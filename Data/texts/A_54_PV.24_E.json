(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Baali (Algeria),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 106\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family: follow-up to the International\r\nYear of Older Persons\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/268)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.6)\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): My delegation believes\r\nthat the commemoration of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons — with the theme “Towards a society for all ages”\r\nand on the eve of the next millennium — is an event of\r\nspecial significance. The United Nations and its relevant\r\norganizations, Member States, intergovernmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — in short, the entire\r\ninternational community — are actively celebrating this\r\nYear by taking concrete measures to make a difference for\r\nthe elderly today and in the years to come. And there are\r\nwell-founded reasons for that.\r\nFor example, according to the United Nations the\r\npopulation growth trend is such that by 2025, when the\r\nglobal population will have reached 8.2 billion, and the\r\nnumber of elderly will have reached 1.1 billion, thus\r\nconstituting a considerable portion of the world’s\r\npopulation. This phenomenon should be welcomed as a\r\nsign that in general life expectancies and standards of\r\nliving are increasing, though, unfortunately, not evenly\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe impact of this phenomenon on the\r\nsocio-economic conditions of societies is already\r\npresenting challenges to Governments. It is in response to\r\nthis phenomenon and challenge that the General\r\nAssembly decided to observe the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons, the primary objective of which is to raise\r\nawareness of the fast-changing demographic global\r\npicture, with its challenges, and to develop and pursue\r\nappropriate strategies and policies at the national,\r\nsubregional, regional and international levels.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to commend\r\nthe Secretariat for the work it has done so that this Year\r\ncould be meaningfully celebrated. We note with\r\nappreciation the Secretary-General’s comprehensive report\r\n(A/54/268), which provides us with a clear overview of\r\nthe progress achieved in the field of addressing the\r\nquestions connected with ageing and the challenges that\r\nlie ahead. The report highlights the activities undertaken\r\nat all levels.\r\nThe highlights of the expert consultation on\r\ndeveloping a policy framework for a society for all ages\r\nannexed to the report, try to present a possible new\r\n“architecture of ageing”, combining strategic thinking\r\nwith pragmatic measures. We believe that Governments\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nand appropriate organizations will find this document not\r\nonly interesting and thought-provoking but also quite\r\nuseful.\r\nSince time immemorial Mongolians have revered their\r\nelders. This has found reflection in our well-known\r\nproverb: “Teachings of elders are priceless”. This is why\r\nthe Constitution of Mongolia makes special reference to\r\nelders. It states that every citizen of Mongolia has the right\r\nto receive financial and material assistance in old age. This\r\nprovision of the Constitution provides a legal basis for the\r\ncare of older people.\r\nMongolia’s population is relatively young. The elderly\r\nconstitute about 8 per cent of the population. Nevertheless,\r\nthey still need our special attention and care, especially\r\ntoday. The reason is that, like many other countries\r\nundergoing fundamental changes, Mongolia is grappling\r\nwith the challenges of the transition period.\r\nIn Mongolia market reforms have been boldly\r\naccelerated by the liberalization of trade and prices, large-\r\nscale privatization and other economic measures. However,\r\nthe reform process has not been without difficulties. And\r\nthese difficulties are directly affecting the lives of our\r\npeople, especially those of the elderly and other vulnerable\r\nsections of society. The income — that is, the pensions —\r\nof the elderly has shrunk enormously on account of\r\ninflation and price increases. Pensions are at or even below\r\nthe minimum subsistence level and thus are not sufficient\r\nto meet the basic needs of normal life. Though pensions\r\nhave been raised in the past, the increases were soon\r\novertaken by inflation and price hikes. The present\r\nGovernment is contemplating raising pensions further.\r\nBearing in mind the difficult situation of older people,\r\nthe State and Government are taking some legal and\r\nadministrative measures to alleviate their burdens. Thus, the\r\nGovernment bears the expenses for health insurance for\r\nolder people, as well as their long-distance travel expenses\r\nincurred in connection with medical treatment. Also, older\r\npeople are entitled to obtain soft loans for the improvement\r\nof their housing conditions. Those living in the capital city\r\nare exempted from city bus fares. As a result of\r\nprivatization, many rural older people have benefited from\r\nthe privatization of livestock. Special care and protection\r\nare provided to lonely people and to those who are\r\nincapable of leading an independent life. They are lodged\r\nin special care centres and are provided with free meals and\r\nclothing. However, these measures are not sufficient to\r\nalleviate the burdens of older people. Much still needs to be\r\ndone.\r\nIn celebrating the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, the Government of Mongolia has declared 1999\r\nas the National Year of Older Persons, and it is taking\r\nconcrete measures to address the problems that they face\r\nin Mongolia. Thus, a national committee has been\r\nestablished and has adopted a comprehensive national and\r\nlocal plan, which is being implemented. The Year and\r\nother relevant activities are also being widely promoted\r\nthrough the mass media.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia recently launched the\r\n1999-2004 National Programme for the health and social\r\nwelfare of older persons. One of the ways of improving\r\nthe living standards of older persons is to provide a\r\nrealistic opportunity for post-retirement employment and\r\nthus enable older people to earn additional income. The\r\nrecent amendments to key socially oriented legislative\r\nacts create a more favourable legal and administrative\r\nenvironment and also create conditions for promoting\r\nsocial welfare and expanding sources of income for older\r\npeople. In addition, the Government has budgeted some\r\nfinancial assistance for older people who are actively\r\nengaged in small- and medium-scale businesses and\r\ncooperatives.\r\nDespite all the support given by the Government and\r\nsome non-governmental organizations to older people,\r\npoverty still, unfortunately, hits them hard. It would take\r\nsome time and considerable economic progress to really\r\nalleviate the hardships of older people. However, the\r\ncelebration of the International Year is in some respects\r\nhelping reduce hardships and to raise awareness of the\r\nproblems involved and the challenges that lie ahead.\r\nRespecting elders is one of the notable traits of our\r\ntraditional society and culture. We always respect and\r\nvalue the constructive roles older people play in society,\r\nincluding their role in the family, organizations, politics\r\nand well-being. As pointed out in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, Mongolia is taking measures to make appropriate\r\nuse of the skills and wisdom of retirees, as well as\r\nencouraging older persons to share their life and work\r\nexperience with the younger generation.\r\nFinally, as a sponsor of the draft resolution on this\r\nitem, my delegation expresses the hope that it will be\r\nadopted without a vote, just as have been similar\r\nresolutions in previous years.\r\nMr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese): The\r\nChinese delegation supports the statement made by the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nrepresentative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nIn 1992, at its forty-seventh session, the General\r\nAssembly adopted a resolution designating the year 1999 as\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons. This was indicative\r\nof the fact that the problem of population ageing has\r\nbecome a major global issue and is attracting wide concern\r\nand attention from the international community. We are\r\nheartened to note that in the years since the 1982 World\r\nAssembly on Ageing, the United Nations has taken a series\r\nof positive steps that have helped make the international\r\ncommunity pay more attention to the issue of population\r\nageing. The decision of the United Nations to make the last\r\nyear of the millennium the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, and its relevant activities at various levels\r\nthroughout the world, are of great significance in further\r\ndrawing the attention of the entire world to the issue of\r\nageing. They are providing a strong impetus for countries\r\naround the world to make efforts to address the issue and\r\nfor the implementation of the United Nations Principles for\r\nOlder Persons.\r\nAs a result of progress in the economic, scientific and\r\ntechnological, educational, cultural and health areas in\r\nChina and improvements in the standards of living of the\r\nChinese people, the average life expectancy of the Chinese\r\npeople has been rising and has now reached approximately\r\n70 years of age. Therefore, both the absolute number of\r\nelderly Chinese and the percentage of our overall\r\npopulation that is elderly are on the rise. It is projected that\r\nby the year 2020 there will be 230 million elderly people\r\nin China, accounting for 15.6 per cent of the overall\r\npopulation. The size of this population is expected to\r\ncontinue to rise, reaching 410 million by the year 2050. By\r\nthen, the elderly will make up 27.4 per cent of the overall\r\npopulation. That means that one out of every four people\r\nwill be elderly.\r\nSuch a huge elderly population and its rapid growth\r\nwill pose a severe challenge to a country such as China,\r\nwhose economy is still not very developed. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has made the issue a high priority and has\r\ntaken action in the areas of legislation and social welfare.\r\nWe formulated the China development plan of action on\r\nageing. In this plan we set specific goals for our work so as\r\nto ensure that elderly people will be supported, enjoy\r\nmedical care, contribute to society, engage in lifelong\r\nlearning and live happily.\r\nGradually a social-welfare system suited to Chinese\r\nconditions is taking shape. This system integrates the role\r\nof the Government, the community, the family and the\r\nindividual. To date we have been successful in trying out\r\nthis programme.\r\nThe Chinese Government vigorously supported the\r\nUnited Nations resolution naming this year the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. We also supported\r\nother relevant resolutions of the Organization. On 28\r\nOctober 1998, on behalf of the State Council and\r\nPresident Jiang Zemin, Vice-President Hu Jin Tao made\r\na nationwide televised speech on the commemoration of\r\nthe International Year. This helped to publicize the\r\nInternational Year and its theme of “a society for all\r\nages”.\r\nThe State Council issued a circular to departments\r\nand ministries under its authority and to local\r\nGovernments at various levels, calling upon them to\r\norganize commemorative activities. The response to date\r\nhas been very active. At the State level, the coordinating\r\nagency for such activities, the China National Committee\r\non Ageing, played an active role in this regard. Large\r\nnumbers of national and local non-governmental\r\norganizations, organizations of the elderly and the media,\r\nand many private associations have carried out\r\ncommemorative activities. In addition, the Chinese\r\nGovernment is working diligently on the report of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China on ageing and will soon\r\nsubmit it to the United Nations. The report will further\r\ndetail China’s commemorative activities for the\r\nInternational Year.\r\nHumanity is moving towards a new millennium, in\r\nwhich the ageing of the population will become a major\r\nsocial issue. It is a particularly complex question for the\r\ndeveloping countries. We call on the United Nations to\r\ntake even more meaningful measures to enrich and\r\nstrengthen the work of relevant United Nations bodies and\r\nagencies and to offer more technological assistance and\r\nsupport to developing countries, especially those with a\r\nlarge population that is ageing at an accelerated rate. We\r\nare confident that, with the concerted efforts of the entire\r\ninternational community, humanity will surely usher in a\r\nsociety for all ages.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\nmy pleasure to speak on this glorious occasion in\r\ncelebration of the International Year of Older Persons, not\r\nonly out of gratitude to those who have devoted their\r\nexperience, energies and lives to the service of society,\r\nbut also out of our belief that their continuous generosity\r\nand accumulated expertise will greatly contribute to a\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nbrighter future. I wish to associate myself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Guyana on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThere is no doubt that comprehensive care for the\r\nelderly is a noble goal that we must seek to achieve either\r\nthrough official institutions and associated authorities and\r\nagencies, or through the voluntary services of popular and\r\ncivil organizations, or by activating and enhancing the\r\ndirect role of the family or foster families in caring for the\r\nelderly. Increased awareness of and improved health care\r\nfor older persons have indeed raised life expectancy to rates\r\nfar higher than those of the past, leading to an exponential\r\nincrease in the proportion of older persons to other age\r\ngroups in Egyptian society. Statistics show similar rates for\r\nmen and women.\r\nIn Egypt, we use age as an objective criterion for\r\ndefining older persons. We do not use the subjective criteria\r\nof the symptoms of ageing, with all its related health\r\nproblems and social implications. This may differ from\r\ncriteria used in other countries. Thus, we consider anyone\r\nover the age of 60 to be an older person.\r\nOur Government bases its policy for achieving a\r\ndignified life for older persons on our tolerant religious\r\nbeliefs and social values, which have been rooted in\r\nEgyptian society since time immemorial. In implementing\r\nour policies, we resort to many tools, including coordination\r\nbetween the institutions that can play fundamental or\r\nauxiliary roles in the provision of services or patterns of\r\ncare or support for the elderly, with a view to maximizing\r\nthe benefits derived from our social policies in this regard.\r\nThe Egyptian Government, represented by the Ministry\r\nof Social Security and Social Affairs, supports civil and\r\nvoluntary work by providing financial contribution or\r\nnecessary technical support to voluntary societies with a\r\nview to involving them in the comprehensive plan for the\r\ncare of older persons. Egypt is conducting a vast campaign\r\nto increase older person’s awareness of their rights. We\r\nhave been collecting categorized data on older persons and\r\ncataloguing all relevant legislations to use as benchmarks in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe Government draws on the skills of experts and\r\nspecialists in the field of psychotherapy for the elderly in\r\norder to prepare them psychologically and socially to accept\r\ntheir ageing. We have been modernizing state services\r\noffered to various social groups, especially those dealing\r\nwith health care for older persons. We have increased the\r\nnumber of offices for home services to older persons and\r\nbuilt new, modern nursing homes for those who are\r\nunable to help themselves medically or financially. Under\r\nthe theme “a society for developed a programme to\r\nestablish links between young and older persons with a\r\nview to achieving continuity between generations through\r\njoint activities that promote interaction and integration of\r\nall age groups.\r\nGiven the importance we attach to the question of\r\nolder persons at the international level, Egypt has\r\nparticipated with the international community in the\r\ncelebrating the International Year of Older Persons. The\r\nGovernment has developed a plan that will be fully\r\nimplemented by the end of October 1999. We have\r\npromoted the International Year of Older Persons in all\r\nmass media — audio, visual and written. We have also\r\nissued a commemorative stamp on the occasion of the\r\nInternational Year and a guide for services available to\r\nretirees and senior citizens. The Government has\r\norganized seminars to discuss the current situation of\r\nolder persons and their physical, psychological and social\r\nproblems, in addition to enhancing the active role that\r\nthey themselves can play in developing their society by\r\nproviding support to families, which are the nuclei of the\r\ncommunity, and in other fields to which older persons can\r\ncontribute.\r\nThere is no doubt that national efforts cannot work\r\nin a vacuum. In order to be fruitful, those efforts must\r\nresult in a favourable international climate supported by\r\ntechnical expertise and financial resources. In this regard,\r\nI would be remiss if I failed to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report in document A/54/268, entitled\r\n“International Year of Older Persons, 1999: activities\r\nand legacies”. The report assesses United Nations efforts\r\nreflecting the prominent place enjoyed by older persons\r\non the international development agenda. We note with\r\nappreciation that the report stresses four fields that are\r\nintrinsically related to the welfare of older persons: the\r\nsituation of older persons, lifelong individual\r\ndevelopment, multi-generational relationships and\r\npopulation ageing and development.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the\r\nconstructive role played by the United Nations system in\r\nall these fields, whether by organizing seminars or\r\nproviding financial and technical assistance to States. We\r\ncall on the United Nations to continue these efforts,\r\nwithout which States cannot implement their national\r\nplans successfully.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nA productive and favourable international climate\r\ncannot be provided without the concerted efforts and the\r\nwill of all members of the international community, be they\r\nStates or organizations. In addition to United Nations\r\nefforts to provide a coordinating framework and carry out\r\njoint action — and we do welcome its activities in this\r\nfield — we believe that individual countries are responsible\r\nfor activating such collective action by providing material\r\nand technical resources.\r\nWe must not overlook the adverse effects experienced\r\nby developing countries as a result of the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization, which impede those countries\u0027 implementation\r\nof their development plans and their efforts to raise the\r\nliving standards of their citizens in a world characterized by\r\na widening gap between the rich and the poor. The numbers\r\nof the rich increase; the “haves” have more and the “have-\r\nnots” have less.\r\nInternational cooperation must acquire a new\r\ndimension that makes the “haves” more responsible, so that\r\nthe fabric of international society does not disintegrate.\r\nUnder these adverse conditions, the developed countries,\r\nmore than ever, must abide by their pledges to development\r\nefforts, including maintaining their official development\r\nassistance levels.\r\nMr. Rahman (Malaysia): I feel honoured to be able\r\nto participate in this meeting of the Assembly on the\r\nsubject of the ageing population, which I am sure is of\r\nincreasing concern to all of us. My delegation congratulates\r\nthe United Nations on its persistent and tireless efforts for\r\nthe past three decades, culminating in the designation of\r\nthis year, 1999, as the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nIt is indeed a timely wake-up call for the international\r\ncommunity to evolve a paradigm shift and change of\r\nmindset on this important issue of the emerging phenomena\r\nof individuals living longer, leading to the growing upward\r\ntrend of ageing in the population of the world.\r\nThe empowerment of women, with an expanded\r\naccess to education and employment, and the advent of\r\nscience and technology with its attendant improvements in\r\nhealth care and lifestyle, have led to a world demographic\r\ntransition in mortality and fertility rate declines, while life\r\nexpectancy is continuously on the rise. These phenomena\r\npresent a new set of challenges and opportunities to all\r\nnations. Their impact on macroeconomic policies and on\r\nsocial and sustainable development, though obvious,\r\nrequires a further in-depth and integrated study and\r\nanalysis.\r\nThe needs of the elderly are basically the same as\r\nthose of other generations: food, shelter, jobs, education\r\nand the protection of legal rights. However, they also\r\nrequire opportunities and support systems to enable them\r\nto enjoy income generation, social security and health\r\ncare. The challenge for Governments now is how to\r\nincorporate and reflect these new, greater needs in their\r\nresource allocations, services and legal and other related\r\ninstitutional frameworks.\r\nThe elderly generation should not be viewed as a\r\ndepreciating asset, as, with a proper set of policies in\r\nplace, they can continue to lead rich and useful lives and\r\ncontribute positively to the community.\r\nThe approach and response to this challenge of the\r\nelderly population may certainly differ from country to\r\ncountry, as each is governed by its own set of traditions,\r\nnorms and values, but the common overriding concern is\r\nto extend care and love.\r\nTraditionally, Malaysian society, with its inherent\r\nreligious beliefs and Eastern social values, extends its\r\ncare and love to the elderly. However, with the\r\nempowerment of women, rising economic well-being and\r\nurbanization, there is already a decline in the number of\r\nextended family units. It is in this context that the\r\nGovernment, together with the private sector, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the community at large,\r\nmay have to actively intervene.\r\nBy the year 2000 the majority of the world\u0027s older\r\npersons, roughly 51 per cent, will reside in urban areas.\r\nIn the developed countries, about 78 per cent of elderly\r\nwomen and 75 per cent of elderly men will be in urban\r\nareas, whereas in the developing countries the majority of\r\nthe older persons of both genders will remain in the rural\r\nareas. Today, when the world population has already\r\nreached 6 billion, 1 in every 10 persons is 60 years of age\r\nor older. By 2030 more than 1.4 billion persons will be\r\nover 60 years old, most of them in Asia and the Pacific\r\nregion. By the year 2050 one out of five persons, and by\r\nthe year 2150 one out of three, will be over the age of 60.\r\nThese demographic projections entail an urgent need for\r\neffective collaboration between Governments,\r\ninternational institutions and private organizations to\r\nformulate an integrated line of action so as to ensure that\r\nthis segment of society is not excluded, marginalized or\r\nmade into an underclass, but taken into the mainstream of\r\nnational life.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nIn Malaysia it is estimated that by the year 2000 about\r\n6.1 per cent of the population, or 1.4 million persons, will\r\nbe age 60 and above. Demographic projection anticipates\r\nthat by the year 2020 the number of elderly in Malaysia\r\nwill rise to 3.2 million persons, or 9.5 per cent of its\r\npopulation. It is in the context of this population trend that,\r\non 25 October 1995, the Malaysian Government formulated\r\nthe National Policy on the Elderly. The policy, inter alia,\r\nincorporates self-respect and honour; self-reliance;\r\nparticipation in life, care and protection; and research and\r\ndevelopment for the well-being of the elderly as the main\r\nthrust of its strategy, which is in line with the five\r\ncategories of the United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons: independence, participation, care, self-fulfilment\r\nand dignity.\r\nIn implementing the international Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing, adopted at the World Assembly on Ageing, held in\r\nVienna in 1982, the Malaysian Government has also\r\napproved the setting up of the National Advisory and\r\nConsultative Council for the Elderly and the Plan of Action\r\non the National Policy for the Elderly. The Plan of Action\r\nis comprehensive and contains proposals for action, as well\r\nas programmes and activities, that need to be implemented\r\nby all governmental agencies, the private sector, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, society, groups and individuals.\r\nThese programmes and activities cover education,\r\nemployment, participation in society, well-being,\r\ntransportation, housing, family support systems, health,\r\nsocial security, the media and research and development.\r\nMalaysia has been observing the International Day of\r\nOlder Persons every year since 1991. Several programmes\r\nwere held to mark the day and to highlight the issue of\r\nageing, with the aim of raising awareness at the multi-\r\ngenerational level in order to promote active participation\r\nand networking.\r\nMalaysia sees the preparation of the entire population\r\nfor the later stages of life as an integral part of its social\r\nand economic development policy framework.\r\nNotwithstanding the empowerment of women, which has\r\nexpanded access to education, employment and family\r\ndecision-making processes, thus leading to an increase in\r\nnuclear families, lower fertility and mortality rates and\r\nlonger life expectancy, Malaysia is taking effective steps to\r\nensure that family ties and values are maintained and that\r\ncaring for the elderly continues to be the family’s\r\nresponsibility.\r\nMalaysia also encourages offspring to take care of\r\ntheir elderly. Since 1992 it has provided tax relief for them.\r\nUnder the Malaysian public sector new remuneration\r\nscheme, medical benefits for public sector employees are\r\nbeing extended to their parents. The Government, both on\r\nits own together with non-governmental organizations, has\r\nalso provided homes for this group. The future design of\r\nlow-cost housing will accommodate the needs of extended\r\nfamilies.\r\nThe action plan to implement the national policy for\r\nthe elderly will heed the features of this International\r\nYear of Older Persons. For the first decade of the new\r\nmillennium, the Government of Malaysia has established\r\nthe Second Malaysian Economic Consultative Council,\r\ncomprising 150 members representing the political parties,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, the private sector,\r\nprofessional bodies and minority groups whose policy\r\ninputs will include ageing population needs in the context\r\nof human resource development, science and technology,\r\npoverty eradication, social engineering and national unity.\r\nAt the international level, Malaysia has participated\r\nactively in conferences focusing on the elderly. The latest\r\nwas the Fourth Global Conference of the International\r\nFederation of Ageing, held from 5 to 9 September 1999\r\nin Montreal, Canada, in conjunction with the International\r\nYear of Older Persons.\r\nMalaysia will continue to take cognizance of\r\nchanges in the characteristics and expectations of the\r\nelderly, such as the need for greater financial and\r\npersonal independence, as well as developing a\r\nrelationship of mutual reliance rather than dependency in\r\nits planning for the elderly. The Government is\r\nconsidering a request by the public service union that the\r\nmandatory age of retirement be increased from the current\r\n55 to 58. There are now plans to provide programmes for\r\nupgrading the skills of older persons to ensure that they\r\ncan continue to be a productive part of society. To\r\nalleviate the financial strain on the Government, there are\r\nalso proposals to develop a private sector safety net and\r\nmedical care system for the group.\r\nThe theme of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons is “Towards a society for all ages”. My\r\ndelegation believes this is rightly so. For every nation in\r\nthis new economy of knowledge and human capital, the\r\ncomponent of the elderly group is never fully depreciated.\r\nThey are indeed a valuable asset deserving generational\r\nequity.\r\nMalaysia is confident that this wake-up call from the\r\nUnited Nations will bring a message of hope and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nfulfilment to the older citizens of the world as they and the\r\nrest of the 6 billion population of the world brace\r\nthemselves for the challenges of the new century and the\r\nnew millennium.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam): Seven years ago,\r\nin 1992, the General Assembly decided to designate 1999\r\nas the International Year of Older Persons. This decision\r\nshows not only a clear vision for the promotion of a society\r\nfor all ages, but also our strong commitment to its\r\nimplementation as we enter a new millennium. Now is the\r\nright time for us to take stock of what has been done and\r\nlook ahead to see what we can further do to accomplish\r\nthis noble cause.\r\nIn every part of the world the situation of the ageing\r\ndepends not only on their individual development, but also\r\nvery much on the social policy of the State, the\r\nsocio-economic situation of the country and the family. Due\r\nto their age and health conditions, older persons belong to\r\na social group with special needs. Under difficult\r\ncircumstances, such as economic or financial crises or\r\ntransformation, they become more vulnerable.\r\nIn my country, older people account for 10 per cent of\r\nthe population. It is an age-old tradition, treasured by the\r\nwhole society, that older people are respected and taken\r\ncare of, because they represent living wisdom. In our\r\npresent State policy, older people are looked upon as a\r\ngeneration which has made a great contribution to our\r\nmagnificent national history. They are also glorified for\r\nhaving delivered, raised and educated younger generations\r\nto continue the cause of national defence and construction.\r\nArticle 67 of our Constitution stipulates clearly that old\r\npeople shall receive State assistance. According to the law\r\non marriage and the family, the primary responsibility for\r\ntaking care of older people is entrusted to their own\r\nfamilies. The State, through its local mechanism, provides\r\nconcrete assistance, such as financial subsidies, housing and\r\nmedical care. The Vietnamese Association of Older\r\nPersons, established four years ago, has a network at the\r\ncommunal level which covers almost 90 per cent of the\r\ncountry’s communes. This is a mass organization, whose\r\nmain functions are to help take care of the material and\r\nspiritual life of older persons and to engage them in the\r\npolitical, social and cultural activities of the local\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn such a national context, Viet Nam has fully\r\nembraced the core concepts and strategies originating from\r\nthe World Assembly on Ageing in 1982 which have guided\r\nobservance of the International Year of Older Persons. On\r\n30 September 1998 the Prime Minister adopted the\r\ninstructions on the observation of the International Year\r\nof Older Persons in Viet Nam. These governmental\r\ninstructions set out targets to be achieved on education on\r\nthe significance and objectives of the International Year\r\nand the adoption of updated regulations and policies on\r\ncare for older people. This document also defined the\r\nduties of the Ministries concerned, as well as coordination\r\nbetween them.\r\nA national committee in charge of the organization\r\nof the International Year in Viet Nam has been set up and\r\nis chaired by a Deputy Prime Minister. The Committee is\r\nresponsible for organizing a nationwide programme to\r\npromote awareness of the significance of the International\r\nYear, as well as of international and national research\r\nachievements with regard to health and other care for\r\nolder persons. The committee has worked out and has\r\nbeen directing the implementation of a national action\r\nplan for the observance of the International Year, aimed\r\nat promoting a happy, healthy and useful life of the older\r\npeople in Viet Nam, encouraging the elderly to participate\r\nin communal activities and hailing and multiplying the\r\ngood practices and positive achievements of individuals\r\nand organizations in taking care of the older people.\r\nImplementation of the national action plan is focused on\r\nthe following: activities to show respect for and love to\r\nolder persons, health care and medical treatment,\r\nupholding the older person\u0027s role in each family and the\r\nwhole society, and responding to their quest for\r\nknowledge improvement and recreational activities in\r\naccordance with their age.\r\nDuring the International Year, the Association of\r\nVietnamese Older People has given particular attention to:\r\nencouraging its members at all levels to study, and make\r\ncontributions through the Association to, the draft\r\nOrdinance on the Care for Older People; reviewing and\r\nassessing the implementation of the Prime Minister\u0027s\r\ninstructions on the observance of the International Year;\r\nand stepping up a nationwide movement of distinguished\r\nolder persons and preparing for a national meeting of\r\ndistinguished older persons from all walks of life, which\r\nwill elect representatives to attend the Conference of\r\nNational Heroes to be convened by the Government at the\r\nend of the year 2000.\r\nGiven severe constraints in the State budget, the\r\nGovernment of Viet Nam has shouldered most of the\r\nresearch spending on ageing and has striven to improve,\r\nstep by step, the basic social services to all, including the\r\nelderly. The Government has also tried very hard to\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\npromote the awareness and willingness of every individual,\r\nfamily and organization with regard to their responsibility\r\nto protect and take care of older people. This has been done\r\nthrough the State educational system, as well as the\r\npropaganda programme carried out by the Association of\r\nOlder Persons. In other words, there is a strong partnership\r\nbetween the Government and society through the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations working for the welfare of\r\nolder people in Viet Nam.\r\nLooking ahead, in view of the fast changes in the\r\nnature and scope of demographic ageing, we do share the\r\nview that we need to further promote investments in human\r\ndevelopment over the entire lifespan and support age-\r\nintegrated social institutions. It is very important to reach\r\nout to the younger generation to help foster multi-\r\ngenerational relationships and to encourage the young to see\r\nbeyond the traditional stereotypes of older persons and gain\r\na more positive image of the ageing process and its effects.\r\nAnother important area is improvement in research and\r\nexchange of information on ageing. We expect that the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons will provide us with the\r\nimpetus for a society truly for all ages in the next century.\r\nMs. Takamura (United States of America): A year\r\nago the United Nations inaugurated the International Year\r\nof Older Persons. While the year has yet to draw to a close,\r\nit is fitting that we gather today to honour the past and\r\nenvision the future.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons has provided\r\nus with a unique opportunity. It has compelled us to pay\r\nmore than the usual attention to changing world\r\ndemographic trends, to consider the opportunities and\r\nchallenges that emerge as a consequence, to envision our\r\nworld in the next millennium, to encourage the\r\ndevelopment of an architecture for longevity and to\r\nstimulate our public and private sectors alike to engage in\r\nthe development of a progressive ageing policy and\r\nprogramme proposals. Thus, we thank the United Nations\r\nfor this special year.\r\nI am pleased to report that during the International\r\nYear of Older Persons we have given strong emphasis in\r\nthe United States to essential policy and programme\r\ndiscussions to prepare for population longevity in\r\nanticipation of the twenty-first century. A launching event\r\nwas held last October in New York City by the United\r\nStates Committee to celebrate the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons. In December, we will formally close the\r\nInternational Year in Washington, D.C., with a special\r\nevent sponsored by the United States Department of Health\r\nand Human Services, the United States Committee and\r\nothers. However, our policy and programme discussions\r\nwill continue well into the future.\r\nLast February, at the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment, our delegation reported on a host of federal\r\nactivities to commemorate the Year. For example, the\r\nDepartment of Labor will hold a national conference on\r\nsenior community service and employment. The\r\nDepartment of Transportation is sponsoring an\r\ninternational conference on “Transportation for an Aging\r\nSociety” preceded by town-hall meetings in communities\r\nacross the United States and Canada. The United States\r\nFood and Drug Administration formed a special agency-\r\nwide committee to offer activities and special\r\ninformational materials aimed at older adults.\r\nIn addition, the Federal Committee for the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, chaired by the\r\nAdministration on Ageing in the United States\r\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, convened a\r\nsymposium in June which brought together nearly 300\r\nsenior administrators from across the executive branch to\r\naddress the policy and programme implications of our\r\nrapidly ageing society. The symposium established a\r\nfoundation to advance United States federal policy and\r\nprogramme agenda for older persons and their families in\r\nthe twenty-first century, focusing specifically upon issues\r\nrelated to economic security, ageing in place, older people\r\nserving as resources, health promotion and care and\r\ndisability and long-term care. During the symposium, we\r\nforged new partnerships to inform our policy and\r\nprogramme endeavours in the future. This unique federal-\r\nGovernment-wide committee will continue its work into\r\nthe next century to encourage innovative and\r\ncollaborative, inter-agency partnerships.\r\nCommunities across America have also\r\nwholeheartedly embraced the International Year of Older\r\nPersons. Our Governors have proclaimed the observance\r\nof the International Year within their states. A number of\r\nstate agencies on ageing — in Illinois, North Carolina and\r\nCalifornia, for example — have developed resource kits\r\nfilled with ideas for the International Year. National\r\nchurch groups, such as the Presbyterian Church\u0027s Office\r\non Older Adult Ministry and the United Methodist\r\nCommittee on Older Adult Ministry, have developed\r\nresource guides for congregations with older adults.\r\nNational ageing and non-ageing organizations have\r\ndedicated their annual conferences and their publications\r\nto the International Year of Older Persons and to the\r\ntheme “Towards a society for all ages”. New York,\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nCalifornia, Michigan and Tennessee produced public service\r\nannouncements about the International Year and established\r\nInternet sites to describe their activities. South Carolina\r\nused the year-long observance to highlight the special\r\ncontributions that older persons make to enriching their\r\ntowns and states. The Pennsylvania Department on Ageing\r\njoined its area agencies on ageing and other Commonwealth\r\ndepartments and agencies and organizations to generate\r\nmore than 500 events during the Year. One area agency on\r\nageing offered special grants to public and private schools\r\nto establish inter-generational programmes or events.\r\nUniversities, hospitals, schools, private companies and\r\nsenior centres all across the United States have all found\r\nmeaningful ways to observe the Year. And of course a\r\nnumber of states participated in the Global Walk, held only\r\na few days ago. These are but a few examples illustrating\r\nthe United States commitment to the goals of the Year.\r\nAs the International Year of Older Persons draws to a\r\nclose, we are mindful of the need to continue the\r\nmomentum which it began. We will continue to draw upon\r\nthe support of multiple partners from the Government\r\nsector, private industries, the non-profit community, the\r\nmedia and educational institutions, just to name a few. We\r\nhave an urgent need in the United States and globally to\r\nprepare our nations for population longevity and to ensure\r\nthat our peoples all have ample opportunity to plan for a\r\nlonger life course and an improved quality of life.\r\nIn closing, I would like to quote Donna Shalala, our\r\nSecretary of Health and Human Services. At the symposium\r\nwe held last June she said,\r\n“As the theme of the International Year tells us, our\r\nmission is to help build a society of all ages — a\r\nsociety where participation and independence and self-\r\nfulfilment and character and dignity aren’t just lofty\r\nprinciples but a way of life for every older American.”\r\nThis is our wish for all nations and for our brothers and\r\nsisters with whom we share the planet.\r\nMr. Ramsaran (Trinidad and Tobago): I am indeed\r\npleased and privileged to participate in these plenary\r\nmeetings of the General Assembly on the follow-up to the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. I also wish to associate\r\nmyself with the statement of Guyana, made on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe aged have worked long and hard, and to ignore\r\nthem would be the worst kind of cruelty. We need to\r\nintegrate them into society and involve them in all aspects\r\nof the developmental process of our nations. They have\r\nmuch to offer and we need to receive the treasures they\r\nhold. The designation of 1999 as the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons gives the international community the\r\nopportunity to focus effectively on this unprecedented\r\nphenomenon of population ageing and its implications\r\nglobally, regionally and nationally.\r\nIt is anticipated that between the years 2000 and\r\n2050 the world population could increase by 54 per cent\r\noverall, by 241 per cent for persons over the age of 65\r\nand by 380 per cent for persons over 80. Furthermore, the\r\nmajority of older persons live in developing countries, and\r\nit is estimated that their population will exceed 70 per\r\ncent by the year 2030.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is also faced with an\r\nunprecedented growth in its population aged 60 years and\r\nover. The results of our 1990 population census indicate\r\nthat 8.5 per cent of our population is over 60 years of\r\nage. This figure is projected to increase by 13.9 per cent\r\nby the year 2000, slightly higher than our overall\r\npopulation increase. Further projections indicate that by\r\nthe year 2020 their numbers are expected to increase to\r\n15 per cent of the population. Our projections for life\r\nexpectancy assume rates of 70.62 for males and 74.7 for\r\nfemales by the year 2010. The population growth of older\r\npersons can be expected to be even higher with the new\r\ntrend of return migration. A recent survey of return\r\nmigrants indicates that approximately 18.4 per cent of\r\nreturning migrants were 60 years old and over.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago has\r\nadopted the United Nations conceptual framework for\r\nobserving the International Year of Older Persons, which\r\nidentified its theme as “Towards a society for all ages”.\r\nThis theme was developed and integrated into the\r\noperational framework and the four dimensions identified\r\nwere “Raising awareness: the society for all ages”,\r\n“Looking ahead beyond 1999”, “Reaching out: non-\r\ntraditional actors” and “Networking: research and\r\ninformation exchange”.\r\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, a national coordinating\r\ncommittee comprised of representatives of governmental,\r\nnon-governmental and private sector organizations was\r\nconstituted to plan activities to observe the Year. The\r\nYear was officially launched on 30 September 1998 by\r\nthe Prime Minister, The Honourable Basdeo Panday, at a\r\ncultural function which recognized the contributions to\r\nsociety of outstanding older persons.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nTo raise awareness about the theme and the objectives\r\nof the Year, numerous activities have been conducted\r\nlocally. The main ones include the publication of several\r\narticles in the print media containing relevant issues on\r\nolder persons; the distribution of information packages to\r\nmedia houses, non-governmental organizations and local\r\nGovernment bodies for further dissemination; the launching\r\nof a public awareness week; the sensitization of the public\r\nvia radio and television programmes and the airing of a\r\nspecially commissioned music video entitled “Blessed Are\r\nthe Elders”; a holding of a conference on the issues\r\nassociated with active ageing hosted by the University of\r\nthe West Indies; the conducting of health clinics and fairs\r\nfor older persons by both governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental agencies; and radio interviews with senior\r\ncitizens. A Web site on issues relating to older persons is\r\nin the process of being established. This year the\r\nInternational Day of Older Persons focused on the\r\nhonouring of centenarians, in addition to which the Ministry\r\nof Social and Community Development hosted a luncheon\r\nfor older persons.\r\nInitiatives have also been taken to achieve an age-\r\nintegrated society. These include the introduction of\r\nneighbourhood day-care services. For this initiative, young\r\npersons trained in geriatric care provide daily care services\r\nto needy older persons in various communities throughout\r\nthe country. In an effort to build inter-generational\r\nrelationships, summer camps were conducted in Tobago for\r\nchildren between the ages of 8 to 14 years of age, with\r\nretired older persons serving as facilitators. Training courses\r\nwere also organized for care-givers for older persons. These\r\ncourses targeted care-givers at institutions and also those\r\nwho provide care to older relatives and friends at family\r\nresidences.\r\nIn looking ahead, and with regard to research, the\r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago is currently conducting\r\na national survey of the living conditions of older persons.\r\nThis seeks to collect data on the economic-psycho-social\r\nconditions of the elderly in Trinidad and Tobago and the\r\nphysical conditions under which they live. We expect to do\r\nan evaluation of the needs of the elderly based on the\r\nsurvey data and to analyse the impact of the projected\r\ngrowth in this population sub-group on health-care needs,\r\nhuman resource development, housing, change in family\r\ncircumstances and the provision of social services.\r\nThis year, the Government again increased the\r\nquantum of non-contributory old age pension to persons 65\r\nyears old and over. Approximately 60,000 persons benefit\r\nfrom this financial support. Furthermore, the income ceiling\r\nfor pension eligibility was increased, allowing additional\r\nnumbers of senior citizens to benefit. National insurance\r\nretirees enjoyed higher pensions with the introduction of\r\nnew measures under the national insurance scheme at no\r\nadditional costs to senior citizens. The 1998-1999\r\nappropriation bill proposed to soften the costs of\r\npharmaceuticals for certain illnesses which are mainly\r\nsuffered by the aged.\r\nApart from economic and social security benefits,\r\nthe Government provides housing and transportation relief\r\nfor needy senior citizens. This year, a facility was\r\nintroduced through the National Commission for Self-help\r\nto undertake repairs to houses of needy senior citizens\r\nutilizing non-governmental organizations or community-\r\nbased organizations as monitoring and implementing\r\nagencies. Financial contributions to nine Government-\r\nassisted homes for the aged were also increased.\r\nAn area of grave concern is the care of older\r\npersons. I am pleased to say that, at present, the\r\nMinistries of Health, Social and Community\r\nDevelopment, and Planning and Development are\r\ncollaborating on the introduction of a programme of\r\ncommunity care that will incorporate ageing-in-place\r\nprogrammes and home-care for senior citizens.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons has\r\nchallenged us to review and initiate policies to ensure that\r\nwe promote the United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons. Under the auspices of the Ministry of Social and\r\nCommunity Development, a Committee has been\r\nestablished to develop a national policy on ageing before\r\nthe end of 1999. That policy will deal with the challenges\r\npresented by this demographic revolution and with the\r\ninnovative strategies and programmes required to respond\r\nto the heterogeneity of the population of older persons,\r\ntheir needs and expectations. It will of necessity focus on\r\nan integrated approach to the lifelong and society-wide\r\nprocess of ageing, the effects of globalization and the\r\ninformation explosion in order to realize a society for all\r\nages.\r\nAt the regional level, Trinidad and Tobago has\r\nendorsed the Caribbean Charter on Health and Ageing.\r\nThe components of this Charter include “Creating\r\nSupportive Environments for Older Persons at Home, in\r\nthe Community and in Long-Term-Care Facilities”;\r\n“Primary Health Care and Health Promotion”; and\r\n“Economic Security, Employment and Other Productive\r\nActivities for Healthy Ageing”.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nIn the area of best practices for a society for all ages,\r\nTrinidad and Tobago has introduced several programmes in\r\nthis respect. These include the Geriatric/Adolescent\r\nPartnership Programme; the Adopt-an-Elderly/Adopt-a-\r\nHome Programme; and the Retiree/Adolescent Partnership\r\nProgramme. A Senior Citizens Bureau has also been\r\nestablished, and talk shows aimed at creating linkages\r\nbetween younger and older persons will soon be produced.\r\nAnother initiative of the non-governmental sector is the\r\ncreation of peer support groups intended to build solidarity\r\namong older persons.\r\nWithout doubt, much more is required to promote this\r\nvision of active and healthy lifelong ageing. There is a need\r\nto incorporate ageing modules in our school curriculum. If\r\nwe are to truly create a “society for all ages”, we need to\r\ntarget our youth and equip them with new knowledge so\r\nthat they can reach their own later years as the beneficiaries\r\nof good health, income security and supportive social\r\nnetworks. We need to introduce formal training in\r\ngerontology at the tertiary level, and revisit issues of gender\r\ninequality, particularly as we recognize the tendency for\r\nwomen to live longer than men and their expanding role as\r\na result of urbanization, migration and the high incidence\r\nof HIV/AIDS.\r\nLet me assure the Assembly that the issue of ageing\r\nhas been placed high on the agenda of the Government of\r\nTrinidad and Tobago. Only recently my Government, at the\r\nparliamentary level, participated in the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean Symposium on Older Persons, held from\r\nSeptember 8-10, in Santiago, Chile.\r\nWe recognize that there is an urgent need to put in\r\nplace the required measures to deal with this unprecedented\r\nand rapidly occurring phenomenon. I look forward to the\r\ncontributions of my colleagues at these memorable plenary\r\nmeetings and to share experiences and best practices to\r\npromote the interests of our older persons and to prepare\r\nsociety and the world as we enter the new millennium. This\r\nis important for future generations of senior citizens, a\r\ngroup towards which I myself am progressing.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): First of all, I\r\nshould like to associate myself with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Guyana, speaking on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nIn Africa, there is a saying that an old person dying is\r\nlike a library burning. This alone reflects the importance\r\nthat African societies attach to older persons.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the excellent report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the activities and legacies of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. It provides a wealth\r\nof facts about older persons and multi-generational\r\nrelationships in the world, and it suggests a strategic,\r\nholistic approach to ageing based on the 62\r\nrecommendations of the International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing and the 18 United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons.\r\nAgeing in all human societies is both a success story\r\nand a challenge for humankind. I say a success story\r\nbecause of the tremendous scientific advances that have\r\nenabled us to overcome some diseases and to effectively\r\ntreat or prevent others that can cause premature death. to\r\nbe treated or prevented effectively. Life expectancy has\r\nincreased, including in the developing countries. In short,\r\nthe living standards of peoples have improved.\r\nBut it is also a new and major challenge for public\r\nhealth and social integration. When the United Nations\r\nlaunched on 1 October 1998 in New York the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, with the theme\r\n“Towards a society for all ages”, it sought specifically to\r\nfocus the attention of the international community on the\r\ndaunting challenge of ageing during the third millennium.\r\nMy country, Senegal, welcomes this positive\r\ninitiative and the important work done by the United\r\nNations system, the non-governmental organizations and\r\nother actors of civil society throughout this year. I should\r\nlike to mention in particular the activities of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and its Consultative Group\r\nfor the International Year, as well as the useful work\r\ndone by the Coalition 99 group to disseminate the\r\nobjectives of the year and to raise awareness of the\r\nchallenges to be met to build an open, integrated, unified\r\nsociety.\r\nIn Senegal, people over 55 represent 7.6 per cent of\r\nthe population. That percentage will rise to 21 per cent in\r\n2010.\r\nBecause of our longstanding African traditions,\r\nwhich confer a special role and status on older persons,\r\nand taking due account of the contribution of the elderly\r\nto the balance of society, and in particular to the\r\neducation of young people, my country has always given\r\nhigh priority to the question of older persons. In 1987, a\r\nnational committee on ageing was created, and a national\r\nday for older persons was proclaimed.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nThe initiatives and activities undertaken by Senegal\r\nsince the launching of the International Year have made a\r\ngreat contribution to resolving the concerns of the elderly\r\nthroughout our national territory. The Councils of Wise\r\nPersons that were set up on that occasion continue to be\r\nvenues conducive to reflection, initiative and dialogue\r\namong older persons and, through their suggestions and\r\nproposals, help to guide the activities of local and State\r\nbodies in the area of social policies.\r\nThis political will is also reflected in a national plan\r\nof action drafted together with organizations for older\r\npersons, which each year are given an audience with the\r\nPresident of the Republic.\r\nSenegal\u0027s plan of action seeks to promote what we call\r\n“productive old age”. It also seeks to protect and assist\r\nolder people by making it easier to finance projects for\r\nthem, improving their access to credit and establishing\r\nspecialized health centres. My Government is thus seeking\r\nto create an enabling environment for integrating older\r\npeople into the social fabric. It is also doing its best to\r\neliminate gender disparities and inter-generational conflict.\r\nAlthough in Africa we may not have the same\r\nconstraints as the developed countries with regard to the\r\nchallenges of ageing, studies show that the rate of increase\r\nof the older population in developing countries is now more\r\nthan double that in developed countries. In our countries\r\nextreme poverty is now very often creating situations that\r\nare harmful to the health of older people.\r\nIt is therefore important to step up our efforts within\r\nthe United Nations to combat the exclusion and\r\nmarginalization of older people so as to promote their\r\nintegration into our assistance and social protection systems,\r\nincluding where there are humanitarian crises and conflicts.\r\nBecause the elderly represent a precious asset for society,\r\nand not a separate group, we must promote respect for their\r\ninalienable human rights if, together, we want to build a\r\nsociety for all ages.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil): Of all the major transformations\r\nin the structure of Brazilian society over recent decades,\r\nnone has been more far-reaching than the revolution in its\r\ndemographic dynamic. Due to a sharp decrease in birth\r\nrates and to a substantial increase in life expectancy, the\r\nBrazilian population is ageing. Whereas in 1960 those over\r\n60 years of age accounted for roughly 3 per cent of the\r\ntotal population, this age bracket now represents 9 per cent,\r\nor more than 13 million Brazilians.\r\nThe longevity of individuals is clearly the direct and\r\nhighly desirable outcome of improvements in social and\r\nhealth-care services. By contrast, its corollary, the ageing\r\nof the population as a whole, generates increased\r\ndemands for facilities, benefits and assistance. This trend\r\npresents a pressing challenge for Governments and\r\nsociety, one which will only intensify over the coming\r\nyears. Ageing is just as much a cause as a consequence\r\nof profound social, economic and cultural changes under\r\nway in society. Therefore, dealing with its implications\r\nrequires an integrated approach and concerted efforts,\r\nboth at the national and international levels, if we are to\r\neffectively move “towards a society for all ages”.\r\nAlthough the intensity of this phenomenon varies\r\nfrom country to country, and even within regions of the\r\nsame country, ageing has been a concern to the United\r\nNations since the 1950s. The first response by the United\r\nNations was the convening, in 1982, of a World\r\nAssembly devoted to the issue and the adoption of the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing, which was\r\nendorsed by the General Assembly. In 1991 the General\r\nAssembly adopted the United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons, and in 1992 it decided to proclaim 1999 the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons.\r\nThe Brazilian National Policy for Older Persons,\r\nenacted in 1994, enshrines the goals and guiding\r\nprinciples adopted by the General Assembly in 1991. It\r\nseeks to preserve and enhance the social rights of the\r\nelderly by fostering their self-reliant, integrated and\r\nmeaningful interaction in society. The guiding principles\r\nof this policy are: non-discrimination of any kind;\r\nunderstanding that the ageing process concerns society as\r\na whole; respect for economic, social and regional\r\nvariation as well as differences between urban and rural\r\nareas that affect older persons; and, finally, recognition of\r\nthe joint responsibility of State, families and civil society\r\nin ensuring older persons\u0027 rights and participation in\r\ncommunity life and protecting their dignity and well-\r\nbeing.\r\nIn order to achieve these goals, the national policy\r\nsets priorities for governmental actions in health care,\r\neducation, housing and urbanization, cultural life, sports\r\nand leisure activities and human rights as they relate to\r\nthe elderly. Almost by definition, health-care needs and\r\ncosts are greatest for the elderly. Therefore, the Brazilian\r\nGovernment attaches especially high priority to preventive\r\nquality health-care services for the aged. Family members\r\nand community centres, rather than nursing homes and\r\nother institutions, are encouraged to take the lead in\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\ncaring for them. Out of respect and regard for those who\r\nhave a lifetime of service to society, Government policy\r\nseeks to foster a sense of social responsibility to the older\r\ngenerations and commends active volunteer work in this\r\nfield.\r\nOne fundamental outcome of the ageing process,\r\nespecially in developing countries like Brazil, is the\r\nincrease, both in relative and in absolute terms, in the\r\nnumber of economically dependent individuals and groups\r\nand the drain on public resources. So as to secure the rights\r\nof pensioners, today and tomorrow, a far-reaching\r\nGovernment-proposed constitutional amendment has been\r\nenacted. As a result, the welfare regime is being replaced\r\nby a more sustainable, socially just, democratic and\r\naccountable system.\r\nYet a revitalized welfare system alone will not address\r\nall the needs and expectations of our elders. The labour\r\nmarket cannot remain immune to this demographic\r\nrevolution. The Brazilian Government has risen to the\r\nchallenge of generating new opportunities for those aged 60\r\nand over. The Ministry of Labour, together with the\r\nMinistry of Social Security, is providing professional\r\ntraining for the elderly in order to better prepare them for\r\nthe demands of an increasingly competitive and\r\nknowledge-based job market.\r\nAn important clearing house for these multiple tasks\r\nis the Brazilian Committee for the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons. It has prepared a programme covering the\r\nmain aspects relating to the ageing process, including\r\nworkshops and seminars held throughout the country. Great\r\nemphasis has been given to the debate on how to\r\nimplement the National Policy for Older Persons, with a\r\nview to making recommendations to the federal\r\nGovernment, targeting the specific needs of the five\r\ndifferent regions of the country. On the other hand, state\r\nand local governments have joined hands with volunteer\r\norganizations in promoting practical and cost-effective\r\nmeasures. These include an influenza vaccination campaign\r\nfor the elderly population, social integration activities\r\nthrough sports and leisure and education campaigns for\r\nsocial workers to teach them about gerontology.\r\nBrazil is truly committed to becoming a society for all\r\nages. Yet if we are to guarantee the effective social\r\nintegration of the elderly, we must first address the\r\nunderlying challenge of ensuring that all have a productive\r\nand fulfilling life. That challenge is the eradication of\r\npoverty. Never is poverty more dramatic and despairing\r\nthan when it affects the most vulnerable groups. It shatters\r\nthe hope of youth and denies dignity to those in the\r\nautumn of their life.\r\nTo ensure a better quality of life to those advanced\r\nin age is a responsibility we all share towards the old as\r\nwell as the new generations.\r\nMr. Suh (Republic of Korea): As we stand at the\r\nthreshold of a new millennium, we face numerous new\r\nissues fraught with challenges yet ripe with opportunities.\r\nOne such issue concerns the older members of our\r\nsociety.\r\nWhile the pace of the current demographic trend\r\ntowards an older population differs from nation to nation,\r\nthe sheer magnitude of the numbers bespeaks a sweeping\r\ngreying of global society. Given the immensity of this\r\ndemographic shift, we must cultivate the hidden resource\r\nrepresented by older persons. For without their active\r\ninvolvement no society will be able to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe observance in 1999 of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons, under the theme of “Towards a society for\r\nall ages”, was thus particularly timely. Within that\r\nrelatively short span of time, many important objectives\r\nwere achieved. Among the successes was the\r\nestablishment of a policy framework for achieving an age-\r\nintegrated society; this framework, which has been refined\r\nthrough in-depth debate at various conferences and\r\nmeetings at all levels, should prove of great benefit to\r\npolicy-makers. In addition, media campaigns and other\r\nevents commemorating the Year promoted public\r\nawareness not only of the needs of the elderly but also of\r\ntheir untapped potential.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons thereby\r\ncontributed to a radical rethinking of our concept of the\r\nelderly, who are traditionally relegated to the role of\r\npassive victims and a societal burden. The new perception\r\nis that older persons constitute an invaluable part of our\r\nhuman resources, and, indeed, that they are indispensable\r\nto the process of social development.\r\nRecognizing that none of these achievements would\r\nhave been possible without the dedicated efforts of the\r\nConsultative Group for the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, the Secretariat and the many non-governmental\r\norganizations involved in this issue, my delegation would\r\nlike to express its thanks to them.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nI now turn to my own Government\u0027s policies\r\nconcerning older persons, and to the efforts undertaken by\r\nthe Republic of Korea in support of the Year. The Republic\r\nof Korea has long striven to improve the lot of its elderly.\r\nIn June 1981 it enacted the Welfare Act for Older Persons,\r\nwhich set forth three guiding principles adhering to the\r\nUnited Nations Principles for Older Persons: first, to ensure\r\nsound, stable, healthy lives for the elderly as people of\r\ndignity; secondly, to provide the elderly with employment\r\nopportunities and a chance to participate in social activities;\r\nand thirdly, to harness the unique knowledge and expertise\r\nof older persons in the service of social development. Since\r\nenacting the Welfare Act, the Government of the Republic\r\nof Korea has steadily refined its policies for the elderly. As\r\na result, over the past two decades, most of Korea\u0027s elderly\r\nhave enjoyed a range of benefits including medical\r\ninsurance and old age pensions. But these policies often\r\ntargeted only the most vulnerable segments of the elderly\r\npopulation, such as the destitute or the disabled.\r\nRapid demographic changes, together with the\r\nsupplanting of the traditional, extended family by the\r\nnuclear family, demanded a new approach. The nation\r\nneeded an enhanced, comprehensive and long-term strategy\r\nthat would encompass all older persons. Responding to that\r\nneed, earlier this year the Korean Government formulated\r\nan action plan on mid- to long-term development directions\r\nfor the health and welfare of the elderly in preparation for\r\nan ageing society in the twenty-first century. The new plan\r\nplaces emphasis on building up the productive capacities of\r\nolder persons and nurturing their social interaction on the\r\nindividual, family and community levels. To help ensure\r\nthat the lives of the elderly are sound and stable, the\r\nnational pension scheme was expanded in 1999 to cover\r\nvirtually all citizens. The intent is to make that programme\r\na cornerstone of income security for older persons.\r\nRegarding the health of Korea\u0027s elderly, the health care\r\nsystem is being revamped to accommodate the special\r\nneeds of senior citizens.\r\nJob opportunities for the elderly are also increasing.\r\nMore and more job placement centres are focusing on older\r\nworkers, and special vocational training is also being made\r\navailable. In the legislative arena too, the Government is\r\nstriving to create a favourable environment for expanding\r\nemployment opportunities for the elderly.\r\nThe Korean Government has also made it a priority to\r\ndevelop measures that will enable older persons to continue\r\ntheir social activities in the pursuit of self-fulfilment. To\r\nthat end, the Government will broaden its financial\r\nassistance to senior-citizen centres, and plans are afoot to\r\nopen a significant number of new facilities.\r\nMy Government is also striving to strengthen the ties\r\nof the elderly to their communities. Old age can,\r\nunfortunately, be a lonely time; by playing active\r\ncommunity roles, older people gain a new, larger sense of\r\nfamily and enrich the entire social fabric. The Korean\r\nGovernment is working to encourage such community\r\nbonds by promoting local volunteer associations and\r\ndeveloping life-long education programmes.\r\nIn addition to those concrete policy initiatives, the\r\nKorean Organizing Committee for the International Year\r\nof Older Persons and the relevant government authorities\r\nhave organized numerous events this year on the theme\r\n“Towards a society for all ages”. Since February,\r\nnationwide radio has broadcast weekly debates on this\r\ntheme, and public awareness campaigns have been\r\nconducted via publications, advertisements and the\r\nInternet. Similarly, the national fair on the ageing\r\nindustry, held in May, drew public interest and stimulated\r\nprivate-sector investment in that industry. Events designed\r\nto strengthen multi-generational relationships, a tradition\r\nthat has deep roots in our culture but that has faded in\r\nrecent years, were also successful.\r\nOf particular significance among the initiatives was\r\nthe Consult the Elders gathering held at the presidential\r\noffice in January. Representatives from organizations for\r\nthe elderly met with President Kim Dae-jung to discuss a\r\nvariety of ageing-related issues and to submit policy\r\nrecommendations. Such gatherings are expected to be\r\nheld at regular intervals, giving older persons a direct\r\nhand in policy formulation and implementation.\r\nAs highlighted in the report of the Secretary-General\r\non preparations for the Year (A/53/294), the best\r\npreparation for the greying of our society is to invest in\r\nall phases of life and to foster an environment supportive\r\nof the elderly. The Korean Government will step up its\r\nefforts to promote investments in life-long human\r\ndevelopment and to support age-integrated institutions.\r\nTo achieve those objectives, it is essential that we\r\nshare our experiences and ideas. In that vein, my\r\ndelegation applauds the efforts by the Secretariat, with the\r\nsupport of the Government of the Netherlands, to develop\r\nan Internet-accessible database of public policies and\r\nprogrammes on ageing. I am also pleased to note the\r\nsuccess of the Interregional Expert Consultation on\r\nDeveloping a Framework for Policies for A Society for\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nAll Ages and of the Sixth Asia/Oceania Regional Congress\r\nof Gerontology, held in Seoul this past June.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to the Secretariat\u0027s report\r\non the global impact of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons and to the discussions being held in these plenary\r\nmeetings. The report will provide us with a meaningful\r\nframework for enhancing our long-term policies for the\r\nelderly.\r\nRegarding resolution 37/2 of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development, my delegation strongly supports the\r\nconducting of a review in 2002 of the outcome of the\r\nWorld Assembly on Ageing, focusing on topics such as the\r\ninterrelationship between ageing and development.\r\nEven when the International Year of Older Persons\r\nhas officially concluded, let us not lay this issue to rest.\r\nRather, let us build on the progress made during the Year,\r\nusing that as a starting point for the concrete work to be\r\ndone. It is our strong belief that the new millennium will be\r\nan era of prosperity if we succeed in mounting a common\r\neffort to construct a society for all ages. The Government\r\nof the Republic of Korea will continue to do its part to\r\naccomplish this objective and remains open to the\r\ninnovative ideas of others as we all prepare for the\r\nchallenges to come.\r\nMr. Rosin (Israel): The declaration by the United\r\nNations of 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons\r\nwas welcomed in Israel and was implemented through the\r\nappointment by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare\r\nof a public committee to celebrate the year in the spirit of\r\n“a society for all ages”. Respect for the aged has been a\r\ntime-honoured concept in Jewish tradition, as expressed in\r\nthe Torah, our Holy Scripture, which was handed down at\r\nMount Sinai thousands of years ago.\r\nIn the book of Leviticus it is written,\r\n“Stand up in the presence of the aged, and\r\nhonour the face of the old man, and you shall fear\r\nyour God: I am the Lord” (The Holy Bible, Leviticus\r\n19:32).\r\nThis commandment has been translated into the practical\r\nreligious laws of Israel, both during exile and now in the\r\nlaws and society of the State of Israel.\r\nThe proportion of older persons in Israel has grown\r\nfrom just over 3 per cent at the time of the declaration of\r\nthe State in 1948 to almost 10 per cent of the population of\r\n6 million in 1998. In Tel Aviv, the largest city, the\r\nelderly number 17 per cent of the population. The fastest-\r\ngrowing segment among elderly people in Israel is those\r\nover 75, of which the capital, Jerusalem, contains the\r\ngreatest number. Massive immigration has contributed to\r\nthe almost tenfold increase in the total population since\r\n1948, many of the immigrants are old, but much progress\r\nhas been made in service arrangements and legislation on\r\nbehalf of older persons. A special example is the unique\r\nNursing Insurance Law of 1988 for the disabled elderly,\r\nwhich provides for extra personal help at home, for\r\ndressing, washing, et cetera. In the first year of the Law’s\r\nexistence, 21,359 people received its benefits, compared\r\nto the 5,000 who received equivalent services in 1987. In\r\n1998 the number had risen to 82,519. In 1995 the average\r\nproportion of elderly people in Jewish towns who\r\nreceived services was 12.6 per cent; in the Arab sector it\r\nwas 15.3 per cent — the highest rate in the country was\r\n25 per cent, in Kafr Kanna, which is a large Arab town.\r\nA more detailed report about the activities of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons will be circulated\r\nhere tomorrow. That report describes specific themes\r\nrelating to the International Year, how they have become\r\npolicy and have been implemented during the Year. The\r\nareas of activity include fostering relations between the\r\nyoung and the elderly, with particular emphasis on\r\neducational programmes; enhancing the image of the\r\nolder person; communication among the elderly; and\r\nissues regarding the health of the elderly. Other\r\nprofessional activities relate to charters of the rights of the\r\nolder person, the United Nations Charter, the charter of\r\nwomen’s rights, the charter of the rights of the elderly\r\nsick person, legislative recommendations and academic\r\nmeetings and conferences. For productive life in old age,\r\nvoluntarism has been emphasized as a fulfilling activity.\r\nCreativity among the elderly has been fostered through\r\nwriting and photographic competitions, which will lead to\r\nthe exhibition and publication of their writings\r\nrespectively. Many public events and media presentations\r\nhave taken place with the participation of the older\r\npopulation throughout the country.\r\nThe appointed committee consists of about 50\r\nrepresentatives from various branches of society —\r\nacademic, service, organizational, ministerial and\r\npolitical — that are dealing with the healthy and disabled\r\nelderly. As of now, it has met four times, once with the\r\nparticipation of the Minister of Social Welfare. From this\r\ncommittee were formed subcommittees dealing with\r\nwelfare and society, the elderly and their environment,\r\nhealth, and economic and legislative issues. These\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nsubcommittees have met several times during the year. In\r\naddition, various key persons, mainly from the social\r\nservices sector in 10 geographical areas throughout the\r\ncountry, were appointed to form local working groups,\r\nwhich are responsible for implementing the decisions of the\r\ncommittees and for carrying out local activities on their\r\nown initiative.\r\nMuch emphasis has been placed on inter-generational\r\nactivity. Pupils in secondary schools undertake to assist\r\nolder people in the community and in residential homes as\r\npart of a personal obligation, and this takes different forms\r\nin accordance with local initiative and custom. For example,\r\nin the mixed Jewish-Arab population of Nazareth, the Arab\r\nChairman of the local team for the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons reported that there were four meetings\r\ninvolving grandfathers and schoolchildren, which covered\r\nsome of the early history of the settlement of the town.\r\nInterestingly, a social worker there composed a song in\r\nArabic about the International Year of Older Persons, which\r\nwas distributed to pupils.\r\nEshel, the Association for the Development of\r\nServices for the Aged in Israel, organized a photographic\r\ncompetition for schoolchildren, focusing on the way of life\r\nof old people from Jewish, Arab, Druze and other\r\npopulations in Israel. The photographs included a Jew at\r\nprayer, an old disabled man being fed by his grandchildren,\r\nArab women in traditional dress and others, and these were\r\nexhibited in the Jerusalem Theatre and in an illustrated\r\ncalendar celebrating the Jewish New Year in September. In\r\nmany schools, the pupils visit pensioners in their homes or\r\naccompany them for security reasons when they go to\r\ncollect their pension. Joint workshops and seminars,\r\nvoluntary projects carried out together and combined choirs\r\nof young and old are other examples of this collaboration.\r\nTopics of special one-day academic symposia held\r\nthroughout the year have included “The aged in Jewish\r\ntradition”, “Ageing in the era of understanding”,\r\n“Intergenerational relationships”, “Ageing towards the\r\ntwenty-first century”, “Typology of the aged population in\r\nIsrael” and, tomorrow, a symposium at Ben-Gurion\r\nUniversity in Beer Sheva on “Futurism in Ageing”. A\r\nnumber of conferences for older people have been held\r\nthroughout the country, including workshops in which they\r\nwere asked to express their questions, doubts and opinions\r\nabout ageing in our country.\r\nCreativity in old age has to be seen to be believed: a\r\ncompetition for people over the age of 70 to write about\r\ntheir views on ageing has attracted more than 100 entries,\r\nincluding quite a few poems. The intention is to publish\r\nmany of them as a book, which will serve as a literary\r\nand academic source for the study of ageing. Similarly,\r\nthe work submitted for a photographic competition\r\nbetween elderly photographers will be exhibited this\r\nmonth in Jerusalem.\r\nThe question of insurance for long-term nursing-\r\nhome care has been discussed in the subcommittees. It,\r\ntogether with a number of legislative issues, such as\r\nmedications for the elderly and recompense for care-\r\ngivers, will be brought by our Committee to the\r\nKnesset — parliamentary — Committee on Social\r\nWelfare in two weeks\u0027 time.\r\nDiscussions of health are only one aspect. Last week\r\nwitnessed a march in Jerusalem of 6,000 pensioners, as\r\npart of a national health programme of walking for the\r\nelderly. This group activity will be continued under expert\r\nvolunteer guidance in coming years. Voluntarism as a\r\nregular occupation of the older person has also received\r\nmuch attention, and the organization of volunteer societies\r\nhas been upgraded during the course of the Year.\r\nIn conclusion, perhaps the most result of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons — after the memories\r\nhave faded of the entertainments, conferences, radio and\r\ntelevision presentations and other publicity — should be\r\na continuation of the momentum to enhance the positive\r\nimage of the old person. The healthy should be\r\nencouraged to be more active, and the needs of the\r\ndisabled and their caregivers demand ever-increasing\r\nattention. We hope that the International Year of Older\r\nPersons 1999 will project its positive lessons about the\r\nolder population well into the next century. As we enter\r\na new millennium, it is timely to remember the forecast\r\nof the prophet Zechariah:\r\n“Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Old men and old\r\nwomen will yet sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each\r\none with his staff in his hand . . .\r\n“And the streets of the city will be full of boys\r\nand girls playing in its streets.” (The Holy Bible,\r\nZechariah 8:4, 5)\r\nMs. Göransson (Sweden): The United Nations\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons has led to increasing\r\ninternational awareness of the needs and capacities of\r\nolder people. From statements we have heard today it is\r\nobvious that the Year has stimulated activities throughout\r\nthe world.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nSweden has the highest proportion in the world of\r\npeople aged over 65 and over 80. In Sweden 17.4 per cent\r\nof the population are over 65, and almost 5 per cent are\r\nover 80. Sweden already has some experience of the\r\ndevelopments many other countries are now facing. And yet\r\nthe proportion of elderly people in Sweden will continue to\r\nrise; in 20 years one in four Swedes will be over the age of\r\n65. The growing number of senior citizens will require new\r\napproaches to the task of organizing a society for the well-\r\nbeing of all. Not only is the proportion of elderly and old\r\npeople increasing, but these people will also differ in\r\ncertain respects from today\u0027s old-age pensioners. For\r\nexample, most of them will be healthier and better\r\neducated. Already one in four people reaching pensionable\r\nage has a mother or father who is still alive.\r\nThe increasing number of elderly people in our\r\ncommunity should be seen as an achievement and a\r\nchallenge. It is an achievement because more people have\r\nhad a better chance of living longer lives of high quality. It\r\nis a challenge because we know that in general elderly\r\npeople are in greater need of health and medical care and\r\nof social welfare services.\r\nDuring the 1990s Sweden suffered a profound\r\neconomic crisis, perceived by many as a threat to their\r\ncommon welfare. Now that the economy is recovering its\r\nbalance, measures are being taken to restore the quality and\r\nthe content of our social welfare services.\r\nThe elderly and their welfare are priority issues for the\r\nSwedish Government. Just over a year ago the Government\r\npresented a national action plan regarding policies for the\r\nelderly. The plan includes national policy goals and\r\nmeasures to improve elderly care in the years to come. And\r\nmay I point out that one particular problem confronting\r\nelderly care services in Sweden is the difficulty we have —\r\nand will increasingly have — in recruiting staff in sufficient\r\nnumbers. The number of people of working age will decline\r\nin the twenty-first century. Caring for the elderly is a low-\r\nstatus occupation in Sweden, and people who work in the\r\nelderly care sector are mainly women. This is something we\r\nare actively seeking to change.\r\nIn Sweden national, regional and local activities\r\norganized in connection with the International Year have\r\nprompted wide-ranging discussions on policies for the\r\nelderly. Let me mention a few issues.\r\nFirst, an important element in the ongoing\r\ndevelopment of Swedish society is its transformation into\r\nan information society. The older section of the population\r\nis at risk of being excluded from those areas of\r\ndevelopment that presuppose an interest and a degree of\r\nproficiency in the use of computers. Information\r\ntechnology can be used to enhance and disseminate\r\nknowledge and promote a just society. And, because it\r\ncan facilitate dialogue between voters and their political\r\nrepresentatives, it is also an ideal tool for strengthening\r\ndemocracy.\r\nTo prevent the growth of new divisions in society,\r\nwe must guarantee that knowledge about information\r\ntechnology and the skills to use it are made available to\r\nall. To this end, we must ensure that nothing prevents\r\ndevelopment from reaching everyone in the community,\r\nregardless of age, disability or location. In one recent\r\nevent, which took place concurrently in virtually every\r\nlibrary in Sweden, elderly people were invited to try their\r\nhand at surfing the Internet. The initiative met with the\r\ngreatest interest, and thousands of elderly women and\r\nmen came to the libraries. The purpose was to help more\r\nolder people overcome the initial resistance most of us\r\nfeel when confronted with new technologies.\r\nAnother issue is the meeting of generations. An\r\nimportant factor in the creation of a society for people of\r\nall ages is our ability to counter antagonisms between the\r\ngenerations and create meeting places where knowledge\r\nand experience can be fruitfully exchanged. We live in a\r\nyouth-fixated society where opportunities for public\r\ndiscussion between young people and the elderly are at\r\nbest infrequent. When today\u0027s teenagers in Sweden reach\r\nthe age of 40, they will be living in a society in which\r\nevery fourth citizen is over 65. Now is the time for them\r\nto start thinking about the kind of society they want, and\r\nabout how they themselves will be regarded by the young\r\nwhen they get older. A national essay competition for\r\nschool pupils and an inter-generational conference are two\r\nexamples of activities carried out during the International\r\nYear.\r\nOver the years we have learned that one of the most\r\nimportant conditions for high-quality elderly care is\r\ncooperation between the health care and social services.\r\nWe want to live a long life and we want to remain\r\nhealthy. Many people look forward to retirement in the\r\nhope of enjoying an active, fulfilling life that lasts many\r\nyears. The last few years have seen a growing interest in\r\nmeasures aimed at preventing ill health among the elderly\r\nin Sweden.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nThe Government is now supporting several long-term\r\npilot projects involving outreach activities among the\r\nelderly. A condition of this support is that these activities\r\ninclude staff from both the health care and social services.\r\nMany of the proposed measures set out in the national\r\naction plan relate to the development of user participation\r\nin and influence on the support and assistance provided by\r\nthe care services for the elderly. The reception accorded to\r\nthe elderly and the degree to which they and members of\r\ntheir families can take part in the care they receive is one\r\nof the most important aspects of quality development in this\r\narea. During the International Year, we will seek to\r\nhighlight examples of activities in which user participation\r\nplays a prominent part.\r\nLet me, finally, turn to the importance of changing\r\nattitudes. Creating a society for people of all ages — where\r\nour senior citizens can take part and have a say in the\r\ndecisions affecting the community at large and where young\r\npeople will want to work in health care and services for the\r\nelderly — calls for a radical change in attitude towards the\r\nelderly and the ageing. One challenge is to change attitudes\r\nand bring people to regard the elderly as a resource. We\r\nalso need to change the elderly’s picture of themselves as\r\nbeing retired from community life. A fundamental concern\r\nin shaping policies for the elderly is therefore to transform\r\nattitudes and to enhance respect for older people. In this\r\nregard we have a lot to learn from other cultures.\r\nI have sketched the broad outlines of Sweden’s\r\npolicies for the elderly and the reforms we are undertaking.\r\nI believe they demonstrate the Swedish Government’s\r\ncommitment to pursuing politics that are in line with the\r\nobjectives of the International Year. But of course we\r\nrealize that conditions and opportunities vary from country\r\nto country. In designing and implementing strategies and\r\nprogrammes for international cooperation, we must seek to\r\nbuild our policies upon the common understanding that all\r\npeople are fundamentally equal and entitled to the same\r\nrights.\r\nMr. Alemán (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): Today we\r\nhave gathered to celebrate the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, paying well-deserved tribute to those who have\r\nreached a stage in their lives in which the family and the\r\nState have important parts to play in the creation of a\r\nsociety based on more equitable and human parametres for\r\ntheir benefit.\r\nTime is an old cosmic magician who measures man\r\nand mankind with different yardsticks: a very short one for\r\nthe human being, an almost endless one for mankind. But\r\neven if man’s sojourn on Earth is brief, science and\r\nexperience accumulated by mankind over the years have\r\nallowed humanity, particularly in this century, to make\r\nsignificant conquests. Life expectancy has grown by 20\r\nyears since 1950. Today, one out of 10 inhabitants of the\r\nplanet is over 60; it is expected that, by the year 2050,\r\none in five will be of that age, most of whom will live in\r\nthe developing world. It is also a fact that women have a\r\ngreater life expectancy than men and their situation\r\ndeserves special consideration. We must therefore join\r\nforces in attempting to resolve the ancient problems that\r\ncontinue to confront mankind: poverty, inequality and the\r\nlack of development and social justice.\r\nPoverty is a mandatory topic if we wish seriously to\r\naddress the problems of one of the most vulnerable\r\ngroups of society: the elderly. In this respect, Ecuador is\r\nno stranger to the slow-down in world economic growth;\r\nin fact, we may now be experiencing our most severe\r\ncrisis in this century, exacerbated by an enormous burden\r\nof external debt. Together with poverty, inequity directly\r\naffects the most vulnerable. The unequal distribution of\r\nwealth is accompanied by a social security system that\r\nbenefits only a narrow sector of society and does not\r\nprovide universal access to pension and health systems to\r\nthose over 65.\r\nWe must point out, however, that the Government of\r\nEcuador has not been paralysed by adversity. In 1980, the\r\nMinistry of Social Welfare created a bureau dedicated to\r\nthe interests of older citizens. In 1991, the National\r\nDepartment of Gerontology was established as the organ\r\nin charge of planning, assessing, developing and\r\nmonitoring programmes for that sector of the population.\r\nToday, it coordinates the plans, programmes, projects and\r\nactivities linked to the celebration of the International\r\nYear. Similarly, the National Council for Women pays\r\nparticular attention to the problems of older women.\r\nI wish briefly to introduce some of our national\r\ninitiatives to create a society for all ages.\r\nThe Law for Senior Citizens has just been adopted\r\nto replace the Special Law for Older Persons. The new\r\nLaw is essentially dedicated to providing access to a\r\nstandard of living that ensures medical care, food,\r\nclothing and housing for all Ecuadorian citizens over 60.\r\nIn this respect, the National Department of Gerontology\r\nis developing a campaign to disseminate information and\r\nincrease awareness about legislation for the elderly and\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nThe National Human Rights Plan has a specific\r\nchapter on senior citizens.\r\nThe Ministry of Social Welfare has developed a\r\nprogramme to train grass-roots staff working in national\r\ngerontology centres in order to improve care for the elderly.\r\nGeneral regulations have been drafted to standardize\r\nthe functioning of the gerontology centres.\r\nIn April 1999, the Ecuadorian chapter of the Ibero-\r\nAmerican Intergovernmental Network for Comprehensive\r\nPolicies for Senior Citizens was established, uniting\r\nrepresentatives of public and private organizations, senior\r\ncitizens’ organizations and gerontology centres throughout\r\nthe country.\r\nThe Project for Technical Cooperation between the\r\nMinistry of Social Welfare and the World Food Programme\r\nwas officially introduced. It is designed to fund and provide\r\nfood for centres, community dining rooms, training\r\nworkshops and recreational centres for the elderly.\r\nOne of the most moving activities initiated by the\r\nNational Department of Gerontology was coordinating the\r\nNational Network for the Global Embrace of the Aged,\r\ninitiated on 2 October.\r\nThe Government of Ecuador welcomes initiatives to\r\nestablish a long-term strategy for facing the challenges of\r\nan ageing population. We therefore consider that it would\r\nbe suitable to review and reassess the 1982 International\r\nPlan of Action on Ageing. We also support the idea of\r\nconvening a second world assembly on ageing in 2002 to\r\ndiscuss the issue of older persons. We are grateful to the\r\nGovernment of Spain for having offered to host that\r\nimportant meeting.\r\nBefore concluding, allow me to place on record the\r\nrecognition of the Government of Ecuador of the untiring\r\nefforts of the coordinators of the Consultative Group for the\r\nInternational Year of Ambassador Julia Tavares de Alvarez\r\nof the Dominican Republic and of Mr. Aurelio Fernández\r\nof Spain. We also thank the Division for Social Policy and\r\nDevelopment Policy and its Director, Mr. John Langmore,\r\nthe Coordinator of the Year, Mr. Alexandre Sidorenko, the\r\nstaff of the unit and programme on ageing and all those\r\nwho contributed, directly or indirectly, to giving this Year\r\nspecial significance.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to commend the\r\ndecisive input and close cooperation of the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, both Ecuadorian and\r\ninternational, who inspired us in our work, remained open\r\nto dialogue and were always ready to undertake joint\r\nprojects.\r\nMay the International Year of Older Persons lead us\r\nto reflect seriously on the pressing need to face the\r\nchallenge of jointly creating a society for all ages.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative\r\nof the Sudan.\r\nMr. Khalil (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Today we\r\nmeet to observe a highly cherished and significant\r\noccasion: the International Year of Older Persons, in\r\nappreciation of and gratitude for the lofty status of this\r\nimportant societal category. The Year also recognizes its\r\neffective role in raising families and generations. In 1982,\r\nthe World Assembly on Ageing adopted the International\r\nPlan of Action on Ageing. The General Assembly\r\ndesignated the year 1999 as the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons under the theme “Towards a society for all\r\nages”. It was decided by resolution 52/80 that Members\r\nwould meet to review the States’ follow-up activity to the\r\nYear.\r\nI would like to add my country’s voice to the\r\nstatement made by Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nCare for the elderly in the Sudan is primarily a\r\nconcerted social responsibility. As a social institution and\r\nthe nucleus of society, the family is responsible for\r\nproviding care to its citizens, especially the elderly. The\r\nSudanese society pays special care and attention to the\r\nelderly, extending respect, love and appreciation. Any\r\ndeparture from this rule is a deviation from the social\r\norder. The elderly’s long life experience qualifies them to\r\noffer advice on matters of family and society.\r\nSimilarly, all religions hold older persons in high\r\nesteem and place them on a pedestal. God Almighty has\r\ndecreed:\r\nThy Lord hath decreed\r\nThat ye worship none but Him,\r\nAnd that ye be kind\r\nTo parents. Whether one\r\nOr both of them attain\r\nOld age in thy life,\r\nSay not to them a word\r\nOf contempt, nor repel them\r\nBut address them,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nIn terms of honour.\r\n[The Holy Koran, XVII:23]\r\nElderly women in the Sudan have a distinct and\r\nimportant role in society. They convey wisdom and\r\ntraditions to the succeeding generations and contribute to the\r\nupbringing of generations. They are known for their great\r\ncontribution to national struggle, particularly in the battles\r\nfor independence and advocacy of women’s rights.\r\nThe Sudan launched its celebrations of this noble\r\noccasion on 1 October 1998, which coincided with the United\r\nNations celebrations and those of the rest of the world. My\r\ncountry has abided by resolution 229 adopted by the Arab\r\nMinisters for Social Planning regarding the celebration of\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons from October 1998\r\nto October 1999. Given the attention granted by my\r\nGovernment to his matter, the Ministry for Social Planning\r\nadopted, in April 1998, a ministerial resolution setting up\r\na national committee composed of all authorities working\r\nin the area of the elderly. The celebration included many\r\nactivities reflecting the interest of the State and society in\r\nthe elderly. A popular celebration was held under the aegis\r\nof the Vice-President, at which mass institutions, the elderly,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, the World Organization on\r\nCare for the Elderly and the United Nations representative\r\nto the Sudan took part. The grandmothers and the grandfathers\r\nof the Sudan were honoured.\r\nIt has been decided that observance of this occasion will\r\ntake place throughout schools and various places of worship,\r\nby devoting the first classes in school to identifying the issues\r\nrelating to the elderly and how to provide care for them.\r\nSimilar activities were carried out in mosques and churches.\r\nCelebrations were held throughout our provinces. Furthermore,\r\na postage stamp was issued in celebration of this occasion.\r\nA workshop on the health of the elderly was held with a view\r\nto setting up a national plan to provide health programmes\r\nfor them. Among the most outstanding achievements of the\r\ncelebrations of this Year for the elderly has been the\r\nelaboration of a draft law on care for the elderly in 1999.\r\nThe final text will be formulated and adopted by the end of\r\nthis year.\r\nThe Sudan also participated in many external meetings\r\nin celebrating this Year. We took part in the symposium on\r\nthe elderly held in Tunisia in October 1998, presenting a\r\nworking paper on the elderly in the Sudan.\r\nThe elderly, as is known, are the most vulnerable group.\r\nMore than any other group, they need the attention and care\r\nof their families, society and Governments. Yet we see wars\r\nraging in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa,\r\nthat directly affect the provision of basic needs to the elderly,\r\nsuch as health care, nutrition and security. There is a need\r\nto raise awareness of the status and position of the elderly\r\nduring wars and conflicts. National and international potential\r\nshould be harnessed to provide for their needs and to create\r\nan atmosphere of stability and tranquillity for them.\r\nThe gap between the developing and developed\r\ncountries is widening daily as a result of the disparity\r\nbetween development rates and gross national product, the\r\nspread of disease, especially AIDS, the lack of resources\r\nand insufficient official development assistance. This\r\nconstitutes a challenge that should be faced and addressed\r\nin the light of the facts before us.\r\nPopulation growth alone does not, in our view,\r\nconstitute a problem for developing countries as much as\r\nit poses a question about creating a climate favourable to\r\nthese people to fully satisfy their needs in their old age.\r\nTherefore, we see a need for creating a just social and\r\neconomic international order that does not differentiate\r\nbetween rich and poor countries.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to emphasize our commitment\r\nto the issues of older persons and their rights, through the\r\nelaboration of comprehensive strategies and programmes\r\nin this field, at all levels. I wish to extend my thanks to\r\nAmbassador Alvarez of the Dominican Republic for her\r\ncontinuous and valuable efforts in this celebration of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. We wish success to\r\nall in these deliberations.\r\nMs. Belinda Manahan (Philippines): I join other\r\ndelegations who have earlier congratulated Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab on his election as President of this Assembly, which\r\nremains an important forum for the expression of individual\r\ncountries\u0027 views and priorities. I express our confidence\r\nin his able stewardship in leading this Assembly to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\r\nMy delegation would like to express our appreciation\r\nto the Secretary-General for his report on the activities\r\nrelating to this year\u0027s celebration of the International Year\r\nof Older Persons. The report is clearly an effort to describe\r\nin summary form the various initiatives around the world\r\nin response to the issue of ageing populations. Our year-long\r\ncelebration dedicated to older persons is a fitting tribute\r\nto and a recognition of the many contributions older persons\r\nhave made to the growth and development of our societies.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note the many innovative actions\r\nby and approaches of various countries.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nToday the Philippines launches its plan of action for\r\nolder persons, marking the culmination of the country\u0027s year-\r\nlong celebration of the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nThe nationwide observance of the International Year is our\r\nresponse to General Assembly resolution 47/5 declaring 1999\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons. The celebration has\r\ninvolved not just Government but also non-governmental\r\norganizations and the many and vibrant associations of older\r\npersons in the country. To celebrate the International Year,\r\nwe have conducted seminars on ageing and older persons.\r\nWe have given national awards to older persons in the areas\r\nof resource generation, community service and leadership\r\nand elderly-friendly establishments. We have held photo\r\nexhibits, poster design contests and trade fairs. Last Saturday,\r\nthe Philippines joined the Global Walk event dedicated to\r\nolder persons. Quite fittingly, the event was dubbed “The\r\nFamily Walk for Grandparents”.\r\nThe tradition of providing family care to older persons\r\nis enshrined in our Constitution, which states that it is the\r\nduty of the family to take care of its older persons while the\r\nState may design a social security programme for them. This\r\npolicy and tradition lives on, as can be seen in the fact that\r\nonly 5 per cent of the older population live alone, while the\r\nmajority reside with their immediate family. Recognizing the\r\ncentral role that the family plays in the care and nurture of\r\nolder persons, the Philippine plan of action aims to develop\r\na holistic and multi-generational care programme for older\r\npersons within the Filipino family network.\r\nThe formulation of the Philippine plan was guided by\r\nthe Macau Declaration and Plan of Action on Ageing for Asia\r\nand the Pacific adopted by the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific in a resolution sponsored\r\nby the Philippines at the Commission\u0027s fifty-fifth session, in\r\nApril 1999. Following the lead of the Macau Plan of Action\r\non Ageing, the Philippine plan of action likewise addresses\r\nseven areas of ageing-related concern.\r\nThe needs and problems of the sector are many, ranging\r\nfrom family finances to a perceived decline in respect for\r\nthe elderly; the remarkable increase in the incidence of\r\ndegenerative diseases among older persons; an environment\r\nthat has been planned largely for young people; the lack of\r\nbasic social services in the community where most older\r\npersons are; the high illiteracy rate; and the unscrupulous\r\nmarket practices to which older persons are becoming\r\nincreasingly at risk.\r\nAttention to the plight of older Filipinos did not begin\r\nwith the country\u0027s observance of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons. Before 1999, two significant laws had already\r\nbeen enacted. Republic Act 7432 seeks to maximize the\r\ncontribution of senior citizens to nation-building and grants\r\nthem benefits and privileges. The Act created an office of\r\nsenior citizens\u0027 affairs in every city and municipality,\r\nprimarily to monitor the implementation of the legislation\r\nand programmes within their jurisdictions and the release\r\nof nationally uniform identification cards which provide\r\n2O per cent discounts at recreational centres and restaurants,\r\nand on medicines and transportation. To date, a total of 1,495\r\nmunicipal and 82 city offices of senior citizens\u0027 affairs have\r\nbeen established.\r\nRepublic Act 7876 establishes a senior citizens\u0027 centre\r\nin every city and municipality in the Philippines. To date,\r\nthere are 201 senior citizens\u0027 centres nationwide which are\r\nbeing managed by local senior citizens themselves. There\r\nare 3.7 million older persons, or 77 per cent of the total\r\nelderly population, who are members of the Federation of\r\nSenior Citizens\u0027 Associations of the Philippines, the biggest\r\numbrella organization of older persons.\r\nCurrently, there is a Bill pending in Congress — The\r\nMagna Carta for Older Persons — that seeks to establish\r\na comprehensive, long-term, national programme that would\r\ngive older persons continued opportunities for employment,\r\nlivelihood projects and access to formal and non-formal\r\neducation and social services, specifically in the area of\r\nhealth and housing.\r\nIn order to uplift their living conditions, our\r\nGovernment provides various programmes and services for\r\nolder persons, including skills training and the provision\r\nof capital assistance for income-generating activities;\r\norganization of community-based associations for older\r\npersons that provide them with opportunities for socialization,\r\nself-expression and self-enhancement; mobilization of older\r\npersons for peer outreach, child protection services, family\r\nlife enrichment and similar projects; assistance for the\r\nphysical rehabilitation of older persons; substitute family\r\ncare for abandoned, neglected, unattached and homeless\r\nolder persons; and, last but not least, after-care and follow-up\r\nservices for those discharged from residential care facilities.\r\nThe State attaches priority to keeping the Filipino family\r\nwhole and intact, it being the main source of care and\r\nemotional support to the older person and the basic unit\r\nresponsible for preparing the younger generations for ageing.\r\nYet the poverty that afflicts many Filipino families and\r\ncommunities hinders the provision of adequate care and\r\nsupport to older persons. We are responding to this reality\r\nby creating critical partnerships between and among local\r\nand national governments, civil society and other sectors\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nin order to maximize resources and direct them to the neediest\r\nareas, sectors, communities and families.\r\nThe Philippines draws from its rich experiences in the\r\nobservance of the International Year of Older Persons as we\r\nmake the following recommendations. First, we urge the\r\nUnited Nations to further intensify its initiatives to strengthen\r\nthe family to enable it to continue providing care to the elderly\r\nand preparing its members for productive ageing. Secondly,\r\nsince lifelong preparation for ageing entails the provision of\r\nbasic services for human development, including the expansion\r\nof coverage of social security schemes, especially in the\r\ninformal sector, the United Nations needs to urge Member\r\ncountries to adopt and implement the 20/20 compact, whereby\r\n20 per cent of gross national product and 20 per cent of\r\nofficial development assistance are allotted to the provision\r\nof basic social services. Thirdly, we need to understand more\r\nfully the implications of globalization for ageing and older\r\npersons. Initially, we see among these the need for lifelong\r\neducation and consumer protection to enable older persons\r\nto cope with the rapid changes and demands of increasingly\r\ninterdependent economies and societies. These areas require\r\ncooperation among nations.\r\nFinally, we reiterate our belief in the benefit of learning\r\nfrom each other\u0027s experiences. While countries experience\r\ndemographic transition differently, and while the strategies\r\nof one country cannot be adopted by another indiscriminately,\r\nthere is much to learn from each other in helping older\r\npersons live more meaningful and rewarding lives beyond\r\n1999, the International Year of Older Persons, and into the\r\nnext century.\r\nMr. Kiselev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):\r\nIt is a great honour for me to participate in the plenary\r\nmeetings of the General Assembly devoted to such a topical\r\nsubject as the situation of older persons.\r\nWe agree with the assertion that respect and concern\r\nfor older persons have always, and everywhere, been an\r\nabiding sign of human civilization. Despite their age people\r\nof the older generation are a constant source of the joy of\r\nlife and social optimism. They guarantee moral and cultural\r\nvalues and are an example of a humanitarian attitude to life\r\nand self-sacrifice for their families and society as a whole.\r\nThe decision of the General Assembly to proclaim 1999\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons immediately found\r\na positive response in the Russian Federation, where the\r\nproportion of people of pensionable age is 20 per cent. In\r\nthe near future this proportion will grow. We view the\r\nobservance of the International Year of Older Persons in\r\nRussia as an important stage in the State\u0027s activities in the\r\ninterests of the older generation, one opening up new\r\nopportunities for improving the situation of older persons\r\nand enhancing their role in the social, economic and cultural\r\nlife of the country.\r\nFor the successful observance of the International Year\r\nof Older Persons, the President of the Russian Federation\r\nand the Government adopted appropriate decisions, set up\r\nan organizational committee and approved the basic events\r\nof the Year. Similar measures were implemented in the\r\nconstituent entities of the Russian Federation.\r\nEvents within the International Year of Older Persons\r\nin Russia are taking place against the backdrop of constant\r\nadditional measures that are being taken by the Government\r\nto enhance legal guarantees, to reform the pension system,\r\nto improve health care and supplies of medicines, to develop\r\nthe network of social services for senior citizens and to\r\nenhance services in the social, cultural and educational fields.\r\nA special federal programme for 1997-1999 entitled “The\r\nSenior generation” is being carried out for 1997-1999 with\r\na clear social orientation. Its implementation has been\r\nextended by the Russian Government to the year 2000.\r\nPractical activities in the interests of older persons are based\r\non the achievements of the Russia\u0027s gerontology, which has\r\na history going back more than 40 years and which has made\r\na considerable contribution to the elaboration of new methods\r\nto care for older people.\r\nThe observance of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons in the Russian region has entailed practical events\r\ndesigned to mitigate the negative effects of ageing and the\r\nresultant individual and group problems. These events, which\r\nshow how we care for older persons, also include ceremonial\r\nand festive rallies, information and propaganda events and\r\ncultural and international events. The strategy of holding\r\nevents under the International Year of Older Persons in many\r\nregions has been developed on the basis of special\r\nsociological research.\r\nWork relating to the International Year and a conceptual\r\nbase have received understanding and support from Russian\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the media. They are\r\nshowing increased willingness to involve older persons in\r\nsocial-oriented activities and take into account the needs\r\nof older readers and radio and television audiences. More\r\ndiversified information is being provided about various\r\naspects of the situation of senior citizens.\r\nParticular attention during the Year was paid to the\r\ndissemination and implementation of the United Nations\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nPrinciples for Older Persons in order to add life to their years,\r\nnot just years to their lives. In implementing the Principles,\r\nthe Russian Federation is attempting to find optimal solutions\r\nto socio-economic, family, household, psychological and many\r\nother problems of the elderly and to create conditions for a\r\nhealthy, safe and dignified old age.\r\nMonitoring the situation of the older generation has\r\nrevealed the presence of three common problems of the elderly\r\ncitizens of Russia: worsening health, low income and\r\nloneliness. The specific situation of older Russians today is\r\nthat the objective social risks associated with the onset of\r\nold age are made worse given the transitional state of our\r\neconomy.\r\nWe in Russia have felt with particular acuteness how\r\ndifficult it is to find an optimal model for the transition to\r\nmarket conditions. The Russian Government is doing\r\neverything it can to ease for the elderly the social costs of\r\nlast year\u0027s economic and financial crisis as much as possible.\r\nNow that we have managed to implement priority measures\r\nto resolve this crisis situation — curbing inflation, ensuring\r\nrelative stability of our currency, preventing a catastrophic\r\nslump in production — the job of improving living standards\r\nand quality of life, including for people of pensionable age,\r\nhas once again come to the fore.\r\nPursuant to the tasks assigned by the President of the\r\nRussian Federation and the Government, urgent measures\r\nare being taken to raise pensions and to carry out pension\r\nreform. We are planning to develop in the near future a\r\nconcept for a State social policy for older persons for the\r\nperiod up to 2005, which will implement the ideas of a society\r\nfor people of all ages.\r\nToday the provisions of agreed United Nations documents\r\nthat directly call on the United Nations system organizations\r\nand international financial institutions to provide support to\r\neconomies in transition and to implement policies to improve\r\nthe system of social welfare, including for elderly citizens,\r\nare as relevant as ever before. In our view, United Nations\r\nfunds and programmes should pay more attention to the\r\nsituation of older people when working out technical assistance\r\nprojects for countries in transition. Specific areas of\r\ncooperation in this field could be the training of specialists\r\nin social and socio-cultural services for older people, working\r\nout recommendations to improve the pension system and an\r\nexchange of scientific information on the achievements of\r\nfundamental and applied gerontology. We hope that all these\r\nquestions will be considered, and taken into account during\r\nthe review of the International Plan of Action on Ageing.\r\nThe observance of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons under the auspices of the United Nations will\r\ndefinitely give a new impetus to our efforts to guarantee\r\na happy old age and longevity for those to whom we owe\r\nour lives, education and basis for social development. The\r\ncontinuity of generations should never be interrupted. Older\r\nmen and women are the keepers of invaluable life\r\nexperience. Our care, assistance and responsibility for the\r\ndestiny of our older fellow citizens will inspire them with\r\ncourage and patience and give them strength for further\r\nlife. By showing true love reinforced with care and\r\nunderstanding to older persons we, through our common\r\nefforts, are establishing the basis of a future society and\r\ngiving it timeless humane values, which will help us respond\r\nin a fitting manner to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nMr. Powles (New Zealand): New Zealand welcomed\r\nthe designation of 1999 by the United Nations as the\r\nInternational Year of older Persons. older people around\r\nthe world contribute to the diversity and richness of our\r\nsocieties and communities. The International Year has been\r\na time to celebrate and value that contribution. It has also\r\nbeen an opportunity to improve understanding between\r\ngenerations, as well as our understanding of the impact of\r\ngrowing ageing populations on societies around the world.\r\nIn New Zealand, the International Year has provided\r\nan important opportunity to build on the standards set by\r\nthe International Plan of Action on Ageing. The fundamental\r\nprinciples of the year - independence, participation, care,\r\nself-fulfilment and dignity - flow from the respect any society\r\nshould hold for its older people. New Zealand has worked\r\nto incorporate these principles into our International Year\r\nactivities.\r\nNew Zealand’s theme for the International Year has\r\nbeen “Valuing Older People”. Our objectives, which flowed\r\nfrom this theme, were two-fold: to promote positive attitudes\r\nto ageing and older people and to prepare for an ageing\r\npopulation. The Year has provided a focus for older people\r\nto demonstrate the many ways in which they participate\r\nand contribute to the community. Media interest in activities\r\nundertaken during the Year has assisted in raising the profile\r\nof older people and increasing knowledge about continuing\r\nopportunities for community involvement in older age.\r\nActivities during the International Year of Older Persons\r\nin New Zealand were structured around three dates during\r\nthe Year, each with its own theme. The first was 1 February,\r\nfocusing on valuing the contributions of older people and\r\nproductive ageing. This date coincided with the removal\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nof an upper-age limit in New Zealand’s human rights\r\nlegislation, thereby prohibiting discrimination in the workplace\r\non the basis of age. Two national conferences were held to\r\nexamine the effects of these legislative changes and issues\r\nfor older people in the workplace. The focus around this time\r\nwas on productive ageing and valuing the contributions of\r\nolder people.\r\nOn 15 May, further activities for the International Year\r\nfocused on the theme of valuing relationships between young\r\nand old. The fifteenth of May is also the United Nations\r\nInternational Day of Families, providing an opportunity to\r\nreinforce the Government’s commitment to strengthening\r\nfamilies and valuing the role of older people in the\r\nfamily/whanau. Activities in May had an inter-generational\r\nfocus. The main event was the launch of the LinkAge\r\nhandbook for developing and maintaining inter-generational\r\nprogrammes. The handbook has been distributed to every\r\nprimary and secondary school in New Zealand and to over\r\n300 older people’s and other community organizations.\r\nFinally, on 1 October New Zealand celebrated the United\r\nNations International Day of older Persons with activities\r\nfocusing on the value of older people. The day was marked\r\nthroughout New Zealand by local celebrations, displays and\r\nevents, including New Zealand’s contribution to the World\r\nHealth Organization’s Global Embrace. The Tower Senior\r\nAchievers’ Awards, which recognize the contributions of older\r\nvolunteers, were presented by our Governor-General at\r\nGovernment House in Wellington.\r\nThe New Zealand Government supported projects with\r\na focus on positive ageing through funding to 24 community\r\norganizations throughout New Zealand. A communication\r\nstrategy was undertaken aimed at increasing awareness about\r\npositive ageing and the ways in which older people do, and\r\ncan continue to, contribute to the community. The Government\r\nhas produced and distributed over 20,000 information kits\r\nsince October 1998 to organizations throughout New Zealand.\r\nA Web site was established to provide information about the\r\nnational strategy for the Year, including the key dates and\r\nthemes and ideas for involvement.\r\nAn important component of this Year’s observance has\r\nbeen the work of volunteer community coordinators in\r\nlocations throughout New Zealand. These volunteers, recruited\r\nthrough older people’s and Maori organizations, played a\r\nsignificant role in promoting the Year and encouraging\r\nactivities in their local community.\r\nFunding was also provided for a specific research project\r\nto investigate and identify factors which allow older people\r\nto remain independent. The research will provide\r\nrecommendations for policy and service delivery.\r\nFeedback from local communities suggests that one\r\nof the most significant outcomes from the International Year\r\nof Older Persons has been the development of new and\r\npositive relationships between different groups working\r\ntogether on projects and activities during the Year. It is\r\nexpected that these relationships will strengthen in the future,\r\nbuilding on the positive achievements of the Year.\r\nMy Government appreciates the support and information\r\nwhich has been regularly provided by the United Nations\r\nprogramme on ageing and, in particular, by its Director and\r\nCoordinator of the International Year of Older Persons,\r\nAlexandre Sidorenko. We congratulate the Director and\r\nhis team on their fine efforts over the Year.\r\nBy valuing the contribution of older persons we\r\nempower them to play a productive and fulfilling role in\r\nour societies. We can all build on the positive achievements\r\nof the Year to continue to promote positive attitudes to\r\nageing and older people and to ensure that the needs of our\r\nageing populations can be met.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): All of us gain a lot by an\r\nextended lifetime: the young are offered a chance to grow\r\nold and the old to grow older. From everybody’s point of\r\nview, demographic ageing is not a curse, but a blessing in\r\ndisguise. It falls on us all to make the most of these new\r\nopportunities. Therefore, my country warmly welcomes this\r\ndebate to explore together the nature and scope of\r\ndemographic ageing throughout the world and the impact\r\nit has on the individual, the family and society, as well as\r\non economies and cultures.\r\nMy Government also strongly appreciates the efforts\r\nof the United Nations programme in preparing for the Year\r\nwith the underlying theme of “A society for all ages”, as\r\nwell as the report of the Secretary-General presented in\r\ndocument A/54/268, which is central to this important issue.\r\nAs a legacy of the commemoration of the International\r\nYear of Older Persons and its innumerable activities, greater\r\nrecognition has been achieved as to the far-reaching\r\nimplications of demographic change throughout the world.\r\nThis has led to a widespread progression from a negative\r\nview of older persons as a burden to society to a more\r\npositive perception of them as active participants whose\r\nlife experience can significantly contribute to a better world.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nThe Republic of Croatia has also experienced a\r\nsignificant increase in older persons. According to the 1991\r\ncensus, over 13 per cent of the population of Croatia was\r\nolder than 60 years of age. However, as distinguished from\r\nother countries in which similar demographic trends were\r\nidentified, Croatia faced this trend under specific conditions\r\nof economic transition complicated by the impact of war.\r\nIn addressing this challenge, a wide range of activities\r\nhave begun nationally in observance of the Year, commencing\r\nwith the establishment of a national committee at the\r\nbeginning of 1999. In the context of commemorating the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, the national committee\r\norganized a conference focusing on the definition of goals\r\nfor the strategic development of caring for older persons in\r\nthe Republic of Croatia. A set of national principles was\r\ndrawn up reflecting the 18 United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons. These recommendations outline policy development\r\nfor older persons, including proposals for inaugurating a wide\r\narray of projects and activities.\r\nOf all the recommendations that were made by the\r\nNational Committee, I would like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to the following: the establishment of long-term\r\nmechanisms to monitor the interrelationship between aging\r\nand social and economic development; social care policies\r\nenvisaged for creating an enabling environment allowing full\r\nparticipation and integration of older persons into society,\r\nthrough the provision of quality care, including health care,\r\nand access to appropriate housing facilities; measures for rural\r\ndevelopment directed at changing the trend between\r\ndepopulation and ageing in certain areas by encouraging\r\nmulti-generation activities.\r\nThe experience of Croatia, where the elderly constitute\r\n20 per cent of the total number of displaced persons as a result\r\nof war, clearly demonstrates that special attention must be\r\npaid to the protection of elderly people, in addition to the\r\nprotection of women, children and other vulnerable groups.\r\nGiven the particular situation of Croatia, special attention\r\nhas been given to older persons who are internally displaced\r\nor returnees, to facilitate their return and to enable them to\r\nresume their independent way of life.\r\nThere is no doubt that in the twenty-first century we\r\nwill live longer. Whether the extension of our lifespan will\r\nbe accompanied by an increase or a decrease in the quality\r\nof life for all people will depend on the quality of our\r\npreparations for this fundamental demographic and social\r\nchange. It is a huge task for all of us, from the United Nations\r\nto Member States, intergovernmental organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nInvesting in human development throughout our entire\r\nlifetime and supporting age-integrated social institutions\r\nare not only good ideas; they are the prerequisites for the\r\nsociety for all ages that all of us want to be a part of in\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nMs. Arystanbekova (Kazakhstan): I have the honour\r\nto address this meeting of the General Assembly devoted\r\nto the follow-up to the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nLike many of the previous speakers, my delegation\r\nattaches great importance to this issue. In 1982 the General\r\nAssembly endorsed the International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing and subsequently the Assembly, in its resolution\r\n46/91, adopted the United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons. This was an unprecedented and important step by\r\nthe international community towards providing a broad\r\nframework for action on ageing and encouraging national\r\nGovernments to incorporate these Principles into their\r\nnational programmes. The Principles have made a significant\r\ncontribution to improving the status of older persons\r\nworldwide and to their participation in the formulation of\r\npolicies that directly affect their well-being.\r\nThe General Assembly, in order to further implement\r\nthe International Plan of Action and promote adherence to\r\nthe United Nations Principles for Older Persons, designated\r\nthe year 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nThe Secretary-General, launching the International Year\r\non 1 October 1998 at the United Nations Headquarters,\r\nemphasized the appropriateness of this event on the eve\r\nof the new millennium to facilitate mainstreaming older\r\npersons’ concerns and encourage activities within a long-term\r\nperspective.\r\nToday, the United Nations has become decisively\r\ninvolved in this area. The report of the Secretary-General\r\nprovides an in-depth analysis of what has been done by\r\nthe United Nations system and national Governments to\r\nimplement General Assembly resolution 53/109.\r\nMy delegation notes with great satisfaction the work\r\nof the United Nations programme on ageing, which has\r\nextended its exploration of the roles, opportunities and\r\ncontributions of older persons in fast-changing societies.\r\nWe consider it important that the United Nations programme\r\nis engaged in the ongoing formulation of a policy framework\r\nfor a society for all ages. For my delegation, it is also\r\nimportant that the still-evolving policy framework\r\nencompasses four aspects: the situation of older persons,\r\nlifelong individual development, multi-generational\r\nrelationships in families and communities, and the macro-\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nsocietal implications of ageing. These four facets have given\r\nrise to a proactive and positive exploration of ageing in the\r\ncontext of its influence on the socio-economic and cultural\r\nlandscape of society.\r\nFor my Government, improving the quality of life of\r\nits population, including older people, is a high priority.\r\nKazakhstan has made significant progress towards the\r\nimplementation of the action plans of the global United\r\nNations conferences through the development of a\r\nsocio-economic policy framework to foster sustainable\r\neconomic growth. One of the main tasks it faces today is to\r\ncreate a broad and reliable system of protection of the\r\nsocio-economic health of our population.\r\n“Kazakhstan 2030”, a presidential programme designed\r\nto move the country into the next millennium, formulates\r\nstrategies to stimulate population growth and to further\r\nimprove the health and well-being of all citizens. The\r\nprogramme provides for an increase in the longevity of the\r\npopulation through the promotion of healthy lifestyles which\r\nwould help to reduce preventable diseases and substance\r\nabuse.\r\nThe National Plan of Action was elaborated by my\r\nGovernment in order to achieve the objectives of the\r\nInternational Year. The Plan contained concrete measures\r\nto offer older people an opportunity to enjoy a broad range\r\nof benefits, including medical care and old-age pensions.\r\nPractically all of our regions drew up their own action\r\nprogrammes. A media campaign promoting the theme “A\r\nsociety for all ages” covered the questions of the relationship\r\nbetween an individual and society; older people’s\r\ninvolvement in social life; the maintenance of their dignity,\r\ncreativity and spirituality; and the promotion of healthy\r\nlifestyles and lifelong health improvement. The observance\r\nof the International Year of Older Persons in Kazakhstan\r\nhas undoubtedly raised the awareness of our society in terms\r\nof the involvement and integration of older people at all\r\nlevels.\r\nWe cannot speak about the issue of the elderly without\r\nreference to population ageing, a phenomenon that impacts\r\ngreatly on socio-economic policies. According to the\r\nPopulation Division of the Secretariat\u0027s Department of\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs, the part of my country\u0027s\r\npopulation aged 60 years or older will have more than\r\ndoubled by 2050. In the light of the rapid ageing of the\r\npopulation and the projected demographic shifts extending\r\ninto the next century, we strongly believe that this important\r\nissue will gain even greater significance in the coming years.\r\nWe also believe that in order to adjust our societies\r\nto a new reality, the international community will have to\r\ncomprehensively address the legal, fiscal, financial and labour\r\nimplications of ageing. In this regard, I would like to remind\r\nthe Assembly that the twenty-first special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, held this year on the overall review and\r\nappraisal of the implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nof the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, also reflected the view that the early\r\nstabilization of the world population would make a crucial\r\ncontribution to realizing the objective of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn my delegation\u0027s view, we have been able to achieve\r\nthe objective of the International Year of Older Persons\r\nin raising the awareness of the fast-changing demographic\r\npicture of older people globally and in promoting action\r\nstrategies to improve their integration into economic and\r\ncultural life. The role of the United Nations and its agencies\r\nis vital in this regard. Let us therefore jointly support them\r\nthrough our actions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
