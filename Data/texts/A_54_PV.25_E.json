(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 106 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family: follow-up to the International\r\nYear of Older Persons\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/268)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.6)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that,\r\nin a letter dated 5 October 1999 addressed to the President\r\nof the General Assembly, the Permanent Representative of\r\nItaly to the United Nations, in his capacity as Chairman of\r\nthe Group of Western European and other States for the\r\nmonth of October, requests that the Assembly hear a\r\nstatement by the observer of the Holy See at its plenary\r\nmeetings devoted to this item.\r\nTaking into account the importance attached to the\r\nissue under discussion, it is proposed that the General\r\nAssembly should take a decision on that request.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the proposal\r\nthat the Assembly hear the observer of the Holy See?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Older\r\npersons are an indispensable pillar of any society. They\r\nrepresent the history of a nation and the essence of its\r\nexperience. That experience gives rise to the rebirth of\r\npeoples and nations and to the building of civilizations,\r\nand consequently to that of human civilization as a whole.\r\nIn recognition of this, the General Assembly declared\r\n1999 the International Year of Older Persons. We praise\r\nthe work that went into the report before the Assembly in\r\ndocument A/54/268, entitled “International Year of Older\r\nPersons, 1999: activities and legacies”.\r\nHere we must stress the fact that not all societies or\r\ncommunities experience problems relating to the elderly.\r\nSuch problems can vary depending on the prevailing\r\nfamily and societal relationships in those communities,\r\nand on the cultural and religious education they provide.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has always devoted attention\r\nand interest to the elderly; it has always cared for them\r\nbecause they played a pioneering role in the establishment\r\nof modern Kuwait and in the preservation of its structure.\r\nIslam prescribes that older people must be given special\r\ncare; it commands Muslims to be gracious and kind to\r\nthem and to remove all difficulties and impediments from\r\ntheir surroundings. God Almighty has declared:\r\n\"Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but\r\nHim, and that ye be kind to parents.\" [The Holy\r\nKoran, XVIII:23]\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nThe Kuwaiti constitution provides for care for all\r\ncitizens in old age, in ill health and in disability, through\r\nthe provision of social security and health care services.\r\nA ministerial decision issued in 1998 established a supreme\r\nadvisory committee to draw up plans for visiting home care\r\nfor the elderly; that committee is responsible for\r\nsupervising the project and laying the foundations of a\r\nsuccessful policy on older persons. This important\r\naccomplishment reflects the increasing interest of the State\r\nof Kuwait in older persons; it is typical of the support we\r\nprovide for older persons and reflects their status in\r\nKuwaiti society. We provide home care for older people\r\nthrough social workers instead of placing them in homes\r\nfor the elderly; our older people receive excellent care and\r\nservices.\r\nThe care of older people is basic to Kuwaiti social\r\ncare services, which receive constant support from the\r\nState. We provide a variety of services and kinds of care.\r\nFor instance, the State provides nursing homes and day\r\ncare, including home care. In short, we provide older\r\npeople with all kinds of services, programmes and activities\r\nin their homes, making use of trained specialists. The life\r\nexpectancy of Kuwaiti citizens has increased; for women it\r\nhas reached 74, and for men 72, thanks to State services\r\nand care for the elderly.\r\nParallel with the United Nations commemoration of\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons, Kuwait established\r\na national committee to prepare for the Year. The activities\r\nof our commemoration include round-table discussions and\r\nscientific seminars on all matters relating to older persons,\r\nincluding professional, psychological, health and social\r\nissues, and leisure activities for older persons; conducting\r\na field study to collect data on cases of diseases or chronic\r\nailments in older persons in hospitals and evaluating all\r\nquestions relating to them and finding the necessary\r\nsolutions; honouring the first generation of older persons,\r\nwho contributed to the rebirth of our country; training the\r\nproviders of care to older persons in nursing homes and\r\nhospitals, with a view to improving the quality of care;\r\norganizing a mass media campaign to promote the new\r\nsystem of care for older persons, namely the mobile in-\r\nhome care services, through a comprehensive, centralized\r\nand specialized working group for the provision of care to\r\nolder persons at home in full coordination with their\r\nfamilies.\r\nThe project aims at preserving the dignity of older\r\npersons, providing care and services at home and solving\r\ntheir social and psychological problems. We provide\r\nnursing and hospital services, family guidance regarding\r\nbalanced nutrition, leisure and recreational means, and all\r\nmedical appliances and equipment needed by the elderly.\r\nAs we approach the dawn of the twenty-first century,\r\nI cannot but pay homage to the United Nations General\r\nAssembly for declaring 1999 the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons, with the theme “A society for all ages”,\r\nsince at the beginning of 2002, older persons will\r\nconstitute 25 per cent of the total population of the\r\ndeveloping countries, which will have a profound effect\r\non their social and economic development.\r\nMr. Chandraprasert (Thailand): It is an honour and\r\na pleasure for me to participate in this plenary meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly to give a brief report on Thailand\u0027s\r\nobservance of the International Year of Older Persons. I\r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to express my\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his report on\r\n“International Year of Older Persons, 1999: activities and\r\nlegacies”, which highlights the achievements made during\r\nthis important Year in promoting the welfare of older\r\npersons.\r\nIn Thailand, those who are 60 years old or over are\r\nregarded as older persons. Today older persons make up\r\nabout 8.9 per cent of our population, or 5.5 million\r\nindividuals. It is estimated that within the next decade,\r\nthis figure will increase to between 7 million and 8\r\nmillion as a result of significant progress in health care\r\nand medical technology.\r\nThe problems facing Thailand\u0027s older persons are\r\nwide-ranging. Whether in the areas of health, income,\r\nhousing or accessibility to social services, these problems\r\nhave a strong impact on older persons and pose\r\nsignificant challenges to society in dealing with them. The\r\nsituation has been compounded by the transformation of\r\nthe family unit in past decades, from the extended family\r\nto the nuclear family, which has further increased the\r\ndemands on government to take care of older persons.\r\nHow are the challenges being met? Fortunately for\r\nThailand, older persons are highly revered in our society.\r\nOur traditional culture encourages young people to respect\r\nand care for older persons. This traditional culture goes\r\nsome way towards alleviating the problems faced by older\r\npersons.\r\nFurthermore, the Government and non-governmental\r\norganizations have implemented preventive and protective\r\nprogrammes for older persons, in accordance with the\r\nguidelines of the World Assembly on Ageing, convened\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nin Vienna in 1982. The National Committee on the Elderly\r\nwas appointed in 1982, and in the same year, 13 April of\r\neach year was declared National Ageing Day. The\r\nGovernment has also encouraged every province throughout\r\nthe country to establish a club for the elderly where older\r\npersons can come together to organize activities for\r\nthemselves and society at large. At present, there are more\r\nthan 3,000 older persons\u0027 clubs in Thailand. In 1989 these\r\nclubs agreed to set up the Senior Citizens Council of\r\nThailand, which acts as the coordinating body of all\r\nassociations and clubs for older persons, including\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations, within\r\nthe country.\r\nPolicies to support the elderly are integrated into the\r\nnational policy. They are in line with three national master\r\nplans, namely, the Eighth National Economic and Social\r\nDevelopment Plan (1997-2001), the National Long-Term\r\nPolicies and Measures on Older Persons (1992-2011) and\r\nthe Third National Social Welfare and Social Work\r\nDevelopment Plan (1997-2001). On the basis of these three\r\nnational master plans, the Government will undertake the\r\nfollowing to help foster the well-being of older persons:\r\npromoting health care knowledge, expanding basic social\r\nservices, encouraging the transfer of experience from older\r\nto younger persons, promoting the value of reciprocal\r\nfamily obligation, supporting preferred religious and moral\r\nvalues, subsidizing service provision by communities and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, increasing the training of\r\nservice providers for older persons and promoting data\r\ncompilation, research and project evaluation.\r\nIn observance of the 1999 International Year of Older\r\nPersons, the Department of Public Welfare, under the\r\nMinistry of Labour and Social Welfare, has been designated\r\nthe national focal point to arrange activities to celebrate the\r\nYear. In organizing activities to mark this event, we have\r\nadhered to our belief in the principle that older persons are\r\nboth contributors to and recipients of benefits from society,\r\na principle widely recognized by the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOn this basis, the National Committee on the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, chaired by Mr. Chuan\r\nLeekpai, Prime Minister of Thailand, has launched a\r\nprogramme of activities nationwide with the participation of\r\nthe Government, non-governmental organizations, the\r\nprivate sector and, most importantly, older persons. The\r\nfollowing activities are some of the highlights of the\r\nprogramme.\r\nFirst, the Government launched Thailand\u0027s\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons at the Government\r\nHouse, chaired by the Prime Minister, before the week of\r\nNational Ageing Day and National Family Day.\r\nSecondly, the Declaration on Thailand\u0027s Older\r\nPersons was adopted by the Government, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and public and social\r\ninstitutions to affirm commitments and obligations to\r\nbetter the quality of life and to promote and protect the\r\nrights of older persons.\r\nThirdly, the Government has set up the National\r\nCoordinating Body on Older Persons, under the Office of\r\nthe Prime Minister, to be responsible for formulating\r\npolicies and strategies and promoting continued and\r\nefficient coordination of affairs relating to older persons\r\namong concerned agencies.\r\nFourthly, forums of older persons have been\r\narranged nationwide in the four regions for older persons\r\nto share their opinions on and attitudes towards social\r\nissues. These views serve as valuable inputs for the\r\nformulation of plans and policies for older persons in the\r\nfuture.\r\nIn Thailand religious institutions have played and\r\ncontinue to play an important role in moulding the Thai\r\npeople’s way of life and shaping attitudes towards\r\ncompassion. Therefore, the Thai Government has been\r\nencouraging people in the community to set up citizens’\r\norganizations to manage social service centres for older\r\npersons in the community’s temples throughout the\r\ncountry. These centres should act as the central\r\nimplementing mechanisms in local areas for social\r\nservices for older persons, as places where all older\r\npersons would be able to get the appropriate services\r\nfrom Government and non-governmental organizations.\r\nActivities organized by such community-based centres\r\nwould benefit people of all ages in the community as\r\nwell.\r\nIn organizing the celebration in Thailand of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, we found to our\r\npleasure that Thai people and various organizations are\r\npaying more attention to older persons, and they joined in\r\nactivities organized both in Bangkok and in regional\r\nareas. People of all ages recognize the importance of\r\nolder persons and are paying them more respect and\r\ncaring for them. Older persons themselves have shown\r\ntheir capabilities as contributors to society by passing on\r\ntheir experience to the younger generations.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nTo build on this momentum, the Government of\r\nThailand has formulated the following policy guidelines to\r\nassist older persons in the future. First, non-governmental\r\norganizations, foundations, associations and civil society are\r\nto be supported and encouraged to help older persons by\r\nextending access to services in rural areas. Second, as soon\r\nas possible an older person’s law is to be enacted. Third,\r\ncommunities and societies are to be encouraged to\r\nrecognize the problems of older persons. Fourth, the\r\nawareness of families and communities about how to care\r\nfor older persons is to be increased by emphasizing\r\nrelationships and mutual support among extended family\r\nmembers. Fifth, the coordinating mechanisms on ageing are\r\nto be strengthened. Sixth, a second long-term plan for older\r\npersons is to be formulated. Seventh, research studies on\r\nthe elderly are to be encouraged. Eight, access to social\r\nservices for older persons nationwide is to be provided by\r\ndispatching mobile units to reach older persons in\r\ncommunities and rural areas.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure all members of\r\nthe Assembly that Thailand’s national economic and social\r\ndevelopment plan and the policy guidelines of organizations\r\nconcerned will provide continued support for and attach\r\nhigh priority to the family institution, of which older\r\npersons are indeed valuable and useful assets. After all,\r\nolder persons are not only the link to our past, the\r\nembodiment of our living cultural heritage, but are indeed\r\nalso the repository of the collective wisdom from which our\r\nsociety draws as we make important decisions about our\r\npresent and future.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): The International Year of\r\nOlder Persons comes at a time when we are witnessing a\r\ncontinuous increase in older persons as a proportion of the\r\ntotal population. In absolute terms, the number of older\r\npersons is increasing by a million per year. The world is\r\nactually seeing itself greying, demographically speaking.\r\nThis enormous growth will continue well into the\r\ntwenty-first century. Statistics show that in a few\r\ngenerations average life expectancy could rise by another\r\n20 years. So the population of the world is ageing.\r\nPolitical developments, industrialization and advanced\r\ntechnologies have brought immense benefits to most of\r\nhumanity — but not to all. It should, therefore, be our\r\ncommon goal to build a community for all generations. The\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons has provided an\r\nopportunity for Government decision-makers, researchers,\r\npractitioners, non-governmental organizations, community\r\nassociations and the public at large to focus specifically\r\non the status of older persons.\r\nDuring this year, as we see from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/54/268), Governments have taken\r\nnoticeable practical steps to improve the living conditions\r\nof the elderly. Now we have an opportunity to make a\r\nbrief review of the progress that has been made in this\r\narea. The exchange of information and experience at the\r\ninternational level can effectively promote the elaboration\r\nof further long-term initiatives and strategies on ageing.\r\nIn this context, our delegation welcomes the\r\nextensive work done in this sphere by the United Nations\r\nprogramme on ageing and, in particular, by its director,\r\nthe Coordinator of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, Alexandre Sidorenko, our countryman. We hope\r\nthat this team will successfully continue its useful work.\r\nLet me now touch briefly on the situation in\r\nUkraine. Like many other countries, Ukraine is\r\nexperiencing the rapid ageing of its population. The\r\ncurrent demographic situation is characterized by an\r\nincrease in the number of people aged over 60. In 1960\r\nthey amounted to 13.8 per cent of the total population of\r\nUkraine; by 1996 this figure had reached 18.6 per cent.\r\nBy 2015 we expect it to reach 22 per cent. This process\r\ncauses difficulties connected with general problems of our\r\ncountry’s economic development: labour resources; the\r\nstructure of medical, social and other services; financial\r\nsupport for older persons; their status in the family and\r\nsociety; the interrelationship between generations; and so\r\nforth.\r\nIn order to solve these problems the Government of\r\nUkraine has taken practical steps aimed at promoting\r\nolder people’s lifelong development and well-being by\r\nlaunching comprehensive national programmes of actions\r\nto be carried out during the International Year of Older\r\nPersons and afterwards. These programmes combine the\r\nefforts of governmental agencies, non-governmental\r\norganizations, non-profit organizations and academic\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIn practical terms, we have increased pension\r\nbenefits and started pension-insurance reforms. The\r\nnational programme to eradicate poverty among the\r\nelderly has become an important instrument in bringing\r\nthe income level of the elderly closer to the national\r\naverage, which is being done by means of increased\r\nspecial and regular benefits.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nUnder the national programme to promote the health\r\nof elderly people, the Government of Ukraine has\r\nstrengthened existing institutions and established new ones,\r\nthereby providing improved medical assistance to these\r\npersons. The programme is also intended to provide the\r\nelderly with the maximum possible social benefits;\r\nencourage increased productivity, improve service quality\r\nand guarantee distribution of rehabilitation resources and\r\nother goods; and improve existing attitudes with regard to\r\nthe elderly. The Government has provided the elderly with\r\nfree and unrestricted access to medical assistance, and\r\ncontinues to enact legislation granting them health care\r\nprivileges. The programme facilitated the improvement of\r\nthe coordination of the activities of central and local state\r\nauthorities, as well as those of enterprises, organizations\r\nand unions dealing with different aspects of the problem of\r\nthe elderly.\r\nAmong other measures, the Government and local\r\nauthorities have established policies that promote the\r\nproduction of food and other necessities for the elderly. In\r\naddition, the Government of Ukraine provides special social\r\nservices for the elderly, with a particular focus on the\r\ndisabled.\r\nIn Ukraine the problem of the elderly is also viewed\r\nfrom the gender perspective. In this connection, I would\r\nlike to point out an important feature that has developed in\r\nour country over the last decade. In Ukraine the difference\r\nbetween the average lifespan of men and women has\r\nsubstantially increased, to the point where the average\r\nlifespan of women is now about 12 years longer. Hence,\r\nthe ratio of older women is steadily growing. At the same\r\ntime, statistics show that women are poorer than men in old\r\nage and more often need extra medical attention.\r\nWithout going deep into the underlying causes of this\r\nphenomenon, it is worth mentioning that this circumstance\r\nprompted our Government to undertake a number of extra\r\nmeasures in order to adjust the system of health care and\r\nmedical services for the elderly, as well as the work of\r\nnumerous social institutions, to meet the needs of the\r\nincreasing number of women among the elderly. While this\r\nadjustment process is still in progress, it is now clear that\r\nit requires additional funds and resources, which are in\r\ndeficit in a country with its economy in transition.\r\nNevertheless, we will continue to take steps aimed at\r\nfinding an effective solution to this problem.\r\nRecent developments in our demographic situation\r\nhave raised fundamental questions regarding an adequate\r\npolicy towards older persons and highlighted the need for\r\nnew approaches in this domain. Of course, the provision\r\nof social security and similar conventional services and\r\nbenefits is of great importance. At the same time, it\r\nwould not, perhaps, suffice to change the situation for the\r\nbetter in any important way.\r\nWe must therefore continue both the provision of\r\ncare and income security and the pursuit of strategies to\r\nprotect the rights of this group of people. In doing so, we\r\nshould take decisive action in order to move towards a\r\nsociety of policies focused on self-help and independence\r\nof the elderly, in which they would become active\r\nmembers of society.\r\nIn this regard, Ukraine welcomes the series of\r\nimportant initiatives of the United Nations Secretariat to\r\nsupport the development of the long-term perspective\r\nstrategy on ageing, including convening in the year 2002\r\na conference to review the outcome of the World\r\nAssembly on Ageing. We also support the proposal to\r\nrevise the 20-year old Vienna International Plan of Action\r\non Ageing, to adapt it to the changing conditions and\r\nadjust it to meet new challenges. We hope that adequate\r\nresources will also be provided for this purpose.\r\nOld age is the future of us all and by creating new\r\nopportunities for the elderly and more favourable\r\nconditions of life for the aged, we are thinking first of all\r\nof ourselves. The rhetorical question written almost two\r\ncenturies ago by the famous English poet George Lord\r\nByron — “What is the worst of woes that wait on\r\nAge?” — should be left in the past.\r\nMr. Balanandan (India): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my delegation\u0027s appreciation for the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the activities of the International\r\nYear of Older Persons. We are particularly pleased at the\r\nscientific approach taken for the further follow-up of\r\nissues related to ageing. We thank the Government of\r\nSpain for its offer to host a second world assembly on\r\nageing in 2002.\r\nWe believe that ageing should not be looked upon as\r\na problem that societies must face. We need not be\r\nalarmed by the process of what is termed the “greying”\r\nof societies. This is a natural phenomenon which calls for\r\nsocietal adjustments and reorientation in which everybody\r\ncan contribute productively for the ultimate benefit of\r\nmankind. I would venture to say that, more than a society\r\nfor all ages, what we need to work for is an\r\nencompassing society for all mankind in which the young\r\nand the old, the strong and the weak, the able and the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\ndisabled, the child and the parent each obtain equal\r\nopportunities for productive contribution, enhanced human\r\nrelations and fulfilment of aspirations.\r\nWe do not believe in the stereotype of age. We do not\r\nbelieve that a human being is antique when old and a\r\nnovelty when young. The eminent philosopher and second\r\nPresident of India, Mr. S. Radhakrishnan, said:\r\n“We do not grow old by living a certain number of\r\nyears. We grow old if we lose our ideals, if we\r\nbecome immune to change. Years may wrinkle the\r\nskin; the soul is wrinkled if we give up love and\r\nloyalty. Whether we are 20 or 70, we are young as\r\nlong as we have in our heart the spirit of wonder, of\r\ncuriosity, the challenge to life and the joy of\r\nadventure.”\r\nMy country\u0027s view of age is therefore based not on a\r\nnumerical addition of years, but on an integrated process of\r\nlearning through experience. This has been enunciated in\r\nour civilization through two composites: knowledge and\r\nabilities. Constant improvement in both leads to a\r\nproductive compact called jeevana — life which is neither\r\nyoung nor old but a continuum of actions. In our\r\nphilosophy we do not go by the years of survival, but by\r\nour contribution — by whether what we have done survives\r\nafter us. We do not segment by the hourglass; we do not\r\nfragment life into years. It is this life-oriented view of age\r\nthat prompts us to look at plans and programmes for the\r\nelderly as an integrated whole in which lifelong individual\r\ndevelopment is fostered.\r\nWhile this view of society has influenced all our\r\ndevelopment activities, a stronger integration of age in our\r\npolicies was introduced in the early 1990s through a\r\nnumber of affirmative actions. We started a scheme in 1992\r\nto promote the welfare of the aged through a nationwide\r\nnetwork of non-governmental organizations. The\r\nGovernment provides direct financial assistance to non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and other voluntary\r\norganizations to set up and run day-care centres, old age\r\nhomes, mobile medicare and non-institutional services.\r\nThese services are rendered to pensioners and to persons\r\nabove 60 years who are from the non-formal sector. Ninety\r\nper cent of the expenditures borne by the non-governmental\r\norganizations come from government grants and the balance\r\nis raised through contributions and donations. In tribal\r\nareas, the Government grant is 95 per cent. Voluntary\r\norganizations financed by the Government appoint social\r\nworkers to help the elderly in legal, banking and tax\r\nmatters. In addition, they are helped to get access to special\r\nmedical facilities. Between 1992 and 1998, the\r\nGovernment of India spent an equivalent of $10 million\r\non this scheme.\r\nIn 1997, we also embarked upon a scheme through\r\nthe grass-roots administrative system of the village\r\ncouncils, aiming to establish at least one old-age home\r\nper district throughout the country. To assist in their\r\nconstruction, the Government has been granting an\r\nequivalent of $12,000 for each unit. We do realize,\r\nhowever, that much more needs to be done and are\r\nformulating a national policy for older persons, which\r\nshould be completed soon.\r\nWhatever we do at the “macro” level of policies to\r\nimprove the life of the individual, such policies are rooted\r\nin and grow from the value systems of each society. The\r\nlast 200 years have seen the release of vast productive\r\ncapacities, bringing with them great changes in social\r\nmores and values. In particular, rural-urban displacements\r\nhave helped bring down the old order of family values\r\nand replace it with a society oriented to self and not\r\ncommunity. But, as we move into the next century and a\r\nnew millennium — when, according to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report (A/54/268), one in every five persons in\r\nthe world will be an older person — let us consciously\r\nreorient our thinking of life: one integrated whole, not\r\nage-denominated partitions. Productive endeavours at later\r\nstages in life, greater interpersonal co-relations through\r\nnew communication technologies, a better and greener\r\nenvironment, greater freedom to travel and see other\r\ncivilizations — all those will make life richer and worth\r\nliving.\r\nMs. Viken (Norway): The International Year of\r\nOlder Persons 1999 has been warmly welcomed both by\r\nthe Norwegian Government and by the Norwegian non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. The International Year, on\r\nthe eve of the millennium, has been a significant event\r\nfor demonstrating the importance of older peoples\u0027\r\ncontribution to and potential in our societies and the\r\nbenefits of active and healthy ageing.\r\nHow Norway has marked the Year has been\r\ncoordinated by a national committee, with members from\r\nthe Government and from the non-governmental\r\norganization sector. The chairman is the Minister of\r\nSocial Affairs. The main focus has been on the situation\r\nof older persons, lifelong learning and solidarity between\r\ngenerations. Cooperation with the Baltic States and north-\r\nwest Russia and the situation of older persons there have\r\nalso been priority issues.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nThe Norwegian Government highlighted the\r\ninternational dimension of the International Year by hosting\r\na conference in Oslo on participation by older persons. The\r\nconference drew participants from the Nordic countries, the\r\nBaltic countries, Russia and the European Commission, and\r\nalso from many European non-governmental organizations.\r\nTwo elements played a central role in this seminar: senior-\r\ncitizen councils and voluntary work. I believe that both\r\nelements can be key factors in increasing participation by\r\nolder persons.\r\nThe main ambition of the Norwegian national\r\ncommittee, however, has been to stimulate activities at\r\nregional and local levels in my country. Grants have been\r\nmade available for innovative, inter-organizational projects.\r\nThe partner non-governmental organizations in the\r\nInternational Year have made substantial efforts to stimulate\r\nactivities for and with older persons. Among the most\r\nsuccessful projects in terms of creating solidarity between\r\ngenerations is cooperation between schools and activity\r\ncentres for older persons on information technology. One of\r\nthe main national events that took place during the Year has\r\nbeen an “older people\u0027s week”, which included a broad\r\nrange of activities by and for older persons. The Year was\r\nbrought to a successful end at a televised gala performance\r\non 1 October. Her Majesty the Queen, the Prime Minister,\r\nthe Minister of Social Affairs and 900 people from all over\r\nNorway attended the performance.\r\nThe main challenge now is to follow up the attention\r\nand ambitions created by the International Year. Our focus\r\non this issue should remain in line with the 1991 United\r\nNations Principles for Older Persons (General Assembly\r\nresolution 46/91, annex). Older persons should remain\r\nintegrated within society, be perceived as a resource,\r\nparticipate actively in the formulation and implementation\r\nof policies that affect their well-being and share their\r\nknowledge and skills with younger generations. Being old\r\ndoes not necessarily mean being sick and helpless, as the\r\nNorwegian sociologist, Professor Gunhild Hagestad, pointed\r\nout in her keynote address at the launching of the\r\nInternational Year here at the United Nations on 1 October\r\nlast year; the promotion of active ageing should be a\r\ncornerstone of our future efforts.\r\nLet me say a few words about the challenges we face\r\nin Norway. The most important task will be to increase our\r\ncapacity for providing care for frail older persons. The\r\nNorwegian Government has embarked on an ambitious\r\nfour-year plan to improve the care of older persons. The\r\ncore objectives of the plan are to provide nursing and care\r\nservices which ensure that the elderly live secure, worthy\r\nand independent lives, to ensure that elderly persons can\r\nlive in their own homes or in sheltered housing for as\r\nlong as possible, and to provide sufficient capacity to\r\nensure that services are available when and where needed.\r\nThe tight labour market in Norway and the\r\ndemographic developments ahead make it necessary to\r\nprevent too early retirement from the labour force. To the\r\nbenefit of retired persons, the Norwegian Government has\r\nrecently implemented a significant increase in the\r\nminimum pension.\r\nNorway strongly supports the increased participation\r\nof the United Nations system in ageing-related events and\r\nresearch. We welcome the attention of both the\r\nCommission for Social Development and the Commission\r\non the Status of Women to the issues of the social\r\nintegration and participation of older persons. The special\r\nsessions of the General Assembly next year in connection\r\nwith the World Summit for Social Development and the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women will surely expand\r\non these efforts. Furthermore, the activities of the United\r\nNations funds and programmes in the ageing and\r\ndevelopment area are proving instrumental in the follow-\r\nup to the International Year. In its development\r\ncooperation work, Norway gives high priority to the\r\nsocial sector, including support for basic health services.\r\nPrimary health care targets vulnerable groups, including\r\nolder persons.\r\nI feel confident that we can all learn from each other\r\nin the follow-up to the International Year. I also feel\r\nconfident that the United Nations will remain a useful\r\nplatform in this respect, as well as in connection with the\r\nInternational Year of Volunteers in 2001.\r\nWe must all make an effort to be prepared for the\r\nnew millennium with policies and solutions capable of\r\nfulfilling the objectives of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons. We all have a responsibility to contribute to the\r\ncreation of a genuine society for all ages in all countries.\r\nMrs. Aponte de Zacklin (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Venezuela fully supports the statement made on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and is pleased to\r\njoin in the expressions of gratitude to Ambassador Julia\r\nTavares de Alvarez for her extraordinary contribution to\r\npolicies benefiting older persons.\r\nVenezuela is also very pleased to participate in the\r\ncommemoration of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, with the theme “Towards a society for all ages”.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nThe great international interest in the question of\r\nageing is clearly shown by the activities which have been\r\ncarried out to attain the objective of creating “a society for\r\nall ages”, a society that, as the Secretary-General has said,\r\ndoes not characterize the elderly as pensioners, but regards\r\nthem as both agents and beneficiaries of development.\r\nIn the final decades of the twentieth century the “silent\r\nrevolution” began — in other words, the rapid ageing of the\r\npopulation and the uncontrollable demographic changes that\r\nwill extend into the next millennium. Although ageing is a\r\nglobal phenomenon, its rate of increase has been faster in\r\ndeveloping countries. In Latin America and the Caribbean,\r\ndemographic statistics from the Caribbean centre with\r\nresponsibility in that field indicate that the proportion of\r\nthose over 60 in the population increased from 6 per cent\r\nto 7.9 per cent in the last decade, and will rise again over\r\nthe next 25 years, to 14 per cent.\r\nAnother significant fact, according to Martha Peláez,\r\nregional adviser on ageing and health of the Pan American\r\nHealth Organization, is that in countries throughout the\r\nworld, ageing is above all a question of gender, and the\r\nLatin America and Caribbean region is no exception.\r\nHowever, in this region the situation is characterized by\r\nwidespread levels of poverty that make women more\r\nvulnerable as a result, inter alia, of their greater inability to\r\nacquire economic resources. Thus, it is important that\r\npolicies designed to deal with questions of the ageing of the\r\npopulation at the global level take into account the specific\r\nneeds of women, but it is important also to make sure that\r\nthe policies adopted for developing countries be very\r\ndifferent from those which are appropriate in developed\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Government of Venezuela, through its long-term\r\nprogramme, the Bolivar Plan 2000 and the Economic\r\nTransition Programme 1999-2000, is consolidating the\r\nconditions for an economy favouring social justice and thus\r\nbenefiting all social groups. To commemorate the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, Venezuela\u0027s National\r\nInstitute of Geriatrics and Gerontology (INAGER), our\r\nmain body dealing with older persons, held a programme of\r\nactivities. These included the first days for the\r\nmodernization of geriatric therapy, for more than a hundred\r\ndoctors working in geriatric and gerontological units of\r\nINAGER, held in Caracas from 30 September to 2 October.\r\nI would also like to mention the Week of Older Persons,\r\narranged in cooperation with the country\u0027s most important\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nWithin the framework of social action, coordinated\r\nefforts are being made by the Government and civil\r\nsociety to achieve the common well-being of all members\r\nof Venezuelan society. In this connection, and in\r\nconnection with the goals related to dealing with older\r\npersons in the family, the basic unit of social\r\norganization, we feel it relevant to mention the ideas\r\nexpressed by the First Lady of the Republic in her\r\nstatement at the United Nations to commemorate the\r\nInternational Day of Families, which included the need to\r\nstrengthen families through promoting the repositioning of\r\nthe family as an instrument for improving the world and\r\nlife.\r\nAnother idea was that the unity of children, adults\r\nand the elderly, irrespective of the connections and the\r\ncharacteristics of the home that bring them together, has\r\na potential that is not always seen by social action\r\norganizations and their methods and that this comes\r\nwithin the concept of “a society for all ages”.\r\nAgeing, seen overall, is in its individual dimension\r\na life-long process. Efforts to achieve the social,\r\neconomic and spiritual well-being of members of society\r\nof advanced ages are therefore the concern of everyone\r\nand attaining this objective benefits all humanity.\r\nThe celebration of the International Year has thus\r\nenabled us to think not only about the dialogue between\r\ngenerations in the conceptual framework of “a society for\r\nall ages”, but also about people\u0027s necessary, in-depth,\r\nintimate and sincere internal dialogue.\r\nIn conclusion, human beings have always hoped to\r\nprolong their lives, and this hope has been accompanied\r\nby the illusion of eternal youth. These desires are not\r\nmutually exclusive, but complementary. We will be\r\neternally young in our hearts if we live with dignity until\r\nthe end of our days, if we feel useful to society and, in\r\nparticular, if we can share our individual, unique, singular\r\nexperience — experience which, however, we have\r\ngained from that great universal book entitled “Life”.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein): The adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing in December 1982 marked the beginning of a new\r\nawareness about the ageing process from birth throughout\r\nthe life cycle. Since then the questions of promoting\r\nactive ageing, as well as ensuring fuller participation and\r\nbetter quality of care in old age, have gradually been\r\nintroduced to the agenda of several United Nations bodies\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nand agencies, culminating in the declaration of 1999 as the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons.\r\nIt is of particular relevance to recognize that the\r\nlongevity revolution is changing the concept of ageing.\r\nOver past years, the world\u0027s population has continually\r\nmoved from a state of high birth and death rates to one\r\ncharacterized by low birth and death rates. The number and\r\nproportion of older persons has increased at an\r\nunprecedented rate. While in 1950 the number of persons\r\naged 60 or older was 200 million, it is today almost 550\r\nmillion, and in about the year 2020, the world\u0027s ageing\r\npopulation will reach 1 billion. It is also expected that the\r\nmajor increase in the world\u0027s older persons will occur in the\r\nless-developed countries and that women will continue to\r\nmake up the majority of older persons all over the world.\r\nExtended longevity, which, along with declining\r\nfertility, is the universal cause of population ageing, affects\r\nboth society and individuals. There are many implications\r\nfor society, including patterns of production, labour market\r\nconditions and services required. However, the negative\r\naspects of ageing, such as the increased costs of providing\r\nsocial services and benefits, are often emphasized, while the\r\nvaluable contribution that older persons can make to society\r\nis ignored.\r\nWhile the majority of older persons continues to lead\r\nhealthy and productive lives, the risk of dependency grows\r\nwith increasing age. Traditional support systems for older\r\npersons are challenged today. Due to demographic\r\ndevelopment, the ratio between older persons and available\r\nyounger family caregivers is declining and traditional\r\nfamily support patterns are eroding. It remains therefore the\r\nresponsibility of Governments to design policies to provide\r\ncare for dependent older persons and to support those who\r\nprovide such care.\r\nIn this context it is important to note that women\u0027s\r\nincreased participation in the labour force will inevitably\r\nlead to conflicting demands on women who face the double\r\nand triple burden of child care, elder care and personal\r\ncareer. The workplace is therefore a critical site for\r\nproviding assistance to employees who are also caregivers.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\ncontained in document A/54/268, which highlights some of\r\nthe activities undertaken on the national level as well as by\r\nnon-governmental organizations and within the United\r\nNations system. I would like to point out some of the\r\npromotional and outreach activities which have taken place\r\nor will still take place within the programme for observing\r\nand celebrating the International Year of Older Persons in\r\nLiechtenstein.\r\nThe National Contact and Advisory Committee on\r\nAgeing initiated the “Platform for generations”, which\r\nserves as a multigenerational forum to exchange views on\r\nhow to achieve a good quality of life regardless of age.\r\nThe national Association of Older Persons, in cooperation\r\nwith the national police and a private security company,\r\npublished a brochure designed to make older persons\r\naware of risks and dangers in daily life and to advise\r\nthem on preventive measures. The national radio\r\nbroadcast a programme series between June and\r\nSeptember of this year on questions of ageing. The\r\nNational Contact and Advisory Committee on Ageing is\r\noffering courses for people who wish to serve as\r\ncommunicators in a bridging function between\r\ngenerations. In January 2000, an expert meeting will\r\ndiscuss problems of ageing, and participants will include\r\nolder persons themselves, national care institutions and\r\npoliticians.\r\nWe look back on a century during which people\u0027s\r\nlife expectancy increased dramatically and age structures\r\nof societies underwent profound changes. These\r\ndevelopments will extend into the coming century and\r\nwill require further action. We express our hope that “A\r\nsociety for all ages” will become a social reality soon.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank in particular\r\nAmbassador Julia Alvarez for her valuable contributions\r\nin transforming the idea of an International Year of Older\r\nPersons into reality, as well as Mr. Aurelio Fernández,\r\nCounsellor for Social Affairs at the Permanent Mission of\r\nSpain, for his work.\r\nMr. Ingólfsson (Iceland): We welcome the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on this important issue, which we\r\nthink yields important information for Member States, and\r\nwe concur with its findings.\r\nIcelandic authorities have done their utmost to\r\nenhance the visibility of the issues facing the elderly in\r\ntoday\u0027s society. An executive committee for the Year of\r\nthe Elderly was established in Iceland for this purpose, as\r\nwell as to plan events and projects. The focus of the\r\ncommittee\u0027s work was on four main aspects relating to the\r\nelderly: education, economic matters, social affairs and\r\nhealth.\r\nOne of the projects was to have a study made on the\r\nstandard of living and way of life of senior citizens in\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nIceland including, as far as possible, comparisons with\r\nother age groups and other countries. The study was based\r\non data collected during the period 1988 to 1999.\r\nAccording to the study, poverty has diminished\r\nconsiderably among senior citizens in Iceland during the\r\nlast ten years. Looking at the senior citizens\u0027 way of life, it\r\nis evident that in Iceland this group is very active in the\r\nlabour market and in society in general, compared to\r\nneighbouring countries. Senior citizens\u0027 participation in the\r\nlabour market in Iceland is indeed exceptionally high\r\ncompared to that of other Western societies, indicating that\r\nthis group is still taking a very active part in society.\r\nSenior citizens follow the mass media, radio and\r\ntelevision news programmes, for example, more than\r\nyounger people. They also read newspapers to a greater\r\nextent. They are active in community life and engage in a\r\nvariety of leisure activities, which is important to prevent\r\nexclusion from society.\r\nSenior citizens have a decidedly different outlook on\r\nlife than younger people. They tend more towards religious\r\nobservance and are more religious in general. They place\r\nmore importance on social welfare, have a more positive\r\nattitude towards work, are more loyal to employers and\r\nhave a stronger sense of morality than younger generations.\r\nThe conclusions of the study will be used as a basis\r\nfor future policy-making in matters relating to the elderly.\r\nFinally, we concur with the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nrecommendations that Governments should expand their\r\napproaches to individual ageing, complementing care and\r\nsecurity for older persons with measures that promote\r\nactive participation of the elderly in society.\r\nMrs. Brobbey (Ghana): The Ghana delegation are\r\nhonoured to address the General Assembly and to associate\r\nourselves with the statement on the follow-up to the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons made by the\r\nrepresentative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77.\r\nThe United Nations World Assembly on Ageing, held\r\nin Vienna in 1982, brought into sharp focus the ageing of\r\nthe world\u0027s population, with its attendant challenges to\r\nsociety. The ageing of the world\u0027s population is so rapid\r\nthat today the population aged 60 years or older is\r\nestimated to be nearly 600 million, and it is projected to\r\ngrow to almost 2 billion by the year 2050, when the\r\npopulation of older persons will be larger than the\r\npopulation of children. However, the increase will be more\r\ndramatic in the developing world, where the population\r\naged 60 years or over will grow from 350 million in 1998\r\nto almost 1.6 billion in 2050.\r\nBecause of that development, Ghana welcomed the\r\nGeneral Assembly\u0027s decision in 1992 to observe the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons in 1999, and the\r\nsubsequent launching of the Year on 1 October 1998 by\r\nthe Secretary-General with the theme “A society for all\r\nages”. The appropriateness of this theme cannot be\r\noveremphasized, given the tendency to neglect the aged\r\nand relegate their needs and aspirations to the\r\nbackground, even in societies like ours, where the aged\r\nare regarded as repositories of wisdom.\r\nMigration from the rural areas, where the greater\r\nproportion of the aged live, has adversely affected the\r\npatterns of social interaction and relationships within the\r\ntraditional family system in Ghana. Consequently, older\r\npersons in Ghana are showing signs of loneliness and\r\nneglect. We are therefore convinced that a society that\r\ncaters for all ages, as envisaged by the international\r\ncommunity, would indeed tailor its structures, policies and\r\nplans to meet the needs and capabilities of all, thereby\r\nreleasing the potential of all, including the aged, for the\r\nbenefit of all.\r\nIn pursuance of this goal, the Government of Ghana\r\nhas drafted a national policy on ageing which aims at\r\npromoting the social integration of older persons in order\r\nto enable them to participate fully in society. Within this\r\ncontext, the Government is committed to the eradication\r\nof poverty among older persons and their families through\r\nthe provision of income-generation and job-creation\r\nactivities such as the employment of older persons in the\r\nteaching of skill development programmes in crafts like\r\npottery and weaving. Income-generating projects targeted\r\nat women include employing active older women as\r\nchildcare providers in daycare centres for children. This\r\npolicy is designed to differ from conventional\r\narrangements, where the focus is on providing care to\r\nolder persons, in order to give the latter an opportunity of\r\nactive involvement in productive social life. It is an\r\nimportant tool to foster intergenerational relationships.\r\nThe Government, in collaboration with Help Age\r\nGhana, a non-governmental organization, has established\r\nthe first daycare centre for older persons and plans to\r\nopen more centres to share the responsibility for the care\r\nof older family members. This policy would encourage\r\ncontinued family support while relieving the family of\r\nsome of the burdens of caring for the aged.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nThe Government is also considering substantive tax\r\nbreaks and subsidies for the support of older persons. This\r\npolicy is intended to give concessions, relief and\r\nencouragement to family members who live and care for\r\nthe older members of their families, and also to preserve\r\nthe traditional formal system of social welfare and support,\r\nas well as intergenerational relationships. We are, however,\r\naware that a durable solution to the poverty that plagues the\r\naged in our society is to reform our social security system\r\nby broadening its scope to take care of the huge percentage\r\nof the population in the informal sector, such as petty\r\ntraders, fishermen and farmers. In this connection, we have\r\nincluded in our policy a lifelong development programme\r\nfor a better livelihood in the latter stages of the\r\nindividuals\u0027s life. The policy seeks to promote lifelong\r\nlearning and healthy lifestyles, which, if properly\r\nimplemented, would offer the youth of today security,\r\nautonomy and protection in their old age.\r\nAs part of the celebration of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons, the Government launched the Year in March\r\nwith education campaigns throughout the country to raise\r\nawareness of the plight of the aged in our society. A\r\nprogramme of interaction between young people and the\r\naged has been put in place by the Government and Help\r\nAge Ghana. Schoolchildren visit the aged in their\r\ncommunities on Sundays to either learn from them or help\r\nthem with their house chores. The Government now offers\r\nfree medical services to the aged.\r\nThe Republic Day of Ghana was declared “Senior\r\nCitizens Day”, with durbars and receptions held in honour\r\nof all senior citizens. In this vein, President Jerry Rawlings\r\nhosted some senior citizens at a luncheon, where he\r\nexpressed appreciation for their good work, noting “Without\r\nyour dedication, Ghana would not be where it is now”.\r\nFinally, we hope that the dedication of the\r\ninternational community to the well-being of the aged will\r\nbe sustained in the next millennium.\r\nMr. Niehaus (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): We are\r\npleased to participate in these special meetings of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to commemorate the International Year\r\nof Older Persons. This Year is due tribute to older persons,\r\nwho without a doubt make up a valuable sector of society.\r\nWe must recognize our historical debt to older\r\npersons. Their achievements, successes and lessons have\r\ncreated the society in which we live and are the basis for\r\nour own achievements. We must also recognize their\r\ncurrent value and their individual dignity, the contributions\r\nthat they can still make to society, the lessons they can\r\nteach us, their extensive experience and wisdom, their\r\ncompassion and their understanding.\r\nHowever, we note with concern the particular\r\nchallenges that older people face and the problems of\r\nhealth and poverty that threaten them. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to recognize, protect and promote the dignity of\r\nolder persons and to provide them with the best possible\r\nconditions of life so that they can fully fulfil themselves\r\nas individuals. We believe that it is essential to adopt\r\neffective measures to ensure their economic and social\r\nsecurity as well as to give them ample opportunities to\r\ncontribute to national development.\r\nIn this context, my delegation is pleased to reiterate\r\nCosta Rica\u0027s commitment to the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the International Plan of Action\r\nadopted in 1982 by the World Assembly on Ageing. In\r\nthis regard, we support the statement made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Guyana on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nCosta Rica has carried out a number of concrete\r\nmeasures directed towards implementing the Principles\r\ncontained in the International Plan of Action and in\r\nresolution 46/91. We recognize the contributions that the\r\nelderly make to Costa Rican society, and we have noted\r\nthe wide range of difficult situations facing older people\r\nand the need to provide adequate policy responses. We\r\nhave endeavoured to accord them recognition and to\r\nguarantee them the dignity, participation, independence\r\nand right to full development to which they are entitled.\r\nLastly, we have taken the necessary measures to\r\nprovide them with the special care they require. The First\r\nLady of Costa Rica, Mrs. Lorena Clare de Rodríguez, has\r\nparticipated actively, together with a national commission,\r\nin the launching of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons. A high-level forum of national authorities was\r\nheld aimed at elaborating a number of programmes\r\ndirected specifically at older persons. A study was carried\r\nout on the situation of this segment of the population,\r\nnational programmes were reviewed and a national time-\r\ntable prepared for the activities to be carried out in this\r\nconnection.\r\nThe various services provided to older persons in\r\nCosta Rica include multidisciplinary health-care teams\r\ncomprising geriatric specialists, gerontologists, social\r\nworkers, nurses, dentists and so on. These professionals\r\nprovide support networks with social participation as part\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nof a joint effort between the governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental sectors to provide integrated care for the\r\nelderly. This programme has been particularly successful.\r\nAlso in the area of health care, an off-site assistance\r\nprogramme has been launched that provides training for\r\nofficials and the elderly and their families with respect to\r\nthe basic health needs of that segment of the population.\r\nThe programme provides wide coverage at a low cost. In\r\naddition, local committees have been established to care for\r\nthe elderly, with guidance from the national geriatric\r\nhospital. We also have national and local agencies that\r\nprovide care for older persons in case of abuse or\r\nabandonment. A “golden-age” programme has also been set\r\nup through which elderly persons receive special treatment\r\nin banks, public transportation and commercial\r\nestablishments. To this end they are provided with special\r\nidentification cards.\r\nIn order to promote a society for all ages, and in\r\nparticular to improve relations between young people and\r\nthe elderly, a condition has been set for the granting of\r\nfellowships that requires young people to provide services\r\nto older persons. It is felt that communication and\r\napprenticeship between these two groups will benefit both\r\nsegments of the population.\r\nIn this connection, the Office of the First Lady has\r\nsubmitted a bill to the Legislative Assembly for\r\nconsideration and adoption whose aim is to consolidate\r\nexisting achievements and adopt additional measures.\r\nFor all of these reasons, we are very pleased to\r\nsupport the draft resolution submitted to this special\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly, a draft that we are co-\r\nsponsoring with great interest. We hope that it will be\r\nadopted by consensus with a view to contributing to the\r\nestablishment of a society for all ages and to the well-being\r\nof the older persons of the world, who are in such need of\r\nthis and who will so greatly appreciate it.\r\nLastly, we must recognize the important role played\r\nby Ambassador Julia Alvarez of the Dominican Republic in\r\nthe launching of the International Year of Older Persons\r\n1999 on 1 October 1998. We wish also to express\r\nappreciation for the cooperation of the Department of\r\nPublic Information and the non-governmental Committee on\r\nAgeing.\r\nMr. Prosser (Australia): Australia has been a strong\r\nsupporter of the International Year of Older Persons. We\r\nhave warmly embraced the concept within Australia, and in\r\nso doing have been proud to contribute to the\r\ninternational efforts to promote the objectives of the year,\r\nas encapsulated in the United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons, and covering the key areas of independence,\r\nparticipation, care, self-fulfilment and dignity.\r\nAustralia believes that older persons have a critical\r\nrole to play in the development of society. They should\r\nbe viewed as active participants in the global community\r\nwho have an important contribution to make to the\r\ncommunity, rather than persons who are dependent on\r\nsociety for care and respite.\r\nRecognition of the legitimate and valuable role of\r\nolder people in society is increasingly important as the\r\naverage age of the older population increases. As recent\r\nstatistics show, the average age of life expectancy is on\r\nthe increase. On a global scale, more than one in 10\r\npersons are now over the age of 60. This ratio will\r\nincrease further in the coming years.\r\nIn Australia too, the age of our population is\r\nincreasing. In the next 20 years the number of people in\r\nAustralia aged 80 years and over is expected to grow by\r\n63 per cent, from just under 500,000 people in 1996 to\r\nabout 850,000, or one in four, by 2016.\r\nThe Australian Government recognizes the important\r\nand valuable contribution older persons make to our\r\nsociety at the political, community and family levels.\r\nWithin Australia we have considered the International\r\nYear of Older Persons as an important opportunity to\r\npromote a nationwide approach to the issues of ageing, to\r\ncelebrate the diversity and richness of our older\r\npopulation, and to acknowledge their ongoing contribution\r\nto society. In Australia, as in other countries, the\r\nInternational Year has also provided the opportunity and\r\nthe impetus to work actively to change the way\r\nAustralians perceive older people and ageing. We all\r\nknow that shifting attitudes is a fundamental factor in\r\nbringing about real change in society.\r\nAustralia has taken its commitment to the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons seriously. We\r\ncommenced our preparations early. During 1998 extensive\r\ncommunity consultations were undertaken with older\r\npeople in a variety of locations across Australia to ensure\r\nthat the Government’s policy framework for the year\r\nreflected the key issues of importance to these people.\r\nTen major themes emerged from these community\r\nconsultations. These ranged from health and well-being to\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nemployment and education. These provided the basis for the\r\nFederal Government’s priorities and projects during 1999.\r\nThe 10 themes were incorporated into the terms of\r\nreference for the Government’s key policy response to the\r\nInternational Year — a National Strategy for an Ageing\r\nAustralia.\r\nI am pleased to report that under the management of\r\nthe Minister for Aged Care, The Honourable Bronwyn\r\nBishop MP, the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia\r\nhas formed the basis for the development of a series of\r\npractical and innovative initiatives and activities which have\r\nbeen designed to promote, recognize and encourage the role\r\nof older people in our society.\r\nMajor national initiatives have included a national\r\n“Active Australia” media campaign which promotes the\r\nbenefits of activity for older Australians; a national\r\ninformation programme to inform older Australians about\r\nnew technology associated with electronic banking; and a\r\nproject developed by the Department of Employment,\r\nWorkplace Relations and Small Business to assist and\r\npromote mature-age job seekers.\r\nIn the field of education, funding has been provided\r\nfor national programmes such as the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons Learning Circles Project, which is aimed at\r\ndeveloping a programme in each state and territory to offer\r\nolder Australians the opportunity to take part in small,\r\ninformal discussions and learning groups on a variety of\r\ntopics.\r\nAustralia has designed a national Recognition Award\r\nfor Senior Australians and a national Government Senior\r\nAustralian of the Year Award, thereby creating what we\r\nbelieve may be the first awards of their kind. These awards\r\nrecognize the invaluable contribution of senior Australians\r\nto the community. The Government Senior Australian of\r\nthe Year Award was announced by the Prime Minister on\r\n30 September 1999, the eve of the International Day of\r\nOlder Persons. The recipient of the award, Slim Dusty, is\r\na well-known Australian country music singer who relates\r\nwell to all groups of Australians and has been recording\r\ncountry music hits for over 50 years. At 72 years of age, he\r\nignores retirement and continues to do what he loves:\r\nperforming, travelling and recording music to share with\r\nothers. However, more importantly, Slim Dusty is also\r\nknown for his philanthropic activities, which involve\r\nvisiting the sick, playing at concerts for those less fortunate\r\nand working with the Australian Heart Foundation.\r\nUnder the Recognition Awards Programme initiative,\r\nthe community has been encouraged to nominate for an\r\naward senior Australians who are outstanding role models\r\nin the local community. In each electorate, up to 20\r\nsenior Australians who have made a significant\r\ncontribution to their local community will be selected to\r\nreceive Recognition Awards. The most outstanding award\r\nwinner from each electorate will be invited to attend a\r\nnumber of special celebratory events in mid-November\r\n1999 in Australia’s capital city, Canberra.\r\nAs part of a comprehensive communication strategy,\r\nthe Minister for Aged Care recently released a kit which\r\nprovided communities at the local level with a range of\r\ninformation about the International Year of Older Persons\r\nand the implementation of associated activities. A national\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons newsletter and Web\r\nsite have also been developed. The Royal Australian Mint\r\nhas officially launched a six-coin collector’s set with an\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons $1 coin. Australia\r\nPost has released two 45 cent stamps to commemorate the\r\nYear.\r\nIn the health field, the Healthy Ageing Task Force\r\nhas developed a coordinated nationwide approach to\r\nhealthy ageing and the International Year of Older\r\nPersons. The Task Force includes representatives from the\r\nfederal, state and territory governments of Australia. It\r\nhas produced a draft national healthy ageing strategy\r\naimed at identifying challenges for government, business,\r\nthe community and individuals, to meet the needs of\r\nAustralians as they age.\r\nComplementing these initiatives, the Australian\r\nGovernment has worked to encourage widespread\r\ncommunity involvement in the International Year of Older\r\nPersons. Within an overall budget of close to 11 million\r\nAustralian dollars allocated for International Year of\r\nOlder Persons activities, the Government has provided $A\r\n560,000 to establish the Australian Coalition ’99, a\r\nnationwide network of more than 1,100 non-governmental\r\norganizations whose membership is drawn from, and that\r\nare focused on, the ageing population.\r\nAustralian Coalition ’99 has provided an important\r\nframework and coordinated activities and events for the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons in the community.\r\nThe Coalition has proved to be a dynamic force behind\r\nAustralian initiatives to promote the International Year. It\r\nhas also laid a firm foundation within the community for\r\nthe long-term promotion of the objectives of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nAustralia has a deep commitment to working actively\r\nto develop an integrated society in which older people are\r\nnot discriminated against because of their age. It is\r\nimportant that we continue to recognize that the wisdom\r\nand contribution of the older Australian is the foundation\r\nand strength of our society. The activities and initiatives I\r\nhave described in connection with the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons have provided a firm basis for bringing about\r\na real change in Australia’s perceptions of older persons.\r\nWe recognize that this is an ongoing process and that it is\r\nup to both the Government and the community to maintain\r\nthe momentum.\r\nAt the global level, as in Australia, it is important also\r\nto ensure that the momentum for change does not cease\r\nwhen the year draws to a close on 31 December 1999. To\r\nthis end, we support the holding of a global meeting in\r\n2002 to review the outcome of the first World Assembly on\r\nAgeing. Australia expects to be able to report on the\r\nimplementation of its National Strategy for an Ageing\r\nAustralia at that global meeting.\r\nMr. Bundhun (Mauritius): I am deeply pleased and\r\nhonoured to participate, on behalf of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius, in the plenary meetings of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly devoted specifically to\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons. Let me, at the very\r\noutset, take this opportunity to convey to you,\r\nMr. President, and to all the delegations present in this\r\nAssembly, the warmest greetings of my Government and\r\nthe people of Mauritius, in particular our elderly persons.\r\nMy delegation would like to join other delegations in\r\nsaluting the commendable initiative taken by the General\r\nAssembly to devote four plenary meetings at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession to enabling Member States to report on the\r\nobservance of the International Year of Older Persons. This\r\nin itself testifies to the unflinching determination of the\r\ninternational community to provide greater attention to the\r\nconditions of our elderly.\r\nIt is indeed very sad to recall here that, like other\r\nvulnerable groups in our society, such as women and\r\nchildren, the elderly population usually has to bear the\r\nbrunt of the harsh realities of socio-economic development\r\nor the undesirable consequences of natural calamities,\r\nconflicts and terrors of war. Unfortunately, this is the\r\ncurrent situation in several countries which, on account of\r\nvarious circumstances, are unable to provide adequate\r\nattention to the elderly population. On the other hand, over\r\nthe years there has been a growing tendency to overlook the\r\nsignificant contribution of our elderly in the forging of the\r\nsocio-economic development of our respective countries\r\nand, above all, in enabling the world to attain an\r\nunprecedented level of progress and development in\r\nalmost all fields, whether economic, technological or\r\nscientific, over the span of a few decades in the course of\r\nthis century.\r\nIt is in recognition of the exceptional role played by\r\nour elders in the making of this modern world that all\r\nMember States and the world at large should pay tribute\r\nto our elderly population and should strive together,\r\nthrough national and international collaboration, towards\r\ncreating the appropriate conditions for the well-being of\r\nour elders, particularly the less fortunate and vulnerable\r\nones.\r\nWhile the International Plan of Action on Ageing,\r\nadopted at the World Assembly on Ageing in 1982,\r\nsucceeded in arousing world awareness on the ageing\r\nissue, there is currently an urgent need to review that Plan\r\nin order to take into account the socio-economic changes\r\nwhich have taken place over the past 20 years. We\r\ntherefore welcome the proposal to convene a second\r\nWorld Assembly in 2002 with a view to adopting a\r\nrevised plan of action and a long-term strategy on ageing\r\nin the context of a society for all ages.\r\nI am extremely delighted to be given the opportunity\r\nto share with other delegations the efforts made by my\r\ncountry for the observance of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons. As a matter of fact, since October 1998,\r\nthe Government of Mauritius has set up a National\r\nOrganizing Committee under the aegis of the Ministry of\r\nSocial Security, National Solidarity and Senior Citizens\r\nWelfare, made up of all the sectors concerned, to work\r\nout the necessary preparations for the implementation of\r\na programme of activities to mark the celebration of the\r\nyear. In order to show the determination of the\r\nGovernment in promoting the interest of the elderly\r\npopulation, our Prime Minister personally launched the\r\nprogramme of activities in January, and the ceremony was\r\nbroadcast live on television for our elderly population and\r\nthe public at large.\r\nThe programme provides for the implementation of\r\na number of activities with a view to sensitizing the\r\npopulation on the issue of ageing and to providing\r\nopportunities for the social integration of our elderly. The\r\nprogramme relates mainly to the introduction of leisure\r\nand recreational activities for the elderly at all social-\r\nwelfare and community centres located in various parts of\r\nthe country; regional meetings with the participation of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nsome 25,000 elderly persons; essay competitions in schools\r\nand colleges on the theme of the elderly so as to sensitize\r\nthe younger generation about the need to show respect and\r\nprovide care for our elders; talks on intergenerational\r\nsolidarity to emphasize the need for greater collaboration\r\namong generations; trade fairs by the elderly to highlight\r\nthe potential of our elderly population; the issue of a special\r\ncommemorative cover by the Government Post Office; a\r\nmedical week, in the course of which a national campaign\r\nwas launched regarding the health service facilities\r\navailable to the elderly; song and dance competitions to\r\nencourage the participation of the elderly in social\r\nactivities; and the hosting of an international meeting of the\r\nFédération Internationale des Associations de Personnes\r\nAgées. In the course of the meeting, discussions were\r\ncentred on strategies to cope with the ageing phenomenon\r\nand on the need to set up a Federation of Senior Citizens\r\nAssociations in the Indian Ocean region.\r\nThe activities also included a meeting of all\r\ncentenarians with the President of the Republic of Mauritius\r\nat the State House, at which some 20 centenarians were\r\npresent — this might have been a unique event in the\r\nworld; opening of a museum and archives featuring the\r\nvarious facets of life of our elders from their arrival as\r\nimmigrants; an open day for our institutions providing\r\nresidential care to the elderly; story-telling competitions;\r\nand a special get-together for elderly couples who have\r\nlived 50 years or more of married life together.\r\nIn addition to those activities, a number of firms in the\r\nprivate sector have agreed, in the context of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, to provide facilities to\r\nour elderly such as: reduced prices for cinema tickets;\r\nreduced entry fees at nature parks; reduced bus prices for\r\noutings; special packages for travelling to dependency\r\nislands; and reserved seats in buses. I am particularly\r\npleased to report that all these activities have been\r\nsuccessfully implemented, with the participation of some\r\n450 senior citizens associations representing some 25,000\r\nelderly persons.\r\nMoreover, since the proclamation in 1992 of\r\n1 October as the International Day of Older Persons, the\r\nGovernment of Mauritius has been organizing on that day\r\nevery year special recreational activities on public beaches\r\naround the country, with the participation of some 20,000\r\nsenior citizens. On 1 October of this year, which is the last\r\nof this century, we organized a national exhibition on the\r\nelderly, featuring photos, utensils, traditional dresses,\r\nmusical instruments and other items which have been used\r\nby our elders in the past. We are planning to proceed in\r\nNovember with the opening of a recreation centre for the\r\nelderly, which will be of international standard and which\r\nwill provide residential accommodation for about 150\r\npersons at a time. This recreation centre will be unique in\r\nthe Indian Ocean region.\r\nWe are also proposing to introduce in the very near\r\nfuture appropriate legislation to generally protect the\r\nrights of the elderly and to ensure that our elderly\r\nresiding in homes receive the required care within\r\nacceptable norms. A senior citizens welfare fund will also\r\nbe set up soon with a view to providing emergency\r\nassistance to needy elderly persons who are unable to\r\nmeet the basic necessities of life. In this connection, a\r\ncomité de sages will also be set up at every social welfare\r\nand community centre in order to identify those needy\r\nelderly requiring such assistance.\r\nIt is worth mentioning here that, following a cabinet\r\nreshuffle about a week ago, our Prime Minister has\r\nofficially added to my responsibilities the welfare of the\r\nelderly, changing the name of my ministry from the\r\nMinistry of Social Security and National Solidarity to the\r\nMinistry of Social Security, National Solidarity and\r\nSenior Citizens’ Welfare. This addition was made in\r\nrecognition of the increasing importance attached by the\r\nGovernment of Mauritius to the issue of the elderly,\r\nespecially in the context of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons. However, I must emphasize that, well\r\nbefore the advent of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, the Government of Mauritius had for a number\r\nof years been very attentive to the social needs of our\r\nelderly persons and has been providing them with\r\nadequate support and protection in terms of: a monthly\r\nnon-contributory pension payable on a universal basis to\r\nevery citizen aged 60 years and above; payment of an\r\nadditional monthly pension to elderly persons requiring\r\nconstant personal care and attention; the setting up of\r\nsenior citizens’ associations around the country to\r\npromote the organization of recreational and leisure\r\nactivities for the elderly; organization throughout the year\r\nof a number of activities such as outings and residential\r\nholiday camps; facilities such as rebates on air fares,\r\nreduced fees for the issuance of passports, exemptions\r\nfrom payment of airport tax, half fare for bus travel,\r\nhome visits for those aged 90 and above, issue of\r\nblankets and assistive devices to disabled elderly people;\r\nand provision of a cash gift and support for the one-\r\nhundredth birthday celebrations of our centenarians,\r\nwhose present number is 38 and is expected to reach 45\r\nby the end of the year.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nIn addition, over the past four years, the Government\r\nhas introduced new policy measures to consolidate further\r\nexisting social support schemes so as to reduce inequalities\r\nand provide greater protection for the elderly population. In\r\nthis respect, since 1996, my Government has granted an\r\nincrease of more than 100 per cent in the non-contributory\r\npensions payable to the elderly population. A project for the\r\nrenovation of charitable institutions providing residential\r\ncare to the elderly has also been under way, in\r\ncollaboration with the Luxembourg Government, since last\r\nyear. The project, costing 52 million Mauritian rupees,\r\ncomprises the modernization of equipment, the training of\r\nstaff and the renovation of these institutions with a view to\r\nimproving the quality of life of their inmates.\r\nIncreasing efforts are also being made to sensitize the\r\npopulation on the ageing issue, which is becoming a serious\r\nconcern to many countries. In fact, the world population of\r\npersons over 60 years of age has increased rapidly and is\r\nexpected to reach 616 million in 2000 and 1.2 billion in\r\n2025. Mauritius is no exception to this phenomenon. The\r\nproportion of persons aged 60 and above has increased\r\nfrom 6 per cent of the total population in 1972 to 9.6 per\r\ncent at present, and is expected to reach 19 per cent by the\r\nyear 2025. As in many other countries, this phenomenon of\r\nageing is expected to have serious socio-economic\r\nimplications, mainly in terms of increased social security\r\nbenefits and public sector pensions and increased\r\nexpenditure on health care and housing. We have already\r\nstarted to address this complex issue with the preparation of\r\na white paper on ageing containing a number of proposals\r\nand measures for implementation over the coming years.\r\nThis white paper is currently under serious consideration by\r\na high-level ministerial committee.\r\nThe Government of Mauritius is deeply committed\r\nto promoting the welfare of the elderly population. In\r\nfact, this commitment is inherent in the history of our\r\ncountry, which has made significant socio-economic\r\nprogress over the span of a century thanks to the\r\ndedication, hard work and spirit of sacrifice of our\r\nforefathers, who were brought from other shores to settle\r\nin our country. We have therefore never spared any effort\r\nto pay tribute to the valuable contribution of our\r\nforefathers in making our country achieve a worldwide\r\nreputation in terms of socio-economic progress, peace,\r\nstability and respect for human rights.\r\nIn the context of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, it is only fitting that we pay due recognition to\r\nthe contribution of our elders in the development of our\r\ncountries and in the safeguard of our traditions, values\r\nand cultures, which are so important for our national\r\nstability. Let us therefore take advantage of their valuable\r\nexperience and let their sense of dedication, their spirit of\r\nsacrifice and their moral values be a permanent source of\r\ninspiration to us, and particularly to our younger\r\ngeneration.\r\nDespite being a small country, Mauritius is\r\nextremely delighted to be able share with other Member\r\nStates its encouraging experience with regard to the care\r\nand support schemes provided for its elderly population.\r\nIn the spirit of the theme of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons — “Towards a society for all ages” — let\r\nour young generation, in a gesture of intergenerational\r\nsolidarity, open up their arms towards our elders and\r\nprovide them with the required support.\r\nMay I now conclude by reaffirming the commitment\r\nof my Government to attaining the goals and objectives\r\nset out by the United Nations in the context of the\r\nobservance of the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco) (spoke in French): In all\r\nhuman societies, older persons have occupied an essential,\r\neven a dominant, place. Historians, ethnologists,\r\nsociologists all agree: older persons represented, even in\r\nthe most ancient civilizations sources of inspiration,\r\nwisdom and judgement. They were esteemed and\r\nrespected, their words heeded. Their life experience often\r\nserved as reference points for the conduct of affairs in the\r\ncommunity, the village or the city. Their status has\r\ndeclined over the years, until the elderly became isolated,\r\nsometimes even excluded from society.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nDoubtless changing lifestyles may partly explain this\r\nphenomenon. Increasing urbanization, the dispersal of\r\nfamilies, the organization of labour, different values, more\r\nindividual than those that governed human relations even\r\njust a few decades ago — all these have weakened the role\r\nof elderly people in daily life.\r\nSocieties today, so-called modern or progressive\r\nsocieties, inspired by the international community and the\r\nwill of nations, have decided to commemorate each year on\r\nthe first of October an international day in their honour,\r\ndoubtless because they have understood that it would be a\r\nreal mistake to neglect the wealth of the accumulated and\r\ncompounded lived experience of our elders and not to tap\r\nthe availability and good will of thousands of people with\r\nmany abilities.\r\nBarely a year ago, on 1 October 1998, the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons was launched\r\nsuccessfully throughout the world and at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters on the theme, “A society for all ages”. The\r\nPrincipality of Monaco unreservedly endorsed the\r\nproclaimed goal of this theme. The involvement of my\r\ncountry in the commemoration of this Year was symbolized\r\nby the production of a postal stamp reproducing the logo\r\nchosen by the United Nations.\r\nThe Principality’s Government, furthermore, upon the\r\ninitiation of His Serene Highness, the Sovereign Prince,\r\norganized some special events to commemorate the Year.\r\nIn particular, we developed and carried out a policy for\r\nageing, striving to preserve and strengthen inter-\r\ngenerational solidarity and to promote the inspiring concept\r\nof a society for all ages. Since 1 October 1998 and until the\r\nend of this year, events have been organized and\r\ncoordinated with a steering committee of public authorities,\r\nassociations of retirees and young people, as well as social\r\norganizations. These various events have brought the\r\ngenerations closer. Young students have been invited to\r\nhelp in these cultural or educational or social events, among\r\nwhich I could refer to the organization of medical\r\nconferences, exhibiting works of art and the publication of\r\na book of older persons’ reminiscences related to Monaco’s\r\nhistory.\r\nA policy for older persons attests to the fundamental\r\nvalues that a country intends to promote. For many years\r\nnow, we in Monaco have worked on actions to improve the\r\nliving standards of older people, providing care facilities,\r\nfinancial assistance and specific measures to make their\r\ndaily lives easier in an atmosphere of safety, with things\r\nsuch as meals on wheels, home help and medical alert\r\nsystems.\r\nUpon the initiative of His Serene Highness, and in\r\naccordance with the guidelines of the World Health\r\nOrganization, we have established services to allow the\r\nelderly and the disabled to continue to live at home. Of\r\ncourse, these people can still choose whether to remain at\r\nhome or to be moved to a residence.\r\nTurning to Government housing activities, a certain\r\nnumber of apartments will be specially designed for older\r\nand disabled persons and built in busy neighbourhoods,\r\nnear shops and public transportation. For persons who\r\nneed to placed in an institution, a long-term-stay\r\nestablishment near the Princess Grace Hospital Centre\r\nwill be built very soon.\r\nTurning to financial matters, older Monagasques and\r\nolder persons residing in Monaco receive, if necessary, a\r\nmonthly allowance to subsidize their needs. The amount\r\nof this allowance, increased by 10 per cent this year on\r\nthe occasion of the jubilee of His Serene Highness, the\r\nSovereign Prince, is now close to the minimum wage.\r\nThese initiatives are particularly essential since the\r\nageing of the population and the drop in the birth rate are\r\nparticularly marked in our country. At the last population\r\ncensus, it was revealed that 22 per cent of our residents\r\nwere over 65, and 11 per cent were over 75. According\r\nto some projections, in 2010 persons over 65 years old\r\nwill account for 25 per cent of the population, whereas\r\nbetween the years 1990 and 2010, the percentage of\r\npersons over 85 is to increase by over 60 per cent.\r\nSince the age pyramid is shrinking and could\r\ndisappear, and since longevity is increasing, States both\r\nin the North and in the South need to adopt a new\r\napproach to ageing. It is now up to political and social\r\nleaders, in cooperation with the older people themselves,\r\nfamilies and communities, to conceive of ageing in an\r\nactive, dynamic way, not just as a matter of passive\r\nmaintenance.\r\nNew demographic trends are forcing Governments to\r\nconsider means to promote an old age which is more\r\ninvolved in society and community activities. This means\r\nthat throughout a person’s life span, physical and material\r\ncapacities of individuals, particularly of women, whose\r\naverage life expectancy is longer than that of men, must\r\nbe maintained and even developed.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nThe policy adopted by the Government of the\r\nPrincipality seeks to ensure, in the context of increased\r\nlongevity, living standards that meet the aspirations of our\r\nsociety and that are adapted to the context of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco. It will achieve this by involving all\r\nof the community, including young people, in order to\r\nmaintain this very valuable link between generations.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the activities\r\nand the legacy of the Year attests to the interest shown by\r\nStates, the United Nations system and non-governmental\r\norganizations in establishing infrastructures and relations\r\namong various stakeholders to make it possible, as the\r\nprogramme of action on ageing advocates, that the\r\npreparation of the population as a whole for the last stages\r\nof life is an integral part of social policies and takes into\r\naccount physical, psychological, cultural, religious, spiritual,\r\neconomic, health and all other factors.\r\nWe are convinced that the special session the General\r\nAssembly will hold next year on the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development will make it possible to\r\ndefine specific strategies to establish “A society for all\r\nages”. Accordingly, the United Nations programme on\r\nageing, which served as the secretariat for the International\r\nYear of Older Persons and which is the key element for the\r\nsuccess of this commemoration, will have a decisive role to\r\nplay in the follow-up to the Year. We would like to assure\r\nthat secretariat of our full support.\r\nThe delegation of Monaco would also like to express\r\nits full support for the draft resolution resulting from our\r\nefforts.\r\nMrs. Eldermire-Shearer (Jamaica): Jamaica\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by Guyana on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. We wish to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the support and leadership he has\r\nprovided on this issue. We also acknowledge the invaluable\r\ncontribution of Ambassador Julia Tavares de Alvarez of the\r\nDominican Republic to the promotion of issues relating to\r\nthe elderly.\r\nIt is no coincidence that the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons is being observed at the end of this century,\r\na century that has witnessed some of the most profound\r\nchanges in human society. The rapid advances in science\r\nand technology, which have resulted in dramatic\r\nimprovements in health, hygiene, nutrition and longevity,\r\nhave also been attended by a swelling of the number of\r\npersons living to old age. Since 1950, global life\r\nexpectancy has risen by 20 years to its present level of 60\r\nyears. The proportion of older persons has also increased\r\nsignificantly. Currently, 1 of every 10 persons is now 60\r\nyears or older, and by the year 2050, 1 in 5 will be 60 or\r\nolder. The subject is of particular importance to the\r\nCaribbean, given that its ageing population is the oldest\r\nin the developing world.\r\nAccordingly, we are grateful for the focus that has\r\nbeen placed on the challenges created by this\r\ndemographic revolution, and for the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the issue. The report demonstrates\r\nthat the issue of population ageing is a complex\r\ninteraction requiring collaboration between many\r\nagencies, governmental departments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. It is critical that ageing\r\npolicies be integrated into the broader development\r\nframework.\r\nJamaica is also experiencing its own version of the\r\ndemographic revolution, and the Government has\r\nestablished programmes to deal with the challenges that\r\nthis phenomenon presents. Currently, senior citizens make\r\nup 10 per cent of the Jamaican population, and our life\r\nexpectancy is in excess of 72 years. The elderly also\r\nmake up the only segment of our population that\r\nincreases in percentage terms from year to year. It is\r\nprojected that by the year 2020 there will be\r\napproximately 400,000 senior citizens in Jamaica. In\r\nrecognition of the additional needs of senior citizens —\r\nin particular, their additional health-care needs — the\r\nJamaica Drugs for the Elderly Programme was instituted\r\nfor all seniors, regardless of income levels. The\r\nProgramme subsidizes the cost of prescription drugs for\r\nailments that are particularly prevalent among the aged.\r\nThere are now more than 100,000 persons age 60 and\r\nolder registered in the Programme.\r\nThe Government of Jamaica, in recognizing the\r\nimportance of senior citizens, in 1976 established a\r\nNational Council on Ageing to advise on and develop\r\nprogrammes to improve the quality of life of seniors. The\r\nCouncil has both national and field operations, which are\r\noperated mainly by volunteers. The Council was the\r\nnamed focal point for the International Year of Older\r\nPersons and organized the Year\u0027s programmes. The\r\nGovernment provided the operational budget, and the\r\nprivate sector provided substantial additional assistance.\r\nThe list of activities is being circulated in this Hall. I will,\r\nhowever, highlight a few.\r\nThe Government of Jamaica remains committed to\r\nthe advancement of our senior citizens and has viewed the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nobservance of this year as an opportunity both to address\r\ndeficiencies in the policies and programmes that relate to\r\nolder persons and to build collaborative relationships. The\r\nactivities for the year were organized around the general\r\ntheme of “Towards a society for all ages”, with particular\r\nemphasis being placed on two of the suggested sub-themes:\r\nthe intergenerational approach and the developmental\r\naspects of population ageing.\r\nEducation on ageing and associated issues was a major\r\nthrust of the Year. A major initiative, which will continue\r\ninto the new millennium, is the education of young persons\r\nand their teachers about the life-course perspective of\r\nageing. A second objective is to increase understanding and\r\nrespect for older persons on the part of the other\r\ngenerations. Young persons need to understand that ageing\r\nis not a disease but a natural and inevitable process and that\r\nthey should begin preparing for this stage of life while they\r\nare still young. A poster and essay competition was\r\nlaunched in support of this effort. The education component\r\nincluded a programme for other age groups, including the\r\nmid-life group, in support of the Active Ageing Global\r\nEmbrace campaign.\r\nFor the future, strong collaborative efforts with the\r\nMinistry of Education — efforts supported personally by\r\nboth Ministers — will continue. They will include\r\ncurriculum development and education activities for\r\nstudents and teachers. The University of the West Indies,\r\nwith funding from Help Age International, has developed\r\na training programme for caregivers. This programme is\r\nsimple enough to understand regardless of the trainee\u0027s level\r\nof literacy. The programme was developed in recognition\r\nof the importance of caregiving, which will be of increasing\r\nimportance in the years to come. In recognition of the\r\nInternational Year, a manual for family caregiving is now\r\nbeing prepared.\r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for the earlier\r\ninitiatives that produced the global and national targets that\r\nare the foundations of Jamaica\u0027s National Policy on Ageing.\r\nThe National Policy, which was submitted in Parliament in\r\n1997 was widely publicized during the Year. It addresses\r\neight main areas, including education, health, social security\r\nand income security. Advocacy was an essential tool in\r\neducating the population on the Government\u0027s National\r\nPolicy. I wish to thank the local media in Jamaica for their\r\ncollaboration, which included the weekly publication in the\r\nDaily Gleaner of a page dedicated to senior citizens\u0027 affairs.\r\nThe Government also sought to ensure that the subject\r\nof ageing remained at the forefront of the regional agenda.\r\nThe Government moved resolutions at key meetings, such\r\nas at the Caribbean Community\u0027s (CARICOM) Council on\r\nHuman and Social Development in February 1999.\r\nCARICOM is also spearheading acceptance of a draft\r\ncharter in support of healthy ageing, which charter was\r\ninitiated in collaboration with the Pan American Health\r\nOrganization. The charter recognizes that patterns of\r\nliving that enhance healthy and active ageing are formed\r\nearly in life and continue throughout the lifespan. These\r\npatterns determine how well one is able to reduce and\r\navoid diseases and disabilities and engage in social and\r\nproductive activities.\r\nJamaica launched this charter at the national level\r\nduring the walk in support of the Global Embrace on 2\r\nOctober 1999. The charter was presented to leaders of\r\nGovernment, the private sector, trade unions, the churches\r\nand other non-governmental organizations that endorsed\r\nit at the launch.\r\nIn addition to economic concerns, research has\r\nidentified loneliness and the lack of opportunities for\r\nsocial interaction as main concerns for Jamaica\u0027s senior\r\ncitizens. There is now a programme, funded by a non-\r\ngovernmental organization but operated by the National\r\nCouncil, to support the income-generating activities of the\r\nseniors in Golden Age Clubs as a way of supporting\r\nproductive ageing. More than 300 projects have been\r\ninitiated, 30 of which were funded during the\r\nInternational Year.\r\nAs our hearts and eyes eagerly await the dawn of a\r\nnew century and the promises which this exciting time\r\nwill bring, let us not forget those who have accomplished\r\nmuch before us and upon whose shoulders we have built\r\nour present societies. It is our hope that future generations\r\nwill be able to build a better, more compassionate world\r\nfor our senior citizens in the years to come, so as to\r\nrealize the aims of this year towards a society for all\r\nages.\r\nMs. Corado-Cuevas (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The Government of Guatemala welcomes all\r\nmeasures to promote the ongoing development and full\r\nparticipation of older persons, the guardians of the\r\nwisdom and values of our Guatemalan society,\r\nparticularly within our indigenous population.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nOur country is making a constant effort, within\r\nexisting limitations, to translation the principles of the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing, adopted in Vienna\r\nin 1982, into government policies and practical measures to\r\nmeet the priority needs of older persons. Although a great\r\ndeal remains to be done, the State and its institutions are\r\nresponsible for providing older persons with the necessary\r\nconditions to ensure their quality of life by creating\r\nforward-looking mechanisms and strengthening national\r\ninstitutions that work on their behalf.\r\nIn this respect, Guatemala has adopted, inter alia, the\r\nfollowing measures to protect older persons.\r\nFirst, it enacted the Law on the Protection of Persons\r\non the Third Age — Decree 80-96 of the Legislative\r\nOrgan — whose purpose is to protect the interests of the\r\nelderly and to guarantee them living standards that are\r\nadequate for a useful and dignified existence. Its broad\r\ncoverage includes, among other things, their right to\r\nparticipate in the national development process, their access\r\nwithout discrimination to sources of employment and their\r\ntraining for a second occupation. The Ministry of Public\r\nHealth is responsible for health coverage. It is the\r\nresponsibility of municipalities to eliminate architectural\r\nbarriers to free movement, while public and private services\r\nare urged to provide exemptions and discounts in\r\nrecognition of the social and economic situation of\r\nindividuals. The foundations are also being laid to prevent\r\nand penalize mistreatment.\r\nSecondly, we have created the post of Advocate for\r\nthe Elderly within the National Attorney General\u0027s office.\r\nIts function is to support older persons in the case of verbal\r\nor physical abuse.\r\nThirdly, we have enacted the Law to Eradicate Family\r\nViolence — Decree 90-96 of the Legislative Organ —\r\nwhich protects the most vulnerable members of the family:\r\nchildren, women and the elderly.\r\nI wish to make special reference to the Councils of\r\nElders in our rural indigenous population, in which the\r\nelderly serve as guides to their people. These Councils are\r\nan example of power and authority established by the\r\ncommunity; they provide guidance for the group and\r\nresolve conflicts. The members of the Councils orally\r\ntransmit culture and knowledge, including traditional\r\nmedicine. Women, unlike their counterparts elsewhere, play\r\na role that is equally important as that of men. The\r\nGovernment of Guatemala is striving to help strengthen\r\nsocial indigenous institutions and, to that end, supports\r\nthe Councils of Elders.\r\nIn addition, in commemoration of the International\r\nYear of Older Persons, a series of activities has been\r\ncarried out in Guatemala to heighten the interest of the\r\nvarious sectors and to eliminate social and cultural\r\nbarriers for older persons. We would cite, inter alia, the\r\nconvening of congresses on gerontology, grandparents\u0027\r\nfairs, health fairs, courses, sporting events,\r\nmultigenerational parades, concerts, forums and so on,\r\nculminating last Saturday with a parade and a\r\n“Worldwide Embrace”, with the participation of the\r\nPresident of the Republic.\r\nIn the future, we shall continue to strengthen all\r\nthose activities in favour of older persons. That is why we\r\nsupport the convening of an international meeting in 2002\r\nto review the outcome of the World Assembly on Ageing.\r\nWe also feel that the 1982 International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing should be updated.\r\nLastly, I wish to express appreciation for the work\r\ncarried out by the two Vice-Chairmen of the Consultative\r\nGroup for the International Year of Older Persons:\r\nAmbassador Julia Tavares de Alvarez of the Dominican\r\nRepublic and Counsellor Aurelio Fernández of Spain.\r\nSince its establishment, the Consultative Group has been\r\nan important forum for exchanging information and\r\nexperience among the various delegations, organs of the\r\nsystem and non-governmental organizations. It has\r\nenabled a continuous process of consultations to explore\r\nand analyze new individual and joint initiatives on issues\r\nconcerning the third age.\r\nMr. Ribeiro Mendes (Portugal): Allow me to stress\r\nthat Portugal fully subscribes to the statement made by\r\nthe Finnish Presidency of the European Union.\r\nPortugal, like most developed countries, is currently\r\nfacing the enormous political, social and economic\r\nchallenges associated with the accentuated ageing of its\r\npopulation. It is in this group of older persons that the\r\nrisk of social exclusion is most prevalent. Also, several\r\nchallenges arise from the ageing of the work force and\r\nthe relative decrease in the economically active\r\npopulation. These challenges require the management of\r\nhuman resources to focus to a greater extent on age-\r\nrelated issues, a factor that has been neglected until now.\r\nThey also call for the reformulation of policies that\r\ntraditionally have provided incentives for early retirement\r\nfrom the labour market and for a new focus on lifelong\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\neducation and the provision of new opportunities for the\r\nelderly.\r\nA second aspect of this challenge has to do with the\r\npressures exerted on pension schemes and on public\r\nfinancial resources as a result of the growing number of\r\nretirees and the overall decrease in the population of\r\nworking age. The growing need for health and social\r\nsupport services for the older person is a third aspect of\r\nthese challenges. The dramatic increase in the number of\r\nolder persons needing assistance will exert growing\r\npressure on the existing long-term care system. Policies\r\naimed at limiting an increase in dependency through the\r\nfostering of healthy ageing, the prevention of accidents and\r\nrecovery following illness should be adopted.\r\nTo achieve these goals, the Portuguese Government\r\nhas been developing innovative social policies for the active\r\npromotion of social rights. Thus, the following measures\r\nand social programmes have been developed.\r\nIn 1996 Portugal launched the guaranteed minimum\r\nincome programme, which presently supports more than\r\n130,000 families and nearly 400,000 persons, accounting\r\nfor 4 per cent of the population of the country, of whom\r\n90,000 are already covered by social insertion programmes.\r\nA significant portion of the beneficiaries are older persons\r\naged 65 years or over.\r\nPortugal has also adopted a new policy that\r\ndifferentiates the yearly increases of benefits to assist the\r\nmore than 1 million individuals whose pensions are lower\r\nthan the national minimum wage. At the same time,\r\nentitlement to old age pensions is now more flexible, so\r\nthat the workers may adjust the timing of their retirement\r\nto professional, family or even labour market factors. When\r\nchanges were made the preservation and financial\r\nsustainability of the social security system were kept in\r\nmind.\r\nThe measures I have mentioned do not pre-empt the\r\nneed for the definition of a coherent strategy for the reform\r\nof Portugal\u0027s social security system, within the framework\r\nof our integration in the European Union.\r\nAs defined by the Portuguese Government, there are\r\nthree major areas of universal social welfare which respond\r\nto new social risks, changes in the economy and the new\r\nethics of the contractual partnership between the State and\r\nits citizens. These areas are, first, the protection of\r\nvulnerable groups and individuals, which is pursued through\r\na system of entitlements based on citizenship and\r\nguaranteed through national solidarity; secondly, the\r\nprotection of families, accomplished through the provision\r\nof cash benefits and services for the support of the older\r\nperson facing dependency and other situations of great\r\nvulnerability; and, thirdly, income substitution schemes,\r\nwhich, through mandatory social security contributory\r\nregimes based on inter-professional and inter-generational\r\nsolidarity, as well as voluntary private pension schemes,\r\nare to be fostered through adequate policies and\r\nincentives.\r\nPortugal, as a member of the European Union, has\r\nplaced social policies involving employment, job training,\r\nhealth, solidarity and social security at the very centre of\r\nits development model. These policies are in tune with the\r\nfundamental choices of the Union, with a view to a\r\nsustainable growth of the economy, with social justice, in\r\na Europe for all ages.\r\nThe need to develop an active strategy for ageing\r\nhas frequently been highlighted, both in the area of\r\nemployment policies and in the areas of social action,\r\nhealth care and family policies.\r\nOur policies of active ageing will continue to\r\nremove the constraints on lifelong flexibility for all\r\ncitizens, so as to offer them a greater selection of options\r\nin areas such as education, job training, employment and\r\nhealth that can help them preserve their autonomy during\r\nold age. Thus, prolonged care should be regarded as a\r\nnatural social risk to be jointly financed by the\r\neconomically active population and the older person.\r\nBalanced access to home care and institutions should\r\nensure an increasingly wider and financially sustainable\r\ncoverage.\r\nThe reform of our public pensions system should\r\nalso be considered in the light of this strategy of active\r\nageing, taking into account the increase in longevity and\r\nthe economic value of the older person as a human\r\nresource.\r\nThe need for new benefits geared specifically to the\r\nchronic dependency of the oldest citizens is also being\r\naddressed. In particular, as of July this year the social\r\nprotection to be extended to old-age pensioners in a\r\nsituation of dependency was defined and regulated. This\r\nresulted in the establishment of cash benefits whose\r\namount varies according to the degree of dependency.\r\nIn conclusion, the autonomy of the older person and\r\nthe enhancement of the abilities and skills of both\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nfamilies and the community to deal with long-term\r\ndependency are now the main objectives of our social\r\npolicies.\r\nAs stated by the presidency of the European Union\r\nyesterday, Portugal also regards the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons as an important starting point and an\r\nopportunity to continue to build a world in which all\r\ngenerations may fully enjoy their rights of citizenship,\r\nfulfilling their personal goals in freedom and solidarity.\r\nThe actions taken within the United Nations system,\r\nwhich we praise, will yield their fruits if we can follow up\r\non them. For our part, we will not relent in our efforts to\r\ndevelop active ageing strategies that allow older persons to\r\nlive a longer life, with greater autonomy and fully\r\nintegrated in the society to which they belong.\r\nWe will pursue these efforts in total solidarity with all\r\nthe peoples of the world, continuing to contribute to this\r\ncause, which, from the old Europe to the emerging new\r\ncountries, has often involved terrible social and human\r\ncosts, particularly for the elderly and other vulnerable\r\ngroups. The ongoing creation of the independent State of\r\nEast Timor, which dramatically illustrates this, constitutes\r\na responsibility for all mankind that will deserve our\r\ncontinued support.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): I wish to associate myself\r\nwith the statement made by the Permanent Representative\r\nof Guyana, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report (A/54/268) of the\r\nSecretary-General and commends him for his efforts on this\r\nissue. As this year draws to a close, the world is reminded\r\nthat all members of society should be given equal\r\nopportunities, irrespective of their age, as long as those\r\ncitizens are able to participate in the activities of a society.\r\nWe are also reminded of the new thinking that older\r\npersons must be viewed not as burdens on society, but\r\nrather, as useful citizens with equal obligations to shape our\r\nfuture.\r\nNambia\u0027s commitment to its older citizens is well\r\nknown. Namibia is one of the very few countries in Africa\r\nwhich pay an old-age pension to its citizens who have\r\nreached the age of 60 years, until their departure from this\r\nworld. Although this old-age pension is not sufficient to\r\nprovide for all the needs of our elderly, especially for those\r\nwho live in urban areas, it provides income and important\r\nsustenance to the majority of our elderly who live in rural\r\nareas. This old-age pension has also made it possible for\r\nthe elderly in our society to care for their grandchildren,\r\nmost of whom are left orphaned after their parents have\r\ndied of the AIDS virus.\r\nIn addition to the old-age pension, the Government\r\nof Namibia also provides social welfare services to the\r\nelderly in the form of old-age homes. The elderly in these\r\nhomes are provided with adequate care, including health\r\ncare. They are also treated as State patients at no cost.\r\nIn order to supplement the insufficient old-age\r\npension, the President of the Republic of Namibia will be\r\nlaunching a pension fund for the elderly at the end of this\r\nmonth. This launching is undertaken to coincide with the\r\nyear-long activities of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons. The Government of Namibia is also currently\r\nadvocating the possibility of formulating a national plan\r\non the aged in our society.\r\nIt is estimated that by the year 2050, the elderly\r\npopulation of 60 years of age and older will be over\r\n2 billion. This would be the first time in the history of\r\nhumankind that the number of elderly would be greater\r\nthan the number of children. It is also estimated that in\r\nthe year 2050 the percentage of people of age 60 or older\r\nin Namibia will be more than three times what it is now.\r\nIt has been said that although we are living in the\r\nage of ageing, it is a territory of uncharted waters. It is a\r\ngiven fact that we are all talking about increased life\r\nexpectancy in terms of expectations for quality of life and\r\nthe type of services required to cope with future\r\nincreasingly aged societies. Older men and women will\r\nrequire opportunities and support systems, including for\r\nincome generation, social security and health care. We\r\nmust thus plan in advance.\r\nIt is therefore fitting that the International Year’s\r\ntheme is “A society for all ages”. The older people of\r\ntoday are in many ways the pioneers of yesterday and the\r\nfoundation of tomorrow. Their tenacity and courage made\r\nour future so much easier, safer and healthier. It is thus\r\nincumbent upon all of us to make sure that we live in a\r\nsociety which will not discriminate against the aged. After\r\nall, we are all following the same path. It is only a matter\r\nof time before we ourselves will become the aged of\r\ntomorrow.\r\nIn this regard, we wish to express our appreciation\r\nfor the preparatory work of the past two years to declare\r\n1999 the International Year of Older Persons. This has\r\nbeen a collaborative and cooperative effort by\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nGovernments, the United Nations system and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. The adoption of the United\r\nNations Principles for Older Persons in 1991 and the\r\nadoption of the International Plan of Action on Ageing in\r\n1992 provide us with a broad framework and guidance on\r\nwhat action to take on ageing.\r\nI cannot conclude my remarks without referring to the\r\nnegative impact the AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa\r\nhas on our elderly population. In my country, Namibia, the\r\nelderly are left to care for the children who have become\r\norphans after their parents have succumbed to the disease.\r\nTheir role becomes that not only of grandparents but also\r\nof parents and caretakers. This has left the Government of\r\nNamibia with no other option but to redouble its efforts to\r\nensure that this burden is mitigated by giving security to\r\nour elderly and supporting their needs in raising the\r\nchildren left behind.\r\nHowever, in most traditional societies, such as that of\r\nNamibia, the elderly are also taken care of by the society\r\nand by their immediate families. Our customs require that\r\nthe elderly be taken care of and provided for. For it is they\r\nwho shaped our future.\r\nThis issue of the elderly is of particular importance to\r\nus, and therefore we hope that the draft resolution on this\r\nsubject will be adopted without a vote.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): On 28\r\nAugust 1948, the Argentine Government adopted the\r\nDeclaration of Old Age Rights. This Declaration recognized\r\nthat older persons enjoy specific rights: the rights to\r\nassistance, accommodation, food, physical and moral health\r\ncare, recreation, work, stability and respect.\r\nThat initiative, supported by all political efforts and\r\nsupplemented by adequate budgetary resources, was an\r\nimportant social step forward for Argentina, a country\r\ncharacterized by a multicultural population that was still\r\nassimilating the great influx of migration of the nineteenth\r\nand early twentieth centuries.\r\nIn 1948, the world had scarcely begun to recover from\r\nthe Second World War. In its tragic aftermath, great\r\ninstruments were being created, such as the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which was adopted at the\r\nend of that same year, and the Geneva Conventions,\r\nadopted the following year.\r\nBut longevity was not such an urgent question at that\r\ntime: a developing country’s stipulations that older persons\r\nenjoyed rights inherent to their age was in the vanguard.\r\nThat initiative went beyond Argentina’s domestic sphere.\r\nIt is interesting to reread United Nations documents\r\nfrom that time. On page 618 of the Yearbook of the\r\nUnited Nations for 1948-1949, it says that on 23\r\nSeptember 1948 Argentina raised this issue in document\r\nA/621 at the third session of the General Assembly, held\r\nthat year at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, requesting its\r\ninclusion in the agenda and submitting the Draft\r\nDeclaration of Old Age Rights in document A/C.3/213.\r\nDuring the night meeting of the Third Committee on\r\n22 November 1948, Ambassador Enrique Corominas\r\nintroduced the item on behalf of Argentina. On 30\r\nNovember, the Committee adopted it by 28 votes in\r\nfavour, with 10 abstentions. That night, following the\r\nvote, the Argentine representative thanked representatives\r\nwho had voted in favour of the Argentine proposal. He\r\nalso thanked the representatives who had abstained,\r\nbecause the assistance of both had made it possible to\r\nconsecrate a legitimate right that someday would be\r\nincorporated into the legislation of all countries.\r\nFinally, on 4 December 1948, the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 213 (III) by 48 votes in favour, none\r\nagainst and 1 abstention. Thus, the question of older\r\npersons was introduced for the first time in the United\r\nNations. The rights envisaged in that 1948 ideal today are\r\nfound in the 62 recommendations of the International Plan\r\nof Action on Ageing of 1982 and in other subsequent\r\ninstruments.\r\nFifty-one years have passed since 1948. That is not\r\nso long, for it is the same number of years remaining\r\nuntil 2050, when the number of people over 60 will\r\nexceed the number of those under 15. In some places this\r\nwill even occur some decades earlier. The extension of\r\naverage lifespan, particularly in the societies that create\r\nmost wealth, and the decline in the birth rate, are\r\nproducing an unprecedented demographic shift in which\r\nthe population pyramid looks like the one of 50 years\r\nago, turned upside down. These statistics show that in a\r\nfew more years the international community will need to\r\nhave resolved all the obstacles to achieving a\r\nmultigenerational society which guarantees dignity and\r\nusefulness for older persons, integrating them into the\r\nfabric of society.\r\nThe task ahead will be a very difficult one: in a few\r\nmore years, the United Nations programme on ageing will\r\nprobably need to take on the scale and visibility enjoyed\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nby other agencies in the system today if there is to be an\r\neffective response to this challenge. At the global, national\r\nand local levels, education, the market, health and all social\r\nactors must have accepted older persons as useful agents\r\nfor development.\r\nToday the question of older persons which was\r\nbrought to the United Nations 51 years ago has become a\r\nmuch larger issue: the International Year is proof.\r\nArgentina is involved in the Year through a number of\r\ninitiatives, some of which were mentioned in paragraph 10\r\nof the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/268). Argentina\r\nis particularly concerned about the effects of poverty on\r\nolder persons. Among other activities, the national plan for\r\nolder persons is assisting almost half a million poor older\r\npersons by providing food supplements, group outings,\r\nsubsidies and medicines. The Probienestar wellness\r\nprogramme, geriatric programmes and economic subsidies\r\nof the National Institute for Social Security for Retirees and\r\nPensioners and the Programme for Solidarity Assistance for\r\nOlder Persons run by the Department of Social\r\nDevelopment are other current initiatives.\r\nToday, this challenge concerns all countries. Argentina\r\nsupports the proposal to hold a Second World Assembly on\r\nAgeing 20 years after the first great world summit on\r\nageing, in 1982. We are happy to support Spain’s effort —\r\na country which we wish to thank for the cooperation it has\r\nprovided for Argentina in this field — to have the Second\r\nWorld Assembly on Ageing in that country.\r\nWhen the International Year is over, the work must\r\nstill go on. As Ambassador Julia Alvarez of the Dominican\r\nRepublic has so rightly said — and we do wish to\r\nrecognize her clear-sightedness, dedication and efforts — it\r\nis to be hoped that we will have the determination and\r\nvision to ensure that on 31 December, the older persons\r\nwill at last occupy their proper place on the world map.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran): I\r\nam honoured to address the General Assembly on this item.\r\nI should like to associate my delegation with the statement\r\nby the Permanent Representative of Guyana speaking on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77.\r\nI commend the Secretary-General for his report\r\n(A/54/268) on this agenda item, and the Secretariat for the\r\nconsiderable efforts it has made for the observance of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons.\r\nThe ageing of populations and the increase in the\r\nnumber of elderly throughout the world which are the\r\nresults of medical, hygienic, scientific and educational\r\nachievements are phenomena of the late twentieth century.\r\nThis new development is producing changes in all aspects\r\nof community life, aspects such as the age structure,\r\nvalues, norms and institutions of societies at the global\r\nlevel.\r\nThe number of people aged 65 or over in 2025 is\r\nprojected to be 828 million, which is more than two and\r\na half times the 328 million figure for 1990. Although at\r\npresent the greying of the population is more an issue in\r\nindustrial countries, Asia too will be faced with a major\r\nageing population group in the near future, so that by\r\n2025 nearly 56 per cent of the world’s over-60 population\r\nof 1,181 million will live in Asia.\r\nSince there is a difference in longevity between the\r\nsexes — women generally live longer than men in nearly\r\nevery part of the world, as the Secretary-General refers\r\nnotes in his recent report to the General Assembly —\r\nwomen constitute a majority of the elderly population.\r\nDespite the vast opportunities created by advances in\r\ntechnology, which have improved the quality of life of\r\npeople at the global level, economic inequality has,\r\nunfortunately, been magnified and the number of people\r\nliving in poverty — especially in developing countries —\r\nhas dramatically increased. In this regard, elderly poor\r\nwomen are especially vulnerable, and therefore particular\r\nattention has to be paid to their needs in any welfare\r\nprogramme schemed for the elderly population.\r\nThis year, the core theme of the substantive session\r\nof the Economic and Social Council, held in Geneva in\r\nJuly, was devoted to poverty eradication and the\r\nempowerment and advancement of women. In the\r\nministerial communiqué adopted at that session it was\r\nemphasized that in any strategies to eradicate poverty, the\r\nempowerment of women in particular was a prerequisite\r\nfor effective poverty eradication and that the international\r\ncommunity had a key role to play in supporting efforts to\r\neradicate poverty.\r\nIn many developing countries, particularly in the\r\nAsian region, family support is considered the norm and\r\npeople traditionally believe that family can provide the\r\nbest emotional and economic support for older persons.\r\nHowever, this practice is gradually weakening as a\r\nconsequence of individualization, urbanization and the\r\nprevalence of a more nuclear family system. Therefore, in\r\naddition to family support, other sources of active\r\ninvolvement by Governments and various institutions of\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\ncivil society — including the private sector and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — should be invited to\r\ncontribute to the formulation and implementation of policies\r\nand programmes for older people.\r\nAlthough the Islamic Republic of Iran has a young\r\npopulation and the percentage of older persons above 60\r\nyears of age is not more than 6 per cent of the total\r\npopulation, my country nevertheless supports the common\r\ninternational framework established by the United Nations\r\nto promote the status of the elderly and is committed to\r\nsupporting their rights, to utilizing their experiences and to\r\nproviding them with adequate social security, including\r\npension and health-care services. This conviction of ours\r\nstems from numerous recommendations of the Holy Koran\r\nfor the respect, care and protection of parents and older\r\npersons. Also on the basis of our cultural and religious\r\nvalues, older persons, while protected by the family, are\r\nconstantly being consulted on important family issues,\r\nwhich ensures their dignity.\r\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran, the national welfare\r\norganization supports the elderly at the country level and\r\nprovides them with welfare services. That organization,\r\nwith its 63 centres, provides hospitalization and other\r\naccommodation to guardianless elderly people throughout\r\nthe country. Also, the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee\r\nhas a special responsibility to provide basic needs and\r\nservices to elderly persons who do not have any family.\r\nWith regard to our national commitments to support\r\nthe United Nations common framework for the promotion\r\nof the status of the elderly, several measures have been\r\ntaken in my country for the betterment of the quality of life\r\nof older persons, inter alia, the raising of community\r\nawareness in this regard. Some of the measures taken are\r\nas follows.\r\nInformation and education campaigns on ageing to\r\npromote positive images of ageing are launched every year\r\nwith the close collaboration of associations of retired\r\npersons on the occasion of the International Day of Older\r\nPersons, on 1 October.\r\nIn line with the commemoration of the United Nations\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, a number of seminars\r\non the problems of the elderly have been organized, books\r\nand articles have been published and movies, films and\r\nradio and television programmes have been produced.\r\nOur first international conference on ageing is going\r\nto be held this month. That conference is sponsored by the\r\nLadies\u0027 Charitable Society, an active Iranian\r\nnon-governmental organization affiliated with the\r\nKahrizak Home for the Disabled and the Elderly, which\r\nhas special consultative status with the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. The objective of the conference is to\r\nbring experts together from all over the world to\r\nexchange ideas, expertise and experience on issues related\r\nto the elderly.\r\nSince ageing will be one of the major demographic,\r\nsocial, health and economic issues of the next millennium\r\nand needs to be confronted with great efficacy and timely\r\nplanning, the gathering and exchange of information and\r\nknowledge between the Member States and international\r\norganizations, as was recommended in the Vienna\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing, while ensuring\r\nthe ongoing process of paying special attention to the\r\nsituation of the older persons at the global level, would\r\nalso help strengthen the bonds between the older and\r\nyounger generations with a view to deriving benefit from\r\nthe experience and cultural heritage of older persons. In\r\nthis regard, the Islamic Republic of Iran fully supports the\r\nsuggestions for the development of a long-term-\r\nperspective strategy on ageing for the twenty-first century.\r\nAnnouncement\r\nThe President: I draw the attention of the Assembly\r\nto a matter concerning the maintenance of order in the\r\nAssembly Hall. Despite previous letters and appeals by\r\nmy predecessors, numerous delegations are still letting\r\ncellular phones ring in the General Assembly Hall and in\r\nconference rooms while meetings are in progress. It is\r\nobvious that the ringing of telephones while debates or\r\ndiscussions are ongoing is disruptive of the orderly\r\nproceedings of the meetings. I urge representatives and\r\nother members of delegations to turn cellular telephones\r\noff or keep them in silent mode while in the General\r\nAssembly Hall or in a conference room and a meeting is\r\nin progress.\r\nI am very serious about this matter and I may be\r\nforced to name non-compliant delegations should this\r\nrenewed appeal be ignored.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
