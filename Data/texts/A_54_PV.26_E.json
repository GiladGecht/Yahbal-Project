(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Jordán-Pando\r\n(Bolivia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 106 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family: follow-up to the International\r\nYear of Older Persons\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/268)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.6)\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): Allow me at the\r\noutset to express my support for the statement made on\r\nMonday by the representative of Guyana on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. I also wish to commend\r\nAmbassador Julia Alvarez of the Dominican Republic for\r\nher untiring efforts in support of the United Nations agenda\r\nfor older persons.\r\nAs we focus on the theme of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons, “Towards a society for all ages”, we are\r\nstruck by its unifying nature. “Towards a society for all\r\nages” clearly must embrace the notion of communities in\r\nwhich every member contributes to growth and prosperity.\r\nIt must involve both young and old, and it must\r\nacknowledge the socio-economic changes affecting the\r\nability of our countries to achieve the sustainable\r\ndevelopment inherent in “a society for all ages”.\r\nOlder persons have traditionally served as a bonding\r\nagent for the immediate and extended family. The 1982\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing supports this\r\nintergenerational role by noting that throughout history,\r\nolder persons have educated the younger and passed on\r\nvalues to them, a role that ensured humanity’s survival\r\nand progress. Today many of our countries, particularly\r\ndeveloping countries, struggle to retain these and similar\r\nbonds of tradition in the face of fewer development\r\ndollars, trends in migration and, perhaps most\r\nsignificantly, the onslaught of globalization.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda’s 1991 Population and Housing\r\nCensus revealed that persons in the age group of 65 years\r\nand over made up 8.2 per cent of the population. I wish\r\nhere, at this plenary meeting of the General Assembly\r\ncommemorating the International Year of Older Persons,\r\n1999, to pay homage to the contributions that these\r\ncitizens have made to the building of our nation.\r\nWe acknowledge the significance of these\r\ncontributions with pride. However, it is with a measure of\r\ndisquiet that we must admit that the protection of this\r\nsignificant number of older persons has presented a\r\nchallenge to the existing social and health services of\r\nAntigua and Barbuda. This challenge becomes even more\r\nacute when one considers the changes previously referred\r\nto in family structure and the gradual breakdown of the\r\ncommunity support systems which existed in the past.\r\nThe net result is that many older persons are living alone\r\nwith minimal financial support and without assistance to\r\ncomplete basic household and other tasks. Those\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nchallenges notwithstanding, Antigua and Barbuda earnestly\r\nbegan to implement the 1982 International Plan of Action\r\nwithin its own national context.\r\nOur country marked the beginning of the International\r\nYear on 1 October 1998. An awareness campaign was\r\nlaunched right at the outset, utilizing print and the\r\nelectronic media to dispel many myths about and\r\nstereotypes of elders. Elders were included in all aspects of\r\nour independence activities in November; those who\r\nparticipated in the Independence Food Fair were awarded\r\nprizes for their contributions. From January to March 1999,\r\nan initiative to reconnect generations was launched, and it\r\nwas observed with various activities throughout the year.\r\nDuring World Health Week in April, individual villages\r\nhanded out honours to older persons who have remained\r\nactive in their community. Also in April a national\r\nconsultation began under the theme “active ageing makes\r\na difference”. The theme for this October’s health fair is,\r\n“Active, healthy living and ageing”. Some of the issues\r\nbeing discussed during the fair include nutrition, disease,\r\nsex and the elderly, HIV/AIDS, general health care and\r\ncare for the mentally challenged elderly. Studies are\r\ncurrently being carried out by the Gender Affairs Division\r\nof the Ministry of Health and Social Improvement on the\r\nprovision of free electricity and water services for persons\r\n80 years of age and over.\r\nIn August 1990 the Citizen’s Welfare Division\r\nconducted a needs analysis survey among older persons.\r\nThe survey revealed that — regardless of social or\r\neconomic status - loneliness and neglect were the main\r\nproblems confronting older persons in Antigua and\r\nBarbuda. They were followed closely by the need for\r\nassistance with household tasks, such as food preparation,\r\ncleaning and personal hygiene. Limited financial resources\r\nand poor housing were also identified as compelling\r\nproblems. In order to best address the needs of the older\r\nsegment of the population, the Government determined that\r\nit was necessary to enact legislation that could support the\r\nsocial welfare policy and facilitate programme\r\nimplementation for both Government and non-governmental\r\nagencies. This was accomplished with a draft policy on\r\nageing based on the proposed Caribbean charter on health\r\nand ageing, a draft of which was developed in Nassau, the\r\nBahamas, in May 1998.\r\nOne of the main components of Antigua and\r\nBarbuda’s draft policy on ageing was created out of the\r\nawareness that life expectancy cannot be separated from the\r\nenjoyment of good health. In this regard, several\r\nGovernment programmes have been identified to provide\r\nhealth services to the elderly. Outreach clinics, district\r\ndoctors, the medical benefits scheme and the social\r\nsecurity scheme are but a few of them.\r\nPrivate agencies and institutions also play an active\r\nrole in the care of older persons. The Board of Guardians\r\nprovides a bimonthly stipend for those people 60 years of\r\nage and over who do not receive a pension. The\r\nGovernment collaborates regularly with such private\r\nagencies and institutions. The Antigua and Barbuda\r\nAssociation for the Welfare of Senior Citizens, for\r\nexample, has recently acquired land from the Government\r\nand will soon start fund-raising activities for the\r\nconstruction of a centre.\r\nThe Citizen’s Welfare Division has recognized the\r\nneed to fill the gaps in the service needs of the physically\r\nhealthy, yet vulnerable, elderly. To assist in bridging\r\nthose gaps, the Government started a home help service\r\nin 1988 by which people are trained to provide health-\r\ncare services in the homes of elders. The recipients are\r\nassessed according to age, mental and health status,\r\nmobility and disabilities, nutritional state, hygienic state\r\nand environmental and social conditions. An attendant\r\nprogramme, the welfare aides service, was established in\r\n1990. That programme was developed to focus on\r\nmeeting the social, recreational, emotional and even some\r\nof the spiritual needs of older persons. That programme\r\nis coordinated by the chief welfare officer.\r\nThe main goal of such programmes as the home help\r\nworkers and the welfare aides service programmes is to\r\nmaintain older persons in their homes and communities\r\nfor as long as possible by meeting their personal care\r\nneeds, thereby helping to relieve some of the loneliness\r\nand stress that elder participants have themselves\r\nidentified as a main concern of their generation.\r\nAs was demonstrated in the twenty-second special\r\nsession which recently concluded, small island developing\r\nStates have particular vulnerabilities that affect all\r\nmembers of our societies, regardless of age. Because of\r\nour annual brush with potentially devastating natural\r\ndisasters, the Citizen’s Welfare Division and the National\r\nOffice of Disaster Services have been working closely to\r\nensure that the homes of older persons who may not be\r\nable to make requests themselves are included in the\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction phase following a\r\nhurricane or other natural disaster. Due to the frequency\r\nof such storms, that is one of the single most important\r\nexamples of collaboration that exists in support of the\r\nelders of our community.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nIn conclusion, the wisdom contained in the\r\nInternational Plan of Action remains as relevant today as it\r\nwas almost two decades ago. It states that the presence of\r\nthe elderly in the family home, the neighbourhood and in\r\nall forms of social life still teaches an irreplaceable lesson\r\nof humanity.\r\nWe believe in those lessons of patience, respect and\r\nhonour, and we know that if we are to add life to the years\r\nthat have been added to life, we must continue to find ways\r\nto enable elders to play vital, contributing roles in their\r\ncommunities and thereby reclaim those valuable lessons of\r\nhumanity.\r\nMr. Babar (Pakistan): My delegation associates itself\r\nwith the statement on the International Year of Older\r\nPersons made by the Permanent Representative of Guyana\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe international community has been conscious of the\r\nsilent revolution which the phenomenon of ageing is likely\r\nto bring about in the population structure of the world in\r\nthe next century. The Vienna World Assembly on Ageing\r\nin 1982 was a recognition at the international level of the\r\nfact that the ageing of the population would not only affect\r\nthe developed countries but also have an impact on the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe celebration of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, as we stand on the threshold of the new\r\nmillennium, provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the\r\nlikely impact of this impending demographic revolution on\r\nvarious societies and to develop appropriate strategies to\r\nmeet that challenge.\r\nIn his report entitled “International Year of Older\r\nPersons, 1999: activities and legacies” (A/54/268), the\r\nSecretary-General has given details of activities which the\r\nUnited Nations system, regional intergovernmental\r\norganizations, national Governments and non-governmental\r\norganizations have undertaken throughout the Year to\r\npromote public understanding of its theme, “Towards a\r\nsociety for all ages”. These activities have helped to\r\nconsiderably enhance global awareness about this issue.\r\nFortunately, unlike many other challenges, the ageing\r\nof the population is predictable in its timing and its\r\nmagnitude, which have already been identified. The elderly\r\nof the next century have already been born. Projections\r\nindicate that by 2050 the number of people aged 65 and\r\nbeyond worldwide will grow from 426 million to 1.47\r\nbillion. The phenomenon of ageing has been more\r\npronounced in developed countries, where reduced\r\nfertility together with declining mortality has transformed\r\nthe age structure of populations. It is anticipated that by\r\n2030 almost every third person in developed countries\r\nwill be over 60 years of age. This will have an impact on\r\nthe patterns of labour migration as well as on the\r\neconomic and political policies of developed countries.\r\nThe ageing of the population in the industrialized\r\ncountries has taken more than a century. This process is\r\nexpected to occur much more rapidly in the developing\r\ncountries. However, in view of certain negative\r\ndevelopments in the developing world, particularly in the\r\nAfrican continent, where life expectancy has in fact\r\ndeclined, we need to further refine our projections.\r\nCoupled with the adverse effects of widespread and\r\npervasive poverty, the phenomenon of ageing will have\r\nfar-reaching implications for the efforts of developing\r\ncountries to achieve the sustained economic growth and\r\nsocial development which are fundamental for ensuring a\r\nbetter quality of life for the entire population.\r\nPakistan is fully conscious of the challenge of the\r\nageing of the population. As a country 40 per cent of\r\nwhose population are in their teens, we are likely to be\r\naffected more acutely by this phenomenon. Pakistan\r\nlaunched its activities for the International Year of Older\r\nPersons on 1 October 1998.\r\nThe Government has taken various steps to ensure\r\nthat older people continue to participate actively in the\r\nsocial, economic and political life of the country. As part\r\nof this effort, the Government has announced a package\r\nof benefits for elderly people, and is currently working on\r\na comprehensive medicare package for older persons to\r\nensure that they can enjoy a healthy life.\r\nNotwithstanding the various steps being undertaken\r\nby the Government for the welfare and care of older\r\npersons, it is the family which remains the institution that\r\nmust shoulder the responsibility for the care and welfare\r\nof older people in Pakistani society.\r\nThe increasing pressures of modern life and rapid\r\nurbanization are putting strains on traditional informal\r\nsupport structures in Pakistan. The Government is\r\nendeavouring to assist in adapting these support structures\r\nto the new demands of urbanization. We will continue to\r\nstrengthen the social support base for the elderly in our\r\nsociety. We also hope to gain from the experience of\r\nother countries and societies in this area through regular\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\ninteraction among the members of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French): My delegation\r\nis grateful for the opportunity to speak on this agenda item.\r\nI associate myself with the views set out by Ambassador\r\nInsanally of Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nThe observance of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons falls at the end of a cycle and at the dawn of a new\r\nera. We in Benin have a proverb: “It is at the end of the\r\nold cord that you knot the new”. This means that the social\r\nmicrocosm depends on continuity and on change; there is\r\nno break in it, and no exclusion. That is why we welcome\r\nthe stress the Year has placed on building a “society for all\r\nages\".\r\nIn the culture of Benin, as in those of many other\r\nAfrican countries, long life is viewed as a sign of divine\r\ngrace; indeed, the funeral of an elderly person is an\r\noccasion for celebration. It is on the basis of our African\r\nexperience that we are participating in this debate and\r\nmaking our contribution on the situation of older persons in\r\nthe context of assessing the International Year of Older\r\nPersons.\r\nThe ageing of the world population should not take us\r\nby surprise. It is simply the result of scientific and\r\ntechnological progress by humans; these scientific,\r\ntechnological and medical advances have been aimed, inter\r\nalia, at fulfilling the universal human dream of longer life.\r\nWe should rather focus on the impoverishment, increasing\r\nmarginalization and exclusion brought about by our socio-\r\neconomic development choices, and thus take greater\r\naccount of the social and human dimensions of\r\ndevelopment if we want that development to be sustainable.\r\nIn Africa in general, and in Benin in particular, older\r\npersons enjoy high esteem. Not only are they a repository\r\nof experience which society constantly draws on, but they\r\nare also the ultimate recourse for easing social tensions\r\nwhen these reach the breaking point. In Benin, as in many\r\nother African countries in which the majority of the\r\npopulation is rural, ageing is active ageing, although it must\r\nbe acknowledged that it is certainly less productive, since\r\nthe rural exodus is the sphere of younger people.\r\nHence, the problem of older persons cannot be seen\r\nbasically in terms of an intergenerational dialogue, inclusion\r\nand participation in the community by older persons. It is\r\nmore a question of the dignity that is inherent in their age,\r\nand of the fulfilment they have a right to expect; these are\r\nthreatened by the effects of extreme poverty and the\r\nbreakup of the social fabric caused by the armed conflicts\r\nand fratricidal wars that have destroyed the network of\r\nsolidarity that guarded against risks of all kinds. The\r\nsituation of older women is a source of even greater\r\nconcern, because they suffer from a twofold handicap:\r\nthey are women and they are older persons.\r\nBecause of these facts, Benin, where 7 per cent of\r\nthe population consists of older persons, has established\r\na Ministry of Social Protection and the Family, whose\r\ngoals for the International Year of Older Persons\r\nincluded: strengthening the ability of older persons to take\r\ncontrol of their lives; conducting a nationwide study on\r\nthe situation of older persons; the establishment of\r\ngeriatric centres in hospitals; and technical and financial\r\nsupport for income-generating projects for older persons.\r\nGrass-roots capacity-building to increase the\r\nautonomy of rural communities; promoting microcredits\r\nto increase income; the adoption of laws on land\r\nownership; and ensuring that basic needs are met in a\r\ngeneralized and fair manner with a view to strengthening\r\ncommunity and family security systems: we view these as\r\nmeasures that should be addressed at a 2002 World\r\nAssembly on Ageing if we want to build a society in\r\nwhich individuals of all ages can live in harmony.\r\nMs. Morgan-Moss (Panama) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe delegation of Panama endorses the statement\r\ndelivered by the delegate from Guyana, who spoke on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China on the issue of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. We would like, in\r\nour turn, to report to the Assembly on the policies we\r\nhave developed in our country for implementing the\r\nrecommendations of the World Assembly on Ageing, held\r\nin Vienna in 1982.\r\nPanama thanks the Secretary-General for his report\r\non the subject of ageing. It identifies priority areas and\r\nthe situation at the global and regional levels, along with\r\nthe impact that this will have in the future on the world’s\r\npeoples.\r\nThe total population of Panama amounts to\r\n2,809,280 for the year 1999, of which 224,403 are older\r\npersons. According to the 1990 census, this figure\r\nrepresents 7.6 per cent of our population. By the year\r\n2000, the percentage will rise to 8.1.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nIn our country, the population of older persons reflects\r\nthe pattern typical of our part of the world; rapid growth as\r\nreflected by the census data for the seventies, eighties and\r\nnineties, with a substantial and sustained rise into the new\r\nmillennium. The low infant mortality rate, decline in the\r\nfertility rate, declining birth rates and increasing life\r\nexpectancies are creating this phenomenon.\r\nWomen begin to outnumber men as they get older\r\nbecause of the higher mortality rate for men at more\r\nadvanced ages. The proportion is three widows for every\r\nwidower. The belief is that one of the reasons for the\r\ndifferences in mortality between men and women is the\r\ngeneral tendency of men to run greater health risks, while\r\nwomen have more prevention-oriented behaviour and go to\r\nthe doctor more often than do men, resulting in longer life\r\nexpectancy.\r\nLife expectancy for Panamanian citizens is estimated\r\nto be 72.5 years, and it is expected that for the five-year\r\nperiod 1995-2000 it will be 73.3. Currently women have a\r\nlife expectancy at birth of 74.1 in the cities and 69.9 in the\r\ncountryside. The Panamanian population, though it has\r\nremained young in structure, reflects a slight but sustained\r\nageing trend. The average age of Panamanians is 22 years.\r\nPanama has entered into a variety of commitments as\r\nit has participated in various international events in the\r\nperiod from 1990 through 1999; these have served as tools\r\nand guidelines in designing plans, programmes and policies\r\ngeared towards older persons. These are being driven by the\r\nMinistry of Youth, Women, Children and the Family\r\nthrough the National Council on Older Persons, created by\r\nvirtue of Decree-Law No. 23 of 24 June 1999.\r\nTo commemorate the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, activities such as literary contests, parades and a\r\nvariety of cultural events have been developed, with\r\nhighlights such as the Week of Older Persons from 16\r\nthrough 20 November, teachers’ conferences, the national\r\nmeeting of retired persons and pensioners, nationwide talks\r\non ageing and information, education and communications\r\ncampaigns on ageing. The preparation, adoption and\r\npromulgation of a decree-law establishing a single\r\nnationwide set of rules to govern centres and nursing homes\r\nfor older persons was very important.\r\nPublicizing the principles developed by the United\r\nNations for the benefit of older persons, research on risk\r\nfactors impairing the functional autonomy of older adults,\r\nthe Flower Games for Seniors organized by the Social\r\nSecurity Administration and the Ministry of Youth, Women,\r\nChildren and the Family from 23 through 26 February of\r\nthis year, training seminars on first aid in May and on\r\ncare and treatment for older persons in August,\r\nintegrating the theme of ageing and working activities\r\nrelated to ageing into national events and\r\ncommemorations such as International Family Day on\r\n15 May and Family Week in June — all these are among\r\nthe many additional ways that the Government of Panama\r\nis seeking to mark and promote the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons.\r\nWe must not let the enormous repercussions of the\r\ndemographic revolution go unnoticed, for it affects every\r\nindividual, family, neighbourhood and nation of the\r\nworld. The organization of society will feel the effects of\r\nthis new reality as the population continues to grow older.\r\nLet us realize that the older population represents a\r\nchallenge for humanity for which we must find a\r\ncommensurate response. As our tireless and admirable\r\nfighter to whom we owe so much, Mrs. Julia Alvarez, the\r\nAmbassador of the Dominican Republic, has said, we will\r\nnot let all these efforts end at the stroke of midnight on\r\n31 December of this year.\r\nMr. Benítez Saénz (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nFirst of all, the delegation of Uruguay appreciates the\r\nreport by the Secretary-General, A/54/268, for its\r\nsweeping overview of the commemoration of 1999 as the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, inspired by the idea\r\nof a society for all ages. We would highlight the efforts\r\nby the Division for Social Policy and Development in the\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs, as well as by\r\nthose in the Commission for Social Development and its\r\nChairman, Mr. Aurelio Fernández, to promote a new\r\nawareness of this issue, as well as their work in preparing\r\nstrategies in concert with Governments, United Nations\r\nagencies, non-governmental organizations and the entire\r\nspectrum of civil society.\r\nMy delegation would like to pay particular tribute to\r\nthe work done by Ambassador Julia Tavares de Álvarez,\r\nwhose conviction and indefatigable commitment have\r\nguided and constantly spurred us on in our work.\r\nThe ageing of the population is a major social\r\nproblem for many countries. The international community\r\nhas progressively become more aware of the impact\r\nwhich this phenomenon is having on societies, on\r\neconomies and on culture in general.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nPhenomena such as a high concentration of the\r\npopulation in the urban centres, the processes of\r\nindustrialization, development of the service sector, a\r\nchange the role of women in the home and in society,\r\ntransformations of the workforce, increased poverty and\r\nmarginalization of some parts of society and an expansion\r\nof the informal sector of employment — all this has\r\nweighed on the question of old age, in the world and in\r\nUruguay.\r\nThese developments have led to a change in the age\r\ndistribution of the population, including a rise in the\r\nproportion of the population that is elderly. In Uruguay,\r\nduring the period 1990-1995 the number of people under 15\r\nyears of age decreased by 2 per cent, whereas the number\r\nof those 65 or older increased by 1.5 per cent. During the\r\nsame period the average life expectancy at birth rose from\r\n70 to 74 years. Further, it is expected that the proportion of\r\nthe adult population over 65 years of age will continue to\r\nincrease, reaching almost 14 per cent of the total population\r\nby the year 2025, and life expectancy at birth will rise to\r\n81 years.\r\nAs with a considerable number of moderately and\r\nhighly developed countries, in Uruguay the transformation\r\nof the population is affecting such fundamental areas as the\r\nstructure of the labour pool, the social security system and\r\nhealth-care systems. In addition, the growth of the older\r\npopulation may lead to changes in production and\r\nconsumption patterns. The implications of these processes\r\nfor the family and for society as a whole are considerable\r\nand unprecedented.\r\nIn preparation for the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, a series of activities was launched in Uruguay. The\r\nfirst was the establishment in 1995 of our National\r\nProgramme of Solidarity with Older Persons. The aim of\r\nthis Programme was to deal with this major public issue in\r\nvarious sectors of the social sphere through an\r\ninterdisciplinary, integral and global approach. The\r\nfundamental goals of the national policy on ageing are to\r\ncreate a national awareness enabling us to recognize the\r\nvalue of older persons and of their integral development,\r\ntheir integration into family and national life, and the\r\npromotion of the concept of productive ageing. It is our\r\nunderstanding that the ageing process of a population is part\r\nof the development of a community; that healthy ageing, in\r\nparticular, allows older persons to play a major role in their\r\nfamilies and in the economy as a whole; and that the\r\nprocess affords opportunities for learning, development and\r\na continuing contribution to society.\r\nWithin this context of preparatory activities, in\r\nAugust 1997 in Montevideo, the Latin American\r\nParliament and the Pan American Health Organization\r\nheld an international forum on ageing. At that forum were\r\n115 representatives from 21 countries of Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean and the United States. They adopted\r\nthe Montevideo declaration, which presented agreed\r\nrecommendations in five specific areas: social security,\r\nhealth protection and promotion, housing and community\r\nservices, productive ageing and intergenerational relations,\r\nand the preparations for the International Year of Older\r\nPersons.\r\nAt the subregional level — following through on the\r\nresolutions adopted in Buenos Aires in December 1997,\r\nat the first meeting on the social aspects of the Southern\r\nCone Common Market (MERCOSUR) — in September\r\n1998 the National Institute for Solidarity with Older\r\nPersons held a seminar on older persons involving the\r\nexchange of regional experiences. Seminar discussions\r\nanalysed the demographics of ageing, social well-being,\r\nprotecting older persons, informal education and\r\nintegrating older persons into communities. Experiences\r\nof intergenerational integration were compared.\r\nIn Uruguay we have recognized the need to increase\r\nawareness of the changes and implications brought on by\r\nan ageing society, because we understand the importance\r\nof striking a proper balance between the legitimate\r\naspirations of the young and those of older persons.\r\nIn the context of the global campaign of postcards\r\nfrom older persons — a campaign organized with a view\r\nto commemorating both the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons — an elderly man\r\nfrom Uruguay wrote,\r\n“No one gets old simply by having lived a certain\r\nnumber of years. You only get old when you\r\nabandon your ideals. The years wrinkle the skin, but\r\nonly the loss of enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.”\r\nWe therefore trust that this special commemoration\r\nof the General Assembly will make a valuable\r\ncontribution to the definition of long-range strategies on\r\nageing, and that the efforts to integrate older persons into\r\na society for all ages will continue.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Before we\r\nhear the next speaker, I would like to propose that the list\r\nof speakers be closed 10 minutes from now.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Sychov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Belarus attaches great\r\nimportance to the activities of the United Nations in the\r\narea of ageing. Protecting and assisting older persons is one\r\nof the basic thrusts of the national social policy of Belarus.\r\nAt present, the total population of the Republic of\r\nBelarus is 10.3 million, of which 2 million are elderly\r\npeople — 988 of them being 100 years of age or older. The\r\nconstant increase in the proportion of the total population\r\nthat is elderly means that we need to improve existing\r\nmechanisms and create new ones for assisting older\r\npersons.\r\nPursuant to the decisions taken by the General\r\nAssembly regarding the observance in 1999 of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, with the slogan,\r\n“Towards a society for all ages”, the Republic of Belarus\r\nestablished a national commission to prepare for the\r\ncommemoration of the Year. This commission was headed\r\nby the Deputy Prime Minister of Belarus. It elaborated and\r\nadopted a plan of basic actions. The main principle of the\r\nplan is the active, direct participation of each ministry,\r\nalong with other national and local organs of State\r\nadministration, businesses, associations and organizations,\r\nin the observance of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons. The basic focus was on practical steps to provide\r\nsocial protection and assistance to older people in the\r\ncountry.\r\nIn order to improve social services for older people we\r\nadopted a plan for social service centres for senior citizens\r\nand the disabled. The main aim of creating these centres is\r\nto provide maximum, comprehensive assistance to these\r\npeople. Houses for social services are being established to\r\nserve people in small, remote areas. Throughout the country\r\nthere are 176 social service centres, which include\r\nsubsidized stores and facilities for medical teams and\r\nhousehold services. Cultural events and meetings of\r\neducational groups and of staff of social service agencies\r\nare held in these centres.\r\nThe legislative basis is being improved for the social\r\nprotection of veterans. The House of Representatives of the\r\nNational Assembly of the Republic of Belarus has heard the\r\nfirst reading of a draft bill of the Republic calling for the\r\nintroduction of changes and additions to the Republic’s law\r\non veterans. A great deal is being done to prepare this draft\r\nbill for consideration in a second reading.\r\nIn the context of measures to commemorate the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, the Government of\r\nBelarus has elaborated a draft programme to support the\r\nRepublic’s national and local veterans’ organizations for\r\nthe period 2000-2005.\r\nIn order to resolve the problem of improving pension\r\ncoverage and the differentiation in pension sizes based on\r\nprevious earnings, in March 1999 a decree was adopted\r\nby the President of the Republic of Belarus on additional\r\nmeasures to improve pension coverage for citizens. As a\r\nresult of the implementation of the decree, the level of\r\npension coverage has risen for over one third of\r\npensioners.\r\nIn the context of events to commemorate the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, a geriatric service\r\nhas been organized in Belarus and a laboratory\r\nestablished for the medical and social problems of the\r\nelderly. A Republican Gerontology Centre has also been\r\nestablished and a public institute known as Health for the\r\nElderly is now functioning. A seminar was also held on\r\nthe role of the mass media in creating a healthy lifestyle.\r\nIn preparation for the International Year, a statistical\r\nreference book, entitled Older Persons in the Republic of\r\nBelarus, was published.\r\nIt is important to note that, in resolving the problem\r\nof social protection for the elderly, local executive and\r\nadministrative organs have cooperated very closely with\r\npublic organizations for veterans and the disabled, the\r\ncharitable fund, the committees of the Red Cross and\r\ntrade unions.\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus agrees\r\nwith the section of the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nresponsibility of Governments and on choosing one’s own\r\napproach to implementing in practical terms the concept\r\nof a society for all ages. We believe that older persons\r\nare the pride and wealth of a country; in the future, we\r\nwill help to meet their most vital needs.\r\nThe Government of Belarus reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the United Nations principles for older\r\npersons and its willingness to contribute to the\r\nOrganization’s future activities on the outcome of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons in order to implement\r\nthe concept of a society for all ages.\r\nMrs. Fouda (Cameroon) (spoke in French): My\r\ncountry is delighted to have this opportunity to participate\r\nin the debate on such an important topic. This is a\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nquestion that concerns us all, since it pertains to a period of\r\nlife during which we are particularly vulnerable, just as we\r\nare in our earliest years when we need more assistance and\r\nthe support of a helping hand.\r\nAware of the importance of this subject, the General\r\nAssembly decided in its resolution 33/52 of 14 December\r\n1978 to organize a World Assembly on Ageing to launch\r\nan International Plan of Action to ensure the economic and\r\nsocial security of the elderly and to enable them to continue\r\nto contribute to social development.\r\nAs I stressed in February at a meeting of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, the problem of\r\nold age has a very strong cultural dimension that can be\r\nseen in different ways depending on a country’s cultures\r\nand traditions. In traditional Africa, old age is the beautiful\r\nage. The elderly are considered to be wise and are\r\nvenerated as the repositories of ancestral wisdom, the\r\nguardians of our customs and traditions, and the regulators\r\nof the daily life of clans and families. Young people learn\r\nabout life from them. Their death is generally considered to\r\nbe a great loss to the community. Do we not say, after all,\r\nthat an old person who dies is a library that has burned\r\ndown?\r\nThe central and in many respects enviable role of the\r\nelderly in traditional African society defines the way they\r\nare treated by other members of the family or clan. The\r\nolder person generally grows within the family circle,\r\nwhere he or she enjoys the affection of the family and\r\nbenefits from its constant assistance. Rendering such\r\nassistance is considered to be a sacred duty and members\r\nof the younger generation are happy to do so out of\r\ngratitude for the care they have received. In traditional\r\nsociety, and in our African understanding, the elderly are\r\nnaturally integrated into the family environment, where they\r\nreceive their children and grandchildren and the care and\r\nwelfare that their advanced age and economic inactivity\r\nrequire.\r\nThe customs of Cameroonian society do not provide\r\nfor an older person’s being separated from the family\r\nenvironment to be placed in an institution or retirement\r\nhome. On the contrary, the retirement into isolation that is\r\ndictated by socio-economic considerations in the West is\r\nseen in Africa as the result of the family’s or community’s\r\ndereliction of its age-old duties and obligations. In\r\nCameroon, which has over 15 million inhabitants, the\r\nelderly make up 6 per cent of the population and will\r\naccount for 10 per cent by 2050, according to the estimates\r\nof the United Nations Population Fund.\r\nDespite the existence of the family structure, which\r\nbasically provides the context for managing that segment\r\nof the population, it should be noted that the dependent\r\nstatus of the elderly is already being felt. Because of\r\nurbanization, apartments are growing smaller and more\r\ncostly. Many children do not live with their parents and\r\nthe elderly no longer cultivate the land with their children\r\nbecause of the reduction of jobs through structural\r\nadjustment policies.\r\nAlthough the problem of an ageing population in\r\nCameroon has not yet become as acute as it is in some\r\ncountries, my Government has nevertheless established a\r\npolicy on ageing that integrates the need to prepare young\r\npeople to live an active old age. With respect to rules and\r\nregulations, practical steps for protecting older persons\r\nhave been prepared in various codes regulating social life.\r\nIn the Civil Code, based on the Napoleonic Code, the\r\nobligation to assist and support parents is imposed on\r\ntheir children. In the Penal Code, neglect, exploitation and\r\nabandonment of dependent elders are punishable. In the\r\nWork Code, a retirement pension is a legal right.\r\nThese regulations are supplemented by various\r\nsocial, health, administrative and cultural measures. The\r\nGovernment, through its many social welfare activities, is\r\ntrying to improve the well-being of the elderly by\r\nproviding material and psycho-social assistance. With\r\nrespect to health care, geriatric services have been\r\nestablished in certain health agencies. With respect to\r\nadministration, a special service has been created to\r\nprotect and reintegrate the elderly under the Department\r\nof National Solidarity of the Ministry for Social Affairs.\r\nCertain traditional chiefs have the status of auxiliary\r\npublic administration officials, whereas other, more\r\nexperienced people play the role of resourcers in the day-\r\nto-day management of communal life and in certain legal\r\njurisdictions, where they serve as assessors.\r\nCulturally, a literacy programme was set up for the\r\nelderly, known as “The school under the tree”. This\r\nsuccessful programme, which is oriented more towards\r\nrural populations, seeks to improve the reading and\r\nwriting abilities of people in this age group. All the\r\narrangements that I have described are based on\r\nCameroonian traditions, which encourage keeping older\r\npeople in the family environment. Non-governmental\r\norganizations and other associations also use this\r\nenvironment to improve the well-being of these people.\r\nMy country has already provided some facilities to ensure\r\nthe well-being of abandoned old people — for example\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nBethany Viacam Centre, the Home of the Immaculate Heart\r\nof Mary and the works of Mother Teresa’s Sisters of\r\nCharity, all located on the outskirts of Yaoundé.\r\nProperly combining tradition and modernity to\r\nconfront the problems of ageing is a real challenge for\r\ndeveloping countries such as mine, which must also fight\r\nwidespread poverty. Accordingly, international solidarity is\r\nabsolutely imperative. My country is therefore happy to\r\nhave this opportunity to participate in the debate on this\r\nimportant item. It is a matter which concerns us all, dealing\r\nwith a period of life when we are particularly vulnerable,\r\na period similar to the one when we took our first steps and\r\nneeded assistance and a helping hand.\r\nMr. Kasanda (Zambia): My delegation associates\r\nitself with the statement made by Ambassador Insanally,\r\nPermanent Representative of the Republic of Guyana to the\r\nUnited Nations, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThis statement adequately expressed the positions on social\r\ndevelopment, including the world social situation in general\r\nand the situation of older persons in particular.\r\nI also welcome the statement made by the Deputy\r\nSecretary-General on Monday to this Assembly regarding\r\nthe commemoration of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons in 1999. I confirm my Government’s strong\r\nappreciation of the efforts of the United Nations in\r\npreparing for the Year, as reflected in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/54/268), which my delegation found\r\nmost helpful. The International Year of Older Persons has\r\nprovided us with an opportunity to appreciate the\r\ncontributions of older persons to human development.\r\nDuring this Year media attention was drawn to the activities\r\nand the situation of older persons, and in particular to the\r\nconditions under which they live.\r\nMy Government has long recognized the important\r\nrole social development plays in economic and human\r\ndevelopment. Indeed, the fight against unemployment,\r\nsocial disintegration and poverty cannot be fully meaningful\r\nunless measures are taken at the international, regional and,\r\nindeed, national levels to adequately address the socio-\r\neconomic problems which are inevitably associated with\r\nsocial development. We are convinced that through these\r\nmeasures we will be responding to the situation of youths,\r\nageing disabled persons and the family, as outlined in the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted by the\r\nUnited Nations World Summit for Social Development,\r\nconvened at Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995.\r\nThe commemoration of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons in 1999 is, therefore, a welcome\r\ndevelopment, it is because of the foresight and\r\ncommitment of the older persons of today that the world\r\nenjoys the high levels of human development that we\r\nknow. Older persons shaped the present century, and\r\nthanks to their wisdom, humankind can collectively, as\r\nwe complete the last year of the twentieth century,\r\nconfront with confidence the challenges of the third\r\nmillennium.\r\nIn spite of the acknowledged achievements and\r\ncontributions of older persons to modern civilization, the\r\nworld does not appear to have paid much attention to\r\ntheir specific needs and roles. With due regard to the\r\ndisparities that exist between the developing and the\r\ndeveloped countries, there is a need to allocate adequate\r\nresources to programmes and institutions serving older\r\npersons in all countries. The situation of older persons is\r\nmade even worse by the gap between the rich and the\r\npoor within a given society. Older persons are in certain\r\ncases still viewed in many countries as a burden rather\r\nthan the asset that they are.\r\nThe Zambian Government, in commemorating 1999\r\nas the International Year of Older Persons, undertook\r\nseveral projects to strengthen institutional capacities for\r\nthe aged, including the rehabilitation of homes for the\r\naged. The Department of Social Welfare in the Ministry\r\nof Community Development and Social Services\r\nmobilized material and financial resources in support of\r\naged persons in the care of both Government agencies\r\nand non-governmental organizations. Large quantities of\r\nfoodstuffs and clothing were provided to older persons in\r\nthese institutions.\r\nThe Government of Zambia also marked the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons by focusing attention\r\non the contributions made by older persons in our country\r\nto national development. In this regard, national awards\r\nwere given to deserving individuals at a colourful\r\nceremony held at State House in Lusaka.\r\nWhile Governments strive to improve the situation\r\nof older persons, it is important that the United Nations,\r\nthrough the appropriate agencies, continue to provide the\r\nnecessary coordination in the full implementation of the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted by the\r\nUnited Nations World Summit for Social Development,\r\nwhich addressed the issues of ageing in the context of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nMr. Stanislaus (Grenada): It is right, fitting and\r\nproper that one of the highlights of the turn of the century\r\nand the beginning of a new millennium should be to focus\r\non the International Year of Older Persons, some in the\r\ntwilight and others in the sunset of their lives.\r\nThe great English philosopher and jurist, Sir Francis\r\nBacon, in one of his essays in 1605, glorified age or the\r\nelderly in the following way: “Age is best in four ways: old\r\nwood the best to burn, old wine the best to drink, old books\r\nthe best to read, and old friends the best to keep.” This\r\nphilosophical perception of age is very comforting and\r\nindeed inspiring to the ears of older persons like myself,\r\nnow on the cusp of my eightieth year, still holding on to\r\nthe belief that instead of adding years to my life, I am\r\nadding life to my years.\r\nIt is in this spirit, therefore, and with this in mind, that\r\nmy delegation greets, salutes and congratulates Ambassador\r\nJulia Álvarez, of the Dominican Republic, for her\r\ninvaluable contribution and for her championing and\r\nworking so assiduously to promote the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations Programme of Action on Ageing in\r\ncelebration of the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nIt might be useful from a historical perspective to\r\nhighlight the evolutionary process leading to the\r\nInternational Year. The international community first\r\ndebated the question of ageing in 1948 at the United\r\nNations, on the initiative of Argentina. In 1969 Malta again\r\nraised the issue, and in 1982 the United Nations convened\r\nthe World Assembly on Ageing in Vienna. This was\r\nfollowed later that year by the United Nations endorsement\r\nof the International Plan of Action on Ageing; and in 1990,\r\n1 October was designated the International Day of Older\r\nPersons. On 16 December 1991, the United Nations\r\nPrinciples for Older Persons were adopted by the General\r\nAssembly and organized into the following five clusters:\r\nfirst, independence of thought, action and movement of\r\nolder persons; secondly, participation and association by\r\nsharing their knowledge and skills with younger\r\ngenerations; thirdly, care, including health of body and\r\nmind, protection from want, enjoyment of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms; fourthly, self-fulfilment, through\r\neducation, cultural, spiritual and recreational activities; and\r\nfifthly, dignity, by being safe and secure and free from\r\nexploitation, physical or mental abuse, regardless of age,\r\ngender and racial or ethnic background.\r\nMany countries and cultures have adopted these\r\nPrinciples and incorporated them into their national\r\nagendas. My own country, Grenada, with scarce financial\r\nresources, has only recently improved the lives of\r\npensioners by a healthy increase in their monthly\r\nallowance.\r\nIn this celebration of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, the theme of which is “Towards a society for all\r\nages”, we are reminded of the words of Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, who said,\r\n“A society for all is one that does not\r\ncaricature older persons as patients and\r\npensioners. Instead, it sees them as both agents\r\nand beneficiaries of development. It honours\r\ntraditional elders in their leadership and\r\nconsultative roles in communities throughout\r\nthe world”.\r\nThis forward-looking role for older persons contrasts\r\nwith the attitude towards them at the beginning of the\r\ntwentieth century, when life expectancy worldwide was\r\n20 years less than it is today, when older persons with no\r\nfamilies, no employment, no recreation, no social services\r\nand no social security had to fend for themselves in what\r\nshould have been the golden years of their lives. Then it\r\nused to be said that the worst thing that could happen to\r\nsomeone was to be old, poor and sick. President Franklin\r\nD. Roosevelt of the United States immortalized himself,\r\nwhile giving dignity and support to the elderly, by\r\nintroducing the saving net of social security in America.\r\nAge can be both an opportunity and a drag — an\r\nopportunity to share knowledge and experience; a drag\r\nbecause of loneliness and lack of companionship.\r\nHowever, according to the writings of the immortal Plato,\r\nmany centuries before Christ,\r\n“He who is of a calm and happy nature will\r\nhardly feel the pressures of age, but to him\r\nwho is of an opposite disposition, youth and\r\nage alike are equally burdensome”.\r\nFinally, the following verse comes to mind:\r\nJourney through the years.\r\nSpeak with kindness; cause no tears.\r\nDo some good along the way. Do a little every day.\r\nLet no good by thee be marred. Let no duty seem\r\ntoo hard.\r\nIn all things do your best.\r\nAnd then to God you\u0027ll leave the rest.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nMr. De Saram (Sri Lanka): I have the honour, on\r\nbehalf of Sri Lanka, to participate in this important\r\nconsideration in the General Assembly of the vast and\r\nglobal problem of the ageing of populations around the\r\nworld.\r\nThe fact that this is in all probability the last debate on\r\nthe subject of ageing that will take place in the General\r\nAssembly — this year, this century, this millennium —\r\ngives this debate special significance. The number of\r\nspeakers that have addressed the Assembly on the subject\r\nof ageing speaks to the importance of the subject. They\r\nhave spoken eloquently. With what they have said, Sri\r\nLanka would concur.\r\nI would only wish, on behalf of Sri Lanka, to reaffirm\r\nthat the treatment of the elderly — and, as we all know, the\r\nshadows lengthen for each one of us — should be such that\r\nit is thoughtful, constructive and kind: to derive from the\r\nold the wisdom of their years, to treat them with the\r\ngentleness and the benevolence that accords with this\r\nworld\u0027s concern for the dignity of the individual human\r\nbeing.\r\nSri Lanka has been greatly moved and greatly inspired\r\nby the work of the United Nations in the field of ageing. I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity of briefly informing the\r\nAssembly of some of the measures that Sri Lanka has\r\ntaken, in the light of the teachings of the United Nations, in\r\nthe field of ageing.\r\nAn Action Plan for the International Year of Older\r\nPersons was prepared in Sri Lanka and is being\r\nimplemented by the National Committee on Ageing. The\r\nmeasures included in the Plan are the following: raising\r\nawareness among the general public on the problems of an\r\nageing society; the introduction of a special identity card\r\nfor older persons; improvement of health-related facilities\r\nfor the benefit of older persons; educating and encouraging\r\nschoolchildren in providing care to the elderly; introducing\r\na social security scheme for those of the elderly who are\r\nnot entitled to a Government pension or to a provident fund\r\nbenefit; and organizing and preparing a home help service\r\nscheme. Training programmes and seminars and workshops\r\nfor retired Government officials have also been introduced.\r\nThe Government of Sri Lanka remains totally\r\ncommitted to the International Plan of Action on Ageing\r\nand has made elaborate plans for its implementation. A\r\nNational Committee that had originally been set up in 1982\r\nwas re-established in 1991 to work out a national policy\r\nand plan of action for the promotion of the welfare of the\r\nolder persons.\r\nIn Sri Lanka, 1999 is being observed as the Year of\r\nOlder Persons, and the National Committee of Sri Lanka\r\nhas reformulated its policies and revised its activities.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the objective\r\nof the Government of Sri Lanka is to provide our country\r\nwith adequate leadership and initiative in matters of\r\npolicy to ensure that there is a healthy environment\r\ncreated in Sri Lanka for older persons within the cultural\r\nmores and religious practices of the country.\r\nFinally, may I thank in particular Ambassador Julia\r\nÁlvarez for her valuable contributions to transforming the\r\nidea of an International Year of Older Persons into such\r\na wonderful reality.\r\nI would also like to thank Mr. Aurelio Fernández,\r\nCounsellor for Social Affairs of the Permanent Mission of\r\nSpain, for all that he has done.\r\nMr. García González (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I wish to congratulate the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on his skilful stewardship of these\r\nimportant meetings devoted to the follow-up of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. We also wish,\r\nthrough him, to extend our thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on this issue, contained in\r\ndocument A/54/268. That report has given us an\r\nappreciation of the scope and effects within the\r\ninternational community of the observance of this Year.\r\nMy delegation also endorses and supports the ideas\r\nexpressed by the representative of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina on this item.\r\nAccording to a variety of studies carried out by\r\nsocial researchers and regional bodies, such as the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC), the population of Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean is ageing. Progress in their living standards,\r\nparticularly in terms of health, and, notably, the sustained\r\ndecline in birth rates have led to a considerable\r\nlengthening of people’s life expectancy and to a rapid rise\r\nin the proportion of older persons in the total population.\r\nEl Salvador is aware that this increase in the number\r\nof older persons represents for our country and for the\r\nregion at large a challenge to which we must find an\r\nappropriate response, particularly bearing in mind that the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nliving conditions of this major sector of our population are\r\nnot favourable.\r\nTherefore, with the establishment of the National\r\nFamily Secretariat in 1989, the Salvadoran Government\r\nsought to offer an institutional response to the\r\ndisadvantageous situation being endured by vulnerable\r\ngroups in our country, in particular the elderly. To that end\r\na set of instruments and national guidelines was devised,\r\ninspired, inter alia, by the principles of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which acknowledges the\r\nintrinsic dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all\r\nmembers of the human family.\r\nThese measures were also inspired by the\r\nrecommendations of the World Assembly on Ageing, held\r\nin Vienna in 1982; the Guadalajara Declaration of July\r\n1991, the agreements on social security adopted at the\r\nIbero-American Summit held in Madrid in July 1992, the\r\nCartagena declaration on comprehensive policies for older\r\npersons in the Ibero-American area and the consensus\r\ndeclaration on policies of care for older persons in Latin\r\nAmerica adopted in Santiago de Chile in November 1992.\r\nThis set of commitments undertaken through various\r\nconferences, conventions and regional and international\r\nsummit conferences contributed to the devising and defining\r\nby the Salvadoran Government of our national policy of\r\ncaring for elderly persons. This national policy and the\r\nactions emanating from it are designed to direct appropriate\r\nattention to the need to promote an independent life for,\r\nand achieve the full participation of, older persons in the\r\nsocial and economic life of our country. The guiding\r\nprinciples for all our steps geared to this end are\r\nuniversality, normalization and democratization.\r\nIn line with the principle of universality, the\r\nSalvadoran Government will have to strive to ensure that\r\nour resources meet the basic needs of all older persons. To\r\nthis end, we envisage measures to benefit all sectors of the\r\nolder population, taking care to ensure that needs are met\r\nfor those living in the countryside and in outlying urban\r\nareas, older women, disabled older persons and all groups\r\nof older persons who because of their race, culture, religion,\r\neconomic situation or political ideas might have limited\r\naccess to all kinds of services and comprehensive care.\r\nThe principle of normalization reflects in turn the right\r\nof older persons to live the decent kind of life to which\r\nthey have been accustomed, while at the same time\r\nbenefiting, along with the rest of the population, from all\r\nthe social and economic progress and improvement the\r\ncountry experiences.\r\nThe principle of democratization is designed to allow\r\nenjoyment of the right to a full life and to participate in\r\nthe economic, social and cultural development of the\r\ncommunity through the formulation of policies, strategies\r\nand measures geared to improving quality of life.\r\nWhen the United Nations proclaimed 1999 the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, the slogan “A society\r\nfor all ages” was adopted, and four facets were defined\r\nfor focusing the work in this respect: the situation of\r\nolder persons, lifelong individual development,\r\nmultigenerational relationships and population ageing and\r\ndevelopment of the population.\r\nAs part of our national policy of caring for the\r\nelderly, the Government of El Salvador attached great\r\nimportance to promoting and developing an\r\nintergenerational dialogue. We consider this a\r\nfundamental tool for building that \"society for all ages\".\r\nWe are stressing the need to foster participation by and\r\npartnership between the young and the elderly in projects\r\nof national scope; decentralizing specialized services in\r\ngreatest demand in order to make them more accessible;\r\nand creating geriatric units staffed by medical teams and\r\nmultidisciplinary specialized personnel able to develop\r\nout-patient and hospital care, to name just a few\r\nmeasures.\r\nThrough these policy steps and activities designed to\r\nprovide comprehensive care, the Salvadoran Government\r\nhas commemorated the International Year of Older\r\nPersons. At the same time, we have laid the groundwork\r\nfor further development by revising and updating the\r\nnational policy of caring for elderly persons and have\r\nbegun to meet the challenge of the ageing of our\r\nsubregion’s population.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm the commitment\r\nof the Government of El Salvador to continue to make\r\nstrides in the building of a society for all ages through the\r\nfull implementation of our national policy of care for the\r\nelderly and by lending a human dimension to ageing, as\r\nAmbassador Julia Tavares de Álvares of the Dominican\r\nRepublic said at the ceremony that launched the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons on 1 October 1998.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In\r\naccordance with the decision adopted earlier by the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nGeneral Assembly, I now call on the Observer of the Holy\r\nSee.\r\nArchbishop Martino (Holy See): The Holy See\r\nwelcomes this opportunity to join in the discussion of the\r\nfollow-up to the International Year of Older Persons. It is\r\na topic the Holy See has followed with the closest interest,\r\nand it is with satisfaction that we have seen the\r\nconsiderable strides that have been made in mainstreaming\r\nthe concerns of older persons into the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe live in an age of sweeping demographic changes,\r\na time when the estimated population of the aged in the\r\nworld is 600 million out of 6 billion, and when it is\r\nestimated to grow to 2 billion out of 8.9 billion by 2050.\r\nBy that time, if projections prove true, the population of\r\nolder persons will be larger than the population of children\r\nunder 14. Persons over 60 have become a significant\r\nsegment of the world population and an important factor in\r\nany attempt to plan for social development.\r\nFor too long, however, the aged have been a neglected\r\nand often invisible section of the population, often missing\r\nthe interest of development planners. Many of the aged are\r\nfragile and ill and do not have access to adequate health\r\ncare. Some institutions do not want to maintain the\r\nchronically ill or those who are unlikely to recover, and\r\ninsurers do not want to pay.\r\nAmong the most serious difficulties from which aged\r\npeople suffer are, of course, the economic ones. Because of\r\nthe reduction in income that comes after retirement, a high\r\npercentage of older people find themselves living near the\r\npoverty level. Government schemes, where they exist, are\r\ngenerally inadequate, and inflation becomes a serious\r\nmenace. As a result, the aged sometimes even cut back on\r\ntheir food, and nutritional deficiencies ensue.\r\nAmong the problems from which the aged suffer the\r\nworst are loneliness and a sense of marginalization. In a\r\nworld which values productivity so highly, elderly people\r\nare often deemed unproductive and, indeed, are too often\r\nconsidered a burden to others. Even when not obliged to\r\nleave the workforce because of mandatory retirement, the\r\nolder worker in urban areas is often regarded as ineffective\r\nor unprepared to take on new tasks, and he or she often\r\nencounters active discrimination when seeking work. This\r\nleaves him or her with a sense of uselessness.\r\nPerhaps none are more marginalized than the elderly\r\nwithout family connections. Prior to the twentieth century,\r\ncare of the aged was considered a family responsibility.\r\nBut today most adult children are working, without\r\nanything like family leave available to them. When aged\r\nparents need help, they are very often left without\r\naffectionate, caring presences to fill their loneliness.\r\nAccording to a survey undertaken some time ago among\r\nthe National Councils of Catholic Bishops by the Opera\r\nPia, a Catholic Church society for the ageing, nearly all\r\nsocieties reported overt or underlying marginalization of\r\nthe aged that cut across the economic, psychological and\r\nsocial aspects of their lives.\r\nFor its part, the Holy See is strongly convinced of\r\nthe value of older persons — with their accumulated\r\nexperience, skills and wisdom, based on their unique,\r\nirreplaceable humanity. This concern is manifested in the\r\nwork the Church does for the aged poor, in the 12,000\r\nnursing homes for the aged that it maintains worldwide\r\nand in the devoted efforts of the many religious orders\r\nthat care for the aged. Major research in gerontology is\r\nbeing done in Catholic universities throughout the world.\r\nCatholic hospitals have been pioneers in designing\r\npalliative care. Only last March the Pontifical Council for\r\nthe Laity, the Holy See\u0027s office designated as the focal\r\npoint for the coordination of the Holy See\u0027s activities for\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons, issued a\r\ndocument entitled “The Dignity of Older People and their\r\nMission in the Church and in the World”, which\r\nreaffirmed the primary importance of recognizing and\r\nfostering the intrinsic value of persons of all ages. This\r\ndocument was distributed last March to all Permanent\r\nRepresentatives accredited to the United Nations.\r\nThe Church\u0027s view of ageing is deeply rooted in\r\nbiblical tradition. In the Old Testament a long life is seen\r\nas one of the signs of God\u0027s presence among his people.\r\nScripture tells us that a sign of the return to peace would\r\nbe that old men and women would sit again in the square\r\nof Jerusalem. In the New Testament, Saint Peter reminds\r\nthe early Christians to do what the elders ask of them.\r\nPope John Paul II has often stressed the importance\r\nof the work done to assist the elderly. In one of his recent\r\nstatements on the subject he said:\r\n“By their very presence, older people remind\r\neveryone, especially the young, that life on\r\nearth is a parable with its own beginning and\r\nend: to find its fulfilment, life must be based\r\non values that are not transient and superficial,\r\nbut solid and profound.”\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 5 October 1999\r\nIn conclusion, Pope John Paul reminds us that,\r\n“the so-called third age is ... a value in itself by\r\nthe very fact that life is prolonged and life itself\r\nis a gift of God.”\r\nIt has been said that the worth of a civilization is to be\r\nmeasured by the attention it offers to its aged. The Holy\r\nSee congratulates the General Assembly on its efforts\r\nduring the International Year of Older Persons, and urges\r\nsociety to undertake ever more positive initiatives on their\r\nbehalf.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this agenda item.\r\nI now call on the representative of the Dominican\r\nRepublic to introduce draft resolution A/54/L.6.\r\nMrs. Álvarez (Dominican Republic) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On behalf of the delegations of Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Bangladesh, Benin, Colombia, Cyprus, Ecuador,\r\nEl Salvador, Germany, Ghana, Guyana, Malta, Mongolia,\r\nPanama, Peru, Romania, Spain, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nUruguay and my own delegation, which were the original\r\nsponsors, as well as the delegations of Argentina, Burkina\r\nFaso, Costa Rica, Côte d\u0027Ivoire, Croatia, Guatemala, India,\r\nJamaica, Monaco, Nicaragua, the former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia, Ukraine, Venezuela and Viet Nam, which\r\nhave joined us, I have the honour to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.6, “Follow-up to the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons: a society for all ages”.\r\nI shall not dwell on the various paragraphs of this\r\ndraft resolution that we believe are self-explanatory; I shall\r\nconfine myself to stressing some of the operative\r\nparagraphs that we deem to be worthy of particular\r\nattention.\r\nBy paragraph 1, the Assembly would note that there\r\nis a need for guidelines and recommendations reflecting the\r\ncurrent situation of societies and older persons in order to\r\ndesign and support adequate age-related policies.\r\nBy paragraph 2 it would emphasize the need to\r\naddress the developmental aspects of ageing with particular\r\nattention to the situation of developing countries.\r\nIn paragraph 7, the General Assembly invites the\r\nCommittee on Human Rights, the Committee on the\r\nElimination of Discrimination against Women and the\r\nCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to\r\ninclude in their questionnaires addressed to States parties\r\nquestions relevant to older persons, and to address such\r\nquestions during the examination of the reports of States\r\nparties.\r\nThe Assembly, in paragraph 9, encourages regional\r\ninitiatives to follow up on the International Year of Older\r\nPersons and to provide input into the process of revision\r\nof the International Plan of Action on Ageing, given that\r\ndifferent regions and countries are at different stages of\r\npopulation ageing and need to identify specific policy\r\nresponses in order to achieve the goal of “A society for\r\nall ages”.\r\nIn paragraph 10, the Assembly takes notes with\r\nappreciation of the offer by the Government of Germany\r\nto host, if approved, a regional ministerial conference on\r\nageing, under the auspices of the Economic Commission\r\nfor Europe, in 2002.\r\nIn paragraph 11, the Assembly decides entrust the\r\nCommission for Social Development with the project of\r\na revision of the International Plan of Action on Ageing\r\nand the elaboration of a long-term strategy on ageing,\r\nbased on new developments since 1982 and on the\r\nexperience of the International Year of Older Persons in\r\n1999, with a view to the adoption of a revised plan of\r\naction and of a long-term strategy on ageing in 2002.\r\nFinally, in paragraph 15, the General Assembly takes\r\nnote with appreciation of the offer by the Government of\r\nSpain to host, if approved, a second World Assembly on\r\nAgeing in 2002.\r\nWe the sponsors of this draft resolution believe that\r\nits adoption would ensure an appropriate follow-up to the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. We hope that we can\r\ncount on the support of all delegations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to\r\ninform members that in order to allow more time for\r\nconsultations, action on draft resolution A/54/L.6, which\r\nhas been formally introduced, will be taken at a later date.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.45 p.m.\r\n14\r\n"
