(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 109\r\nAdvancement of women\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.4)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that at its 3rd\r\nplenary meeting, on 17 September 1999, the General\r\nAssembly decided that agenda item 109 would be\r\nconsidered directly in plenary meeting, for the sole purpose\r\nof taking action on the draft resolution entitled “Optional\r\nProtocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\r\nof Discrimination against Women”, which was\r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in its resolution 1999/13 of\r\n28 July 1999, on the understanding that this would not set\r\na precedent. The draft resolution has been issued as\r\ndocument A/54/L.4.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.4, entitled “Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.4?\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.4 was adopted (resolution\r\n54/4).\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded\r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 109.\r\nAgenda item 37\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/220)\r\nReport of the Preparatory Committee for the\r\nSpecial Session of the General Assembly on the\r\nImplementation of the Outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and Further\r\nInitiatives (A/54/45 and Corr.1 and Add.1)\r\nDraft decisions I, II and III (A/54/45, para. 71\r\nand Corr.1); and IV (A/54/45/Add.1, para. 6)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat, in a letter dated 6 October 1999 addressed to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Italy to the United Nations, in his\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Group of Western European\r\nand Other States for the month of October, requests that\r\nthe General Assembly hear in plenary meeting a statement\r\nby the Observer of Switzerland on agenda item 37,\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development”.\r\nTaking into account the importance attached to the\r\nissue under discussion, it is proposed that the General\r\nAssembly should take a decision on that request.\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the proposal\r\nto hear a statement by the Observer of Switzerland on this\r\nitem?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): Less than a year from now,\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development and further initiatives will be\r\nconvened. Member States of the United Nations will then\r\nhave the opportunity to assess the achievement of the goals\r\nset by the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction and to propose further measures for its\r\nimplementation. It will also be an occasion on which\r\nGovernments and the international community can\r\nrecommit themselves to the enhancement of social\r\ndevelopment for the peoples of the world.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I would now\r\nlike to speak of the particular social development concerns\r\nthat we have and the ways and means by which they may\r\nbe addressed.\r\nAt the outset, let me say that in an age which has\r\nwitnessed outstanding scientific and technological progress,\r\nit is disquieting to see the rising number of people living in\r\nabject poverty. The eradication of poverty remains the\r\nforemost challenge for the developing world, where policy\r\nmakers struggle on a daily basis to respond to the most\r\nbasic needs of their peoples despite dwindling financial\r\nresources, disappointing economic growth rates and their\r\ncountries\u0027 growing marginalization in the world\u0027s economy.\r\nFor too many countries, the target of halving poverty by the\r\nyear 2015 has proved elusive, and indeed, the President of\r\nthe World Bank and the Managing Director of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) appear to have\r\nconfirmed, at their recent meeting in Washington, that the\r\ngoals which the international community had set itself for\r\nsuch important social services as health and housing will\r\nnot be fulfilled as expected.\r\nIn the light of this pessimistic projection, the Group of\r\n77 and China calls for a redoubled effort to arrest the\r\nrampant process of social degradation. We are convinced\r\nthat people-centred development with an emphasis on\r\npoverty reduction, employment generation and social\r\nintegration can lead to an improvement in the living\r\nconditions of the world\u0027s peoples. To be effective, however,\r\npoverty eradication strategies need to be holistic, multi-\r\npronged and broad-based, paying particular attention to the\r\nneeds of women and children, who constitute the majority\r\nof the world\u0027s poorest. Equally important, they must\r\npromote and incorporate policies for universal access to\r\nbasic and primary education, improved literacy, increased\r\nlife expectancy, reduced infant and maternal mortality\r\nrates and the achievement of levels of health that lead to\r\nsocially and economically productive lives. Poverty\r\neradication strategies must also address the social ills of\r\nunemployment and underemployment.\r\nThe goal of full employment for poverty reduction\r\ncannot be overemphasized. The Group of 77 reiterates its\r\ncall for increased attention to be paid to employment\r\nexpansion, particularly for women, youth, the disabled\r\nand older persons. Recognizing the important contribution\r\nof self-employment and the informal sector for the\r\nprovision of employment opportunities, we would also\r\nadvocate initiatives that encourage such enterprise. As\r\nstudies have clearly shown, such forms of employment\r\nare of particular significance in times of economic\r\ndifficulty, including those associated with structural\r\nadjustment programmes, when retrenchment is usually\r\nwidespread and investment in the social sector is\r\ngenerally reduced. The informal sector and microcredit\r\nschemes have enabled the poor and other vulnerable\r\nsocial groups not only to sustain themselves but also to\r\nparticipate in development, thereby reducing the potential\r\nfor social unrest.\r\nIf nothing else, our experience since 1995 has taught\r\nus that the achievement of social development goals set\r\nin Copenhagen will depend in large measure on sustained\r\ndomestic growth and an enabling international\r\nenvironment. Developing countries need to be assured of\r\na more level playing field for the marketing of their\r\nproducts and more favourable and fairer terms of trade.\r\nAt the forthcoming World Trade Organization ministerial\r\nmeeting in Seattle, and later, at the tenth session of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development in\r\nBangkok, we must ensure that these needs are met.\r\nOur high debt-servicing bills also remain a serious\r\nimpediment to our future development. Admittedly, there\r\nhave been several commendable initiatives, the latest\r\nbeing the Cologne initiative, which have effectively\r\nreduced the debt stock. Unfortunately, however, they are\r\nnot nearly enough to relieve the burden faced by many\r\ndeveloping countries. For the poorest of these, we must\r\naim for debt cancellation, which alone can provide the\r\nbreathing space necessary for recovery. We would also\r\nagain urge an immediate reversal of the declining trend of\r\nofficial development assistance from the agreed target of\r\n0.7 per cent of the gross national product of donor\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\ncountries and the creation of more incentives to encourage\r\nmore capital flows and investments to developing countries.\r\nAs the financial crisis in Asia effectively\r\ndemonstrated, globalization and liberalization of the world\r\neconomy can be quite destructive, especially for weak\r\neconomies. Sudden and widespread poverty, unemployment\r\nand homelessness can quickly sweep away decades of\r\nprogress and economic development. It is worrying to note\r\nthat the concern about the reliability of the prevailing\r\nfinancial architecture, which peaked when the crisis was\r\nfull blown, appears to have dissipated almost completely.\r\nHowever, I believe that since the situation has not changed\r\nfundamentally, it would be foolish to be lulled into\r\ncomplacency. There is still an urgent need for greater\r\nmacroeconomic vigilance to protect developing countries\r\nfrom the uncontrolled consequences which globalization has\r\nbeen known to bring.\r\nIn reviewing the Copenhagen commitments, we must\r\nbe sensitive to the particular difficulties facing Africa, the\r\nleast developed countries and small economies generally as\r\nthey seek to respond to the social needs of their population.\r\nThe deteriorating external economic environment has made\r\nit extremely difficult for those countries to address the\r\nstructural deficiencies which inhibit their productivity and\r\neconomic growth. Furthermore, many of them are prone to\r\nnatural and other disasters which severely sap their ability\r\nto address social needs.\r\nThus far, the preparatory process for the special\r\nsession has amply revealed the shortcomings in our efforts\r\nto reach the goals of the Social Summit. The Group of 77\r\nand China looks forward to the timely issuance of the\r\nreports requested of the United Nations system during the\r\nfirst session of the Preparatory Committee, since they can\r\nprovide an even clearer assessment of the magnitude of the\r\nobstacles encountered. As with the national reports and\r\nstudies done at the regional level, the recommendations\r\noffered therein could serve as a basis for the active\r\nconsideration of those issues by the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment when it meets next year. The Group is\r\nconfident that the members of the Bureau of Preparatory\r\nCommittee and the United Nations Division for Social\r\nPolicy and Development, which have provided excellent\r\nleadership thus far in our preparations, will ensure that the\r\nreview process is a productive one.\r\nIn concluding, let me emphasize our view that to\r\nsucceed, the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction require a strong partnership among Governments,\r\ncivil society and the international community. All\r\nstakeholders should contribute actively to the\r\nimplementation of the Summit\u0027s commitments since all\r\nhave an interest in securing a socially stable world.\r\nMs. Korpi (Finland): I have the honour to take the\r\nfloor on behalf of the European Union on agenda item 37,\r\nentitled “Implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development”. The Central and\r\nEastern European countries associated with the European\r\nUnion — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia — and the associated countries, Cyprus and\r\nMalta, as well as the European Free Trade Association\r\ncountries members of the European Economic Area,\r\nIceland and Liechtenstein, have expressed their wish to\r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nAlmost five years have passed since heads of State\r\nand Government gathered in Copenhagen to recognize the\r\nsignificance of social development and human well-being\r\nfor all and to give these goals the highest priority. They\r\nacknowledged the urgent need to address profound social\r\nproblems, especially poverty, unemployment and social\r\nexclusion, that affect every country.\r\nIn June 2000 in Geneva, the Member States will\r\nmeet again to reaffirm their commitment to the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. They\r\nwill review and assess progress made regarding the\r\nimplementation of the Copenhagen commitments and\r\nconsider initiatives and actions to implement them further.\r\nRegarding the outcome of the special session, the\r\nEuropean Union would welcome a substantive, balanced\r\nand concise political declaration. In respect of the review\r\nand appraisal, the agreed conclusions of the Commission\r\nfor Social Development since the Summit should become\r\npart of the final outcome.\r\nThe European Union is fully committed to the\r\npreparatory process leading to the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in June 2000. It is our sincere wish to\r\nmake that session a success. The European Union\r\nwelcomes the progress made on many important issues\r\nduring the inter-sessional informal consultations of the\r\nPreparatory Committee at the beginning of September.\r\nMuch more clarity was achieved regarding the views of\r\nvarious negotiating groups. The European Union is\r\npleased that it was possible to reach an agreement on the\r\nparticipation and accreditation of non-governmental\r\norganizations at the special session. The results of those\r\ninformal consultations provide us with a good basis to\r\ncontinue the preparatory process.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nThere will be more information available and better\r\nunderstanding regarding the state of world social\r\ndevelopment and progress made since the Summit as soon\r\nas the national reports have been analysed by the\r\nSecretariat. The Summit has clearly had an impact on\r\nGovernment policies, as well as on United Nations and\r\nWorld Bank development activities. A preliminary\r\nassessment, however, indicates that despite some progress,\r\nmuch remains to be done.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the initiative, taken by\r\nthe Council of Europe, to support the preparations for the\r\nspecial session in the European region by organizing, in\r\ncooperation with the Government of Ireland, a European\r\nmeeting on social development. The meeting is being\r\npreceded by preparatory work focusing on the three main\r\nthemes of the meeting: social integration, an enabling\r\nenvironment and poverty eradication. At the same time, the\r\nEuropean Union hopes that the preparations for the\r\nEuropean meeting will contribute to closer and better\r\ncooperation between the intergovernmental organizations\r\nthat are active in the field of social development in Europe.\r\nSince the Summit, changing trends in trade, new\r\ntechnologies and the process of globalization have offered\r\nnew opportunities, but they have also created new\r\nchallenges for the implementation of the Summit goals.\r\nEradication of poverty remains an unmet goal. The\r\nchallenge of eradicating poverty can, however, be met on\r\nthe basis of a broad agreement reached among all actors\r\nsince Copenhagen on appropriate strategies to reduce\r\npoverty. These include strengthening the financial and\r\neconomic architecture at the macro level, while at the\r\nnational level promoting explicit pro-poor policies,\r\ninvestment in basic social services, participatory strategies\r\nand the empowerment of women.\r\nThe ongoing discrimination against women in all\r\nsocieties concerning access to education and gainful\r\nemployment must be given special attention.\r\nProductive employment is a key element in eradicating\r\npoverty and in enhancing social integration. The overall\r\nissue of social integration, particularly universal access to\r\nsocial services, deserves more attention. In this context of\r\nsocial integration, the importance of families must be\r\nrecognized. Therefore, policies in both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries need to be formulated which ensure\r\nthat livelihoods are sustained and vulnerability reduced\r\ngenerally. At the same time, these policies should give\r\nspecific attention to groups with special needs, such as the\r\nlong-term unemployed and young people. Also fundamental\r\nrights at work, as contained in the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental\r\nPrinciples and Rights at Work adopted in June 1998 must\r\nbe respected. Furthermore, the European Union\r\nencourages speedy ratification of the ILO Convention\r\nconcerning the prohibition and immediate action for the\r\nelimination of the worst forms of child labour, which was\r\nconcluded this year.\r\nUniversal and lasting peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment can be achieved only if they are based upon\r\nsocial justice. It is important to enhance the promotion of\r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy,\r\ngood governance, participation by civil society, and\r\nequality between women and men. Respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms is also an essential\r\nprerequisite for social integration.\r\nThe implementation of the Copenhagen\r\ncommitments and the preparatory process for the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly is to be seen not in\r\nisolation, but in close relation to the integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the other\r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits, as well\r\nas other global negotiations such as the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Millennium Round. Those\r\nconferences gave new impetus and new strength to\r\ninternational efforts in the fields of human rights, equality\r\nbetween men and women, social development, education,\r\npopulation policy, drugs and crime related issues,\r\nenvironment and sustainable development, trade and\r\ndevelopment, human settlements and food security. Those\r\nconferences and summits resulted in a challenging global\r\nagenda on the threshold of the new millennium.\r\nThere is broad agreement that Governments bear the\r\nprimary responsibility for the implementation of these\r\ncommitments. The international community, including\r\nUnited Nations system, plays an important role in\r\nassisting Governments to enhance their capacity to meet\r\nthe challenges. It is clear, however, that only consistent,\r\ncoherent and coordinated joint action will make it\r\npossible for the United Nations system to assist\r\neffectively in the implementation of the commitments\r\nmade at the United Nations conferences and summits.\r\nThe Bretton Woods institutions are major global\r\nplayers in the economic and social field, and as such are\r\nimportant partners within the United Nations system. The\r\nEuropean Union welcomes the World Bank\u0027s initiative on\r\nprinciples and good practices in social policy. We\r\nstrongly support the view of the Bank\u0027s Development\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nCommittee that further development of these principles\r\nwould be best pursued within the broader framework of the\r\nUnited Nations system through cooperation between\r\nrelevant agencies and the international financial institutions.\r\nThe European Union will welcome positive discussion on\r\nthese and related issues in the preparatory process leading\r\nup to the special session next year. We call for the process\r\nto continue with a view to establishing a framework of\r\nprinciples and good practices in social policy that would\r\nalso take account of the need for flexibility in differing\r\nnational situations. The European Union would also\r\nwelcome strengthened cooperation within the multilateral\r\nsystem to share information on existing internationally\r\ndeveloped standards and good practices in social policy and\r\nto make that information more easily accessible to all\r\nactors. The European Union shares the view that the social\r\ndimension should be integrated in all aspects of the\r\nmultilateral system, including trade.\r\nThe European Union welcomes Economic and Social\r\nCouncil resolution 1999/55 on integrated and coordinated\r\nimplementation of and follow-up to major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. The contribution of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, especially the progress made on the\r\nissue of how to continue developing a limited number of\r\ncommon indicators for conference follow-up, was timely\r\nand welcome. This positive dialogue should now continue\r\nas a part of the Copenhagen + 5 process, thus making it\r\npossible both at the national and the international levels to\r\nbetter assess the progress made in the implementation of\r\nthe Copenhagen commitments. One important element in\r\nthis process is national capacity-building, which could\r\ninclude support for the authorities responsible for national\r\nmonitoring and evaluation.\r\nEffective implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action requires the\r\nstrengthening of community organizations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and other relevant actors of\r\ncivil society to enable them to participate effectively in the\r\ndesign, implementation and evaluation of social\r\ndevelopment policies, strategies and programmes.\r\nGovernments play a crucial role in creating an enabling\r\nenvironment for civil-society participation, including the\r\nactivities of volunteers. The European Union will continue\r\nto explore ways and means to promote active participation\r\nby representatives of employers\u0027 and workers\u0027 organizations\r\nin the work of the special session to be held in Geneva next\r\nyear.\r\nIn the context of social development, issues of\r\nchildren and youth should not be overlooked. Poverty\r\neradication, unemployment and social exclusion among\r\nyoung women and men are particularly important issues\r\nto be tackled, as they may have devastating effects on the\r\nsocial cohesion of societies and on the entire life span of\r\nan individual. Active participation by young people, and\r\nby the organizations representing them, in policy-making,\r\nespecially on issues that have direct relevance to their\r\nlives, should be supported both at national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nSociety must be organized in such a way that it can\r\nprovide opportunities and security for all its members,\r\nthus allowing social cohesion to develop. This principle\r\nof being an actor, but also a beneficiary on an equal\r\nbasis, applies particularly to persons with disabilities,\r\nindigenous people and groups with special needs. Special\r\naction based on the principle of non-discrimination is\r\nneeded to ensure that these groups can live full and\r\nproductive lives, have equal access to social services such\r\nas education and health care, and participate in the design\r\nand implementation of policies that affect their lives and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe European Union calls for a comprehensive\r\napproach to development, recognizing the primary\r\nresponsibility and ownership of the Government. This\r\napproach should take into consideration not only the level\r\nof official development assistance, but also other elements\r\nsuch as good governance, trade, private investment, debt\r\nand transfer of technology. We reiterate that efforts\r\nshould be strengthened towards the fulfilment of the\r\nofficial development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross national product by all donor countries, and we\r\nacknowledge that this will require a reversal in the\r\ndownward trend of official development assistance\r\noverall. We would also encourage donor and recipient\r\ncountries, based on mutual commitment, to fully\r\nimplement the 20/20 initiative. Assistance should\r\nconcentrate on assisting recipient countries in building an\r\nenabling domestic environment for social development.\r\nMoreover, the unsustainable debt burden of the\r\nheavily indebted poor countries must be addressed. In this\r\nrespect, the European Union welcomes the Group of\r\nSeven\u0027s Cologne initiative on debt alleviation and calls\r\nupon all organs of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, other actors and civil society to support the\r\ninitiative and to collaborate in this respect, so that freed\r\nresources will be invested by national Governments in\r\neducation and social services.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nCreditor countries and institutions should take action\r\nto achieve rapid progress towards deeper, broader and faster\r\ndebt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative and through other means to ensure a permanent\r\nway out of unsustainable debt burden for the poorest\r\ncountries, thus demonstrating their commitment to\r\neconomic and social reform and poverty reduction.\r\nThe European Union will continue to support Africa\r\nand the least developed countries in their efforts to\r\nimplement the commitments made at Copenhagen. Full\r\nimplementation of these commitments requires the\r\nmobilization of all development actors at all levels. The\r\nEuropean Union shares the Secretary-General’s view that a\r\nfundamental element in finding solutions to the problems in\r\nAfrica is to address the causes of conflicts and to promote\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development. In this respect,\r\npeace, democracy, human rights and development are\r\nstrongly interlinked.\r\nThe European Union looks forward to a further\r\ndialogue on these issues in the preparatory process for the\r\nspecial session.\r\nMr. Bouah-Kamon (Cote d’Ivoire) (spoke in French):\r\nFive years after the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nour Assembly will meet in a special session, from 26 to 30\r\nJune 2000, in Geneva, to consider and evaluate the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Social Summit and\r\nto propose specific actions and initiatives to promote\r\nimplementation of the Copenhagen commitments. This mid-\r\nterm review will make it possible to assess the impact of\r\nthe Copenhagen Programme of Action on people’s lives\r\nand its integration into international and national policies\r\naimed at mitigating social inequality, reducing poverty and\r\nincreasing employment while promoting social cohesion.\r\nThe session will not merely be an opportunity for the\r\nAssembly to identify good practices and to consider\r\nprogress made, but also to analyse the failures and the\r\nfactors that have blocked or slowed down implementation\r\nof the Copenhagen commitments. The session will facilitate\r\nthe adoption of new measures and initiatives to accelerate\r\nthe achievement of the goals of the Social Summit in the\r\nlight of the new challenges that need to be met.\r\nCommitment 1 of the Social Summit is the creation of\r\nan enabling environment for social development.\r\nInternational developments and the emergence of new\r\nchallenges have not been conducive to social progress, and\r\nsocial indicators show that, on the contrary, living standards\r\nhave declined in most developing countries. Per capita\r\nincome has dropped in more than 100 countries, and\r\nindividual consumption has gone down by about 1 per\r\ncent a year in more than 60 countries. Out of 4.4 billion\r\npeople, three fifths do not have basic health facilities, one\r\nthird have no access to drinking water, one fourth live in\r\nslums, one fifth go hungry and 1.3 billion have to live on\r\nless than a dollar a day. In sub-Saharan Africa, half the\r\npopulation has no access to health care, 42 per cent of the\r\nadult population is illiterate, one third have a life\r\nexpectancy of only 40 years and about 2 million deaths\r\nregistered in 1998 were caused by AIDS; 59 per cent of\r\nthe rural population and 43 per cent of the urban\r\npopulation live in abject poverty, with an annual income\r\nof about $100.\r\nDeclining living standards in the developing\r\ncountries in general, and in Africa in particular, are\r\nbasically due to the following factors. First, the many\r\narmed conflicts have caused flows of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, particularly in Africa, where in 1997,\r\n8.1 million people were uprooted by conflict. It must be\r\nacknowledged that some conflicts are caused by a\r\nprecipitous impoverishment and destruction of social\r\nstructures, as well as by the collapse of States that are no\r\nlonger able to guarantee the basic rights of their citizens.\r\nSecondly, a terrible dearth of resources results from the\r\nburden of debt servicing, dwindling external resource\r\nflows, the drop in official development assistance, the\r\ndecline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in\r\nexport earnings, all of which has not allowed basic social\r\nservices to be funded. Thirdly, the impact of globalization\r\nhas been negative, in particular its diabolical effects on\r\ninternational financial and commodities markets; many\r\npeople in the populations affected by the resultant crises\r\nhave been left destitute.\r\nIn order to attain the goal of halving poverty by the\r\nyear 2015, the international community must take bold,\r\nvigorous action to cancel the debt of the poorest\r\ncountries, to increase official development assistance and\r\nto relax World Trade Organization rules for developing\r\ncountries in order to create in these countries a favourable\r\nenvironment for social development.\r\nIn spite of this difficult situation, the Government of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire has undertaken to honour the Copenhagen\r\ncommitments by pursuing a social development policy,\r\nthe thrust of which is set out in the national plan for\r\ncombating poverty. This plan, elaborated in June 1997\r\nand called Priority Approaches for Combating Poverty,\r\nseeks to mitigate social inequality and to reduce the\r\npoverty rate from 36.7 per cent of the population in 1995\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nto 30 per cent in the year 2000 and to 25 per cent in the\r\nyear 2002. This poverty for combating poverty encompasses\r\nvarious areas: data collection and follow-up on social\r\nindicators, health, education, literacy training, employment,\r\npromotion of women, the family, young people and\r\nchildren, housing and living conditions, agriculture, basic\r\ninfrastructure, decentralization, energy, hydraulic power,\r\nand electrification.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire’s national plan also seeks to enhance the\r\ndevelopment of human resources and of health and\r\neducation services and to promote social initiatives to\r\nprovide universal, equitable access to high-quality education\r\nand health care for all.\r\nWith regard to education, the goal is to reduce\r\nilliteracy from 57.6 per cent in 1988 to 15 per cent in 2005.\r\nThe Government of Côte d’Ivoire has undertaken to\r\nmodernize and improve the level of teaching and access to\r\nbasic training. One thousand primary classes were set up\r\nbetween 1993 and 1997,of which 49 per cent were in the\r\ninterior of the country, providing schooling for about\r\n100,000 children.\r\nIn the area of health care, the national plan for health-\r\ncare development for the period 1996-2005 will continue to\r\nrehabilitate and build health-care infrastructure; to\r\nstrengthen health-care programmes, such as those on AIDS,\r\nexpanded immunization, Buruli ulcer and Guinea worm;\r\nand to provide ongoing training for health-care personnel.\r\nImmunization coverage was 70 per cent in 1997 and the\r\nnumber of rural maternity clinics and of doctors per\r\ninhabitant has almost doubled over the past five years.\r\nUnemployment remains a serious concern for my\r\nauthorities. They are committed to making greater efforts to\r\nset up basic social services to reduce the disparities\r\nbetween areas and to create jobs. Social projects for target\r\npopulations, such as women and children, have increased\r\ntheir participation in development activities.\r\nDespite these laudable efforts, much remains to be\r\ndone to attain the goals of the World Summit. Côte d’Ivoire\r\nspends 52 per cent of its budgetary resources on paying off\r\nits foreign debt and looks forward to some positive\r\nrepercussions from the decision taken at the G-8 Summit in\r\nCologne to release sufficient resources to finance its\r\npoverty-eradication policy. The proposed integration of debt\r\nrelief into the poverty-eradication strategy formulated by the\r\nGovernment in cooperation with all partners is a\r\ncommendable step.\r\nIt must be pointed out, however, that the link\r\nbetween debt relief and poverty eradication will depend\r\non the real flexibility we have to direct the revenue\r\nflowing from debt reduction. This real flexibility may be\r\nsmall for countries that were not able to service their debt\r\neffectively. That is why we must stress the need fully to\r\nunderstand this flexibility and the principle of financial\r\nadditionality. For our countries, the problem is about\r\nsufficient flows to finance development.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire hopes that the combined action of\r\nGovernments, international financial institutions, United\r\nNations development agencies and donor countries will\r\nmake it possible to improve the living standards of poor\r\npeoples.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation wishes to pay sincere\r\ntribute to the International Labour Organization and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, which have\r\nestablished a programme entitled “Jobs for Africa” to\r\ndevelop employment strategies to eradicate poverty in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa. This programme, established for\r\nabout 10 African countries, seeks to optimize employment\r\nand reduce poverty through a coherent, multisectoral and\r\nmulti-institutional strategy. A national network group of\r\nmembers from all socio-economic sectors will advocate\r\njob-creating activities, national-capacity building and the\r\ninvolvement of grass-roots communities.\r\nThis example should inspire all multilateral and\r\nparticularly bilateral development partners to support the\r\nefforts of our Governments, which work tirelessly to\r\nmake realities of the recommendations of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development.\r\nMr. Mehta (India): Gathering here to deliberate the\r\nimplementation of the Copenhagen commitments and to\r\nchart the preparatory process for the special session on\r\nthe World Summit at Geneva in June next year, we\r\ncannot help but reflect on the dismal economic scenario\r\nhighlighted in the Trade and Development Report for\r\n1999. It cautions that the factors that led to the Asian\r\nmeltdown continue to persist and could recur;\r\ninternational finances remain volatile and markets\r\ndepressed, with poor growth rates; and developing\r\ncountries continue to be denied export opportunities by\r\ntrade walls which remain staunchly in place in Western\r\neconomies.\r\nThe Report estimates that developing countries have\r\nlost four times as much due to the protectionism of\r\ndeveloped countries as they have received through private\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\ncapital inflows — a key negative equation considering that\r\ntrade earnings are much needed incomes to back production\r\nand employment, while capital inflows are monies to be\r\nrepaid with interest. In the restricted and hampered\r\nenvironment for greater income generation from trade-\r\nrelated activities, developing countries perforce have had to\r\nincrease their reliance on international borrowing. This\r\nreliance on borrowed “hot money” exposes them to acute\r\nand avoidable social and economic risks and holds their\r\npeoples ransom to unfaithful capital which knows not\r\npeople but profits.\r\nWe therefore wholeheartedly endorse the call of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) for a positive trade agenda. We believe that\r\nsuch an agenda should allow the free flow of goods from\r\ndeveloping countries and divert much of the $350-billion\r\nagricultural subsidies of the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) countries to social\r\nand economic development in developing countries. No\r\nsocial agenda or commitment can bear fruit in an\r\nenvironment which does not allow fair play in the markets.\r\nThe Copenhagen Summit visualized the world order as\r\nmoving towards the provision of basic human services for\r\nall. The fundamental philosophy of the Summit was to\r\nmake development more people-centred. In that philosophy,\r\nthe underlying principle was of equity in access to\r\nlivelihood, health, education and other social services in an\r\nenabling national and global order. However, what we have\r\ntoday as we approach the next century is a pattern of\r\ndisabling inequities in the international macroeconomic\r\nenvironment, which goes to debilitate social and economic\r\ndevelopment in the developing world. Pious\r\npronouncements of principles of social policies and abstract\r\nindicators of social progress will have little meaning unless\r\nwe are able to respect the spirit of basic equality and right\r\nto social and economic progress for all nations inscribed in\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, and strive consciously\r\nfor equity in all aspects of our dealings — person to person\r\nand nation to nation. Otherwise, we would be betraying the\r\nCopenhagen commitments.\r\nDeveloping countries do have an agenda to implement\r\non social and economic development for the welfare of\r\ntheir own peoples. We reaffirmed this agenda in the\r\nCommission on Social Development when the resolution on\r\nsocial services for all was adopted. In the agreed\r\nconclusions annexed to the resolution, it was clearly\r\nbrought out that the international economic environment,\r\nthrough its impact on national economies, affects the\r\ncapacity of developing countries to provide and expand\r\nquality social services. This is particularly true in the\r\ncontext of an increasingly globalizing world.\r\nGlobalization has shown that it can help build\r\nslowly, but break swiftly. Capital can cut both ways\r\nunless harnessed and controlled. It has the power to\r\ngenerate employment, but also to severely marginalize the\r\nweak. The predominance of private capital-driven\r\nglobalization cannot be the final answer for the social\r\ndevelopment needs of less-developed countries, for it is\r\nfundamentally fraught with instability. The lives of\r\ncountless people would be infinitely better and secure if\r\nglobalization were driven by equal opportunities for just\r\nearnings in a global marketplace.\r\nWhere do we stand today, four years after the\r\nCopenhagen Summit, in implementing the targets set out\r\nin the Programme of Action? From the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report, it is clear that those targets will not be\r\nfulfilled in the time-frame agreed upon at the Summit.\r\nThere is an array of reasons for this, but the single most\r\nimportant reason is the continuing lack of resources in\r\ncountries striving to attain a greater level of social and\r\neconomic development. Even to simply maintain a\r\nstandstill position, let alone aspire to a quantum leap,\r\nnations must spend beyond their budgeted means. There\r\nbeing no other recourse, the only way available to carry\r\nout activities, including investing in social capital, is\r\nthrough borrowed funds, whether from international\r\nsources, budgetary allocations from domestic sources or\r\ndomestic loans. The high cost implicit in loans for\r\ninvestment in the social sector can lead to greater debt\r\nand macroeconomic instability, which can cripple\r\ndeveloping countries in their efforts to provide social\r\nservices to all; but such investments are a necessity for\r\nhealthy growth of the social sector in order to provide\r\nsocial justice for all.\r\nTo reiterate, there can be no debate about the basic\r\nnecessity of developing countries\u0027 access to greater\r\nincome and resources through the non-inflationary path of\r\ninternational trade. Trade without impediments is the\r\ngreatest need of the times, rather than unfettered trade in\r\ncapital. There cannot be a stronger contribution to the\r\ncreation of an enabling environment for social and\r\neconomic transformation than this.\r\nThe 10 commitments made at Copenhagen served to\r\nunderline the inclusive nature of development. They also\r\nbrought into focus the fact that building social capital is\r\nas important as economic growth. Subsumed in the 10\r\ncommitments was the axiom that social investments in\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nareas such as education, skills, health, nutrition and gender\r\nin fact create a positive compact for greater economic\r\ngrowth and social advancement; indeed, the two are\r\ninextricable.\r\nWelfare has and must become an integral part of the\r\nagenda in the development of economies. However, as we\r\nundertake the review process and make preparations for the\r\nGeneva special session on social development, we have to\r\nreflect on whether the compact arrived at in Copenhagen\r\nrequires any change. While we do not feel that the\r\ncommitments need to be renegotiated, we strongly believe\r\nthat development, to be inclusive and dynamic, requires\r\nurgent new initiatives. A rededication to making the\r\nprovision of social services achievable by all is essential.\r\nVisible commitments to reforming the international\r\nenvironment and making it more enabling than it is at\r\npresent: this is the key to forging ahead. But above all, it is\r\nthe national and international will that matters.\r\nMr. Albin (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): It is an\r\nhonour for the delegation of Mexico to speak on behalf of\r\nthe Rio Group, in consideration of agenda item 37, entitled\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development”. First, the Rio Group would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General and the Secretariat for the\r\nreport on this item (A/54/220). This report will serve as a\r\nvaluable guide for the work of the General Assembly.\r\nThe members of the Rio Group have very resolutely\r\nundertaken a commitment to social development, as\r\nenshrined in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action and reflected in General Assembly resolution\r\n50/161 of 22 December 1995. This commitment was\r\nrecognized early on in the Buenos Aires Declaration, in\r\n1995, aimed at the regional implementation of the outcome\r\nof the Copenhagen World Summit. Subsequently, at\r\nmeetings held in Bolivia, Paraguay and Panama, the heads\r\nof State and Government of the Rio Group reaffirmed\r\nregional determination to combat and overcome poverty, as\r\nwell as their conviction that a sustained process of\r\neconomic and social development is the only guarantee of\r\nimproving people\u0027s quality of life and of democratic\r\nstability in Latin America.\r\nSimilarly, in the Veracruz declaration, signed on 19\r\nMarch 1999 in Mexico, the Rio Group reaffirmed its\r\nongoing commitment to implementing economic and social\r\nprogrammes designed to generate favourable conditions for\r\nthe definitive integration of the vulnerable sectors of the\r\npopulation into the development process and to eliminate\r\nstructural imbalances, in particular, conditions of poverty\r\nand marginalization. Furthermore, the Group stated that a\r\nholistic balance must be achieved among the economic,\r\nsocial and environmental objectives of development.\r\nIn addition to the political commitment undertaken\r\nby the Rio Group, Latin America has defined concrete\r\naction designed to achieve the objectives set at\r\nCopenhagen. These measures are contained in the São\r\nPaolo consensus, a document that has guided regional\r\nefforts for social development.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, we\r\nhave witnessed significant progress in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations in support of the effective implementation\r\nof the Copenhagen commitments. The Rio Group\r\nwelcomes with satisfaction the outcome of the thirty-\r\nseventh session of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment, whose conclusions on the subject of “Social\r\nservices for all” will guide the work done and the\r\nmeasures implemented by Governments in an area of\r\ngreat consequence for enhancing the quality of people\u0027s\r\nlives. The Commission also initiated a fruitful debate on\r\nthe general consideration of the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the Summit, a task that we hope it will be\r\nthoroughly discussed at its February 2000 session.\r\nThe Rio Group would like to reaffirm its gratitude\r\nto and support for the Bureau of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development, led by our colleague Mr. Aurelio\r\nFernández of Spain, for the efficiency with which they\r\nhave carried out their activities. We hope that the thirty-\r\neighth session of the Commission will be able to tackle\r\nthe tasks relating to the assessment of the implementation\r\nof the outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, so that the Commission will be able to\r\nmake a substantial contribution to the Preparatory\r\nCommittee and the special session to be held in the year\r\n2000.\r\nThe Rio Group also welcomes the work of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for Copenhagen + 5, chaired by\r\nour colleague and friend, Ambassador Christian\r\nMaquieira, of Chile, a member country of our Group. The\r\nwork carried out thus far has enabled the Committee to\r\nmake significant progress. The participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the special session has\r\nbeen spelled out. The Preparatory Committee has also\r\nallocated mandates to the various actors within the United\r\nNations family in order to promote the assessment of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit and facilitate the\r\nelaboration of initiatives to bring about better\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nimplementation of the 10 commitments undertaken by the\r\ninternational community in Copenhagen.\r\nIn addition, there has been an important negotiation\r\neffort within the Preparatory Committee concerning a final\r\ndocument for the special session. The Rio Group believes\r\nthat this document should generate a renewed impetus for\r\ncountries in their commitment to social development.\r\nTherefore, not only should it restate the commitment, but it\r\nmust also include new initiatives, bearing in mind what has\r\nalready been achieved in terms of integrating social policies\r\nwithin the general context of development.\r\nThe Rio Group believes that the responsibility of the\r\nMember States of the United Nations is to continue this\r\nprocess with as much imagination, creativity and dedication\r\nas possible, leaving aside old paradigms of confrontation\r\nwhich in the past only paralysed our action.\r\nBefore concluding, the Rio Group would like to restate\r\nits gratitude to the Government of Switzerland for the\r\nexcellent preparations being made for the special session to\r\nbe held in Geneva. We believe that these arrangements will\r\nmake possible broad participation and a level of\r\norganization that will provide a suitable framework for this\r\nimportant forum.\r\nGlobalization has had undeniably positive effects on\r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, the recent crisis that has\r\naffected our economies has revealed how fragile and\r\ndependent social aspects remain, since they have been the\r\nmost severely affected. The Rio Group therefore reaffirms\r\nthe need to seek ways to achieve a balance between the\r\neconomic and social realms, so as to achieve growth with\r\nequity and place development with a comprehensive\r\napproach within reach of all.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Almost five years ago our\r\nheads of State and Government gathered in Copenhagen\r\nand committed themselves to an ambitious agenda for\r\npoverty eradication, social integration and productive\r\nemployment. In less than a year from now, in June 2000,\r\nMember State representatives will meet again to reconfirm\r\ntheir commitment to the Copenhagen agenda and review\r\nprogress made in its implementation. They will consider\r\nwhere further initiatives are needed to make sure that the\r\ncommitments are followed up through concrete policies and\r\nactions at all levels.\r\nWe welcome the progress that has already been made\r\nduring the preparatory process. Before the next session of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee we will have before us a\r\nnumber of reports and recommendations on key aspects\r\nof social development from relevant organs and agencies\r\nof the United Nations. These inputs, in addition to the\r\nnational reports, will help us to identify the kind of\r\ninitiatives and action that need to be taken to ensure the\r\nfull implementation of the Social Summit agenda. In the\r\nprocess ahead, we also look forward to contributions from\r\nother relevant actors, not least from the non-governmental\r\norganization community and other parts of civil society.\r\nThe high-level segment of this year\u0027s Economic and\r\nSocial Council substantive session, entitled “The role of\r\nemployment and work in poverty eradication: the\r\nempowerment and advancement of women”, also\r\nprovided useful input to this follow-up process.\r\nThe forthcoming analysis of national reports will\r\nundoubtedly show that a lot has been done during the past\r\nfew years. On the other hand, we know that 30 per cent\r\nof the Earth\u0027s people still live on less than a dollar a day\r\nand that the last decade has seen no reduction in the\r\nnumber of poor people. The challenges are daunting, but\r\nwe have both the knowledge and the resources needed to\r\naddress them.\r\nFor the poorest and most heavily indebted countries,\r\nthe debt problem is one of the main obstacles to\r\ndevelopment. Urgent action is needed to end the\r\nunsustainable debt burden for these countries. Norway\r\nwarmly welcomes the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative agreed to by the recent\r\nannual meetings of the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF) and the World Bank. The changes made to the\r\nHIPC mechanism will result in deeper, broader and faster\r\ndebt relief, very much in line with what Norway has\r\nadvocated for years. The challenge now is to cover the\r\nremaining gap in order to secure full financing of the\r\nenhanced Initiative.\r\nAn enabling environment at both the national and\r\ninternational level is crucial for social development. Good\r\ngovernance and respect for human rights are fundamental\r\nelements of such an environment, as are macro-economic\r\nfactors.\r\nOne of the key outcomes of the Social Summit was\r\nagreement on the goal of universal access to basic social\r\nservices. Ensuring access to basic health services and\r\neducation for all will promote productive employment and\r\nsocial integration, and is crucial in the fight against\r\npoverty. The preparatory process has demonstrated that\r\nthere is broad consensus on this matter. However,\r\nuniversal access is far from being achieved, and further\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\naction and initiatives are needed at all levels. The reports\r\nexpected from the United Nations system — in particular\r\nthose on education for all, access to primary health services\r\nand implementation of the 20/20 Initiative — should guide\r\nus in our further efforts towards this goal.\r\nThe goal of full employment requires action at many\r\nlevels. Access to credit and training opportunities is\r\nessential. Special attention must be given to improving\r\nemployment opportunities for the long-term unemployed,\r\npeople with disabilities and other groups with special needs.\r\nAt the same time, Governments must ensure that the basic\r\nrights and interests of workers are safeguarded.\r\nNorway is concerned at the apparent increase in the\r\nnumber of children being exploited through child labour.\r\nUrgent action is needed at both the national and the\r\ninternational level. Speedy ratification by Member States of\r\nthe new International Labour Organization Convention\r\nagainst the worst forms of child labour would be an\r\nimportant contribution.\r\nThe main responsibility for implementing the\r\nCopenhagen commitments lies with national Governments.\r\nHowever, the cooperation of the international community is\r\nalso required, particularly in Africa and in the least\r\ndeveloped countries. Norway is deeply concerned about the\r\nlow level of global official development assistance. In the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development,\r\nthe average level of development assistance now stands at\r\napproximately 0.23 per cent of the gross national product,\r\nfar below the agreed target of 0.7 per cent.\r\nNorway has been contributing substantially more than\r\nthis for decades and is allocating increased resources to the\r\npoorest countries and to social sectors.\r\nHowever, increasing the resources available is only\r\none way of maximizing the impact of international\r\ndevelopment cooperation. We must also look into how our\r\ndevelopment efforts can be better coordinated. For the\r\nUnited Nations system, the United Nations Development\r\nAssistance Framework represents an important step towards\r\na more coordinated approach. The comprehensive\r\ndevelopment framework takes this one step further, by\r\nproposing that all foreign and domestic actors should\r\ncooperate on a common development strategy, with national\r\nGovernments in the driver\u0027s seat. We hope that the special\r\nsession will review how these and other initiatives can help\r\npromote implementation of the Summit commitments.\r\nI would like to conclude by saying that Norway is\r\nfully committed to the implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe Social Summit. We will take an active part in the\r\npreparations for the special session, and we will do our\r\nbest to contribute to its success.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): Mongolia attaches\r\ngreat importance to the consideration by the plenary\r\nAssembly of the agenda item entitled “Implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment”.\r\nThe peaceful advancement of the human family and\r\nthe security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in\r\na world impregnated by abject poverty, external debt\r\nburden, growing technological and economic gaps\r\nbetween the rich and the poor, widespread hunger and\r\nmalnutrition, violence and discrimination, drugs and\r\ninfectious diseases.\r\nMindful of the urgency to adequately address these\r\nproblems, during the last decade of this century the\r\ninternational community has taken various measures\r\nthrough, inter alia, organizing a series of world summits\r\nand conferences and proclaiming and observing United\r\nNations decades and international years on specific social\r\nissues and target groups. The Copenhagen Social Summit\r\nwas one such conference. It demonstrated that social\r\ndevelopment is indeed a question of global concern, and\r\ntherefore the implementation of its decisions naturally\r\nacquires special significance.\r\nThe cumulative results of the conferences offer a\r\nstrong basis for promoting development cooperation and\r\nidentifying the United Nations role in this area.\r\nDevelopment cooperation has rightly been given a people-\r\ncentred, sustainable, gender-sensitive and social\r\ndimension.\r\nMongolia attaches great importance to the\r\nforthcoming special session of the General Assembly, to\r\nbe devoted to the theme “World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and beyond: achieving social development\r\nfor all in a globalizing world”. We believe that it should\r\nreaffirm the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme\r\nof Action and identify the progress achieved and the\r\nchallenges that lie ahead. Concrete actions and initiatives\r\naimed at full and effective implementation of the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action should be\r\nidentified and adopted by the forthcoming session. In this\r\nregard, my delegation believes that the Human\r\nDevelopment Report prepared annually by the United\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nNations Development Programme can provide useful\r\nguidelines for defining and elaborating new, concrete\r\ninitiatives in the spirit of the Copenhagen Summit.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the results of last year\u0027s\r\nspecial session of the Economic and Social Council devoted\r\nto the integrated and coordinated implementation and\r\nfollow-up of major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits, as well as the work of the Preparatory Committee\r\non the implementation of the outcome of the Summit and\r\nfurther initiatives. Likewise, we welcome the practice of\r\nholding panel discussions on priority issues as an important\r\nand innovative contribution to these deliberations.\r\nMongolia, like many other countries undergoing\r\nfundamental changes, has been grappling with the\r\nchallenges of the transition period for the past eight years.\r\nMarket reforms have been boldly accelerated by\r\nliberalization of trade and prices, large-scale privatization\r\nand other economic measures.\r\nHowever, the reform process has been and still is\r\npainful. The inherent burdens of a weak banking and\r\nfinancial system, insignificant foreign investment,\r\nunfavourable market conditions and inefficient State\r\nenterprises, coupled with a lack of free- market traditions\r\nand experience, have compounded the reform challenge.\r\nThis has directly affected the social sector. Thus, according\r\nto Mongolia\u0027s human development report, the transition has\r\nnot been without its heavy costs. A large part of the\r\npopulation is poor and unemployed. The child mortality rate\r\nis still high. Almost one fourth of the population still does\r\nnot have access to safe drinking water. Moreover, the\r\nphenomenon of street children continues to arouse deep\r\nconcern in our society.\r\nTo adequately address the problems, the Government\r\nof Mongolia is mobilizing all its internal resources and\r\npotentials to implement a number of programmes and\r\nprojects. For these reasons, in the foreseeable future,\r\nexternal assistance and support will still be important for\r\nus.\r\nMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity to\r\nhighlight an innovative project known as the United Nations\r\nOne World Youth Conference Series, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral described as a “shining example”. It was initiated\r\nby the Government of Mongolia in close cooperation with\r\nthe organizations of the United Nations represented in\r\nMongolia, as well as non-governmental organizations. This\r\nproject, consisting of six national conferences, emerged as\r\nthe national response to the United Nations objectives and\r\nwas aimed at promoting and ensuring an integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation and follow-up of major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits at the national\r\nand, especially, at the local, grass-roots level. The series\r\ncovered the conferences on children, human rights,\r\npopulation, social development and women and was\r\nclosed by the national summit. All were held in 1998 and\r\n1999.\r\nYoung delegates, aged between 15 and 19, including\r\nthose with disabilities and from low-income families,\r\nparticipated in the conferences. The main purpose of these\r\nconferences, held with the direct and active participation\r\nof young people, was to raise the general public\u0027s\r\nawareness of the goals set and the commitments\r\nundertaken by Governments, to promote dialogue with the\r\ndecision makers on follow-ups and to encourage an active\r\ninvolvement of young people, civil society and the local\r\ngovernments in the implementation of the relevant\r\nnational plans of action. Hundreds of interesting, thought-\r\nprovoking and helpful ideas were proposed during these\r\nconferences.\r\nThe conference series resulted in the adoption of the\r\nnational development strategy, aptly described by the\r\nparticipants themselves as \"turning from a mosquito into\r\na busy bee\", a strategy that is being reflected in the\r\nnational policy. As a result of these conferences, and to\r\nensure follow-up, One World Clubs have been established\r\nin all 21 provinces and the capital city of Ulaanbaatar\r\nwith the aim of further expanding the project and closely\r\nmonitoring the implementation of the plans of action at\r\nthe local level. In view of the inspiring results of the One\r\nWorld Conference Series, the Government of Mongolia\r\nbelieves that other Members of the United Nations might\r\nalso find them interesting and even useful.\r\nImplementation of the Summit decisions calls for a\r\ngenuine political commitment on the part of Governments\r\nand the international community to substantially increase\r\nresources for sustainable human development. Therefore,\r\nwe reiterate our full support for the 20/20 agreement\r\nreached in Copenhagen. The resources pledged should be\r\nfully earmarked and utilized, both at national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nThe current decline in official development\r\nassistance and in contributions to the United Nations core\r\nresources is a matter of concern for Mongolia, as it is for\r\nmany other countries. As a developing landlocked country\r\nwith limited financial resources, at present Mongolia\r\nrelies to some extent on external resources for\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\ndevelopment. My delegation supports the cost-sharing\r\npractices in the United Nations system’s operational\r\nactivities and would like to re-emphasize the need to\r\nincrease core resources on a predictable, continuous and\r\nassured basis. It also favours increased non-core and\r\nearmarked funding, as well as the mobilization of private\r\nsector support.\r\nIn conclusion, may I express my delegation’s sincere\r\nhope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation\r\nof the outcome of the Summit will help generate the\r\nrenewed political will at the national and international\r\nlevels that is so needed to attain the noble objectives of\r\nsustainable human development.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): The Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World\r\nSummit for Social Development in 1995 represented an\r\nimportant consensus on the need to put people at the centre\r\nof development. Croatia joined this consensus four years\r\nago and still attaches great importance to faithful adherence\r\nto the Copenhagen commitments. By actively participating\r\nin the preparatory process for the special session on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Summit, my\r\nGovernment would like to contribute to achieving our\r\ncommon goals in fighting poverty, creating productive jobs\r\nand making a stable, safe and just society for all.\r\nThe Summit’s goals of eliminating inequality within\r\nand among States was designed to create stability and\r\nsecurity in the world, which would lead to lasting peace. In\r\nthis noble endeavour, it is necessary to focus not only on\r\nsocial and economic development exclusively, but also on\r\nthe full spectrum of development, which includes full\r\nrespect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nincluding equality between men and women.\r\nAt this juncture, more than four years after the holding\r\nof the Summit, we are in the middle of the preparations for\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly to review and\r\nevaluate the implementation of the outcome of the Summit,\r\nwhich will take place in the year 2000. The Commission\r\nfor Social Development and the preparatory Committee are\r\nleading the process in the right direction. Nevertheless, it is\r\nnecessary for all Member States to contribute to finding\r\nways to proceed further in order to accomplish the goals set\r\nat Copenhagen.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia submitted its national report,\r\nwhich provides a detailed analysis of steps taken in\r\nimplementation of the Copenhagen commitments, in the\r\nstrong desire to assist the Secretary-General in preparing a\r\ncomprehensive report to be submitted in the year 2000, as\r\nrequested by the Preparatory Committee. The special\r\nsession’s objectives are to reaffirm the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, as well as to\r\nidentify progress made and lessons learned in the\r\nimplementation at the national and international levels.\r\nFurthermore, it is to recommend concrete action towards\r\nfull and effective implementation.\r\nAlthough there have been some national and\r\ncollective efforts to fulfil the commitments made in\r\nCopenhagen, much more needs to be done. As stated in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General (A/54/220), the\r\nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social Council\r\nin 1999, in particular its high-level segment, reaffirmed\r\nthe commitment made at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment to the goal of eradicating poverty\r\nthroughout the world. Additionally, it reaffirmed the\r\ncommitment made at the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen to promote women’s economic independence and\r\nrecognized that productive employment, including the\r\nempowerment of women, plays a central role in poverty\r\neradication.\r\nThe trends are very worrying. Poverty, instead of\r\nbeing reduced, has actually increased since the holding of\r\nthe Summit, and the gap between the rich and the poor\r\ncontinues to widen. Sixty countries have been getting\r\nsteadily poorer since 1980. It is of great concern that\r\nofficial development assistance has been declining\r\ncontinuously and that only a handful of countries have\r\nachieved or surpassed the target of applying 0.7 per cent\r\nof their gross national product for such assistance.\r\nGlobalization has a capacity to do harm, but to do\r\ngood as well. Its negative consequences affect mostly the\r\npoor and vulnerable. Consideration needs to be given to\r\nwhether we need to manage its economic and social\r\nbenefits to achieve globalization with a human face.\r\nThe multilateral trading system continues to develop,\r\nbut there are some unjustified obstacles for newcomers.\r\nAlthough Croatia, together with some other countries, has\r\nconcluded all of its bilateral negotiations, it continues to\r\nbe prevented from achieving its goal of accession to the\r\nWorld Trade Organization due to a dispute between two\r\nlarge members that has nothing to do with Croatia or the\r\nmerits of its application. The circumstances are ironic\r\nwhen they are compared to the content of the ministerial\r\ncommuniqué on market access adopted by the Economic\r\nand Social Council last year, which underlined the\r\nimportance of trade liberalization. In that document a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nrenewed commitment was made to strengthen an open, rule-\r\nbased and, among other things, equitable and transparent\r\nmultilateral trade system. The artificial and arbitrary\r\nobstacle to the accession of certain States stands in sharp\r\ncontrast to these words.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to stress my Government’s belief\r\nthat the United Nations will continue to provide its valuable\r\nsupport, particularly in creating a new reality for developing\r\ncountries and countries in transition, for the purpose of their\r\nintegration into our globalized world so that all of us can\r\nenter the third millennium better prepared and with more\r\noptimism. Globalization that brings increasing global\r\ninterdependence requires, inter alia, increased international\r\ncooperation and solidarity to fulfil the commitments of the\r\nSocial Summit.\r\nMr. Dausá Céspedes (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express the support of my\r\ndelegation for the statement made by the representative of\r\nGuyana on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe Copenhagen Summit met with much scepticism in\r\nits time, particularly among third-world countries — not\r\nbecause of its goals, which were truly lofty, but because\r\nthere was serious doubt as to the possibility of truly\r\nimplementing its outcome. Nonetheless, the urgent appeal\r\nmade by the Social Summit for emergency measures to\r\naddress the very serious problems of poverty,\r\nunemployment, illiteracy and lack of basic medical care,\r\namong others — which were, and continue to be,\r\nresponsible for the increasing social marginalization in\r\nthird-world societies — was received with resolute hope.\r\nFour years later, though, we can see that poverty,\r\nrather than diminishing, is increasing. Unemployment, far\r\nfrom decreasing, is on the rise. Health, hygiene and\r\nnutrition indicators continue to deteriorate in many\r\ncountries, and literacy indicators have, in some cases, even\r\nregressed. We also note that official development assistance\r\ncontinues to decline at a time when international financial\r\ncrises and structural adjustment policies are devastating the\r\nsocieties of many developing countries.\r\nThe inequity and disparities between third-world and\r\nindustrialized countries and between high-income and\r\nunderprivileged groups throughout the planet have increased\r\nas the globalization process moves forward. It would seem\r\nthat neo-liberal globalization, which, according to its\r\nadvocates and theoreticians, was supposed to bring about\r\nprogress and well-being, is in fact globalizing injustice and\r\nsocial marginalization. The reality is that everything is\r\nbeing globalized except wealth and social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSome had believed that the Copenhagen\r\ncommitments would make it possible to globalize\r\nbrotherhood, solidarity and cooperation, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the equitable distribution of wealth and the\r\nrational use of the wealth of humanity.\r\nBut what are we to think when we see that there are\r\n4 billion poor people in the world, 1.3 billion of whom\r\nare living in conditions of absolute poverty? What social\r\nachievements are we talking about when 200 million\r\nchildren under 5 suffer from malnutrition, and 12 million\r\nof those die before even reaching that age?\r\nWhat are we to think of the fact that the infant\r\nmortality rate in developing countries is 10 times higher\r\nthan in the industrialized countries? What advances have\r\nthere been in the field of education when 130 million\r\nchildren have no access whatsoever to schools and\r\n1 billion people are illiterate, mainly in the more\r\nmarginalized areas of the developing world?\r\nIt would be difficult to explain to the growing\r\nnumber of people who live in pockets of poverty\r\nthroughout the industrialized world that in Copenhagen,\r\nfour years ago, we decided to help them and integrate\r\nthem into the framework of the tremendous social\r\ndevelopment that prevails in their countries.\r\nWe take note of the results obtained through\r\nsystemwide coordination in the United Nations in\r\nfollowing up Copenhagen. All of the efforts deployed in\r\nthis follow-up effort are clearly recapitulated and listed in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General. However, we also\r\nexpress the hope that follow-up efforts will not cease. In\r\nfact, we feel that, in our efforts to follow up Copenhagen,\r\nwe should more decisively demand greater compliance\r\nwith the commitments made at that Summit. We are\r\ncertain that this should be our greatest priority in this\r\nprocess.\r\nWe are convinced that proposing new initiatives\r\naimed at extending social development to developing\r\ncountries as well as to the marginalized sectors of\r\nindustrialized countries is not a feasible or responsible\r\noption in view of the serious failure to implement the\r\nexisting Copenhagen commitments.\r\nHow can we move beyond the Copenhagen\r\ncommitments when official development assistance has\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\ndeclined to a meagre 0.22 per cent, when assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries is increasingly conditional, and when\r\ndeveloping countries are prescribed structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes and prescriptions that take no account of social\r\npriorities or national characteristics?\r\nIn the absence of an international climate that is\r\nconducive to an increase in unconditional development\r\nassistance along with changes in the existing international\r\neconomic order, it will not be possible to devise a strategy\r\nto make headway in complying with the Social Summit’s\r\ncommitments. Only in this type of conducive environment\r\nwill developing economies be able to bring about the\r\nnecessary changes to achieve the required social progress.\r\nCuba has successfully implemented social development\r\npolicies and strategies that are based on a fairer and more\r\nequitable distribution of wealth. This has enabled our\r\ncountry to achieve satisfactory results in terms of the\r\nCopenhagen commitments.\r\nFor instance, 100 per cent of Cuba’s population has\r\naccess to free health care and education; life expectancy at\r\nbirth is 75 years; and the infant mortality rate is 7.1 for\r\nevery 1,000 live births. One hundred per cent of our\r\nchildren are protected against 11 preventable diseases, and\r\nthere is one doctor for every 169 inhabitants. One out of\r\nevery five Cubans is a student, and we have more than\r\n600,000 university graduates.\r\nIn 1998 Cuba allocated 41 per cent of its budget to\r\nsocial services.\r\nClearly, the priority that the Cuban Government has\r\ngiven to social action and its commitment to increasing the\r\nwell-being of its population have been important factors in\r\nraising social indicators to a level that exceeds those of\r\nmany countries with much higher levels of development\r\nand far greater resources. It has done all of this despite the\r\nnegative impact on our country of the economic war being\r\nwaged by the North American Government and of the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade that it has\r\nimposed on us, which has resulted in economic losses to\r\nthe people of Cuba of more than $60 billion.\r\nCuba is prepared to share its experiences and to\r\ncontribute, as it always has, to fostering solidarity and\r\ncooperation. The Cuban Government attaches high priority\r\nto promoting and participating in international efforts to\r\nimplement the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit.\r\nIf we fail to promote cooperation and solidarity, it\r\nwill be impossible to progress towards a world of social\r\njustice for all. Cuba’s experience has shown that to be the\r\ncase. More than 25,000 Cuban health professionals have\r\noffered their services to the third world. Today, 200\r\nCuban doctors are serving under a new programme to\r\nprovide medical services absolutely free of charge, which\r\nwe are carrying out in the poorest African countries\r\nwhere conditions are at their most difficult. No fewer than\r\n3,000 Cuban doctors are available to our African brothers\r\nunder the terms of that programme. Similarly, in Central\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, a further 1,200 Cuban\r\ndoctors and health-care specialists are offering their\r\nservices.\r\nSome 2,000 students from Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean are studying to become doctors in the Latin\r\nAmerican School of Medicine. In a few months that\r\nnumber will have risen to 3,000, and in three years it will\r\nhave risen to 6,000. We are working to set up medical\r\nschools in Africa staffed by Cuban professors who will\r\nteach free of charge so as to prepare health-care personnel\r\nfor work in the field in countries in African countries.\r\nCuba will have the privilege and the tremendous\r\nhonour of hosting the South Summit to be held in April\r\n2000, which will bring together the leaders of the Group\r\nof 77. This outstanding event will be of great importance\r\nin preparing developing countries to confront the\r\nchallenges of the new millennium with regard to access\r\nto development, the eradication of poverty, defending our\r\ncultures and the taking of global decisions that affect\r\neveryone.\r\nAt a time when there is no further justification for\r\ncold wars, arms races or enormous military expenditure,\r\nwe should ask ourselves what is keeping us from\r\nallocating all of those resources to promoting the social\r\nand economic development of developing countries. For\r\nhumanity there are no alternatives. Tomorrow it will be\r\ntoo late to do what we should have done long ago.\r\nMr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme at the outset to convey to you, Sir, the congratulations\r\nof my delegation on your election to preside over the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. Your major tasks will\r\ninclude tackling the important social agenda of the\r\nfollow-ups to the World Conference on Women and the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development during the special\r\nsessions planned for next year. It is encouraging to know\r\nthat those processes will be guided by a distinguished\r\nrepresentative of Africa, whose qualities as a diplomat\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nwhose integrity, experience and wisdom will lead the work\r\nof this Assembly to a successful outcome.\r\nI should also like to express my gratitude and that of\r\nmy delegation to Switzerland for the human, financial and\r\nintellectual resources that, as host country, it has made\r\navailable for the special session of the General Assembly\r\non the follow-up to the Social Summit. We pay tribute to\r\nSwitzerland for its generosity, which is aimed specifically\r\nat ensuring that Geneva 2000 will be successful in terms of\r\nboth its outcome and the level at which the international\r\ncommunity participates and is represented.\r\nThis debate is being held in the context of resolution\r\n52/25, which established parameters for the follow-up\r\nprocess and for the review of the implementation of the\r\ncommitments undertaken at the Social Summit, in\r\nconformity with the decisions of this Assembly with regard\r\nto a periodic and overall review of the major world\r\nConferences that have taken place during this decade that\r\nis now drawing to a close.\r\nIn this context, the General Assembly’s Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the special session on the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the Social Summit, over which I have the\r\nhonour to preside, held its first substantive session last\r\nMay. Subsequently, it held brief informal consultations at\r\nthe beginning of September.\r\nHaving overcome certain initial difficulties typical of\r\nsuch processes, the Preparatory Committee is now on track\r\nand has adopted important decisions with regard to the very\r\nspecific requirements of the United Nations system\r\nconcerning accreditation and participation for non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. Fulfilling a unique aspect of its\r\nresponsibilities, the Committee has also carried out its first\r\noverview of possible new initiatives.\r\nThe most important and complex part of the process\r\nis yet to come. We still have to negotiate the texts that,\r\ntogether with the tasks allocated to the Commission for\r\nSocial Development concerning the assessment of and\r\nfollow-up to the commitments undertaken at Copenhagen,\r\nwill be the main outcome of the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. At the same time, as we have embarked\r\non the follow-up process, this important debate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly will provide Member States with an\r\nopportunity to express their ideas about the future tasks of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee, its priorities, and the best ways\r\nin which to achieve a successful outcome. Of particular\r\ninterest will be members’ opinions on how new realities,\r\nboth national and international, are affecting the problem of\r\nsocial development — a problem that is almost structural\r\nin nature.\r\nThat is a significant point because, as has been said\r\nmany times, the intention of the Copenhagen Summit was\r\nnot to define social development rigidly, but rather to take\r\nsteps towards equitable and progressive social\r\ndevelopment on the basis of three central elements:\r\npoverty, employment and social integration. In that sense,\r\nthe Social Summit was remarkably successful in\r\nachieving a political commitment to place social\r\ndevelopment at the highest possible level nationally and\r\ninternationally, thereby giving significant momentum to\r\nthe perception that progress cannot be measured\r\nexclusively in terms of growth and productivity.\r\nThus, the Secretary-General has pointed out, the\r\nSocial Summit contributed significantly to consolidating\r\nthe perception — which, though now generally accepted,\r\nhas yet to be completely translated into effective\r\npolicies — that the price of macroeconomic adjustments\r\nshould not be paid by the poorest sectors. It is essential\r\nto maintain social expenditure when budgets are being\r\ncut; that is an important step towards achieving effective\r\nsocial policies for building stable and fair societies.\r\nAt the same time, however, in the period since the\r\nSocial Summit took place, we have observed that there\r\nremain serious obstacles to achieving its objectives,\r\ndespite the earnest and sustained efforts made by many\r\ncountries, especially developing countries, to eradicate\r\npoverty and bring about full employment and social\r\nintegration. At the domestic level, there is a particular\r\nresponsibility to maintain a constant balance between\r\nfiscal austerity measures and the need to find the\r\nresources required to fund social policies, while not\r\nignoring other issues, especially the lack of fiscal\r\ndiscipline and macroeconomic stability, inadequate social\r\npolicies and difficulties in broadening the participation of\r\nthe various sectors of society.\r\nAt the international level, no one can deny that the\r\nenabling environment for development has deteriorated.\r\nThe process of globalization, which in general is positive,\r\nhas also resulted in inequality and marginalization, and no\r\nmeasures or institutions have yet been put in place to\r\ncorrect those effects, which have aggravated social\r\nproblems between countries and within societies. In\r\naddition, problems have persisted concerning market\r\naccess for the products of developing countries,\r\ninternational financial instability and the coordination of\r\nthe macroeconomic policies of the industrialized\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\ncountries. Furthermore, these developments are taking place\r\nat a time of change, both ideological and systemic —\r\nsometimes accompanied by violence — in many parts of\r\nthe international community.\r\nBut there has been no suitable response to people’s\r\neveryday concerns. To some extent, we are losing sight of\r\nthe fact that political, humanitarian and financial crises have\r\nserious social consequences that have a particularly harsh\r\nimpact at the community level long after necessary and\r\nwelcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in\r\nspecific areas.\r\nIn short, the main reasons for convening the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, as set out in the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, could\r\nhave been formulated today — with the addition of the\r\nsocial consequences of the financial crisis. Such is the\r\nvalidity of those concepts and, unfortunately, such is the\r\nlack of measures to improve the situation they describe. We\r\nhave thus concluded that the key to meeting the challenges\r\nwe face and to resolving our problems lies in our approach\r\nand policy choices, and in paying careful attention to the\r\ndirection and objectives we identify. That is also why we\r\nconsider it necessary to address our tasks with a balanced\r\nand inclusive approach on the basis of long-term, action-\r\noriented commitments.\r\nWith that in mind, let us consider the path that lies\r\nahead for the Preparatory Committee. One of the new\r\ntopics that has emerged in our deliberations relates to\r\nidentifying valid principles and sound practices for social\r\npolicy. I must say at the outset that this concept could be\r\nconfusing, because the Copenhagen agreements are an\r\nethical expression of our right to a secure, stable and\r\ndignified life, whereas they basically define sound\r\nprinciples for social policy. The task of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee is thus not to formulate such principles but, on\r\nthe basis of the commitments, to develop the ongoing\r\nprocess of transforming them into specific policies suited to\r\nthe particular situation in each country.\r\nHere I must note that the sound principles arising from\r\nthe social Summit apply to all members of the international\r\ncommunity without distinction between industrialized and\r\ndeveloping countries; they must be applied to all if they are\r\nto be truly effective. The outcome of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee’s deliberations on this topic must be a\r\nsignificant component of a new international financial\r\narchitecture.\r\nAt its special session the General Assembly will\r\nhave to adopt the goal of reducing by one half the\r\npercentage of those living in extreme poverty by 2015;\r\nthis goal must become a commitment at the national level\r\nand a mandate for international institutions if we are to\r\nformulate the necessary global strategies.\r\nOn employment, the special session will have to give\r\nvigorous political impetus to the creation of a global\r\nstrategy, under the leadership of the International Labour\r\nOrganization and its tripartite structures for participation,\r\nwhich will lay the foundations for the sustained creation\r\nof productive employment in the future. Growth in job-\r\ncreation is the principal way out of poverty, and will\r\nstrengthen social integration. Hence the critical\r\nimportance of this matter in our deliberations.\r\nThe June 2000 session will have to pay special\r\nattention to the economic and social situation in Africa.\r\nNew initiatives in line with commitment 7 of the social\r\nSummit must be aimed at making a real difference in the\r\nconditions in that region. It may be possible to consider\r\nthe possibility that African countries could set national\r\ntimetables for growth in basic education, for\r\nimprovements in health and for related measures. As a\r\ncomplement, donor countries and international agencies\r\nwould increase resources and technical assistance in these\r\nareas. We are carefully observing ongoing developments\r\non debt reduction for the heavily indebted poor countries;\r\nthe Preparatory Committee is ready to make whatever\r\ncontribution is necessary for this process.\r\nThe question of resources for social development is\r\na Gordian knot whose complexities lie both at the\r\nnational and the international levels; it must be addressed\r\nduring the preparatory process, when all its diverse\r\nelements must be considered. Any possible results should\r\ncontribute to the ongoing debate on development\r\nfinancing.\r\nWe must give special attention to following up the\r\nresults achieved at Geneva next June, with a particular\r\neye to translating the agreements from the global\r\nperspective of the General Assembly to their regional and\r\nnational dimensions, with a view to consolidating a\r\npolitical culture in favour of social progress, to use the\r\nphrase employed at the Copenhagen meeting that marked\r\nthe beginning of the social Summit. Here, the regional\r\ncommissions could be mandated to work with Member\r\nStates to prepare an integrated follow-up of what was\r\nagreed not only at the social Summit but also at the other\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nmajor conferences; such follow-up would be adapted to the\r\nindividual characteristics of each region.\r\nThese are only some of the many tasks before the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. At the national level, it will be no easy\r\nmatter to prioritize valid interests within the purview of\r\ncountries, given insufficient resources. Something similar\r\ntakes place at the international level, which sometimes\r\nreflects what happens within countries with respect to the\r\nlimited availability of resources and conflicting priorities.\r\nThat is why the Copenhagen meeting was held at the level\r\nof heads of State: at summit level it was possible to take\r\nthe kind of decisions that are normally addressed at the\r\nnational level. This premise remains valid with respect to\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly; for that reason\r\nwe urge States to participate at the highest possible level at\r\nGeneva next June. The special session may in turn may be\r\nan opportunity for the international community to rebuild\r\nthe foundations of a common understanding of what good\r\nthings have been lost both at the national and at the\r\ninternational levels.\r\nHence, because of its complex mandate, the scope of\r\nthe agreements it may adopt and the ethical imperatives it\r\nmust face up to, the special session of the General\r\nAssembly on the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nsocial Summit will be the third pillar in terms of\r\nimportance, joining the negotiations on a new financial\r\narchitecture and the Millennium Round of trade negotiations\r\nunder the auspices of the World Trade Organization. I hope\r\neveryone will understand it in that way.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam): Allow me at the\r\noutset to express my support for the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nMy delegation welcomes this timely debate, since the\r\nspecial session on the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and further\r\ninitiatives is fast approaching. In that connection, my\r\ndelegation highly appreciates the ongoing preparatory\r\nprocess for the special session undertaken by United\r\nNations Member States, organizations and agencies.\r\nViet Nam fully shares the principles and goals set out\r\nat the World Summit for Social Development. In Viet Nam,\r\nsocial development has always been a priority on the\r\nnational agenda since Viet Nam regained its independence.\r\nHowever, for many decades our efforts in this field have\r\nbeen severely hampered by the backwardness of the\r\neconomy and by wars, among other things. The wars not\r\nonly took away human and physical resources, but also\r\nleft behind serious consequences to overcome. The\r\npresent fierce competition in the process of globalization\r\nand the negative impacts of the regional financial crisis,\r\nadd to those obstacles.\r\nIn that context, Viet Nam has endeavoured to\r\nimplement the 10 commitments of the social Summit.\r\nViet Nam’s economy has experienced high rates of\r\ngrowth in the 1990s, averaging 8 per cent per year\r\nbetween 1990 and 1997. The proportion of the State\r\nbudget allocated for social programmes is continuously\r\nincreased, reaching 17.3 per cent in 1997. The\r\nVietnamese Government has issued sets of policies and\r\nmeasures to develop the economy and stabilize the socio-\r\npolitical situation, some of which I shall now highlight.\r\nAmong the priorities in building a suitable\r\nenvironment for social development, we place the utmost\r\nimportance on the development of a legal framework,\r\nincluding the promulgation and implementation of very\r\nimportant laws, such as the labour code, the law on\r\nchildren’s care and protection, the education law and the\r\nordinances on the disabled and the ageing. Measures to\r\ndemocratize and enhance the effectiveness of the State\r\nand Government organs have been undertaken throughout\r\nthe country. National targeted programmes for social\r\ndevelopment have been worked out and annually\r\nreviewed by the Government to ensure effective\r\nimplementation.\r\nPoverty alleviation programmes have been designed\r\nfor, and implemented in, many provinces. Local people\r\nare increasingly engaged in the formulation of such\r\nprogrammes, in accordance with their own conditions and\r\nneeds. Special attention in terms of microcredit and the\r\nprovision of production guidance is given to the poor\r\npeople living in remote or mountainous areas and\r\ncommunities with extreme poverty. On average, the\r\npoverty proportion is reduced by 1.5 to 2 per cent\r\nannually.\r\nIn the face of a very high and increasing\r\nunemployment rate, which was about 6.85 per cent in\r\n1998, the Government of Viet Nam has approved a\r\nnational employment programme aimed at creating\r\nannually between 1.3 and 1.4 million new jobs, reducing\r\nthe urban unemployment rate to 5 per cent and increasing\r\nthe proportion of vocationally trained workers to 22 per\r\ncent by 2000. To realize those employment targets, we\r\nfocus on developing a household and plantation economy,\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nas well as high-tech industrial zones, small, medium- and\r\nlarge-scale enterprises and linking vocational training with\r\nthe requirements of production and the labour market.\r\nImprovement of basic social services provision is\r\nanother priority. The State budget allocations for education,\r\nhealth care services, population and family planning, safe\r\nwater and sanitation have been increased steadily, reaching\r\n9.1 per cent in 1997. Besides those social services, Viet\r\nNam has maintained a policy of assisting people who made\r\na great contribution to the nation’s wars for national\r\nindependence and those belonging to disadvantaged groups\r\nor groups with special needs and vulnerability. Viet Nam is\r\nstrongly supportive of the implementation of the 20/20\r\ninitiative, considering this to be a feasible approach to\r\ninvesting in human capital. In October 1998, with the\r\nassistance of several international organizations and the\r\nco-sponsorship of the Government of Norway, the\r\nGovernment of Viet Nam hosted an international meeting,\r\nwhich reviewed the implementation of the 20/20 initiative\r\nand adopted the Hanoi Consensus.\r\nViet Nam’s experience shows that sustainable social\r\ndevelopment is based on political stability, economic\r\ndevelopment and social justice. Successful implementation\r\nof the social policies is due to the fact that these policies\r\nmeet people’s aspirations and that the people respond to\r\nthem. It is important to optimally mobilize and utilize all\r\nnational potential, based on the leading role of the\r\nGovernment and the participation in social development of\r\nevery individual, organization and economic sector. The\r\nGovernment must place the goals of social development at\r\nthe centre of economic policy-making, even in times of\r\ndifficulty.\r\nInternational cooperation plays no less important a role\r\nin this endeavour. Yet in the world today the immense\r\npressure generated by the process of globalization and\r\nmarket mechanisms has been seriously affecting socio-\r\neconomic development in many countries. For the\r\ndeveloping and least developed countries, the continuous\r\nfall of official development assistance, piling up of external\r\ndebt, decline in their ability to get access to the global\r\nmarket for their limited exports, plus new conditionalities\r\non export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted\r\nconstraints. It is all the more imperative to create a more\r\njust and cooperative world economic order to support\r\nnational efforts for social and economic development.\r\nMr. Yamazaki (Japan): At the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development in 1995 the international community\r\nsucceeded in generating great momentum towards the\r\nrealization of the idea of placing people at the centre of\r\ndevelopment. My delegation would like to reaffirm the\r\nsignificance of the outcome of the Summit and also\r\nexpress its sincere appreciation for the leadership of the\r\nGovernment of Chile and of the Secretary-General. It is\r\nas a result of their sustained efforts, along with the\r\ncooperation of many countries, that this subject is now on\r\nthe global agenda.\r\nDuring the four short years since Copenhagen the\r\nworld has faced its share of problems, such as regional\r\nconflicts, international and domestic economic crises and\r\nnatural disasters. Due to their urgent nature, we Member\r\ncountries of the United Nations have done our best to\r\ncooperate in coping with them in the short term.\r\nHowever, in the medium- to long-term, these problems\r\nhave a major bearing upon social development, including\r\non our efforts to eradicate poverty, achieve full\r\nemployment and promote social integration. All these\r\nrequire us to strengthen our efforts to promote social\r\ndevelopment. From this point of view, Japan welcomes\r\nthe decision of the General Assembly to hold the special\r\nsession next year, which will make it possible to mobilize\r\nthe wisdom of the world on this matter.\r\nJapan also strongly supports the idea of human-\r\ncentred development, which is the fundamental principle\r\nof the Copenhagen Declaration. We also believe that the\r\nfollow-up process should stress the realization of a\r\nhuman-centred millennium.\r\nIn the general debate on 21 September\r\nMr. Masahiko Koumura, Foreign Minister of Japan,\r\nemphasized the importance of addressing a range of\r\nissues by focusing on human security. He called for the\r\nprotection of the dignity and life of every person against\r\nthe numerous threats posed, for example, by poverty, the\r\noutflow of refugees, environmental degradation, infectious\r\ndiseases like AIDS, human rights violations, anti-\r\npersonnel land mines and small arms, terrorism and\r\nnatural disasters. Thus, Japan advocates making human\r\nsecurity a more central focus in order to induce the\r\ninternational community to pay more attention to these\r\nproblems. Japan also believes that this approach, which\r\naims at realizing human potential and enhancing the\r\nquality of life, reflects the idea of human-centred\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTo ensure human security and address the core\r\nissues of social development — to eradicate poverty and\r\nachieve full employment and social integration — Japan\r\nbelieves that it is crucial to enhance individual self-\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nreliance. To this end, Governments concerned should\r\nstrengthen their efforts to develop human capacity; improve\r\naccess to products and basic social services; enhance\r\nsupport for civil society, including non-governmental\r\norganizations; and adopt a participatory approach. It goes\r\nwithout saying that in their doing so special attention\r\nshould be given to the empowerment of women and\r\nassisting the poor.\r\nI also would like to point out the importance of\r\nestablishing a new partnership with other actors. We\r\nacknowledge that the primary responsibility for social\r\ndevelopment lies with States. However, it is necessary for\r\nthe relevant non-State actors in civil society — especially\r\nnon-governmental organizations, volunteers and the private\r\nsector — to help create such a partnership; government\r\ncannot do it alone. Furthermore, the countries themselves\r\nmust take the lead both in establishing individual national\r\nplans and in implementing them effectively, each country\r\naddressing the specific conditions it faces. Great importance\r\nshould be attached to this idea of ownership.\r\nFinally, I would like to single out the importance of\r\ninternational cooperation, in order to help the countries\r\nconcerned enhance individual self-reliance, shape new\r\npartnerships and create ownership, which are vital elements\r\nfor achieving human-centred development.\r\nIt is on the basis of these views that the Government\r\nof Japan has made efforts at the regional and international\r\nlevels to advance social development. Last October the\r\nsecond Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment (TICAD II) succeeded in giving greater\r\nimpetus to the economic and social development of Africa,\r\nbased on African ownership and partnership with the\r\ninternational community. Japan also organized an\r\ninternational symposium, “Development: With a special\r\nfocus on human security”, held in June in Tokyo. The\r\nissues discussed were poverty eradication, health care, the\r\ndevelopment of Africa and their implications for human\r\nsecurity.\r\nFurthermore, based on the recognition that regional\r\nefforts are also important in the preparatory process for the\r\nspecial session, my Government is actively participating in\r\ndiscussions such as the International Labour Organization’s\r\nAsian regional meeting, which was held in January. I assure\r\nall delegations that Japan intends to make a positive\r\ncontribution to the special session, sharing the experience\r\nit has gained with these initiatives.\r\nThe new millennium lies just around the corner. I\r\nrepeat that in order to achieve the goals of social\r\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century all States must\r\ncooperate in pursuing the common interests of the\r\ninternational community. My delegation sincerely hopes\r\nthat a successful outcome will be enjoyed at the special\r\nsession as a result of constructive discussions in the\r\nPreparatory Committee and in the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nMr. Sutoyo (Indonesia): When the international\r\ncommunity convened the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in 1995 it was with the most noble intention\r\nand determination to resolve once and for all the ills of\r\npoverty and destitution. It was to give social development\r\nand human well-being, both then and into the twenty-first\r\ncentury, the highest priority. The hope was to improve the\r\nhuman condition throughout the world and to respond\r\nwith substantive, tangible actions to belief in the dignity\r\nand value of human life.\r\nAs a consequence of this venture, and because of the\r\ngenuine good intentions of Member States, the\r\ninternational community crafted its convictions into a set\r\nof commitments that, when fulfilled, were to usher in a\r\nnew era of humanitarianism and prosperity. And let us\r\nremember that the tasks on which the international\r\ncommunity embarked are by no means small, or easily\r\nachieved. They are global and of great complexity. My\r\ndelegation has no doubt that in the long run the goals of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development will be\r\nreached and the commitments will be fulfilled.\r\nHaving said that, I am compelled to note, even\r\nthough only four years have passed since Copenhagen,\r\nthat my delegation had hoped more would have been\r\nachieved by now. We had hoped that a perceptible trend\r\nwould have emerged and that this trend would strengthen\r\nour confidence in the Summit and lend encouragement as\r\nwe tackle the difficult tasks ahead. We had hoped that\r\nsome measure of success would be evident in the war on\r\npoverty. On the contrary, however, there is still little to\r\nshow in the way of progress, and in fact poverty has\r\nincreased in many parts of the world, along with\r\nunemployment. Today, over a billion people remain\r\nimpoverished. One and a half billion lack safe drinking\r\nwater. Social integration remains elusive.\r\nIt is clear today that the onset of globalization and\r\ntrade liberalization have not been to the benefit of all\r\ncountries, and that many developing countries are ill-\r\nprepared to meet the challenges and reap the rewards of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\na global economy. Recent events certainly attest to that.\r\nAnd despite signs of stabilization in financial markets,\r\neconomic growth during this past year alone has been\r\ninsufficient to support the necessary social programmes and\r\nactivities that are required to meaningfully follow up the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development. Employment,\r\nwages and social development programmes are slow to\r\nrecover, and it will be some time before momentum is\r\nregained.\r\nThe experience of the past two years leads us to\r\nconclude that what is urgently needed is a redesign of the\r\ninternational financial architecture. We need only to follow\r\nthe actions prescribed at Copenhagen. They include\r\nachieving a higher degree of stability in financial markets,\r\nreducing the risk of financial crisis, improving the stability\r\nof exchange rates, stabilizing interest rates and striving for\r\nlow real interest rates in the long run, and reducing the\r\nuncertainties of financial flows.\r\nLikewise, the current state of international trade should\r\nbe reviewed with the aim of boosting the exports of\r\ndeveloping countries. International markets must be opened\r\nto the exports of developing countries as a prerequisite to\r\ngenerating employment in these countries and providing the\r\nreal wages necessary to overcome poverty. Any new trade\r\nnegotiations should therefore take the interests of the\r\ndeveloping countries fully into account. At the same time,\r\nevery effort should be made to enhance capacity-building\r\nand improve trade infrastructure in developing countries. As\r\nwe prepare for the tenth session of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X), the\r\nspecial session could reaffirm the role of this body as the\r\nprincipal forum in the United Nations for trade and related\r\nissues, and for developing strategies consistent with the\r\nSummit goals.\r\nAt the same time, we must continue forward in\r\nreducing the debt burdens of developing countries and\r\nincreasing financing for development. I am encouraged by\r\nrecent initiatives for debt relief and also by several remarks\r\nthat have been made recently regarding debt forgiveness.\r\nDebt relief needs to be implemented without delay so as to\r\nfree financial resources for social and economic\r\ndevelopment. At the same time, it is important to move in\r\nthe direction of the target set for official development\r\nassistance, not the reverse. Private investment cannot\r\nreplace this source of financing, as the risk is now all too\r\nclear.\r\nIn the four years since the Summit, the developing\r\ncountries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and\r\nfinancial cooperation for development that was committed\r\nand certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid,\r\nbroad-based sustainable development. It is in fact\r\nsomewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress\r\nmade in follow-up activities when the economic picture\r\ntoday is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit. I\r\nbelieve that the time has passed when mere discussion of\r\ninitiatives and experiences gained can do justice to those\r\nwe represent.\r\nThe forthcoming special session should therefore be\r\nan occasion for a frank discussion of the obstacles to\r\nimplementation, of the failure of the international\r\ncommunity to effectively assist developing countries in\r\neradicating poverty, and of how we are to get back on\r\ntrack. This necessarily includes a settlement of the\r\nproblem of financing for development and action in such\r\nareas as trade and debt. The Preparatory Committee has\r\nmade a number of useful recommendations, which\r\nIndonesia supports and which we hope will receive more\r\nthan rhetorical attention. Also among the\r\nrecommendations is facilitating the transfer of technology,\r\nknowledge and information to developing countries. I\r\nwould underscore the importance of this if the developing\r\ncountries hope to avoid complete and total\r\nmarginalization from the shift towards a knowledge-based\r\neconomy.\r\nLet me note that Indonesia remains confident that\r\nthe international economic environment will improve and\r\nultimately provide the necessary stimulus for social\r\ndevelopment. I am confident that the lessons of the past\r\nwill be translated into effective policy for the future. The\r\nspecial session, being held at the close of a financial\r\ncrisis, offers us yet another opportunity to give meaning\r\nto our rhetoric and to set the course for future action. In\r\nthat process, however, I would caution that the events of\r\nthe past two years should not become a pretext for\r\nmoving from social development to social engineering.\r\nPoverty will be overcome only with a true and\r\ngenuine commitment to providing the poor of the world\r\nwith access to credit, financial resources and the means\r\nfor sustainable development. The plight of the poor will\r\nbe further exacerbated if hunger and starvation are\r\naddressed only within a uniform, politically correct\r\ncontext.\r\nMr. Tudela (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I would like\r\nat the outset to join previous speakers in reiterating our\r\ncongratulations on Mr. Gurirab’s election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly. We feel convinced that, under his\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nleadership, we will be able to achieve the goals that we\r\nhave set ourselves for the proper development of the\r\ndifferent and important items on the agenda of this\r\nAssembly at fifty-fourth sessions.\r\nI wish now to refer to item 37 of the agenda,\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development”. In this context, my delegation wishes\r\nto associate itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Mexico on behalf of the Rio Group.\r\nIn 1995, the international community, represented by\r\n186 countries, assumed the challenge of fighting poverty,\r\ncreating productive employment and reinforcing the social\r\nfabric. By these means, we placed the individual at the\r\ncentre of development and raised the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration on Social Development and the Programme of\r\nAction to the level of a global commitment. We then\r\nreturned to the idea that the care of the human individual\r\nwas an essential direction for development and that the\r\nrighting of social imbalances would allow progress to be\r\nachieved in the search for sustainable human development.\r\nYet again, investment in quality education, nutrition\r\nand health, the creation of equal opportunity conditions and\r\nthe establishment of incentives to raise production and\r\nproductivity became the main subject of a worldwide\r\ndebate. In this sense, the Copenhagen Summit was a step\r\nforward in the joint effort to address economic stability\r\nwith the creation of better living conditions for all people.\r\nThis effort was recorded in the decision of the international\r\ncommunity to hold a number of world conferences under\r\nUnited Nations auspices that would allow consensus to\r\ndevelop on certain values and goals for defining specific\r\nactions in certain areas of worldwide concern and interest.\r\nToday, four years later, it is only fair to acknowledge\r\nthe importance of the Copenhagen documents, which have\r\nserved as the basis on which Governments, civil society and\r\nthe international financing agencies have established social\r\ndevelopment as a substantive element in the development\r\nof our countries. This entails the forthright recognition that\r\npoverty reduction also involves the elimination of its\r\nconsequences, allowing the economic structure of a country\r\nto enjoy an ongoing and consistent organizational and\r\ninstitutional system.\r\nTo battle poverty face to face demands in equal\r\nmeasure the existence of solid institutions, adequate\r\nfinancing resources, specific programmes to identify the\r\nareas of poverty, and the unwavering political will of\r\nGovernments.\r\nIn Latin America, and specifically in Peru, we have\r\ncome to understand the development of this concept and\r\nits effective implementation. There have been distinctly\r\ndifferent approaches to drawing up and implementing\r\nsocial policies. This has been due to the natural\r\ndifferences in the development and integration of\r\ncountries into the international economy and, obviously,\r\nto their capacity to respond to the new phenomena\r\ngenerated by the international system.\r\nIn the specific case of Peru, the basic goal for the\r\nperiod 1996-2000 was the reduction of the percentage of\r\nthe population living in extreme poverty by 50 per cent,\r\nfrom 19.3 per cent in 1995 to 10 per cent by the year\r\n2000. The focused strategy of the campaign against\r\nextreme poverty that was created for this purpose gave\r\npriority to caring, by means of assistance programmes, for\r\nthe vulnerable groups of the population, such as children\r\nunder five, pregnant women, senior citizens and people\r\nwho had been displaced by terrorism.\r\nIn this context, in the context of our own economic\r\ndevelopment, over the past year we have decided to\r\nemphasize the generation of productive employment,\r\ntaking into consideration the new tendencies of the market\r\nand adapting the skills of our human capital to the new\r\nlabour demands. In the years to come, for economies with\r\na relative average development, the subject of\r\nemployment, which was included as a commitment in\r\nCopenhagen, will be essential to overcoming the link\r\nbetween poverty, low productivity and insufficient levels\r\nof skilled human capital. We are seeking in this way to\r\nobtain, on the one hand, a multiplier effect on the\r\neconomy and, on the other, to endow our citizens with\r\nuseful tools for their human development.\r\nIn that regard, implementation of Peru’s economic\r\nand social policies seeks, directly and indirectly, to bring\r\nabout the inclusion of the most impoverished sectors in\r\nsociety and to make them active agents in the country\u0027s\r\ndevelopment. For that reason, Peru\u0027s commitment with\r\nregard to the Copenhagen Summit is not circumstantial;\r\nrather, it is directly related to a permanent State policy.\r\nIn recent years, within the framework of the\r\nCommission for Social Development, we have held a\r\nconstructive debate and a detailed review of the\r\nCopenhagen outcome. We believe that this work has been\r\nimportant in providing States with conclusions that are\r\nrelevant to our work, particularly as suggestions for\r\npolicies that can be implemented in our countries. Last\r\nMay we participated in the initial work of the Preparatory\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nCommittee on Copenhagen + 5, chaired by Ambassador\r\nCristián Maquieira of Chile. This was a complex task, as all\r\nthe other reviews of the outcomes of world conferences\r\nhave been and will continue to be, insofar as they are\r\nlinked to the most important concerns of States. We are\r\nsure that we will be able to reaffirm the Copenhagen\r\ncommitments and deal with them in depth. Within that\r\nframework, we must state that the diversity of the social\r\ndomain and the acknowledgement of our countries\u0027 different\r\ndegrees of development should serve specifically to forge\r\ncommon positions that result in the adoption of initiatives\r\nfor greater and better implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nProgramme of Action. Entering into a debate that poses a\r\ncontradiction between economic and social affairs will\r\nalways have a negative impact on the initiatives that the\r\ninternational community must adopt in Geneva next year.\r\nSimilarly, emphasizing a single aspect that responds only to\r\na specific or regional situation would diminish the\r\nimportance of the results of our work.\r\nGenerally speaking, we can say, to the contrary, that\r\ndeveloped and developing countries have now adopted\r\nsocial and economic policies whose nature responds to\r\nsimilar concepts or models. The acknowledgement of this\r\nelement is essential in order to incorporate social policies\r\ninto development plans so that they will be not only\r\ninseparable from but also in conformity with the current\r\nrealities of the international economy.\r\nWe are aware of the importance of the Copenhagen\r\n+ 5 process and of the review of the implementation of the\r\ncommitments adopted in 1995. We also believe that the\r\nvery development of our countries over the past five years\r\ndemonstrates the importance of continuously debating and\r\nreviewing its content, as well as of adopting follow-up\r\nmeasures for their better implementation. In that regard, we\r\nfeel that there already exists a sense of responsibility\r\namong the international community to undertake the task of\r\nsocial development and providing for the well-being of\r\nhumanity.\r\nMr. Naber (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to extend to the President our sincere thanks for\r\nsteering our deliberations and to the participants for\r\nenriching our discussions aimed at exchanging views on the\r\nassessment of progress in the implementation of the\r\ncommitments made at the Copenhagen Summit. I would\r\nlike to highlight some new challenges that we face so that\r\nwe can achieve our desired goals.\r\nThe subjects discussed at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, held four years ago, have re-emerged in a\r\nforceful and an urgent manner. The economic,\r\ntechnological and informatics gaps between developed\r\nand developing countries are being further widened for\r\nimportant reasons, including, inter alia, declining rates of\r\nforeign investment flows to developing countries; the\r\nheavy debt burden under which developing countries are\r\nlanguishing, which has reached $2.2 billion; declining\r\nofficial development assistance, in absolute and relative\r\nterms, which has reached its lowest level in 50 years; and\r\nimbalances in the international economic order, which\r\nhave adversely affected developing countries’ economies\r\nand have negatively affected their social indexes and\r\nbasic services.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the review of\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development. We hope for the fulfilment of\r\ncommitments made by heads of States and Prime\r\nMinisters in support of employment, eradication of\r\npoverty and the creation of an enabling environment for\r\ndeveloping countries so that they can achieve social\r\nintegration and fulfil commitments related to education\r\nand health care. This in turn would have an impact on\r\noverall economic indicators. My delegation hopes that the\r\nspecial session will be an effective forum to reinvigorate\r\nefforts and pursue further initiatives to honour the\r\ncommitments undertaken at Copenhagen, to reaffirm the\r\nhumanitarian dimension of development and to curb\r\nDarwinian economic phenomena, whose tragedies are\r\nembodied in the deteriorating social situations in a\r\nnumber of countries and the marginalization of entire\r\nsocieties.\r\nMy country is fully convinced that States play a\r\ngreat role in activating social development at the local\r\nlevel and in creating an enabling environment, thus\r\nimplementing the Copenhagen commitments by placing\r\nsocial development on a strong foundation of human\r\nrights, non-discrimination, pursuit of equal opportunities\r\nand the realization of social justice.\r\nJordan is doing its best, in cooperation with civil\r\nsociety institutions and through open dialogue with all\r\ncompetent authorities, to reinvigorate democratic\r\ndevelopment in the country by enhancing transparency,\r\nperformance and political pluralism through appropriate\r\nlegal infrastructures that provide opportunities for social\r\nintegration and participation. Being aware of the\r\nimportance of access to information, and by engaging in\r\nan ongoing policy dialogue with all sectors of society, we\r\nhave opened the door to information flow through both\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\nthe print media and the Internet, which is widely used. We\r\nhave also adopted a policy of open, transnational and\r\nunrestricted visual mass media.\r\nIn dealing with its environment, Jordan has always\r\nbeen keen to pursue policies of dialogue and openness in\r\norder to activate peace and security, the pillars of socio-\r\neconomic development in a region that has been suffering\r\nfrom terrible crises since the beginning of this century.\r\nMoreover, we continue to apply this approach through\r\ndomestic legislation and policies, as demonstrated by our\r\nadherence to 18 human rights conventions. Despite our\r\nlimited resources, we continue to endeavour to create a\r\nconducive environment for social integration.\r\nFor 50 years, Jordan has stood as a model. Through\r\nthe enhancement of all its institutions and its commitment\r\nto provide education and health care for all, Jordan has\r\nmade considerable achievements in a very short time. We\r\nhave absorbed three large-scale forced migrations. My\r\ncountry offers refugees a humane social bases, granting\r\nthem equal rights to ensure their full participation in society\r\nwithout prejudice to their protected rights, in accordance\r\nwith the rule of law, international legality and their right to\r\ncompensation and repatriation. The Government allocates\r\nmore than $350 million annually from its budget for social\r\nservices to refugees. This sum represents more than four\r\ntimes the contribution of the United Nations Relief and\r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\n(UNRWA). Thus, they experience socio-economic self-\r\nreliance despite the tremendous economic problems that\r\nJordan faces, especially in terms of foreign debt.\r\nThe call for the mobilization of additional bilateral and\r\nmultilateral resources for social development and the\r\ncommitment to achieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross national product to official development assistance\r\nfalls within the declared and unrealized commitments of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit. As we approach the third millennium,\r\nwe find ourselves facing a real challenge to the\r\nachievement of sustainable socio-economic growth, not\r\ngrowth based on temporary handouts and quick fixes. We\r\nare convinced, now more than ever, that the developing\r\ncountries cannot achieve these social objectives alone. Thus,\r\nwe hope that there will be an ongoing dialogue between the\r\ninternational financial institutions and the United Nations to\r\nenhance social development through structural changes and\r\nthe creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms.\r\nWe also support the call by the World Bank to\r\nestablish a comprehensive development framework that\r\ncombines macroeconomic criteria with financial, structural\r\nand social considerations.\r\nMy delegation also calls for free access by\r\ndeveloping countries to markets, and to membership in\r\nthe World Trade Organization as soon as possible. It also\r\ncalls for enhancing international, technical and\r\nadministrative cooperation as a framework to activate\r\nefforts aimed at creating the necessary enabling\r\ninternational environment for social development and the\r\nreal pursuit of the goal of integrating the economies of\r\ndeveloping countries into the international economy. In\r\nthis way, developing countries would realize self-\r\nsufficiency and real partnership as well as social security\r\nfor all, so that mankind can live, as God Almighty\r\nintended, in dignity on Earth.\r\nMr. Chaouachi (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): As we\r\nmeet to assess the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development — a very\r\nimportant item for us — we recognize that the Summit\r\nhas led to the creation of a new concept of social\r\ndevelopment. Its recommendations were a serious point of\r\ndeparture in our quest for new and effective social\r\ndevelopment policies, and it set forth priorities that place\r\nthe human being at the centre of development.\r\nWe have considered with interest the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on the preparatory\r\nwork for the follow-up to the Copenhagen Summit. We\r\nwould like to thank him for the serious work done in\r\npreparing the report. This is a good sign for the success\r\nof the special session of the General Assembly to be held\r\nin June 2000 in Geneva.\r\nWe would also like to thank the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for its efforts in the lead-up to that session.\r\nWe also support all decisions taken in that regard. We\r\nwould like to thank the Government of Switzerland for\r\noffering to host the special session of the General\r\nAssembly and for the steps taken to that end.\r\nIn assessing the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, allow me to reaffirm the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, which\r\nthe international community has endorsed. This\r\nassessment makes it possible to evaluate progress towards\r\nremoving the obstacles to the full implementation of the\r\nSummit’s recommendations. The first commitment of the\r\nSummit was to provide an enabling national and\r\ninternational environment for social development, poverty\r\neradication and improved employment opportunities, in\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 6 October 1999\r\naddition to providing basic facilities for education, health\r\ncare and the advancement of women. We are increasingly\r\nconvinced that the growing globalization that marks the end\r\nof this century and encompasses all aspects of life has some\r\nnegative elements; and unless they are contained, the effect\r\nwould be an increasing imbalance in international relations\r\nand in development processes. Therefore, the international\r\ncommunity is called upon to firmly and resolutely meet the\r\nchallenges of globalization and to define approaches that\r\nwould create the balance required to give a human face to\r\ndevelopment, as the Secretary-General has said in many\r\nstatements and in the latest report of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme.\r\nWe would like to voice our concern here that despite\r\nthe efforts being made, official development assistance still\r\nhas not attained the goal of 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct. Thus, this duty of international solidarity, which\r\nshould govern relations among peoples, has not been met.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development made poverty\r\neradication one of its priorities. Here we reiterate the\r\nappeal made by the President of the Republic, Mr. Zine\r\nEl Abidine Ben Ali, to all leaders and international\r\ninstitutions and United Nations bodies for the establishment\r\nof a world solidarity fund that would collect contributions\r\nand donations to combat poverty and ensure development\r\nin the most disadvantaged areas, in particular in the least\r\ndeveloped countries, which suffer from many crises.\r\nTunisia is seeking to rally support for this\r\nhumanitarian project so that the international community\r\ncan be in step with the Copenhagen recommendations and\r\ncommitments. Tunisian experience in the area of social\r\ndevelopment is recounted in the national report that we\r\nsubmitted in accordance with the resolution of the\r\nPreparatory Committee that was adopted at the\r\norganizational session in May 1998. In accordance with\r\nglobal humanitarian guidelines, we have given greater\r\npriority to social development through a global\r\ndevelopment policy, backed up by the following concepts:\r\ncorrelation of economic and social dimensions in a way\r\nthat would comprehensively consolidate human rights;\r\nincreasing the role of civil society; the need to provide\r\nprotection for everyone, along with decent living\r\nconditions, equal opportunity, non-exclusion, and non-\r\nmarginalization; the need to prevent, contain, and\r\novercome social ills; the need to increase and improve\r\nsocial care and services for the poorest sectors; the need\r\nto provide support for the role of women and, hence, the\r\nrole of the family, given their importance for social\r\nstability and the development of society; and the need to\r\nstrengthen solidarity between communities and\r\ngenerations through environmental protection programmes\r\nthat would create conditions conducive to sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFinally, we hope that the special session will live up\r\nto our expectations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
