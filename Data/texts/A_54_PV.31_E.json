(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 37 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/220)\r\nReport of the Preparatory Committee for the\r\nSpecial Session of the General Assembly on the\r\nImplementation of the Outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and Further\r\nInitiatives (A/54/45 and Corr.1 and Add.1)\r\nDraft decisions I, II and III (A/54/45, para. 71 and\r\nCorr.1); and IV (A/54/45/Add.1, para. 6)\r\nMr. Reva (Ukraine): The course of development of\r\nworld society since the Copenhagen Summit has vividly\r\nproved that the significance of social development and\r\nhuman well-being for all should be recognized and given\r\nthe highest priority both now and into the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe preliminary assessment of the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the World Summit indicates one major\r\npositive development, namely the evident shift towards\r\nrecognizing social development as a political priority of the\r\ninternational community. At the same time, we all\r\nunderstand that the achievement of the goals established at\r\nCopenhagen will be a lengthy and complicated process.\r\nIn the report on the first session of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the Special Session of the General\r\nAssembly on the Implementation of the Outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and Further\r\nInitiatives, it is rightly noted that improvements in the\r\nsocial area have to be an integral part of any effective\r\nstrategy of development, both at the national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nFully sharing this view, I would like to underline\r\nthat, among other global activities in the social area, the\r\nWorld Summit became a landmark on the road of the\r\nworld community towards the advancement of\r\ninternational cooperation in the field of social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Summit reaffirmed the commonly upheld view\r\nthat social development should be an integral part of\r\ndomestic policy, and all the national economic\r\nprogrammes lay serious responsibility on Governments\r\nbefore their societies, because all such programmes have\r\nsocial consequences. In this context, my delegation would\r\nlike to point out the necessity of strict observance by all\r\nthe Member States of the World Summit decisions, which\r\nassigned concrete tasks and defined common approaches\r\ntowards ensuring further social progress and improving\r\nthe living conditions of the people of the world. Common\r\npositions outlined in Copenhagen reflect a focused view\r\non prospects for development both for individual States\r\nand for world society. The Summit decisions, despite\r\nbeing of a non-mandatory character, set out stable ethical\r\nand moral standards which are to become the goal of the\r\nsocial development of mankind in the twenty-first century.\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nAs we see from the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nthe process of implementing these goals has been\r\nprogressing at various degrees of speed and success. While\r\nassessing how far the Summit objectives have been\r\nimplemented, it seems necessary to know how much\r\nprogress has been made since March 1995. In this regard,\r\nwe need to share positive experiences, to learn lessons and\r\nto carefully study the existing difficulties in this matter.\r\nTherefore, we lay our hopes on the success of next year\u0027s\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, called to evaluate\r\nthe ability of the community of nations to respond properly\r\nand adequately to major social challenges and to fulfil our\r\ncharted commitments.\r\nBearing in mind a steady tendency towards\r\nglobalization at the international level, coupled with that of\r\nliberalization and economic reform at the national level, it\r\nis time to enhance international cooperation based on the\r\nprinciples of non-discrimination, open competitiveness,\r\npartnership and mutual benefit. The United Nations should\r\nplay the key role in establishing effective mechanisms for\r\nsuch cooperation.\r\nIn our opinion, United Nations activities in the social\r\nand economic area should focus more on the specific\r\nrequirements of countries with economies in transition in\r\norder to facilitate the process of their integration into the\r\nworld economic space. International cooperation and\r\nassistance in this regard will ensure more effective\r\nimplementation of economic reforms in these countries and\r\nhelp to overcome the unavoidable difficulties inherent in the\r\ntransition process. As a result of this process, these\r\ncountries will reach much earlier a high level of economic\r\ndevelopment which corresponds to their potential. Such a\r\nperspective will enable them, in turn, to provide assistance\r\nto developing countries. The experience of some Central\r\nand Eastern European countries that have achieved\r\nremarkable economic and social progress during the last\r\ndecade proves that this perspective is absolutely real.\r\nThe social sphere is considered a decisive factor in our\r\ncountry\u0027s economic development. The Government\u0027s\r\nstrategy in this field is embodied in the “Main social policy\r\ntrends in Ukraine for the years 1997-2000,” approved by\r\npresidential decree. The main task of this programme is to\r\nset up specific mechanisms aimed at the implementation of\r\nthe principles of a socially oriented economy and at the\r\nenhancement of social policy based on the efficient use of\r\nexisting resources. Among of the priority goals of social\r\npolicy in my country are to provide for fully productive\r\nemployment of people, to raise the quality and\r\ncompetitiveness of the labour force and to minimize the\r\nnegative social consequences of unemployment.\r\nOur State employment policy fully meets relevant\r\ninternational standards and is based on the principle of\r\nensuring equal rights and opportunities for all citizens,\r\nirrespective of their origin, socio-economic status, race,\r\nnationality, gender, age, political views or religious\r\nbeliefs. Such a national policy envisages that every citizen\r\nof Ukraine can exercise a free choice of activity\r\naccording to his or her abilities and professional skills,\r\npersonal interests and social needs.\r\nThe social insurance system of our country is also\r\nnow undergoing a reform process aimed at raising the\r\nlevel of citizens\u0027 social protection and motivation to work,\r\nas well as the personal responsibility of employers and\r\nemployees for accumulation of Ukraine\u0027s insurance funds.\r\nThe parliament of Ukraine has adopted the State concept\r\nof social security, as well as basic legislation on\r\nmandatory State social insurance. The Government of my\r\ncountry makes every effort towards successful\r\nimplementation of its national programme of action aimed\r\nat establishing a stable system of social relations in a\r\nmarket economy, promotion of social integration and\r\nsocial justice.\r\nUkraine will continue the consistent implementation\r\nof the commitments it entered into in Copenhagen and\r\nwill continue to actively participate in the preparations for\r\nthe General Assembly special session for the year 2000.\r\nWe believe that the consolidation of international efforts\r\nto solve existing social/development problems will create\r\nthe necessary conditions for further economic growth and\r\nsocial progress. It will promote further implementation of\r\nthe goals established at the World Summit to the benefit\r\nof all peoples and for the sake of creating a civilized\r\nsociety for each and everyone.\r\nMr. Gold (Israel): As we reflect on the years since\r\nthe 1995 World Summit for Social Development in\r\nCopenhagen, we find ourselves at a momentous\r\ncrossroads. Globalization and the new information age\r\npromise to bridge geographic distances, transcend borders\r\nand replace traditional sources of global wealth — based\r\non natural resources — with information technology. In\r\nthe decades to come, global wealth will be generated not\r\nby what is in the ground, but by what is in the minds of\r\nmen. This may have some unsettling consequences, but it\r\nalso opens the door to unprecedented opportunities.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nThe previous coalitions in the international\r\ncommunity — driven by petrodollars and the cold war —\r\nhave crumbled. In their place lies a new reality, in which\r\ngeography will be less important than communication\r\nchannels. Alliances can be built on joint ventures, not\r\ngeopolitical grievances; cooperation can start from shared\r\nchallenges and not common hostilities. in the new era\r\nresponsibility will lie with those nations that possess\r\nspecialized expertise and the willingness to cooperate on\r\nsocial development.\r\nThe State of Israel has accepted this mantle for 50\r\nyears. In Israel, cooperation in development has become a\r\nnational raison d\u0027être, a fulfilment of the ancient Jewish\r\ntradition of Tikkun Olam: mending the world. Less than 10\r\nyears after Israel\u0027s birth, the Israeli Foreign Ministry had\r\nalready established the Centre for International Cooperation\r\n(MASHAV). Quietly, while other problems loomed larger\r\nin the foreground, Israel built this Centre into a wide-\r\nranging network of projects, courses and programmes that\r\nhave trained some 70,000 people from more than 150\r\ncountries. These programmes work directly to meet the\r\ncommitments laid out in the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, as enumerated in draft decision\r\nA/AC.253/L.7, submitted to the Preparatory Committee by\r\nits Vice-Chairman.\r\nCommitment 1 from Copenhagen is to create an\r\nenabling environment for social development. One of\r\nMASHAV\u0027s main branches is its Cooperative Development\r\nProgramme (CDP), which aims to train professionals in\r\nnew ways of enhancing their society\u0027s economy and policy-\r\nmaking. A prominent example is China: hundreds of\r\nChinese professionals were given special training on the\r\nfunction of Israel\u0027s market economy, the role of research\r\nand development, the modernization of management\r\nsystems and the way Israel taps the creativity of its people.\r\nThey used this expertise to implement new programmes in\r\nChina itself.\r\nCommitment 2 from Copenhagen is to seek to\r\neradicate poverty. Israel views poverty eradication as a\r\nlong-term goal, and seeks to develop ways in which nations\r\ncannot only overcome poverty, but also maintain the ability\r\nto continue to keep it at bay on their own. That means\r\ndeveloping potential industry. Examples of this strategy\r\ninclude Peru, where Israel\u0027s Cooperative Development\r\nProgramme helped to revitalize the fruit export trade, and\r\nEl Salvador, where Israel worked to rehabilitate the dairy\r\nindustry, which had been all but destroyed.\r\nCommitment 3 from Copenhagen is to promote the\r\ngoal of full employment. In today\u0027s times we cannot\r\nignore the harsh price that some nations are paying for\r\nchanges in the global economy, particularly as certain\r\nsectors, such as the elderly, are forced out of long-held\r\njobs. The impact is especially severe in agricultural\r\nsocieties. In an effort to reverse this trend, Israel has\r\ninitiated some special programmes, notably in countries\r\nsuch as Georgia and Armenia. MASHAV\u0027s CDP has\r\nsought to link family farms to collectives and to\r\nindustries. This has helped preserve employment, while\r\nincreasing food security and the overall productivity of\r\nthe industries. In the case of Uzbekistan, Israel\u0027s linking\r\nof family farms to the dairy industry actually sparked a\r\nGovernment decision to establish 40 additional dairy\r\nplants.\r\nCommitment 4 from Copenhagen is to promote\r\nsocial integration. MASHAV recently initiated a number\r\nof conflict-resolution courses, in accordance with the\r\nrecommendations of draft decision A/AC.253/L.7.\r\nRecently, a workshop of Greek Cypriots and Turkish\r\nCypriots was held in southern Israel, with encouraging\r\nresults. In addition, MASHAV has pioneered programmes\r\nto integrate young people into the development process,\r\nby supporting the development of youth frameworks in\r\nvarious countries. It is worth noting that this area has\r\nbecome a focus of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation, as may\r\nPalestinians participate in MASHAV\u0027s youth leadership\r\nworkshops.\r\nCommitment 5 from Copenhagen includes the\r\npromotion of equity between men and women. In\r\naccordance with the international drive to integrate\r\nwomen into the larger society — from the workforce to\r\nthe policy-making sphere — Israel has had some major\r\nsuccesses. One of the training centres in Israel, the\r\nGolda Meir Mount Carmel International Training Centre,\r\nbrought in 7,050 participants, from countries in Asia,\r\nAfrica, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, to\r\nattend some 300 courses for women engaged specifically\r\nin community development. A noteworthy example is Ms.\r\nSalimata Kante, a social worker in Senegal, who trained\r\nin Israel and then returned to establish a successful string\r\nof savings and credit cooperatives.\r\nCommitment 6 from Copenhagen is to promote and\r\nattain universal and equitable access to high-quality\r\neducation and health services. Israel has developed\r\ncourses for training hundreds of education professionals\r\nfrom countries around the world, who have returned to\r\nmake tangible progress in their own States. An interesting\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nexample is Chile, now in the midst of a major educational\r\nreform programme in the areas of science and technology.\r\nIsrael worked to train some 200 Chilean teachers and\r\nprincipals in specialized science teaching. Similarly, in Peru\r\nthe National Committee of University Rectors has adapted\r\nIsrael\u0027s system of community educational centres for\r\ntraining in agricultural technology.\r\nCommitment 7 from Copenhagen is to accelerate the\r\ndevelopment of Africa and of the least developed countries.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Israel invests much of its cooperative\r\nefforts in sharing know-how with developing nations,\r\nespecially in Africa. Yet, beyond agriculture, Israel has also\r\nhelped to reform the health-care systems of many nations.\r\nThese efforts have included programmes covering primary\r\nhealth care, legislation for national medical care, insurance,\r\nthe use of computers in medical services, upgrading\r\nhospital and clinic facilities, mobile eye clinics and training\r\ncourses for nurses. In Ethiopia and in Namibia, for\r\nexample, Israel\u0027s eye clinics have cured literally thousands\r\nof blind people.\r\nCommitment 8 from Copenhagen is to include social\r\ndevelopment goals in structural adjustment programmes.\r\nMASHAV has made a top priority of insisting that its joint\r\nventures with partner countries include efforts to\r\ndecentralize the planning and increase participation by the\r\nvarious players in the development process. Thus,\r\nMASHAV seeks to personalize development at the\r\ncommunity level. This strategy is highlighted by\r\nMASHAV\u0027s series of post-graduate courses in integrated\r\nregional rural development.\r\nCommitment 9 from Copenhagen is to provide\r\nresources for social development. MASHAV tries to use its\r\nprogrammes as a means to generate investment in various\r\ndeveloping countries in order to spur economic and tax\r\nreform. This was the case, for example, in Ethiopia, where\r\nIsrael helped create a pilot agricultural project in Kobo,\r\ndesigned to attract investors and aid privatization. A viable\r\ntaxation system is among the primary goals of MASHAV\u0027s\r\neconomic training seminars.\r\nCommitment 10 from Copenhagen is to ensure\r\ninternational cooperation for social development. This\r\ncommitment might well be a credo of the Israeli Foreign\r\nMinistry\u0027s Center for International Cooperation. Nearly all\r\nof MASHAV\u0027s activities and programmes serve to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation for either social or sustainable\r\ndevelopment. This includes such programmes as the\r\nCooperative Development Programme; the Development\r\nStudy Centre, specializing in economic and social training\r\nfor development; the International Institute, offering\r\nleadership seminars; and a host of localized and\r\npersonalized on-the-spot programmes.\r\nIt remains our hope that these projects will not only\r\nenhance social development, but embody the central\r\nprinciple of the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nnamely, that the human being remains the prime focus of\r\nour global development aims. We have waited 50 years\r\nto break down the walls of hostility and outmoded\r\ncoalitions based on a reality that no longer exists in this\r\nHall, so that we can together deal with the pressing\r\nproblems posed by a changing global environment. I call\r\nupon Members to join us and to let the spirit of\r\ncooperation triumph over poverty, strife and resignation.\r\nMr. Seif Iddi (United Republic of Tanzania): My\r\ndelegation wishes to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the reports before us. They provide\r\na sound basis for discussions.\r\nThe statement made by the Chairman of the Group\r\nof 77 and China, with which we associate ourselves,\r\nreflects our concerns on the follow-up to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. Permit me therefore to\r\nunderscore a few points and to share with the Assembly\r\nthe experiences of my country.\r\nIn our statement last May to the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the Special Session of the General\r\nAssembly on the Implementation of the Outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and Further\r\nInitiatives, we pointed out the gap between aspirations\r\nand reality and we acknowledged the difficulties involved\r\nin bridging that gap. Now, as we stand on the threshold\r\nof the new millennium, the most challenging task is to\r\ndecide on the next course of action.\r\nSince Copenhagen, a number of developments have\r\ntaken place locally and internationally. In Tanzania, the\r\nGovernment undertook a comprehensive reform\r\nprogramme covering all the social, political and economic\r\nsectors with the objective of making them more\r\nresponsive, efficient and accountable to the people. In this\r\nconnection, a poverty-eradication strategy was developed\r\nto guide and improve the delivery of services to the\r\npeople.\r\nIn recognition of the negative impact that the\r\nphenomenon of unemployment has on society, the\r\nimplementation strategies of the Human Resource\r\nDeployment Act that was passed in 1983 were reviewed\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nand vocational education and training were set up so as to\r\nexpand vocational training, mostly for youths.\r\nIn a bid to address the volatile international financial\r\nsituation, the Government has instituted a stable, predictable\r\nand conducive macroeconomic framework. Institutional\r\nreforms have been introduced and measures to improve\r\nrevenue collection adopted. In this case, the value-added tax\r\nintroduced in 1998 accounted for improved revenue\r\ncollection. Tax administration has improved and so has\r\ndeficit financing, while strict budgetary controls have been\r\nput in place. The Investment Promotion Policy of 1990 was\r\nreviewed in 1996 and a new Investment Policy adopted that\r\nemphasizes maximum mobilization and utilization of\r\ndomestic capacity, including enhanced cooperation with\r\nother developing countries, as well as developed ones.\r\nFurthermore, the role of the private sector was redefined to\r\ngive it a more central role. Political pluralism, which has\r\nbeen in place since 1992, was re-emphasized in order to\r\nenhance democracy.\r\nIt is evident that in Tanzania, after Copenhagen, it was\r\nno longer “business as usual”. The Government\u0027s\r\ncommitment to implementing the Copenhagen Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action should be looked at in the light\r\nof the bold and decisive measures that it had taken towards\r\nthis end. However, as we stand on the threshold of the new\r\nmillennium, the reality is painfully brought home to us that,\r\nbecause we operate in the international milieu, unilateral\r\naction can be effective only up to a point, after which\r\ninternational cooperation becomes necessary.\r\nThe experiences that we have gone through have\r\ndemonstrated to us that positive national as well as\r\ninternational environments are a prerequisite in supporting\r\nefforts aimed at implementing not only the Copenhagen\r\ncommitments, but also all other commitments made at\r\nmajor international conferences of the 1990s. We need a\r\nholistic and complementary approach that will include both\r\nthe economic and the social dimensions and we need the\r\ncooperation of the international community, in particular\r\nthose who are better endowed than us. In this connection,\r\nimproved terms of trade, access to international markets,\r\nincreased direct foreign investments, alleviation of the\r\nexternal debt burden and an expanded resource base are\r\nsome of the crucial issues that have to be seriously\r\nconsidered.\r\nIn his report contained in document A/54/220, the\r\nSecretary-General points out that the review process has\r\nhighlighted the fact that several of the targets specified in\r\nthe Programme of Action will not be met within the period\r\nagreed and that in some instances there have been severe\r\nsetbacks. Significantly, we note that the fight against\r\npoverty has also been eroded by the severe economic\r\ndifficulties experienced in some countries brought about\r\nby the financial crisis and related developments.\r\nThese problems have had a ripple effect even in\r\ncountries far from the scene of crisis. This phenomenon\r\nshould help elucidate the fact that in this era of\r\nglobalization the potential to globalize poverty is as great\r\nas the potential to globalize prosperity. For humanity the\r\nonly way to go is to build on the positive while avoiding\r\ncarrying the baggage of poverty into the next century.\r\nLet us seize the moment at the special session to\r\nrededicate ourselves at the highest level to improving our\r\nrecord relative to that of the last five years. Posterity will\r\njudge us not by the number of times we fail, but by the\r\nefforts we made to overcome our failures.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): I have the honour to\r\naddress the General Assembly on agenda item 37,\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development”. At the outset, my delegation wishes\r\nto align itself with the statement made earlier by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Guyana on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. We also wish to thank the\r\nSecretariat for the documents before this Assembly. The\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report (A/54/220) imparts useful\r\ninformation on activities being undertaken by the United\r\nNations system, as well as by Member States, in\r\npreparation for next year\u0027s special session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAn assessment of the world social situation indicates\r\nthat, while progress has been made in some areas over the\r\nfour years since the Copenhagen Summit, significant gaps\r\nremain within and between countries. Divergent trends in\r\nworld economic growth and the persistence of inequalities\r\nare evident and are influenced by the process of\r\nglobalization.\r\nMany developing countries remain severely indebted,\r\nand current per capita income levels remain below those\r\nof the 1980s in much of Africa, Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean and parts of Asia. The alarming statistics on\r\nthe world\u0027s poverty levels are cause for extreme concern.\r\nIn a number of developing countries, violence, crime and\r\nillicit drugs are major symptoms of social disintegration.\r\nEconomic difficulties,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nsuch as high levels of unemployment and the resulting\r\nsocial isolation, are often reflected in antisocial behaviour.\r\nWhile improved methods of policing and narcotic\r\ntrafficking controls are important, these are not sufficient to\r\nsolve the linked problems of violent crime and illicit drugs.\r\nThere must also be emphasis on removing the underlying\r\ncauses. As the United Nations Development Programme\r\nHuman Development Report has reminded us, poverty\r\nmeans more than the lack of material well-being. It also\r\nstems from a lack of opportunities and choices basic to\r\nhuman development.\r\nMarket economies and democratic political institutions\r\nhave generally been viewed as promoting universalism\r\nthrough the removal of barriers to equality. However, in\r\nmany societies there are limitations to the operations of\r\nmeritocratic principles. Among these are unequal access to\r\nmaterial resources, differential access to earning\r\nopportunities and status factors, such as gender, race, colour\r\nand ethnicity, which reinforce social stratification.\r\nIn spite of these gaps and challenges, we cannot lose\r\nsight of the vision for the creation of a society for all,\r\ncharacterized by respect for all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, equity, social justice and equality,\r\nwhich underlies the essence of the commitments made at\r\nCopenhagen.\r\nMy delegation wishes to give special recognition to\r\nthe work done by the Commission for Social Development\r\nin the follow-up to the Copenhagen Summit. We will also\r\ncontinue to participate actively in the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for next year\u0027s special session of the General\r\nAssembly, and in this regard we look forward to receiving\r\nthe information and recommendations requested\r\ncorresponding to the Summit\u0027s 10 commitments.\r\nWe also welcome the fact that the 1999 substantive\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council conducted\r\nhigh-level discussions on the theme “The role of\r\nemployment and work in poverty eradication: the\r\nempowerment and advancement of women”. The resulting\r\nministerial communiqué recognized the central role that\r\nproductive employment plays in poverty eradication and\r\nthat the mainstreaming of a gender perspective into policies\r\naimed at poverty eradication is all the more crucial since\r\nwomen constitute the majority of people living in poverty.\r\nMy delegation intends to remain seized of the issue of\r\npoverty eradication and to ensure that it retains a central\r\nrole in the special session.\r\nJamaica\u0027s social agenda embraces the three core\r\nthemes of the Social Summit: poverty eradication,\r\nexpansion of productive employment and social\r\nintegration.\r\nThe Government of Jamaica is committed to the\r\npromotion of policies which encourage self-employment,\r\nand has designed and implemented programmes in pursuit\r\nof that goal. The Micro Industry Development Agency,\r\nwhich promotes micro industrial ventures by providing\r\nlow-interest loans, and the Human Employment and\r\nResource Training National Agency are but two examples\r\nof programmes which the Government of Jamaica has\r\nestablished to achieve the goal of full employment as a\r\nvehicle to reduce poverty. In addition, programmes are in\r\nplace to provide a basic social safety net.\r\nOn the basis of our experience in Jamaica, we\r\nbelieve that the following points, which were first made\r\nby Jamaica\u0027s Minister of Labour, Social Security and\r\nSports at the Preparatory Committee meeting in May,\r\nshould form part of our thrust if we are to achieve social\r\ndevelopment for all in a globalizing world.\r\nJamaica believes that an appropriate macroeconomic\r\npolicy mix must be maintained. Such policies must be\r\nbalanced, credible and stability-oriented with the potential\r\nto promote economic growth and employment. Job\r\ncreation must be a central feature of these policies. We\r\nbelieve that businesses should adopt a culture of social\r\nresponsibility in which they support the communities in\r\nwhich they operate.\r\nThere is an urgent need for the international\r\ncommunity to assist in cancelling or significantly reducing\r\nthe debt burden of developing countries. Here, we\r\nrecognize the steps that have been taken in regard to the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. It must\r\nalso be recognized that economic and social policies are\r\nmutually reinforcing and that social policy should\r\ntherefore be considered as a productive factor which can\r\nhave a positive impact on development.\r\nEfforts to ensure access to credit and appropriate\r\ntechnologies for small-scale enterprises must be critical\r\npolicy objectives in stimulating economic growth and\r\nreducing poverty. In responding to the challenges of the\r\nglobal market, it must be recognized that human resource\r\ndevelopment is one of the most crucial elements, as the\r\nperformance of other resources, including capital, land\r\nand technology, are directly linked to the performance of\r\nlabour.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nWe believe that much greater emphasis must be placed\r\non relevant education and training for a more productive\r\nwork force. Policy interventions to link training\r\nprogrammes to meet the demands of the economy and to\r\nadequately prepare young job-seekers for the labour market\r\nare critical. In addition to conventional education and\r\ntraining programmes, new and creative strategies must be\r\nintroduced to address the needs of the poor and other\r\ngroups with limited access to the formal education system.\r\nAlso, rural/urban differences in manifestations of poverty\r\nmust be clearly understood and addressed accordingly.\r\nIn closing, I wish to reaffirm the commitment of the\r\nJamaican Government to the principles and goals embodied\r\nin the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action,\r\nwhich reflect our collective desire for a better world for all\r\nour people.\r\nMrs. Al-Nadari (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Yemen would like to express\r\nits support for the statement made by the representative of\r\nGuyana on behalf of the Group of 77 and China on the\r\nitem 37 under discussion.\r\nWe are committed to the obligations and directives of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development. Allow us to\r\nmention the following steps we have accordingly taken\r\nwithin the framework of the first five-year plan: first,\r\nrestoring economic growth as the basis for social\r\ndevelopment, through implementing structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes in order to strike a balance at the\r\nmacroeconomic level and to promote market economies;\r\nsecondly, developing social services through increasing the\r\nshare of public and private sector spending on those\r\nservices; thirdly, combating poverty and increasing job\r\nopportunities; fourthly, consolidating the principles of\r\ndemocracy as the basis for development; and fifthly,\r\npromoting female participation in economic activities and\r\ngiving women a chance to participate directly in decision-\r\nmaking.\r\nThe objectives of our five-year plan are in keeping\r\nwith the Copenhagen Declaration\u0027s call for the creation of\r\nan economic, social, political, health and educational\r\nenvironment enabling the peoples of the world to achieve\r\ncomprehensive social development and to address the root\r\ncauses of poverty. In the light of those objectives we have\r\ntried to do the following at the national level.\r\nFirst, an imbalance between our resources and\r\npopulation growth, as well as structural problems in the\r\nnational economy, have led to increased poverty. The\r\naverage wages in the period 1991-1996 were reduced by\r\n17 per cent, unemployment increased and subsidies were\r\nlifted, which meant that the poor had to shoulder very\r\nheavy burdens. Thus, the living conditions deteriorated. In\r\nreality, population growth in Yemen is among the highest\r\nin the world, 3.7 per cent annually. Therefore, combating\r\npoverty has become a major priority challenge that we\r\nhave to face.\r\nSecondly, as regards education, we have achieved\r\nsome degree of progress over the past three decades.\r\nHowever, it is far from being enough. Therefore our\r\nGovernment has taken several steps. Basic education for\r\nall by the year 2015 is one goal, and a second is basic\r\neducation for children from ages 6 to 15 in order to\r\nincrease the percentage from 65 per cent in 1994 to 90\r\nper cent in the year 2006. We intend to reduce illiteracy\r\nrates among women from 76 per cent in 1994 to less than\r\n40 per cent by the year 2006, and to reduce the gap\r\nbetween rural and urban areas.\r\nAs far as the health sector is concerned, we are\r\ntrying to spend more money on health policies and health\r\nservices, as well as encouraging the participation of the\r\nprivate sector. In order to live up to our commitments in\r\nthe area of health services, we have adopted the following\r\nmeasures: reducing contagious and parasitic diseases,\r\nimproving the nutritional situation, protecting women and\r\nchildren from health hazards, improving health care,\r\nattempting to reduce death rates and increase the average\r\nage to 60 years by the year 2000, and reducing infant\r\nmortality from 138 per thousand to 75 per thousand.\r\nIn the area of housing, we have adopted policies\r\nwhich take into account the population increase and\r\nfinding solutions to this problem through the provision of\r\nsoft loans to individuals and groups.\r\nSince 1995 we have taken the measures in the field\r\nof social security aimed at reducing the burden on the\r\npoor, providing job opportunities for the unemployed,\r\nincreasing popular participation and bolstering social\r\ninterdependence. We have also adopted a number of\r\nprogrammes in order to reduce the effects of contractive\r\neconomic policies and to create job opportunities for the\r\npoor and the unemployed. We have provided training\r\nfacilities for the handicapped, and we have undertaken a\r\nnumber of projects.\r\nIn the field of social integration and social\r\ndevelopment in Yemen, we have been trying to achieve\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nthis goal on the basis of the importance of human\r\nresources. This is very important in terms of development.\r\nYouth and childhood are another concern. Promoting\r\nthe care of children is one of the major policies adopted in\r\nYemen. We provide protection for children and enable them\r\nto benefit from education facilities. Regarding youth, the\r\nState has adopted an ambitious policy to ensure their\r\nparticipation in the labour market by providing training\r\nfacilities and national institutions designed for this purpose.\r\nRegarding women, equality between the sexes is a\r\nvery important objective for my country. In order to\r\nimprove the situation of women and achieve equality, the\r\nState has promulgated laws and legislation to enable women\r\nto participate, making it possible for women to receive\r\neducation and to work. In 1994, 20.2 per cent of the total\r\nlabour force was composed of women. Women also\r\nparticipate in the political life of the country.\r\nYemen is among the least-developed countries and\r\nfaces serious economic difficulties that have led to\r\nstructural imbalances. This has meant that the rate of\r\neconomic growth is low, and therefore success in abiding\r\nby the commitments of Copenhagen can be achieved only\r\nthrough cooperation among States, local authorities and\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nAt the international level, we need to establish a\r\nframework for cooperation and assistance because of their\r\nextreme importance for the implementation of the outcome\r\nof the World Summit.\r\nFinally, we hope that the international community will\r\nincrease its efforts to ensure a successful outcome of the\r\nSummit.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision taken\r\nby the Assembly at its 28th plenary meeting, on 6 October,\r\nI now call on the Observer of Switzerland.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French): Since\r\nthis is the first time that I am addressing this year\u0027s\r\nAssembly, allow me first of all to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your election to the presidency and to\r\nextend to you my best wishes for success in carrying out\r\nthis important function.\r\nLess than nine months from now, the General\r\nAssembly will be meeting at the Palais des Nations in\r\nGeneva for the special session on the follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development.\r\nSwitzerland is proud to host the General Assembly\r\nin Geneva. The Swiss federal, cantonal and communal\r\nauthorities would like to take advantage of this\r\nopportunity to express their gratitude to the United\r\nNations Secretariat in New York and in Geneva, the\r\nChairman of the Preparatory Committee and the various\r\nspecialized agencies for their outstanding cooperation and\r\nthe enthusiasm they have been demonstrating in preparing\r\nthis important event.\r\nDuring its informal meeting at the end of August the\r\nSwiss delegation informed the Preparatory Committee and\r\nits Bureau of the state of progress of preparations.\r\nWhat I wish to emphasize today are the objectives\r\nof our special session. They are clear and far-ranging.\r\nWe need to reach agreement regarding innovative\r\napproaches and solutions to forge the economic and social\r\nframework of tomorrow\u0027s world. The Swiss delegation is\r\nencouraged and welcomes the spirit of cooperation\r\ndisplayed by the participants at the last informal session.\r\nThis atmosphere made it possible to reach agreement in\r\ntime on such issues as the participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and their accreditation. These\r\nissues are important from an organizational point of view\r\nfor the General Assembly and also for the host country.\r\nIn addition, substantial progress has been made in\r\ndrawing up the text to be submitted to the special session.\r\nThese recent developments augur well for the follow-up\r\nto our work.\r\nWe are gratified to be receiving significant\r\ncontributions which the specialized agencies entrusted to\r\ndo between now and the end of the year.\r\nThe impact of the special session will depend both\r\non its content and on the level of participation, which\r\nshould therefore be as high as possible. The preparations\r\nfor the follow-up are well advanced, and therefore we\r\nhope that Governments will be represented in Geneva at\r\nthe highest possible level. Governmental participation,\r\nhowever, is not sufficient. The need to find and\r\nimplement innovative solutions requires synergetic\r\ninteraction between Governments, international\r\norganizations, the private sector and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nIn close cooperation with the United Nations\r\nSecretariat, the Swiss Government will be organizing a\r\nforum which will act as a general round table for\r\ndiscussion by bringing together non-governmental\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\norganizations, the private sector, trade unions, academics\r\nand those involved in research, as well as governmental\r\nrepresentatives.\r\nThis forum is designed to strengthen public interest\r\nand to create the new impetus which is required for the\r\nimplementation of the results of the follow-up process. We\r\ntherefore call upon Governments to participate in the forum,\r\nand we also encourage participation at the highest level of\r\nnon-governmental organizations and of the private sector.\r\nAllow me to conclude by conveying to you, Sir, how\r\npleased the Swiss authorities are that you will be opening\r\nand presiding at the end of next June of the special session\r\nof the General Assembly in Geneva.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker on this\r\nitem of the agenda.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\ndecisions I, II and III, contained in paragraph 71 of\r\ndocument A/54/45 and corrigendum 1, as well as draft\r\ndecision IV, contained in paragraph 6 of document\r\nA/54/45/Add.1.\r\nWe turn first to draft decision I, entitled\r\n“Arrangements for the special session”. May I take it that\r\nthe Assembly decides to adopt draft decision I?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe President: We turn next to draft decision II,\r\nentitled “Title of the special session”. May I take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft decision II?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe President: We turn now to draft decision III,\r\nentitled “Provisional agenda for the second session of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the Special Session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the Implementation of the Outcome\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development and Further\r\nInitiatives (3-14 April 2000)”. May I take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft decision III?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe President: We turn next to draft decision IV,\r\nentitled “Arrangements regarding participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development and Further\r\nInitiatives”. May I take it that the Assembly decides to\r\nadopt draft decision IV?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that\r\na draft resolution on this item will be submitted to the\r\nSecretariat at a later date.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 37.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother elections\r\n(a) Election of twenty members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/54/400)\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly decision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the\r\nAssembly elects the members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination upon their nomination by\r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/54/400,\r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee that\r\nwill occur as a result of the expiration on 31 December\r\n1999 of the terms of office of Argentina, Austria, Brazil,\r\nCameroon, Congo, Germany, Indonesia, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Italy, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan,\r\nPoland, Portugal, Romania, Thailand, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe. Those States are\r\neligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1\r\nJanuary 2000, the following States will still be members\r\nof the Committee: the Bahamas, Benin, China, Comoros,\r\nEgypt, France, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the\r\nRussian Federation, Uganda, the United States of\r\nAmerica, Uruguay and Zambia. Accordingly, those 14\r\nStates are not eligible in this election.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the\r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic\r\nand Social Council. There are four African States for four\r\nvacancies: Cameroon, Gabon, Mauritania and Zimbabwe.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nThere are four Asian States for four vacancies: Bangladesh,\r\nIndonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan. There\r\nare three Eastern European States for three vacancies:\r\nPoland, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. There are\r\nfour Latin American and Caribbean States for four\r\nvacancies: Argentina, Brazil, Cuba and Peru. There are five\r\nWestern European and other States for five vacancies:\r\nGermany, Italy, Portugal, San Marino and the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nall elections should be held by secret ballot. However, in\r\naccordance with paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, the\r\nAssembly may, in elections to subsidiary organs, dispense\r\nwith secret balloting when the number of candidates\r\ncorresponds to the number of seats to be filled.\r\nThe number of States nominated from among the\r\nAfrican States, the Asian States, the Eastern European\r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean States and the\r\nWestern European and other States is equal to or does not\r\nexceed the number of seats to be filled in each of those\r\nregions.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes to\r\ndeclare those States nominated by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil from among the African States, the Asian States,\r\nthe Eastern European States, the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States and the Western European and other\r\nStates — namely, Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil,\r\nCameroon, Cuba, Gabon, Germany, Indonesia, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Italy, Mauritania, Pakistan, Peru, Poland,\r\nPortugal, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Ukraine,\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\r\nand Zimbabwe — elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination for a three-year term\r\nbeginning on 1 January 2000?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that have\r\nbeen elected members of the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 168\r\nGranting of observer status in the General Assembly\r\nfor the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.8)\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the representative\r\nof Greece to introduce draft resolution A/54/L.8.\r\nMr. Rokanas (Greece): It is an honour and a\r\npleasure for me to briefly take the floor in order to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/54/L.8 on the granting of\r\nobserver status in the General Assembly for the Black Sea\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization. Greece has\r\nsubmitted this draft resolution, under item 168 of the\r\nagenda, in its capacity as holder of the presidency of the\r\norganization, a post that rotates on a six-monthly basis.\r\nThe Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) came\r\ninto existence in 1992 as an intergovernmental mechanism\r\naimed at establishing a network of economic cooperation\r\namong its 11 founding member States, namely Albania,\r\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece,\r\nMoldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Turkey and\r\nUkraine.\r\nBSEC functioned effectively, in its initial form as an\r\nintergovernmental forum, until 1 May 1999, when it was\r\ntransformed into a regional international organization\r\nunder the name “Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization”. According to its Charter, adopted at the\r\nsummit meeting in Yalta on 4 and 5 June 1998, the\r\nBSEC institutional structure consists of, inter alia, a\r\nCouncil of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, a Chairman-in-\r\nOffice, a Troika, a Committee of Senior Officials, a\r\npermanent international secretariat, and a number of\r\nworking groups on a variety of topics such as economies,\r\nfinance, science and technology, communications, tourism\r\nand the environment.\r\nIn addition, since its inception, BSEC has been\r\ngradually extending its scope by developing a grid of\r\ninternational relations. Nine States have already acquired\r\nobserver status: Austria, France, Germany, Egypt, Israel,\r\nItaly, Poland, Slovakia and Tunisia. Many others have\r\napplied for such status, and their requests are currently\r\nunder consideration. Observer status has also been\r\nexchanged with the Energy Charter Conference.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nFurthermore, BSEC has been productively cooperating\r\nwith various international organizations such as the\r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe, as well as within the framework\r\nof the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe.\r\nThe principles and objectives enshrined in BSEC\u0027s\r\nCharter are broadly supportive of, and in complete harmony\r\nwith, those embodied in the United Nations Charter. Since\r\nits very first steps, BSEC has energetically pursued\r\nfriendship, good- neighbourliness, mutual respect,\r\nconfidence, dialogue and cooperation in a wide variety of\r\nfields ranging from development, economies and finance,\r\nhealth care, and science and technology to the fight against\r\nterrorism and organized crime, including the illicit\r\ntrafficking of drugs. BSEC has, in effect, consistently used\r\neconomic means with a view to promoting also politically\r\nsignificant goals and, in particular, peace, security and\r\nstability in the entire Black Sea region.\r\nTwo years ago, in Yalta, the heads of State or\r\nGovernment of BSEC decided to seek observer status in the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly in the conviction that this\r\nwould substantially benefit both organizations and enable\r\nthem to promote and enhance their economic and social\r\nefforts, contribute to the establishment of a common\r\napproach and joint policies, and avoid unnecessary\r\ncontradictions and duplication.\r\nFurthermore, obtaining observer status would greatly\r\nassist BSEC itself not only in consolidating the positive\r\nresults already achieved so far, but also in continuing, with\r\nrenewed vigour, its endeavours in pursuance of its noble\r\ngoals and principles.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like, on behalf of the\r\nmember States of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization, to extend our heartfelt thanks to the numerous\r\ndelegations that sponsored this draft resolution. I should\r\nlike also to mention some others that have joined the list of\r\nsponsors: Denmark, Estonia, Fiji, India, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Slovenia and Uruguay. Our heartfelt\r\nthanks go also to those delegations.\r\nI would be grateful if all the delegations present here\r\nwould kindly lend their support to this draft so that it could\r\nbe adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Gorita (Romania) (spoke in French): I should\r\nlike at the outset to express the Romanian Government\u0027s\r\nsatisfaction at the inclusion on the agenda of this session\r\nthe item regarding the granting of observer status in the\r\nGeneral Assembly to the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (BSECO). The granting of such\r\nstatus would represent additional support for the States\r\nmembers of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization in their efforts for regional integration as\r\nwell as in the broader global integration process.\r\nThe June 1992 Declaration establishing the\r\nOrganization demonstrates the will of the participating\r\nStates to develop among themselves broad economic\r\ncooperation, to work together to transform the Black Sea\r\nregion into a zone of peace, stability and prosperity and\r\nto promote friendly and good-neighbourly relations.\r\nFor Romania, participating in this cooperative\r\nstructure enables us to accelerate our economic and social\r\ndevelopment and our process of integration into the\r\nEuropean Union. As a founding country, Romania\r\nactively supported the idea of transforming the Black Sea\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization into a regional\r\neconomic organization with its own identity and a unified\r\nposition in its relations with other international\r\norganizations. Hence, prestigious international\r\norganizations such as the European Union, the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the\r\nCouncil of Europe, the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe, the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization, the European Bank for\r\nReconstruction and Development and the European\r\nInvestment Bank have expressed an interest in granting\r\nobserver status to the BSECO or are already supporting\r\nthe activities of the organization.\r\nCooperation with the BSECO is being strengthened\r\nby the initiation, in June 1999, of the activities of the\r\nBlack Sea Trade and Development Bank, whose\r\nheadquarters are in Thessaloniki, and which will be\r\nproviding financial support for cooperation projects in the\r\nregion. Likewise, the memorandum of cooperation\r\nbetween the BSECO and the European Union, adopted on\r\n30 April 1999, attests to the interest that the organization\r\nattaches to relations with the European Union. In this\r\ncontext, particular importance is accorded to the European\r\nUnion\u0027s decision to provide assistance, through its\r\nregional programmes, to countries members of the\r\norganization so as to carry out the projects initiated within\r\nthe organization as well as to participate on a permanent\r\nbasis in BSECO meetings.\r\nStarting on 1 November 1999 and for the duration of\r\nits chairmanship of the BSECO in 2000 — and in the\r\ncontext of its membership, with Greece and the Republic\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nof Moldova, in the troika of the organization — Romania\r\nintends to identify specific ways of cooperating with other\r\nneighbouring cooperative organizations, including the\r\nCentral European Initiative, the Mediterranean Initiative, the\r\nBaltic Council, the Commonwealth of Independent States\r\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope.\r\nThe step that we are taking today is being given\r\nconcrete expression in draft resolution A/54/L.8. Initiated\r\nby Greece on behalf of the Chairman of the organization\r\nand supported by Romania and all the members of the\r\norganization, that draft resolution would grant observer\r\nstatus to the BSECO in the General Assembly and\r\nrepresents an important step in affirming the role of the\r\nBSECO on the political and economic stage at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): The delegation of Armenia\r\nis pleased to join the sponsors of draft resolution A/54/L.8,\r\non the granting of observer status in the General Assembly\r\nfor the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization,\r\nwhich was introduced today by the delegation of Greece.\r\nThroughout its centuries-long history, the Black Sea\r\nbasin has been a region with many problems and an area\r\nwhere the interests of different countries have intersected.\r\nMeanwhile, the tendency towards strengthening cooperation\r\nin the region is becoming more and more dominant. The\r\nestablishment of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization is a remarkable manifestation of this positive\r\ntendency. At the current stage, the States members of the\r\nBSECO differ both in the level of their economic\r\ndevelopment and in their approach towards the regulation\r\nof the economic process. They also have different views on\r\nregional problems, the solution of which will require a\r\ndetermined stance and resolute political will on the part of\r\nthe leaders of the States of the region. It was the desire to\r\ncreate a real basis for regional economic integration that\r\ndrove 11 countries of the Black Sea region to found an\r\norganization which will lead their societies towards a\r\ncommon understanding of the indivisibility of their political\r\ndestiny.\r\nThe objectives of the BSECO remain clear and\r\nunderstandable: to develop an equal partnership, to strive\r\nfor a better life for the peoples of the region and to achieve\r\nthe prosperity of all Black Sea countries in the interest of\r\npeace and stability. Regional economic cooperation, which\r\naims to transform the different national economies through\r\ndialogue, mutual respect, confidence and conciliation, will\r\nsignificantly contribute to success in the complex process\r\nof transition to a market economy and will ultimately lead\r\nto the consolidation of a beneficial partnership in all\r\nfields of common interest.\r\nSince independence, Armenia has been expressing its\r\nfirm commitment to developing regional cooperation, and\r\nwe are a founding member of and an active participant in\r\nthe Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization.\r\nArmenia has always considered the BSECO to be a\r\npromising model for fostering interaction and harmony\r\namong the participating States, and we believe that it will\r\nundoubtedly contribute to the creation of a Europe-wide\r\neconomic space in the future and promote understanding\r\nand security in the region.\r\nArmenia believes that efficient and effective\r\ncooperation among the Black Sea countries will help\r\nconsolidate the strategic economic potential inherent in\r\nthis area, promote free trade, open roads and other means\r\nof communication and foster the welfare of peoples, thus\r\nstimulating the peaceful settlement of existing political\r\ndisputes and reinforcing the independence, sovereignty\r\nand democratic development of the BSECO member\r\nStates. We attach great importance to the financial pillar\r\nof the BSECO, the Black Sea Trade and Development\r\nBank, which has recently started operations. The Bank is\r\nto become the principal mechanism of the BSECO in\r\nworking out, financing and implementing joint regional\r\nprojects and providing financial resources for the\r\nparticipating States.\r\nMuch has been done in the seven years since the\r\nBSECO was founded, although there are still certain\r\ndifficulties. These may be accounted for by the fact that\r\nthe majority of countries in the organization are going\r\nthrough a period of reform and transition to a market\r\neconomy and are searching for an economic model for\r\ntheir development and role in regional processes.\r\nAccordingly, they need to search for new, adequate ways\r\nand means of strengthening the BSECO process. Putting\r\nthe main emphasis on discovering additional reserves in\r\nthe BSECO region itself, the member States must use the\r\nsignificant resources that are at the disposal of other\r\ninternational organizations and regional structures. A\r\nnumber of them, including the Council of Baltic Sea\r\nStates, the Central European Initiative, the South-East\r\nEuropean Cooperative Initiative and the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization, are interested in collaborating\r\nwith the BSECO in areas of common interest. The\r\ntendency of a number of countries to pay greater attention\r\nto the activities of the BSECO and to apply either for\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nobserver status or full membership in the organization is\r\nalso worth noting.\r\nGuided by the principle of BSECO openness towards\r\nthe global economic environment, member States are\r\nfurther developing activities aimed at promoting fruitful\r\nworking relations with other international organizations and\r\ninstitutions whose own experience could be beneficial to the\r\nneeds of the BSECO countries. Contacts between the\r\nBSECO and other regional and international organizations\r\ninclude exchanges of information and documentation,\r\nworking visits and participation in each other\u0027s events. It\r\nwas the principle of openness towards the outside world\r\nwhich motivated the member States when, two years ago in\r\nYalta, they took the important decision to apply for\r\nobserver status for the BSECO in the General Assembly of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nGood traditions of partnership already exist with the\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe (ECE) and with the\r\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\n(UNIDO). The ECE has provided support in the\r\norganization of joint workshops for BSEC countries on\r\nspecific subjects regarding multilateral economic\r\ncooperation, while UNIDO is engaged in projects in the\r\nfield of environmental protection.\r\nArmenia believes that observer status in the General\r\nAssembly would facilitate the fulfilment of BSEC\u0027s\r\nmission and significantly increase the organization\u0027s\r\nweight in the international arena. I would like to conclude\r\nby expressing the hope that the General Assembly will\r\ngive its unanimous support to the draft resolution before\r\nus.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/54/L.8. May I take it that\r\nthe General Assembly decides to adopt that draft\r\nresolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.8 was adopted\r\n(resolution 54/5).\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 168?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.\r\n13\r\n"
