(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/54/1)\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe reason for the early adjournment of yesterday’s\r\nmeeting would seem to be a symbolic call to reality.\r\nI wish to express my appreciation for the convening of\r\nthis meeting and for the opportunity offered us by the\r\nSecretary-General through the presentation of his report and\r\nhis statement at the opening of the general debate. As seen\r\nwithout exception in the preceding statements, all of us\r\nshare the urgency of holding an in-depth discussion and of\r\nguiding the United Nations in this era of neo-\r\ninterventionism under humanitarian pretexts.\r\nThere is no country with a greater will for change than\r\nCuba, nor with a greater vocation and boldness, for\r\nconfronting old and new problems, the solutions to which\r\nseem ever farther away for humankind rather than closer.\r\nNo people could embody a better example of optimism and\r\nconfidence in the future than our people. This is not a\r\nquestion of meeting the challenges of globalization and\r\nmodernity with stereotypes from the past. No country has\r\nchanged more since 1959 or sought to change this\r\nunsustainable and unjust world order with more courage\r\nand dedication than Cuba. But we believe it is necessary to\r\ndo so with straightforward political realism, without\r\navoiding painful truths.\r\nDoes anyone in this Hall believe that they might\r\nread on the Internet or in a newspaper in the foreseeable\r\nfuture that a South-East Asian country has requested or\r\nreceived a mandate from the Security Council to\r\nintervene, without the consent of the White House, in a\r\ncivil conflict in Michigan that the White House has been\r\nunable to control, a conflict resulting from wild actions of\r\nthe famous local militias?\r\nAre we discussing how a coalition of African\r\ncountries might intervene under the United Nations\r\nCharter in some European country, against the will of a\r\nfar-right Government that, in a context of growing\r\nxenophobic feelings, is oppressing immigrants or its own\r\nminorities?\r\nIs the goal of this debate perhaps to determine how\r\nthe United Nations could intervene in the world’s largest\r\ndrug market and drug-use centre?\r\nOr is it to discuss how to prevent someone with a\r\nnuclear briefcase and thousands of nuclear warheads from\r\nlaunching, in an act of irresponsible arrogance or fleeting\r\nmadness, a number of missiles, conventional or\r\notherwise?\r\nI wish that the unjust, unsustainable and tyrannical\r\nworld order endured by the countries of the South could\r\nbe redesigned by a working group or changed by a\r\ndecision of the General Assembly. As a matter of fact, we\r\nin this Hall know quite enough about unfulfilled\r\nagreements, empty promises and thwarted hopes.\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nThe Secretary-General has asked critical questions and\r\nhas hit a raw nerve. It is now the responsibility of the\r\nMember States to give him a clear and prompt mandate to\r\nprevent dark and powerful hegemonic interests from\r\ncontinuing to gain ground in the real world while we are\r\nbusy writing documents. We run the risk of being\r\nconfronted with faits accomplis.\r\nThe developing countries’ dilemma is whether or not,\r\nin the future, under certain circumstances and procedures,\r\nto continue to allow themselves to be subject to intervention\r\nby a handful of Powers that monopolize the necessary\r\neconomic and military capability, which is the result of\r\nrealities that are not determined in this Hall.\r\nCuba wishes to state that there will never be any\r\nintervention in Cuba, under any pretext or circumstances\r\nwhatsoever, because that is the sovereign will of its people.\r\nOur people have already faced one risk of nuclear\r\nintervention, as Che Guevara explained in this Hall, 35\r\nyears ago, and now face daily attempts at intervention by\r\nthe super-Power 90 miles off our coast.\r\nThis interpretation and exercise of sovereignty will not\r\nallow itself to be mutilated, and it is what we wish for all.\r\nWe understand the reality of a globalized world and\r\nwill work hard towards the globalization of justice,\r\ndevelopment and solidarity. But under conditions of a\r\nunipolar and neo-liberal world order; under the economic\r\nand military dictatorship of a super-Power; and given the\r\nimposition of a single model, the nuclear club, the offensive\r\nmilitary doctrine of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,\r\nthe so-called global threats, countries being relegated to the\r\n“Euro-Atlantic periphery”, the financial blackmail against\r\nthe United Nations, the tyranny of some permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council and the Council’s double\r\nstandards; the crippling of the General Assembly; and the\r\nways that political selectivity and manipulation applied to\r\nhuman rights issues — in view of all this, it would be\r\nsuicidal to endorse the right to global intervention that has\r\nalready been exercised in Kosovo.\r\nWe are not calling on the international community or\r\nthe United Nations to remain impassive and inactive in the\r\nface of genocide and other crimes. On the contrary, we are\r\nyet again demanding from this rostrum that the United\r\nNations take resolute and urgent action to find just and\r\nlasting solutions to the ever-increasing number of conflicts.\r\nThe General Assembly must take urgent action and must\r\nexpressly and directly mandate the Secretary-General to\r\ntake immediate steps.\r\nHistory eloquently shows that peace cannot be\r\nimposed by force or by war, and that military operations\r\ndo not lead to lasting solutions. Unless we improve the\r\nliving conditions of the four fifths of humanity who suffer\r\nfrom underdevelopment and poverty; unless we are able\r\nto rescue 1.3 billion from extreme poverty; unless we can\r\nprevent the deaths of the 8 million children who die every\r\nyear before they reach their first birthday and of the 19\r\nmillion children under the age of five who die every year\r\nfrom curable diseases and malnutrition; unless we can\r\nfeed the 900 million hungry people; unless we can cure\r\nthe 23 million AIDS-infected Africans; unless we can\r\nteach the 1 billion illiterate human beings to read and\r\nwrite — unless we do all this, conflicts will continue.\r\nUnless we stop the irresponsible printing of dollars\r\nand the financial speculation that in just a few hours\r\nwipes out the reserves built up by countries over long\r\nyears of sacrifice; unless the industrial countries’ financial\r\ninstitutions become as transparent as ours are required to\r\nbe; unless the International Monetary Fund stops\r\nimposing inhumane structural adjustment programmes;\r\nunless the United Nations and its development\r\ninfrastructure are saved from assault and subjugation by\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions; unless a new socially\r\noriented financial architecture is created; unless the\r\nmarket’s blind madness is curbed; unless transnationals\r\nare prevented from gaining increasing control over our\r\neconomies; unless the weakening and shrinking of\r\nGovernments is halted; unless the first world’s\r\ncommitment to provide 0.7 per cent of its gross national\r\nproduct for official development assistance is fulfilled;\r\nunless the imposition at all costs of liberalizing policies\r\nthat are not even followed by the first world is stopped;\r\nand unless the opulent societies’ irrational consumption at\r\nthe expense of our poverty is curbed — conflicts will\r\ncontinue.\r\nConflicts will continue as long as the North\r\ncontinues to impose an imperfect and environmentally and\r\neconomically unsustainable political model that may,\r\nperhaps, work in the North — a model reached after\r\ncenturies of absolute monarchies, without free or just\r\nelections, without universal suffrage, without women\r\nhaving the vote, without eight-hour work days, without\r\nwhat today is called “good governance”, though this\r\nconcept has yet to be defined or agreed on by anybody.\r\nWe refuse to sanctify a model in which there is little\r\nparticipation, much abstention, little popular credibility\r\nand widespread commercialization of politics. Unless the\r\nimposition of cultures and artificial borders by colonial\r\nPowers is recognized as an essential historical factor in\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nmany current conflicts and unless the right to independence\r\nand self-determination is accepted and the diversity of\r\ncultures and models comprehended, conflicts will continue.\r\nIf there is a continued expectation of the disintegration\r\nof States and unless it is firmly accepted that existing\r\nborders are inviolable, conflicts will continue. If the\r\npolitical manipulation of human rights continues — the\r\nselectivity, partiality and double standards; if economic and\r\nsocial rights are ignored; if the right to development is\r\ndisregarded; if a sectarian and abstract international human\r\nrights law is imposed; and if all human rights are not\r\nguaranteed for all human beings — conflicts will continue.\r\nIn order to act, the United Nations needs urgently to\r\ndemocratize itself. The General Assembly must resolutely\r\nexercise its powers, even in the field of conflicts.\r\nAccording to the Charter, the United Nations means of\r\nacting in cases of conflicts do not end with the broad\r\npowers of the Security Council but rather with the General\r\nAssembly, where there is no room for the politics of global\r\nor regional hegemony, where there is no obsolete veto\r\nright, where everyone has a voice and a vote.\r\nThe Security Council must be expanded and provide\r\nequitable representation for developing countries. The veto\r\nmust disappear, or at least for now be restricted to Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter. The observance of double standards\r\nmust stop. The Council’s excesses must be averted and its\r\nshortcomings redressed. It is imperative to support the\r\nCouncil’s legitimate authority and to prevent this authority\r\nfrom being violated, ignored and manipulated.\r\nThe pre-eminence, absolute validity and inviolability\r\nof the Charter must be restored through deeds. The Charter\r\nis not just another source of law but the cornerstone of the\r\nUnited Nations and of what remains of the precarious\r\ninternational legal regime. It is the foundation of the\r\ncollective-security system devised by humankind to prevent,\r\navoid and resolve conflicts.\r\nWe do not accept the idea of “diplomacy backed up\r\nby force” or the idea of “diplomacy based on the use of\r\nforce”, attempts to impose diplomacy by firepower. In our\r\nopinion, so-called humanitarian interventions, as tried out\r\nin Kosovo, are simply violations of the Charter and of\r\ninternational law. The United Nations Charter very clearly\r\ndefines the conditions in which the United Nations may\r\nundertake acts of force for the sake of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. Cuba categorically rejects\r\nany act of force that is not in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the Charter. There can be no justification\r\nwhatsoever for such acts.\r\nTo disguise interference and interventionism by\r\ndescribing them as “humanitarian” not only is\r\nunacceptable, it also distorts the legal framework that we\r\nhave adopted at the United Nations with regard to\r\ngenuine humanitarian assistance. It is self-evident that the\r\nconcept of so-called humanitarian intervention is not\r\nenshrined in any of the Charter’s provisions. Therefore,\r\nwe wonder if it is contained in some proposed\r\namendment to the Charter. If this is the case, the\r\nOrganization has a set procedure that must be observed.\r\nThis procedure which includes, among other basic\r\nrequirements, discussion and decision-making with the\r\nparticipation of all Member States.\r\nSome people’s well-known tactic of trying to\r\nsurreptitiously impose concepts foreign to the Charter by\r\ntaking advantage, in their own interests, of any small\r\nloopholes they find in the United Nations mechanisms for\r\npolicy planning and implementation cannot be accepted in\r\nthis Organization.\r\nWe agree with many of our colleagues on the\r\nimportance of creating a culture of prevention at the\r\nUnited Nations. Now, the first step must be the reaching\r\nof a mutual understanding between us all on the scope of\r\nand the practical implications and methods to be applied\r\nin creating such a culture.\r\nIt would also be unquestionably appropriate to create\r\nadequate early-warning instruments against the emergence\r\nof phenomena that might evolve into conflicts, but it\r\nwould be unacceptable that they be established through\r\nmechanisms available almost exclusively to the\r\nindustrialized countries for obtaining information on the\r\nrest of the world at their own convenience. For some\r\nyears now, proposals have been submitted to us that, in\r\nactuality, could only be prelude to the most obvious and\r\nblatant interference.\r\nPreventive diplomacy is much touted, but in practice\r\nwe are not told what exactly is being sought by it. We\r\nwonder what the difference is between this concept and\r\nthe mediation or good offices that are historically and by\r\ndefinition carried out by the Secretaries-General of this\r\nOrganization. The fact that the name is now being\r\nchanged tells us the extent to which the concepts have\r\nalso been substantively changed. I think this Assembly\r\ndeserves to know what those changes are.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nLittle is said about the principle of consent, and too\r\nmuch about the imposition of peace, without taking into\r\naccount the fact that, in a world where justice and equity\r\nprevail, peace is not to be imposed, but rather to be attained\r\nthrough development, equal opportunities for every citizen,\r\nthe absence of corruption and the guarantee of genuine\r\nparticipation by the people in designing its own destiny.\r\nIn conclusion, there is no excuse whatsoever for\r\nviolating the principles of international law and the United\r\nNations Charter. Such principles constitute the developing\r\ncountries\u0027 only guarantee of being able to defend their\r\nindependence by legal means. Only the Security Council\r\nhas the power under the Charter to impose measures that\r\nentail the use of force. The use of force in any other\r\ncircumstance is illegal and illegitimate. The United Nations\r\nCharter also provides mechanisms that allow the General\r\nAssembly to adopt decisions and actions even when the\r\nSecurity Council is unable to act. Every nation has the right\r\nto develop its own models of political order and economic\r\nand social development. Any imposition of foreign models\r\nis illegitimate. The use of double standards is not\r\npermissible.\r\nCuba asserts its support for the United Nations and its\r\noverall reform. In the context of this unshakable\r\nunderstanding, Cuba supports courageous, honourable,\r\nlegitimate and prompt measures. We will never exploit\r\nthese measures to justify the use and abuse of power and\r\nforce by a few hegemonic Powers or to destroy our\r\nsovereignty and the principles that guarantee it. We will use\r\nthem, rather, to resolve the deep-rooted causes of such\r\nactions, such as the dramatic phenomena behind the sort of\r\nhuman tragedies that have occurred in certain regions of\r\nour tormented world. History shall not forgive our inaction\r\nor our slowness.\r\nMs. Ramiro-Lopez (Philippines): I wish to thank the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his statement and\r\nfor his report contained in document A/54/1, which provide\r\nus with a comprehensive overview of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. The report reflects the increasingly\r\nmultifaceted tasks which we Member States have entrusted\r\nto the Organization and provides us with thought-provoking\r\nideas which deserve in-depth consideration and\r\nexamination.\r\nThe world, in continuous transition, challenges the\r\nUnited Nations today. Without negating the benefits that\r\nchanges and shifts in international politics have brought our\r\ngeneration, the international community remains\r\npreoccupied with the unending crusade to achieve peace\r\nand development, to protect human rights, to promote the\r\nrule of law and to fight injustice and crime. Now more\r\nthan ever, as the millennium creeps slowly upon us, the\r\nUnited Nations is staring at the challenge to achieve\r\nunprecedented creativity in order to reaffirm the principles\r\nof its founding Charter.\r\nBut the United Nations needs to critically assess its\r\nperformance and even rethink many of its established\r\nways of conducting its business to pursue the Charter\r\nprinciples. There can be no substitute, at this time or in\r\nthe near future, to the central role of the United Nations\r\nfor meeting the many demands of a world in transition.\r\nIts Member States should make a determined effort to\r\nhelp evolve a modern, efficient and reformed world body\r\nto carry out the multidimensional responsibilities it is\r\nassigned by the international community.\r\nThe first and foremost of these responsibilities is the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. At the\r\nend of the century, the United Nations is once more\r\nemerging as a major player, as is evident through the\r\nmany requests for its intervention in many crisis\r\nsituations. The Security Council is the primary organ\r\ntasked to carry out such responsibilities, but, as has been\r\npreviously noted, its elitist structure and decision-making\r\nprocess — which has been and could still continue to be\r\nvulnerable to vetoes — cast doubts on the ability of the\r\nSecurity Council to represent the international community\r\nand not just the influential members of the Security\r\nCouncil. This consideration makes it more urgent for the\r\nUnited Nations to seriously reform the working methods\r\nof the Council and enable it to respond more rapidly to\r\ncrisis situations.\r\nOne of the most important issues addressed in the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report is the concept of humanitarian\r\nintervention and its impact on traditional concepts of\r\nsovereignty in the light of the many crises and complex\r\nhumanitarian situations confronting our world today.\r\nToday, the nature of conflicts has changed; their effects\r\nand their causes are more complex and far-reaching.\r\nWhat seems to be envisioned now is a more\r\nintrusive role for the United Nations, one that is not\r\nlimited to facilitating a compromise political settlement\r\namong contending parties, but that includes the resolution\r\nof certain underlying causes of conflicts, the setting-up of\r\nconditions for political participation, such as elections, the\r\ntraining of civil servants and the police, and the\r\nstrengthening of democratic institutions, among others. In\r\nmore serious cases, the United Nations may even assume\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\npart of the governmental administration. Because of their\r\ninherent orientation towards the deep-seated structural\r\ncauses of conflicts and violence and to the fundamental\r\nreforms and more permanent solutions to these conflicts,\r\npreventive diplomacy and peace-building interventions\r\nwould tend to involve the United Nations far more deeply\r\nthan before in the internal affairs of States. Needless to say,\r\nthese eventualities have been a cause of concern to many\r\ncountries. The controversy is likely to persist as the\r\nmeaning of national and state sovereignty in the present\r\nundergoes unpredictable permutations.\r\nMy delegation\u0027s views on this issue were clearly\r\narticulated in the statement of my Foreign Secretary,\r\ndelivered at the 21st meeting, on 1 October, in the general\r\ndebate of the present session. He said:\r\n“State sovereignty is important; it will always be.\r\nSo is individual sovereignty. That the redefinition of\r\none should coincide with the renewed consciousness\r\nof the other is, to my delegation, not an accident.\r\nThese developments need not even be seen as parallel,\r\nas if they do not meet; for in truth, they converge.\r\n“But we agree with the Secretary-General that\r\nthe more important question is how the United\r\nNations — the only truly universal, if imperfect, arm\r\nof the international community — is to respond to the\r\npolitical, human rights and humanitarian crises\r\naffecting so much of the world. We have to be more\r\ninnovative in our approaches to problems relating to\r\nmassive and systematic human rights violations. We\r\nagree that empowering the United Nations enough to\r\nmatch its Charter mandates in today\u0027s and tomorrow\u0027s\r\nworld requires that we, the Member States, update our\r\nconcept of national interest.”\r\nOn the question of the United Nations, regional\r\norganizations and security, we agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that it is necessary and desirable to provide support\r\nfor regional and subregional arrangements and initiatives on\r\nmatters of international peace and security. The United\r\nNations, lacking the capacity, resources and expertise to\r\naddress all issues unique to each region of the world,\r\nshould complement rather than supplant regional peace\r\nefforts.\r\nThe humanitarian challenges referred to in the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report are one of the central concerns\r\nof my Government. Providing assistance to the victims of\r\nconflict is a moral imperative and must be pursued as a\r\ncomplement to measures aimed at conflict resolution. While\r\nhumanitarian assistance is an immediate response, it is at\r\nthe same time a necessary step towards full recovery,\r\nrehabilitation and development. Humanitarian aid should\r\nnot only be devoid of any semblance of politics, but must\r\nalso, as much as possible, lay the initial but firm\r\nfoundation for post-conflict growth. It should at the same\r\ntime fully respect the sovereignty of recipient countries;\r\nthey must be consulted and their full consent must be\r\nsecured.\r\nWe are happy to note that the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs has exerted its best\r\nefforts to ensure coordinated inter-agency responses to\r\nvarious humanitarian emergencies. Timely humanitarian\r\naction is required to minimize further loss of lives and\r\ndeterioration in living conditions. It is therefore critical\r\nthat relief assistance be mobilized immediately and\r\ndispatched to places requiring urgent attention. In this\r\nregard, it is very important that needs assessment be\r\nundertaken without unnecessary delay so that prospective\r\ndonors are provided with information to enable them to\r\nreact quickly to the appeal.\r\nAttacks on humanitarian personnel continue to pose\r\nmajor problems in humanitarian assistance. In this regard,\r\nall efforts must be exerted by countries, particularly the\r\nhost countries, to ensure the safety of all personnel\r\ninvolved in humanitarian assistance.\r\nHumanitarian emergencies often are complex\r\nsituations, requiring the involvement of those willing and\r\nin a position to provide help. Inter-agency cooperation\r\nand coordination, particularly at sites where humanitarian\r\nassistance is required, must ensure the involvement of\r\nother international and local actors, such as non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, community organizations,\r\nreligious groups and other private-sector groups.\r\nVery early on we realized that legal instruments of\r\na general nature would not be sufficient to address the\r\nissue of human rights. The Organization lost no time in\r\nfilling this gap. Today, we have legal human rights\r\ninstruments that cover virtually all areas. But more needs\r\nto be done.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General emphasizes a\r\ntragic fact: human rights are flouted wantonly across the\r\nglobe, and genocide, mass killings, arbitrary and summary\r\nexecution, torture, disappearances, enslavement,\r\ndiscrimination, widespread debilitating poverty and the\r\npersecution of minorities still have to be stamped out.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nNot only do we need to conclude normative\r\ninstruments for all other areas of human rights, but we also\r\nhave to strengthen the implementation and compliance\r\nregimes of existing ones. A step in this direction is the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court. Many\r\ndifficult issues involving sensitive matters faced the\r\nnegotiators, but to their credit, and with the help of the\r\nSecretary-General, many of these issues were resolved. We\r\nare now in the process of drafting implementing rules.\r\nThese difficulties are now less a problem, and I am\r\nconfident that the Preparatory Commission drafting these\r\nrules will be successful in its task.\r\nThe Philippines welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in reforming the Organization through improved\r\nefficiency and a human resources management strategy that\r\npromotes managerial excellence and accountability. We\r\nappreciate the contributions made by the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services, in its five years of existence, in\r\nincreasing management accountability within the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Philippines notes the intention of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to place savings derived from efficiency measures\r\nin the development account and make them available for\r\nadditional projects. While we supported the establishment\r\nof the development account, we stressed that the transfer of\r\nresources associated with productivity gains to the\r\ndevelopment account should not be a budget reduction\r\nexercise, should not result in involuntary separation of staff\r\nand should not affect the full implementation of all\r\nmandated programmes and activities. We regret that\r\ndiscussions on the modalities for the operation and\r\nsustainability of the development account have not been\r\nconcluded. We hope that this can be concluded soon.\r\nThe Philippines notes with serious concern, in\r\nparagraph 294 of the report, the continuing critical financial\r\nsituation of the United Nations, which hampers the ability\r\nof the Organization to implement the mandated programmes\r\nand activities in an efficient and effective manner. We\r\nheard the other day from the Under-Secretary-General for\r\nManagement on the grim prospects for reimbursing\r\ncountries that provide troops and equipment to various\r\npeacekeeping operations, many of which are developing\r\ncountries, unless a significant arrearage payment is received\r\nfrom Member States, notably from a major contributor. We\r\nbelieve that the only viable solution to the persistent\r\nfinancial crisis of the United Nations is for all Members, in\r\nparticular the major contributor, to settle their arrears\r\nwithout further delay and to pay their future assessments in\r\nfull, on time and without conditions.\r\nMr. Wouters (Belgium) (spoke in French): I would\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for drawing up and\r\npresenting on 20 September the report we are considering\r\ntoday in the General Assembly. The decision to introduce\r\nthe report in a plenary meeting at the outset of the general\r\ndebate is a positive innovation allowing for a tighter\r\nfocusing of the ministerial debate. The document is of\r\nunquestionable interest. The description of the\r\nOrganization\u0027s activities allow us to better place the role\r\nand the action of our Organization in the light of the\r\nmajor transformations taking place throughout the world.\r\nIn addition, the report provides an opportunity for the\r\nSecretary-General to identify the major events and\r\nchallenges of the year and to add oral interpretations or\r\nconclusions, as he has done by raising the issue of\r\nhumanitarian intervention. Several speakers have referred\r\nto this, and earlier we heard a procedural proposal\r\npresented by the Permanent Representative of Egypt.\r\nThe most important message of the report, in our\r\nview, is the conclusion that the forces of globalization and\r\ninternational cooperation continue to require in-depth\r\nadaptation of the Organization, as well as great readiness\r\non the part of the Secretary-General to restore to the\r\nOrganization the central role in international life it\r\ndeserves.\r\nWhen the Secretary-General declares:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“I have made it my highest duty to restore the\r\nUnited Nations to its rightful role in the pursuit of\r\npeace and security, and to bring it closer to the\r\npeoples it serves” (A/54/PV.4).\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nmy delegation fully supports him in this regard and in his\r\nefforts designed to transform the United Nations into a\r\nmore simple, integrated and more highly focused\r\norganization capable of carrying out its mission in its\r\nvarious areas of activities with a maximum of synergy\r\nand efficiency.\r\nThe remarks of the Secretary-General deserve our\r\nsupport all the more because they come within the context\r\nof an overall restructuring initiative aimed at adapting the\r\nentire Organization to the demands of the modern world.\r\nThat process requires the firm commitment of all Member\r\nStates and a collective, rapid and unequivocal response.\r\nThe Secretary-General clearly indicates the areas and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nespecially the crises in which the responses of the\r\ninternational community have been flawed, fragmented or\r\ncharacterized by a narrow view of the interests at stake. A\r\nbetter idea of the general interest and a better adherence to\r\nthe Charter values will enable us to see more clearly the\r\nglobal role of the Organization in the prevention of\r\nconflicts and put us in a better position to develop the\r\nessential links between political tasks and the development\r\nwork of the United Nations and to ensure progress in\r\nrespect for human rights and international law, as a key\r\nelement of our Organization.\r\nFive other aspects of the report should be emphasized.\r\nFirst, we have, sadly, witnessed the dire consequences of\r\nnatural disasters which have hit the Caribbean, Turkey,\r\nGreece, Taiwan, the Bahamas, India, Bangladesh, China\r\nand so many other countries in various regions. We share\r\nthe grief and mourn the victims, and we will continue to\r\nshow our solidarity in a concrete way. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral was right to draw our attention to the need to\r\nfurther develop and better equip early warning systems,\r\nthus allowing us to better respond to these situations.\r\nSecondly, as the Secretary-General has noted, the new\r\nglobal environment requires more systematic cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and all other actors engaged in\r\npromoting political and economic security at all levels,\r\nwhether regional organizations or even non-State\r\nprotagonists. In this connection, we welcome the progress\r\nmade in the dialogue between the United Nations and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, encouraged by the Economic\r\nand Social Council.\r\nThirdly, the Secretary-General also emphasizes the\r\nextreme seriousness of the United Nations financial\r\nsituation. The financial health of the Organization has not\r\nimproved over the last 12 months. Belgium believes that\r\nthose States which are in arrears are doing considerable\r\nharm to the international community as a whole. The\r\ndamage exceeds the loss of income caused by the\r\naccumulated debts, because our Organization is prevented\r\nfrom fully carrying out its mandate. This situation is\r\ndangerously complicating the reform exercise now under\r\nway. No penalty or sanction could redress the harm caused\r\nto international cooperation and social progress.\r\nFourthly, reform of the Security Council is also\r\nrequired by the comprehensive reform of this Organization.\r\nThis delicate matter must be judged on its merits. It is\r\nnecessary to avoid both unproductive confrontation and the\r\nindefinite postponement of this fundamental aspect of\r\nreform.\r\nFifthly, promoting durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa is an important theme of the\r\nreport. Many speakers in the general debate pleaded for\r\na more active and more generous policy by our\r\nOrganization towards the African continent, so sorely\r\ntried and tested. My country fully supports this appeal,\r\nand will play its role in the collective effort.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General deals with a host\r\nof other issues which I have not enlarged on. I merely\r\nwished to emphasize those which seemed to me to be\r\ncrucial. That in no way diminishes the importance of\r\nother aspects of the report. The report itself provides a\r\nframe of reference which is most useful for the action of\r\nthe United Nations and for the work of this session of our\r\nAssembly.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General and\r\nexpress the hope that he will follow the same procedure\r\nnext year for the presentation of the report.\r\nMr. Dahlgren (Sweden): The Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nintroduction to his report on the work of the Organization\r\ndeals with the humanitarian challenge. And his remarks\r\nhere at the opening of the general debate focused on the\r\nprospects for human security and intervention in the next\r\ncentury.\r\nFrom the outset, I want to pay tribute, on behalf of\r\nthe Government of Sweden, to the way in which\r\nSecretary-General Annan has addressed these vital issues.\r\nBecause they are vital to us in the General Assembly, as\r\nwell as for the members of the Security Council, and for\r\nour entire Organization. They are vital for the\r\nGovernments that we represent. And, above all, they are\r\nvital for all individuals, around the world, whose security\r\n— and even survival — is threatened by humanitarian\r\ncatastrophes.\r\nWe have seen many examples of such catastrophes\r\nin this past year. One was the violence in East Timor, by\r\nforces that refused to accept the rules of democracy,\r\nwhich led to extensive destruction in a Territory that\r\nshould have been allowed to start its road to\r\nindependence in peace. Another example was the “ethnic\r\ncleansing” in Kosovo, which forced close to a million\r\npeople to leave their homes, their villages, and often their\r\nown family members. There is another horrific example,\r\nwhich I will never forget: the children in Sierra Leone,\r\nthousands of them mutilated by the rebels, abducted from\r\ntheir parents, forced to use drugs, used as child soldiers,\r\nand suffering from the worst mistreatment.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nThe United Nations was founded to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. The security of each\r\nMember State was then at the centre of attention. And the\r\nCharter established a system for collective security. Never\r\nagain, it was said, would a State be attacked by another\r\nState without the rest of the world coming to its rescue.\r\nBut security is not only a matter for States. Security\r\nis also a need for individuals. Far too many people on this\r\nplanet are subject to persecution and oppression and live\r\nunder circumstances that threaten their lives. As fellow\r\nhuman beings, we cannot ignore this, even if it occurs\r\nacross a border, in another State. The important principle of\r\nnational sovereignty cannot be used as a curtain behind\r\nwhich gross violations of human rights are carried out with\r\nimpunity.\r\nIt is the view of my Government that the security of\r\nthe individual must be regarded as being as important as\r\nthe security of States. These two objectives are intertwined.\r\nThe long-term security of a State depends upon the security\r\nand well-being of its inhabitants. And much too often, in\r\nthe past, the security of the State has been used as an\r\nexcuse or pretext for actions that undermined the security\r\nof its people.\r\nThe Secretary-General spoke eloquently in this Hall on\r\n20 September about the collective conscience of humanity\r\n— a conscience that abhors cruelty, renounces injustice and\r\nseeks peace for all peoples, as he said. To us, that\r\nconscience also implies an obligation for the international\r\ncommunity to take action in situations where the security of\r\npeople is imperilled.\r\nThe United Nations is the obvious forum for dealing\r\nwith such situations. Therefore, much more must be done\r\nto make the United Nations able to rise to that challenge,\r\nfirst of all in the field of preventing conflicts. My Foreign\r\nMinister announced in the general debate that her\r\nGovernment had adopted an action programme that we\r\nhope can help to change the focus, from crisis management\r\nto early preventive action. And let us not forget that the\r\nUnited Nations already has at its disposal several\r\ninstruments for preventive diplomacy, which should be used\r\nmore frequently.\r\nFirst of all, there is a need to address the root causes\r\nof conflict. This includes eradicating poverty, achieving\r\nsustainable development and promoting human rights and\r\ngood governance worldwide. There is also a need to\r\nstrengthen the capacity to bring relief to victims of natural\r\ndisasters and of armed conflict, and to do more to prevent\r\nemergencies from arising.\r\nIt is perhaps easy to agree on that. But the more\r\ndifficult question is how the international community\r\nshould treat violent disputes if they occur entirely within\r\na country. How do we deal with the dilemma of wanting\r\nto respect each nation\u0027s sovereignty while seeking to\r\nimprove human security everywhere? Or, more precisely,\r\nshould the fact that a humanitarian catastrophe occurs\r\nwithin the borders of a State automatically hinder the\r\nOrganization from taking action? We think not.\r\nAs the Permanent Representative of Singapore said\r\nin this debate on Wednesday, in practice, sovereignty has\r\nnever been absolute. First of all, an internal dispute may\r\nvery well constitute a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity and therefore warrant action by the Security\r\nCouncil under Chapter VII. That is why my Government\r\nthought it would have been appropriate, this past spring,\r\nto have a Security Council decision to halt the actions of\r\nPresident Milosevic in Kosovo, and we regret that that\r\nwas not possible.\r\nThere may also be other instances when the United\r\nNations needs to take action, including enforcement\r\nmeasures, to stop a humanitarian catastrophe. This will\r\nalways require a case-by-case judgement, but the\r\ndecisions should be taken within a framework on which\r\nwe have all agreed. The challenge before us is to define\r\nthat common ground, to find the basis on which we will\r\nbe able to take action when human security is threatened,\r\nin accordance with the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter. The Commission on Global Governance a few\r\nyears ago presented one interesting proposal on how\r\nintervention could be authorized in cases that constitute a\r\nviolation of the security of people so gross and so\r\nextreme that it requires an international response.\r\nWhatever result we achieve in this process, one key\r\nfact must be borne in mind — the primary responsibility\r\nof the Security Council for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We are all aware of the\r\nrecent examples of how the Council has been paralysed\r\nand then by-passed by individual States or groups of\r\nStates taking action instead. I would therefore like to\r\nconclude with a word of support for the ongoing efforts\r\nto restore the authority of the Security Council and to\r\nstrengthen its legitimacy. My Government believes that an\r\nenlarged Security Council, that better reflects the realities\r\nof today\u0027s world, would also better serve the interests and\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nthe security of all peoples. The time has come for turning\r\nthis widely shared belief into concrete action.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): May I begin by\r\nexpressing my gratitude to the Secretary-General for the\r\nquality of his report on the work of the Organization, a\r\nreport which is both concise and complete. Once again, as\r\nhe has always done, the Secretary-General has sketched out\r\nfor us an unvarnished picture of the situation of a world\r\nseeking peace, development and international cooperation\r\nbut increasingly prey to new threats spawned by various\r\nconflicts. In the report, the Secretary-General takes up in a\r\nmost timely manner the vision of the Organization and\r\nreviews the challenges and what is at stake in a world\r\ndominated by globalization.\r\nWe are on the threshold of a new millennium. More\r\nthan ever before we need to guide our efforts for the advent\r\nof an era of peace and stability and act together to create a\r\nclimate conducive to understanding among nations and\r\npeoples.\r\nIt is in this context that my delegation supports the\r\nproposal of the Secretary-General to submit a special report\r\nto the Millennium Assembly which will contain a set of\r\nrealistic recommendations which will allow our\r\nOrganization to carry out its mission of human solidarity\r\nfor the coming years.\r\nIn speaking of the solidarity of mankind, the\r\nSecretary-General devoted particular attention to the\r\nhumanitarian challenge to emphasize in a highly relevant\r\nfashion the need to finalize prevention strategies to allow us\r\nto act more effectively before emergency situations arise.\r\nWe need to increasingly hone our ability to prevent crises\r\nand tragedies and to renounce our tendency to wait and\r\nthen respond to tragic situations, in fact catastrophic ones.\r\nFaced with certain humanitarian emergency situations\r\nand natural disasters, it is then up to all of us to care for\r\nthe needs of the victims of these wars and disasters by\r\nacting diligently, effectively and without discrimination.\r\nWhat is at stake here is the credibility of the system and\r\nalso the solidarity of the international community.\r\nMay I here appeal that we all transcend this difficult\r\nand sensitive debate on the right of interference, a source\r\nof division within our Assembly because of the dilemma it\r\nraises between the urgency of reacting quickly and\r\neffectively in cases of conflict or of mass violations of\r\nhuman rights and another prerogative of all States, the right\r\nto protect their national sovereignty.\r\nWe have the understanding and the capability to\r\nbenefit from this debate by establishing among us a\r\ngenuine culture of communication which must be based\r\non an exchange of views in a climate of real confidence.\r\nUltimately, we must give thought together, we must act\r\ntogether to define the appropriate criteria which will allow\r\nus tomorrow to respond collectively and effectively to\r\nhumanitarian emergency situations.\r\nWe need also to work together to strengthen the role\r\nof the United Nations and, in particular, of the Security\r\nCouncil, by making the functioning of the Council more\r\ncredible, more representative and more democratic.\r\nIndeed, only the United Nations can define and advance\r\na universalist agenda, one which can make it possible to\r\novercome the current problems and divergences.\r\nRegarding the maintenance of peace, my country,\r\nSenegal, would like once again to reaffirm its faith in the\r\nimportant role played by the United Nations in this area\r\nand to reiterate its firm commitment to providing its\r\nsupport, insofar as possible, to the proper conduct of\r\npeacekeeping operations throughout the world.\r\nWe share the ideas expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the importance and the priority which should\r\nbe given to preventive diplomacy through the use of the\r\nwhole arsenal of political and diplomatic instruments and\r\nthe peaceful means available to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe should like to recall here the oft-repeated wish\r\nof the States of Africa, a continent that pays a heavy\r\nprice because of conflict situations, to receive increased\r\nassistance for the Organization of African Unity Peace\r\nFund, aimed at strengthening African capacities in conflict\r\nmanagement and settlement.\r\nWe would also like here to thank the Governments\r\nof France, the United States and the United Kingdom for\r\nthe assistance they are rendering to African countries to\r\nenable them to intervene quickly and effectively in\r\npeacekeeping and emergency humanitarian assistance\r\noperations.\r\nFinally, we believe that strengthened interaction\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\r\nparticularly in Africa, can contribute to reducing the risk\r\nof the outbreak of conflicts. It is in this spirit that my\r\ndelegation subscribes to the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral regarding the need to pursue the strengthening of\r\nthe concept of post-conflict peace-building to ensure the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nrecovery of societies and States destroyed by wars. Within\r\nthe framework of the chapter on peace-building, my\r\ndelegation would also like to stress the need to integrate the\r\nconcept of the culture of peace into any approach to post-\r\nconflict national reconstruction.\r\nThe Secretary-General devoted a significant part of his\r\nreport to the elimination of poverty, which has become a\r\npriority objective for the institutions of the United Nations\r\nsystem. In this connection, we welcome the efforts made to\r\nassist developing countries to achieve the objectives of\r\nsustainable development. We therefore need to redouble our\r\nefforts, especially in order to stimulate investments and\r\ngrowth to deal with debt-related issues and the\r\nmarginalization of developing countries in an economy\r\ndriven by the phenomenon of globalization. Globalization,\r\ndespite its potential opportunities, for the most part has\r\nuntil now only shown us a vista of unfulfilled promises and\r\nnot very credible prospects for growth and development in\r\nthe countries of the third world. This is therefore a bold\r\nchallenge that we must meet if we wish to build a new\r\nworld order that is more just and equitable and to contribute\r\nto eliminating the causes of conflict and instability\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to highlight the\r\nirreplaceable role of the United Nations in the political,\r\neconomic and social life of our contemporary society. May\r\nthe deliberations on the report of the Secretary-General\r\nallow us to benefit from lessons and experiences on all\r\nsides, and may it assist us in spelling out the stakes and\r\npriorities for the next century in the maintenance of peace,\r\neconomic and social progress and the advancement of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I wish to thank and commend\r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the\r\nwork of the Organization. We also commend him for\r\nraising an important, topical but sensitive issue for our\r\nconsideration — namely, the issue of humanitarian\r\nintervention — which must be squarely addressed by the\r\nMember States.\r\nThe central theme of the Secretary-General’s report —\r\nfacing the humanitarian challenge — is particularly relevant\r\nin the context of our times, which are characterized by\r\nmany natural and man-made disasters and tragedies in\r\nmany parts of the world. In the wake of these crises, there\r\nis a strongly felt need for the United Nations to concentrate\r\non response-preparedness, capacity-building and bridging\r\nthe gap between emergency relief and early recovery.\r\nClearly, building a culture of prevention is much more\r\nbeneficial, long-lasting and less costly than reacting to\r\ndisasters only after they have struck.\r\nIn responding to these crises situations, there is a\r\nneed for increased and effective cooperation and\r\ncoordination among the various United Nations and other\r\ninternational agencies, which should continue to receive\r\nour strong support in all aspects of their work. At the\r\nsame time, in responding to these humanitarian challenges\r\nit is important that there should be equality and non-\r\nselectivity of treatment. Those affected, whether in Africa\r\nor elsewhere, should receive humanitarian assistance in a\r\ntimely and impartial manner.\r\nThe Secretary-General raised the pertinent question\r\nof humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction\r\nof the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in\r\nRwanda and its horrific consequences, and the forced\r\nintervention in Kosovo, which saved thousands of lives\r\nand reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there,\r\nbut which was carried out outside the ambit of the\r\nSecurity Council. It is right for the Secretary-General to\r\nraise the issue, for, clearly, the international community\r\ncannot sit idly by in the face of such massive\r\nhumanitarian tragedies. Our innate sense of morality,\r\nsharpened by the spin-offs of the technological age —\r\nsuch as the electronic media, which has made the world\r\na veritable global village — prompts us to act. Indeed, the\r\nissue is particularly pertinent in the context of our attempt\r\nto define, or redefine, the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe new century and the new millennium.\r\nAt the core of the issue raised by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is the effectiveness of the Organization in\r\nresponding to crisis situations, including grave\r\nhumanitarian tragedies unfolding before our very eyes, or\r\nwhether it should respond at all. But as he himself has\r\npointed out, there are many other types of responses that\r\nmay be just as effective as, if not more effective than,\r\nforceful intervention — which, if at all contemplated,\r\nmust clearly be a measure of last resort. In addressing the\r\nissue, the Secretary-General interpreted the Charter in a\r\ncreative way, on the argument that the Charter is a living\r\ndocument whose high principles are as relevant now as\r\nthey were before. He is, of course, right. But it is equally\r\ntrue that much of the problem lies embedded in that same\r\nCharter — namely, the decision-making processes of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly that of the Security\r\nCouncil, which must find a way of circumscribing the\r\nfrequently impasse-creating and consensus-blocking effect\r\nof the veto, which clearly was at the heart of the paralysis\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nof the Organization in connection with Rwanda, Kosovo\r\nand many other situations.\r\nThe dilemma posed by the Secretary-General in\r\nrespect of the humanitarian intervention issue should spur\r\nus to find an early consensus on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, a process that has gone on for six years too long.\r\nUntil and unless that reform takes place, the United Nations\r\nwill hobble along into the new century — 83 days away\r\nfrom where we stand now — carrying with it the\r\nundiscarded baggage of the last century.\r\nThe Secretary-General has also posed a number of\r\nother related questions that are germane to the discussion of\r\nthe subject of humanitarian intervention, but he clearly left\r\nthem to be further discussed and deliberated, as they must\r\nbe, by Member States, as it should be, which must forge a\r\nconsensus on what is clearly an extremely complex subject\r\ninvolving sensitive issues of State sovereignty, which has\r\nlong been held as sacrosanct, and individual sovereignty,\r\nwhich is assuming increasing currency but which forms an\r\nimportant and integral, though perhaps implicit, part of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. However, whatever the merits of\r\nthe argument in support of humanitarian intervention, we\r\nshould not lose sight of the necessity of securing the\r\nauthorization of the Security Council for any use of force\r\nagainst States. At the same time, the principle of\r\nintervention, if approved, should be applicable across the\r\nboard — that is, for both developing and developed\r\ncountries — on the principle that what is good for the\r\ngoose should also be good for the gander.\r\nWhile the reactions have been swift and strong on\r\nboth sides of the divide, there are no easy answers. The\r\ncompelling arguments marshalled in support of each point\r\nof view appear sound and persuasive and cannot be simply\r\ndismissed. Clearly, this is not an issue that can be settled in\r\nthe lifetime of this session of the General Assembly; nor,\r\nperhaps, in the space of a few future sessions of the\r\nAssembly. It is one that requires serious and in-depth\r\ndeliberations in an appropriate manner, such as that\r\nproposed by the delegation of Egypt. Such a thorough\r\ndiscussion is imperative, as the issue affects in a\r\nfundamental way all Members of the Organization. Member\r\nStates have benefited from the preliminary reactions of\r\nthose who have addressed this issue. We are convinced that\r\nmany others will wish to pronounce themselves on the\r\nsubject at the appropriate time and forum.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nPeacekeeping continues to be a very dynamic and\r\ndemanding task. Two major missions ended recently, but\r\ntwo new ones have been established, with prospects of\r\nadditional operations being launched in the near future.\r\nWhile there has been close cooperation and collaboration\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and subregional\r\norganizations, these regional efforts should neither\r\nsupplant the role of United Nations peacekeeping nor\r\nabsolve the United Nations, specifically the Security\r\nCouncil, from fulfilling its primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nPeacekeeping can no longer be viewed as a distinct\r\nand isolated event. It should be treated instead as an\r\nimportant element of a continuous response to\r\nincreasingly complex contemporary conflicts, ranging\r\nfrom preventive diplomacy to post-conflict peace-building.\r\nThe scope of peacekeeping has increasingly become\r\nmultidisciplinary in nature. We believe that a\r\nmultidisciplinary approach will address not only the\r\nsymptoms of the conflicts but, more importantly, their\r\nunderlying causes, which are often socio-economic in\r\nnature.\r\nComprehensive sanctions remain a powerful\r\ninstrument for the coercion of States, which unfortunately\r\noften result in dire consequences for the ordinary people.\r\nFor instance, a grave humanitarian situation exists in Iraq\r\nfollowing seven years of the most punitive sanctions ever\r\nimposed on a people. The international community and\r\nthe United Nations, in particular the Security Council,\r\nhave the heavy responsibility of alleviating the sufferings\r\nof the Iraqi people, even while grappling with the\r\nimportant issue of peace and security in that region as\r\nwell as with the other important but unresolved issues of\r\nthe Gulf war. Sanctions should be resorted to with\r\nextreme care and only when absolutely necessary, when\r\nall other peaceful measures provided for in the Charter\r\nhave been applied. They should have specific objectives,\r\nbe clearly targeted and have specified time-frames, and\r\nthey should be completely and formally lifted as soon as\r\nthey are no longer necessary, as should have been done\r\nin the case of Libya.\r\nMy delegation fully concurs with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations disarmament machinery\r\nhas not been fully utilized during the year. Indeed, the\r\nnew millennium does not look promising on the\r\ndisarmament front. We will, regrettably, bequeath to our\r\ngrandchildren a future burdened with the most awesome\r\nweapons of mass destruction created by man: nuclear\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nweapons. A number of recent events may well presage a\r\nresumption of the nuclear arms race.\r\nThree years after the historic Advisory Opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on the legality of the threat or\r\nuse of nuclear weapons, there has not been any movement\r\nto pursue in good faith and conclude negotiations leading\r\nto nuclear disarmament. With the exception of China, the\r\nnuclear-weapon States continue to block serious\r\nnegotiations on nuclear disarmament leading to the final\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. There are now new\r\nplayers in the deadly game of nuclear armament, with all of\r\nits implications for regional and global security.\r\nThe Conference on Disarmament continues to be\r\nstymied by fundamental differences among its members.\r\nThe Conference continues to shy away from constituting a\r\nworking group on nuclear disarmament. Consensus seems\r\nto be as elusive as ever. My delegation, among others, had\r\ncalled for the automatic renewal of the Conference\u0027s\r\nprogramme of work without its having to seek a fresh\r\nmandate each year. Unless this working method is changed,\r\nmuch of the work of the Conference will be stalled.\r\nAnother regrettable development in the area of\r\ndisarmament was the failure to convene the fourth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament\r\n(SSOD IV). The conference would have generated an\r\nimpetus and set important future directions and goals for\r\ndisarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament.\r\nThere is increasing cooperation and collaboration\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations in\r\nthe prevention of conflict and in peacekeeping. This is\r\nparticularly true in Africa. This is a welcome development\r\nand ought to be encouraged. However, while regional\r\norganizations, as they should, have a role in this area, this\r\ndoes not absolve the Council from its central and primary\r\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIn sharing the burdens of peacekeeping with regional\r\norganizations, the Council should not subcontract or lease\r\nout its Charter-mandated responsibility.\r\nThere is probably no single tool of conflict so\r\nwidespread, so easily available and so difficult to restrict as\r\nsmall arms. Noting that the easy availability of small arms\r\nhas in many cases contributed to violence and political\r\ninstability in many countries, the Secretary-General has\r\nobserved that the worldwide spread of such weapons has\r\ndamaged development prospects and imperiled human\r\nsecurity in every way. This is recognized by the Security\r\nCouncil, which recently discussed the issue of small arms,\r\nresulting in the issuance of an important and\r\ncomprehensive presidential statement. The convening of\r\nan international conference on the illicit arms trade —\r\nwhich, we hope, will be chaired by a developing country,\r\ngiven the fact that the problem largely affects the\r\ndeveloping world — will be a major contribution in\r\naddressing this issue.\r\nMy delegation condemns in the strongest terms the\r\nincreasing acts of violence against civilians. Clearly,\r\nStates have the primary responsibility in prosecuting the\r\nperpetrators through their national justice system, or,\r\nwhenever and wherever appropriate, through the relevant\r\ninternational criminal tribunals. Until a global\r\nenforcement mechanism is in place to address these\r\ncrimes, ad hoc tribunals may be required whenever\r\nnecessary. The two existing International Criminal\r\nTribunals should be strongly supported by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe strongly condemn attacks on United Nations\r\npersonnel in the field. The Organization has an obligation\r\nto ensure that they are able to safely carry out their\r\nmission in responding to the needs of civilians in armed\r\nconflict, who should have unimpeded access to\r\nhumanitarian assistance. We think it would be fitting for\r\nthe United Nations to pay tribute to the courage and\r\nsacrifices of these humanitarian workers in the same way\r\nthat it honours its uniformed peacekeepers.\r\nMy delegation is gratified that the Secretary-General\r\ngives the issue of globalization the attention it deserves.\r\nWe agree with the concern that he expressed when he\r\nstated that:\r\n“Two years of crisis-induced international financial\r\nturbulence have nonetheless reduced global\r\neconomic growth substantially.” (A/54/1, para. 221)\r\nIndeed, some economies have experienced not just\r\na slowdown but, tragically, even a reversal in hard-earned\r\neconomic growth and a setback in social progress. We\r\nentirely agree with the Secretary-General that\r\n“the world remains vulnerable to similar disruptions\r\nin the future, underlining the need for action to\r\nprevent such a possibility.” (ibid.)\r\nThis is precisely the message my own Prime Minister has\r\nbeen repeating these past two years since the onset of the\r\nEast Asian financial crisis.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nMy delegation is encouraged by the continued\r\nengagement of the General Assembly with globalization\r\nissues, as exemplified by the convening last September of\r\nthe two-day high-level dialogue on the theme of the social\r\nand economic impact of globalization. Similarly, the\r\ninternal debates within the Economic and Social Council,\r\nas well as the two high-level dialogues related to\r\nglobalization that it held with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions last year and early this year, are also\r\nencouraging. Nevertheless, much more needs to be done in\r\nterms of follow-up to those dialogues to ensure that the\r\nconcerns raised in the United Nations, which is a unique\r\nintergovernmental body, receive the due attention from the\r\nBretton Woods institutions.\r\nMy delegation is also pleased that this year there is an\r\nadded dimension in our examination of globalization,\r\nnamely, the linkage between globalization and security. We\r\nagree with the Secretary-General’s view that global market\r\nforces can generate wealth and prosperity, but that where\r\ndevelopment is uneven the result can be increased political\r\ntensions and the risk of instability. In the current context,\r\nit is important for all of us to be alert to this dimension\r\nwhile acknowledging the vast opportunities offered by\r\nglobalization.\r\nThere are new dimensions of globalization which have\r\nyet to be fully understood. These new dimensions can only\r\nbe addressed multilaterally, by the United Nations and by\r\nother international institutions. The task ahead is not to\r\nreverse globalization but to understand it better so that we\r\ncan respond more efficiently and effectively. My delegation\r\nappreciates the fact that the Secretary-General is sensitive\r\nto the various dimensions of globalization. We look forward\r\nto working with him, the Secretariat and other Member\r\nStates to ensure that the Organization can play a positive,\r\nconstructive and meaningful role in the process.\r\nMr. Al-Hinai (Oman): At the outset, I should like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, for his report contained in document A/54/1.\r\nIt is indeed an important document that deserves the\r\nattention of this Assembly. What makes this year’s report\r\ndeserve special consideration is the fact that it comes at a\r\ntime when the Organization and the world at large are\r\npreparing to enter the next millennium. The report should\r\ngive Member States the opportunity to evaluate the past and\r\nreorient themselves for the future.\r\nOman fully agrees with the Secretary-General’s view,\r\nexpressed in paragraph 36 of his report, that “there is no\r\nhigher goal, no deeper commitment and no greater\r\nambition” for this Organization than preventing armed\r\nconflicts. It was established for that purpose, and it should\r\naim to achieve the objective of sparing succeeding\r\ngenerations the scourge of war. This is the greatest\r\nchallenge facing the United Nations.\r\nPreventive diplomacy is a precious tool, and, if\r\nutilized properly, it can save lives and spare costs. We\r\nhave seen this type of quiet diplomacy defuse tensions\r\nand prevent wars. This is a time when sanctions have\r\nbecome the means by which the international community\r\nintervenes, but as these collective measures are losing\r\nfocus and failing to achieve their desired goals, we\r\nbelieve that the time has come for this Organization to\r\nreconsider its methods of operation.\r\nAs the Secretary-General rightly noted, coercive\r\nmeasures can hardly be labelled long-term strategies.\r\nMoreover, they tend more towards doing harm than\r\ntowards restoring international peace and security on a\r\nlong-term basis. For that reason, we fully endorse the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation on the need to\r\nimprove the design and implementation of sanctions\r\nmandated by the Security Council in order to restore the\r\ncredibility of the international regime.\r\nConflicts do not occur spontaneously and without\r\nwarning. Rather, they are the culmination of years of\r\ntension, mistrust and friction between parties. In this\r\nregard, preventive diplomacy, whether it takes the form of\r\nmediation, conciliation or negotiation, is greatly needed to\r\naddress the root causes of conflicts. Long-term prevention\r\nshould embrace a wide-ranging early warning system,\r\nwhich could be established by forging a greater\r\npartnership with regional organizations.\r\nIn an increasingly interdependent world,\r\ndevelopment remains a challenge for many of the\r\ndeveloping countries. This challenge can be met only\r\nthrough well-planned, coordinated and adequately funded\r\ninternational action. Through the collective efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations and other financial institutions such as the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the\r\ninternational community can help the developing countries\r\novercome this challenge. Based on our conviction of the\r\nbenefits of such interdependence, my country looks\r\nforward to joining the World Trade Organization soon. It\r\nhopes to participate in that organization as a full member\r\nand play its role effectively by upholding the fundamental\r\nprinciples of free trade and the development of mutual\r\ncooperation with all nations.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nThe financial crisis of this Organization remains one\r\nof the challenges that deserve our attention, too. Oman has\r\nmaintained a clean record of promptly paying its dues to\r\nthe United Nations. However, we cannot fail to call on\r\nother Members to pay their dues promptly, in full and\r\nwithout conditions in order to allow this Organization to\r\nimplement its programmes and carry out the mandate\r\nexpected of it in the most diligent manner. We also call on\r\nthe Secretary-General to continue the process of\r\nrestructuring the various United Nations bodies. We hope\r\nthis restructuring will be extended to the Security Council\r\nin a manner that will enhance its role and reflect the\r\ncultural and political diversity of the contemporary world,\r\nas well as consolidate the role of emerging forces which\r\nhave come to play an increasingly important role in\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nThe unanimous decision to hold the Millennium\r\nSummit in conjunction with the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will provide the international community\r\nwith a genuine opportunity to issue a declaration which\r\nmay be considered a plan of action, laying down a\r\nredefined approach for economic and social development\r\nfor all people. We believe time and effort should be\r\naccorded to the planning of this historic event, and we\r\nreaffirm our support for the Secretary-General\u0027s introduction\r\nof proposals and ideas aimed at improving the Organization\r\nand its functions. We also believe that dialogue among\r\ncivilizations should constitute the basis for such an\r\napproach, thus marking a new beginning at the start of a\r\nnew millennium in order to reach the objectives that this\r\nOrganization desires and stands for in the years to come.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): My delegation\r\nwould like first of all to pay a well-deserved tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for the consistently remarkable way in\r\nwhich he has been guiding the work of our Organization,\r\nand to convey our thanks for his concise and complete\r\nreport on the work of the Organization. As this is the last\r\nsession before the Millennium Assembly, it deserves\r\nparticular attention and calls for very attentive and sustained\r\nstudy on our part.\r\nAs my delegation will have the opportunity to express\r\nits position and its concerns when we study the various\r\nitems on the agenda here and in the major Committees, I\r\nwill limit myself simply to commenting on a few of the\r\nmatters addressed by the Secretary-General.\r\nFirst of all, the Secretary-General\u0027s observations are\r\nclear-minded and frank: in paragraph 7, he reminds us that\r\n“In terms of violent conflicts, the most worrying\r\ndevelopment in 1998 was a significant increase in the\r\nnumber of wars”. He also notes that peace remains\r\nprecarious in many regions and, in the economic sphere,\r\nthat poverty has continued to increase. Those simple\r\nobservations provide a measure of the magnitude of the\r\nserious challenges facing us as nations.\r\nYet the United Nations is fully and sometimes\r\nsuccessfully involved in many situations, through\r\npeacekeeping operations, good-offices and mediation\r\nmissions and development programmes. The most recent\r\nexample is the organization of the referendum on self-\r\ndetermination in East Timor, despite the unfortunate\r\nevents that followed that consultation. In other cases,\r\nregrettably, there have been obvious failures, because of\r\na lack of political will, or because of delays in putting the\r\nmeasures in place, or because the United Nations was\r\nquite simply unable to deal with the situation. And\r\nsometimes, the United Nations is inclined to apply a\r\nsingle solution to a number of situations, even though it\r\nis obvious that every situation is unique and that each one\r\nrequires a specific solution.\r\nIn that connection, as the organ with the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, the Security Council — the reform and\r\nexpansion of which remain necessary — must play its\r\nrole and demonstrate the same determination and firmness\r\nwith regard to all situations before it, irrespective of\r\nwhere they occur; but at the same time, the General\r\nAssembly, as a principal organ of the United Nations and\r\nas the forum in which the sovereign will of States takes\r\nshape, must assume to the full its role under the Charter.\r\nIt should do this, for example, by taking initiatives in the\r\narea of post-conflict peace-building. It is important to\r\naffirm forcefully and unambiguously that in all cases —\r\nwhether they relate to preventive diplomacy, to\r\npeacekeeping or to the provision of humanitarian\r\nassistance — the consent of States is crucial, as the then\r\nSecretary-General pertinently recalled in his report, “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” (A/47/277).\r\nHere, let me note that in paragraph 66 of the report\r\nbefore the Assembly today the Secretary-General\r\nacknowledges that\r\n“enforcement actions without Security Council\r\nauthorization threaten the very core of the\r\ninternational security system founded on the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. Only the Charter provides a\r\nuniversally accepted legal basis for the use of force”.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nThis is without doubt a perceptive and highly factual\r\nobservation which under all circumstances should guide our\r\nactions and those of the international community in order\r\nto prevent any divergence from international law, which is\r\nobligatory for Member States — for all Member States.\r\nThe promotion of international law is everyone\u0027s\r\nbusiness; we must all participate in the codification of\r\ninternational law. Indeed, it is unacceptable that legal norms\r\nshould be created without our involvement and without our\r\nhaving participated in their formulation. In that connection,\r\nalthough my delegation considers it important that the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) — whose establishment\r\nwe hail — should play a role in deterrence and prevention,\r\nwe would warn against an excessively broad interpretation\r\nof the Statute of the Court. The ICC should not replace\r\nnational courts, which remain solely competent to try\r\ncriminals and tyrants; nor should it become a tool of Power\r\nrivalries. The credibility, and hence the success, of the\r\nCourt requires full respect for the sovereignty and national\r\nlegislation of States and for the norms and principles of\r\ninternational law. International law must not be held\r\nhostage to politics or political scheming, or be at the\r\nexclusive service of Powers that invoke it when it serves\r\ntheir interests and ignore it when it does not. Nor is it to be\r\ntolerated that sovereign States should be the targets of\r\nunilateral coercive measures in flagrant violation of the\r\nnorms of international law and of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\r\nSimilarly, the sensitive issue of Security Council\r\nsanctions is of enormous concern to us. We regret that the\r\nCouncil remains unable to undertake an objective\r\nreassessment of sanctions regimes and has not decided on\r\nthe permanent lifting of such sanctions when the countries\r\nin question have met their obligations. In all situations, the\r\nCouncil should aim to minimize or eliminate the effects of\r\nsanctions on populations, through, as the Secretary-General\r\nhimself proposes in paragraph 124 of his report, “ smart\r\nsanctions\u0027... or by incorporating appropriate and carefully\r\nthought through humanitarian exceptions directly in\r\nSecurity Council resolutions”. In that spirit, my country\r\ncalls for the lifting of the unjust sanctions imposed on Iraq\r\nand on Libya, countries which have fully cooperated with\r\nthe Organization.\r\nIf today there is one shared concern that goes to the\r\nvery heart of the mandate of the United Nations, it is one\r\nthat underlies our solemn undertaking to protect and\r\npromote respect for human dignity everywhere and under\r\nall circumstances: ultimately, the human being must be the\r\nbeneficiary of the progress achieved by human civilization.\r\nIndeed, thanks to the rapid appearance on the stage of\r\nhistory of formerly colonized nations, and to the\r\nphenomenon of globalization — which overcomes\r\ndistinctions, diminishes differences and eliminates\r\nboundaries — the culture of human rights, which is\r\ninherently an evolving culture, is now spreading its\r\ninfluence to the farthest corners of the world.\r\nBut our universal civilization does not seem to be\r\naffronted by the enormous physical and emotional distress\r\nof the billion individuals who live on less than a dollar a\r\nday, of the billion individuals who do not know how to\r\nread or write and who have no access to basic health\r\ncare, or of the one quarter of children in the South who\r\nwill never go to school. In our view, the only worthwhile\r\napproach to this problem encompasses human rights in a\r\ncomprehensive, integrated and indivisible way: all human\r\nrights, which is to say the basic economic, cultural and\r\nsocial needs of every individual, along with civil and\r\npolitical rights.\r\nToday we hear a call to establish the right, or the\r\nduty, of humanitarian intervention as a norm of\r\ninternational law. However well intentioned it may be,\r\nthis proposal raises many questions and concerns because\r\nof its vagueness and because of its inherent risk of serious\r\nabuse. In his capacity as current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), President\r\nAbdelaziz Bouteflika stressed these issues in his address\r\nto the General Assembly on 20 September 1999.\r\nFirst of all, what about State sovereignty, which is\r\nthe very underpinning of the international community?\r\nWhat about respect for the independence and territorial\r\nintegrity of States, as enshrined in the Charter? What\r\nabout respect for the principle of non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States, which is one of the sustaining\r\npillars of international relations? Who is to decide that\r\nthere is an urgent need to intervene in a given State,\r\naccording to what criteria, in what framework, and on the\r\nbasis of what conditions? Is the right of intervention the\r\nprovince of all States, or only of the most powerful\r\namong them? Do small States also have the right to\r\nintervene and the prospect of intervening in the affairs of\r\nlarger States?\r\nHow and where do we draw the line between a\r\nhumanitarian intervention and an intervention for political\r\nor strategic reasons, and when do political considerations\r\nprevail over humanitarian conditions?\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nWhat, finally, is the position of the international\r\ncommunity with respect to the immense suffering of\r\nhundreds of millions of individuals condemned to illiteracy,\r\npoverty, disease and underdevelopment in dozens of\r\ncountries of the South which are largely victims of an\r\nunfair economic system? Are those individuals also subject\r\nto the right to intervene, or should this be limited to\r\nviolations of civil and political rights?\r\nThese questions all bring us back to the need for a\r\nserious, comprehensive and calm examination of this matter\r\nand its many political and legal implications, removed from\r\nany political or propaganda calculation and without\r\npolemics, on the basis of respect for the sovereign equality\r\nof States and the standards of international law, as well as\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries, as\r\nwell as those of the Group of 77 and China, have given\r\ntheir reply. At a meeting held on the fringes of the work of\r\nthis Assembly, they rejected the right of humanitarian\r\ninterference, since it has no legal basis, either in the United\r\nNations Charter or in the general principles of international\r\nlaw.\r\nIn his report the Secretary-General devotes several\r\nparagraphs to Africa, thus bearing witness to the particular\r\ninterest of our Organization in my continent, which is faced\r\nwith numerous and complex challenges, as the debate of 29\r\nand 30 September in the Security Council strikingly\r\nillustrated.\r\nAs current Chairman of the Organization of African\r\nUnity, President Bouteflika had occasion to reassert before\r\nthe Assembly Africa’s determination to stand up for itself,\r\nassume its role and take its place in the concert of nations.\r\nI therefore simply recall that Africa has never been in a\r\nbetter position than it is today to rely on the support of the\r\ninternational community and to fully benefit from it. Africa\r\nexpects the resolute support of the international community\r\nin its recovery efforts.\r\nThe role of the United Nations and of this Assembly\r\nis crucial in this regard. That is why, as representative of\r\nthe current Chairman of the OAU, I sent on 4 October a\r\nletter to the President of the General Assembly asking him\r\nto set up the working group that the General Assembly\r\ndecided to create by resolution 53/92, adopted on 7\r\nDecember 1998. We are convinced that it will be extremely\r\nuseful for implementing the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General on Africa and for the promotion of\r\npeace, security and development on the continent.\r\nI would like to conclude by offering a few brief\r\nideas on a topic which has become very fashionable, that\r\nof globalization.\r\nPresented as a bearer of universal prosperity and\r\npossessing all the virtues, globalization, a phenomenon\r\nboth irreversible and irresistible, raises many questions\r\ntoday because of its dysfunctional aspects and its threat to\r\nmarginalize the poorest and most vulnerable. Indeed,\r\nunless we are careful — as the Asian crisis and its effects\r\namply demonstrated — instead of being a factor for\r\nintegration, globalization could become a factor of\r\nexclusion in a world where already many nations live at\r\nthe edge of civilization and progress.\r\nFaced with this situation, we must together restore\r\nto globalization its initial purpose by introducing agreed\r\nformulas for regulation, coordination and control.\r\nThose are the ideas that I wanted to share with the\r\nAssembly on the phenomenon of globalization and on\r\nother important matters that we give the Secretary-\r\nGeneral credit for raising, enabling us to have an\r\ninteresting as well as, we hope, a productive debate.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova): I join previous\r\nspeakers in thanking the Secretary-General for his\r\nanalytical report on the work of the Organization, which\r\nemphasizes a comprehensive approach to the current\r\nsituation on international peace and security and economic\r\nand social development. I am convinced that the\r\nSecretary-General’s report and other reports elaborated by\r\nthe Secretariat will greatly help the work of delegations\r\nduring the present session.\r\nAs the report makes clear and as we increasingly see\r\nfor ourselves, the humanitarian challenge is a\r\nconsequence, inter alia, of the internal and inter-State\r\nconflicts and natural disasters that have disturbed the\r\ninternational community this year.\r\nOur delegation shares the Secretary General’s view\r\non the main causes of today’s internal conflicts. From our\r\nperspective, his statement in paragraphs 17 and 18 needs\r\nto be particularly emphasized. Indeed, countries that are\r\nafflicted by war suffer from economic decline. At the\r\nsame time, the existing inequality between domestic and\r\nsocial groups, rather than poverty, generates tensions and\r\nconflicts in society. In some instances the impact of\r\nradical market-oriented economic reforms and structural\r\nadjustment programmes imposed without compensating\r\nsocial policies can undermine political stability and lead\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nto conflictual situations. That is why the assistance provided\r\nby international financial institutions is so important for\r\ncountries with economies in transition. Otherwise, the high\r\nsocial cost of reforms could undermine the democratization\r\nprocess in most of the newly independent States.\r\nIn our view, the United Nations should also pay\r\nspecial attention to and be more energetically involved in,\r\nresolving so-called frozen conflicts caused by aggressive\r\nseparatist movements supported from outside.\r\nUnfortunately, this issue is not sufficiently reflected in the\r\nreport.\r\nThe Secretary-General emphasizes in his report that\r\npeacekeeping operations remain a key instrument to resolve\r\nconflicts and crisis situations after all means of preventive\r\ndiplomacy have been exhausted. In this regard, we should\r\nmention that the past year has indeed been a tumultuous\r\none for United Nations peacekeeping. The United Nations\r\nis facing new challenges with the creation of the\r\nlarge-scale, multidimensional and unprecedented operations\r\nin Kosovo and now in East Timor. We welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to coordinate these and other\r\npeacekeeping activities more efficiently.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova is convinced that the best\r\nstrategy for maintaining international peace and security is\r\nto address the root causes of conflicts. In this context, we\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General\u0027s efforts to place increased\r\nemphasis on preventive diplomacy, in particular by further\r\nimproving the United Nations early-warning system. The\r\nneed, advocated by the Secretary-General, to make a\r\ntransition from a “culture of reaction” to a “culture of\r\nprevention” is worthy of our full recognition and support.\r\nThe conflicts in Kosovo and Rwanda have sharply\r\nraised for the international community the question of the\r\nrelationship between the concepts of sovereignty and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States, on the one\r\nhand, and the imperative need to observe human rights, on\r\nthe other hand. As we have seen, disagreements within the\r\nSecurity Council have impeded its discharging its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity in this area. This fact has justly drawn criticism\r\nfrom many international actors. At the same time, we share\r\nthe Secretary General\u0027s assessment that\r\n“enforcement actions without Security Council\r\nauthorization threaten the very core of the\r\ninternational security system founded on the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.” (A/54/1, para. 66)\r\nTherefore, our delegation, like others, encourages and\r\nsupports further discussions on how the necessity for\r\nhumanitarian intervention can be brought into conformity\r\nwith the United Nations main objective of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. This issue appears to be\r\none of the main challenges of the United Nations at the\r\nthreshold of the next millennium.\r\nA dominant theme in the recently concluded general\r\ndebate was globalization. We appreciate the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to adapt our Organization to a\r\nglobalized society. Drawing the attention of the\r\ninternational community to the transnationalization of\r\n“uncivil” elements, along with the emergence of a global\r\ncivil society, the Secretary-General indicated that this is\r\nan area that needs our concerted action. In this respect,\r\nwe note that the report records the first positive results\r\nachieved by the United Nations in dealing with problems\r\nraised by globalization.\r\nI would like to underline in this connection that it is\r\nimperative that the countries with economies in transition\r\nshould also benefit, along with the developing countries,\r\nfrom additional official development assistance and debt\r\nrelief. We think that enabling newly independent countries\r\nwith economies in transition to be effectively integrated\r\ninto the globalized world economy is in everyone\u0027s\r\ninterest.\r\nOur delegation fully shares the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nemphasis on strengthening the international legal order.\r\nThe report stresses three main aspects: the human rights\r\nregime, the activity of ad hoc international tribunals, and\r\nthe recent establishment of a permanent International\r\nCriminal Court. In this context, I would like to inform the\r\nAssembly that the Republic of Moldova intends to ratify\r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court in the first\r\nhalf of the next year, thus contributing to the early entry\r\ninto force of this document.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to point out that the\r\nRepublic of Moldova strongly supports the United\r\nNations process of modernization. My Government highly\r\nappreciates the important work performed by the United\r\nNations during the last year.\r\nWe hope that next year\u0027s Millennium Assembly will\r\nprovide an opportunity to identify the challenges awaiting\r\nthe international community and to strengthen the global\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nleadership of the United Nations for the next century. A\r\nreformed and strengthened United Nations will undoubtedly\r\nplay a crucial role in the fulfilment of the tasks that lie\r\nahead.\r\nMr. Kanju (Pakistan): In his address to the General\r\nAssembly, as well as his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, the Secretary-General has argued in favour of\r\nbuilding a global culture of conflict prevention and has\r\nissued a call for strategies to avert or meet natural disasters\r\nor emergencies. This is a most laudable objective. He has\r\nproposed international preventive action under United\r\nNations authority to meet the two challenges.\r\nAny study of wars and conflicts clearly shows that,\r\nunfortunately, massive and systematic violations of human\r\nrights occur in conflict situations. These violations are used\r\nas a weapon of war in brutal campaigns to secure the\r\nsubmission of the targeted people. This has held true in the\r\nconflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Rwanda,\r\nJammu and Kashmir and elsewhere.\r\nThe Secretary-General has advocated international\r\npreventive action in all humanitarian emergencies as a\r\nconsequence of wars or conflicts, without making any\r\ndistinction on the basis of geographical, political or other\r\nconsiderations. The principal proposition that has been put\r\nforward is that\r\n“massive and systematic violations of human rights —\r\nwherever they take place — should not be allowed to\r\nstand.” (A/54/PV.4)\r\nPakistan believes that the concept of humanitarian\r\nintervention requires careful examination and analysis, in\r\nview of its enormous implications for all Member States.\r\nWe must be clear and certain about the purpose, scope and\r\nlegitimacy of such an enterprise. It is our view that serious\r\nthought needs to be given to the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nproposal which in some instances may well contain inner\r\ncontradictions. Until such time as a thorough discussion of\r\nvarious postulations made by the Secretary-General can be\r\nundertaken, at the national level as well as at the level of\r\nthe international community, the merit or otherwise of\r\nimplementing these proposals cannot be decided. Pakistan\r\nwill study them with the utmost care, which they deserve,\r\nand will provide its detailed views on them in due course.\r\nThere are, however, certain fundamental parameters within\r\nwhich these proposals have to be viewed.\r\nFirst, the principle of State sovereignty and non-\r\ninterference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of\r\nStates must be respected. However, this principle cannot\r\nbe extended to situations in which people under colonial\r\nrule, foreign occupation or alien domination are struggling\r\nfor their inalienable rights to self-determination.\r\nSecond, the central role of the General Assembly, as\r\nthe only body with universal representation in the United\r\nNations, must be maintained and in fact strengthened.\r\nThere should also be no encroachment by the Security\r\nCouncil on the role of other United Nations bodies. The\r\nSecurity Council must operate strictly within its mandate\r\nin discussing issues of peace and security.\r\nThird, a clear distinction must be maintained\r\nbetween humanitarian crises as a result of wars, conflicts\r\nor disputes which by their very nature constitute threats\r\nto international peace and security and other human rights\r\nissues. The latter clearly fall within the purview of the\r\nUnited Nations human rights system and lie outside the\r\ncompetence of the Security Council.\r\nFourth, for humanitarian interventions to find general\r\nacceptance they must have legitimacy under international\r\nlaw. They must fully conform to the provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and be undertaken only with the\r\nexplicit authority of the Security Council, after a clear\r\nbreach of, or threat to, international peace and security\r\nhas been established.\r\nFive, international humanitarian interventions as a\r\npreventive measure can be credible only if they are\r\napplied to all situations. There must be no selectivity, nor\r\nmust they be media-driven. They must be based on the\r\nprinciple of equal justice for all. Otherwise, such\r\ninterventions will erode the confidence of the international\r\ncommunity in the United Nations.\r\nSix, the underlying causes, not merely the symptoms\r\nof conflicts and disputes, must be addressed in order to\r\nfind lasting solutions to conflicts. These could range from\r\nthe free exercise of the right of peoples to\r\nself-determination to the removal of social and economic\r\ninequities.\r\nSeven, in keeping with his own reasoning, the\r\nSecretary-General should play a more active role, in\r\nconformity with the responsibilities entrusted to him by\r\nthe Charter, in situations where massive violations of\r\nhuman rights occur against people under colonial rule or\r\nforeign occupation.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nWe fully agree with and support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for the creation of an effective early-warning\r\nsystem for disaster prevention, as well as adequate\r\ninternational emergency-response capabilities. While such\r\nmeasures seek to address the immediate consequences of\r\nnatural disasters, it is imperative to evolve strategies aimed\r\nat equitable and sustainable development in order to meet\r\nthe diverse goals of international peace and security.\r\nPeace and development are indivisible. This is even\r\nmore true against the backdrop of the process of\r\nglobalization. A complex and multidimensional\r\nphenomenon, globalization is shaping the contours of\r\ninternational relations, particularly in the economic and\r\nsocial arena. The developed countries have been extolling\r\nthe benefits and blessings of globalization. The developing\r\ncountries have seen nothing but the globalization of misery.\r\nThis became evidently clear when the hard-won growth and\r\nprosperity of the East Asian countries fell victim to the\r\nforces of globalization. Globalization has thus increased the\r\nvulnerability of the developing countries to external factors,\r\nleaving them at the mercy of a few rich individuals, mega-\r\ncorporations and undemocratic financial institutions.\r\nThe members of the international community,\r\nparticularly the developed countries, cannot absolve\r\nthemselves of the responsibility to mitigate the sufferings of\r\nthe peoples in the developing countries caused by this\r\nprocess. We must take immediate action to check the forces\r\nbeing unleashed by globalization, which have played havoc\r\nwith the economic and social development of the\r\ndeveloping countries. The Secretary-General has recognized\r\nthat the responsibility of addressing its negative\r\nconsequences primarily rests with the world’s most\r\nadvanced economies. We agree with him and call upon\r\nthem to take urgent action in this regard.\r\nWhile the Secretary-General’s report also mentions the\r\nimpact of globalization on environment, it does not address\r\nthis issue in any detail. Environmental issues, no doubt,\r\nrequire global action. We believe that, in accordance with\r\nthe principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities, all\r\ncountries should play their due role in promoting the\r\nsustained development of developing countries. The United\r\nNations has a central role to play in ensuring that the\r\nprocess of globalization is based on equity, justice and the\r\ninclusion of all members of the international community.\r\nSince 1997, the Secretary-General has undertaken\r\nmajor reforms of funds and programmes relating to the\r\nUnited Nations operational activities for development.\r\nUnfortunately, these reforms have not resulted in any of the\r\nincrease in funding that was promised by the traditional\r\ndonor countries at the time of the adoption of these\r\nreforms. In fact, the resources at the disposal of such\r\nfunds have been constantly dwindling.\r\nTo compensate for the depleted resources, the\r\nSecretary-General is exploring private-sector partnerships.\r\nWe would like to stress, in this context, that such\r\nresources can only complement the resources provided by\r\ndonor countries and cannot become a substitute, nor\r\nshould such resources distort in any manner the priorities\r\nof the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes.\r\nThe Secretary-General has informed the General\r\nAssembly about the increased cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\ninternational financial institutions and the specialized\r\nagencies on integrating human rights norms into the\r\ndevelopment process. Such integration is the prerogative\r\nof Governments and should be undertaken through an\r\nintergovernmental process. There have been repeated\r\nefforts to make human rights a cross-cutting issue,\r\nparticularly in the development arena. We believe,\r\ninstead, that development should be a cross-cutting issue\r\nfor the international community. In our view, the best\r\nway to promote adherence to universally agreed human\r\nrights norms is through the implementation of the right to\r\ndevelopment and through poverty eradication.\r\nWhile the United Nations is launching initiatives to\r\nmeet the goal of halving absolute poverty by 2015, the\r\nnegative consequences of globalization have increased the\r\nnumbers of people living below the poverty line. We must\r\naddress the root causes of poverty and undertake long-\r\nterm strategies by creating an enabling international\r\neconomic environment to pursue the goal of poverty\r\neradication.\r\nI would like to conclude by thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive, thought-provoking and\r\nchallenging report, which is bound to lead to serious\r\ndiscussions and debate in the months ahead.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): At the outset, I would like to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his excellent and\r\nthought-provoking report to the General Assembly on the\r\nwork of the Organization.\r\nAmong its many important messages, the report\r\nhighlights the ever stronger interrelationship between the\r\nvarious activities of the United Nations and its agencies.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nHumanitarian action cannot be seen in isolation from efforts\r\nat conflict resolution and peacekeeping. Economic\r\ndevelopment includes issues such as debt relief, external\r\nassistance, good governance and human rights. T h i s\r\ninterdependence represents a challenge both to national\r\nGovernments and to the United Nations system. We must\r\nensure that the activities of different bodies are coordinated\r\nin order to achieve our objectives of peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Secretary-General draws particular attention to the\r\ndisturbing increase in natural disasters in recent years. It is\r\ncrucial to learn more about the causes and the consequences\r\nof natural disasters, both from a humanitarian and from an\r\nenvironmental perspective. Within the United Nations, there\r\nare a large number of bodies dealing with humanitarian\r\nemergencies, the environment, climate change and man-\r\nmade disasters. Improved coordination of their efforts can\r\ncontribute to a better understanding of the problems and the\r\nsolutions.\r\nAs regards conflict resolution and peace-building, the\r\nSecretary-General points out that the international\r\ncommunity has a tendency to ignore some protracted\r\nconflicts and to concentrate insufficiently on preventive\r\naction and early warning. I believe there is a broad\r\nconsensus that this is a fundamental problem. It is\r\nobviously much less costly — both in financial and in\r\nhuman terms — to prevent than to repair, and nothing is\r\nmore costly than doing neither. What the Secretary-General\r\ndescribes as forgotten conflicts can no longer remain\r\nforgotten.\r\nI would like to recall the establishment of the Trust\r\nFund for Preventive Action, to which several Governments,\r\nincluding my own, have made voluntary contributions. It is\r\nmy understanding that the Fund has been a useful\r\nmechanism for the Secretary-General in a number of\r\npreventive diplomatic efforts. We shall continue to support\r\nthe Fund and urge as many Governments as possible to do\r\nthe same. At the same time, I would like to reiterate our\r\nsupport for the Secretary-General’s plea to the Fifth\r\nCommittee some days ago. It is now high time that we all\r\nmake the efforts needed to provide sufficient regular budget\r\nfunding for the conflict-prevention efforts of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe conflicts in Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra Leone\r\nhave caused immeasurable suffering for hundreds of\r\nthousands of people and placed new burdens upon the\r\nresponse system of the United Nations. I am happy to note\r\nthat the United Nations is intensely involved in the efforts\r\nto find solutions to these conflicts, in close cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations.\r\nThe diplomatic and peace-building activities of the\r\nUnited Nations with regard to the conflict in East Timor\r\nare but the latest example of the importance of collective\r\naction by the international community to ensure\r\ninternational peace and security, through the effective\r\nengagement of the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nOn a matter of particular interest to Norway, I would\r\nlike to join the Secretary-General in expressing optimism\r\nregarding mine clearance, assistance to mine victims and\r\nimplementation of the Ottawa Convention. The challenges\r\nin this field are enormous, yet the international\r\ncommunity has made progress. Additional ratification of\r\nthe Convention would be most welcome.\r\nMy Government welcomes the fact that the\r\nSecretary-General in his report deals extensively with the\r\nsituation in Africa. Despite many signs of significant\r\nprogress, more than half of the population of sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica still lives in absolute poverty. The AIDS pandemic\r\nis a taking a heavy toll. Promising conflict-resolution\r\nefforts and democratization processes in many African\r\ncountries notwithstanding, we have not succeeded to the\r\nextent we had hoped.\r\nAs outlined by the Secretary-General, the United\r\nNations is involved in a large number of development\r\nprogrammes, humanitarian efforts and conflict resolution\r\nactivities in Africa. Progress is, however, dependent on\r\nresources that in too many cases are scarce. I agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General that Africa’s problems must remain\r\nof the highest priority for the Organization. Many\r\nconflicts on the continent are protracted and easily\r\nforgotten. They may not get the attention of the\r\ninternational media, but this must not guide the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations and its Member States.\r\nImportant reforms of the Organization have been\r\nimplemented. We highly appreciate the fact that the\r\nSecretary-General is dedicated to pursue the reform\r\nprocess further. In these efforts he can rely on our full\r\nsupport. It is commendable that a record high number of\r\nMember States have met their budget assessments for\r\n1998 and all prior years. But major arrears remain to be\r\npaid in full. A determined reform process should go hand-\r\nin-hand with fulfilment of financial obligations. The\r\nSecretary-General envisages that none of the\r\nOrganization’s debt to Member States can be paid in\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\n1999, and certainly not in full. This is a disturbing state of\r\naffairs which reduces the Organization’s flexibility. It is in\r\nevery Member State’s interest that such a situation is not\r\nallowed to prevail.\r\nMr. Picasso (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): The Peruvian\r\ndelegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for the\r\nreport on the work of the Organization before us. It reflects\r\nthe situation that the Organization is undergoing in its\r\ndifferent spheres, as well as the challenges faced by the\r\ninternational community at the dawn of a new century.\r\nThe Secretary-General reminds us of the complex\r\nnature of the humanitarian task that we have to tackle now\r\nand during the next millennium, as well as how important\r\nit is for the member countries of the United Nations to\r\ncontribute to collective security and the stability and\r\npredictability of the international system, thus ensuring the\r\ndevelopment of our societies.\r\nUnderstanding the basic causes of natural disasters\r\nimplies quantifying, inter alia, the changes experienced by\r\nthe ozone layer, greenhouse gas emissions, the production\r\nof drinking water, the effects of deforestation, the use of\r\nnew crops and the sustainability of high demographic levels\r\nin urban areas. Significant progress has been achieved in\r\nthis regard, thanks to the sponsorship of Governments and\r\nof non-governmental entities and their contribution to\r\nspecialized regional forums.\r\nAlert calls have been sent out by many countries in\r\ndifferent regions of the globe. The Central American and\r\nCaribbean countries are now facing a dramatic need to\r\nrecalculate their forecasts for preventing future damage\r\nfrom Atlantic hurricanes. Similarly, countries on the west\r\ncoast of South America must reallocate their resources to\r\nface in the coming years climate changes and their\r\nconsequences: losses of crops and of sea food exports, as\r\nwell as damage to existing public infrastructure. All of this\r\nwill require an immediate response once the disaster or\r\ncalamity has occurred, but a long-term estimate.\r\nFor the Peruvian Government, the matter of natural\r\ndisasters is of high priority. Throughout its history our\r\ncountry has been severely affected by floods, droughts and\r\nearthquakes.\r\nAs may be recalled, the southern oscillation, the El\r\nNiño phenomenon, of 1982-1983, severely affected Peru,\r\ncausing nearly $1 billion in losses and a drop in the gross\r\ndomestic product of about 11 per cent. The effects of the\r\n1998 El Niño, while severe in their intensity in Peru, were\r\nnot as serious, due to the emphasis given to prevention by\r\nthe civil defence system promoted by the Peruvian\r\nExecutive. Its strategy for handling the intense rain and\r\ndrought included three stages: prevention, emergency\r\nassistance while the phenomenon was occurring, and\r\nrehabilitation to repair the damage. Prevention consisted\r\nof measures to protect the lives and health of populations\r\nlocated in the most vulnerable areas, to protect production\r\nand the social and economic infrastructure and to avoid\r\nparalysis and interruption of basic public services, and for\r\ndrainage of water and guarantee of public order.\r\nHuman and material losses were lower as a result of\r\nthese measures. Production, nevertheless, shrank\r\nconsiderably. The gross domestic product barely grew by\r\n0.3 per cent, due to uncontrollable effects in the fishing\r\nsector.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe resources for these preventive measures were\r\nessentially domestic, while others came from loans from\r\nthe Inter-American Development Bank and the World\r\nBank. In this sense, we believe it important that the\r\nSecretary-General has emphasized the need for\r\ninternational assistance to prepare for natural disasters as\r\nwell as the benefits of exchanging experiences. Peru has\r\nan abundance of experience in this area that it is willing\r\nto share with other countries.\r\nAs our delegation stated during the substantive\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council in July this\r\nyear, it is extremely important that there be recognition of\r\nthe need for a global approach to humanitarian crises.\r\nThis implies clear priorities, particularly in planning, and\r\neffective and efficient action by the agencies on the\r\nground.\r\nWe acknowledge that, in spite of great efforts, the\r\nresponse is still insufficient. There is a worrying sectoral\r\nand geographical imbalance in humanitarian aid that must\r\nbe corrected if we wish to reverse the present trend,\r\nwhich is endangering the long-term prospects of the\r\neffectiveness of humanitarian action.\r\nWhile emphasizing the imperative need for the\r\npolitical will on the part of States to facilitate the access\r\nof needy populations to assistance and cooperation, it\r\nseems to us equally valuable that the Secretary-General\r\nhas included, as the first point in his annual report, a\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nreference to the importance of developing a culture of\r\nprevention to deal with natural disasters.\r\nTraditionally, our region considers that conflicts must\r\nbe avoided, and that if they nevertheless occur a peaceful\r\nsolution must be sought. All possible means of dialogue\r\nand negotiation should be exhausted for this purpose. As\r\nindicated in the United Nations Charter, force may be used\r\nonly within the scope of Article 51, since resorting to it,\r\neven when, for the noblest of causes, will lead to an\r\nincrease in violence, and it is unlikely to be the means to\r\nachieve a lasting solution for any problem.\r\nThe Security Council, charged with maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, is the sole body that can\r\nauthorize the use of force, and it is the international\r\ncommunity\u0027s mechanism for collective security, intended to\r\nprotect the common interest rather than that of an individual\r\nor a specific group. The unilateral use of force, ignoring the\r\nCouncil\u0027s jurisdiction, is therefore difficult to accept,\r\nbecause it undermines the foundations of the civilized\r\ncoexistence of States in the modern world.\r\nFor Peru, full adherence to the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter, which govern the\r\ninternational system, is fundamental — not only in words,\r\nbut in deeds. Respect for the territorial integrity and\r\npolitical independence of all States continues to be the\r\nessential principle of the Charter. The juridical organization\r\nthat the international community has managed to build, with\r\ngreat effort, to avoid war and combine our work for peace\r\nand for the benefit of all humanity, must be preserved,\r\nsince the consequences of a weakening of the role of\r\ninternational law in relations between States would be\r\nextremely serious.\r\nWe agree with the priority that the Secretary-General\r\ngives to measures to prevent international conflicts. We also\r\nagree with him about the need for peace agreements to\r\nhave the necessary economic support.A concrete case is the\r\npeace agreements between Peru and Ecuador,which are\r\nspecifically mentioned in the report. Under these\r\ncomprehensive agreements, economic integration and the\r\ndevelopment of joint projects are essential. They constitute\r\na modern formula that is not limited to resolving pending\r\nproblems from the past, but contains original elements for\r\nthe protection of the environment, free navigation in rivers,\r\nreductions in tariffs and liberalization of trade, confidence-\r\nbuilding measures and an extensive border integration\r\nagreement, with projects worth $3 billion to be carried out\r\nover 10 years.\r\nThe populations of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border\r\nareas, with high poverty levels, have placed their hopes\r\non the “peace dividend” and solidly on the resources that\r\ncould be obtained from the international community for\r\nthe binational development plan for the border region at\r\nthe meeting of the Consultative Group for the\r\nReinforcement of the Peace, to be held in Paris next 29\r\nand 30 November.\r\nMy country wishes to underline the importance of\r\ninternational cooperation for development with regard to\r\nsecurity, and regrets that the basic funds of the principal\r\nagencies providing aid to developing countries continue\r\nto show negative growth; that will substantially affect the\r\nneediest countries where there are often security\r\nproblems, basically because of a lack of resources for\r\nbare necessities.\r\nPeru strongly agrees that the elimination of poverty\r\nshould be considered one of the important goals of the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. As the sole\r\ninternational organization whose mandate includes peace,\r\nsecurity, development and human rights, the United\r\nNations is exceptionally qualified to tackle that goal\r\nglobally. In this sense, we hail the work of the\r\nAdministrative Committee on Coordination in drafting the\r\naction plan against poverty and sending it in October\r\n1998 to all United Nations resident coordinators and\r\ncountry teams. We hope that this plan will contribute to\r\nachieving the goal of reducing absolute poverty by 50 per\r\ncent before 2015. Peru has drawn up a strategy for the\r\nreduction of poverty that has allowed us to restrain,\r\nstabilize and then reduce poverty; extreme poverty in Peru\r\nwas reduced from 27 per cent to 14 per cent between\r\n1990 and 1997.\r\nFinally, Peru is pleased that there is an ever greater\r\nand more effective coordination between all United\r\nNations bodies with regard to the elimination of poverty,\r\nand that there is an adequate follow-up to the agreements\r\nreached at conferences on social development convened\r\nby the United Nations. In this context, we support the link\r\nproposed in the report between the subjects of peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Powles (New Zealand): I would like to place on\r\nrecord my delegation’s gratitude to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive and thoughtful report on the work\r\nof the Organization this year (A/54/1).\r\nAt this late hour I would like to comment briefly on\r\njust two aspects. As the President suggested in his\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nsumming up of the general debate last Saturday, the subject\r\nof humanitarian intervention, which is addressed in the\r\nreport and which the Secretary-General made the major\r\ntheme of his statement at the beginning of the general\r\ndebate, has provoked a good deal of discussion.\r\nMany participants in the general debate, including my\r\nForeign Minister, The Right Honourable Don McKinnon,\r\ncommented upon the Secretary-General’s argument\r\nconcerning the need to reconcile universal legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness in defence of human rights. It was my\r\nMinister’s clear view that the Security Council had a duty\r\nto take appropriate action when confronted with\r\nhumanitarian disasters, including genocide and the most\r\nserious crimes against humanity, and that such action\r\nshould never be held hostage to the veto.\r\nMassive abuses of human rights, whether in Rwanda\r\nin 1994, or in Kosovo earlier this year, or in the terror\r\nunleashed on the population of East Timor after they had\r\nexercised their free choice in the United Nations ballot at\r\nthe end of August, have the potential to endanger the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and are the\r\nproper business of the Council.\r\nNotwithstanding this, a good deal has been said over\r\nthe last two weeks about national sovereignty versus the\r\nright of humanitarian intervention. For my delegation this\r\nis a sterile debate and one that unfortunately has taken on\r\nmuch of the baggage of the North-South stand-off which\r\nbedevils so much of our work here. No useful conclusion\r\nis likely to come of it.\r\nThe way ahead is rarely illuminated by antagonism,\r\nand particularly not by disputation between one highly\r\nabstract concept and another. We would rather put our faith\r\nin the common sense and compassion of the people who\r\nare ultimately responsible for sending us here — our\r\nrespective publics. In this age of rapidly increasing\r\ninterconnectedness, there is a much wider awareness of\r\nevents around the globe. Publics demand that their\r\nGovernments act through the Security Council if necessary\r\nto try to put a stop to outrageous, wide-scale abuses of\r\nhuman rights, wherever they may occur. And if the Security\r\nCouncil fails to act, it does indeed risk losing its reason for\r\nbeing in the eyes of our publics. It becomes irrelevant. This\r\nis the political reality.\r\nThe challenge for us at the United Nations is to ensure\r\nthat the Charter is implemented in such a way as to meet\r\nthe realistic — and, I would underline, realistic —\r\nexpectations of “We the peoples”, in whose name the\r\nCharter is written.\r\nFinally, and on quite a different aspect of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, I would like to compliment\r\nhim on his account of the management of change in the\r\nOrganization over the past year. We are fully supportive\r\nof the Secretary-General’s efforts, which have already\r\ndelivered tangible improvements in the overall\r\nmanagement of the United Nations, and we look forward\r\nto continued development of the results-based budget\r\napproach, including the prototype budget to be submitted\r\nshortly.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We are\r\ndiscussing today one of the most important items on the\r\nagenda of this session: the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the Work of the Organization. It deals with\r\nhumanitarian challenges, and we would like to express\r\nour thanks to the Secretary-General for the interest he has\r\npaid to this topic. We believe that the review of the\r\nevents of the past year and of the activities of the\r\nOrganization provides ample material for more serious\r\ndebate among Member States.\r\nThe humanitarian situations that we face from time\r\nto time and that cause tragedies and suffering for human\r\nbeings go beyond the borders of one State and are caused\r\nby several factors. Sometimes they result from natural\r\ndisasters and at other times from man-made disasters.\r\nThe latter are known as conflicts or disputes and can\r\nbe classified as follows: first, conflicts inside a State\r\ncaused by another State; secondly, conflicts caused by\r\nrebel groups inside States; thirdly, complicated conflicts\r\nthat involve several countries in the region and are fanned\r\nby external elements; and, finally, conflicts within States\r\nwhere there is no Government or central authority.\r\nThese conflicts and the differences between them\r\nmake it imperative for us to find different ways to deal\r\nwith and find solutions for them. We have to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive approach to deal with all the root causes,\r\nespecially the main sources of social and economic\r\nbackwardness. We should not concentrate on force as a\r\nmeans of solving disputes. It would not be reasonable for\r\nus to use force in a conflict caused by a rebel group, an\r\noutlaw group, within a State that has a Government and\r\na central authority, because equal measures would thus\r\nhave been applied in cases that were unequal in terms of\r\nlaw or logic.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nMy delegation feels that the international community\r\nshould concentrate on supporting and promoting regional\r\nefforts to resolve disputes through peaceful means. We\r\nbelieve that if the political will exists on the part of the\r\ninternational community, particularly of the large countries,\r\nit would then lead to the resolution of conflicts and would\r\nenable us to avoid human tragedies. It would also spare us\r\nthe evil and dangers of intervention by force, about which\r\nmany countries have expressed reservations in view of its\r\ncontravention of two important principles of international\r\nlaw that have governed international relations for over five\r\ndecades: respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nsafety of States and non-interference in their internal affairs.\r\nHow can we justify absolute humanitarian intervention\r\nwhen we are still debating the question from three different\r\nviewpoints? One kind of intervention in humanitarian\r\nsituations is based on the subjective considerations of some\r\npowerful countries; another kind is based on the selective\r\nuse of force, depending on whether or not an important\r\nsituation affects national interests; and in yet other cases,\r\nforce is used only if there is a need to deal with a\r\nhumanitarian disaster.\r\nIn all three cases there is the danger that a political\r\ndecision might be influenced by media coverage of\r\nhumanitarian crises. Perhaps the crisis in Somalia is a good\r\nexample of this risk.\r\nImages of hungry children prompted the\r\nAdministration of President George Bush to send American\r\nforces to Mogadishu to help distribute food. However, the\r\nAdministration of President Clinton had to withdraw those\r\nforces months later, when American citizens were exposed\r\nto images of a dead American Ranger being dragged\r\nthrough the streets of Mogadishu. What was the outcome of\r\nthat intervention? It was more chaos, violence and the\r\ndisintegration of the State.\r\nSome officials in these powerful countries have\r\nblatantly said that in an age of information and technology\r\nwe can regard television — particularly Cable News\r\nNetwork (CNN) — as the sixteenth member of the Security\r\nCouncil. These same officials have apparently forgotten that\r\nCNN also carried the missile attack against the Al-Shifah\r\npharmaceutical plant in my country as soon as the\r\naggression took place. The Council had not even begun to\r\ndiscuss the consequences of that aggression — particularly\r\nthe humanitarian consequences of that unjustified and\r\nunilateral action, which went beyond the provisions of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and the principles of\r\ninternational law and humanitarian law. Some believe that\r\nvirtue is their exclusive purview.\r\nIn light of what I have said, it becomes clear that the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s review of the concept of humanitarian\r\nsecurity still needs more debate, discussion and research.\r\nWe are fully convinced that the General Assembly, being\r\nthe most representative and democratic of forums, is the\r\nultimate body to assume this task until consensus is\r\nreached. Without this, we cannot see any way of\r\nimplementing that concept.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to refer to what my\r\ncountry\u0027s Minister for External relations told the\r\nAssembly last week:\r\n“We share the Secretary-General\u0027s concern on this\r\nmatter. We reaffirm the importance of maximizing\r\ncollective efforts to eliminate the causes of conflicts\r\nbefore they erupt and of using all available means to\r\nput an end to them.\r\n“We believe, however, that any actions taken or\r\nmeans used must have the consent and agreement of\r\nthe State concerned and must be within the\r\nframework of international laws and standards,\r\nparticularly those of the United Nations Charter.”\r\n(A/54/PV.19)\r\nAn absolute call to interfere in the internal affairs of\r\nStates outside these frameworks, and in the absence of an\r\ninternational, just, democratic and transparent system,\r\nmeans ushering in an age of chaos and of the hegemony\r\nof the powerful over the weak.\r\nI would also like to refer to the fact that President\r\nAbdelaziz Bouteflika, the current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), has summarized\r\nthe fears of small and vulnerable countries with regard to\r\nhumanitarian intervention by saying that they are very\r\nsensitive about anything having to do with their\r\nsovereignty; not only because this represents their last line\r\nof defence against the laws of an unjust world, but also\r\nbecause they do not participate effectively in the adoption\r\nof Security Council resolutions or in the monitoring of\r\ntheir implementation.\r\nThere are other aspects in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on which we would like to comment.\r\nThese include the humanitarian questions that arise as a\r\nconsequence of natural disasters and armed conflicts, as\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\nwell as questions of refugee problems and globalization and\r\nits consequences.\r\nWith regard to humanitarian questions, we appreciate\r\nthe fact that the report dealt with the response to similar\r\nappeals by agencies. However, it is a cause of concern that\r\nthe response to those appeals represented only an estimated\r\n31.6 per cent of the financing for the needs of 1999 and\r\nwas subsequently rejected. While we appreciate the difficult\r\nsituation that made it inevitable to meet the humanitarian\r\nneeds in south-eastern Europe, this does not justify the\r\ndecline in assistance to other regions with urgent\r\nhumanitarian situations, particularly those in Africa. We\r\nshare the feelings of grief and sadness expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General with regard to the declining response to\r\ncrises in Africa. We hope that the response by the\r\ninternational community, and the donor community in\r\nparticular, will be based on equity and equality, and with no\r\ndiscrimination between one region and another, since the\r\nhumanitarian condition represents the common denominator\r\nof all regions.\r\nA continued selective and preferential approach in the\r\nlevel of response to one region or another, with regard to\r\nhumanitarian situations in the world, would only subject the\r\nconcept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention\r\nto humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the\r\ncredibility of the real motives and objectives. This has lead\r\nsome of us to fear that it was being carried out only to\r\nachieve the national or strategic interests of some countries.\r\nThe second question we would like to discuss in\r\nconnection with the report of the Secretary-General deals\r\nwith the provision of assistance to refugees. It is gratifying\r\nto note that, in contrast to previous years, 1998 and the\r\nbeginning of 1999 did not witness many flows of refugees\r\nor displacements of persons. In paragraph 215 of the report\r\nthere is reference to the fact that the majority of Ethiopian\r\nrefugees in the Sudan were able to return voluntarily to\r\ntheir homes in 1998.\r\nParagraph 214 refers to the fact that the armed conflict\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea led to new and large\r\ndisplacements of refugees in the Horn of Africa. In this\r\nconnection, we would like to refer to the initiative of the\r\nOAU to hold the first ministerial meeting in Khartoum last\r\nDecember to discuss the problem of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons. That meeting was attended by all\r\nMember States of the OAU, the United Nations and\r\nvolunteer organizations and agencies. The meeting\r\ndiscussed all facets of the problem in order to deal with its\r\nroot causes and to provide appropriate conditions for the\r\nreturn of refugees and displaced persons to their homes.\r\nThe ministerial meeting adopted a declaration and many\r\nrecommendations in the hope that the international\r\ncommunity would help to provide the necessary support\r\nto implement these recommendations and ultimately find\r\npermanent solutions to the problem.\r\nFinally, we would like to express our support for the\r\nideas expressed by the Secretary-General on the various\r\nchallenges caused by globalization. Individual States\r\ncannot face those challenges alone. The situation calls for\r\nmultilateral cooperation. We are fully convinced that the\r\nUnited Nations, as the most representative and democratic\r\nof international organizations, remains the international\r\nforum most qualified to deal with the effects of\r\nglobalization in the economic, social and environmental\r\nareas, as well as with questions of equality and fairness\r\nbetween the sexes.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): In his speech\r\nthe Secretary-General opened a Pandora\u0027s box full of\r\ncrucial questions, a courageous and timely gesture. He has\r\nopenly brought to the surface the already obvious clash\r\nbetween the principles of sovereignty and humanitarian\r\nintervention — a disturbing but unavoidable dilemma.\r\nIt is true that respect for sovereignty is an essential\r\nbasic principle in international relations. We all agree. It\r\nis no less a moral imperative — and a legal imperative —\r\nthat we react to massive and brutal violations of human\r\nrights. Many of us agree on this as well. Consequently, it\r\nwould seem obvious that when these two principles\r\ncollide — when there is a humanitarian catastrophe within\r\na State, for example — humanitarian intervention should\r\ncome under the legal umbrella — that is, it should not\r\ntake place on the fringe of international legality.\r\nIn other words, the so-called right of interference\r\nshould be authorized or supported by the Security\r\nCouncil; many of us would agree with this. But — and\r\nthis is the troubling issue raised by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s statement — what happens when the Security\r\nCouncil is paralysed, for one reason or another? Should\r\nthe international community be resigned, in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, to standing idly by in the face of a flagrant\r\natrocity caused by the use of the veto by one of its\r\nmembers? Should the collective indignation of humankind\r\nbe stifled by the scrupulous respect of the principle of\r\nsovereignty or by the obstructing will of a single country?\r\nCan the absolute and unfailing respect of sovereignty on\r\none hand, or the sometimes selfish will of a single Power\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 October 1999\r\non the other, silence the outcry of the international\r\ncommunity when it is inclined to take action?\r\nThese are questions of critical importance for\r\ninternational security, for the common interest of\r\nhumankind and, of course, for the very future of the\r\nUnited Nations. The Assembly should be able to find\r\nsolutions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
