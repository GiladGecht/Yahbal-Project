(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/54/250/Add.1)\r\nThe President: The second report of the General\r\nCommittee, document A/54/250/Add.1, concerns a request\r\nby a number of delegations for the inclusion in the agenda\r\nof an additional item, “Observer status for the community\r\nof Portuguese-Speaking countries in the General\r\nAssembly”; a request by the delegation of South Africa for\r\nthe inclusion of an additional sub-item under agenda item\r\n151, “Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing\r\nof the United Nations peacekeeping operations”; and a\r\nrequest by the Chairman of the Second Committee\r\nconcerning sub-item (a) of agenda item 101, “Operational\r\nactivities for development.”\r\nIn paragraph 1 of the report, the General Committee\r\ndecided to recommend to the General Assembly that an\r\nadditional item entitled “Observer status for the community\r\nof Portuguese-Speaking countries in the General Assembly”\r\nshould be included in the agenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\ninclude in the agenda of the current session this additional\r\nitem?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee further\r\ndecided to recommend to the General Assembly that the\r\nadditional item should be considered directly in plenary\r\nmeeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\nconsider this item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 2 of the report, the\r\nGeneral Committee decided to recommend to the General\r\nAssembly that an additional sub-item entitled\r\n“Reallocation of South Africa to the group of Member\r\nStates” set out in paragraph 3 (c) of General Assembly\r\nresolution 43/232” should be included as a sub-item of\r\nagenda item 151, “Administrative and budgetary aspects\r\nof the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\ninclude this additional item as a sub-item of agenda item\r\n151 in the agenda of the current session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee further\r\ndecided to recommend to the General Assembly that the\r\nadditional sub-item should be allocated to the Fifth\r\nCommittee.\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\nallocate the sub-item to the Fifth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The Chairman of the Fifth Committee\r\nwill be informed of the decision just taken.\r\nIn paragraph 3 of the report, the General Committee,\r\nhaving recalled that the General Assembly had allocated\r\nagenda item 101 and its sub-items to the Second\r\nCommittee, decided to recommend to the General Assembly\r\nthat sub-item (a), entitled “Operational activities for\r\ndevelopment of the United Nations system”, of agenda item\r\n101, “Operational activities for development”, also be\r\nconsidered directly in plenary meeting on the understanding\r\nthat only the topic entitled “Follow-up of the World\r\nSummit for Children” would be considered in the plenary.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly approves this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nDate of the commemoration of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild\r\nThe President: In connection with agenda item 165,\r\nmembers will recall that the General Assembly, at its 3rd\r\nplenary meeting, on 17 September 1999, decided to hold\r\nthe Commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on Monday, 15\r\nNovember 1999, in the morning. Members will further\r\nrecall that this date was suggested by the Member States\r\nthat sponsored the inclusion of agenda item 165. After\r\nconsultations with those Member States, I should like to\r\npropose that the Commemoration be held on Thursday, 11\r\nNovember 1999, in the morning, instead of Monday, 15\r\nNovember.\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/54/1)\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in French):\r\nAs I was getting up from my seat to come up here to\r\nspeak, I was looking at you, Mr. President, and an image\r\ncame back to me of the first time we met, some 24 years\r\nago. It was in Dakar, at the International Conference on\r\nNamibia and Human Rights. At that time you were the\r\nrepresentative of the South West Africa People\u0027s\r\nOrganization. Now, as I see you there in the Chair, I\r\ncannot help telling you how extraordinarily happy I am to\r\nsee you presiding over our work.\r\nI would also like to confirm to the Secretary-General\r\nour great appreciation for his action and his commitment\r\nwherever our Organization is called upon. We commend\r\nhim warmly for his excellent report, which is now before\r\nus. It describes the decisive and unavoidable role that the\r\nUnited Nations must always play in strengthening the\r\ninternational community and in increasingly mobilizing it\r\nto take up the major challenges confronting humanity at\r\nthe end of this century.\r\nBeginning a new century — even more, beginning\r\na new millennium — gives rise to fears and doubts\r\namong human beings. In general fears of the unknown\r\nand uncertainty about what will happen in the future are\r\nheightened by the change and upheaval characteristic of\r\ntransitional periods. However, the times in which we are\r\nliving are particularly suited to creating such anxieties.\r\nThere is certainly no lack of grounds for concern at\r\nthe political, economic and social levels. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report thoroughly reviews these challenges,\r\nwhile also describing the efforts the United Nations and\r\nthe international community have made to cope with\r\nthem. Above all he proposes new directions for more\r\nvigorous and resolute action.\r\nThe first and foremost source of concern is, without\r\ndoubt, the increase in armed conflicts which has recently\r\nbeen observed. From the Horn of Africa to the Middle\r\nEast, from West Africa to Central Africa, from\r\nAfghanistan to Chechnya, from East Timor to Kosovo,\r\nthe number of confrontations is proliferating — and with\r\nthem come suffering, victims and destruction.\r\nThe very nature of armed conflict has also changed.\r\nMore than 90 per cent of the conflicts do not pit State\r\nagainst State, but are rather intra-State conflicts, involving\r\nlocal armed groups, factions, militias and even ethnic\r\ngroups. Moreover, the conflicts are lasting longer and\r\nhave become more deadly. What is even more disturbing\r\nis the increasing targeting of civilians, who now make up\r\nmost of the victims. The figures are not only telling; they\r\nmake one shudder. The proportion of the victims of\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\narmed conflicts who are civilians has changed from 5 per\r\ncent during the First World War to 90 per cent today.\r\nCertainly the international community must respond in a\r\ndetermined manner to the increase in killing and to the\r\ndisturbing trend of flouting the most fundamental rights of\r\nhuman beings. In this connection, the recent establishment\r\nof the International Criminal Court, which is an important\r\nstep forward in the struggle to combat impunity at the\r\nglobal level, is truly promising.\r\nPreventive diplomacy, as the Secretary-General\r\nrecognizes, is an essential aspect of the struggle to control\r\nthe proliferation of armed conflicts. It deserves special\r\nattention, and the necessary implementation mechanisms are\r\nwell known. They are mediation, negotiation, early warning\r\nand preventive deployment and disarmament.\r\nHere let us pay tribute to the mediation efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General and his special envoys to defuse tensions\r\nin several hot spots. We should also commend the\r\nachievements of various facilitators and mediators, whose\r\neffective and discreet work is often unknown to the general\r\npublic.\r\nNonetheless, most conflicts and crises continue to\r\ncatch the international community unawares. This\r\ndemonstrates the need to further refine preventive\r\nmechanisms at the global as well as at subregional levels so\r\nthat the first signs of conflicts can be recognized and\r\nconflicts can truly be nipped in the bud. More than ever\r\nbefore it is important that the international community react\r\nin a timely fashion, rather than waiting for situations to\r\ndegenerate. To be truly effective, preventive diplomacy\r\nmust integrate these two dimensions.\r\nMore than any other continent, Africa is being\r\ntragically torn apart by deadly conflicts. Be they inter-State\r\nor inter-ethnic, all these conflicts involve heavy losses of\r\nhuman life and devastating consequences for the economic\r\nand social development of the countries involved. In\r\nparticular, the recurrent security problems of Central Africa\r\nare of serious concern to Cameroon.\r\nIn this connection we commend the excellent efforts\r\nmade by the United Nations and local actors to achieve\r\npeace in the region. These efforts reflect the hopes of\r\nthousands of civilians, refugees and displaced persons who\r\nhave been caught up in these confrontations while often not\r\nunderstanding why they are occurring.\r\nPeace and security are the necessary and indispensable\r\nconditions for development and progress. Therefore we\r\nmust at all costs put an end to the wars in Africa, and in\r\nCentral Africa in particular. It is in this spirit that\r\nCameroon is actively involved in implementing the\r\nobjectives that the States of our subregion have set for\r\nthemselves within the context of the United Nations\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\r\nCentral Africa. It has become clear that this Committee\r\nhas provided the best framework for dialogue in Central\r\nAfrica as the region seeks to establish its security.\r\nThe efforts have already led to the signing of a non-\r\naggression pact and to the recent creation of the Council\r\nfor Peace and Security in Central Africa, known as\r\nCOPAX. They have also led to the creation of an early-\r\nwarning mechanism. Other structures are also going to be\r\nset up. These will be a subregional parliament, a\r\nsubregional centre for human rights and democracy, and\r\na Central African court of justice. All these structures\r\nbear witness to the concern of the leaders of the region to\r\nforever distance their peoples from the horrors of war.\r\nThis shared resolve of the leaders of Central Africa\r\nto build peace was also demonstrated by the organization\r\nin Yaoundé of a high-level seminar on the implementation\r\nin Central Africa of the recommendations made in the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report on the causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Along the same lines, a\r\nsubregional conference on the proliferation and illicit\r\ntrade in light weapons and small arms will take place in\r\nN\u0027Djamena from 25 to 27 October. This conference will\r\nallow the countries of the subregion to consider ways and\r\nmeans of fighting this scourge, a harbinger of ongoing\r\ninsecurity and instability that jeopardizes these countries\u0027\r\nefforts towards development.\r\nCameroon urges the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community to increase their sorely needed\r\nassistance to the implementation and functioning of the\r\nmechanisms created by these means. These mechanisms\r\nare crucibles of the hope and legitimate aspirations of the\r\npeoples of a region beset by wars and recurring crises.\r\nLike the Consultative Committee in Central Africa,\r\nregional organizations are playing an ever more important\r\nrole in peacemaking by establishing mechanisms to\r\nprevent and manage conflicts and to maintain and restore\r\npeace. As necessary and useful as it may be, the work of\r\nregional organization to prevent or stop conflicts must\r\nnevertheless be carried out in full respect of international\r\nlegality and in particular of the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter. These principles must remain the focus\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nof efforts and initiatives in support of peace if our work is\r\nto avoid losing its direction and all its legitimacy.\r\nOf course, the international community cannot\r\npossibly stand aside yet again to watch, impotent,\r\nindifferent or hesitant, as it regrettably did in Rwanda, as\r\ngenocide or any other mass human rights violation unfolds.\r\nHowever, the United Nations Charter must in all cases\r\nguide the action to be taken. As the Secretary-General says\r\nin his report, only the Charter provides a universally\r\naccepted legal basis for the use of force. It is the Charter\r\nalone that allows the need to guarantee state sovereignty\r\nand non-interference in internal affairs to be reconciled with\r\nthe need collectively to build a better world of peace,\r\njustice and freedom for all. The Secretary-General\u0027s report\r\nand his opening statement to this session had the merit of\r\ninitiating a debate that must be continued.\r\nThe responses of the international community to crises\r\nand their humanitarian repercussions cannot be\r\npredetermined. Indeed, crises are not all identical. Thus,\r\nStates must determine appropriate rules of conduct and\r\nparameters reflecting the necessary balance between the\r\nspecific features of each crisis and the need to act. The\r\ninternational community must also use greater subtlety in\r\ndrafting or implementing certain decisions to settle crisis or\r\nconflict situations. Thus, we must always take care to avoid\r\nunnecessary suffering for civilian populations when we\r\nimplement or impose embargoes.\r\nThe international community should be moved with\r\nthe same resolve by the humanitarian disasters that follow\r\nincreasingly upon armed conflicts, wherever they may take\r\nplace. The relative indifference and reluctance of the\r\ninternational community to mobilize to address\r\nhumanitarian catastrophes or conflicts occurring in Africa\r\nare difficult to understand, especially at a time when the\r\nglobal village is becoming ever more real and when the\r\nsense of solidarity that humanity will need successfully to\r\ntake up the challenges of the third millennium should be\r\nasserting itself more than ever.\r\nThe ways such solidarity can be implemented are\r\nvaried. It is no less true that the way in which it is\r\nexpressed will largely determine the world\u0027s stability in the\r\ntwenty-first century. The promotion of economic and social\r\ndevelopment — which, as everyone knows, is a guarantor\r\nof peace and security throughout the world — must be one\r\nof the central areas in which this solidarity is expressed.\r\nIndeed, it is the area par excellence in which international\r\nsolidarity must be manifest. We can never say it too often:\r\nif it is to be effective and truly to bear fruit, this solidarity\r\nmust involve the maintenance and increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, fair remuneration for the\r\ncommodities on which our economies are based, and debt\r\nalleviation.\r\nIn this context, we must also give more balanced\r\nattention to our consideration of the special situation of\r\nmedium-income countries, whose efforts should be\r\nencouraged that they may emerge and become more\r\ncompetitive. This will require, inter alia, that such\r\ncountries benefit from a bare minimal ease of access to\r\nthe resources of the international financial institutions, of\r\ncourse without prejudice to the support that must be lent\r\nto the least developed developing countries.\r\nThe United Nations is the foremost crucible and\r\nshowcase of international cooperation and solidarity. As\r\nsuch, it embodies the fundamental and existential hopes\r\nof the peoples of the world to see the twenty-first century\r\nand the third millennium be consecrated to general peace\r\nand fairly apportioned prosperity. Let us therefore not\r\nstint in our support of the Organization.\r\nCameroon has consistently asserted its devotion to\r\nthe goals and principles that underpin the United Nations\r\nand its support for the work of the Secretary-General. On\r\nbehalf of Cameroon, I wish once again to reiterate hic et\r\nnunc that commitment and support.\r\nMr. Chaouachi (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Tunisia\r\nthanks the Secretary-General for his thorough report on\r\nthe work of the Organization over the past year. My\r\ndelegation, which has studied the report closely, also\r\nfollowed with interest the statement by Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nto the General Assembly on 20 September 1999, when he\r\npresented his annual report and a number of new\r\nproposals and concepts.\r\nTunisia fully shares the views of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the need to replace a culture of reaction with\r\na culture of prevention, as it is true that prevention is\r\nbetter than cure, and that prevention is ultimately less\r\ncostly in human lives and precious resources. The\r\ninstruments of preventive diplomacy, including early\r\nwarning, post-conflict peace-building and preventive\r\ndeployment, are among the means available to the\r\ninternational community to deal with conflict or pre-\r\nconflict situations that threaten peace and security and\r\nplace civilian populations at risk.\r\nIt is also true that humanitarian challenges have now\r\ntaken on particularly serious dimensions. These are major\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nchallenges which undeniably must be met. We also endorse\r\nthe assessment on this matter of the Secretary-General,\r\nwhom we support in his appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to set up better prevention strategies.\r\nIn our view, these strategies should be shaped by\r\ncertain central concerns, including dealing with the root\r\ncauses of outbreaks of violence in certain regions of the\r\nworld, from which stems the need to promote and\r\naccelerate economic and social development. Poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment threaten major segments of the\r\npopulation throughout the world. In his report the\r\nSecretary-General rightly notes that over the past decade\r\nofficial development assistance has been declining. The 0.7\r\nper cent of gross national product of developed countries\r\nset by the international community as the official\r\ndevelopment assistance goal has not yet been achieved.\r\nThere is certainly a need to renew efforts in the\r\nframework of international economic cooperation to speed\r\nup the pace of development in the countries of the South\r\nand to meet the challenge of poverty, whose image\r\nbecomes less and less tolerable given the enormous\r\nprogress achieved at the end of the twentieth century.\r\nWith regard to the concept of what is known as\r\nhumanitarian intervention, I would like to reiterate the\r\ncomments made by the Foreign Minister of my country\r\nduring the general debate. He emphasized that this is a\r\ndelicate and sensitive issue which requires in-depth\r\nconsideration, account being taken of two essential aspects:\r\nfirst, the sovereignty of States and the need to preserve it\r\nas a natural right enshrined in the United Nations Charter\r\nand as a basic element of international relations; secondly,\r\nthe need to give assistance to civilian populations during\r\narmed conflicts by applying the principle of international\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe Tunisian Minister also invited Member States to\r\ncarefully consider all the dimensions of this issue, in order\r\nto arrive at a consensus through a well considered, calm\r\ndebate. Finally, Tunisia, through its Minister, stressed the\r\nimportance of having this debate take place within both the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. Today we\r\nreiterate those observations. We are ready to participate in\r\nany mechanism established by the Assembly for this\r\npurpose. It is essential that the debate take place in a calm\r\nand clear atmosphere and that its outcome reflect a true\r\nconsensus and not a relationship of force, real or perceived,\r\nwhich would in no way serve the noble objectives we are\r\npursuing.\r\nBefore concluding this statement, which is\r\nnecessarily short as compared to the diversity and the\r\nnumber of issues taken up by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport, I would like to refer to the question of sanctions\r\nto highlight the interest which should be accorded to the\r\nongoing improvement and refinement of their use as a\r\ntool in the service of international peace and security. In\r\nthis framework, particular importance should be placed on\r\nkeeping the use of sanctions for a last resort, after all\r\nother peaceful means have been exhausted, limiting their\r\ntime-frame and lessening their impact on civilian\r\npopulations and neighbouring countries.\r\nMr. Benítez Sáenz (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report (A/54/1) on\r\nthe work of the Organization.\r\nLike many other delegations whose representatives\r\nhave already spoken on this item, we wish to highlight\r\nthe special significance we attach to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s statement on 20 September to the General\r\nAssembly, which we see as being closely linked to the\r\nwork of the Organization and its future.\r\nWe wish to refer to the question of armed\r\nintervention for humanitarian purposes outside the limits\r\nin the Charter and its impact on the sovereignty of States.\r\nHowever it is regarded, this is the burning issue currently\r\nbefore the Organization. On its correct resolution,\r\nrespectful of international law, depends our future.\r\nWith good reason, the Secretary-General presented\r\nus in his statement with a series of questions promoting\r\nthe Organization\u0027s restoration to its rightful place in\r\ninternational relations. The task before us is the\r\nresponsibility of all Member States. Whether it is dealt\r\nwith through analysis in existing working groups or in a\r\nnew working group to be established, the matter should\r\nbe discussed with transparency and universality,\r\nrespecting the existing provisions of the Charter.\r\nIn much of his report the Secretary-General also\r\nraises many points regarding the lessons learned from the\r\nKosovo conflict, which we believe are closely related to\r\nthe problem. We fully share his assessment that the\r\ninternational community has no other universally accepted\r\nlegal basis for responding to unjustifiable acts of violence\r\nbut this Organization, the United Nations. It is within this\r\nOrganization that we must overcome political limitations\r\nto be able to take action within the framework of the\r\nCharter. It is essential for regional security organizations\r\nto have the proper mandate from the Security Council.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nWhile my delegation believes that the political\r\nmessage given to us by the Secretary-General is what\r\ndeserves our greatest attention, we would like very briefly\r\nto highlight and comment specifically on a few points\r\ncontained in the report. First, we see that no practical,\r\nequitable and reasonable solution has yet been found to\r\nrespond to the concerns of third States affected by sanctions\r\nimposed by the Security Council. The principle of the\r\nresponsibility of whoever adopts a measure has not yet\r\nbeen properly expressed, and there are States that are\r\nunjustly harmed, and they must be compensated.\r\nIn the area of peacekeeping operations, the\r\nOrganization has been making important achievements with\r\na new multidimensional operational approach. Here it is\r\nnecessary to recall once again that the arrears of some\r\nMember States, which add up to more than $900 million,\r\nendangers the effectiveness of the system.\r\nFinally, we encourage the further development of\r\nelectoral assistance programmes, since we believe that such\r\ncooperation by the international community leads to the\r\nestablishment and consolidation of national democracies.\r\nMr. Ibrahim (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): First of all,\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for his annual\r\nreport on the work of the Organization. We pay tribute to\r\nhim for his constant efforts to strengthen the Organization\r\nin all areas.\r\nIn contrast to the usual descriptive reports, this report\r\nthe Secretary-General has taken a very progressive\r\napproach. He has voiced views and set forth valuable\r\npositions to be carefully studied. The full participation of\r\ndelegations in considering the report bears witness to the\r\nimportance of the issues raised by the Secretary-General\r\nand the validity of his perceptive insights, despite the\r\ndiffering views regarding them.\r\nBy studying the report of the Secretary-General, we\r\ncan see that he has described the successes, as well as the\r\nfailures, of the Organization in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, cooperation for\r\ndevelopment and in the humanitarian and other areas. This\r\nstrengthens our belief that the United Nations can continue\r\nto play a significant role in promoting the well-being and\r\nsecurity of the human race, in enhancing stability and in\r\nfurtherance of its purposes and principles as enshrined in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nSince all peoples and nations of the world believe in\r\nthe efficient role of the United Nations and attach great\r\nimportance to the continuation of this role, we must take\r\nnecessary positive steps to reform the Organization. I\r\nwould like to quote my country\u0027s Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Mr. Abdul-Qader Ba-Jammal, who addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 30 September:\r\n“Since one of our primary goals is the\r\nreform of the United Nations and, in particular,\r\nthe Security Council and the international\r\ninstitutions, we are giving this goal our full\r\nattention and support. At the same time, we\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for the\r\ninitiatives and measures he has taken towards\r\nthe goal of reforming the United Nations, its\r\nmechanisms and its methods of work, which\r\nwould broaden democratic practices and\r\nachieve transparency of work and effectiveness\r\nof participation”. (A/54/PV.19)\r\nThe Secretary-General also spoke about humanitarian\r\nintervention, which has been very controversial. Some\r\nhave supported this concept; others have opposed it. In\r\nthis connection, the Republic of Yemen firmly believes\r\nthat it is important to protect human rights. We are\r\ncommitted to democratic practices in order to ensure\r\nintegrated development, and we welcome the interest\r\nshown by the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity in the area of human rights. We must put an\r\nend to flagrant violations of human rights and to crimes\r\nagainst humanity that are perpetrated throughout the\r\nworld. The international community cannot just sit back\r\nand watch violations of human rights and genocide\r\nwithout doing anything — whether genocide is committed\r\non the basis of religion or of ethnic background.\r\nHowever, we believe that the decision to intervene on\r\nhumanitarian grounds should be taken only after all\r\npeaceful methods have been exhausted. Preventive\r\ndiplomacy can be very important here. In any event,\r\nintervention should be carried out in accordance with the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and on the basis of partnership,\r\ntransparency and democracy. It should not be selective or\r\nbased on a policy of double standards, a policy that the\r\nSecretary-General has warned against.\r\nThe principle of State sovereignty is a well-\r\nestablished principle in international relations. We cannot\r\naccept the notion that this principle is outmoded and has\r\nbeen superseded by international developments, so we\r\nsupport the Egyptian proposal to study this matter within\r\nthe framework of the General Assembly.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nAs regards participation in globalization, it is natural\r\nthat the poor and developing countries worry about\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization. Most States whose\r\neconomies are vulnerable cannot find their place in the new\r\neconomic order. However, they cannot halt progress. So we\r\nhave to define a new, objective policy and achieve\r\ninternational cooperation. The responsibility here is a\r\ncollective one. The developing countries themselves must\r\nreform their own economic and financial systems. In\r\ncontrast, the developed countries must provide assistance\r\nand support to the developing countries so they can achieve\r\nsuch reform. Globalization must have a human face. We\r\ncannot aspire to a better world if globalization means that\r\nthe rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\r\nMr. Pohan (Indonesia): The Indonesian delegation has\r\nnoted with interest the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe work of the Organization (A/54/1), as well as his\r\nstatement introducing the report. Taken together, they offer\r\na comprehensive account of the functioning of our\r\nOrganization and contain numerous proposals and\r\napproaches which warrant our careful and cautious\r\nconsideration. We agree with the objective of strengthening\r\nthe Organization in all fields, including the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security since, as the report\r\nhighlights in paragraph 36, “there is no higher goal, no\r\ndeeper commitment ... than preventing armed conflict.”\r\nThe report also rightly focuses attention on economic\r\nand social issues which have long been sidelined. These\r\nhave become all the more important today as conflicts are\r\nincreasingly recognized to have socio-economic origins. As\r\nthe Organization stands poised on the eve of a new\r\nmillennium to assume the challenges of the future, its\r\nprimary mission will be to convey to the world a renewed\r\nvision and to fulfil its commitment to development as the\r\nbest means to root out the fundamental causes of conflicts\r\nwhich pose threats to international peace and security.\r\nIn this context, the report points out that decision-\r\nmaking is often paralysed by differences among the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. It is\r\nparadoxical that while the Council is venturing into new\r\nareas which are within the purview of other United Nations\r\norgans and bodies, it is being squeezed out of its role in the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security. Its role is being\r\nundermined when regional security organizations undertake\r\nenforcement actions without the Council\u0027s authorization.\r\nThese are dangerous tendencies which could lead to future\r\ninterventions without the consent of the States involved,\r\nand hence are unacceptable. The experience of the United\r\nNations in peace enforcement or intervention has proved\r\nthat either outcomes are uncertain or the course of action\r\nis dangerous. In situations where the decisions taken by\r\nthe Security Council did not require the consent of the\r\nparties involved, they led to a loss of neutrality that\r\nexposed the United Nations to charges of violating\r\nnational sovereignty. These situations were further\r\naggravated by differences among the permanent members\r\nof the Council in dealing with conflicts when the parties\r\ninvolved were committed to a peaceful settlement.\r\nIntervention requires international consensus concerning\r\npolicies, mandates and resources.\r\nIntervention also has unacceptable implications for\r\nnational sovereignty. These are rooted in the undemocratic\r\nand unrepresentative character of the Security Council,\r\nwhich does not inspire confidence in its impartiality and\r\nobjectivity. Hence, we must remain vigilant against a\r\ngrowing trend to chip away at the sacrosanct principle of\r\nnational sovereignty, one of the principles on which the\r\nUnited Nations itself was founded. It is the only defence\r\nagainst injustice in relations between strong and weak\r\nnations. To blame this principle for the inability of the\r\nOrganization to come to the aid of suffering humanity\r\nanywhere is to distort the truth. To extend such assistance\r\nis a solemn obligation. Indeed, it is imperative. However,\r\nthere are many reasons why the United Nations often\r\nfinds itself ineffective in situations that require it to act\r\nswiftly and decisively. These include resource constraints,\r\nlack of political will, selectivity, misplaced media\r\nattention and dysfunction in the working of such bodies\r\nas the Security Council and in the implementing\r\nmechanisms. These have nothing to do with the principle\r\nof sovereignty. We must uphold this principle, for without\r\nit, the United Nations cannot stand, and small, weak\r\nnations will be cast down at the mercy of the big and the\r\nstrong. Respect for sovereignty, which the United Nations\r\nsystem requires, is not an idle stipulation that can be\r\nrejected even for noble gestures, and an essential attribute\r\nof that sovereignty is the principle of consent, one of the\r\ncornerstones of the democratic ideal.\r\nMy delegation attaches particular importance to the\r\nissue of peacekeeping operations, which, as the report\r\nnotes, faces major new challenges and complexities. It is\r\nto be noted that most peacekeeping operations are in\r\ndeveloping countries and that many of the troop\r\ncontributors are also from those nations. Peacekeeping\r\nforces must necessarily function on the basis of\r\nimpartiality and the use of force in self-defence. If United\r\nNations forces are seen as partisan, they will not enjoy\r\nthe support of all parties to the conflict. Without such\r\nsupport, they would be cast in the role of belligerents.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nThis would also mean increased cost to the United Nations\r\nin terms of men and materials. Considering some recent\r\nsuccesses and setbacks in peacekeeping operations, and\r\ntaking into account the fact that such activities have moved\r\nbeyond the traditional concept to a multidimensional one,\r\nthere is an urgent need to review, to take stock of and to\r\ndraw conclusions from recent experiences.\r\nIndonesia agrees with the Secretary-General\u0027s view\r\nthat “The systematic and progressive reduction of nuclear\r\nweapons, with the ultimate goal of their complete\r\nelimination, will remain one of the priority tasks of the\r\ninternational community.” (ibid., para. 119)\r\nIn this regard, it is essential to reaffirm the issues of\r\nnon-use of nuclear weapons, the prevention of nuclear war\r\nand the elimination of all nuclear weapons, and the priority\r\nof these issues in disarmament negotiations under\r\nmultilateral auspices, which continue to be a preoccupation\r\nof the international community.\r\nThe report also touches upon the question of sanctions\r\nand calls for selective targeting in order to reduce the\r\nhumanitarian costs to the civilian population. Many critical\r\nissues need to be clarified prior to the imposition of\r\nsanctions, especially their short-term and long-term effects\r\non the country targeted and the collateral damage suffered\r\nby third parties. Sanctions should be terminated after their\r\nobjectives are achieved. Such an approach would strengthen\r\ninternational support for the imposition and implementation\r\nof sanctions regimes.\r\nWith regard to the role of regional organizations in\r\nconflict situations, the Secretary-General has drawn our\r\nattention to the unique capabilities of the United Nations\r\nsystem in coordinating actions in multifaceted operations.\r\nIn this context, we welcome close cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and various regional organizations,\r\narrangements and agencies so that they can be mutually\r\nreinforcing and complementary. But it should also be\r\nrecognized that they have their charters and specific\r\nmandates and competences. Hence, such cooperation should\r\nbe carried out on the basis of coordination and consultation.\r\nThis calls for a thorough exploration of possible procedures\r\nand mechanisms that would strengthen interaction between\r\nthem.\r\nWhile acknowledging that post-conflict peace-building\r\nis a new and evolving concept, my delegation\r\nacknowledges the usefulness of the holistic approach\r\nencompassing diverse activities. It is appropriate that such\r\nactivities be undertaken on the basis of agreements ending\r\nconflicts or reached after conflicts have ended.\r\nInternational peace and security are indispensable for\r\nthe economic well-being of all peoples. Stability will be\r\npossible only if the international community addresses the\r\nunderlying socio-economic causes of instability. In this\r\ncontext, the United Nations can and should play a central\r\nrole in overcoming the economic problems caused\r\nespecially by the forces of globalization and liberalization.\r\nIn recognition of the indivisibility of peace and prosperity,\r\nthe revitalization of a global developmental strategy and\r\nthe eradication of poverty should be priority goals for the\r\nUnited Nations. This could be brought about by a greater\r\ncommitment to multilateral development cooperation.\r\nMost important of all, there can be real peace and\r\ndevelopment only if there are substantive changes and\r\nreforms of the global economic and financial systems so\r\nthat the developing countries can have a fair chance of\r\nachieving social and economic development for their\r\npeoples.\r\nLet me conclude by drawing attention to various\r\nproposals, including those advanced by Egypt and\r\nMexico, for a follow-up of the ideas and approaches\r\nintroduced by the Secretary-General, both in his report\r\nand in his statement of 20 September to the General\r\nAssembly. These proposals warrant our serious study and\r\nscrutiny, with a view to a role for the General Assembly\r\nin accordance with the Charter.\r\nMr. Akinsanya (Nigeria): Although the head of the\r\nNigerian delegation to the General Assembly at its current\r\nsession, His Excellency President Olusegun Obasanjo, has\r\nhad the opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fourth session, I cannot pass up this unique\r\nopportunity to restate my personal delight at seeing you,\r\na son of Africa, in the Chair. As one who has had the\r\nprivilege of seeing you at work, in both bilateral and\r\nmultilateral forums since 1981 — when I first met you in\r\nGeneva, during the United Nations conference on\r\nNamibia — I am confident that your rich experience and\r\nstatesmanship will see us through a very successful\r\nsession.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation would like to express deep\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his excellent\r\nreport on the work of our Organization (A/54/1). Like the\r\ndelegations that have spoken before me, we found the\r\nreport very comprehensive, as it touches on all the issues\r\nof concern to the international community.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nOn the eve of a new millennium, Member States of\r\nthe United Nations have to cooperate in all areas of human\r\nendeavour to usher in a new world order devoid of\r\nignorance, poverty, war and disease. The international\r\ncommunity has to rededicate itself to the eradication of\r\nthese vices, using every available means. In this context, we\r\nshould serve notice of our rejection of breaches of the right\r\nof the individual wherever they might occur. We believe\r\nthat the object of Governments must remain the promotion\r\nand protection of the rights and welfare of individual\r\ncitizens, and not trampling on them. My delegation believes\r\nthat the international community must resolve to match its\r\nwords with deeds, as this is the only way that the impact of\r\nour Organization can be felt by ordinary people.\r\nIn this context, the concept of humanitarian\r\nintervention clearly requires careful study. While we uphold\r\nthe concept of sovereignty, we have to recognize that States\r\ncan no longer shield violations of the rights of their citizens\r\nunder the cloak of sovereignty. It would appear that some\r\nconsensus is emerging on the need for international action\r\nin cases involving gross violations of human and peoples\u0027\r\nrights. It is our belief, however, that in all cases\r\nintervention has to be carried out under a clearly defined\r\nand acceptable framework.\r\nIt is now a fact that national frontiers are becoming\r\nblurred. No nation can afford to remain untouched by\r\ndevelopments outside its borders. In no area has this been\r\nmore clearly demonstrated than in the sphere of\r\nglobalization. The consequences of globalization can\r\ntherefore be most effectively tackled only in the context of\r\nconcerted international action by individuals, organizations\r\nand Governments. We therefore endorse and welcome the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s views in this regard. The plan of action\r\ndrawn up by the United Nations Development Group\r\ncovering four broad areas of activities, as enumerated in the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report, can be realized only if States\r\nand organizations cooperate with each other and work in\r\nunison to mitigate the negative effects of globalization,\r\nwhich, my delegation also believes, should wear a human\r\nface.\r\nAs we take measures to address the problems of\r\neconomic development and poverty eradication in our\r\nvarious countries, my delegation believes that our efforts in\r\nthis regard require a favourable international environment\r\nfor them to succeed. The questions of external debt, net\r\ncapital flows — in terms of foreign direct investment and\r\nofficial development assistance — and market access for\r\nproducts from developing countries remain crucial,\r\nparticularly in this era of globalization.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation welcomes, and in fact\r\nshares, the Secretary-General\u0027s concerns about preventive\r\ndiplomacy and peacemaking as genuine tools for\r\nachieving lasting international peace and security. It is the\r\nview of my delegation that Member States have to\r\ndemonstrate strong political will as well as greater\r\ncommitment to providing adequate financial and material\r\nresources if the objectives of preventive diplomacy are to\r\nbe realized. Ultimately, preventive diplomacy is more\r\ncost-effective, both in terms of saving lives and scarce\r\nmaterial resources, than action taken after the eruption of\r\nconflicts. From our experience in our subregion within the\r\nframework of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), we are beginning to explore ways and\r\nmeans of strengthening preventive diplomacy, as was\r\nrecently demonstrated by the manner in which we swiftly\r\nmoved to address certain difficulties in relations between\r\nsome member States of our subregional organization.\r\nIt is the desire of all peace-loving people to see a\r\nworld devoid of war and strife. We have no option but to\r\ncontinue to intensify our actions in this important area of\r\nconflict prevention, peacemaking and peace-building. In\r\naddition, post-conflict peace-building and rehabilitation\r\nmeasures must be intensified for the achievement of\r\nenduring peace. In this regard, the plight of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, especially in Africa, has to be urgently\r\naddressed.\r\nWhile we in Africa are conscious of the imperative\r\nneed to take measures on our own to address the crises\r\nfacing our continent — and we have in fact been doing\r\nso — our efforts can yield the desired results only if they\r\nare supported and complemented by the international\r\ncommunity. But, unfortunately, these complementary\r\nefforts have not always been forthcoming, and even when\r\nthey are, the quantum of support falls short of\r\nexpectations in view of international responses to similar\r\nsituations in other parts of the world. This attitude must\r\nchange, in the true spirit of partnership and a globalizing\r\nworld.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation endorses the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s comments on disarmament and international\r\nsecurity and wishes to reaffirm its commitment to global\r\nefforts at nuclear disarmament and, particularly, at\r\nratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and\r\nthe anti-personnel landmines Convention. We also share\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s views on how the proliferation of\r\nsmall arms has contributed to the escalation of conflicts\r\nin developing countries, particularly in Africa. We\r\ntherefore join other delegations in calling for controls on\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nthe movement of these deadly weapons of war that have\r\ncontinued to kill and maim our citizens.\r\nOn the issue of United Nations reform, the Nigerian\r\ndelegation is of the view that it should no longer be\r\ndelayed. The structures and working processes of our\r\nOrganization have to be democratized. The United Nations\r\ncannot afford to be an umpire urging democratic reforms in\r\nMember States while its own structures are devoid of\r\ndemocratic values. Africa has to be given adequate\r\nrepresentation, especially among the permanent membership\r\nof the Security Council. In this regard, we would like to\r\necho the call made by our President, Mr. Olusegun\r\nObasanjo, when he addressed this body on 23 September\r\n1999 and urged the General Assembly to conclude\r\ndeliberations during its current session on the modalities for\r\nthe reform and expansion of the Security Council, for\r\nadoption by the Millennium Assembly next year.\r\nIt is the view of my delegation that the reform being\r\nadvocated is not meant to weaken the United Nations but\r\nto strengthen the Charter in order to enable the\r\nOrganization to meet the challenges posed by new realities.\r\nThese reforms have to be effected if our Organization is to\r\nmeet the challenges of the next millennium.\r\nTouching on another issue, the Nigerian Government\r\nhas always supported and will continue to support any\r\neffort that would improve the financial position of the\r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations rightly deserves to\r\nhave a strong financial base in order for the Organization\r\nto carry out its wide-ranging obligations. It is therefore\r\nimperative for Member States to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions in full and on time.\r\nMr. Belfort (Haiti) (spoke in French): The delegation\r\nof Haiti was pleased to read the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization, which clearly\r\nshows a concern to prepare the Organization to meet the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century successfully.\r\nAs the report underscores, the main challenge facing\r\nthe international community will be of a humanitarian\r\nnature, not only at the level of international security but\r\nalso with respect to measures aimed at eliminating poverty\r\nand the negative effects of globalization on the environment\r\nor on the social and economic structure of small States or\r\ndeveloping countries. Meeting such a challenge will be a\r\nmajor undertaking for the Organization, especially given the\r\nfact that, in the view of many of the representatives who\r\nhave spoken in this forum, humanitarian assistance and\r\ninternational human rights policies are often inconsistent\r\nwith the principle of the sovereignty of States, which is\r\nthe cornerstone of the current system of international\r\nrelations.\r\nIt is an important question, because it gives rise to\r\nlegitimate concerns. However, in no way should it be\r\nseen, from the perspective of a misconceived post-\r\nmodernism, as a pretext for pitting the concept of\r\nsovereignty against that of human rights. There can be no\r\nambiguity in this respect. The universal character of\r\nhuman rights and their corollary, the humanitarian\r\nchallenge, must be retained and strengthened in strict\r\naccordance with the Charter governing our Organization,\r\nin order to eliminate any ambiguities relating to the\r\nconcept of humanitarian intervention.\r\nMy delegation took careful note of the comment\r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his report that elections\r\nare a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creating\r\nviable and lasting democracies. But establishing or\r\nstrengthening administrative infrastructures is not enough\r\neither to contribute decisively to the promotion of\r\nsustainable new democracies. It is therefore imperative to\r\ntake into account basic economic parameters.\r\nIn this context, we take this opportunity to welcome\r\nonce again the initiative taken by Ambassador Paolo Fulci\r\nfor the revitalization of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe role and the importance of this United Nations organ\r\nhave been underplayed for far too long. On the eve of the\r\nthird millennium, it is up to all Members of the\r\nOrganization to contribute to enabling that body once\r\nagain to assume its full role in order to assist the\r\nSecretary-General in building and promoting a culture of\r\nprevention, with a view to meeting successfully the\r\nhumanitarian challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nMy delegation has also noted that in his report the\r\nSecretary-General underscores the fact that the challenges\r\nof development and poverty eradication can be met only\r\nthrough well-planned, coordinated and adequately funded\r\ninternational action. Since the United Nations is uniquely\r\nand favourably positioned to carry out this task, it is\r\nimportant to effect the necessary reform of the\r\nOrganization as soon as possible, be it in the context of\r\nequitable representation on the Security Council or of\r\nstrengthening the administrative efficiency of the\r\nOrganization, while avoiding any unnecessary expense\r\nand taking the measures needed to prevent any overlap of\r\nthe activities of various United Nations bodies.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nIn order to meet the political, social and economic\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, it is important to\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations, which offers a\r\nmultilateral global framework for identifying problems and\r\njointly resolving them.\r\nThe next session of the General Assembly will be the\r\nMillennium Assembly, and a key question for this body is\r\ndeciding on its focus. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his\r\nstatement of 20 September, implied that the focus could be\r\non the concept of the humanitarian challenge. That concept\r\nhas the advantage of encompassing all of the varied\r\nelements of concern, including preventive diplomacy, post-\r\nconflict peace-building, poverty eradication and the negative\r\neffects of globalization.\r\nAs the Secretary-General clearly pointed out in his\r\nreport, to meet the humanitarian challenge successfully and\r\nhelp prevent man-made disasters, we must first understand\r\nthe underlying causes and then devise appropriate\r\nprevention strategies.\r\nBut before we can arrive at the hoped-for results, we\r\nmust first and foremost, at this session, give in-depth\r\nconsideration to key questions such as the implementation\r\nof the resolutions of the Organization, the revitalization of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly and the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations system. This will enable us to arrive at the\r\nnecessary conceptual and operational consensus for this\r\nOrganization to meet the fundamental challenge of the\r\ntwenty-first century — the humanitarian challenge.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): My delegation would like\r\nto join previous speakers who have congratulated the\r\nSecretary-General on his lucid and thought-provoking\r\nreport, which is now before us. We have no doubt that the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s recommendations, if implemented\r\nfaithfully, will contribute greatly towards achieving the\r\ngoals for which the United Nations was created.\r\nThis is a crucial phase for our Organization in terms\r\nof its primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The absoluteness of its\r\nauthority as regards the legitimate use of force is being\r\ntested, even doubted. We do not share these doubts. The\r\nCharter, which has been signed by 188 Member States,\r\nbestows on the Security Council primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security, except in situations\r\nof self-defence, as set out in Article 51. Only the Council\r\nmay employ coercive measures, including the use of armed\r\nforce. There can be no substitute for the Charter, nor can it\r\nbe superseded, for there is no other legal international\r\ninstrument which enjoys the unanimous support of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nDespite its five decades of existence, the Charter is\r\nstill not merely relevant but indispensable, and its\r\nprovisions and its purposes need no change. What is\r\nneeded, we hold, is the faithful implementation of all its\r\nprovisions, including those in Article 43 on the\r\nestablishment of a permanent international security\r\nsystem, which have remained unimplemented since the\r\ninception of the Charter. The Charter remains the sole and\r\nexclusive legal source for the legitimate use of armed\r\nforce when dealing with breaches of peace and security.\r\nWhat about situations, we are asked, of brutal\r\ndisregard of humanitarian norms within a State? Is the\r\nprinciple of non-interference applicable? Does respect for\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States prevail?\r\nWe believe that in such situations the international\r\ncommunity cannot remain apathetic, especially in cases\r\nwhere gross and systematic violations of human rights,\r\ninvolving thousands of people, are perpetrated.\r\nInvolvement, however, must be based on the Charter and\r\non the legality of a United Nations mandate. If we accept\r\ninterventions outside the United Nations, we may be\r\nopening a Pandora\u0027s box, for there will always be those\r\nleaders who will cover their sinister designs for expansion\r\nthrough aggression with a pretext of humanitarianism and\r\nthe protection of minorities and ethnic groups. Article 2,\r\nparagraph 4, prohibits such use of force.\r\nWhat is to be done, however, when the Security\r\nCouncil finds itself unable to undertake military action?\r\nFirst of all, the Charter provides for a number of coercive\r\nmeasures not involving the use of armed force, which the\r\nCouncil may adopt. If these measures, provided for in\r\nArticle 41 of the Charter, prove inadequate, the issue may\r\nbe brought before the General Assembly for\r\nconsideration.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General identifies\r\nnumerous causes for the probability of wars, such as\r\npoverty and inequality, economic decline, control of\r\neconomic resources, and dehumanizing ideologies\r\npropagated by hate-media. We agree with previous\r\nspeakers that militant separatist movements can also be\r\ncauses of conflicts and can pose grave dangers to the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States. Militant\r\nseparatism, besides being anachronistic in a globalized\r\nand interdependent world, attacks the very substance of\r\npeaceful, integrated coexistence. It emphasizes what\r\ndivides and segregates rather than what unites and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nintegrates. Hence, we find agenda item 34, “Dialogue\r\namong civilizations”, useful for bridging these differences.\r\nWe agree that the prevention of conflicts saves both\r\nhuman lives and valuable resources. We must ensure,\r\nhowever, that preventive diplomacy is conducted in\r\naccordance with the Charter. Perhaps primary attention\r\nshould be given to the long-unresolved problems which\r\nneed to be addressed with justice and fairness and in\r\naccordance with United Nations principles and resolutions\r\nbefore they become even greater crises.\r\nWe agree that cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations should be further strengthened,\r\nso long as this does not lead to disregard for the\r\nindispensability of the United Nations in the\r\ncommencement and carrying out of peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nFinally, we support discussion of the issue of\r\nhumanitarian intervention to clarify terms such as\r\n“humanitarian crisis”, and to agree on criteria and a legal\r\nframework for any enforcement action on the basis of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. The initiative of Egypt, to discuss\r\nthe international response to humanitarian crises within the\r\nGeneral Assembly\u0027s Open-ended Working Group on An\r\nAgenda for Peace, meets with our full support.\r\nMr. Jordán-Pando (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwish, Sir, to renew my delegation\u0027s congratulations on the\r\nrecognition the General Assembly has offered you in\r\nelecting you its President. I wish also to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General and to thank him for his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization, contained in document A/54/1.\r\nAs always, it is complete, informative, comprehensive and\r\nvery thought-provoking. The report makes us think about\r\nways to deal with issues of concern to the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nAt the 32nd plenary meeting, held last Friday, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Spain, Ambassador Inocencio\r\nF. Arias, drew on the report of the Secretary-General to\r\ndiscuss the clash between the universally recognized\r\nprinciple of respect for sovereignty, which is essential and\r\nvital for international law, and the so-called principle — not\r\nuniversally recognized — of humanitarian intervention,\r\nwhich thus far lacks a context, international recognition,\r\nand a formal legal framework. Ambassador Arias noted\r\nthose deficiencies and related them to the ambit of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThat representative ably raised a number of\r\nquestions that certainly gave us all food for thought: First,\r\nis it only the Security Council that under international law\r\nhas the right to intervene? Secondly, what happens when\r\nthe Security Council finds itself paralyzed? Thirdly,\r\nshould the international community in the twenty-first\r\ncentury remain passive when a permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council uses its veto? Fourthly, can collective\r\noutrage be stifled by respect for the principle of\r\nsovereignty or by the obstruction of a single country?\r\nAnd fifthly, which will prevail: absolute and unfailing\r\nrespect for sovereignty, the will of a Power or group of\r\nPowers, or the outcry of society once it has decided not\r\nto remain inactive?\r\nThose issues raised by Ambassador Arias relate to\r\npeace and security — and to the Security Council, a\r\nmatter the General Assembly has been discussing for\r\nmore than six years in an attempt to bring the legal\r\nframework of 1945 into the twenty-first century. Indeed,\r\nthis has been one of the crucial United Nations issues for\r\nthe past 54 years. These are philosophical and legal issues\r\nrelating to international law, and it would take a great\r\ndeal of time to consider them and to reach agreement on\r\nthem. They will be fuel for intellectual exercises, for\r\ndiplomacy, and for our discussions here in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe have not yet been able fully to assess the cost\r\nthe Organization and to the international community had\r\nto pay and are continuing to pay because, for example, of\r\nthe inability to enable so-called international legality to\r\noperate in the case of Kosovo.\r\nObviously, it would be logical for the current\r\nproblems of our Organization and the United Nations\r\nsystem to be the subjects of the Millennium Assembly\r\nand the Millennium Summit, which is to be called “The\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century.” In this way\r\nwe would not simply hand over this century\u0027s problems to\r\nthe next century. We could at least change the terms of\r\nthe debate a little, offering new beginnings for possible\r\nsolutions. It is felt, however, that we should take up\r\nissues of great importance, such as the eradication of\r\npoverty. But these, issues can be left to specific regional\r\nand international interactional forums, with the\r\nparticipation of Governments, national and international\r\nspecialists, agencies of the United Nations system, our\r\nregional economic commissions, international\r\norganizations and so forth. To do otherwise would be to\r\ndistract ourselves, with the result that, for reasons of time\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 October 1999\r\nand resources, we could not take up issues critical to our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThere are other crises which are, like the ones I have\r\nmentioned, among the issues raised by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I am thinking of the financing of development and\r\ncooperation for development, which support the\r\ndevelopment structure of the developing or, to be blunt, the\r\nunderdeveloped — and the 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct that is supposed to come from all the developed\r\ncountries, but, with the exception mainly of the Nordic\r\ncountries, does not.\r\nIf this is directly related to the costs of\r\npeacekeeping — and there is a direct relation — then one\r\ncan conclude that we are just creating another vicious\r\ncircle, as in the case of the Security Council with regard to\r\nfinancing development and financing peacekeeping. There\r\nis a desire to put a percentage ceiling on military\r\npeacekeeping costs, but nobody thinks about also approving\r\nsufficient funds, as advocated in the Charter, for\r\ndevelopment. On the contrary, resources for development\r\nand cooperation for development are constantly being\r\ndrastically reduced because of peacekeeping costs; they are\r\nbeing totally consumed by those costs. The donor countries\r\nare reducing their contributions for development on the\r\nground that they have to increase their peacekeeping\r\ncontributions. In fact, the United Nations should maintain\r\nsufficient financing for the development of Member States.\r\nOn the other hand, Member States must cover the cost of\r\npeacekeeping, for all States have a duty in the maintenance\r\nof peace. We already have our figures assigned and agreed\r\nmultilaterally, not through negotiations.\r\nOn this point, my delegation takes this opportunity to\r\nsay, as it has in the Second Committee and Fifth\r\nCommittee, that there should be differential treatment with\r\nrespect to such costs. Obviously, for example, countries\r\ninvolved in conflict without going through the Security\r\nCouncil or complying with international legality should\r\npay more than those which respect the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. There is a difference between financing\r\ndestruction and financing useful construction. I am\r\nreferring only to costs within the United Nations system.\r\nFinally, my delegation thinks that the eradication of\r\npoverty should be taken up in a special world forum, just\r\nas the information revolution — based on electronics,\r\ninformatics and telecommunications — should be\r\nconsidered in other regional and world forums so as to\r\nuniversalize education in science, technology and\r\ninformation technology. In this way, knowledge would\r\nbecome more universal. This has to be a matter of\r\nconstant concern to the United Nations, for countries that\r\nare not involved in the information revolution will not be\r\nable to enter the twenty-first century. They will\r\nmarginalize, and so will universities and educational\r\ninstitutions at all levels if they are not part of these\r\nuniversal networks. I am even bold enough to think and\r\nsay — and I have proposed this to the Chairman of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, Ambassador Paolo Fulci of\r\nItaly — that the work of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should be extended, so that it would become the\r\nEconomic, Social, Science and Technology Committee.\r\nThose are my delegation\u0027s contributions and\r\nsuggestions in connection with the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly takes note of the report (A/54/1) of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 10.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.45 p.m.\r\n13\r\n"
