(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of the first President of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, His Excellency Mr. Julius\r\nNyerere, and the staff members of the United Nations\r\nkilled in Kosovo and Burundi\r\nThe President: It is with deep personal sadness that\r\nI learned of the passing of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, first\r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania, a venerable\r\nworld leader and one of Africa\u0027s most charismatic and\r\nrespected elder statesmen. He died overnight in London at\r\nthe age of 77 after suffering from leukaemia.\r\nPresident Nyerere\u0027s life was legendary. Born in 1922\r\nin a village near Lake Victoria, he entered politics in 1954,\r\nfounding the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU),\r\nand the campaign for independence from colonial rule. He\r\nbecame Chief Minister of British-ruled Tanganyika in 1960.\r\nHe then led his country to independence in 1961, serving\r\nfirst as Prime Minister and, from 1964, as President of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMwalimu was the pillar of his nation\u0027s politics and a\r\nmediator whose wise counsel other world leaders sought.\r\nHe stepped down voluntarily in 1985, one of a very few\r\nAfrican leaders of his generation to do so.\r\nI, too, was a beneficiary of Mwalimu\u0027s political\r\ntutelage and of Tanzania\u0027s generosity. They provided me\r\nwith a free haven when I fled my own country, Namibia,\r\nin 1962 to escape South Africa\u0027s brutal apartheid\r\ncolonialism in Namibia.\r\nThe Tanzanian people have lost the father of their\r\nnation, the courageous leader of their independence\r\nstruggle and the architect of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania. The African people as a whole have lost an\r\nardent pan-Africanist, a man of high principles, a man of\r\nself-abnegation and a champion of African self-\r\ndetermination, liberation and independence. Without Mr.\r\nNyerere\u0027s firm guidance and steadfast support, the\r\nstruggle for liberation, particularly in southern Africa,\r\nwould have been even more difficult and divisive within\r\nthe ranks of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and other freedom-loving\r\nforces in the world. Mwalimu was the force behind the\r\nsouthern African front-line States and their foremost\r\nstrategist and intellectual mentor.\r\nMwalimu\u0027s contributions to public life did not end\r\nwith his retirement from office. He served as Chairman of\r\nthe South Commission from 1987 to 1990 and was later\r\nnamed Honorary Chairman of the intergovernmental\r\nSouth Centre, which promotes South-South cooperation\r\nand solidarity.\r\nAt the time of his death, President Nyerere was\r\nserving as chief mediator in the negotiations to end the\r\ncivil war in Burundi. He devoted much of his time to\r\nseeking African solutions to African problems, working\r\ndiligently to promote African unity.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly and in my own\r\npersonal capacity, I extend heartfelt condolences to his\r\nbereaved family and to the courageous people of Tanzania\r\nat the passing of their founding father and extraordinary\r\nleader.\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 14 October 1999\r\nIt is also my sad duty to pay tribute to the memory of\r\nthe staff members of the United Nations who were recently\r\nkilled in Kosovo and Burundi in the line of duty.\r\nOnce again, United Nations staff members have paid\r\nthe ultimate price in the line of duty. They sacrificed their\r\nlives in Kosovo and Burundi while serving the cause of\r\npeace. The loss of three staff members within a 24-hour\r\nperiod underscores the often difficult and dangerous\r\nconditions under which United Nations personnel serve.\r\nThe deaths of Valentin Krumov in Kosovo and of Luis\r\nZuniga and Saskia von Meijenfeldt in Burundi bring to 13\r\nthe number of civilian staff killed this year alone in the\r\nfield of operations. This saddening statistic indicates a sharp\r\nincrease in attacks on United Nations personnel and calls\r\nfor effective measures by Governments, and particularly\r\nparties in conflict situations, to ensure the safety and\r\nsecurity of United Nations personnel and other humanitarian\r\nworkers.\r\nI strongly condemn these wanton acts of brutality\r\nagainst peacemakers and peace workers and call upon the\r\ninternational community to assist the United Nations in\r\nfurther intensifying public education with the view to\r\nputting an end to the loss of innocent lives.\r\nIn Kosovo, on Monday evening, Mr. Valentin\r\nKrumov, a 38- year-old Bulgarian national, was brutally\r\nassaulted by a crowd and then shot dead on a street in\r\nPristina. Mr. Krumov had just arrived in that city to take up\r\nhis assignment with the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). He became\r\nUNMIK\u0027s first casualty. An eyewitness reported that he was\r\nshot after replying in Serbian when asked for the time.\r\nIn Burundi, on 12 October, Mr. Luis Zuniga, a 52-\r\nyear-old Chilean national and a representative of the United\r\nNations Children\u0027s Fund, and Ms. Saskia von Meijenfeldt,\r\na 34-year-old Dutch national and a logistics officer with the\r\nWorld Food Programme, were killed in a road ambush.\r\nThey were part of an inter-agency team that was carrying\r\nout an assessment of humanitarian needs in a camp for\r\ndisplaced persons. Seven Burundian nationals also lost their\r\nlives and several others were seriously injured in that\r\nterrible tragedy.\r\nJustice demands that the perpetrators of these heinous\r\ncrimes be apprehended and prosecuted. Such criminal acts\r\ncommitted within the territory of a Member State must not\r\ngo unpunished. While many such incidents are carried out\r\nby lawless elements outside the control of Governments,\r\nMember States can and must play a decisive role by\r\nensuring scrupulous adherence to international\r\nhumanitarian law instruments, including the relevant\r\nconventions. The 1994 Convention on the Safety of\r\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel, which entered\r\ninto force this year, establishes the legal framework for\r\nprotecting United Nations staff members in situations of\r\narmed conflict.\r\nToday, we mourn the untimely deaths of staff\r\nmembers whose loyalty and commitment to the noble\r\nideals of the United Nations remained unflinching to their\r\nlast breath. In this hour of sorrow and bereavement, I\r\ncommend the courage and dedication of those who\r\nfaithfully put their lives on the line in the service of the\r\nUnited Nations and of humanity. It was with this in mind\r\nthat I told United Nations personnel last month, on the\r\noccasion of the Millennium Staff Day, “You are the\r\nlifeblood of the United Nations”. For whenever a staff\r\nmember is killed in the line of duty, all of us bleed. We\r\nmust ensure the safety and security of those who carry the\r\nUnited Nations flag, especially staff members in the field\r\nin peacekeeping missions or at United Nations outposts\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I extend our\r\ndeepest condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the\r\nbereaved families and friends of those who lost their lives\r\nin the cause of peace. Let us today pledge, individually\r\nand collectively, to do all in our power to stem the tide of\r\nviolence that destroys hope and impedes peacekeeping\r\nand peace enforcement in the world.\r\nI call now on the Deputy Secretary-General.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: Let me start, Mr.\r\nPresident, by joining you in paying homage to Julius\r\nNyerere, the founder and first President of the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, an architect of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and one of the giants of the twentieth-\r\ncentury African liberation movement. He was Mwalimu,\r\nor Teacher, to us all, and his death takes from us a good\r\nfriend and a tireless supporter of the United Nations.\r\nAs I address the General Assembly this morning, the\r\nfollowing scenes are unfolding elsewhere: the family of\r\nValentin Krumov of Bulgaria is mourning his brutal\r\nmurder in Pristina on the very day he took up his duties\r\nthere. The families of Luis Zuniga of Chile and of Saskia\r\nvon Meijenfeldt of the Netherlands are preparing to bury\r\ntheir loved ones, killed in cold blood while on a mission\r\nin Burundi to assess humanitarian needs. And the families\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 14 October 1999\r\nof still more United Nations colleagues, held hostage in\r\nGeorgia, are waiting in anguish for word of their fate.\r\nSuch incidents — killings, assaults, harassment,\r\nkidnappings — have become far too routine in conflict\r\nzones throughout the world. United Nations staff have\r\nbecome targets, not through any fault of their own but\r\nbecause there are those who seek advantage in flouting\r\ninternational humanitarian norms and simple human\r\ndecency.\r\nAll too often the targeting is deliberate, directed not\r\nonly against United Nations staff but also against non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross. This is not only wrong; it is depriving the\r\ninternational community of a precious tool with which to\r\nrelieve the suffering caused by war and humanitarian\r\nemergencies.\r\nSome will say there is little that can be done against\r\nhatred and violence. I beg to differ, and I do so in the\r\nstrongest possible terms. Some things are indeed beyond\r\nour control, but much is within it. Member States bear\r\nprimary responsibility for ensuring the security of United\r\nNations staff. Here are some measures they can take: first,\r\nthey can conduct vigorous investigations into all such\r\nkillings and incidents, prosecuting those responsible to the\r\nfull extent of the law. To our knowledge, only one person\r\nhas ever been found guilty and has been imprisoned for\r\nkilling or causing the death of a United Nations staff\r\nmember. This impunity cannot be allowed to stand.\r\nSecondly, those who have not done so already can\r\nsign and ratify two conventions. The Convention on the\r\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel has\r\ncome into force at long last, but only 29 nations have\r\nratified it. The Rome Statute for an International Criminal\r\nCourt, not yet in force, will make it a war crime to attack\r\npersonnel involved in a humanitarian-assistance or\r\npeacekeeping mission pursued in accordance with the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThirdly, Member States can provide the funding\r\nneeded to improve staff security. We need more security\r\nofficers and stress counsellors, and more training. Improved\r\nsecurity is not a luxury. It should be viewed, as it would be\r\nin any private firm, as an essential operating cost.\r\nAnd fourthly, Member States can use their influence\r\nover those who control the territories in which these\r\natrocities occur. They can exert more influence over States,\r\nor over factions within them, to bring their forces under\r\nbetter control and discipline.\r\nWe all know that risk is part of our jobs. But a\r\ndesperate irony is developing: Member States are willing\r\nto send unarmed civilians into places where they will not\r\nsend well armed soldiers. As the Secretary-General has\r\nsaid to them in the past, these are your own citizens who\r\nare venturing into peril. Let us consider what more we\r\ncan do, on an urgent basis, to ensure that they can carry\r\nout their vital work in safety. Let us send our prayers to\r\nall who are mourning today.\r\nAnd let us recognize that if we fail to act there will\r\nbe more families and friends who will mourn tomorrow,\r\nand the day after that. That is not something any of us\r\nwould wish on any other human being, or want to have\r\non our conscience. So we must prevent it.\r\nThe President:I now invite representatives to stand\r\nand observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory\r\nof those deceased staff members.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silence.\r\nAgenda item 125\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that\r\nthe Gambia has made the necessary payment to reduce its\r\narrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In this connection, a new document\r\nwill be issued tomorrow morning under the symbol\r\nA/54/464.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 14 October 1999\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\nproceed to the election of five non-permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council to replace those members whose term\r\nof office expires on 31 December 1999.\r\nThe five non-permanent outgoing members are the\r\nfollowing: Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, the Gambia and\r\nSlovenia. These five States cannot be re-elected and\r\ntherefore their names should not appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the Security\r\nCouncil will include in the year 2000 the following States:\r\nArgentina, Canada, Malaysia, Namibia and the Netherlands.\r\nThe names of those States, therefore, should also not appear\r\non the ballot papers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members which will remain\r\nin office in the year 2000, two are from Africa and Asia,\r\none is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two are\r\nfrom Western European and other States.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963,\r\nthe five non-permanent members should be elected\r\naccording to the following pattern: three from Africa and\r\nAsia, one from Eastern Europe and one from Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is an\r\nunderstanding to the effect that, of the three States to be\r\nelected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa\r\nand one from Asia.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the number\r\nof candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be\r\nfilled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-\r\nthirds majority of those present and voting will be declared\r\nelected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there\r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which\r\nhave obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that\r\nprocedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by the\r\nChairmen of the respective regional groups that, for the\r\nthree vacant seats from among the African and Asian\r\nStates, there are three endorsed candidates, namely,\r\nBangladesh, Mali and Tunisia.\r\nFrom among the Eastern European States, there are\r\ntwo candidates for one vacant seat. The candidates are\r\nSlovakia and Ukraine.\r\nAs for the Latin American and Caribbean States,\r\nJamaica is the endorsed candidate for one vacant seat.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nwe shall proceed now to the election by secret ballot.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed and to write on them the\r\nnames of the five States for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a\r\nballot paper which do not belong to that region will not\r\nbe counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Saizonou\r\n(Benin), Mr. Toscano (Ecuador) and Mr. Nguyen\r\nThi Thanh Ha (Viet Nam) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.10 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.15 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African and Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 172\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 172\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 172\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 115\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBangladesh 172\r\nTunisia 172\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 14 October 1999\r\nMali 171\r\nGroup B — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 172\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 171\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumbers of members voting: 171\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nUkraine 92\r\nSlovakia 79\r\nGroup C — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 172\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 171\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumbers of members voting: 171\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nJamaica 171\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority, the\r\nfollowing States were elected members of the Security\r\nCouncil for a two-year term beginning 1 January\r\n2000: Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali and Tunisia.\r\nThe President: There remains one seat to be filled,\r\nfrom among the Eastern European States. We shall\r\ntherefore proceed to the first restricted ballot.\r\nThis second round of balloting shall be restricted to\r\nthe two States from among the Eastern European States that\r\nwere not elected but that obtained the largest number of\r\nvotes in the previous ballot, namely Slovakia and Ukraine.\r\nThis is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure.\r\nBallot papers marked “B”, for the Eastern European\r\nStates, will now be distributed. May I ask representatives to\r\nwrite on the ballot papers the name of the one State for\r\nwhich they wish to vote.\r\nBallot papers marked “B” will be declared invalid if\r\nthey contain the name of a State other than Slovakia or\r\nUkraine, as well as if they contain the names of more than\r\none State.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Saizonou\r\n(Benin), Mr. Toscano (Ecuador) and Mrs. Nguyen Thi\r\nThanh Ha (Viet Nam) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.50 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup B — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 171\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 170\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 170\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nUkraine 98\r\nSlovakia 72\r\nThe President: Since no candidate obtained the\r\nrequired two-thirds majority in the previous ballot, there\r\nremains one seat to be filled from among the Eastern\r\nEuropean States. We shall therefore proceed to a second\r\nrestricted ballot.\r\nThis third round of balloting shall be restricted to the\r\ntwo States from among the Eastern European States that\r\nwere not elected but that obtained the largest number of\r\nvotes in the previous ballot — namely, Slovakia and\r\nUkraine.

We are particularly grateful to them,\r\nand will remember their support in our future work here in\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI now formally withdraw the candidature of Slovakia,\r\nand wish Ukraine well.\r\nThe President: We shall now begin the voting\r\nprocess, taking into consideration the statement just made\r\nby the representative of Slovakia.\r\nSince no candidate obtained the required two-thirds\r\nmajority, there still remains one seat to be filled, from\r\namong the Eastern European States.
