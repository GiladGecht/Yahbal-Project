(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Jayanama\r\n(Thailand), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/54/2)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, His Excellency\r\nMr. Sergey Lavrov, to introduce the report of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):\r\nIt is my privilege to introduce to the General Assembly the\r\nannual report of the Security Council, covering the period\r\nfrom 16 June 1998 to 15 June 1999.\r\nThe members of the Security Council traditionally\r\nattach great importance to the timely preparation and\r\npresentation of this report, pursuant to Articles 15 and 24\r\nof the United Nations Charter. As in previous years, the\r\ndraft report was approved at a formal meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council. The members of the Security Council\r\nensured that the report was submitted in a timely manner to\r\nthe General Assembly before the beginning of the general\r\ndebate at the current session. They are grateful to the staff\r\nof the Security Council secretariat for their professionalism\r\nand tireless efforts on behalf of the Security Council.\r\nThe report clearly shows that the Security Council\u0027s\r\nworking agenda during the reporting period was\r\nextremely full and intense. Over 100 official meetings\r\nwere held and 72 resolutions and 37 presidential\r\nstatements adopted.\r\nThe range of issues considered by the Council\r\nremains very wide, covering all major aspects of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Issues\r\nrelated to the settlement of regional conflicts and to\r\nensuring stability in Africa remain high on the Council\u0027s\r\nagenda. Drawing on the results of its consideration of\r\nrelevant reports of the Secretary-General, the Council\r\nadopted a number of specific long-term decisions in\r\nrespect of these reports. The Council also paid close\r\nattention to the issues of preventing and settling conflicts\r\nand stabilizing the situation in the Balkan region. The\r\nadoption of resolution 1244 (1999) on the situation in\r\nKosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has significantly\r\nstrengthened the central role of the Council in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIssues related to the settlement of conflict situations\r\nin other regions, including the Middle East, the Persian\r\nGulf, East Timor, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Georgia,\r\nfigured prominently in the work of the Security Council.\r\nA number of global aspects of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and joint efforts to\r\ncombat international terrorism remain on the Council\u0027s\r\nagenda. In particular, decisions on post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding, the protection of and humanitarian assistance to\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nrefugees and other civilians during conflicts, and\r\nchildren in armed conflict were adopted. The discussions on\r\nthese problems contribute to their due consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and other United Nations organs and\r\nhelp the Security Council better to fulfil the tasks assigned\r\nto it by the international community.\r\nIn the period covered by this report, the Security\r\nCouncil adopted several steps to improve its working\r\nmethods and those of the sanctions committees, as well as\r\nto make the deliberations of its members more transparent\r\nto the general membership of the United Nations.\r\nThe present report, like last year\u0027s, has been prepared\r\nin the new format, reflecting the intention of Council\r\nmembers to ensure greater transparency in its work. The\r\nmembers of the Security Council hope that the report will\r\nprovide useful and detailed information on the activities of\r\nthe Council during the year. They attach great significance\r\nto the consideration of the report by the General Assembly\r\nas an important part of the dialogue between the two\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, and will duly take\r\ninto account remarks and suggestions made by member\r\nStates in the course of today\u0027s discussion.\r\nMr. Satoh (Japan): I would like to thank the President\r\nof the Security Council, Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, for his\r\narticulate presentation of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly.\r\nWe welcome the effort by the Council to share\r\ninformation on its activities with the rest of the United\r\nNations membership.\r\nToday, I would like to draw the attention of my\r\ncolleagues to some of the important developments relating\r\nto the Security Council that are not recorded in the report,\r\nsuch as the growing involvement of non-Council members\r\nin the activities to facilitate and support the Security\r\nCouncil\u0027s actions on humanitarian crises. It is noteworthy\r\nthat in recent years non-Council members have been\r\nincreasingly engaged in efforts to complement the actions\r\nof the Security Council. The experiences of Kosovo and\r\nEast Timor are cases in point.\r\nOn Kosovo, the Security Council failed initially to\r\nfunction effectively, although the Council was eventually\r\ncalled in to take over the issue. It was a combination of\r\nintensive efforts by some members of the Council and non-\r\nCouncil members that laid the groundwork for Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999). Later the countries belonging to the\r\nGroup of Friends on Kosovo also played a constructive role\r\nin helping the United Nations Interim Administration\r\nMission in Kosovo to carry out its task.\r\nOn East Timor, the Security Council could act very\r\nquickly, particularly as compared with the case of\r\nKosovo, because the Indonesian Government cooperated\r\nflexibly with the Council. The Secretary-General played\r\na crucial role in persuading the Indonesian Government to\r\naccept the international force. But we must not ignore the\r\nfact that the Indonesian Government listened carefully to\r\nquiet advice given by some friendly nations in the region,\r\nas it made critical decisions to respond flexibly to the call\r\nof the Secretary-General and the international public\r\nopinion behind him.\r\nMore important, it was the consultations and\r\npreparations by the countries in the region, if not by a\r\nregional organization, that paved the way for the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the popular consultation on\r\n30 August, and later for the quick establishment of an\r\ninternational force in East Timor, in accordance with\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1264 (1999).\r\nIn Africa, however, the Council acted almost single-\r\nhandedly. The experience of Angola to date is most\r\ndisappointing in this context. There, the Council issued\r\nresolution after resolution, only to see them unheeded and\r\nignored by the warring parties. The Council imposed\r\nsanctions, but they were not observed. Ultimately, the\r\nCouncil had to withdraw its peacekeeping operation from\r\nthat country.\r\nWhile we welcome the Council\u0027s renewed initiative\r\ntowards peace and national reconciliation in Angola, taken\r\nlast Friday, this past year\u0027s unfortunate developments shed\r\nlight not only on the difficulty the Council faces when it\r\nhas to act in the sheer absence of a commitment to peace\r\non the part of warring parties, but also on the importance\r\nof securing compliance with the decisions of the Council\r\nby countries in the region.\r\nIndeed, there are encouraging examples of local\r\ninitiatives to complement the Security Council\u0027s activity.\r\nFor example, in Sierra Leone the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and its military sub-\r\norganization, the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG), as well as the countries in the region, have\r\nplayed a significant role in restoring and maintaining\r\npeace in the country. The tireless leadership of former\r\nPresident Nyerere, whom we lost recently, must be\r\nremembered as a driving force for peace in the process to\r\nbring stability to Burundi. And, the efforts of countries\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nconcerned and the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) were also conducive to ensuring a\r\nceasefire agreement for the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nNotwithstanding these encouraging initiatives by\r\nAfrican countries and their regional groups, it is evident\r\nthat support and assistance from the developed countries in\r\nthe North are vitally important in order to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of conflicts and humanitarian emergencies in\r\nAfrica. Yet we have to admit that such support has so far\r\nbeen either too slow or too small, or both, particularly as\r\ncompared with the cases of Kosovo and East Timor.\r\nNeed for stronger leadership on the part of the\r\nSecurity Council in drawing the international community\u0027s\r\nattention more to crises in Africa cannot be\r\noveremphasized. Equally important is a positive response\r\nfrom the international community to calls for help and\r\nsupport.\r\nIn the light of the situations I have described, there is\r\nno doubt that support from non-Council members is\r\nessential for the success of the Council\u0027s activities on\r\nhumanitarian crises. It is therefore important for the Council\r\nto increase the transparency of its activities and to share\r\nwhat it knows with non-Council members.\r\nTo make the Security Council more effective and\r\nmore credible is what all the Members of the United\r\nNations now want. We have to admit that increased\r\ntransparency does not necessarily lead to the enhanced\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council. However transparent\r\nthe Council may become, or however many open meetings\r\nmay be held, such steps alone would not automatically\r\nenhance the Council\u0027s effectiveness.\r\nThe Council\u0027s effectiveness can be enhanced by the\r\nefforts of its members to act promptly and effectively, and\r\nthe responsibilities of the permanent members are\r\nparticularly great in this regard. Equally important is that\r\nthe Council\u0027s decisions should be respected and observed\r\nfully by the entire United Nations membership. We have\r\nalready learned enough about this, and we are now required\r\nto redouble our efforts to practise what we have learned.\r\nMr. Yel\u0027chenko (Ukraine): I should like to start by\r\nexpressing my delegation\u0027s appreciation to Ambassador\r\nSergey Lavrov, President of the Security Council for the\r\ncurrent month, for presenting the annual report (A/54/2) on\r\nthe work of this organ, covering the period from 16 June\r\n1998 to 15 June 1999.\r\nUkraine attaches particular importance to the item\r\n“Report of the Security Council”. In the view of my\r\ndelegation, the Council’s main purpose has to be viewed\r\nas upholding the principle of accountability, which is\r\nfundamental to ensuring the effectiveness of any political\r\norganization, especially if it is made up of sovereign\r\nStates. Consideration of this agenda item has always\r\noffered the General Assembly a unique opportunity to\r\nmake a comprehensive assessment of the Security\r\nCouncil\u0027s activities over the past year and to discuss the\r\nmanner in which the Council carries out its\r\nresponsibilities as enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn making my delegation\u0027s contribution to this\r\nimportant discussion, I find it very difficult to abstract\r\nmyself from the fact that just a few days ago this General\r\nAssembly elected Ukraine to serve as a non-permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council for the next two years. In\r\nthis connection, let me take this occasion to convey\r\nthrough you, Sir, my Government\u0027s most sincere\r\nappreciation to all Member States for the high honour\r\nconferred on Ukraine. I would like to reiterate that my\r\ncountry is prepared to discharge the important\r\nresponsibilities of a non-permanent member of the\r\nCouncil, and will do so in the interest of all Member\r\nStates of the United Nations.\r\nIn my delegation\u0027s view, despite the energy and\r\nintensity which characterized the Security Council\u0027s work,\r\nthe 12 months covered by the report will go down in\r\nhistory as a difficult year for the United Nations. But at\r\nthe same time, those 12 months have impressively\r\nsupported these famous words pronounced almost 40\r\nyears ago:\r\n“Our instrument and our hope is the\r\nUnited Nations, and there is little merit in the\r\nimpatience of those who would abandon this\r\nimperfect world instrument because they dislike\r\nour imperfect world”.\r\nUkraine is convinced that the Member States should\r\nbe really determined to preserve the unique role of the\r\nSecurity Council in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security in the next century. Once such determination\r\nprevails, the main task on our agenda will consist of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s comprehensive transformation, affecting almost\r\nevery aspect of its activities, as well as its current\r\ncomposition and methods of work.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nIn this context, I would like to comment briefly on\r\nsome domains where, in the view of my delegation,\r\nchanges are indeed imperative. First, Ukraine is convinced\r\nthat adequate and equal attention on the part of the Security\r\nCouncil to conflict situations in different regions constitutes\r\nan essential prerequisite for upholding the Council\u0027s\r\nauthority in the field of international peace and security.\r\nCertainly, the most flagrant case here will be the kind of\r\nresponse provided so far by the Security Council to the real\r\ndemands and needs of the African continent. On the one\r\nhand, it is really difficult to blame the Council for the lack\r\nof attention to Africa, to which over 60 per cent of the\r\nissues currently under active consideration by that organ are\r\nrelated. However, Ukraine understands the feeling of\r\ndisappointment on the part of African countries, which\r\nexpect more energetic action on the part of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn recent times, there have been encouraging signs that\r\nthe Security Council has started to make some drastic\r\nchanges in its overall attitude towards Africa. Important\r\nevidence of this promising trend is that the Council is about\r\nto authorize a peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone.\r\nFurthermore, the members of the Council continue to\r\ndebate the possibilities of authorizing a peacekeeping\r\noperation to provide assistance in the implementation of the\r\nLusaka Agreement on the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. It is worthwhile to stress that the final outcomes not\r\nonly will be important not only for the Lusaka and Lomé\r\nprocesses, but will bear fundamental significance for the\r\nentire African continent. They will provide clear testimony\r\nas to whether the ill-famed “Afro-fatigue syndrome” and\r\n“Afro-pessimism” have definitely given way to “Afro-\r\nenthusiasm”.\r\nSecondly, there is an urgent need to reinforce the\r\npreventive dimension in the Security Council\u0027s activities. In\r\nhis latest annual report on the work of the Organization, the\r\nSecretary-General presented convincing arguments for why\r\nit is imperative for the United Nations to start the transition\r\nfrom a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention.\r\nUndoubtedly, it is the Security Council which has to play\r\na leading role in such a transition. Preventive diplomacy,\r\npreventive deployment and preventive disarmament as the\r\nmain short-term strategies, and comprehensive peace-\r\nbuilding addressing the root causes of conflict as the long-\r\nterm preventive strategy, have to acquire prominence and\r\neven predominance in the Council\u0027s activities. Furthermore,\r\nthe Council has to move further towards starting a new\r\nphase in the history of its relationship with United Nations\r\nMember States, from which it derives all its power and\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nIt is undeniable that over the past few years the\r\nSecurity Council has taken many worthwhile steps in\r\norder to increase the openness and transparency of its\r\nactivities. We welcome this progress and encourage the\r\nSecurity Council to continue this pursuit. In this\r\nconnection, I would like to reiterate that the cornerstone\r\nfor such a relationship is laid down in Articles 31 and 32\r\nof the United Nations Charter. In the view of my\r\ndelegation, the content of those Articles actually implies\r\nthat non-members of the Security Council are provided\r\nwith the same rights to influence the decisions of the\r\nCouncil as its members, except through participation in\r\nthe voting procedure.\r\nThere are also many other domains and dimensions\r\nin which urgent change is pressing. One is the overdue\r\nsolution to the problem of the increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council. Another compelling issue is the\r\nneed to bring into correspondence with today\u0027s world\r\nrealities the Council\u0027s decision-making process.\r\nConsideration of agenda item 38, entitled “Question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related matters”,\r\nwill give us the opportunity to comment in depth on those\r\nproblems.\r\nUkraine remains realistic in the understanding that\r\nthe comprehensive transformation of the Security Council\r\nand its activities does not promise to be an easy\r\nendeavour. Slow progress in the relevant Working Group\r\nof the General Assembly on Security Council reform\r\nshould induce us to kindle as much enthusiasm as\r\npossible and to lower our expectations for quick results;\r\nand let us not forget that the required transformation goes\r\nfar beyond the mandate of the Working Group.\r\nHowever, it must be made clear from the very outset\r\nthat slogans, however resounding and thunderous, will not\r\nsuffice. To achieve success we need to realize the\r\nindispensability of this intergovernmental institution for\r\nour world and for our peoples; we need to understand that\r\nour unwillingness to make concessions will lead to even\r\nworse losses; and we have to display the political will to\r\ntransform such understanding into action.\r\nFor its part, Ukraine is determined to persist in its\r\nefforts towards making progress in all undertakings that\r\nwill result in the strengthening of the United Nations and\r\nits Security Council.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): The Mongolian\r\ndelegation would like to thank Ambassador Lavrov of the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nRussian Federation, current President of the Security\r\nCouncil, for introducing the annual report of the Council to\r\nthe General Assembly, covering the period 16 June 1998 to\r\n15 June 1999. The report is quite voluminous, rich in\r\nfactual material and comprehensive.\r\nMembers of the United Nations have a legitimate\r\ninterest in the activities of the Council, which not only acts\r\non behalf of all of them but also is the only organ whose\r\ndecisions Members have agreed to carry out. Therefore,\r\nMongolia, like other Members of the United Nations,\r\nattaches great importance to the General Assembly\u0027s\r\ndiscussion of the Security Council\u0027s report, as envisaged in\r\nArticle 15 and Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter. This\r\nprovides an opportunity to discuss the activities of the\r\nCouncil and the possible ways and means to maintain or\r\nenhance its credibility, to enhance its effectiveness and the\r\neffectiveness of coordination and interaction between the\r\ntwo main organs of the United Nations, and to make the\r\nGeneral Assembly an effective organ within the powers\r\naccorded to it by the Charter. Therefore, we believe that\r\nsuch consideration is equally useful for the Council and for\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nDuring the year under review, the Council held 121\r\nformal meetings, adopted 72 resolutions, issued 37\r\nstatements by the President and held 239 consultations of\r\nthe whole, totalling some 511 hours. During those meetings\r\nand consultations, much time was devoted to the conflicts\r\nin Africa and to the questions relating to Iraq and the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. This alone demonstrates that the\r\nCouncil has been seriously seized of the many pressing\r\nissues related to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, and has contributed to resolving many issues,\r\nwhile containing others.\r\nThe structure of the report is essentially the same as\r\nlast year\u0027s. A result of the improvements sought and made\r\nduring the last few years, it allows the general membership\r\nto be better informed about the activities of the Council.\r\nOne of the innovations in this year\u0027s report is an addendum\r\nreproducing the statements made by the Presidents of the\r\nCouncil to the press following consultations of the whole of\r\nthe Council. Therefore, with respect to the format of the\r\nreport, my delegation would like to commend the Council.\r\nThe content of the report is also being enriched.\r\nHowever, we believe that there is still room for\r\nimprovement. That would include more analytical reports\r\nor assessments of situations and of the effect of earlier\r\ndecisions taken by the Council, as well as more analytical\r\ninformation on the consultations of the whole, where the\r\ndecisions are taken de facto. Special reports, envisaged by\r\nthe Charter, could focus on specific issues on which the\r\nCouncil could seek the views and recommendations of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOne of the areas where clarification is needed is\r\ncommunications of Governments that are brought to the\r\nattention of the Council. The mere listing of such\r\ncommunications in the report, without disclosing their\r\ncontent, takes 17 pages. Of course, it is assumed that such\r\ncommunications are duly noted by the members of the\r\nCouncil. However, my delegation sees little merit in\r\nmerely reproducing the list of communications without\r\nany comment whatsoever. Perhaps the list could be\r\npresented in a condensed and analytical form. We hope\r\nthat the next report of the Council will be even more in\r\nthe spirit of General Assembly\r\nresolution 51/193.\r\nHaving commented briefly on the report, my\r\ndelegation would like to focus on the following questions.\r\nI begin with peacekeeping operations. The report\r\nclearly demonstrates that they continue to be essential for\r\nmaintaining peace in many parts of the world, including\r\nceasefires within States. Of late the peacekeepers are also\r\nbeing charged with other missions, reflecting, as the\r\nSecretary-General has pointed out in his report (A/54/1)\r\non the work of the Organization, the need for transition\r\nfrom a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. It\r\nalso reflects recognition of the fact that in many cases a\r\nmultidimensional approach to peacekeeping is required.\r\nMy delegation subscribes to the holistic approach to\r\nsecurity. Though not a military Power, Mongolia believes\r\nthat it can make its contribution to peacekeeping\r\noperations by contributing in the areas where it could be\r\nuseful. Bearing this in mind, the Government of Mongolia\r\nhas decided to participate in peacekeeping activities, and\r\nlast month it signed a memorandum of understanding with\r\nthe United Nations on standby arrangements, whereby it\r\nwill participate in future United Nations operations,\r\ncontributing staff officers, military observers and medical\r\nofficers.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nI turn next to humanitarian intervention. The general\r\ndebate and the debate on the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization have demonstrated\r\nthat the question of so-called humanitarian interventions\r\nraises many delicate, debatable and pertinent questions.\r\nThey include questions of State sovereignty and the moral\r\nimperative to act forcefully in the face of gross violations\r\nof human rights. My delegation fully agrees with the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s statement in his report that enforcement\r\nactions without Security Council authorization threaten the\r\nvery core of the international security system founded on\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We therefore believe that\r\nthe Security Council should carefully look into this\r\nquestion, which could have far-reaching consequences.\r\nAnother question that is justly raised is the perceived\r\ninconsistency of the Security Council when responding to\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. This matter was raised in the\r\nSecurity Council itself just recently, when the Council was\r\nconsidering the progress report on the situation in Africa.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the principles of\r\nmultilateralism and humanitarian ethics should be applied\r\nequally, based on the criterion of human need. In this\r\nrespect, my delegation welcomes the steps taken by the\r\nSecurity Council in dispatching its own fact-finding mission\r\nto East Timor, which led to the adoption of its resolution\r\n1264 (1999).\r\nTurning to the question of the relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, my delegation\r\nwould like to point out the importance of involving regional\r\norganizations in peacekeeping operations and managing\r\nregional conflicts. This kind of relationship is important for\r\nmany reasons, including even financial, when decisions are\r\ntaken sometimes by the Council with little regard for their\r\nfinancial requirements. The consequences of such decisions\r\ncould be enormous. We believe that in cases of the\r\ninvolvement of regional organizations, which we support in\r\nprinciple, a clear line of authority should be established on\r\nthe ground, and the central role of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly of the Security Council, should be upheld, as\r\nreflected in the Charter. Acting otherwise, or even\r\ncircumventing the United Nations and the Security Council,\r\nwould not only lead to erosion of the credibility of the\r\nCouncil, but could also have negative consequences for\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nOne positive innovation in the practice of the Security\r\nCouncil is increased holding of open thematic debates on\r\ndifferent issues. Thus, the Council has lately held open\r\ndebates on such issues as landmines, child soldiers,\r\nprotection of humanitarian assistance workers, post-conflict\r\npeace-building, protection of civilians in armed conflict,\r\namong others. Some of those debates were followed by\r\naction on the part of the Council, including statements by\r\nits President and even resolutions of the Council. We\r\nbelieve that this useful practice of involving the wider\r\nmembership of the United Nations should be continued\r\nand enriched.\r\nOpen debate allows non-members of the Council,\r\nespecially smaller States, to contribute to the examination\r\nof the issues. In many cases they are in a better position\r\nto understand the problems, interpret the situation and\r\noffer possible solutions. We agree with the view that such\r\ndebates should be organized and scheduled in such a\r\nmanner as to allow the views of non-members to be not\r\nonly heard, but also considered. That, in our view, would\r\nbe in the spirit of, and correspond to, the purpose of such\r\ndebates. One such issue on which perhaps the Council\r\ncould consult with the general membership in the near\r\nfuture is non-proliferation, the question of assessing the\r\nsituation with respect to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) and how to make it operational. We\r\nbelieve that this matter warrants the Council\u0027s attention,\r\nif not action.\r\nOn the question of sanctions, I can be very brief. My\r\ndelegation\u0027s views were reflected in the 1998 Durban\r\nFinal Document of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe last question that my delegation would like to\r\ntouch upon is that of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council. Although it\r\ndoes not directly relate to the report of the Council, it is\r\nin order to say a word or two about the work of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group.\r\nWe believe that the Working Group is doing a fair\r\njob, although much faster progress is expected of it by the\r\nmajority of the membership. However, the Working\r\nGroup\u0027s progress depends, in the final analysis, on the\r\npositions of States themselves. We believe that most of\r\nthe positive steps taken lately by the Council with respect\r\nto its working methods and rationalization of its\r\nprocedures have been prompted by the proposals made in\r\nthe Working Group. During its last meeting the Working\r\nGroup registered some progress, when it was finally\r\nagreed:\r\n“the question of the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil implies the consideration of the question of\r\nveto”.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nThe Mongolian delegation believes that movement in this\r\ndirection should be pursued at the next meeting of the\r\nWorking Group.\r\nSpeaking of the question of the veto, my delegation\r\nfinds interesting the idea proposed by Germany in the\r\ngeneral debate that perhaps the permanent members should\r\nbe required to explain to the general membership in the\r\nAssembly their negative votes cast in the Council on non-\r\nprocedural matters — that is, their vetoes.\r\nWith respect to the cluster I issues, especially the\r\nexpansion of the Council\u0027s membership, we believe that\r\nprogress or breakthrough depends to a great extent on the\r\npolitical will of States, rather than on the skill of\r\nnegotiators in the Working Group.\r\nThe reform of the Council, which is an important part\r\nof the reform of the United Nations in general, is yet to be\r\nrealized. My delegation believes that all peace-loving States\r\nwould stand to gain from a reform that would strengthen\r\nthe Security Council, making it more open, transparent and\r\nefficient. It is in this spirit that members are making\r\nbusinesslike comments and offering constructive\r\nsuggestions and proposals.\r\nMr. Ryan (Ireland): I wish to thank Ambassador\r\nSergey Lavrov for his presentation of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council in his capacity as President of the Security\r\nCouncil. I also wish to join those who have congratulated\r\nthe Security Council secretariat on the hard work that went\r\ninto the production of the report.\r\nThis agenda item provides the General Assembly with\r\nits annual opportunity to consider the manner in which it is\r\ninformed of how the Security Council has discharged the\r\nresponsibility that the Members of the United Nations have\r\nconferred on it. It is important that in giving their views on\r\nthe report the general membership offer suggestions to the\r\nCouncil for its improvement.\r\nMy delegation wishes to acknowledge that the report\r\nof the Security Council has undergone very significant and\r\nwelcome improvement in recent years. It now provides a\r\nmuch more useful and accurate record of the Council\u0027s\r\nactivities. As a result of the implementation of the Council\u0027s\r\ndecision of June 1997, the report now provides some detail\r\nregarding the informal consultations, at least the occasions\r\non which informal consultations took place, and the topics\r\nof discussion. This is the least we might expect, given that\r\ndecisions of the Council are, for the most part, taken in\r\naccordance with understandings reached in the informal\r\nconsultations.\r\nI am glad to see that the evolution of the report is\r\ncontinuing, with the inclusion this year, for the first time,\r\nof details of the work carried out by the sanctions\r\ncommittees.\r\nI also wish to record our appreciation of the practice,\r\nwhich is becoming more and more systematic, whereby\r\nthe Council presidency offers briefings immediately\r\nfollowing closed consultations. With most of the Council\u0027s\r\nbusiness done behind closed doors, these briefings can\r\nprove invaluable to delegations.\r\nIn spite of these improvements, there is still some\r\nway to go before the report offers a comprehensive and\r\ncoherent account of the Security Council\u0027s activities in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. With the\r\ninclusion of the monthly assessments made by the\r\nsuccessive Presidents of the Council on their own\r\nresponsibility, in the form of an addendum, the reports\r\nhave become more valuable.\r\nThe statements to the press that the President of the\r\nCouncil is authorized to make are a useful addition to the\r\nreport. Of course, to the world at large these statements\r\nto the press are, or certainly should be, of considerable\r\nimportance. They are the means by which the members of\r\nthe Council give the world their collective view regarding\r\na particular issue, and seek to influence the relevant\r\nactors. These statements are the means by which the\r\nCouncil acts on a day-to-day basis, without resorting to\r\nformal measures, in response to threats to international\r\npeace and security. Their value lies also in the analysis\r\nthey offer of the evolution of the Council\u0027s thinking\r\nregarding the issues of which it is seized and, ultimately,\r\nin any assessment of its effectiveness. Yet until they\r\nbegan to appear in the addendum, the only record of them\r\nlay in the media, if the media carried them at all.\r\nHowever, to those unfamiliar with the workings of\r\nthe Security Council, the accounts presented in the report\r\nof its consideration of the various issues of which it is\r\nseized read rather strangely. We are told that informal\r\nconsultations took place on a particular topic, but not\r\nwhat their conclusions were. There is no mention of the\r\nappeals, condemnations, encouragement, et cetera, made\r\nby Council members as a result of these consultations.\r\nMy delegation would urge the Council to take a look at\r\nthis anomaly.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nWe have heard many calls for greater openness and\r\ntransparency in the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, including several from the Irish delegation. More\r\nopenness and transparency is required not just to discharge\r\nthe Council\u0027s duty to keep the membership of the United\r\nNations informed, but also in the interests of its own\r\neffectiveness. It is time for the Council to heed calls for\r\nmore of its day-to-day business to be conducted in formal\r\nsession. For instance, it is difficult to see the justification\r\nfor the fact that Secretariat briefings are given to the\r\nCouncil only at its closed consultations. On 27 August this\r\nyear, we witnessed a welcome departure from this practice,\r\nwhen Under-Secretary-General Prendergast came to the\r\nCouncil, meeting in formal session, and gave a briefing on\r\nthe conflict in Afghanistan. The general membership would\r\nlike to see more such occasions.\r\nNobody wants any constraints placed on the Council\r\nthat would reduce its ability to work effectively. On the\r\ncontrary, the general membership wishes to see a united\r\nand effective Council. But when international law is being\r\nflouted, and when actions are taken which threaten\r\ninternational peace and security, the Council\u0027s hand is likely\r\nto be strengthened, rather than weakened, if the details are\r\nlaid bare in open session and if non-members are able to\r\ngive their views in open debate. The Council meeting of 11\r\nSeptember on East Timor provided a dramatic example of\r\nthis.\r\nWe, the Members of the United Nations, agreed when\r\nwe signed and ratified the Charter that the Security Council\r\nacts on our behalf when carrying out its duties in\r\naccordance with its primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Nowhere\r\ndoes the Charter say that the members of the Security\r\nCouncil may use their position on it in order to act on their\r\nown behalf. It is the duty of the members of the Council to\r\nagree on united action on our behalf in defence of\r\ninternational peace and security. The prospect of division\r\nand of attendant delay and indecisiveness on the part of the\r\nCouncil gives heart to those who would flout international\r\nlaw and undermine international security.\r\nIt is saddening, therefore, that during the period\r\ncovered by this report, there were issues on which the\r\nCouncil was not united and was thus unable to take\r\nnecessary action on our behalf to bring an end to conflict\r\nand suffering.\r\nMy delegation greatly welcomes, therefore, the fact\r\nthat the report before us records consideration by the\r\nCouncil of human security issues, including children and\r\narmed conflict, protection for humanitarian assistance to\r\nrefugees and others in conflict situations, and the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict.\r\nCivilians are the chief sufferers in modern armed\r\nconflict, and it is highly appropriate that the Security\r\nCouncil should hear directly from those charged with\r\ntheir protection. The effects of armed conflict on civilians\r\nmust be an ever-present consideration in the minds of the\r\nmembers of the Council when they address issues of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe report also records consideration of the general\r\nsituation in Africa, as well as a number of decisions and\r\npresidential statements in follow-up to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report of April 1998. No one who reads this or\r\nany recent report of the Security Council can fail to note\r\nthe preponderance of African conflicts, or the fact that\r\nmany of them are of very long duration.\r\nThis has been pointed out time and time again by\r\nAfrican delegations, which might be forgiven for thinking\r\nthat the international community accorded less importance\r\nto problems on their continent than to problems\r\nelsewhere.\r\nAfrican leaders, as well as the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations such\r\nas the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC), are now taking determined action to\r\naddress many of these issues. Such action is essential, but\r\nequally essential is the support of the international\r\ncommunity and, particularly, of the Security Council. It\r\nis the fervent hope of my delegation that the next, and\r\nsubsequent, issues of the report of the Security Council\r\nwill record effective action towards ending these\r\nlongstanding conflicts, and that they will in time fade\r\ncompletely from the agenda.\r\nThis report is a fine document of record. We are\r\nencouraged by the large number of speakers who have\r\nchosen to intervene under this item. We trust that\r\nmembers of the Council, permanent and non-permanent,\r\nwill pay attention to the many ideas and suggestions\r\nwhich have been made so that we can make this report an\r\neven more useful document in both its content and\r\nanalysis.\r\nMr. Pohan (Indonesia): I should like at the outset to\r\ncommend the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Sergey Lavrov of the Russian Federation, for\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nhis lucid introduction of the Security Council\u0027s annual\r\nreport, highlighting, among others, a number of procedural\r\nmeasures adopted by the Council in order to enhance the\r\nefficiency of its work. We remain confident that these\r\nmeasures could constitute a basis upon which to build our\r\nendeavours to further strengthen its efficacy, transparency,\r\naccountability and democratization.\r\nIt is in this light that Indonesia views the current\r\nannual report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly, which as in the past, provides a comprehensive\r\naccount of the Council\u0027s activities during the preceding year\r\nand describes its task in the context of its ever-increasing\r\nresponsibilities. It also contains a compendium of\r\ncommunications and other documents as well as a listing of\r\ndecisions and actions taken on the issues brought before the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThough several issues, encompassing substance as well\r\nas the nature of the Council\u0027s working methods and\r\npractices, still need to be addressed, overall we have seen\r\na substantial number of positive developments in the\r\nCouncil\u0027s deliberations and their outcome. These include an\r\nincrease in the number of open meetings, greater\r\ntransparency in the procedures of the sanctions committees,\r\nand extensive coverage of the work of its subsidiary organs.\r\nWe have also seen an increased flow of information to the\r\nnon-members of the Council on its deliberations and\r\ndecisions, which has obviated the need for the Permanent\r\nMissions to depend on the media. These developments have\r\nbeen further augmented by the briefings offered by the\r\npresidency to the non-members at the conclusion of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s informal consultations. Consequently, the\r\ncredibility of the Council with respect to its functioning and\r\nmodus operandi has seen a relative improvement in its\r\nrelations with the general membership of the Organization.\r\nWe would like to add that non-Council members, as my\r\ndelegation is now, would find most useful in particular the\r\nenhancement of the established practice of announcing in\r\nthe Journal of the United Nations the issues scheduled for\r\nconsideration in the informal consultations under the agenda\r\nitem entitled “Other matters”.\r\nOn the question of sanctions, my delegation recognizes\r\ntheir legitimacy as an instrument of enforcement provided\r\nfor in the Charter. However, since sanctions can cause\r\nenormous suffering, not only for the targeted population but\r\nalso for neighbouring States, we would like to reiterate our\r\noft-stated views, namely, that sanctions should be an\r\ninstrument of last resort and serve specific purposes. They\r\nshould also have clear and specific parameters and time-\r\nframes as well as appropriate review mechanisms, and\r\nthey should be lifted when their objectives have been achieved.\r\nAs a troop-contributing country, Indonesia is also\r\ngratified at the periodic interaction between the Council\r\nand the countries that contribute troops to various\r\npeacekeeping operations. This has led to a greater\r\nappreciation of the problems inherent in such activities,\r\nelicited greater support from Member States and thereby\r\nensured the future viability of such operations —\r\nespecially important at a time when they face new\r\nchallenges and complexities.\r\nConsidering the successes and setbacks registered in\r\npeacekeeping and taking into account the fact that such\r\nactivities have moved beyond the traditional concept and\r\ntaken on a multidimensional aspect, there is an urgent\r\nneed to review, take stock of and draw conclusions from\r\nrecent experiences. It would be more beneficial if this\r\nwere to occur long before a decision is taken by the\r\nCouncil, as it would pave the way for an interactive\r\ndialogue between the representatives of the contributing\r\ncountries and Council members. Furthermore, timely\r\nreimbursement to the contributing countries is essential in\r\nmaintaining and enhancing United Nations operations.\r\nIt is also pertinent to note that the Security Council,\r\nacting on behalf of the Member States and in their\r\ninterests, launches peacekeeping operations under Chapter\r\nVI or Chapter VII, with specific mandates and under its\r\nresponsibility. In order to ensure that a specific\r\npeacekeeping activity is carried out in accordance with\r\nthe provisions of the Charter, including respect for the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States and for\r\nrelevant resolutions, my delegation deems it essential to\r\ncreate a mechanism to monitor and supervise these\r\nactivities, especially with respect to ensuring the integrity\r\nand neutrality of the role of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation has also noted the close cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and various regional\r\norganizations in multifaceted operations, which has been\r\nmutually reinforcing and complementary regarding their\r\nrespective roles and responsibilities. But it should also be\r\nrecognized that because these bodies have specific\r\ncharters, mandates and competences, such cooperation\r\nshould be carried out on the basis of coordination and\r\nconsultation in order to strengthen interaction between\r\nthem.\r\nMy delegation would be remiss if it did not mention\r\none of the Council\u0027s critical problems, which lies in the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nimbalance between the open meetings of the Council, at\r\nwhich it takes formal decisions, and the more frequent use\r\nof informal consultations, at which it actually finalizes its\r\ndecisions. While acknowledging the Council\u0027s right to such\r\nclosed meetings under its provisional rules of procedure —\r\nwhich have been provisional since its inception — we\r\nbelieve that the holding of private meetings, as stipulated in\r\nrule 48, should be the exception rather than the general\r\npractice. A certain balance needs to be established between\r\nthe need for confidentiality in the Council\u0027s consultations\r\nand the interests of transparency vis-à-vis the general\r\nmembership.\r\nIn this regard, we would like to add that in certain\r\nsituations, delegations with a special interest in an issue\r\nunder discussion in the Council — particularly those\r\nrepresenting countries that are involved in conflict or\r\ncountries that are affected by conflict — should have the\r\nopportunity to present their views to the Council at an early\r\nstage in the decision-making process, as provided for under\r\nthe Charter.\r\nIt is clear that the report has fallen short of the\r\nobjectives contained not only in the final documents\r\nadopted at the twelfth Summit of the non-aligned countries\r\nbut also in General Assembly resolution 51/193, which,\r\namong other things, exhorted the Council to provide a\r\nsubstantive and analytical account of its functioning, to\r\ninclude basic information concerning the consultations of\r\nthe whole and to take further steps to improve its working\r\nmethods. We believe that the annual report required under\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter should be more than\r\na mere description of activities and reproduction of\r\nresolutions and decisions that we already know about. In\r\nother words, the report is not a document of substance\r\ncommensurate with the greatly expanded work of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn our view, therefore, the reports of the Council to\r\nthe General Assembly should contain an analysis and an\r\nassessment of the decisions taken by the Council on each\r\nissue in order to meet the need for greater clarity and to\r\nallow a better understanding of its reasoning in adopting\r\ndecisions. The secrecy surrounding its deliberations and the\r\nsubsequent decision-making process, which affects all\r\nnations, is incompatible with the age of informatics. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the recent practice whereby outgoing\r\nPresidents offer a monthly assessment providing a broad\r\noverview of the developments that have taken place.\r\nAlthough such assessments are prepared under their own\r\nresponsibility and in consultation with other members of the\r\nCouncil, we believe that these assessments have the\r\npotential for further improvement and could be more\r\nforthcoming and analytical.\r\nFurthermore, consideration should also be given to\r\nreviewing the Council\u0027s relations with other principal\r\norgans, especially the General Assembly. This has\r\nbecome essential in the context of the Council\u0027s venturing\r\ninto new areas which are within the purview of other\r\nUnited Nations organs and bodies. In this context, we\r\nhold the view that balance is essential in the relationship\r\nbetween the Assembly and the Council, in conformity\r\nwith their respective mandates as enshrined in the\r\nCharter. The Council should have greater accountability\r\nto the Assembly for decisions affecting the interests of the\r\nglobal community of nations. It might also be desirable\r\nfor the Council to submit special reports in order to keep\r\nMembers abreast of its activities and functions, as\r\nmentioned in Article 15 of the Charter.\r\nIn short, my delegation welcomes this year\u0027s annual\r\nreport of the Security Council, which it has provided to\r\nthe General Assembly in fulfilment of its constitutional\r\nrequirement and in accordance with the provisions of\r\nArticle 15 of the Charter. It demonstrates that the Council\r\nhas undertaken to fulfil some of its obligations of\r\naccountability to the Assembly, which represents the\r\nwhole membership of the United Nations, on whose\r\nbehalf the Council undertakes its tasks. However, even\r\nthough by considering the content of the report my\r\ndelegation is surely better informed, the report has not\r\nreached a level such that it could enhance our limited\r\nwisdom.\r\nIn conclusion, since the report of the Security\r\nCouncil is closely linked to the issues of the expansion of\r\nits membership and reform of its working methods and\r\npractices, I would like to reaffirm that my delegation will\r\ncontinue to play an active part in the ongoing\r\ndeliberations of the Open-ended Working Group. Lastly,\r\npermit me to offer our congratulations to the\r\nrepresentatives of Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and\r\nUkraine upon their election to the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council and to wish them\r\nsuccess in the discharge of their responsibilities.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nSeveral years ago, the General Assembly decided, through\r\nits well-known resolution 51/193, to request the Security\r\nCouncil to provide more information and greater clarity\r\nin the presentation of its reports. That resolution stipulated\r\nthat the report should provide information with regard to\r\nthe debates in plenary meetings of the Security Council,\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nthe decisions and recommendations of the subsidiary organs\r\nof the Council, the extent to which General Assembly\r\nresolutions are taken into account in the Council and the\r\nsteps taken to improve the Council\u0027s working methods. I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to thank the members\r\nof the Council for this report. We also welcome the\r\nprogress that has been made with regard to its content.\r\nHowever, since most of the debates and consultations\r\ntake place during informal consultations and not in open\r\nmeetings, notwithstanding article 48 of the Security\r\nCouncil\u0027s provisional rules of procedure, the information\r\nthat we receive is incomplete.\r\nIt is therefore not easy to attempt to assess the work\r\nof the Council from the outside. However, I should like to\r\nmention some elements that seem relevant to us.\r\nOne of the most remarkable international events to\r\ntake place recently was the intervention of the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization in Kosovo. We consider it\r\nunacceptable that a regional defence organization took\r\nmilitary action without the authorization of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThat was undoubtedly one of the Council\u0027s most\r\nserious episodes in recent years. The fact that the Council\r\nlater became involved in activities that led to the resolution\r\nof that heated confrontation in no way diminishes the\r\nseriousness of those events. The United Nations, and in\r\nparticular the Security Council, must carry out a candid and\r\nsufficiently critical examination of what took place. As a\r\ncountry that respects international law, Colombia believes\r\nthat watching over international peace and security is the\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council. The Council\r\nrepresents the Members of the United Nations in carrying\r\nout that task, and agreement among its members is\r\ntherefore an indispensable requirement before actions that\r\ninvolve the use of force are taken. If the threat of the veto\r\nwas in fact the argument that was used for setting the\r\nSecurity Council aside in the case of Kosovo, that is further\r\nproof that that mechanism should not be preserved.\r\nIn another context, there is a perception that the\r\nSecurity Council has lacked effectiveness and failed in its\r\nsense of timing with regard to conflicts such as those that\r\nare currently taking place in the African Continent.\r\nIn conclusion, I should now like to make two\r\ncomments about the new trends in the Security Council.\r\nThe first relates to the practice of holding open meetings\r\nmainly on humanitarian issues. Colombia does not, of\r\ncourse, object to the holding of open meetings in which\r\nStates that are not members of the Security Council have\r\nthe opportunity to participate and to explain their\r\npositions on the issues under consideration by that\r\nimportant United Nations organ. However, we should like\r\nto raise several questions regarding those open debates on\r\nhumanitarian issues, although we can offer no definitive\r\nanswers.\r\nFor example, should the Security Council deal with\r\nhumanitarian issues in a comprehensive manner? If we\r\nrespond in the affirmative to that question, should we then\r\nmodify the roles of the Economic and Social Council and\r\nof the General Assembly to avoid unnecessary duplication\r\nof work, or should we reform the Security Council? If we\r\nrespond in the negative, then we must ask why the\r\nSecurity Council should deal only with some\r\nhumanitarian issues and not with others. Are some types\r\nof human suffering more important than others, and can\r\nwe classify types of suffering according to those that are\r\nof interest to the Security Council and those that are of\r\ninterest to other United Nations bodies? What is the real\r\nadded value of holding open debates in the Security\r\nCouncil instead of in the General Assembly or the\r\nEconomic and Social Council?\r\nIs it right to deprive States that are not members of\r\nthe Security Council of the opportunity to participate in\r\nnegotiating the presidential statements and resolutions that\r\nthe Council adopts on humanitarian topics in general? We\r\nmight also wonder whether the Council\u0027s discussion of\r\nhumanitarian issues responds to a general principle or to\r\nspecific considerations that are not consistent with the\r\nCouncil\u0027s own, and increasing, work.\r\nWe have no clear-cut answers to these questions, but\r\nwe hope that forthright dialogue among Member States\r\nwill help us to find them.\r\nThe second trend I wish briefly to address relates to\r\nhumanitarian intervention. At the end of the millennium,\r\nthe majority of conflicts that claim victims are internal\r\nconflicts. Moreover, as the Secretary-General pointed out\r\nin his report on the work of the Organization (A/54/1),\r\nwe see an evil tendency in such conflicts to disregard\r\nhuman rights and basic principles of international\r\nhumanitarian law. What should the international\r\ncommunity do to respond to these challenges? The\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court will\r\nensure that those responsible for serious human rights\r\nviolations do not go unpunished, but what can we as\r\nStates do to prevent humanitarian crises?\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nThere has been considerable debate on the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General and on his 20 September statement\r\nto the General Assembly. The discussion will continue for\r\nmonths, because countless questions arise. For instance,\r\nunder what conditions should the Security Council decide\r\non humanitarian intervention to avert, prevent or put an end\r\nto a humanitarian crisis? And once a crisis has captured the\r\nattention of Council members, particularly permanent\r\nmembers, what should be the conditions for real action, not\r\nmere rhetoric? Who should decide whether a humanitarian\r\ncrisis poses a threat to international peace and security? Are\r\nwe setting the precedent, for example, for future ecological\r\nor social intervention?\r\nFinally, the report\u0027s description of the work of the\r\nSecurity Council is not entirely satisfactory. The Council\u0027s\r\nactual methods of work prevent the rest of the membership\r\nof the Assembly from having full knowledge of its debates\r\nand decisions. We therefore reaffirm that the debate on\r\nSecurity Council reform must go beyond consideration of\r\nthe Council\u0027s composition and should encompass\r\nimprovement of its methods of work. Moreover, we, the\r\nMembers of the United Nations, should reflect on the\r\nmandate we wish to give to the Security Council so that it\r\ncan truly address the new realities that threaten international\r\npeace and security.\r\nMr. Qin Huasun (China) (spoke in Chinese): The\r\nChinese delegation wishes to thank the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for introducing to the General Assembly\r\nthe annual report of the Security Council for the period\r\n1998-1999. The report comprehensively and honestly\r\nreflects the work of the Security Council in the last year of\r\nthis millennium.\r\nThe past year has been eventful. We have seen\r\nunprecedented turbulence and chaos in the international\r\nsituation, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\r\nIraq and from Kosovo to East Timor. These international\r\nvicissitudes have put the role and authority of the Security\r\nCouncil to the test as never before. At the turn of the\r\ncentury, faced with long-standing old problems and with the\r\nnumerous new problems that keep cropping up, how will\r\nthe Security Council best represent the will of all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations, most meaningfully and\r\neffectively carry out its responsibilities as enshrined in the\r\nCharter and contribute to the establishment of a fair and\r\nreasonable new international order? This is a thought-\r\nprovoking issue that has been the topic of heated debate.\r\nThe Chinese delegation would like to make the following\r\nobservations in that regard.\r\nFirst, on “humanitarian intervention”, the end of the\r\ncold war has not brought peace to the world as expected.\r\nConflicts and disputes triggered by poverty and by\r\nterritorial, religious and ethnic problems continue to arise,\r\none after another. Interference and intervention by outside\r\nforces have further complicated and worsened conflicts.\r\nFreedom, democracy and human rights are trampled in\r\nconflicts and wars, and even the most fundamental rights\r\nto subsistence and development cannot be guaranteed.\r\nInnocent civilians are being bombed, killed or displaced.\r\nTens of thousands of refugees have lost their homes and\r\ntheir loved ones. The Chinese nation has a time-honoured\r\ntradition of respecting human dignity and the value of the\r\nhuman being. We have an old saying in China: “Nothing\r\nbetween the sky and the earth is more precious than\r\nhuman beings; benevolence is not benevolence if it does\r\nnot treasure human life”. We are disheartened and\r\nconcerned to see humanitarian crises around the world.\r\nWe do not think the international community is justified\r\nin sitting back and doing nothing.\r\nAccording to the Charter of the United Nations, the\r\nSecurity Council is entrusted with primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe believe that only the Security Council can decide\r\nwhether a given development is a threat to peace and\r\nsecurity, and only the Security Council can decide how\r\nand when to intervene and who should do it. The mandate\r\nto intervene does not lie with any individual country or\r\nmilitary grouping, for these can represent only their own\r\nwill and cannot claim to act in the name of the\r\ninternational community. The United Nations represents\r\nthe will of the international community. Only within the\r\nframework of the United Nations can small and weak\r\ncountries have a sense of security, can their rights and\r\ninterests be safeguarded and can hegemonism and power\r\npolitics be checked. Even when intervention becomes\r\nnecessary for humanitarian reasons, the ultimate result\r\nshould be the easing of conflicts and disputes, not their\r\nintensification. The war in Kosovo was just one hard and\r\ncostly lesson in this connection. In the absence of\r\nSecurity Council authorization and in the name of\r\nhumanitarianism, a regional military organization mounted\r\na large-scale military intervention against a sovereign\r\nState. The intervention resulted in the intensification of\r\nthe conflict and the biggest humanitarian disaster in post-\r\nSecond-World-War Europe. Such “humanitarian”\r\nintervention should not and cannot be allowed to happen\r\nagain.\r\nSecondly, on sanctions, it is easy to impose\r\nsanctions but difficult to lift them. This is a long-standing\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nproblem. The situation has not improved a great deal,\r\ndespite numerous rounds of discussions in the Council and\r\ndespite the fact that a resolution on this matter was adopted\r\nby the General Assembly four years ago. Sanctions against\r\nIraq have been in place for more than nine years now,\r\ncausing human disasters and bringing untold suffering to\r\ntens of thousands of civilians, especially women and\r\nchildren. Not long ago the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) issued a detailed report on the rapidly\r\ndeteriorating health conditions of Iraqi children and the\r\npotentially severe consequences resulting from the\r\nsanctions.\r\nThe facts and figures in the report are shocking. How\r\ncan anybody who remains indifferent to such human\r\ntragedy have the luxury to talk about humanitarianism or\r\nhumanitarian intervention? We Chinese often say that it is\r\nnot too late to mend the fold even after the sheep is lost. If\r\nmistakes were not entirely avoided in the first place, then\r\nat least we should have the courage and ability to correct\r\nthem. The Security Council should immediately lift or\r\nsuspend sanctions against Iraq. More important, we should\r\nlearn a lesson here and be extremely cautious in deciding\r\nto impose sanctions in the future. What is more, we should\r\nclearly define the goal, scope and time-frame of the\r\nsanctions.\r\nThirdly, on Africa, the international community has\r\nresponded enthusiastically to the Secretary-General\u0027s report\r\n(S/1998/318), presented in April 1998, on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. There have also been calls on the\r\nSecurity Council to pay more attention and allocate more\r\ninput to African issues. Over the past year or so we have\r\nseen some positive developments on the African continent,\r\nbut the road towards realizing lasting peace and\r\ndevelopment is still long and arduous. This is a result not\r\nonly of deep-rooted internal factors in conflict areas, but\r\nalso of external factors like the political will of the\r\ninternational community and the financial resources it is\r\nwilling to commit. We have always believed that peace and\r\ndevelopment around the world are interrelated. The Charter\r\nof the United Nations is applicable to all regions of the\r\nworld. African people should be able to enjoy the peace\r\nand development that the people of other regions are\r\nenjoying. For this to happen, the Security Council needs to\r\npour into the African continent the same amount of effort\r\nas, if not more than, it gives to other regions.\r\nThe Security Council had an open debate on the\r\nsituation in Africa not long ago. During the discussions the\r\nSecretary-General and various Member States put forward\r\na number of feasible suggestions. We welcome them, and\r\nhope that the various sides will continue to offer\r\ncooperation and support so that the promises the Council\r\nhas made to Africa are implemented. Only if the Council\r\nchanges its past pattern of producing more words than\r\ndeeds, and stops using double standards, can the African\r\ncountries\u0027 confidence and trust in the Council remain\r\nintact.\r\nFourthly, on improving the transparency and\r\nefficiency of the work of the Council, Council members\r\nrepresent the entire United Nations membership. The\r\nCouncil has the responsibility to act upon the will of all\r\nMember States and is also obligated to let Member States\r\nhave full and easy access to information regarding its\r\nwork. We support more communication between the\r\nCouncil and non-Council members as well as more\r\ntransparency in the Council\u0027s work. The recent practice of\r\nCouncil Presidents briefing non-Council members after\r\ninformal consultations should be extended to other\r\nCouncil activities.\r\nMoreover, China supports constant adjustment and\r\nimprovement of the Council\u0027s working methods to make\r\nit function even more efficiently and better perform its\r\nduties. Most recently, on the issue of East Timor, the\r\nmission sent by the Council to Indonesia achieved the\r\nexpected results. We believe that the Council should\r\ncontinue to try peace-promoting measures that it deems\r\neffective.\r\nWith the dawning of the new century and new\r\nmillennium, the Security Council is faced with new\r\nchallenges and new opportunities. It needs the support of\r\nits members as well as of all Member States. Only with\r\nsuch support can it carry out effectively the lofty missions\r\nentrusted to it by the Charter. Safeguarding the authority\r\nof the Council is in the interest of all Member States. We\r\nhope that the various sides will continue to strive in this\r\ndirection.\r\nMr. Martynov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus has carefully\r\nstudied the report of the Security Council presented to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Our\r\ndelegation is grateful to the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, for having presented\r\nthe report today.\r\nWe consider this agenda item to be, first, an\r\nopportunity to add more transparency to the work of one\r\nof the principal United Nations organs responsible for the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and an\r\nopportunity for open discussion by all Member States.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus notes with satisfaction that\r\nthe positive dynamics of last year\u0027s report remain in this\r\nyear\u0027s document. First, the report reflects the contents of\r\nunofficial consultations and gives information on briefings\r\nof the Council on the principal items of its agenda.\r\nParticular attention should be paid to the background\r\ninformation sections, which give a general picture of the\r\ndynamics of the Council\u0027s decision-making process on\r\nquestions of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nBelarus welcomes the development of the practice of\r\nmonthly summaries being given by Presidents of the\r\nSecurity Council following the completion of their\r\nmandates. Through this practice, we believe, new ways\r\ncould be found to enhance the analytic level of information\r\non the Council\u0027s work and to present a balanced evaluation\r\nfor non-Council members of the results of that work.\r\nA very important step in making the Council more\r\nadaptive to the challenges it faces today is the decision to\r\ninclude in the document the reports of the sanctions\r\ncommittees, which until very recently were absolutely\r\ninaccessible for the majority of United Nations Member\r\nStates. That was clearly unacceptable.\r\nAll those positive changes should, in our view, be\r\nconsolidated in the Council\u0027s working practices and further\r\ndeveloped every year.\r\nBelarus regards the process of increasing transparency\r\nand openness, both of the substantive part of the report and\r\nthe Council\u0027s working methods, as one of the most\r\nimportant trends. Although a number of innovations have\r\nbeen approved, we very much regret that most informal\r\nconsultations of the Council remain closed to most United\r\nNations Members.\r\nIn addition, unfortunately, the Council members have\r\nnot yet devoted significant attention to the analytical part of\r\nthe report. It is obvious to all that a simple record of the\r\nresolutions adopted by the Council and an absolutely\r\nneutral evaluation of the results of its monthly activities\r\ncannot create a reliable basis for extensive dialogue\r\nbetween the Council and non-members of the Council. We\r\nare convinced that this discussion must be two-sided and\r\nbased on a comprehensive assessment of the adequacy\r\nand effectiveness of the various decisions taken by the\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe cannot consider the report of the Security\r\nCouncil without also bearing in mind the general context\r\nof the role and place of that organ in today\u0027s world and\r\nwithin the United Nations system. Belarus, as one of the\r\nfounding States Members of the United Nations and as a\r\nparticipant in the preparation of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, has strongly and consistently supported the\r\nprinciple of the Security Council\u0027s playing the foremost\r\nrole in decision-making on issues related to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This\r\nprovision of the Charter should be respected by all\r\nMember States regardless of their circumstances or\r\npolitical status. The recent cases in which the Security\r\nCouncil was left out of decision-making processes have\r\nhad a serious effect on international peace and security.\r\nThey provoked deep concern in the Republic of Belarus.\r\nWe made it very clear at the Security Council meeting of\r\n24 March that this approach was not acceptable.\r\nGiven the current global climate, it is also imperative\r\nthat the Council take a much more forward-looking and\r\npreventive approach. The work of the Council to date by\r\nno means fully responds to this need.\r\nRecent events have made it perfectly clear that there\r\nis an urgent need for the reform of that most important\r\nbody of our Organization and for its adaptation to the\r\nnew global realities. Security Council reform is, in our\r\nview, an absolute imperative for our work. On it depends\r\nthe future viability of our unique forum — not only the\r\nviability of the Security Council but that of the entire\r\nUnited Nations and the effectiveness of the entire\r\nuniversal mechanism of collective security and\r\nmultilateral diplomacy. We believe that maximum\r\ntransparency and the appropriate geographic\r\nrepresentation of the Member States of the Organization\r\nare the key aspects of the discussion on how to reform\r\nthe Council that is taking place within the framework of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group established by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nBelarus does not suppose that all these problems can\r\nbe resolved instantaneously. We are convinced, however,\r\nthat the consideration of all aspects related to the\r\nimprovement of the work of the Council should be given\r\nnew impetus.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nBelarus is ready to participate actively in this process.\r\nThe Government of my country has decided to present our\r\ncandidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Council at the\r\nelections to be held in 2001. This is a clear indication of\r\nthe unconditional priority that Belarus attaches to questions\r\nrelated to the future of the Security Council and to all of\r\nthe work involved in determining the ways and means of\r\nmaking the Council more effective in the new century.\r\nMr. Čalovski (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): The Security Council was the busiest organ of\r\nour Organization during the reporting period. It both acted\r\nas an executive organ and continued to examine and discuss\r\nsome issues as a deliberative body. It took many important\r\ndecisions, and it is clear that for some time it will remain\r\nthe organ of our Organization in charge of the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nMy delegation has maintained useful and cooperative\r\nrelations with all Council members, be they permanent or\r\nnon-permanent. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress to each of them the satisfaction of the Republic of\r\nMacedonia for the cooperation extended to my delegation.\r\nWe appreciate the statement of the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the month of October, the\r\nrepresentative of the Russian Federation. It was informative\r\nand well thought out, and therefore helpful to the members\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nIn its work the Council was, inter alia, engaged in two\r\nsubjects, both extremely important for the peace, security\r\nand development of our region and for my country, the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia, as is well known, was the\r\nhost of the first, and so far the only, preventive United\r\nNations peacekeeping mission: the United Nations\r\nPreventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), which was\r\nestablished in late 1992 and ended its work in February this\r\nyear. Taking into account the situation in the region, the\r\nSecurity Council extended the mandate of the mission\r\nseveral times. The mission was praised as an important\r\nsuccess for the United Nations and the Republic of\r\nMacedonia. However, the last request for a further\r\nextension, in February of this year, by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and by my Government, was not approved. In spite\r\nof Article 24 of the Charter of the United Nations, which\r\nrequests the Council to act on behalf of the Member States,\r\none permanent member of the Council voted against the\r\ndraft resolution, which had been proposed by many Council\r\nmembers.\r\nThe inaction of the Council came at the worst\r\nmoment, just before the beginning of the Kosovo war, a\r\nwar which everybody knew was coming. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the members of the Council were not\r\nsuccessful in their efforts to reverse the negative decision,\r\nor the indecision, regarding UNPREDEP, and so this\r\nsuccess story of the United Nations ended regrettably.\r\nThat was a disappointing moment in the Council\u0027s\r\nwork. It had a negative impact on the situation in the\r\nregion. I hope that similar action, or inaction, by the\r\nCouncil will be avoided in the future.\r\nSoon after this inaction, the Council had before it the\r\nKosovo crisis, the war, the refugees, the danger of a\r\nwider war and so on. Regrettably, the positions of the\r\npermanent members of the Council were at variance and\r\nthe Council could act neither to prevent the conflict as it\r\napproached nor to settle it when it had begun. Because of\r\nthis and the magnitude of the Kosovo crisis, the situation\r\nwas handled, appropriately, by factors outside the\r\nCouncil. Later, the Council became involved and adopted\r\nresolution 1244 (1999).\r\nThe full implementation of resolution 1244 (1999),\r\nwhich established the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) is of\r\nparamount importance for the peace, security and\r\ndevelopment of the Balkans, South-East Europe and\r\nEurope as a whole, and, I would add, globally. The\r\ninvolvement, non-involvement or partial involvement of\r\nthe Security Council in the Kosovo conflict initiated a\r\nbroad discussion of the relevance of the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter, particularly the principles of the\r\nsovereign equality of States and of non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs, the issue of humanitarian intervention and\r\nthe role of the General Assembly in matters of peace and\r\nsecurity. This discussion is continuing.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that human rights must\r\nbe observed and protected and that the international\r\ncommunity cannot remain indifferent to massive violation\r\nof human rights. Anybody\u0027s help to prevent the violation\r\nof human rights or armed conflict should be welcomed.\r\nThe legal ground for action is the United Nations Charter\r\nand international law, particularly international\r\nhumanitarian law, the law of refugees and political, civil,\r\neconomic, social and cultural human rights law.\r\nThe organs of our Organization mandated to\r\ndeliberate and act on such issues are the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and, of course, the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nEconomic and Social Council. In our view, it is not wise to\r\nconcentrate everything in the Security Council and to allow\r\nthe General Assembly to be ignored or marginalized. Both,\r\nalong with the Economic and Social Council, should be\r\ninvolved and all Member States should be given the chance\r\nto advance their views and help. In this regard, I consider\r\npertinent the questions raised in the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Colombia, who spoke earlier today.\r\nIt is important to start this process. Instead of once a\r\nyear, the Security Council could report to the General\r\nAssembly on its work every quarter. We do not need to\r\nwait one year to hear about the Security Council\u0027s work.\r\nThe Secretary-General could advance this process by\r\nreporting to the General Assembly every quarter on the\r\nwork of the Organization and by using those occasions to\r\nmake suggestions for action by our Organization. If these\r\nor similar proposals to the Security Council and to the\r\nSecretary-General were taken up, the work of the General\r\nAssembly would be energized. That would be to the benefit\r\nof the purposes of our Organization and its Member States.\r\nAs members know, the Security Council, its present\r\nwork and future role have been the subjects of many\r\ndiscussions, formal and informal, for some years now. And\r\nthey will continue. The crucial thing is adherence to the\r\nprovisions of the Charter, in particular to Articles 24 and\r\n27. If the Council members were to adhere to these\r\nArticles, then all other issues — such as the enlargement of\r\nits membership and the democratization and transparency of\r\nits work — would acquire different dimensions. Parallel to\r\nthis, it is essential that the General Assembly start to work\r\nin accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter, by\r\nwhich the General Assembly is entrusted to consider any\r\nquestions or any matters, including the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and to make\r\nrecommendations to the Member States and to the Security\r\nCouncil. To start to perform its tasks under the Charter, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should start to work all year round, not\r\nonly one or two months.\r\nNext year, the Millennium Summit and the\r\nMillennium Assembly of the United Nations will be the\r\nright occasions for our Organization to finally abandon the\r\nperiod of confrontation and to enter a period of cooperation,\r\nintegration and equality, and to stop retrogressive forces\r\nand enhance the forces of cooperation based on mutual\r\nrespect. Only then will our Organization be an Organization\r\nof equal rights of nations, large and small, and truly a\r\ncentre for harmonizing the actions of nations towards the\r\nattainment of common ends, as required by the Charter.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, allow me to convey our thanks to the permanent\r\nrepresentative of the Russian Federation, President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the current month, for his concise\r\npresentation of the annual report of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly. I wish also to commend him for\r\nthe efficient manner in which he is steering the work of\r\nthe Council and which demonstrates his deep perception\r\nand sense of responsibility vis-à-vis the functions\r\nentrusted to the Council.\r\nMy delegation has carefully examined the contents\r\nof the fifty-fourth annual report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly, submitted under Article 15 of the\r\nCharter. The report underlines the close relationship\r\nbetween the Council and the Assembly and the\r\nimportance of that relationship, especially in ensuring\r\npeace and security for the human race. My delegation\r\nviews the report in question as yet another link in the\r\nchain that binds the two organs. This report provides an\r\nopportunity to all States Members of the United Nations\r\nto express their views and aspirations regarding the work\r\nof the Security Council, one of the main organs that\r\nconstitute the backbone of the United Nations system.\r\nHaving said that, my delegation wishes to stress\r\nKuwait\u0027s firm belief in the absolute importance of the\r\nSecurity Council as a mechanism that embodies the\r\ncollective position of the international community on\r\ncritical issues that can affect the fate of nations. The most\r\nprominent example to us in Kuwait was the action taken\r\nby the Security Council, with international support, to\r\nstop Iraqi aggression against the State of Kuwait in 1990.\r\nThe Council continues to fulfil its role of maintaining\r\nsecurity and stability in Kuwait in particular, and in the\r\nArab Gulf region in general.\r\nHaving reviewed the report of the Security Council,\r\nKuwait is drawn in particular to two subjects that are of\r\nspecial interest to us, on the basis of our continuing\r\ninterest in the work of the Council.\r\nFirst, over the past several years, my delegation has\r\ncarefully followed the statements on previous reports\r\nmade by Member States that focused on the Council\u0027s\r\nperformance and the need to reform its structure. There\r\nhave also been calls demanding improvement of the\r\nreport\u0027s format, with a view to enhancing its analysis of\r\nthe Council\u0027s achievements and its deliberations on\r\nimportant international issues. However, my delegation\r\nwill have an opportunity to express its views in detail on\r\nthe reform and expansion of the Council when we speak\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nunder agenda item 38, “Question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security Council\r\nand related matters”.\r\nSpeaking substantively on the content of the report\r\nbefore us today, we note with satisfaction the efforts made\r\nto introduce improvements and to expand the analytical\r\ndimension of the report. This includes personal assessments\r\nof the work of the Council by the representatives who had\r\njust completed their mandate as President of the Council\r\nduring the period covered by the report, pursuant to General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/193. Kuwait feels that we should\r\nencourage Council members to maintain this approach. We\r\nalso associate ourselves with other States that have insisted\r\nit is important and advisable to enhance the analytical\r\naspect of the report.\r\nSecondly, regarding the deliberations and efforts of the\r\nSecurity Council in its follow-up of the Iraq-Kuwait\r\nsituation, my delegation wishes to express Kuwait\u0027s\r\nappreciation to the Security Council for its adoption early\r\nthis month of the Secretary-General\u0027s recommendation to\r\nrenew the mandate of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\r\nObservation Mission (UNIKOM), which operates along the\r\nborder between Kuwait and Iraq, pursuant to Security\r\nCouncil resolution 689 (1991).\r\nIn addition, my delegation wishes to refer to a point\r\nmade in the note by the President of the Security Council\r\n(S/1999/100), under the item entitled “The situation\r\nbetween Iraq and Kuwait”, concerning the decision by the\r\nCouncil to establish three separate panels to evaluate Iraq\u0027s\r\ncompliance in three major areas: the elimination of Iraqi\r\nweapons of mass destruction, the humanitarian situation in\r\nIraq and the questions of Kuwaiti prisoners and the return\r\nof Kuwaiti property. The Council reviewed the report and\r\nrecommendations of the Chairman of the three panels,\r\nwhich are also cited in the Council\u0027s report. Since last\r\nMarch, the Council has been engaged in detailed and\r\nintensive consultations with a view to adopting a resolution\r\non the recommendations of the panels. Kuwait attaches\r\ngreat importance to all three matters.\r\nIn this regard, Kuwait supports the efforts of all\r\nmembers of the Council, especially the five permanent\r\nmembers, who have been working strenuously to reach\r\nconsensus on these recommendations. Kuwait wishes to\r\nstress the importance of maintaining the unity of the\r\nSecurity Council in dealing with this issue, which we hope\r\nwill adopt a resolution reflecting such unity. Not only\r\nwould this ensure full compliance by Iraq, but would also\r\nlend greater effectiveness and legitimacy to previous\r\nCouncil resolutions in this regard.\r\nGiven the sensitive nature of issues examined by the\r\nSecurity Council, in the context of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, my delegation fully\r\nunderstands the reasons that prompt the frequent holding\r\nof closed, informal meetings by the Security Council to\r\ndiscuss these issues. In such settings, Council members\r\nhave greater latitude to express their views freely, without\r\nneglecting the need to consult closely with the parties\r\ndirectly concerned. My delegation also fully appreciates\r\nthe reasons for this methodology. At the same time, we\r\nencourage the Security Council to increase the number of\r\nopen meetings, as has been the case recently, in order to\r\ndiscuss extremely important international questions. Good\r\nexamples are the open debates on the causes of conflict\r\nin Africa, on the protection of civilians in time of war\r\nand, most recently, on responsibility of the Security\r\nCouncil for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. In our view, this is a positive trend that we hope\r\nwill continue. I wish to commend all the members of the\r\nSecurity Council for their cooperation and their efforts to\r\npractise transparency and to provide useful information to\r\nnon-member States. We urge them to continue on this\r\npositive track.\r\nFinally, my delegation hopes that members of the\r\nSecurity Council will react to the views and criticism of\r\nnon-member States with patience and sympathetic\r\nunderstanding, especially since these views, in the final\r\nanalysis, contribute to the common interest and reflect the\r\ndesire of Member States to improve the working methods\r\nof the Council, which we believe is the safety valve for\r\nworld peace and stability. Furthermore, Kuwait, a non-\r\nmember of the Security Council, calls for the provision of\r\nadequate support to Council members, with a view to\r\nhelping them seek solutions and measures that meet the\r\nfundamental goal of our Organization: the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We must always bear in\r\nmind the difference in perception between the observer\r\nand the active player. The latter bears a more difficult and\r\nheavier responsibility.\r\nMr. Sadauskas (Lithuania): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of Mr. Oskaras Jusys, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Lithuania to the United Nations.\r\nAs we bid farewell to the most tumultuous century\r\nin human history, the recollection of actions taken or\r\nevaded by the Security Council reflects modern history.\r\nThe report of the Security Council (A/54/2) demonstrates\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nthat the cold war did not wither away but rather burst into\r\nsmaller conflicts all over the globe. The number of lives\r\nlost and shattered by local conflicts is not diminishing.\r\nConflicts are even less manageable than the danger of a\r\nglobal war. The reason for such a situation is widely\r\nacknowledged: the nature of crises has changed; most of\r\ntoday\u0027s conflicts take place within States and not between\r\nthem.\r\nThe principles of State sovereignty and\r\nnon-interference, as well as the uneven fragmentation of the\r\ninterests of States with the capacity to stop such conflicts,\r\nhave begun to play into the hands of war and against peace.\r\nA glimpse of a world map displaying conflicts presents a\r\ngrim picture and guarantees that the Security Council will\r\nremain as busy as ever.\r\nFor instance, the situation in Angola is appalling. A\r\nlarge part of the country has been made uninhabitable. It\r\ndid not take weapons of mass destruction to do this. Mere\r\nignorance of the obvious fact that there would be no\r\nwinners, coupled with an uncontrolled arms flow and an\r\nineffective international sanctions regime, were sufficient.\r\nAs a result, massive famine and disease kill thousands and\r\nthreaten millions.\r\nThe shadow cast by conflict in the Great Lakes region\r\nof Africa was lightened by a glimmer of hope after the\r\nLusaka Accords were reached. Yet awareness of the causes\r\nof the enormous chaos in the heart of Africa, and the\r\nnecessity to bring peace to the region, reveal the\r\nextraordinary efforts needed there. It will be the most\r\nserious challenge for the Security Council in the years to\r\ncome.\r\nNo brighter day is dawning in Afghanistan. There is\r\nno agreement between major international players on how\r\nto end the destruction of what remains of that country, let\r\nalone achieve peace between the warring sides themselves.\r\nKashmir has earned the reputation that it will be the\r\nlast burning place on earth. The possession of nuclear\r\ncapabilities by both India and Pakistan threatens more than\r\njust mutual destruction. What was to be the subject of\r\ncivilized negotiations turned out instead to be a fresh round\r\nof nuclear proliferation — the scourge we had recently\r\nthought to be on the brink of elimination.\r\nChaos in Somalia has led to a situation in which\r\nvirtually no State exists any more. After the failed peace\r\nenforcement attempt, neither the Security Council nor\r\nanybody else has offered a solution for the Horn of Africa.\r\nThe latest blow was Timor. It is clear now that the\r\nbelatedness of international intervention was, in part, to\r\nblame for the heavy loss of life.\r\nOne could go on and on with such examples. In\r\nspite of this pessimistic depiction, however, there have\r\nbeen some positive signs in international peace-making.\r\nEritrea and Ethiopia seem to have realized the\r\npointlessness of their war, which cost so much and solved\r\nnothing; they are embarking on acceptable methods of\r\nresolving differences. The Central African Republic and\r\nthe Western Sahara are also on a winding, but firm, path\r\nto peace. Be it painstaking and slow, the Middle East\r\npeace process is still making headway.\r\nThe most outstanding example of conflict resolution\r\nfor us is Kosovo. Genocide in the old continent, after\r\nsufficient disgrace in Srebenica, was incomprehensible.\r\nFive years down the road it struck again, despite the\r\neuphoria of slogans about a united and peaceful Europe.\r\nThe five-digit number of people slaughtered in two\r\nmonths was symptomatic of flaws in the current\r\ninternational security system. The Kosovo crisis and its\r\nresolution, or, rather, attempted resolution, have given rise\r\nto fundamental discussions about the role and capability\r\nof the United Nations, and in particular the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nClaims about the lack of an explicit mandate from\r\nthe Security Council for military action in Kosovo, which\r\nis part of the sovereign Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\r\nhold water. It may be just a fact of life. When evidence\r\nof the brutal murder of helpless people seeped through\r\ninternational borders, the emerging dilemma for the\r\ninternational community became a moral one: a choice\r\nbetween the sanctity of human lives and strict\r\ninternational standards. Nobody should have been\r\nconfronted with this dilemma in the first place. But once\r\nit happened the reasoning behind the subsequent proactive\r\nchoice went like this: improvement of the international\r\nsystem, however urgent, could wait, while threatened lives\r\ncould not. The Kosovo lesson should not have cost so\r\nmany innocent lives.\r\nA similar lesson was simultaneously taught to us in\r\nSierra Leone. Devastated by a most brutal civil war, its\r\npeople decided that saving precious human lives should\r\nprevail, even at the cost of potential impunity for those\r\nguilty of the most horrific atrocities. But for the virtual\r\nabsence of efficient international support, we might not be\r\nreading today in the press about an unforgettable, sad\r\nadmission by many Sierra Leoneans that, for the sake of\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nsaving lives, they were prepared to forget, but not to\r\nforgive, the nightmares they were put through.\r\nConflicts that start inside a country threaten\r\nneighbours and regions. Attention to conflicts, whether\r\ninternal or external, is thus all but legitimate. There is a\r\nuniversal principle of non-interference and State\r\nsovereignty. But there are other universal principles\r\nunderlying international relations, including respect for\r\nhuman rights. The principle of non-interference is universal,\r\nbut not absolute. Abuse of this principle in countries with\r\ninternal tensions is like an illness which, if untreated, may\r\ndevelop into a contagion-carrying threat to others.\r\nThe principle of non-interference in a State’s affairs is\r\nlosing its protective role for other reasons as well.\r\nInternational relations are increasingly based on something\r\nelse, more human, more reasonable and more progressive\r\nthan the divinity of the principle of State sovereignty.\r\nEqually important is the supremacy of a human being over\r\nthe State. The cases of Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra\r\nLeone are the best testimony to this reality. States do not\r\nown individuals, whether their own citizens or not. States\r\ncannot do whatever they please with individuals within their\r\njurisdiction. New tones in international relations tend to\r\njustify involvement from the outside to stop flagrant\r\nviolations of human rights. Acknowledging that violations\r\nof human rights are often the main cause of conflict, with\r\nknock-on effects, strengthens this principle.\r\nThe newly evolving concept of humanitarian\r\nintervention is a real fact now. It has already taken place in\r\npractice, and is likely to be repeated. The concept lags\r\nbehind reality, and has aroused controversy, which could\r\nhave been avoided had a consensus been worked out by\r\nUnited Nations Member States beforehand. Since\r\nhumanitarian intervention — and who knows what other\r\nkinds of intervention are yet to catch us off guard? — sets\r\nin motion profound thinking on the principles of\r\nnon-interference and sovereignty, there is an obvious need\r\nto establish rules legitimizing such interventions, as well as\r\nmechanisms to uphold such rules.\r\nIt is probable that State borders and sovereignty will\r\ngradually lose their significance in the next century. It has\r\nalready happened in economics, with the rise of\r\nmultinational corporations. It is also bound to happen in\r\ninternational politics, thus opening life within States to\r\nscrutiny from the outside. This means a growing role for\r\nregional and global intergovernmental institutions, including\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council, which is already equipped\r\nwith strong legal powers, is likely to be at the centre of\r\nthe most important decisions. It is essential for the\r\nCouncil to understand, embrace and exploit this trend. In\r\norder to be able to adapt to a new philosophy of\r\ninternational relations, the Security Council itself has to\r\nbe transformed. The discussions on reform of the Council\r\nhave even pre-empted the escalated debate on State\r\nsovereignty vis-à-vis other founding principles of inter-\r\nState relations. Now that we have a newly evolving\r\nfoundation of international politics, reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is all the more urgent.\r\nThe Council is too small to reflect the diversity of\r\nnations. It is a paradox that, for instance, two thirds of the\r\nCouncil’s agenda is about Africa, which is so grossly\r\nunder-represented in the body which decides the\r\ncontinent’s fate. It is, however, less of a paradox when\r\nthe under-representation of Africa allows the Council to\r\nshun its responsibilities to that continent. Rwanda was the\r\nmost horrible example. We therefore fully concur with the\r\ncalls voiced in the General Assembly general debate, in\r\nparticular by the Presidents of Namibia and Nigeria, to\r\ngive Africa sufficient and legitimate representation on the\r\nCouncil.\r\nHaving a greater number of members on the Security\r\nCouncil would enrich it intellectually and in terms of\r\nthose members’ knowledge of their own regions, and thus\r\noffer better means to confront challenges. A bigger\r\nCouncil would also mean greater openness of its work.\r\nThe secrecy surrounding informal consultations is less and\r\nless convincing in terms of confidentiality needed for\r\ndecision-making and there is increasingly more reason for\r\nsuspicion that some Council members are either reluctant\r\nto disclose their methods of solving conflicts or — just as\r\nbad — conceal the absence of solutions.\r\nWe therefore commend a number of open meetings\r\nthat were held in the last 12 months. Such meetings\r\nshould be held even more often, and should concentrate\r\non specific conflicts rather than theoretical subjects, be\r\nmore action-oriented, less sterile and bear less\r\nresemblance to General Assembly debates. Open meetings\r\ndo not, however, exempt the Council from its duty to\r\ninstitutionalize greater transparency of its proceedings.\r\nAs in previous years, we have not been convinced\r\nthat the veto power has helped the Council to discharge\r\nits duties under the Charter, let alone achieve the goals of\r\nconflict prevention and management. The veto is as\r\nundemocratic and controversial as ever, and its use needs\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nto be limited. It would be best to achieve such a curtailment\r\nthrough comprehensive decisions on Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nWe thank the five outgoing members for their diligent\r\nwork during their term, and extend best wishes to the\r\nincoming members in carrying out their difficult tasks. We\r\nalso ask all members of the Council to remain mindful of\r\nthe fact that the Council\u0027s moral authority depends on its\r\noverall performance. We have great confidence that that\r\nauthority will grow.\r\nMs. Wensley (Australia): As all members know,\r\nAustralia has a long-standing interest in this important\r\nagenda item. We believe that the Security Council, as the\r\norgan of the United Nations which has primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, is in many ways the key to ensuring that the\r\nUnited Nations remains relevant to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nDiscussion on the report of the Security Council\r\nprovides an opportunity — another opportunity — for\r\nMember States to reflect upon the importance of the\r\nCouncil, its role and how its efficiency and effectiveness\r\nmay be further enhanced.\r\nAs is very evident from the report, the past year has\r\nbeen a challenging one for the Security Council, due to the\r\nsignificant increase in the number and the scale of\r\npeacekeeping operations and the crises in Kosovo and East\r\nTimor. It has thus become even more critical for the\r\nSecurity Council to reform and to revitalize itself in order\r\nto be able to respond swiftly and adequately to the renewed\r\npressures upon it.\r\nWorking methods are one area in which Australia feels\r\nthat the Council is in particular need of reform.\r\nThe Council\u0027s working methods continue, in our view,\r\nto be too rigid and exclusionary. A number of Member\r\nStates have drawn attention to circumstances where their\r\nown interests are directly affected by an issue under\r\ndiscussion and yet they are excluded from informal\r\nconsultations of the Council. Their only opportunities for\r\nfull participation are in the highly formalized environment\r\nof formal meetings.\r\nAustralia is, as always, very practical. We do not\r\nadvocate an end to the use of informal consultations by the\r\nCouncil, or that all Council meetings should take place in\r\npublic. We recognize that informal consultations are an\r\nindispensable tool for consensus-building and for effective\r\ndecision-making in the Council, as they are in any\r\nmultilateral process. But we believe that the Council has\r\ndeveloped an unhealthy reliance on them, to the detriment\r\nof transparency and, in many cases, effectiveness.\r\nMany routine briefings and reports by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral could and should take place in sessions open to\r\nMember States. Where particularly sensitive issues are\r\ninvolved, these could be dealt with in camera; but the\r\nmajority of reports would not fall into this category.\r\nAustralia also believes that there are circumstances\r\nwhere the Council can contribute to the resolution of\r\ndisputes or to the easing of tensions between Member\r\nStates by giving itself the option of direct access to the\r\ndisputing parties. We see no arguments for not allowing\r\na disputing party to appear before the Council to present\r\nits case, to respond to questions, or to be presented with\r\nthe Council\u0027s views, away from the public and the media\r\nspotlight. It is a mechanism that could help inform\r\nCouncil decisions, and it could also be a useful form of\r\nearly warning to disputing parties.\r\nAustralia\u0027s recent experience as leader of the\r\nmultinational force in East Timor has reinforced our\r\nconcerns about rigidities in Council procedures. Under\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1264 (1999), the leadership of\r\nthe multinational force is required to provide periodic\r\nreports to the Council. This we are doing, with two\r\nfortnightly reports submitted so far covering the first\r\nmonth of the operations of the International Force in East\r\nTimor (INTERFET). But, whereas in the case of a full\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation the Council can\r\nask questions and can engage in discussion with a senior\r\nrepresentative of that operation, there is no provision for\r\nthe multinational force leadership to brief the Council\r\ndirectly. Despite our responsibility for leadership of a\r\nmultinational force authorized by the Security Council,\r\nAustralia\u0027s status as a non-member of the Council\r\nprecludes such direct briefings, even on an occasional, as\r\nneeded, basis.\r\nThe recent Security Council mission to East Timor\r\nis, by contrast, an example of where quick and creative\r\naction by the Council has had a positive effect on the\r\nresolution of a complex issue. That mission enabled\r\nmembers of the Council to see firsthand the nature and\r\nextent of the problem, talk directly to the main players,\r\nand come to a more informed view about what to do\r\nnext. We again take the opportunity to commend the\r\nmembers of the mission — particularly the presidency of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nthe Netherlands and the leader of the mission, Ambassador\r\nAndjaba of Namibia — for taking this important initiative.\r\nIt is a good example of the authority of the Council\u0027s being\r\nused in a constructive, creative and timely way in support\r\nof the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe are very aware that many of these ideas have been\r\nthe subject of discussion not only in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform, but also in the\r\nCouncil\u0027s own informal working group. We wish to applaud\r\nand convey our support to those delegations in that informal\r\nworking group that have been working hard advocating\r\ngreater transparency and flexibility in the Council\u0027s working\r\nmethods.\r\nThere is no question but that the Security Council\r\nshould remain mistress of its own procedures. But\r\nincreasingly it is being hamstrung by the rigidities of those\r\nprocedures. Meeting the need for greater flexibility and\r\nopenness is overdue.\r\nAustralia welcomes the steps that have been taken so\r\nfar towards greater openness, including — as a good\r\nnumber of my colleagues have mentioned in this\r\ndiscussion — the organization of open debates, but I stress\r\nthat we welcome those when they genuinely contribute to\r\nCouncil deliberations. We also welcome the incorporation\r\nof transparency reforms that were introduced last year into\r\nthe report of the Security Council. We would like to see,\r\nhowever, the report acquire more analytical depth. We\r\nthink, like the representative of Ireland, that the monthly\r\nassessments by successive Presidents have taken us a step\r\nin that direction, but we consider that there is further to go.\r\nMore could and should be done, and in that regard we\r\nwould like the report in the future to include a forward-\r\nlooking assessment of the emerging challenges facing the\r\nCouncil.\r\nFinally, Australia would like to take this opportunity\r\nto place on record its appreciation to members of the\r\nCouncil for the individual contributions that they have made\r\nto the complex and difficult work of the Security Council\r\nover the last year. We would also like to congratulate very\r\nwarmly the newly elected non-permanent members on their\r\nelection and to pledge them our full support and\r\ncooperation as they face the challenging task ahead of them\r\nwhen they assume their seats next year.\r\nMr. Bouah-Kamon (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French):\r\nI would like to take this opportunity, as we discuss the\r\nreport of the Security Council, to make a few comments\r\nand suggestions concerning the matters examined by the\r\nCouncil as the body responsible for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as matters\r\nrelating to methods of work and procedural aspects.\r\nBy Article 24 of the Charter the members of the\r\nOrganization confer upon the Security Council the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. As we understand this provision, the\r\nSecurity Council is the body that must intervene wherever\r\ninternational peace and security are threatened or\r\ndisrupted. However, Chapter VIII provides that the\r\nCouncil may encourage regional organizations to instigate\r\nagreements for the peaceful settlement of disputes. We\r\nnote that today regional organizations are increasingly\r\ninvolved in peace initiatives, in ceasefire negotiations and\r\nin deploying troops to ensure security prior to United\r\nNations intervention.\r\nThe situation in Kosovo illustrated the paralysis of\r\nthe Security Council, bringing to mind the sad period of\r\nthe cold war. The secondary role played by the United\r\nNations after the robust intervention of the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) leads us to question the role\r\nof the Security Council in the resolution of regional\r\nconflicts. Will it be limited to humanitarian assistance and\r\npost-conflict activities, leaving mediation and peace-\r\nbuilding to regional organizations?\r\nShould the success of regional organizations in\r\nAfrica and elsewhere bring about the withdrawal of the\r\nSecurity Council from those regions? My delegation notes\r\nwith regret that after the setback in Somalia the United\r\nNations has stopped sending intervention troops to Africa\r\nand since then has involved itself cautiously and in a\r\nlimited way in the serious crises on our continent.\r\nDespite their economic and social difficulties,\r\nAfrican countries find themselves obliged to create the\r\nnecessary security conditions for the intervention of the\r\ninternational community when there is a breach of the\r\npeace. As peace is a prerequisite for social and economic\r\ndevelopment, our regional organizations — such as the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) and the Inter-Governmental\r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) — have had to\r\nbecome mediators for peace, to the detriment of their\r\nprimary purpose of regional economic integration. These\r\nregional and subregional bodies require financial and\r\nlogistical support from the international community, for\r\nwithout it they will not be able to discharge their original\r\nmandates.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nWe now note with concern another aspect of the\r\ndisengagement of the international community: the crisis in\r\nfunding peacekeeping operations. In referring to the United\r\nNations Mission in the Central African Republic\r\n(MINURCA) in his report on the work of the Organization,\r\nthe Secretary-General appropriately pointed out:\r\n“Unfortunately, funding for MINURCA is suffering\r\nfrom a worrying lack of enthusiasm among donors,\r\nand lack of funding will undoubtedly hamper the\r\nefforts of MINURCA to support and observe the\r\nelections.” (A/54/1, para. 97)\r\nIn the same context, recalling that initially there was\r\na very low donor response with regard to Tajikistan, he\r\nnoted:\r\n“The resulting delays again point to the drawbacks of\r\nfunding essential elements of a mandate through\r\nvoluntary contributions, rather than through assessed\r\ncontributions as is normally the case in peacekeeping\r\noperations.” (ibid, para. 98)\r\nMy delegation is concerned that some delegations\r\ncherish the hope that in each region of the world\r\n“policemen” charged with keeping the peace will\r\nmaterialize to lead peacekeeping operations and bear the\r\nburden. In Africa, where there are only developing\r\ncountries with limited resources faced with many conflicts,\r\nit would be difficult to find a substitute for the\r\ncontributions of the international community to\r\npeacekeeping. If this idea took root, it would acknowledge\r\nthe Security Council’s abdication of its responsibility and\r\ncall into question its very existence.\r\nThe situation in Kosovo leads us to reflect on the\r\ngrowing danger of seeing regional organizations go beyond\r\nthe limits of regional action imposed by Article 53 of the\r\nCharter. The use of force without Security Council\r\nauthorization is a serious threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nLikewise, the right to interfere without the Charter\r\nsafeguards is a real threat to respect for the sovereignty of\r\nMember States. While it is possible to some extent to\r\ntolerate humanitarian intervention, it must be decided by the\r\nSecurity Council in the name of the principle of universal\r\nhuman rights and to counter the threat of genocide.\r\nMy delegation would once again like to reiterate the\r\nconcern expressed by African States at the meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council held on 29 and 30 September to discuss\r\nthe situation in Africa. The Security Council should make\r\nan effort to restore its credibility by ending to its attitude\r\nof double standards with regard to Africa. Its mandate is\r\nto preserve peace throughout the world, and not only in\r\ncertain regions.\r\nEfforts are being made by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and some subregional groups to\r\nstrengthen Africa’s peacekeeping capability. Those efforts\r\nare praiseworthy, but they do not release the international\r\ncommunity and the Security Council from their\r\nparamount obligations with regard to peace and security\r\nin Africa. African Governments are shouldering their\r\nshare of the responsibility for finding solutions to the\r\nproblems that affect the continent. It is up to the Security\r\nCouncil to shoulder its share.\r\nWe are entitled to wonder whether a renewed and\r\nenlarged Council, with equitable geographical distribution\r\nand permanent members representing every region of the\r\nworld, including Africa, might not be better able to\r\nshoulder its responsibilities. Everyone agrees that the\r\nCouncil’s composition, structure and working methods\r\nhave become obsolete and do not reflect the political and\r\neconomic realities of today’s world. Security Council\r\nreform must necessarily take into consideration the new\r\ninternational realities. We believe that the right of veto\r\nmust be limited to measures under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter and that transparency in the functioning of the\r\nCouncil must be ensured. The Working Group should\r\nseek a consensus that reflects the interests of the majority\r\nof Member States. An enlarged, transparent and\r\ndemocratic Security Council will be in a good position to\r\nface the challenges of the coming millennium in the area\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nMy delegation considers that our Organization\r\nshould make greater efforts to prevent conflicts and also\r\nto strengthen regional and subregional machinery in order\r\nto minimize the causes of conflict. Early warning,\r\npreventive deployment, disarmament — particularly as\r\nregards small arms and light weapons — respect for\r\nhuman rights, and the struggle against poverty and\r\nmarginalization are some aspects of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations aimed at\r\npromoting a culture of peace.\r\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, we must\r\nreflect on ways and means of creating a world of peace\r\nby eliminating the causes of social and political instability\r\nand by creating a partnership among all forces of\r\ngoodwill. This would enable us to eradicate the causes of\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nconflict and help us to give all the world\u0027s peoples the\r\nopportunity to live at peace with each other.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nsubmission by the Security Council of its annual report to\r\nthe General Assembly is a constitutional requirement under\r\nthe provisions of Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. It is an affirmation of the concept of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s accountability to the General Assembly in its\r\ncapacity as the organ representing the membership of the\r\nOrganization, on whose behalf the Council acts.\r\nThe report represents a key aspect of this close\r\nrelationship between the two organs, as defined by the\r\nCharter, especially as regards the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The debate on the report\r\nof the Council is considered one of the General Assembly\u0027s\r\nmost important tools in exercising its mandate of following\r\nthe work of the Council, discussing the measures that the\r\nCouncil takes and issuing recommendations thereon. It is\r\nworth noting here that in addition to the provisions of the\r\nCharter governing the relationship between the Assembly\r\nand the Council, the 1962 Advisory Opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on certain expenses of the\r\nUnited Nations made a significant contribution to clarifying\r\nthis relationship in an official and legal manner.\r\nMoreover, the primary objective of General Assembly\r\nresolution 51/193 of 1996 emphasized the need to regulate\r\nthe relationship between the Assembly and the Council and\r\nto provide a greater measure of democracy and\r\ntransparency in international relations. Hence, we call on\r\nthe Council to submit, in addition to its annual reports to\r\nthe General Assembly, special reports on specific issues of\r\ninterest to it under Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nI would like to recall here the common paper\r\nsubmitted to the Council by Egypt and Indonesia in 1996,\r\nwhich included examples of cases where the Council should\r\nhave submitted special reports to the Assembly. The\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the Council\r\nshould not be confined solely to a debate in the Assembly\r\non its report but should include enhanced interaction\r\nbetween the two organs, as provided for in Articles 11 and\r\n12 of the Charter, so that the Security Council can exercise\r\nits right to call on the General Assembly to submit\r\nrecommendations regarding situations threatening\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations never intended to\r\nconfine this domain to the Council. The Security Council\r\nworks in the interests of Member States and on behalf of\r\nthe entire membership, hence it must act in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of the Charter and yield to the will of\r\nthe majority of the membership of this international\r\nOrganization. Thus the legitimate framework within which\r\nthe Council must meet its responsibilities is one of\r\ncommitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter,\r\nespecially non-resort to the use of force except in the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions adopted under Chapter\r\nVII. This necessarily requires the existence of a conflict\r\nor situations leading to a conflict, and that the dispute or\r\nsituation is tantamount to a threat to international peace\r\nand security or a breach thereof, or that an act of\r\naggression has actually been committed. It should not\r\nintervene in matters that are within the domestic\r\njurisdiction of States, as set out in Article 2, paragraph 7,\r\nof the Charter, which clarifies the relationship between\r\nthe internal jurisdiction of States and the measures that\r\ncan be taken by the Council when international peace and\r\nsecurity are in jeopardy.\r\nThe importance of the Council\u0027s responsibility is\r\nevident in the light of the changes that have occurred in\r\nthe international arena in the wake of the cold war.\r\nNumerous current armed conflicts are intra-State rather\r\nthan inter-State ones. This in turn raises the question of\r\nthe ability of the United Nations to intervene to settle\r\nthose conflicts. The international community must\r\ntherefore safeguard the sovereignty of States, since it is\r\nan essential characteristic of the contemporary\r\ninternational order and the linchpin of the Charter.\r\nThe international community must also see to it that\r\nthe Council abides by the main criterion defined by the\r\nCharter for its intervention by force under Chapter VII.\r\nArticle 39 gives the Council the power to determine the\r\nexistence of any threat to the peace or breach thereof, so\r\na given conflict, especially if it is internal, must be\r\ntantamount to a threat to international peace or a breach\r\nthereof.\r\nIn this regard, we would like to affirm the\r\nimportance of the Council\u0027s consideration of humanitarian\r\ncrises or human rights violations despite the fact that they\r\nmay not be tantamount to a threat to international peace\r\nand security. We should agree on an updated definition.\r\nHere I reiterate the need to discuss this objectively and\r\ndemocratically through an open and democratic\r\ninternational dialogue characterized by the greatest\r\nmeasure of candour and transparency and in a sound\r\nconstitutional framework. I would like to recall Egypt\u0027s\r\nproposal that this question be discussed in the context of\r\nthe Working Group on the Agenda for Peace, which, in\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nour view, is an appropriate forum for this purpose. Hence\r\nwe emphasize the need for the Council to consider those\r\nquestions that fall within its purview while refraining from\r\nencroaching on the competence of the Assembly.\r\nThe Council\u0027s discussion of the question of terrorism\r\nin a theoretical and abstract context and its adoption of a\r\nnormative resolution give rise to a number of misgivings on\r\nour part — not as far as the importance of resisting\r\nterrorism is concerned, which my country strongly\r\ncondemns in all its forms, but because of our conviction\r\nthat this issue falls within the purview of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt is possible to say that the report still seems to a\r\nlarge extent to be a mere compilation of documents that\r\ndelegations have already seen, which suggests that it has no\r\nreal function, is a waste of effort and resources and does\r\nnot therefore conform with the austerity measures taken by\r\nthe Organization.\r\nIt is not enough for anyone interested in the questions\r\ndiscussed by the Council simply to review an endless list of\r\ncommunications received by the Council or a list of its\r\nresolutions. The documents listed should be limited to those\r\nthat are not included in the published compilation of\r\nCouncil resolutions and decisions. On the other hand, we\r\nnote gratefully that this year the report includes a new\r\nsection providing information about the annual reports of\r\nthe sanctions committees, which we have often called for\r\nin the past.\r\nI should like to make several comments on that new\r\nsection. The report does not analyse the situations that have\r\nled to the imposition of sanctions, explain the purpose of\r\nimposing sanctions in each case or provide information\r\nabout the results of their imposition. In our view, the report\r\nshould include an evaluation of the results of the imposition\r\nof sanctions with a view to measuring their efficiency and\r\nthe extent to which they enhance the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and the extent of their\r\nimpact on the targeted States and on the region. For that\r\nreason, we call for the sanctions committees to hold open,\r\nformal meetings and to provide a record of the proceedings\r\nof their closed meetings, and for information about both to\r\nbe included in the report.\r\nThat brings me to my next comment, which relates to\r\nthe nature of sanctions imposed by the Council. We have\r\noften emphasized our belief that sanctions are an\r\nexceptional measure that should not be resorted to except\r\nin extreme situations, as provided for under Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, and after peaceful means for settling disputes,\r\nprovided for under Chapter VI, have been exhausted.\r\nFurthermore, individual political considerations of\r\nmembers should not take precedence over the collective\r\nconsiderations of the members of the Council or the\r\nMember States. We have also emphasized our belief that\r\nsuch sanctions should be imposed in accordance with\r\ndeclared objectives and established criteria, and within a\r\nlimited time-frame, so that they do not become a political\r\ntool for the Council.\r\nIt has become easy to impose sanctions, but difficult\r\nto lift them. We have drawn attention to the collateral\r\ndamage caused by the sanctions imposed under Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter, whether with regard to the populations\r\nof targeted States, as can be seen in the deteriorating\r\nhumanitarian situation in Iraq and the hardships that the\r\nLibyan people have suffered and are still suffering, or\r\nwith regard to third States whose interests are linked to\r\nthe States on which sanctions are imposed.\r\nRegrettably, sanctions imposed against certain States\r\nunder Chapter VII have caused serious damage to third\r\nStates and their peoples. Egypt is one of the States most\r\naffected, for reasons that are outside the purview of our\r\ncurrent debate. If the Council is considering imposing or\r\nrenewing sanctions on a particular State, it must give that\r\nState an opportunity to make its views known to the\r\nCouncil before those sanctions are imposed or renewed.\r\nWe also call upon the Council to allow States that are not\r\nmembers of the Council, but that believe that the\r\nimposition of such sanctions may prejudice their interests,\r\nto participate in the debate if the Council feels that their\r\ninterests will be particularly affected by the imposition of\r\nsuch sanctions.\r\nAs regards the stage following the imposition of\r\nsanctions, I need not remind the Assembly that the\r\nCharter has never sought to inflict damage on the interests\r\nof third States. Rather, it has established a mechanism to\r\nwhich the Council has not resorted so far, whereby the\r\nCouncil can consult with the State concerned and acquaint\r\nitself with its point of view before imposing sanctions,\r\nthereby enabling the Council to form a complete picture\r\nencompassing humanitarian, economic and political\r\naspects.\r\nIn this regard, we call upon the Security Council\r\nonce again to consider establishing further permanent\r\nmeasures and mechanisms to hold consultations, as\r\nprovided in the Charter, with third States that face, or\r\nmay face, particular economic problems resulting from\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nthe implementation of preventive or coercive measures\r\ntaken by the Council. The aim of this would be to find\r\nsolutions to such problems, including ways and means to\r\nincrease the effectiveness of its working methods and\r\npractices when reviewing requests for assistance submitted\r\nby affected States.\r\nIn this regard, we note with interest the comments in\r\nthis year’s report of the Secretary-General on the work of\r\nthe Organization with regard to the importance of\r\nconsidering the concept of targeted sanctions. Egypt has\r\nalways stressed the need for a clear legal framework and\r\nestablished rules to govern the work of the Council.\r\nWithout such a framework, the door will be open to double\r\nstandards, which will undermine the credibility of the\r\nCouncil and the legitimacy of its resolutions. That is why\r\nEgypt and the other non-aligned countries called for all of\r\nthe reform measures agreed upon in the Working Group on\r\nCouncil reform to be institutionalized. In December 1997,\r\ntowards the end of its term as a non-permanent member of\r\nthe Council, Egypt, together with the other non-permanent\r\nmembers at the time, submitted a paper calling for\r\nrecording the proceedings of the informal consultations of\r\nthe Council so as to make it easier for the new members of\r\nthe Council to undertake the mandate for which they were\r\nelected. We hope that the next report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly will include a record of\r\nsuch practices.\r\nFinally, it is clear that discussing improvements in the\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly is\r\njust one component of the comprehensive endeavour to\r\nreform the work of the Council and to enhance the\r\ntransparency of its work. This will necessitate a\r\ncomprehensive approach to the issues, foremost among\r\nwhich must be consideration of the veto, which calls at this\r\nstage for serious consideration by all Member States.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): The authors of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations envisaged the annual reports of the\r\nSecurity Council, the organ with primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security, as a centrepiece of\r\nthe Council\u0027s communication with the General Assembly,\r\nthe United Nations organ with the general responsibility for\r\nthe realization of Charter principles. The General Assembly\r\nis entitled to analyze the work of the Security Council, to\r\nencourage improvements in its work and, naturally, to\r\ncriticize its shortcomings. The current report of the Security\r\nCouncil reveals both improvements and shortcomings. As\r\nan elected member of the Security Council, Slovenia feels\r\nresponsible to share its experience with other States\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nThe period covered in the report has been a dynamic\r\none, and important new experience was gained during this\r\ntime. The work of the Security Council was characterized\r\nby both activism and hesitation, by the will to act as well\r\nas an awareness of shortages with respect to the resources\r\nthat are vital for action. Those shortages of available\r\nresources have time and again cast doubt on the political\r\nwill of Member States to make the Council an effective\r\norgan truly capable of carrying out its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn the area of the Security Council\u0027s methods of\r\nwork, there were some important improvements. The\r\nCouncil has expanded the amount of its public work,\r\nincluding public meetings and public briefings. The\r\nassessments of the Presidents of the Security Council are\r\nbecoming more substantive, and statements to the press\r\nare available in written form. Some of the elected\r\nmembers, including ourselves, have also started using the\r\nnew opportunities provided by the information\r\nsuperhighway to make assessments and statements to the\r\npress available to the wider public.\r\nThe sanctions committees are making their work\r\nmore accessible. The Chairpersons of the sanctions\r\ncommittees launched an initiative in September last year\r\nwhich produced a coherent set of guidelines and proposals\r\nfor future policy-making and practical methods of work\r\nrelating to sanctions. Specific proposals for improved\r\nworking methods in this area, as advanced by the\r\nChairpersons of the sanctions committees, were adopted\r\non 29 January this year in the form of a note by the\r\nPresident of the Security Council (S/1999/92).\r\nMoreover, in the case of the sanctions against Libya,\r\nthe Security Council has demonstrated its ability to\r\nsuspend sanctions and, before that, to help in the process\r\nof creating conditions for suspension. At present,\r\nconsultations are under way to develop a new system for\r\nIraq which should include a realistic possibility of\r\nsuspension of sanctions, in parallel with substantive\r\nprogress in the implementation of Iraqi obligations\r\nrelating to weapons of mass destruction. I am pleased to\r\nnote that the idea of suspension, first suggested by\r\nSlovenia on 25 January this year, has gained very wide\r\nacceptance. Now, new dynamism is necessary to\r\novercome the stalemate which has characterized relations\r\nwith Iraq for too long.\r\nOne among the recent developments deserves special\r\nattention: the successful mission of the Security Council\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nto Jakarta and Dili in September this year. Although\r\ntechnically outside the scope of the present report, it must\r\nbe mentioned for two reasons. First, the mission is an\r\nimportant part of the Council\u0027s responsibility initiated by the\r\ntripartite Agreement on East Timor concluded on 5 May\r\nthis year; and secondly, it provides an example of the need\r\nfor quick Council action when circumstances so require.\r\nSuccess of the mission suggests that the Council should use\r\nthis method in the future, and that it should ensure that the\r\nauthoritative character of missions dispatched by the\r\nCouncil is preserved. In other words, such missions should\r\nbe sent to provide practical assistance or to enable\r\nsolutions, not only to study situations.\r\nFinally, and perhaps most important, on the positive\r\nside, the period covered in the present report encompasses\r\ndevelopments which have started to give renewed\r\nimportance to peacekeeping and other military operations\r\nlaunched or authorized by the Security Council. The report\r\nalso relates to developments that have started to give a new\r\nrole to the United Nations in post-conflict peace-building by\r\nestablishing civilian administrations in crisis regions. That\r\nevolution, which started in 1998 with the peacekeeping\r\noperation in the Central African Republic, has brought the\r\nSecurity Council to the threshold of a new era characterized\r\nby new operations in Kosovo and East Timor, as well as in\r\nSierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa. Today, at the\r\nbeginning of this new phase, the international community\r\nmust mobilize all its will and all the necessary resources to\r\nsucceed in this new and difficult set of missions.\r\nThe success of the new peacekeeping missions, and\r\nindeed of the entire work of the Security Council, is by no\r\nmeans assured. In all the areas where progress can be\r\nnoted, one must also recognize great difficulties, some of\r\nwhich vastly overshadow the degree of success achieved so\r\nfar. In the domain of the Council\u0027s methods of work, we\r\nmust ask ourselves whether the practice of holding frequent\r\nthematic debates serves the effectiveness of the Security\r\nCouncil. It is probably too early for an assessment of the\r\neffect of thematic debates undertaken in the period covered\r\nby the present report. However, it is not premature to\r\ncaution against repetition and against the possibility of\r\nchoosing subjects which properly belong to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nEfforts to improve the Security Council\u0027s policies\r\nrelating to sanctions leave much to be desired. While the\r\nCouncil has been able to suspend sanctions when conditions\r\nwere met, it has been less capable of modifying the\r\noperation of sanctions regimes so as to improve their\r\ntargeting, enhance the efficiency of their implementation\r\nand ensure that adverse humanitarian effects are\r\nminimized. In addition to improved decisions on specific\r\nsanctions regimes, the Council needs an improved overall\r\npolicy framework that would provide more sophisticated\r\ncriteria for the introduction and targeting of sanctions as\r\nwell as for humanitarian exemptions, for modification and\r\nfor the termination of sanctions. The note by the President\r\nof the Security Council of 29 January this year is a\r\nmodest beginning which should lead to the elaboration of\r\na more complete policy framework.\r\nThe present report refers to a wide variety of\r\nsituations, some of which reveal fundamental questions\r\nabout the functioning of the Security Council. In our\r\nopinion, three among them call for special attention.\r\nFirst, while we welcome contributions by members\r\nof groups of States which have a special interest and seek\r\na special role in dealing with particular crisis situations,\r\nsome of the practices of such groups deserve critical\r\nconsideration. Thus, for example, the group of six plus\r\ntwo States on Afghanistan continues to plead against\r\nmilitary assistance to parties in Afghanistan, while at the\r\nsame time little is being done to give practical effect to\r\nthose pleas. In the period covered by the report, the\r\nContact Group on the former Yugoslavia was unable to\r\nprovide a meaningful contribution to addressing the issues\r\nof Kosovo and of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Such\r\nexamples clearly give rise to concern. Groups which were\r\nestablished as diplomatic instruments to assist the Security\r\nCouncil could turn into unhelpful devices only creating\r\nthe illusion of assistance to the Council\u0027s efforts.\r\nSecondly, further thought needs to be given to the\r\nevolution of a variety of relationships between the United\r\nNations and various regional organizations. It is accurate\r\nto say that regional organizations generally provide\r\nvaluable assistance to the United Nations in addressing\r\nmany crisis situations. Sometimes United Nations action\r\nwithout assistance of a regional organization becomes\r\ninconceivable, as shown in the cases of Sierra Leone and\r\nKosovo. However, the political management of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations needs to be improved further. Additional\r\nefforts need to be made to ensure that cooperation by\r\nregional organizations is in strict accordance with the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, and that the primacy of the\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security is not impaired.\r\nThirdly, the veto continues to give rise to serious\r\nquestions. In the period covered by the present report,\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nSecurity Council action has been impaired by the veto of a\r\npermanent member, which prevented extension of a\r\npeacekeeping operation in a particularly volatile region. A\r\nfew months earlier, Council action had been impaired by a\r\nthreat to use the veto by another permanent member. That\r\nthreat resulted in the adoption of an incomplete resolution\r\nwhich did not properly address all aspects of a threat to the\r\npeace. Subsequent experience showed once again that an\r\nincomplete response by the Security Council, sometimes\r\nresulting from a threat to use the veto, can lead to wrong\r\ndecisions by the parties on the ground and to further\r\naggravation of the threat to the peace.\r\nThere is nothing new in the thought that the veto\r\nshould be used in the interest of international peace and\r\nsecurity and that the element of national interest should be\r\nmeasured very carefully. Therefore, proposals to curtail the\r\nveto deserve careful consideration.\r\nThis brings me to my final point. The experience of\r\nthe past year has once again proved the need for Security\r\nCouncil reform. That reform will be complete only if the\r\nissue of the veto is addressed adequately. We believe that\r\nthe efforts of the Open-ended Working Group of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on Security Council reform should be\r\nstrengthened and that all United Nations Members should\r\nthink hard and define the immediate objectives of that\r\nreform. It seems that without an agreement on the\r\ncurtailment of the veto, it is not realistic to expect any\r\nagreement on new permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe realities of life do not allow the Security Council\r\nto stand still. Action is needed almost daily. The General\r\nAssembly can help in a variety of ways — by giving\r\ngeneral guidance, by performing its own tasks in the field\r\nof maintenance of peace and security and, above all, by\r\npursuing adequate reforms — at times when reforms are\r\ndue. This is such a time.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAlthough for many of our delegations it is absolutely\r\ninsufficient, at least this Assembly has a chance once a year\r\nto discuss extensively the work of the Security Council on\r\nthe basis of its yearly report. We are grateful to the\r\nmembers of the Council and to the Secretariat for the effort\r\nthat was surely involved in the preparation of such a large\r\namount of material, which this year runs to almost 500\r\npages.\r\nDespite the many criticisms that it draws year after\r\nyear, the report that we see before us today is basically like\r\nthe ones we have seen in years past. We have pages and\r\npages of resolutions, presidential statements, documents\r\nsent and received, all previously known to the delegations\r\nor easy to locate. Without disregarding its value as part of\r\nthe institutional memory of the Council, we reiterate that\r\nthis type of report is far from what we hope for or need.\r\nRather than a compilation of documents and an\r\ninsubstantial narrative of the evolution of issues on the\r\nagenda, we would like to have an analytical report that\r\nsets out the political and legal basis for at least the most\r\nimportant decisions adopted by the Council.\r\nThe presentation of the yearly report of the Security\r\nCouncil is not a privilege granted to the Members of the\r\nAssembly; quite the contrary, it is an obligation clearly\r\nestablished in Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter. The\r\nMember States represented in the Assembly have a\r\nlegitimate right to expect a proper account from the organ\r\nto which we have entrusted the primary responsibility for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security and which, in\r\naccordance with the Charter, acts on behalf of all Member\r\nStates.\r\nIt was precisely in order to guarantee a proper\r\naccount that, on the initiative of the countries of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, in 1996 the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 51/193, which encouraged the Council,\r\nin the submission of its reports to the Assembly, to\r\nprovide a timely, substantive and analytical account of its\r\nwork. Sadly, three years after the adoption of that\r\nresolution, the report of the Council still fails to take it\r\nduly into consideration, and the Assembly has not even\r\nbeen told why.\r\nThe General Assembly has still not received the\r\nspecial reports that, in accordance with article 24,\r\nparagraph 3, of the Charter, the Council must provide\r\nwhen necessary. Presenting such reports on specific\r\nquestions would contribute to promoting the active\r\nrelationship between the two organs, which we all desire,\r\nand the Assembly could then prepare useful\r\nrecommendations for the Council\u0027s work on this basis. We\r\nwould like to know the opinion of the Council on what\r\nkind of situations warrant the presentation of special\r\nreports, because at present there seem not to be any. Does\r\nthe crisis in Kosovo not deserve a special report, that\r\nbeing a case in which the Security Council was entirely\r\nignored as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) decided to carry out military action in flagrant\r\nviolation of the most elementary principles of the Charter\r\nand international law?\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nDuring the year under consideration, the credibility of\r\nthe Council, already impaired, suffered grave harm, and not\r\na word about this appears in the yearly report or in any\r\nspecial report on this serious situation. This constitutes yet\r\nanother clear proof that a profound reform of the Council\r\nis needed, undoubtedly the most sensitive task in the reform\r\nof the United Nations as a whole.\r\nThe Council should also prepare special reports on the\r\nreasons behind its increasingly clear incursion, without\r\nprevious governmental agreement, into areas of the\r\neconomic, social and humanitarian spheres, far beyond its\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter.\r\nWith the excuse of seeking efficiency, the Security\r\nCouncil continues to do most of its work in closed\r\nmeetings, even though this method has been emphatically\r\nand repeatedly called unacceptable by the immense majority\r\nof the Member States. The figures provided in the report\r\nitself illustrate clearly that the practice of former years\r\nremains unchanged. This year, while 121 formal meetings\r\nwere held, 239 closed consultations of the whole were held,\r\nwhich amounts to two thirds of all the meetings of the\r\nCouncil. It would have been interesting if, along with\r\nnoting that 511 hours were spent in private consultations,\r\nthe report told us how many hours the Council spent in\r\nformal meetings. We are certain that this would further\r\nshow the imbalance between private and formal meetings\r\nof the Council.\r\nSo entrenched is the secrecy syndrome in the Council\u0027s\r\nwork that even most briefings on agenda items by the\r\nSecretary-General or his representatives are given in private\r\nmeetings. In contrast, the open briefings held in the past\r\nyear have been a very positive experience and show how\r\neffective transparency can be in the work of the Council.\r\nAs a part of the reform of the Security Council, which we\r\nwill discuss in more detail under agenda item 38, we feel\r\nthat formal meetings must be the rule in the Council\u0027s work.\r\nUntil that goal is reached, the yearly report should also\r\ninclude records of the debates held in closed consultations,\r\nand dissenting opinions of Council members on certain\r\nagenda items should be reflected. In view of the limitations\r\nof the yearly report, the assessments by former Presidents\r\nand the daily informal briefing of the sitting President\r\nremain the only mechanisms that allow us a peek at what\r\noccurs in the private consultations.\r\nIn order to exercise our right to the information\r\nneeded by our Governments to take timely political\r\ndecisions, most of our delegations have to waste hours\r\nwaiting in the South Lounge until some friendly\r\nrepresentative of a Security Council member is ready to\r\nshare information.\r\nThis year\u0027s incorporation of the annual reports of the\r\nsanctions Committees into the report is a step forward and\r\nshould be maintained, but we underline the need for the\r\nmeetings of these Committees to be open and for the\r\nrecords of their discussions to be included in the yearly\r\nreport of the Council. This will provide the necessary\r\ntransparency and will help discourage the manipulation of\r\nsanctions by some powerful members of the Council as\r\na mechanism for punishing certain countries in order to\r\nserve their national interests.\r\nAlthough we do not intend to discuss specific\r\nsituations, we cannot fail to mention our concern about\r\nthe fact that while most items on the agenda of the\r\nCouncil have to do with Africa, most of the attention and\r\nresources allocated to respond to crises are still not\r\ndirected towards Africa. The Council cannot concentrate\r\nits attention on solving the problems of certain regions\r\nwhile remaining indifferent to others.\r\nTransparency in the methods of work and the\r\ncreation of authentic interaction with the General\r\nAssembly and the Member States will not weaken the\r\nCouncil; it will strengthen it. The first step would be for\r\nthe Council to duly examine the observations and\r\nsuggestions made during this debate on the annual report\r\nand to take them into account in the process of changing\r\nits methods of work.\r\nI would like to conclude by congratulating the newly\r\nelected members of the Security Council — Jamaica,\r\nBangladesh, Mali, Tunisia and Ukraine — to which we\r\nwish the greatest success in their work. We are sure that\r\nthey will spare no effort on the long road to be travelled\r\nbefore we have the Security Council we all hope for.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw the\r\nattention of the Assembly to document A/INF/54/3/Add.2,\r\nwhich has been distributed to delegations this morning.\r\nThe document contains the tentative programme of work\r\nand schedule of plenary meetings of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nThe lists of speakers for items mentioned in that\r\ndocument are now open.\r\nThe General Assembly, in due course, will be kept\r\ninformed of the dates for the consideration of other agenda\r\nitems, as well as of any additions or changes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
