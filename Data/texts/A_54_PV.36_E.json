(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Jayanama\r\n(Thailand), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/54/2)\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I wish to thank the President\r\nof the Security Council, Ambassador Sergey Lavrov of the\r\nRussian Federation, for his succinct and balanced\r\npresentation of this year’s report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly. My delegation believes that the\r\nconsideration of this report by the Assembly will provide an\r\nopportunity for the larger membership of the Organization\r\nto reflect upon and assess developments pertaining to\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as the work of the\r\nCouncil, during the period covered by the report.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the positive developments in\r\nthe work of the Council, which reflect its increased\r\ntransparency. These include the regular, sometimes daily\r\nbriefings by the presidency, which are attended by an\r\nincreasing number of non-members of the Council, and the\r\nincreased frequency of open debates and open briefings,\r\nwith the participation of non-members of the Council. At\r\nthe same time, there is greater willingness on the part of the\r\nCouncil to engage in broader thematic debates that expand\r\nthe Security Council’s capacity to deal with current\r\nchallenges to peace and security. These debates include\r\nitems on, among others, the protection of civilians in\r\narmed conflict and protection for humanitarian assistance\r\nto refugees and others in conflict situations. It goes\r\nwithout saying that improving transparency in the work of\r\nthe Council has enhanced the credibility of the Council\r\nvis-à-vis the general membership of the United Nations.\r\nThere have been serious discussions, both in the\r\nCouncil and in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nreform and restructuring of the Security Council, on the\r\nneed to improve further the effectiveness of the work of\r\nthe Council. At the core of these discussions is the\r\nimportance of enhancing the process of consultations\r\nbetween the Council and States that are directly involved\r\nin particular issues before the Council, as well as with\r\nother concerned parties. Clearly, enhanced consultations\r\nwould serve two important purposes: receiving vital\r\ninformation and inputs from the concerned parties, as well\r\nas putting across the views and positions of the Council\r\nto these parties. Such interactions and exchanges would\r\ncertainly contribute to improving the decision-making\r\nprocess of the Council.\r\nMy delegation and most, if not all elected members\r\nof the Council strongly believe in the need for the\r\nCouncil to obtain direct information from the parties\r\nconcerned, including through their direct involvement in\r\nthe discussions of the Council. My delegation supports the\r\nefforts to open up the informal consultations of the\r\nCouncil, in which much of the work of the Council takes\r\nplace, to representatives of concerned States not members\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nof the Council. The presence of ministers and other senior\r\nrepresentatives of concerned parties in the informal\r\nconsultations, as opposed to the more informal setting of\r\nthe “Arria formula”, would enrich the process of\r\nconsultations and decision-making of the Council. While\r\nthey should not replace the mechanism of bilateral\r\nconsultations between States and Council members, which\r\nhas its own purpose, such meetings between Council\r\nmembers and concerned non-members in informal\r\nconsultation would open up a direct channel of\r\ncommunication and dialogue on important issues being\r\nconsidered by the Council.\r\nInsofar as the “Arria formula” is concerned, my\r\ndelegation would like to see this mechanism, which is a\r\npragmatic and useful one, being used in accordance with its\r\noriginal concept, specifically to facilitate an informal\r\nexchange of views between Council members and\r\nindividuals, organizations or institutions on issues being\r\nconsidered by the Council. The permanent representative of\r\nVenezuela, in his letters to the Secretary-General and the\r\nPresident of the Security Council dated 15 March 1999,\r\nclearly stated the rationale and purpose of the “Arria\r\nformula”, named after one of his predecessors, which he\r\nsaid was intended for the purpose of obtaining\r\n“direct assessments from individuals, organizations or\r\ninstitutions that could ... contribute to a better\r\nunderstanding of the situation under consideration”.\r\n(A/53/865)\r\nThis clearly shows that the formula was not intended for\r\nthe purpose of receiving the representatives of sovereign\r\nStates that are full members of the Organization in a\r\nmeeting room away from the Council Chamber.\r\nIn addition to opening up the informal consultation\r\nprocess of the Council, my delegation would also support\r\nutilizing more frequently the mechanism of the so-called\r\n“private meetings” of the Council, in which the Council\r\nmeets in closed formal sessions in its Chamber for an\r\nexchange of views with representatives of concerned States.\r\nWe believe that all of these are constructive proposals\r\nthat would serve to open up the consultation process of the\r\nCouncil. Their adoption would go a long way towards not\r\nonly making the Council more transparent and accessible to\r\nthe larger membership of the United Nations, but also\r\nimproving the decision-making process of the Council as it\r\ngrapples with the complex and challenging issues of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMy delegation, like those of other Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, is concerned at the paralysis of the\r\nCouncil on some important issues. In such situations, the\r\nCouncil loses its credibility and effectiveness to act, with\r\nserious implications for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. This is also a matter of concern to the\r\nSecretary-General who, in his remarks at the opening of\r\nthe current session of the General Assembly, alluded to it\r\nin the context of the interesting but controversial concept\r\nof humanitarian intervention, which has prompted various\r\nreactions from Member States and will surely be the\r\nsubject of further debates in the coming weeks and\r\nmonths. We have made some preliminary remarks on this\r\nconcept and will deal with it in greater depth at the\r\nappropriate time.\r\nIt cannot be denied that much of the impasse in, and\r\nparalysis of, the Council has to do with one aspect of its\r\ndecision-making process: the use or threat of use of the\r\nveto, the all-powerful weapon of the permanent members.\r\nThat was at the core of the Council’s inaction in the face\r\nof the Rwanda genocide and the Kosovo tragedy, which\r\nprompted the use of force without the authorization of the\r\nCouncil. Clearly, the issue of the veto will have to be\r\nseriously addressed by the membership of the\r\nOrganization, including the permanent members\r\nthemselves, and ways found to circumscribe it, or at least\r\nmanage it better, if the Council is to function effectively\r\nso as to avoid future Rwandas and Kosovos.\r\nInvoking Charter rights alone in defence of the veto\r\nis not helpful, as the Charter provides not only rights, but\r\nalso obligations and responsibilities. It is to be hoped that\r\nsome creative way of managing the veto in the context of\r\nour times will be found and supported by the permanent\r\nmembers, in their enlightened self-interest and in the\r\ninterest of the international community as a whole. In the\r\nface of many complex challenges ahead, the issue of the\r\nCouncil’s efficiency will have to be addressed as a matter\r\nof urgency if we are to avoid a crisis of unmanageable\r\nproportions in the Council.\r\nAnother issue of concern to my delegation relates to\r\nthe use of sanctions. While it is a recognized instrument\r\nof coercion provided for in the Charter, as a measure of\r\nlast resort when all peaceful means have failed, sanctions\r\nshould be imposed only after a careful analysis of their\r\nlikely impact has been made. This is to ensure that the\r\nsanctions to be imposed would have the desired impact\r\nonly on the target or targets of the sanctions, and not on\r\nthe general population. My delegation is supportive of the\r\nongoing discussions in the Council to consider ways and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nmeans for the effective implementation and management of\r\ncurrent sanctions regimes, which will also serve as useful\r\nguidelines for future sanctions regimes that the Council\r\nmay decide to impose, when absolutely necessary.\r\nMy delegation is particularly concerned with the\r\ndebilitating effects of comprehensive sanctions, such as\r\nthose imposed on Iraq, which have very serious\r\nhumanitarian consequences for the ordinary people of Iraq.\r\nWe have stated on several occasions that the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil, bear a heavy responsibility to ameliorate the\r\nsufferings of the Iraqi people, even as they address the\r\nimportant issues of peace and security in the region and the\r\nother important outstanding issues from the Gulf War. We\r\nconsider it important and necessary that countries affected\r\nby sanctions be given a fair hearing by the Council. We\r\nwould encourage chairmen of the sanctions committees to\r\nvisit the targeted countries to evaluate the situation on the\r\nground, whenever appropriate. We would also urge the\r\nCouncil to formally lift sanctions as soon as they are no\r\nlonger necessary or legally required, as, for instance, in the\r\ncase of Libya. Like all powerful weapons, sanctions should\r\nbe utilized with extreme care so as to avoid inflicting\r\ndamage on unintended targets, which, regrettably, often\r\nhappens.\r\nOn the issue of peacekeeping, the Organization has\r\nclearly benefited tremendously from the experiences and\r\nlessons learned from past missions. As a troop-contributing\r\ncountry, Malaysia is pleased with the increased and regular\r\ninteraction with the Council on peacekeeping missions in\r\nwhich we are involved. This contributes to better\r\ncoordination and decision-making on the deployment of\r\npersonnel and related matters. A continuing matter of\r\nconcern for some years, of course, relates to the issue of\r\ndelayed reimbursements of peacekeeping costs. Unless the\r\nsituation is improved in the near future, it will certainly\r\naffect the capacity and willingness of developing countries\r\nto contribute troops to future United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions.\r\nIt is equally important for peacekeeping missions to be\r\nestablished expeditiously in response to crisis situations,\r\nfollowing the establishment of their appropriate mandates\r\nby the Council. In this regard, there is concern that\r\ndeliberations in the Council are sometimes stymied by\r\nnarrow and short-term budgetary approaches. This will\r\ninadvertently weaken the Council’s authority and often also\r\nthat of the Secretary-General in the planning and\r\nimplementation of such operations. It sends a wrong\r\nmessage of a lack of real concern on the part of the\r\nCouncil to the affected parties, and runs the risk of the\r\nCouncil being perceived as being selective in its\r\nresponses to various conflict situations. As the Council\r\nconsiders a number of peacekeeping operations in Africa,\r\nit is important to address this issue so as to dispel such\r\nperceptions.\r\nThe central and critical role of the Security Council\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security is\r\nwell spelled out in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nHowever, in carrying out its work, the consistent support\r\nof the international community is vital to ensure the\r\nlegitimacy of its decisions in the eyes of the larger\r\nmembership of the Organization that are not privy to the\r\ndeliberations of the Council. My delegation, therefore,\r\nwarmly commends this report, as it contributes to\r\nincreased understanding of, and support for, the work of\r\nthe Council. It also provides an opportunity for vital\r\nfeedback from Member States. As improving the\r\nCouncil’s working methods is an ongoing process, my\r\ndelegation looks forward to improved reporting of the\r\nwork of the Council to the General Assembly, including,\r\nwhenever possible, the submission of special reports, as\r\nprovided for in the Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to extend\r\nour warmest congratulations to the five newly elected\r\nnon-permanent members of the Council. We look forward\r\nto working closely with them in the Council when they\r\ntake their seats next year.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (spoke in French): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is again taking up a report of the\r\nSecurity Council, submitted in accordance with Article\r\n24, paragraph 3, and Article 15, paragraph 1, of the\r\nCharter. We would like to thank the Council and its\r\nPresident for this report.\r\nDuring our consideration of last year’s report of the\r\nSecurity Council, my delegation noted with interest the\r\nimprovements made to it, particularly the inclusion of\r\ninformation about the work of its subsidiary bodies,\r\nincluding the sanctions committees, and the introduction\r\nof information about documentation, the sanctions\r\ncommittee and the Council’s working methods. My\r\ndelegation also expressed its appreciation of the new\r\npractice adopted by the Council of publishing, as an\r\naddendum, brief summaries of the Council’s work,\r\nprovided by former Presidents of the Council. Even if\r\nthey do not reflect the Council’s views, at least they\r\nprovide supplementary information about the Council’s\r\nwork, in particular about the informal meetings and the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nstatements made to the press. Member States now have a\r\nsomewhat clearer idea of the work of this important body\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nDespite these improvements to the report, in our\r\nopinion it is still in general insufficiently analytical and\r\ninformative, particularly about the informal deliberations\r\nand consultations, which are not open to United Nations\r\nMembers that are not on the Council. My country believes\r\nthat for it to be a real tool for positive interaction between\r\nthe two principal organs of the United Nations — the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly — the report\r\nshould be more analytical about the Council’s work on all\r\nthe items of which it is seized, in order to reflect the\r\ntransparency that is sought.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the Security Council will\r\ncontinue to consider ways to improve its working methods\r\nand procedures, including by submitting the special reports\r\nreferred to in paragraph 3 of Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nMy delegation would like to see increased\r\ntransparency in the Council’s work, and it will work to that\r\nend in the Council when it takes a seat as a non-permanent\r\nmember in January 2000. My delegation also hopes that the\r\ndiscussions in the General Assembly Working Group on\r\nincreasing the Council’s membership and improving its\r\nworking methods will come to a successful conclusion as\r\nsoon as possible so as to enhance the Council’s\r\nrepresentativity.\r\nAn examination of the report shows the prominent\r\nplace occupied by African questions on the Council’s\r\nagenda — in particular, the discussions on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the causes of conflict in Africa, as well\r\nas the work of the Council relating to the situation in\r\ncertain African countries. We wish to stress the importance\r\nthat should be attached to improving Africa’s peacekeeping\r\ncapacity, in coordination between the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the United Nations.\r\nThe latest report of the Security Council also\r\nhighlights the ongoing importance of peacekeeping\r\noperations, which requires that the Organization’s\r\npeacekeeping capacities be constantly improved and refined.\r\nThis work includes complete implementation of the United\r\nNations standby forces arrangements, to which my country\r\nhas had the honour of adhering since June 1999, when it\r\nplaced some resources at the disposal of the Organization.\r\nWith regard to general questions not related to a\r\nspecific country or conflict — humanitarian matters, the\r\nprotection of civilians during conflicts, the protection of\r\nchildren, international terrorism and so forth — my\r\ndelegation wishes to stress the importance of maintaining\r\nan interactive dialogue between the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly and of respect for the mandates\r\nand prerogatives of each of the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish briefly to refer to the\r\nquestion of the imposition of sanctions by the Security\r\nCouncil as one of the instruments for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. In this connection, I wish\r\nto reiterate the importance we attach to a certain number\r\nof parameters which are generally recognized by the\r\ninternational community and which we think should be\r\nconstantly taken into account during the imposition of\r\nsanctions: that they should be used as a last resort; that\r\ntheir scope and duration should be limited; that their\r\nimpact on civilian populations should be eased; and,\r\nfinally, that they should take into account the interests of\r\nthird countries, in accordance with Article 50 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMr. Kastrup (Germany): The Security Council is\r\npresenting its annual report for the fifty-fourth time. This\r\ncomprehensive, long document bears witness to the\r\nmanifold activities of the Security Council during the\r\nperiod under review. The report reflects the enormous\r\nworkload, which has again increased compared with the\r\nprevious year. All members of the Security Council\r\ndeserve our respect and gratitude for shouldering this\r\nburden in exercising the duties conferred upon them by\r\nMember States, in accordance with the United Nations\r\nCharter. It is worthwhile to recall at this stage that the\r\nSecurity Council, in carrying out these duties, is indeed\r\nacting on behalf of all of us, the Member States.\r\nThe statistics indicate that the tendency to meet\r\nbehind closed doors is continuing. Informal consultations\r\nhave taken place nearly twice as often as open meetings.\r\nThis development, in our view, deserves close attention.\r\nThere are understandable reasons why the Security\r\nCouncil needs to come together from time to time in a\r\nconfidential format to allow substantial and in-depth\r\ndiscussions. I would also like to specifically recognize the\r\nwillingness to cooperate and to provide information on\r\nthe part of the Security Council members vis-à-vis the\r\nnon-members.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nHowever, there is a fundamental question of how to\r\ninclude involved parties prior to the actual consultations and\r\nhow to enable third parties with vital interests to participate\r\nin informal Security Council meetings. In this connection,\r\nI would like to point to the laudable work of the Council’s\r\ninformal working group on documentation and other\r\nprocedural questions. These efforts to improve the working\r\nmethods of the Council complement the ongoing Cluster-II\r\ndeliberations in the Open-ended Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil reform, and should be strongly encouraged to\r\ncontinue.\r\nThis raises some admittedly difficult questions. For\r\nexample: how can practical procedures be found which take\r\ninto account the need of involved parties to be informed,\r\nand, at the same time, the occasional need of the Security\r\nCouncil to proceed confidentially? Which types of\r\nprocedures would be flexible enough to be available in\r\nindividual cases and yet not appear arbitrary?\r\nHowever, the question of access should not be looked\r\nat from procedural or legal points of view only. The\r\nbroader the base of the Security Council deliberations —\r\nthat is, the more countries with a just cause or vital interest\r\nto be heard will participate in the discussions — the\r\nstronger could be the democratic legitimization of the\r\nCouncil’s decisions and resolutions in a world of increasing\r\nconflicts.\r\nRather, the Council should consider, in a pragmatic\r\nway, more transparent procedures, and decide whenever\r\npossible on a more open format. And — what is important\r\n— no article of the Charter needs to be changed or\r\namended. The Security Council is, as we all know, the\r\nmaster of its own procedure. That means that this boils\r\ndown to a matter of political will.\r\nIt may be worthwhile recalling that reform does not\r\nconsist of papers and statistics. A reference book including\r\nstatistics and documents may be quite useful for technical\r\nreasons. It is a kind of accounting on the part of the\r\nSecurity Council before the General Assembly. However,\r\nit is not enough to merely present an industrious,\r\nlabour-intensive report on the Council’s activities. There is,\r\nunfortunately, no mention of the challenges the Security\r\nCouncil is facing, let alone of its difficulties in mastering\r\nthese challenges.\r\nThe crises and conflicts in the world have not become\r\nfewer. This year’s report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nwork of the Organization describes, inter alia, the many\r\nquestions and problems that remain and to which the\r\nSecurity Council has not yet found satisfactory answers\r\nand solutions.\r\nUnder paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the Charter,\r\nMember States have conferred on the Security Council\r\nthe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security\r\n“In order to ensure prompt and effective action by\r\nthe United Nations”.\r\nPermit me to ask: Is the Security Council up to this task,\r\nconsidering its present composition and working methods?\r\nIn many ways the Kosovo conflict represents a\r\nturning point. I do not want to try to add new arguments\r\nto the focal issue of humanitarian intervention. The\r\ntension that exists between the sovereignty of States and\r\nthe universal applicability of human rights was addressed\r\nin a well balanced manner by the Secretary-General in his\r\ncontribution to the general debate. But in order to avoid\r\na Kosovo-type intervention in the future, we have to\r\nfinally carry out the long overdue substantial reform of\r\nthe Security Council. The Council must be adapted to the\r\nnew realities. It must, above all, be equipped adequately\r\nto react to the crises and conflicts of today in a legitimate\r\nmanner, truly on behalf of the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI would like to recall the address of German Foreign\r\nMinister Fischer at this session and the very concrete\r\nideas he laid out in his speech. He said of the Council:\r\n“Reform must involve enlargement to include\r\nboth more permanent and non-permanent members,\r\nas well as a strengthening of its decision-making\r\npowers...”\r\nIn the debate on reform we must not avoid the issue\r\nof the permanent members’ right of veto, a question of\r\nkey importance for the Security Council’s capability to\r\nact.\r\n“... The introduction of an obligation for a State\r\nto explain to the General Assembly why it is vetoing\r\na draft resolution would make it more difficult to do\r\nso and thus bring about substantial progress towards\r\nusing the right of veto more responsibly. Why\r\nshould not the General Assembly assume more\r\nresponsibility in future, too?” (A/54/PV.8, p. 12)\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nWe have to realize that without reform of the Security\r\nCouncil and its working methods, the legitimacy of the\r\nCouncil and its actions runs the risk of erosion and so will,\r\nultimately, the entire United Nations system.\r\nWhat we want is a significant, far-reaching and\r\nvisionary reform of the United Nations and its Security\r\nCouncil to master the problems of the next century.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil): I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe Security Council, Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, for his\r\nconcise presentation of the Council’s report to the General\r\nAssembly. As an elected member of the Council, we\r\nbelieve that efforts should continue to be made to ensure\r\nthat consideration of the report is not a mere formality. It\r\nshould be the basis for enhanced transparency and\r\naccountability by the Security Council. In this regard, and\r\nbearing in mind the current discussions on procedure and\r\nworking methods of the Security Council, Brazil advocates\r\nthe adoption of practices that bring the work of the Security\r\nCouncil closer to the general membership. Holding more\r\nfrequent private meetings may be a good way forward.\r\nHowever, other constructive ideas presently under\r\nconsideration by the Working Group on procedure and\r\ndocumentation should be pursued.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the newly-\r\nelected members of the Council: Bangladesh, Jamaica,\r\nMali, Tunisia and Ukraine. My delegation is sure that they\r\nare attuned to the expectations of the broad majority of the\r\nmembership that elected them, and will therefore endeavour\r\nto make a significant contribution to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThis has again been a very busy year for the Security\r\nCouncil. Unfortunately, this is not a cause for rejoicing. On\r\nthe contrary, it is an eloquent sign that the international\r\ncommunity has not been able to establish the peaceful,\r\nstable, just and prosperous society envisaged by the drafters\r\nof the Charter. The end of the millennium has not brought\r\nwith it the end of the horrors of wars and genocide.\r\nMassive killings, forced displacements, widespread\r\ndestruction and looting and other forms of violence have\r\nbecome sad reminders of the dark side of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\nDuring the period June 1998 to June 1999, we\r\nwitnessed the outbreak, persistence or deterioration of\r\nconflict situations in almost every continent. The challenge\r\nof dealing effectively with the international consequences\r\nof internal conflicts has been on the agenda of the Security\r\nCouncil daily. New crises have emerged in Africa, whereas\r\nlong-term conflicts — such as the 24-year civil war in\r\nAngola — still persist. The duration and complexity of\r\nconflicts in the African continent deserve urgent and\r\nconsistent attention by the Security Council.\r\nStability in the Balkans is yet to be achieved. The\r\nsituation in Kosovo represents a daunting challenge for\r\nthe international community. The Middle East remains an\r\narea of grave concern. The Council is still paralysed in\r\ndealing with the Iraq question. Asia continues to live\r\nunder the shadow of nuclear tests, and more recently has\r\nfaced the upsurge of violence in East Timor. In the midst\r\nof this turmoil, more than 21 million people —\r\nconsidered to be “of concern” by the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees — wander,\r\nwithout hope. Theirs is a distressing and real aspect of\r\nour times.\r\nWhile the overall picture is worrisome, the Security\r\nCouncil has been capable of addressing some of these\r\nquestions, within the limits of its responsibilities. We\r\nwould like to stress recent developments: in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, where the recent presidential and\r\nlegislative elections were held in a fair and orderly\r\nfashion; in Guinea-Bissau, which is preparing for\r\nelections, scheduled for 28 November; in Sierra Leone,\r\nwhere a peacekeeping operation will soon be deployed to\r\nhelp consolidate the peace process; and in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, where prospects for peace have\r\nimproved after the ceasefire agreement of Lusaka.\r\nThe Security Council is also preparing to engage in\r\nthe complex task of administering East Timor’s transition\r\nto independence. The importance of the free exercise by\r\nthe East Timorese people of their right to\r\nself-determination should not be underestimated. Brazil\r\nfollows very closely the situation in East Timor, with\r\nwhich we share a common language and cultural heritage.\r\nThe future state of East Timor will bear testimony to the\r\nmany lines of action open to the international community\r\nwithin the framework of the Charter — the leadership\r\nexercised by the Secretary-General when political\r\nconditions in Indonesia offered a window of opportunity;\r\nthe full backing of the Security Council at all stages of\r\nthe process; the use of various diplomatic tools, in\r\nparticular the innovative approach of a Security Council\r\nmission; the recognition that a “coalition of the willing”\r\nwas the best option, in that particular circumstance; the\r\nmandate given by the Security Council to the\r\nmultinational force; and the proposed transition to a\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation, in the full sense\r\nof the term, which we all hope will take place soon. The\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nlegal basis for all these actions is provided by the United\r\nNations Charter, whose full potential is yet to be explored.\r\nAnother good example of the many avenues offered by\r\nthe United Nations Charter is Haiti. In our comments under\r\nthis same item last year, we referred to Haiti as the one\r\nremaining item on the Council\u0027s agenda that dealt with a\r\ncountry in our region. We are glad to be able to do so\r\ntoday from a different perspective. In accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1212 (1998), the\r\nquestion of Haiti was addressed by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council at its last substantive session. Resolution\r\n1999/11 of the Economic and Social Council requests the\r\nSecretary-General to develop a long-term strategy and\r\nprogramme of support for Haiti. It could be argued that the\r\ncase of Haiti has set a useful precedent by focusing post-\r\nconflict peace-building actions on the economic and social\r\nconstraints underlying most political crises in the\r\ndeveloping world.\r\nDuring the period in question, we have also witnessed\r\na number of attempts to sideline the Security Council when\r\nit comes to maintaining peace and security. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself, speaking at The Hague on the occasion of\r\nthe centennial of the first International Peace Conference,\r\nidentified what he called a regrettable tendency for the\r\nSecurity Council not to be involved in efforts to maintain\r\npeace and security. Brazil deplores all instances in which\r\nenforcement action has been decided upon irrespective of\r\nSecurity Council authorization. Whenever this occurs, the\r\nvery foundations of international law are shaken. The\r\nalternative to the legitimacy provided by the United Nations\r\nCharter is an unstable order where might prevails over\r\nright.\r\nLooking at the bright side of the twentieth century, we\r\nsee signs of increasing convergence around a fundamental\r\ngroup of values. Tolerance, democracy, humanitarian\r\nprinciples, human rights and sustainable development are at\r\nthe core of our aspirations for a world system whose\r\nstability is founded on justice and not force. Our challenge\r\nnow is to transform this moral framework into institutions\r\nthat can act as the very foundations of international society.\r\nAgain, the alternative is to give way to war-making\r\npotential as the principal structuring force in society.\r\nMr. Monagas-Lesseur (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): My delegation would like to thank Ambassador\r\nSergey Lavrov for introducing the report of the Security\r\nCouncil for the period June 1998 to June 1999 in his\r\ncapacity as President of the Council for the month of\r\nOctober.\r\nVenezuela follows with the greatest interest the\r\ndevelopment of the substantive work of the Security\r\nCouncil in the exercise of its responsibilities, as well as\r\nthe evolution of its work regarding its procedures and the\r\ntransparency of its activities.\r\nWith regard to its substantive work, Venezuela\r\nreaffirms its support for the Security Council as the body\r\nwith the primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We are pleased to note\r\nthe important work accomplished during the year under\r\nconsideration, which has made it possible for the\r\nOrganization to consistently monitor many conflict\r\nsituations and to use its prevention, peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building capacities.\r\nSeen from the standpoint of both the number of\r\npeacekeeping operations and their complexity, these\r\nactivities also underscore the appropriateness of widening\r\nthe discussions regarding the expansion and reform of the\r\nCouncil. In the same measure as the Council is\r\nincreasingly making pronouncements and decisions of a\r\nbinding nature, we also see an increased need for the\r\nCouncil to strengthen its legitimacy through a presence of\r\nMember States within it that is consistent with the new\r\nrealities of Organization.\r\nWe also note with appreciation the Council\u0027s\r\nincreased interest in matters related to armed conflicts\r\nwhose gravity requires the attention of the international\r\ncommunity. These include the issues of children in\r\nconflict, protection for those providing assistance to\r\nrefugees, civilians in armed conflict and the threat of\r\nterrorist acts. The United Nations is called upon to enact\r\npreventive measures regarding these issues. The\r\ncontribution of the Council can and must be backed up by\r\nthe General Assembly in the search for general and stable\r\nsolutions to these problems.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping operations themselves,\r\nVenezuela supports the trend seen in the last year towards\r\ngreater cooperation with regional organizations in\r\naccordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter. Just as we\r\ncannot fail to share the concern expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization about those situations in which the Council\r\nwas not able to act and delegated its responsibilities,\r\nthereby creating a precedent that only weakens the legal\r\nfoundations of the collective security system, we also\r\nwish to affirm that we attach importance to the Councils\u0027\r\nkeeping situations under review until the expected results\r\nare achieved and peace is restored.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nRegarding the transparency of the work of the\r\nCouncil, Venezuela is following with heightened interest\r\nthe improvements made in its working methods. We\r\nsupport in particular the practice of holding consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing countries, the oral reports given by\r\nthe President and the holding of open meetings on matters\r\nof general interest. We especially commend the initiative of\r\ndealing in extenso with conflict situations in Africa during\r\nthe period covered by the report before us.\r\nA matter of particular relevance that we would like to\r\nsee carried further is the transparency of the work and\r\nreporting of the subsidiary bodies, in particular the\r\nsanctions committees. We are confident that improvements\r\ncan be made in this regard in order to have an objective\r\nassessment of the scope and consequences of existing\r\nsanctions regimes.\r\nFinally, we would like to reiterate the importance of\r\nthe General Assembly\u0027s Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nreform and expansion of the Security Council. We appeal\r\nto the Council to continue its efforts to improve the\r\ntransparency of its work and its working methods, including\r\nimprovements related to the presentation of its report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol (Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea): Since the Security Council is facing ever-increasing\r\nnew challenges and the current session is the last one of the\r\ntwentieth century, we believe it would be most appropriate\r\nfor the deliberation of the agenda item now before us to be\r\nseized as an opportunity to review comprehensively and in\r\nthe light of the United Nations Charter all aspects of the\r\nSecurity Council\u0027s activities in the course of the last half\r\ncentury.\r\nLet me now present some views on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe certainly take note, as we did last year, of some\r\nimprovements in the format of the report, such as the\r\ninclusion of, among other things, brief descriptions of every\r\ninformal consultation of the whole and monthly assessments\r\nof the work of the Security Council by former Presidents,\r\nin accordance with the measures approved by the Security\r\nCouncil in June 1997. We note in particular that the\r\ncontinued inclusion of monthly assessments in the form of\r\nan addendum to the report, although limited in their\r\ncontent, has to some extent contributed to improving the\r\nquality of the report and thus has helped the Member States\r\nunderstand instantly the activities of the Security Council\r\nduring the period under review.\r\nDespite these improvements, we regret to say that\r\nthe Report is still of a procedural nature. For example, 80\r\nper cent of the Security Council\u0027s activities are conducted\r\nthrough informal consultations. Hence, it would be logical\r\nthat the report should contain detailed and analytical\r\ninformation on informal consultations of the whole.\r\nHowever, the present report’s descriptions of the\r\ninformal consultations consist of only one or two\r\nparagraphs on the dates and proceedings of those\r\nconsultations. There is no information on the process of\r\ndeliberations, including the views of Security Council\r\nmembers on specific issues debated in the Council.\r\nSince the concept of informal consultations is not\r\nspecified either in the United Nations Charter or in the\r\nprovisional rules of procedure of the Security Council, the\r\ncontinuation of that process cannot be considered normal.\r\nMoreover, excluding the parties concerned from informal\r\nconsultations and failing to describe their proceedings in\r\ndetail runs counter to the demand of the majority of\r\nMember States to ensure transparency in Security Council\r\nactivities.\r\nAs our debates so far have clearly proved, the first\r\npriority in ensuring transparency in Security Council\r\nactivities is to make the Security Council discuss all\r\nsubstantive issues in public while confining its informal\r\nconsultations to those of a procedural nature.\r\nFurthermore, the parties concerned should be invited\r\nto participate in informal consultations as well as in\r\nformal meetings of the Security Council, in accordance\r\nwith Articles 31 and 32 of the United Nations Charter, so\r\nthat their views are duly reflected in the process of\r\ndeliberations of the Security Council.\r\nLet me also touch upon some of the challenges\r\nfacing the Security Council at the threshold of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nAlthough more than half a century has elapsed since\r\nthe Security Council started its work in the area of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, it is\r\nregrettable that the Council persists in taking actions that\r\ndisregard the purposes and principles enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and violate its mandate.\r\nIn 1950, in the early years after the inception of the\r\nUnited Nations, a certain arbitrariness existed that led to\r\nthe adoption, at Security Council meetings where all not\r\nall permanent members were represented, of resolutions\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nauthorizing the use of force. The leftover effects of those\r\nactions are still used to exploit the United Nations.\r\nMore recently, at the close of the twentieth century,\r\nthe world has witnessed other arbitrary acts, such as the use\r\nof military force against sovereign States without a clear\r\nmandate from the Security Council, or even bypassing the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBypassing the United Nations in the use of force\r\nconstitutes a serious violation of the United Nations Charter\r\nand commonly recognized international law, since this is\r\ntantamount to giving up on the commitment to confer on\r\nthe Security Council the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and the\r\ncommitment to respect the sovereign rights of Member\r\nStates.\r\nIf the principle of respect for sovereignty is\r\ndisregarded in relations among countries, confrontations\r\nwill inevitably occur between States trying to defend their\r\nsovereignty and forces attempting to infringe upon the\r\nsovereignty of other States, and, consequently, this world\r\nwill never be stable.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to make a contribution\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security and\r\nto the building of the peaceful world to which humankind\r\naspires, first, the principles of respect for sovereignty,\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States and\r\nmutual equality stipulated in the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational law should be strictly observed.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nSovereignty is the lifeline of every country.\r\nNon-intervention in the internal affairs of others and mutual\r\nequality are fundamental principles that should never be\r\nviolated on any account.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council should not take\r\nmeasures that might infringe upon the sovereignty of\r\nMember States. Infringing on the sovereignty of States and\r\nintervening in their internal affairs should not be allowed.\r\nThirdly, in order for Security Council resolutions to be\r\neffectively implemented, a system should be established\r\nthat would empower the General Assembly to endorse\r\nSecurity Council resolutions concerning crucial issues such\r\nas the use of force and economic sanctions.\r\nLastly, the Security Council should review the\r\nimplementation of all resolutions adopted in the past and\r\neliminate what is left over from the cold-war era by\r\ntaking courageous steps to correct those that contravene\r\nthe United Nations Charter and are inconsistent with\r\npresent times.\r\nIn this regard, I take this opportunity to remind all\r\npresent here that around 40,000 United States troops\r\nstationed in South Korea are pretending to be United\r\nNations forces by exploiting the United Nations flag and\r\nhelmets.\r\nIn conclusion, it is my delegation’s hope that the\r\nconstructive proposals suggested with regard to Security\r\nCouncil activities will be given serious consideration\r\nduring the Millennium Assembly and Summit, to be held\r\nnext year.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to convey the congratulations of my delegation\r\nto Ambassador Lavrov of the Russian Federation, who, as\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober, has submitted to us the annual report of the\r\nCouncil, in keeping with Article 24, paragraph 3, of the\r\nCharter.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute\r\nto the members of the Council for the high quality,\r\nrelevance and balance of the report, which accurately\r\nreflect their commitment and their devotion to\r\ninternational peace and security, an area for which the\r\nSecurity Council has primary responsibility.\r\nAs is clear from the report, the Council, once again,\r\nhas had a very busy year because of the many upheavals\r\nthroughout the world and the frequent threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. The report represents the\r\nsum of the efforts made by Council members and by the\r\nSecretariat, and it is also an important stage in making the\r\nwork of the Council more open and more transparent.\r\nProgress has been made in recent years with respect\r\nto the need for greater transparency in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council, and we appreciate the well-established\r\npractice of making available information to non-members\r\nof the Council. My delegation welcomes the holding of\r\nopen debates on various items on the Council’s agenda as\r\nwell as the initiatives taken by Presidents to organize\r\npublic meetings on specific issues of concern to the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nEach President tries, during his monthly term of\r\noffice, to organize a debate on a major theme. This is a\r\nwelcome innovation, and we cannot but support this trend\r\nvery strongly.\r\nMember States were thus able to express their views\r\non important issues such as threats to peace and security\r\ncaused by international terrorist acts; protection for\r\nhumanitarian assistance to refugees and others affected by\r\nconflict situations; the maintenance of peace and security\r\nand post-conflict peace-building; protection of civilians in\r\narmed conflict; the question of child soldiers; and the\r\nproblem of displaced persons.\r\nThe report of the Security Council also gives a\r\nprominent place to the crises convulsing Africa, the\r\ncontinent that currently has more conflicts on the agenda of\r\nthe Council than any other, including those in Angola,\r\nBurundi, Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nSierra Leone and Somalia.\r\nSince the issuance in April 1998 of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on conflict in Africa, the instability in the\r\ncontinent has prompted the Council, in the course of several\r\nmeetings, to consider the crises that have convulsed Africa,\r\nas well as the proposals of the ad hoc Working Group set\r\nup to consider the recommendations contained in that\r\nreport. That Working Group, which is chaired by the\r\nAmbassador of Gabon, to whom I convey fraternal\r\ncongratulations, submitted its conclusions to the Security\r\nCouncil, which adopted them unanimously in the form of\r\nresolutions and presidential statements during September\r\nand November 1998.\r\nIn those various decisions, the Security Council\r\ndefined the principles for assuring and safeguarding peace\r\nand advocated several different means and mechanisms for\r\ndoing so, such as arms embargoes, cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity with\r\nregard to Africa’s peacekeeping capacity, security in\r\nrefugee camps, illicit arms trafficking and the strengthening\r\nof peace through the efforts of regional organizations. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the laudable efforts made by the\r\nCouncil to contain those conflicts, because without peace\r\nthere can be no development in Africa.\r\nWe must remain vigilant and remember, as African\r\nleaders have repeatedly emphasized from this rostrum, that\r\nAfrica needs real action to be taken, not fine-sounding\r\ndeclarations and resolutions. The importance that the\r\ninternational community attaches to Africa will be\r\nmeasured by concrete, positive action.\r\nIn a number of African crises, the hesitation of the\r\nSecurity Council and, too often, its failure to act, have led\r\nto great frustration on the part of African States. In the\r\ninterests of peace and the development of the continent,\r\nthe Security Council should first and foremost support the\r\nefforts of Africans to strengthen their peacekeeping\r\ncapacity so that they are able to confront such crisis\r\nsituations.\r\nWe have also observed too great a tendency on the\r\npart of the members of the Council to allow situations to\r\ndeteriorate to the point of causing great loss of life and,\r\noften, large-scale humanitarian disaster. The attention that\r\ncertain members of the council have said that they will\r\nnow pay to African problems — after the lessons of\r\nKosovo and East Timor — will be measured by their\r\nability to anticipate unfortunate events in Africa and to\r\ntake adequate preventive action. Members of the Security\r\nCouncil have too great a tendency to react belatedly to\r\ncrises, whereas, when confronted with tragic situations in\r\nAfrica, they should act quickly, before it is too late. We\r\nhave even observed that, in contrast to similar\r\nhumanitarian situations occurring outside the continent,\r\nresponses to situations in Africa have often been delayed\r\nto such an extent that we sometimes wonder whether\r\npeople in distress in Africa are treated on an equal footing\r\nwith people in other parts of the world.\r\nIn order to prevent the Security Council’s failure to\r\nact when confronted with such situations from having the\r\nserious consequence of gravely damaging the credibility\r\nand authority of that central body, there must be an\r\nimprovement in the way in which it functions. In this\r\ncontext, I wish to emphasize and welcome the broad\r\nconsensus that already exists with regard to some\r\nessential issues, including the participation of non-\r\nmembers in Council meetings, the programme of work of\r\nthe Council and the briefings arranged by the President of\r\nthe Council for non-members and troop contributors.\r\nWe must go further, and turn this impetus into true\r\nprogress by institutionalizing it so that international peace\r\nand security in the next century can be upheld by a\r\nrevitalized, more effective and more transparent Security\r\nCouncil. To that end, we must stop this deplorable trend\r\nof sidelining the Security Council. Indeed, for some time,\r\nMember States and regional organizations have been\r\ntaking coercive measures without the authorization of the\r\nCouncil, or have been acting unilaterally in the name of\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nthe right to intervene on humanitarian grounds. The support\r\nthat regional organizations can provide in conflict\r\nprevention or peacekeeping should never absolve the\r\nCouncil of its overriding responsibility for the promotion of\r\npeace and collective security.\r\nWe must therefore discourage this trend by\r\nemphasizing the areas of competence defined by the\r\nCharter so that at the dawn of the new millennium we will\r\nhave a Security Council that is in step with our changing\r\nworld, one that respects the sovereignty of States and can\r\ndemonstrate imagination and determination in protecting\r\nhuman rights and safeguarding peace throughout the world.\r\nMr. Onyia (Nigeria): It is an honour and, indeed, a\r\ndelight for me to echo the very warm congratulations which\r\nmy President extended to Mr. Gurirab, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, when he addressed the Assembly last\r\nmonth. Mr. Gurirab’s outstanding leadership is already\r\nradiating through the deliberations of the fifty-fourth\r\nsession, and the Nigerian delegation assures him of its\r\ncontinuous support.\r\nWe thank Ambassador Sergey Lavrov of the Russian\r\nFederation — the current President of the Council — for\r\nintroducing the report this morning. May I also express our\r\ngratitude to the Secretariat for its effort in producing the\r\ncomprehensive report.\r\nThis agenda item provides us with ample opportunity\r\nto examine the many activities of the Security Council, the\r\nprincipal organ charged with the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, during the period under\r\nreview. This debate is of crucial importance because it is\r\nthe last deliberation on this issue in this century. Indeed, the\r\nactivities of the Security Council deserve our special\r\nattention as we are at the dawn of the new millennium.\r\nWe would like to commend the Security Council for\r\nits significant achievements in the resolution of conflicts in\r\nvarious regions of the world, especially since the end of the\r\ncold war. In Africa, the efforts of the Security Council were\r\nparticularly important for the independence of Namibia, the\r\nsuccessful dismantling of apartheid in South Africa, the end\r\nof conflict in Mozambique and support for the peacemaking\r\nefforts in Liberia of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG).\r\nNotwithstanding those important achievements, there are\r\nstill other areas where the Security Council needs to\r\ndemonstrate greater commitment and decisiveness in\r\nresolving conflicts afflicting some States in Africa, as has\r\nbeen done in other regions.\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General on the causes\r\nof conflict and promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (S/1998/318) has\r\nmanifestly shown, the root causes of conflict in Africa are\r\nvaried and complex. Contemporary conflict situations in\r\nour continent reveal that they arise from multifarious\r\nfactors that relate to poverty and socio-economic\r\nimbalances in society. It is against this background that\r\nwe welcome the meetings of the Security Council at\r\nministerial level on the situation in Africa. It is clear from\r\nthose meetings that lasting solutions to conflict situations\r\nin Africa require far-reaching initiatives and solutions\r\nwhich link peace, security, good governance, respect for\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law on the one hand to\r\nsustainable development on the other.\r\nThe role of ECOWAS in restoring peace in Liberia\r\nand in Sierra Leone is indicative of the important\r\ncontribution that a subregional organization can make to\r\ninternational peace and security. The success of\r\nECOMOG confirms that such regional initiatives, where\r\nthey exist, stand a good chance of success if their\r\npeacemaking and peacekeeping efforts are adequately and\r\npromptly supported by the Security Council. This success,\r\nhowever, has come at a tremendous cost to the States of\r\nthe subregion, particularly my country. Our experience\r\nreinforces our belief that ECOWAS has evolved a unique\r\nmechanism for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution.\r\nRegrettably, there is a general perception that a\r\nuniform standard is lacking in responding to the outbreak\r\nof conflicts in all parts of the world. The Security Council\r\nhas been slow to respond to the outbreak of conflicts in\r\nour continent — and where it has responded on time, it\r\nhas not shown adequate commitment in terms of the\r\nmeasures and resources it has authorized to address these\r\nproblems.\r\nPeace is indivisible. We therefore urge the Security\r\nCouncil to place conflicts in Africa on the same footing\r\nas those in other regions, because the consequences of\r\ninaction can be very catastrophic, as has been amply\r\ndemonstrated in Rwanda.\r\nOne of the critical challenges facing the United\r\nNations as we approach the new millennium is the reform\r\nand democratization of the Security Council. In this\r\nregard, we reiterate the necessity of urgent reform of the\r\nCouncil and its working methods in order to enhance the\r\nCouncil\u0027s transparency, legitimacy and effectiveness.\r\nNigeria has consistently maintained that the present\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nsituation, in which Africa, with 53 States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, has no permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil, is unacceptable. In addition, such reform must\r\nresult in enhancing not only cooperation between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, but also its\r\neffectiveness.\r\nWhile it is true that conflicts in Africa result from\r\nprevailing political and socio-cultural conditions, it is\r\nequally true that so long as Africa is not fully integrated\r\ninto the global economic system, and so long as its people\r\ncontinue to be ravaged by poverty, disease and an\r\nunsustainable debt burden, genuine peace and security will\r\nremain an illusion on the continent. Nigeria, therefore,\r\nurges the United Nations to adopt a more holistic strategy\r\nin its plans to enhance conflict prevention and management,\r\nand to ensure rapid economic development, which are\r\nnecessary conditions for stability, growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nLet me use this opportunity to congratulate the non-\r\npermanent members of the Council elected for the period\r\n2000-2001, namely Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and\r\nUkraine.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate Nigeria\u0027s commitment\r\nto the principles and purposes of the United Nations\r\nCharter, and to assure the Assembly that my country will\r\nspare no effort in the pursuit of global peace and security.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I wish first of\r\nall to thank Ambassador Sergey V. Lavrov, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation and President of\r\nthe Security Council for the month of October, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Council to the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation is particularly pleased that the\r\nexperiment begun some years ago by Brazil is now a\r\nregular practice at the outset of the General Assembly\u0027s\r\nconsideration of this agenda item.\r\nThe report of the Security Council for the period 16\r\nJune 1998 to 15 June 1999, which is before the Assembly\r\ntoday, contains a chronology of the formal activities of the\r\nCouncil and a compilation of resolutions adopted and\r\npresidential statements issued during the reporting period.\r\nIt constitutes a valuable reference tool for librarians and\r\narchivists. In a concise and orderly format, it contains\r\nreferences to documentation, resolutions, statements and\r\nagenda items considered by the Council during the\r\nreporting period.\r\nIn spite of each year\u0027s improvements in the way the\r\nreport is set out, my delegation believes that much\r\nremains to be done for the information in the report to\r\nmeet completely the Council\u0027s obligation to submit a\r\ncomplete and appropriate report on its activities to the\r\nother Members of the United Nations.\r\nI want to reaffirm once again that, rather than a\r\ncompilation and a chronological account, we would be\r\ninterested in an analysis of what took place during the\r\nCouncil\u0027s deliberations and an explanation of the\r\nreasoning behind its decisions. This is not a trivial matter;\r\nit is part of the Council\u0027s duty to report to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nRule 48 of the Security Council\u0027s provisional rules\r\nof procedure clearly states that, unless it decides\r\notherwise, the Council shall meet in public. But custom\r\nhas turned the exception to that rule into a general\r\npractice. With increasing frequency, the Council meets\r\nbehind closed doors in informal consultations, a format\r\nwhich is certainly not envisioned in the provisional rules\r\nof procedure.\r\nFor the period covered by the report before us, out\r\nof a total of 360 meetings, only 121 were held publicly,\r\nwhereas 239 — almost twice as many — were held in\r\nprivate. Public meetings constitute the only opportunity\r\nthat we 173 countries not on the Security Council have to\r\nbe heard in an organ which, by provision of the Charter\r\nitself, is to act on behalf of us all. The private, informal\r\nconsultations, supposedly designed to deal with questions\r\nof procedure, are now the forum in which the real\r\nsubstantive work of the Council is carried out. For that\r\nreason, it is inexplicable that no information is included\r\nabout those private meetings, which according to the\r\nreport itself represented approximately 511 work hours for\r\nthe Council.\r\nUnder the terms of the Charter, it is important for\r\nthe General Assembly to know the substance of the\r\nconsultations in which the Council debates and prepares\r\ndecisions which subsequently must be accepted and\r\nimplemented by all States Members of the United\r\nNations, who have delegated to that organ the\r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. From us it receives its mandate, and to us it\r\nmust respond. The process of accountability is part of any\r\nprocess that is in any way democratic.\r\nThe silence of the report regarding the case of\r\nKosovo is eloquent. That conflict held the attention of our\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nGovernments and of public opinion for a large part of this\r\nyear. We all know what happened in the public meetings of\r\nthe Council. What we do not know is what led to the total\r\nmarginalization of the Council in the handling of the\r\nconflict. The substantive deliberations were conducted not\r\nonly behind closed doors, but were also limited, in absolute\r\nsecrecy, to the inner circle of the five permanent members.\r\nIt is incomprehensible to my delegation that the report does\r\nnot contain an analytical account of the reasons why the\r\nCouncil abdicated in favour of a military alliance to which\r\nthree of its five permanent members belong, an action\r\ncontrary to the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nWe urge the members of the Security Council to\r\nconduct their substantive work in public. This is not some\r\ngenerous concession they would be making to the other\r\nMembers of the United Nations; rather it is a matter of\r\ncomplying fully not only with their own rules but with the\r\nethical imperative of legitimacy.\r\nWe will not embark here on an analysis of the\r\nworking methods of the Council, nor will we refer to the\r\nanachronistic privileges enjoyed by some of its members.\r\nThis is under consideration in the open-ended working\r\ngroup of the General Assembly on Security Council reform.\r\nWe will confine ourselves to pointing out that the lack of\r\ntransparency and the extreme inequalities that prevail in the\r\nCouncil have made it, instead of a protagonist and advocate\r\nin the search for solutions for international conflicts, rather\r\na politically correct observer of the exercise of global\r\npower.\r\nAs Article 24 of the Charter indicates, the Security\r\nCouncil is an organ conceived and designed to “ensure\r\nprompt and effective action by the United Nations”. Its\r\npowers refer specifically to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Its responsibility consists of taking the\r\nnecessary measures in a timely way to avoid the worsening\r\nof situations of conflict. If we make an analogy with the\r\nstructure of a State, the Security Council is a form of the\r\nexecutive branch.\r\nThe Security Council is not a deliberative body and it\r\nlacks the power to enact provisions of a normative nature\r\nthat are generally applicable. That is the purview of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the most representative organ of the\r\ninternational community, whose broad competence allows\r\nit to “discuss any questions or any matters within the scope\r\nof the present Charter”, as Article 10 provides; it “may\r\nconsider the general principles of cooperation in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security”, or\r\n“discuss any questions relating to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security”, as established in Article\r\n11. In fact, it can discuss any other issue as stipulated by\r\nArticle 13. If action is required in the framework of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s competence, then the Security\r\nCouncil will intervene.\r\nThe division of responsibility is clear: if we compare\r\nthe Security Council to a limited form of executive\r\npower, that is, an action-oriented organ, then the General\r\nAssembly is the legislative authority, the organ for\r\ndeliberation and the establishment of general norms.\r\nMy delegation is concerned by the trend in the\r\nCouncil in recent years toward making declarations of a\r\ngeneral nature on issues of collective concern in an\r\nattempt to provide automatic legitimacy for its own\r\nactions. Let us respect the respective competence of each\r\nof the principal organs of the United Nations. It is up to\r\nthe Assembly to deliberate and to establish norms and\r\nprinciples regarding contemporary problems. It is up to\r\nthe Security Council to act in case of crisis and, above\r\nall, on a case by case basis.\r\nThe Mexican delegation reiterates that access to\r\ninformation is a right of all Members of the United\r\nNations and not a privilege, as some would seem to\r\nbelieve. It is the obligation of the members of the\r\nSecurity Council to keep others appropriately informed of\r\nthe matters that the Council examines and on the reasons\r\nwhy the Council members make their decisions. We\r\ninvite the Council, particularly its five permanent\r\nmembers, to join in the irreversible process toward\r\nopenness, transparency and reform of the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council, to which my country is\r\ncompletely committed, as are the immense majority of\r\nMember States of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Fowler (Canada) (spoke in French): Canada\r\nwelcomes this opportunity to discuss the work of the\r\nSecurity Council with the all the Members of the United\r\nNations. The opportunities for dialogue between the\r\nCouncil and those to whom it is accountable are too rare.\r\nTo Canada, as an elected member of the Council, such\r\naccountability seems obvious. We argued for it during our\r\ncampaign, and in the Council we are promoting the\r\napplicability of the concepts of responsibility and\r\naccountability. Our position has always been based not\r\nonly on the inherent merit of a more open, transparent\r\nand responsive Council, but also on practical\r\nconsiderations of effectiveness. The Council can only\r\nbenefit from greater interaction with those who must\r\nultimately give effect to its decisions.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nThe sheer size of the report before us underlines the\r\nunprecedented volume of Council activity. The impressive\r\nnumber of security issues of which the Council is seized —\r\nalbeit a reminder of the number of conflicts raging\r\nthroughout the world — demonstrates, nevertheless, the\r\nwelcome activism of the Council since the end of the cold\r\nwar. We also note with satisfaction the increase in the\r\nnumber of thematic debates on cross-cutting, emerging\r\nsecurity issues. Canada was pleased to contribute to this\r\ntrend with an initiative on the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict. Such initiatives enable the\r\nCouncil to consider key peace and security issues in a\r\nbroader context and in a more comprehensive manner than\r\nits usual crisis\r\nmode allows. In addition, these initiatives have helped\r\nmove the Council towards a broader definition of security.\r\nThe report also registers important milestones in the\r\nCouncil’s work, such as the suspension of sanctions against\r\nLibya and the authorization of new United Nations\r\nMissions in East Timor and Kosovo.\r\nWe are, however, struck by what is not included in the\r\nmore than 400 pages of the report. The inability of the\r\nCouncil to address a number of key security issues this past\r\nyear is cause for deep concern. Crises in which Council\r\naction is blocked by lack of agreement among the five\r\npermanent members — for example, the crisis in Kosovo\r\n— or where deep divisions persist, such as with regard to\r\nIraq, undermine the Council’s effectiveness. Political and\r\npolicy differences must be overcome in the name of the\r\ncollective interest; the threat or use of the veto must give\r\nway to more vigorous efforts to find consensus.\r\nEqually troubling is the persistent trend towards\r\nallowing financial considerations to drive or dominate\r\ndecision-making on whether and how to respond to clear\r\nthreats to international peace and security. Too often this\r\nattitude has hindered resolute action and resulted in reliance\r\non others — often those least capable of paying — to\r\nimplement the Council’s sometimes imperfectly articulated\r\nwill. The Security Council’s proud tradition of\r\npeacekeeping must not be allowed to fade as a result of\r\nfinancial starvation, bureaucratic atrophy or mere disuse.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe must also learn from our mistakes and take stock\r\nof what works and what does not.\r\nTrust funds established to finance multinational forces,\r\nauthorized by the Council to replace United Nations\r\npeacekeeping missions funded through accepted assessment\r\nmechanisms, simply do not work. Most recently, they\r\nhave not worked for the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in Sierra\r\nLeone, nor for the International Force for East Timor. In\r\nSierra Leone, only $2 million was deposited into the trust\r\nfund; this sum did not cover even three days of\r\nECOMOG operations. Given this track record, there is no\r\nreason to expect that trust funds will work in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo or anywhere else.\r\nObviously, Japan’s generous contribution of $100\r\nmillion to the East Timor trust fund is a significant —\r\nperhaps unique — exception, but even such a contribution\r\nwill go only a very limited way towards defraying the\r\nhuge costs of this important peacekeeping operation.\r\nTroop contributors will be left to pick up the lion’s share\r\nof the bill, and this is not how it is supposed to work.\r\nECOMOG has done outstanding and thankless work in\r\nSierra Leone, taking large numbers of casualties in\r\nappallingly difficult circumstances, daring to go into\r\nharm’s way when few others were prepared to do so, and\r\nthereby bringing some measure of stability to parts of the\r\ncountry. Nigeria — the principal contributor of troops and\r\nbearer of costs — has said it can no longer shoulder such\r\na burden. We will, nevertheless, dispatch a hybrid force\r\nto Sierra Leone within which the ECOMOG component\r\nis still to be funded by passing the hat which we — the\r\ninternational community — will fail yet again to fill.\r\nThe reality of the restraints and constraints on\r\ngovernment financing in almost every part of the world is\r\nsuch that the enormous costs of peacekeeping, on almost\r\nany scale, simply cannot be met by voluntary\r\ncontributions. Our Governments, with varying degrees of\r\nenthusiasm, accept their obligations under the United\r\nNations Charter to pay formally assessed peacekeeping\r\ncosts on the basis of the agreed scale of assessments.\r\nThey have not voted — and, I predict, will not vote —\r\nany significant amount of what our finance ministries\r\nwould term “discretionary” spending for peacekeeping\r\nmissions that are not commanded and mandated by the\r\nUnited Nations; in other words, for missions that are not\r\nclassic United Nations peacekeeping operations. This is,\r\nafter all, the essence of collective security.\r\nPeace and security are fundamental, core\r\nresponsibilities of this Organization. They cannot and\r\nshould not be subcontracted or otherwise farmed out to\r\nregional associations or ad hoc groups of countries willing\r\nto take on such large commitments of financial and\r\nhuman resources. Of course, regional organizations and\r\nkey regional players will continue to play a fundamentally\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nimportant leadership role in many peacekeeping operations,\r\nbut the goal of a universal United Nations mandate, as long\r\nas it is obtainable, remains of paramount importance to the\r\nprinciples on which this Organization is founded, and ought\r\nto remain our objective in all situations where collective\r\naction to maintain or restore the peace is called for.\r\nThanks to the Secretary-General’s insightful and, from\r\nour Canadian perspective, very welcome statement at the\r\nopening of this year’s general debate, a dialogue has been\r\nlaunched among Member States on essential questions\r\nrelating to the mission and the mandate of the United\r\nNations generally, and the Security Council in particular, as\r\nthe United Nations pursues its peace and security vocation.\r\nThe Secretary-General successfully combined hard truths\r\nabout the recent failures of collective security with a\r\nchallenging vision for the future. That vision, which places\r\nhuman security at the centre of our work, is fully shared by\r\nCanada. The key challenge, that of elaborating the factors\r\nof when and how to intervene to protect civilians in armed\r\nconflict, is one which this Organization must be ready to\r\nmeet.\r\nOn the Council, Canada has argued that humanitarian\r\nprinciples and human rights should be given greater weight\r\nin the Security Council\u0027s calculus of when and how to act,\r\nnot only because of their direct impact on the peace and\r\nsecurity equation, but also as standards which ought to be\r\nenforced on their own merits. The principles of state\r\nsovereignty and human security must be more readily\r\nreconciled in practice. As recent events have shown, failure\r\nto do so risks sidelining the Council in addressing today\u0027s\r\nconflicts.\r\nWork towards this new definition of security must be\r\naccompanied by updated working methods, greater\r\ntransparency and much less secrecy. Canada and the other\r\nelected members have done their part to open up the\r\nCouncil\u0027s working methods to broader scrutiny through\r\nregular briefings for interested non-members and, under\r\nCanada\u0027s presidency, the posting of a wealth of information\r\non the Council\u0027s activities on our mission website.\r\nTo enhance the Council\u0027s effectiveness, we believe that\r\nthere ought to be more scope for the participation of non-\r\nmembers in the Council\u0027s deliberations — whether formal\r\nor informal — when their presence could make a useful\r\ncontribution to the Council\u0027s efforts to prevent and control\r\nconflict. We believe the Council should hold more open\r\nmeetings. We consider that the Council ought to make more\r\nimaginative and more innovative use of other formats that\r\ngo well beyond the “Arria formula” in order to permit more\r\ninclusive involvement of non-members and a better\r\ninformed airing of views before far-reaching decisions are\r\ntaken. The Council\u0027s decisions and procedures must\r\nreinforce the search for peace, not just the prerogatives of\r\nthe most powerful. We hope that next year\u0027s report and\r\nothers to follow will reflect progress on these fronts.\r\nWe look forward to working closely with the newly\r\nelected members of the Security Council, who will bring\r\nnew ideas and fresh perspectives to our deliberations. We\r\nwill miss, of course, the five departing members, who so\r\ngenerously offered us wise advice from the very moment\r\nwe joined their number at the beginning of this year. Two\r\nyears is not a long time to get the kinds of changes\r\nproposed by so many speakers today brought to the way\r\nthe Council does business. Such changes will, however,\r\nremain elusive unless the pressure for change can be\r\nsustained from one group of elected members to the next.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador Sergey\r\nLavrov of the Russian Federation, for his eloquent and\r\nobjective presentation of this year\u0027s report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly. Indeed, as a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council, Namibia\r\nattaches great importance to this practice, which has now\r\nbeen in effect for seven years.\r\nIt is clear from the report that a lot of time has been\r\ndevoted to African issues during the period under review.\r\nNevertheless, Africa continues to be beset by mounting\r\nand pressing problems, which require concerted efforts on\r\nthe part of the Security Council and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nThe Security Council has been supportive of regional\r\nefforts aimed at conflict resolution on the continent.\r\nHowever, we believe that resolution of these problems\r\nshould not be the sole responsibility of Africans. The\r\nSecurity Council has to take its responsibility and not\r\ndelegate it to any subregional or regional group if the\r\ncredibility of that international body is to be preserved.\r\nIn the aftermath of conflicts, it is important to\r\nembark on post-conflict peace-building measures. It is\r\nequally important that emphasis be placed on prevention\r\nand minimizing recurrence.\r\nAfrica is determined to promote the use of peaceful\r\nmeans in the resolution of conflicts engulfing the\r\ncontinent. The Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nResolution is a valuable asset for our continent and must be\r\nnurtured, supported and consolidated. The Mechanism\r\nsymbolizes the concrete resolve of our continent to fully\r\nassume its responsibility. To this end, the OAU will need\r\nthe full cooperation of States Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nBy adopting resolutions 1234 (1999) and 1258 (1999),\r\nfor example, the Security Council has taken the first steps\r\nin addressing the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. We look forward to the full deployment of a United\r\nNations peacekeeping operation in that country to facilitate\r\nthe implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe imminent adoption of the Security Council\r\nresolution to deploy 6,000 military personnel in Sierra\r\nLeone will stabilize the situation in that country and give\r\npeace a chance. We look forward to a speedy deployment\r\nof this peacekeeping operation. Other situations in Africa\r\nshould equally be addressed.\r\nThe Secretary-General has not wavered in his efforts\r\nto address African problems. In addition, last year the\r\nSecurity Council held the biennial ministerial meeting on\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s report on Africa, at which and\r\nsubsequent to which resolutions and presidential statements\r\nwere adopted. It is our sincere hope that the\r\nrecommendations contained in these resolutions and\r\nstatements will be implemented by the Secretariat, Member\r\nStates and other stakeholders.\r\nThe plight of civilians, and in particular of children in\r\narmed conflict, has received due consideration by the\r\nSecurity Council. We are gratified that the suffering of\r\nthese silent members of society has been recognized and\r\nthat the Security Council and all relevant United Nations\r\nbodies continue with their efforts to address their plight.\r\nThe question of the reform of the Security Council is\r\ncentral to the efficacy, credibility and authority of the\r\nCouncil. Although some progress has been made in\r\nenhancing transparency and accessibility in the work of the\r\nCouncil, much remains to be done. Transparency will not\r\nhinder the work of the Council; it can only enhance its\r\nactivities.\r\nNamibia\u0027s position with regard to the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is clear. We favour an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council to reflect the reality of the dramatic\r\nincrease of the United Nations membership, which stands\r\nat 188 as of September this year.\r\nWe welcome Mali and Tunisia, which were recently\r\nelected to the Council, and wish to thank the Gambia and\r\nGabon for their invaluable contributions to the work of\r\nthe Council. Similarly, we look forward to working\r\ntogether with Bangladesh, Jamaica and Ukraine in\r\ncarrying out the responsibilities of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): It is an honour to\r\naddress the Members of the United Nations on the report\r\n(A/54/2) of the Security Council. I wish to thank the\r\ncurrent President of the Security Council, Ambassador\r\nLavrov of the Russian Federation, for introducing the\r\nreport. In addition, I wish to thank the members of the\r\nSecurity Council for the effort that went into the\r\nproduction of such a comprehensive report.\r\nThe report of the Security Council shows that over\r\nthe past year the Council has struggled to come to grips\r\nwith a wide range of both long-standing and new conflicts\r\nwhose tragic effects, especially on civilians, and scope\r\nand complexity have profoundly threatened the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe report shows that the Security Council\u0027s ability,\r\nand even willingness, to address conflicts timeously,\r\nconsistently and impartially has been sorely tested. This\r\ndeficiency, as stated by the Secretary-General in his\r\nstatement to the Assembly, is nothing less than a\r\nreflection of our inability to reconcile the need for\r\nuniversal legitimacy with the need to effectively defend\r\nhuman rights.\r\nIt is therefore understandable, given the past record\r\nof our collective failures, most notably in Africa in places\r\nlike Angola, Rwanda and Somalia, that some events over\r\nthe course of this past year would have led many, if not\r\nmost, of the Members of the United Nations to expect the\r\nworst.\r\nBut at the same time the Council continued its\r\nattempts to expand the transparency of its work by,\r\namongst other things, holding more open meetings on a\r\nrange of important issues. We trust these steps represent\r\na recognition on the part of the Council of the importance\r\nof maintaining a sustained and transparent dialogue with\r\nthe broader membership of the United Nations on the key\r\nissues affecting global peace and security.\r\nFor this trend to be meaningful, however, the\r\nCouncil will have to move beyond the practice of\r\nfocusing on thematic issues alone in open debates — and\r\nI am not saying these are not important — towards\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nregular, open discussions which focus on practical ways to\r\naddress specific conflicts, and more important, potential\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn short, the Council needs to regularly consult with\r\nthe membership. The alternative, the continuation of the\r\n“business as usual” approach, does not look good.\r\nIn this context, over the past year the many instances\r\nin which the Council appeared unable to cohesively address\r\nconflict issues gave us little confidence. Here I am thinking\r\nof the many controversies which characterized the Council\u0027s\r\napproach to such issues as Kosovo, Libyan sanctions, the\r\ndeadlock over Iraq, the descent into violence in East Timor\r\nand the largest conventional wars in Africa since the end of\r\nthe Second World War, between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and\r\nin and around the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nGiven this environment, many members were led,\r\nonce again, to legitimately question the ongoing relevance\r\nand capacity of the Security Council, and the illogical and\r\npatriarchal nature of its current composition and distribution\r\nof powers.\r\nPresident Mbeki underlined these concerns in his\r\nstatement to the General Assembly last month, when he\r\nsaid:\r\n“the requirement on the United Nations ... to prevent\r\nthe outbreak of hostilities imposes an obligation on the\r\nUnited Nations that it should be seen by Governments\r\nand peoples as a truly even-handed interlocutor and\r\npeacemaker.” (A/54/PV.4, p. 9)\r\nMore recently, however, I am pleased to say that there\r\nhave been some promising signals. Positive developments\r\nand accomplishments in Kosovo and East Timor have been\r\naccompanied by further encouraging signs that the Security\r\nCouncil may intend to approach other conflicts, especially\r\nin Africa, with the necessary level of attention and\r\ndetermination, combined with an appropriate mandate,\r\nwhich recently proved so critical in addressing the questions\r\nof Kosovo and East Timor.\r\nThis positive new trend on the part of the Council, if\r\nit is allowed to progress beyond words into action, is in\r\nitself a constructive and appropriate response to an equal\r\ndetermination on the part of Africa, and its regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, to take charge of our own\r\ndestiny through regional interventions to resolve conflicts\r\nin Sierra Leone, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nand in Burundi.\r\nAll that we ask, not unreasonably, is that the United\r\nNations support these indigenous endeavours collectively\r\nby taking appropriate and meaningful action, at the\r\nappropriate time and as determined by the continent. It is\r\nespecially important that the region\u0027s sincere undertakings\r\nin conflict prevention and resolution are thereafter\r\nsupported by the proper Security Council mandate.\r\nSouth Africa trusts that in the days, weeks and\r\nmonths to come this emergent new dialogue between the\r\nAfrican continent and the Security Council will prove to\r\nbe sustainable, and will prove central to bringing lasting\r\npeace to Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, and to other conflicts that the continent is still in\r\nthe process of addressing.\r\nFor our part, as Africans we are striving to ensure\r\nthat the search for indigenous solutions to conflicts in\r\nAfrica\u0027s regions is accompanied by local initiatives to\r\nstrengthen the democratic character of national and\r\nregional institutions, the culture of respect for human\r\nrights and the related areas of better governance and\r\nsustainable policies for economic and social development.\r\nIt is our earnest hope also that if a new spirit of\r\ncooperation and accountability comes to characterize the\r\nSecurity Council\u0027s current interactions with Member\r\nStates, this same spirit will find expression in the debate\r\non the reform of the composition and working methods of\r\nthe Security Council over the next year.\r\nOur future successes or failures in preventing and\r\nending conflicts will depend largely on the collective will\r\nand action of the Members of the United Nations and, in\r\nparticular, on a Security Council that is appropriately\r\nrepresentative of the membership.\r\nAs President Mbeki stated, it will require “moral and\r\nintellectual courage” to rise to the challenge.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): My delegation welcomes this\r\nopportunity to consider the report of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly covering the period from 16\r\nJune 1998 to 15 June 1999. We express our appreciation\r\nto Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, President of the Council\r\nthis month, for his excellent introduction of the report.\r\nThe annual report reflects the extensive activities of\r\nthe Security Council in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. During the past decade, we have seen\r\nthe world community increasingly turn to the United\r\nNations for solutions. Norway welcomes this\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\ndevelopment. Collective international security rests on the\r\nMember States’ commitment to multilateral cooperation and\r\non their respect for the primary responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council for the prevention of conflicts and the\r\npreservation of peace.\r\nThe General Assembly, in turn, has a legitimate\r\ninterest in being fully informed of the activities of the\r\nCouncil. The annual report must be as informative as\r\npossible. Norway appreciates the efforts to make the report\r\never more user-friendly and useful to the membership at\r\nlarge. We will encourage the Council to continue pursuing\r\nthese efforts.\r\nThe division of labour between the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council that is established in the Charter\r\nmust be respected. Nothing must be done that might reduce\r\nthe Council’s ability to efficiently carry out its primary\r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. At the same time, it is clear that questions of\r\npeace and security are closely connected to issues that are\r\nthe responsibility of the General Assembly. The\r\nSecretary-General has pointedly underlined the interlinkages\r\nbetween United Nations peace and development efforts, as\r\nwell as the need for coordination between various United\r\nNations bodies.\r\nThe General Assembly is responsible for vital areas\r\nsuch as poverty reduction, development assistance,\r\npeace-building, human rights and the environment. These\r\nare crucial to understanding and tackling the root causes of\r\nconflicts. Norway therefore stresses the need for a\r\ncomprehensive approach, entailing close cooperation\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nNorway has consistently underlined the importance of\r\nimproving transparency and openness in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. Progress has indeed been achieved over\r\nthe past few years. We welcome the fact that both regular\r\nand informal practices for sharing information with\r\nnon-members have been established. Norway appreciates\r\nthe practice of holding open orientation debates on\r\nimportant issues on the Council’s agenda. Such debates\r\nshould ensure that the views of the United Nations\r\nmembership at large are taken into account in the Council’s\r\nown deliberations.\r\nNorway would like to reiterate its support for the idea\r\nthat the Council should consider organizing meetings which\r\nare largely informative — such as briefings by the\r\nSecretariat or Special Representatives of the\r\nSecretary-General — as open meetings rather than\r\nconsultations of the whole. This would, of course, not\r\npreclude the possibility that the Council after such\r\nbriefings, would conduct closed consultations on the issue\r\nat hand.\r\nTransparency and openness are particularly important\r\nwhen it comes to peacekeeping operations, which involve\r\nthe participation of forces and personnel from a large\r\nnumber of countries beyond the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. All troop-contributing nations, including\r\nthose participating with civilian personnel in\r\nmultifunctional operations, have a legitimate interest and\r\nneed to be consulted when such operations are discussed.\r\nIn advance of considering mandates for peacekeeping\r\noperations, all potential contributors should be given the\r\nopportunity to present their views. Norway appreciates the\r\nmechanisms that have been established for this purpose.\r\nIt is the responsibility of all Council members and\r\ntroop-contributors to make full use of such mechanisms.\r\nRegional and subregional organizations have in\r\nrecent years become ever more important instruments in\r\nUnited Nations efforts to promote international peace and\r\nsecurity. In the Balkans, the United Nations is working\r\ntogether with organizations such as the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union and\r\nothers to restore peace and stability. As\r\nChairman-in-Office of the OSCE this year, Norway has\r\npursued the building of closer relations with the United\r\nNations system, and closer interaction between various\r\norganizations involved in peacekeeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building in the OSCE area.\r\nIn Africa, the Organization of African Unity and\r\nsubregional bodies such as the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community, the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States, and others play a crucial role as\r\ncooperation partners, complementing United Nations\r\nefforts for peace and development. Norway is proud to be\r\nworking closely with these organizations and national\r\nGovernments for conflict management and development\r\ncooperation in Africa. It is vital that the Security Council\r\nremain fully engaged in the resolution of conflicts on the\r\nAfrican continent, thus giving impetus to the progress\r\nwitnessed in several areas.\r\nThe Security Council remains at the centre of the\r\ninternational community’s search for lasting peace and\r\nsecurity for the world’s nations. This it how it should be.\r\nAs we enter a new century, it is of vital importance to all\r\nMembers of the United Nations that the authority of the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nCouncil remain strong and undiminished. The Security\r\nCouncil can, of course, rely on Norway’s full commitment\r\nand support.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nAllow me to join previous speakers in expressing\r\nappreciation to Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation and President of\r\nthe Security Council for the month of October 1999, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the opportunity for general\r\nmembership of the United Nations to discuss and review\r\nthe work of the Security Council. As the organ of the\r\nUnited Nations with primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, a\r\nresponsibility conferred upon it by the general membership\r\nof the United Nations, the Security Council plays a key role\r\nwhich directly affects the interests of all Member States.\r\nThe General Assembly is now considering the report\r\nof the Council not only in accordance with Article 15,\r\nparagraph 1, and Article 24, paragraph 3 of the Charter, as\r\nunderlined in the introduction to the Security Council\r\nreport, but also in the light of Article 24, paragraph 1 of the\r\nCharter. That paragraph determines that the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security is not an inherent right\r\nof the Council but a responsibility conferred upon it by the\r\ngeneral membership; and it states that the general\r\nmembership agreed, in the atmosphere prevailing 54 years\r\nago, that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility,\r\nthe Security Council acts on their behalf.\r\nTherefore, as a member of the General Assembly, we\r\nattach considerable importance to this agenda item, for each\r\nand every Member of the United Nations wishes to know\r\nnot only what the Security Council is doing on its behalf\r\nbut also why and how the Council is doing it.\r\nUnfortunately, the 476-page report contained in document\r\nA/54/2 covering the period from 16 June 1998 to 15 June\r\n1999, tells us only what the Security Council has done.\r\nThere is very little, if any, analysis or treatment of lessons\r\nlearned in the report despite repeated calls by the general\r\nmembership, which wishes only to be better informed.\r\nThe report continues to be largely a compilation of\r\ndocuments. It needs to contain information on informal\r\nconsultations of the whole, where most important decisions\r\nare\r\nmade. It should include not only the dates and subjects of\r\neach informal consultation but also a brief account of\r\ndiscussions.\r\nInformal consultations taking place among the\r\nmembers of the Council on issues crucial to global peace\r\nand security, sometimes have a very direct and\r\nsubstantive impact on the vital interests of other States.\r\nThese consultations normally constitute the foundation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and statements, with very\r\nlittle input from the wider membership. Of course, we\r\nrecognize the need for the promptness, effectiveness and,\r\nat times, confidentiality of Security Council\r\ndecision-making. However, these considerations do not\r\njustify a very narrow interpretation of Article 31 of the\r\nCharter by which interested Member States are excluded\r\nfrom contributing to the decision-making process of the\r\nCouncil or, even worse, are denied access to timely and\r\nmeaningful information concerning Security Council\r\ndecisions, their formulation and the implementation\r\nprocesses.\r\nThis is not to negate the fact that over the past few\r\nyears, the Council has adopted a number of initiatives to\r\nmake its working methods and its report more transparent\r\nand informative. We welcome and encourage those\r\nefforts, although we do not consider them sufficient.\r\nWe are happy to see that most monthly assessments\r\nof the work of the Security Council by the rotating\r\nPresidents of the Council are included in the report. These\r\nassessments complement the report in a very useful\r\nmanner. We hope that all monthly presidential\r\nassessments continue to evolve and rely less on\r\ndescription and more on conceptual and analytical\r\nassessment of the work of the Security Council.\r\nThe holding of an informal briefing by the\r\npresidency of the Council for States not members of the\r\nCouncil at the end of each informal meeting is a\r\ncommendable measure. We believe that this positive step\r\nmay be strengthened and become more useful if it is\r\ngiven some structure and uniformity. Currently, there\r\nseems to be a vicious cycle in place. The low turnout by\r\nrepresentatives of Member States works as a disincentive\r\nfor the Security Council President to be forthcoming in\r\nthe briefing, but, on the other hand, representatives of\r\nMember States lose interest when the Security Council\r\nPresident or his representative is not forthcoming and\r\nprovides little information. My delegation wishes to\r\nreiterate its suggestion, presented in the debates on this\r\nissue in the last two years, that the informal briefings by\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nthe Presidents of the Security Council be issued in the form\r\nof a press release on the same day or the day after and that\r\na cross- reference to them be made in the annual report of\r\nthe Council.\r\nTwo years ago, on 29 October 1997, when considering\r\nthis item in the General assembly, my delegation raised a\r\npoint concerning the coverage accorded to the work of the\r\nMilitary Staff Committee. I wish to note that in this year’s\r\nreport, 26 lines are devoted to the work of the Military\r\nStaff Committee which, compared to the reports of the last\r\ntwo years, shows an increase of about 600 per cent. We\r\nconsider this a good first step in the right direction.\r\nThe Security Council faced a considerable degree of\r\nupheaval last year. The human tragedy in Kosovo presented\r\na test to the Security Council in respect of our changing\r\nworld. It may not be far-fetched to suggest that even the\r\npermanent members of the Council are not too happy with\r\nthe performance of the Council, let alone the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations, which, by and large,\r\nfeels that the Security Council failed to perform its\r\nresponsibility under Chapter VII of the Charter and instead\r\nforfeited that responsibility to a regional military alliance.\r\nThis should have been a wake-up call for all of us: if the\r\nSecurity Council is not brought up to date and\r\ndemocratized, then the concept of collective security\r\ncontained in the Charter is bound to be compromised over\r\nand over again in the future, and the Security Council will\r\nthus be incapable of carrying out the responsibility that the\r\nStates Members initially conferred upon it.\r\nThe crux of the problem lies in the anachronistic and\r\nundemocratic practice of the veto. In our view, the\r\nexperience of the Security Council last year — particularly\r\nin the case of Kosovo, because of its fundamental impact\r\non the authority and credibility of the Council — warrants\r\na special report by the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly under Article 15 of the Charter. Such a report\r\nshould review the problems with which the Council was\r\nfaced, the deadlock and the reasons which gave rise to it,\r\nand how the Council anticipates resolving a similar\r\nsituation in the future. The position of my delegation on the\r\nissue of the veto has been spelled out in the position of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, which is under consideration in\r\nthe ad hoc committee which deals with the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nAnother important issue which is related to the\r\nexperience of the Council in Kosovo and enjoys\r\nprominence in the statement of the Secretary-General is the\r\nquestion of humanitarian intervention. It is a truism that the\r\ninternational community cannot and must not remain\r\naloof from bloodshed and massive violations of human\r\nrights when they occur within the borders of a State.\r\nHowever, since the sovereignty of States continues to\r\nconstitute the very cornerstone of law-based international\r\nrelations, care must be taken that the concept of\r\nhumanitarian intervention is not deliberated in an\r\natmosphere which cannot accommodate a truly\r\ndeliberative process and in which all States cannot\r\nadequately contribute to its refinement.\r\nMr. Singhvi (India): Permit me and my delegation\r\nto express our appreciation to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for his introduction of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council. We would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali,\r\nTunisia and Ukraine on their election to the Security\r\nCouncil. Elected by the General Assembly on the basis of\r\ncriteria laid down in Article 23 of the Charter, the non-\r\npermanent members help make the Security Council a\r\nlittle more representative and the system, with all its\r\nshortcomings, a little less imperfect.\r\nThe Charter makes it amply clear that the Security\r\nCouncil is one of the principal organs of the United\r\nNations and that it is entrusted with the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace and security\r\non behalf of all the Members of the United Nations. That\r\nis why Article 24, paragraph 3, and Article 15 of the\r\nCharter require the Security Council to submit, and the\r\nGeneral Assembly to receive and consider, annual and\r\nspecial reports. The submission of the Security Council\u0027s\r\nannual report to the General Assembly for its\r\nconsideration establishes the constitutional nexus of the\r\naccountability of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly, though, for obvious reasons, the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security is conferred upon the Security Council by the\r\nCharter, which gives pride of place to its membership.\r\nThe conferment of that primary responsibility has to\r\nbe seen in the context of the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil, the election of all the non-permanent members\r\nby the General Assembly, the provision of the Charter\r\nthat the Security Council acts on behalf of all Members\r\nand the crucial caveat of accountability in the form of\r\nsubmission of reports to and consideration by the General\r\nAssembly. These reports are like the hyphen that joins\r\nand the buckle that binds the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. An analysis of the organic instrument\r\nof the United Nations shows that the primary and\r\npenultimate responsibility of the Security Council is\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nlinked to the consideration of its report by the General\r\nAssembly. Therefore, we would urge the Security Council,\r\nin the discharge of that primary responsibility, to confine\r\nitself strictly to the mandate embodied in the Charter, to be\r\nresponsive to the comments and discussions in the General\r\nAssembly and to be procedurally transparent. The faithful\r\nobservance of those norms alone can secure and reinforce\r\na healthy constitutional relationship between the two\r\nprincipal organs, namely, the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe General Assembly encapsulated those norms in its\r\nresolution 51/193 of 1996, which was adopted with a view\r\nto improving the reporting procedures of the Security\r\nCouncil. In that resolution, the General Assembly called\r\nupon the Security Council to include, inter alia, information\r\non the consultations of the whole undertaken prior to action\r\nor deliberation by the Security Council on issues within its\r\nmandate and the process leading to such action; to highlight\r\nthe extent to which resolutions of the General Assembly on\r\nissues falling within the scope of the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council had been taken into account by the\r\nCouncil in its decision-making; and to strengthen further the\r\nsection of the report on the steps taken by the Council to\r\nimprove its working methods.\r\nThough some welcome changes have been introduced,\r\nthe Council\u0027s report now under discussion has not fully\r\nfollowed the letter and the spirit of resolution 51/193 of\r\n1996. As a result, the General Assembly, which is called\r\nupon by the Charter to consider the report, is placed at a\r\nserious disadvantage. The consideration of the report by the\r\nGeneral Assembly is not an empty ritual, and that is why\r\nwe reiterate the rationale and the compelling need for\r\nfurther improvements in the reporting procedures.\r\nThe problem of an inadequate and unsatisfactory\r\nreporting system is aggravated by the Security Council\u0027s\r\nresorting to the system of meeting behind closed doors, not\r\nas a rare or occasional exception but more or less as a rule.\r\nA closed meeting in extraordinary circumstances might\r\nhave some justification, but when it takes the form and\r\nfrequency of an addictive habit, it violates the principle of\r\ntransparency and openness, which is the leitmotif of our\r\nera. The Council\u0027s rules of procedure do not countenance\r\nthe practice. Rule 48 provides that the Security Council\r\nshall meet in public unless it decides otherwise. The plain\r\nimplication of the rule is that ordinarily the Security\r\nCouncil shall meet in public unless it decides otherwise for\r\ngood and compelling reasons. Most of the time there are no\r\nsuch compelling reasons, and yet frequent and persistent\r\ndepartures from the norm of meeting in public have\r\nbecome quite routine.\r\nThe peoples of the world, in whose name the\r\nCharter was proclaimed, have a right to know. Members\r\nof the United Nations, big and small, have a right to\r\nknow. It follows that we need a great deal more sunshine,\r\na new standard and quality of candour and a new sense of\r\naccountability to encompass and legitimize power and\r\nresponsibility. Deliberating behind closed doors and\r\nannouncing the formal conclusions to the world at large\r\nis no longer an acceptable procedure for the open society\r\ntowards which the world is moving.\r\nThis issue has been raised during the discussions in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group of the General Assembly\r\non the restructuring of the Security Council and in\r\nprevious deliberations on the report of the Security\r\nCouncil. Both non-members of the Council and the non-\r\npermanent members of the Council have in the past\r\ncomplained of a lack of transparency in the Council\u0027s\r\nwork. I recall from the record of last year\u0027s deliberations\r\nthat the need to enhance transparency was stressed and\r\nconceded by representative after representative. It was\r\nagreed that transparency applied not only to the way in\r\nwhich the Council carries out its work, but also to the\r\nway in which that work is reported and recorded; and that\r\nthe imbalance between open meetings of the Council and\r\nthe far more frequent use of the informal consultations of\r\nthe whole had to be redressed. The issue has long been\r\ndebated, but no real progress is in sight in spite of the\r\nchorus of consensus that once again characterizes the\r\ndebate this year.\r\nI might add that the principle of the need for\r\ntransparency applies not only to the Council\u0027s\r\ndeliberations but also to the work of its subsidiary bodies,\r\nin order to avoid the kind of divisive debate witnessed\r\nlast year over the functioning of the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission on Iraq.\r\nBeyond the flaws in the reporting procedures and in\r\nthe meetings behind closed doors, there is a deeper\r\nsubterranean fault line, a malady which points to the loss\r\nof moral vision and the democratic ethos of representation\r\nin the Security Council. Many a problem confronts us\r\ntoday because of the way the Security Council is\r\nstructured. The structure and composition of the Security\r\nCouncil are demonstrably out of touch with the ground\r\nrealities and no longer meet the aspirations and\r\nexpectations of the membership and of the international\r\ncommunity. The solution lies in reforming and\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nrestructuring the Council comprehensively. The inclusion of\r\ndeveloping countries in the permanent membership would\r\nmake the Council more representative, relevant and vibrant.\r\nIt would also make it more effective by bringing to the\r\nCouncil\u0027s actions the support of a much broader spectrum\r\nof the international community. We will make our detailed\r\ncomments on this issue during discussions on the agenda\r\nitem entitled “Question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters”. Suffice it to say that the restructuring of\r\nthe Security Council is a moral imperative and a practical\r\nnecessity. We are dismayed to find that there is pointless\r\ndelay in translating the basic ideas of restructuring into a\r\nreality. The danger is that the delay in restructuring may\r\nmake the system less relevant, less effectual and somewhat\r\nmoribund. That is why restructuring has an urgency of its\r\nown.\r\nThe Security Council has rightly expressed grave\r\nconcern with regard to the impact of terrorism on\r\ninternational peace and security. Happily, the resolution\r\nadopted by the Security Council yesterday shows that\r\nconcern as the first step and as a potential spearhead of\r\npurposeful action. We congratulate the Security Council for\r\nits resolve to wage a common fight against terrorism\r\neverywhere. We agree with the consensus view of the\r\nSecurity Council in yesterday’s meeting that we must not\r\nbe dissuaded by phony arguments about just causes and\r\nclaims about the supposedly political character of acts of\r\nterrorism. Let us hope that we will now move in the\r\ndirection of a global regime to effectively outlaw terrorism,\r\nwhatever its pretensions and excuses may be.\r\nThe spectre of terrorism today haunts and threatens\r\ncivilization itself. It imperils our common future. Organized\r\nterrorism as an instrument of policy by certain States and\r\nterrorism perpetrated by stray individuals and groups pose\r\na clear and present danger to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Terrorists are financed, funded, trained,\r\nencouraged, assisted and used by the Governments which\r\nnurture terrorist groups and individuals and give them their\r\nprotection, patronage under cloak-and-dagger tactics and\r\nsafe haven. Such state-sponsored terrorism has absolutely\r\nno place in contemporary international relations. There is\r\noften only a thin line between the troops of the States\r\nsponsoring terrorism and terrorist intruders, infiltrators,\r\nsaboteurs and mercenaries, who are used unscrupulously.\r\nThe purpose of such state-sponsored terrorism is to\r\ndestabilize other countries and Governments, in wanton\r\nviolation of the comity and conventions of international law\r\non friendly relations between sovereign nations. It\r\nendangers international peace and security.\r\nThe Security Council must demonstrate the political\r\nwill to address and combat this problem. Towards that\r\nend the international community must now prepare a\r\nglobal convention and a global blueprint to fight and\r\ndestroy terrorism, to facilitate extradition and to prevent\r\nand punish terrorism everywhere.\r\nAfghanistan remains a source of the deepest anxiety\r\nfor peace and security in the world. Our sympathies are\r\nwith the people of Afghanistan, who are in the throes of\r\na tragic conflict, confrontation and crisis. We do not have\r\nto go far in seeking the causes of that tragedy. In that\r\nclimate of intense hostility and pervasive distrust, the\r\nworld community has a vital role to play. We welcome\r\nthe Council’s recent action on Afghanistan, which needs\r\nto be followed up regularly, persistently and with\r\ndetermination. The Security Council has repeatedly\r\nexpressed grave concern at events in Afghanistan and\r\nstressed the need for a peaceful political settlement.\r\nIgnoring the Council’s advice and edicts, however, the\r\nTaliban launched yet another offensive earlier this year,\r\nin July. The Council, by adopting resolution 1267 (1999)\r\nlast week, has given another chance to the Taliban to end\r\nits support for international terrorism. We hope and pray\r\nthat they will heed the voice of the world community and\r\nthat the misery and suffering of the people of Afghanistan\r\nwill be alleviated. Unfortunately, our hopes are a hostage\r\nto despair. As a neighbour, India views the situation in\r\nAfghanistan with grave concern. We hope that the\r\nSecurity Council will give the problem of Afghanistan the\r\npriority attention it deserves.\r\nWhile regional organizations have a role in\r\npeacekeeping in accordance with the Charter, the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security lies with the Security Council. This role of\r\nthe Security Council has been eroded, abridged and\r\nsubverted by the developments of the past few years. This\r\nis a disturbing trend and raises many intractable\r\nquestions. In some cases, regional organizations may not\r\nhave the resources, or the mandate, or the truly\r\ninternational outlook and perspective to maintain peace\r\nand security. Delegating or abdicating the Council’s\r\nresponsibility for peacekeeping in such cases would\r\nsimply create a chaotic void. Even in cases where\r\nregional organizations have the military capacity, they\r\nlack the universal character of the United Nations and\r\nmay reflect only regional compulsions or narrow and\r\nlimited approaches. Their actions therefore would appear\r\nto be partisan, unless they have a mandate derived\r\ndirectly from the Security Council and function under its\r\numbrella.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nThe Secretary-General has aptly pointed out, in his\r\nannual report on the work of the Organization, that\r\n“if the primacy of the Security Council with respect to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security is\r\nrejected, the very foundations of international law as\r\nrepresented by the Charter will be brought into\r\nquestion.” (A/54/1, para. 69)\r\nHe added:\r\n“No other universally accepted legal basis for\r\nconstraining wanton acts of violence exists.” (ibid.)\r\nWe feel that the Security Council’s role in authorizing and\r\nundertaking peacekeeping operations, when required, must\r\nbe strengthened, and the universally accepted legal basis for\r\nconstraining wanton acts of violence be repaired and\r\nreinstated. We cannot view with equanimity the relegation\r\nof the Charter and the relegation of the Security Council to\r\nthe role of a passive spectator and its real role being\r\npre-empted.\r\nThe Council’s actions need greater clarity, equity and\r\nsense of purpose. It has to be seen to act fairly, consistently\r\nand decisively. For instance, the role of the Council in\r\nrunning the oil-for-food programme for Iraq, under which\r\nthe Council members decide which contracts to approve and\r\nwhich to put on hold, has led to a situation where hundreds\r\nof contracts worth over $450 million have been put on\r\nhold, without any effective or independent avenue to\r\nimprove the situation.\r\nWe welcome the Security Council debate on Africa,\r\nin which India participated. In the past, early warnings were\r\nnot heeded. Often enough, the Security Council failed to\r\nrespond in time to African crises or to sustain its\r\ncommitments to Africa. We note that some new initiatives\r\nare afoot. We would support and participate in the\r\noperation in Sierra Leone and in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo. There is no gainsaying that Africa’s problems\r\ndemand a more comprehensive solution with inputs and\r\ncontributions from other organs of the United Nations. This\r\nhas been acknowledged by Security Council resolution 1170\r\n(1998), which expressed the hope that the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and other\r\nrelevant bodies of the United Nations and international\r\nfinancial institutions would consider the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport and take appropriate action. Peace and security in\r\nAfrica will depend on an all-out preventive effort,\r\nconstructive multilateral diplomacy and a strong\r\ndevelopmental perspective.\r\nIndia is proud to have been in the forefront of troop-\r\ncontributing countries in most of the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping efforts. While we appreciate the increased\r\nand regular interaction between the Council and the troop-\r\ncontributing countries, we believe that the quality of that\r\ninteraction could be improved. There should be fuller\r\nconsultation with the major troop-contributing countries,\r\nespecially before any change in the mandate of an\r\noperation.\r\nThe Security Council has the responsibility to\r\nredress the economic problems of third countries affected\r\nby the sanctions it has mandated. Though this matter has\r\nbeen under discussion in the Sixth Committee for a\r\nnumber of years, no tangible progress has been achieved.\r\nWe hope that the Council will display a strong problem-\r\nsolving approach and greater political will to give effect\r\nto Article 50 of the Charter. The mandate of Article 50 is\r\nthat States affected by preventive or enforcement\r\nmeasures taken against another State by the Security\r\nCouncil have a right to consult the Council, which then\r\nhas the obligation to find a fair solution to the problem.\r\nThere is a strange paradox. While attempts are being\r\nmade by some to ease the Security Council out of its role\r\nin peacekeeping, which is its responsibility under the\r\nCharter, it shows a tendency to assume a proactive, and\r\noccasionally not-so-objective, role for itself in a variety of\r\nother areas like human rights, disarmament or\r\ninternational humanitarian law. This blurring of the\r\ndistinction between the roles of different organs or bodies\r\ncan create a counterproductive confusion and conflicts of\r\njurisdiction, which are best avoided.\r\nThe United Nations enshrines a vision which\r\ndelineates humanity\u0027s tryst with its new destiny. We need\r\nto strengthen that vision. We need to recast and\r\nreconstruct United Nations structures and procedural\r\nmodalities to translate that vision into a living reality and\r\nto give the United Nations a new momentum on the\r\nthreshold of the twenty-first century. We need to\r\nremember that peace is a many-splendoured concept, as\r\nexplained by the sages and seers of ancient India who\r\nproclaimed that humankind is one family, that the quest\r\nfor peace in the inner and outer space of human\r\nconsciousness and endeavour ranges from the social,\r\nscientific, economic, religious, political and ecological to\r\nthe ethical and the spiritual. Freedom, peace and justice,\r\nalthough intertwined, have a security dimension, and that\r\nsecurity dimension has been entrusted to the Security\r\nCouncil so that succeeding generations may be saved\r\nfrom the scourge of war, violence and bloodshed. The\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nSecurity Council will, I am sure, be an instrument for\r\nfulfilling our sanguine hope and our resonant resolve in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nWe expect the Council to give due consideration to the\r\nconstructive comments offered in this Assembly today and\r\nreflect them in its working, in its approach to problems, in\r\nits restructuring and in its next report. In the success of the\r\nSecurity Council lies the possibility of the success of the\r\ngreat human experiment in, and enterprise of, togetherness\r\nthat is the United Nations.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): With\r\nregard to the working methods of the Security Council, in\r\nparticular the issues of transparency, Argentina has the\r\nhonour of working in close cooperation with the New\r\nZealand delegation, which has indicated to me that it\r\nendorses what I am about to say.\r\nAmbassador Sergey Lavrov of the Russian Federation\r\nintroduced to the General Assembly the report (A/54/2) of\r\nthe Security Council. We thank him for the statement he\r\nmade in his capacity as President of the Security Council.\r\nOur commitment to increased transparency in the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council is well known.\r\nOn that matter I need only reiterate that we make ourselves\r\navailable to all those Member States that are not members\r\nof the Security Council in order to continue to make\r\nprogress towards that goal, which is essential for the\r\nOrganization\u0027s reform process.\r\nThe latest developments in Security Council procedure\r\nhave placed the presidency in a key position. The\r\npresidency is responsible for providing daily briefings to the\r\nother Members of the United Nations and the media. It is\r\nalso responsible for the presentation and content of the\r\nmonthly assessments which appear in the addendum to the\r\nreport. It is also the President of the Security Council who\r\nis mandated to meet with the representatives of the other\r\nMembers of the United Nations. This delegation of\r\nresponsibilities to the presidency provides additional\r\nguarantees of transparency because the person responsible\r\nfor providing information is identified.\r\nOn 23 September last, after meeting with the\r\nSecretary-General, the five permanent members issued a\r\nstatement in which they affirmed that any attempt to curtail\r\ntheir right of veto would not be conducive to the process of\r\nreforming the Security Council. However, it must now be\r\naccepted that the exercise of the veto — as understood by\r\nthe permanent members — is incompatible with the will of\r\nthe vast majority of Member States. If that is not truly\r\nunderstood, the efforts to reform the working methods of\r\nthe Council will not have a bright future.\r\nThe report shows that in the period under review\r\nmore than 50 meetings of troop-contributing countries\r\ntook place. We are pleased to note the good results of the\r\ninitiative to institutionalize those meetings, a process led\r\nsince 1994 by, among others, the delegations of New\r\nZealand and Argentina. We hope that this practice, as set\r\nout in the presidential statements of 3 May and 4\r\nNovember 1994 and 28 March 1996, will continue to\r\nbenefit the countries that contribute personnel in\r\nfulfilment of the mandates of the Security Council. We do\r\nnot share the objections, based on the alleged poor\r\nattendance. The goal of those meetings was, and still is,\r\nto give the troop-contributing countries a forum to express\r\ntheir concerns. We feel the same way about the criticism\r\nof the briefing meetings for non-members of the Security\r\nCouncil, based on the same arguments.\r\nA reading of the first paragraphs of the report\r\nconfirms that over two thirds of the Council\u0027s work takes\r\nplace in the so-called informal consultations, to which\r\naccess is still denied to non-members. However, there is\r\nno reason why such countries should be permanently\r\ndenied the right to participate in the informal\r\nconsultations on the basis of Articles 31 and 32 of the\r\nCharter. The right to participate of countries whose\r\ninterests are affected by the discussion of an issue brought\r\nto the attention of the Security Council was debated at\r\nlength this year in the Working Group on documentation\r\nand procedure. Its draft report still has not been adopted\r\nby the Security Council, because some members do not\r\nagree that it should at least be made clear that there was\r\nno agreement regarding the participation in informal\r\nconsultations of non-members and representatives of\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nWe have emphasized on several occasions that\r\nArgentina acknowledges the usefulness of such\r\nconsultations. We think that they are important and\r\nfrequent enough to warrant the establishment of rules for\r\ntheir proceedings in order to guarantee their proper\r\nfunctioning.\r\nClosed formal meetings, such as the one to be held\r\nnext week to hear Mr. Jacques Klein, Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, can be a valid mechanism for the\r\nparticipation of countries that are not members of the\r\nCouncil. Another valid mechanism is the formal open\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nmeeting, with records and a media presence, such as that in\r\nwhich we heard President Chiluba of Zambia and he\r\nlistened to us.\r\nWe reiterate our reluctance to utilize other types of\r\nformulas for the Security Council to communicate with\r\nGovernment representatives. As Ambassador Arria of\r\nVenezuela and several delegations, including our own, have\r\nexplained on a number of occasions, the “Arria formula” is\r\nnot the proper one for that purpose. That formula is an\r\ninnovative and useful mechanism that allows the Council to\r\nestablish truly informal and off-the-record contacts with\r\nindividuals and organizations whose activities might be\r\nrelevant to the issues on the agenda. The fact that it has\r\nbeen used to hear Foreign Ministers or other Ministers of\r\nMember States does not reflect either the intent or the spirit\r\nof the formula developed by Ambassador Arria, and it\r\nimplies a failure by the Council to devise mechanisms for\r\ndialogue within the limits of its rules of procedure.\r\nMeetings open to other Member countries are another\r\nforum that can be used for briefings by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, his representatives, and other high Secretariat\r\nofficials. We are moving gradually towards the point where\r\nsuch oral briefings will no longer be given in informal\r\nconsultations to which non-members of the Council lack\r\naccess.\r\nThe influence of the General Assembly has yielded\r\nresults. Let us remember that the improvements made to the\r\nreport were adopted by the Council after the Assembly had\r\nadopted its resolution 51/193. Step by step, we will succeed\r\nin improving the working methods of the Security Council\r\nand in bringing them into line with democratic principles.\r\nWe are optimistic, because intransigence on these matters\r\nseems less and less viable.\r\nWe pay tribute to United Nations staff members killed\r\nor wounded as they carried out activities entrusted to them\r\nby the Security Council. We believe that the Security\r\nCouncil must be mindful of these tragedies and consider\r\nappropriate measures to prevent such events in the future.\r\nThe comments the Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Louise\r\nFréchette, made to the General Assembly on 14 October\r\nwere eloquent and require a response.\r\nIn conclusion, we congratulate the delegations of\r\nBangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and Ukraine on their\r\nelection to membership of the Security Council for the next\r\nbiennium, and we welcome them to the Council.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): I wish to join previous\r\nspeakers in thanking the Permanent Representative of the\r\nRussian Federation, President of the Security Council for\r\nthe month of October 1999, for introducing the report of\r\nthe Security Council. The entire membership of this\r\nOrganization attaches great importance to the work of the\r\nSecurity Council, and the annual report is a useful\r\nmechanism to keep the wider membership informed of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s activities and decisions. The Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations provides in its Article 15 that the General\r\nAssembly shall receive and consider annual and special\r\nreports from the Council. This provision constitutes the\r\nmost important link between the Assembly, which is the\r\nonly organ consisting of all members, and the Security\r\nCouncil, which acts on our behalf.\r\nWhile both principal organs are vested with different\r\nand specific mandates, each in its own way serves the\r\ninterest of the entire membership. As a useful tool to keep\r\nnon-members informed of the Council\u0027s work, the report\r\nmust reflect the objective circumstances surrounding the\r\nconsideration of various issues on the agenda of the\r\nCouncil. We are therefore encouraged by the progressive\r\nimprovements over the last few years in the Council\u0027s\r\nreports, including the present one.\r\nTurning to the report before us, we are pleased to\r\nnote a new appendix to the report, containing reports of\r\nthe sanctions committees. This wider coverage of the\r\nwork of the subsidiary organs of the Council is a\r\nwelcome step. We are equally pleased to observe the\r\ncontinued inclusion of the monthly assessments prepared\r\nby former Presidents of the Security Council. We\r\ncontinue to hold the view that these assessments\r\ncontribute to our better understanding of the\r\nconsiderations which were taken into account in adopting\r\nimportant resolutions concerning many issues on the\r\nCouncil\u0027s agenda. Although these assessments are\r\nvoluntary in nature and do not necessarily represent the\r\nviews of the Security Council as a whole, they provide a\r\nuseful and valuable insight into the informal consultations\r\nwhere important decisions of the Council are generally\r\nconsidered and thus complement the report in an effective\r\nmanner. The inclusion in this year\u0027s report of statements\r\nto the press made by the President following consultations\r\nof the whole of the Council add to the value of these\r\nassessments. We subscribe to the view that these\r\nassessments should be compulsory. We urge Presidents of\r\nthe Council to maintain this positive practice in the\r\nmeantime.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nWhile we still hold the view that there remain some\r\naspects of the report that need to be improved, we consider\r\nthat the improvements that have been made thus far in the\r\nformat and content of the report are important steps towards\r\ngreater transparency in the work of the Council. Openness\r\nand transparency are particularly important for an organ\r\nsuch as the Security Council, which deals with vital issues\r\nof international peace and security. We strongly feel that it\r\nis the right of the international community to be adequately\r\ninformed, through all viable mechanisms, of what the\r\nCouncil is doing in its name.\r\nIn this respect, we would like to reiterate our view,\r\npresented at the last session of the General Assembly under\r\nthe same item, that the Security Council should submit\r\nspecial reports to the General Assembly on certain\r\nimportant issues. We were heartened when the Council\r\ndecided to consider and review ways to improve the\r\nCouncil\u0027s documentation and procedures, including the\r\nprovision of special reports as called for in Article 24,\r\nparagraph 3, of the Charter. We wish to encourage the\r\nCouncil to follow up that important decision with specific\r\nactions which will add to transparency in the work of the\r\nCouncil. We are of the view that the present efforts towards\r\ngreater transparency and openness must be pursued on a\r\nsustained basis. My delegation fully supports the\r\nmechanisms and practices that have been established to that\r\nend. We believe that these efforts will increase not only the\r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the Council but its\r\ncredibility as well.\r\nWhile considering the report of the Council, my\r\ndelegation wishes to make some remarks on a few aspects\r\nof the work of the Council. As indicated by the greater\r\nnumber of formal and informal meetings held and of\r\nresolutions adopted, the Council had a very heavy agenda\r\nand an eventful year. We are highly disturbed to have\r\nwitnessed developments in certain areas of the world that\r\ntested not only the effectiveness of the Council but also its\r\ncredibility. In these developments, the Council was\r\nmarginalized and was prevented from playing its proper\r\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIt was also with a sense of uneasiness that we observed a\r\nunique pattern of finding a solution to an unfolding crisis\r\nin the Balkans through the mechanism of a regional\r\norganization. While we are fully aware of the success\r\nstories of some regional organizations and of their\r\nincreasingly active role in the work of the Security Council\r\nin the past several years, especially in the realm of peace\r\nenforcement, the actions of regional organizations must, in\r\nour view, be clearly mandated and should not bypass the\r\nSecurity Council if the multilateral system for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security is to be\r\neffectively maintained. There should not be any erosion\r\nof the Council\u0027s primary responsibility. To do otherwise,\r\nhowever strong the justification may be, is not defensible\r\neither legally or politically.\r\nWe note with appreciation that the Council was\r\nengaged in debates on themes other than crisis situations,\r\nsuch as children and armed conflict and protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict, et cetera. Consideration of\r\nthese themes as part of the work of the Council is a\r\nhealthy trend that deserves our full support. We hope that\r\nthese thematic debates will enhance the capacity of the\r\nCouncil to deal with the complex causes of crises on its\r\nagenda. We are pleased to see that these debates have\r\nrecently become an important feature of the Council\u0027s\r\nagenda and that the Member States have actively\r\nparticipated in them.\r\nI wish particularly to refer to debate on threats to\r\npeace and security by international terrorist acts. Terrorist\r\nacts are generally indiscriminate in nature and,\r\naccordingly, endanger not only the lives of those\r\nparticularly targeted but also innocent lives. As such,\r\nthese cowardly acts have become an emerging source of\r\nthreats to peace and security. Therefore the adoption by\r\nthe Council of resolution 1189 (1998) is a right step. It is\r\nalso encouraging that by that resolution the Council\r\nshows that it is determined to eliminate international\r\nterrorism. We are convinced that only through cooperation\r\namong States can there be effective and practical\r\nmeasures to prevent acts of terrorism.\r\nWe indeed appreciate the value of thematic debates\r\nas they contribute to the work of the Council. However,\r\nthis does not necessarily mean that those debates should\r\nallow the Council to move into the area of issues or\r\nconcerns not envisaged for it in the Charter. In this regard\r\nthe provisions of the Charter are abundantly clear. Article\r\n24 confers on the Security Council primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of peace and security and states that\r\n“The Security Council shall act in accordance with the\r\nPurposes and Principles of the United Nations”. We hope\r\nthat in discharging its cardinal duties the Council will\r\nrefrain from stretching its mandate beyond what is\r\ndefined in the Charter and continue to focus primarily on\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nFurthermore, we feel that the measures adopted by\r\nthe Security Council, especially those entailing the use of\r\nforce or military elements, should conform to the\r\nprinciples of international law and take into account the\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nprinciple of respect for sovereignty. It is also vitally\r\nimportant that measures with military elements should not\r\nbe a convenient way of interfering in affairs that\r\nexclusively fall within the domestic jurisdiction of States.\r\nThe General Assembly has taken various steps to\r\nstrengthen its link with the Security Council. I recall, in\r\nparticular, Assembly resolutions 47/233, 48/264 and, last\r\nbut not least, 51/193. On the other hand, the Security\r\nCouncil has, in response, taken many worthwhile measures.\r\nAs a result, the process of interaction between the two\r\norgans with a view to enhancing the performance of the\r\nUnited Nations has gathered momentum, as attested by the\r\nimproved format and content of the Council\u0027s annual reports\r\nand their timely submission to the General Assembly. We\r\nconsider that it is important not to lose momentum. We\r\nhope that through these efforts of both organs, we will have\r\na Council which is more transparent, open and accountable\r\nto all Members of the United Nations, on whose behalf it\r\nacts.\r\nMr. Francese (Italy) (spoke in French): Mr. President,\r\nI am particularly happy to speak to the Assembly this\r\nevening while you are presiding.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFirst of all, allow me to congratulate the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation, Ambassador\r\nSergey Lavrov, this month\u0027s President of the Security\r\nCouncil, for his clear, precise and detailed presentation of\r\nthe Council\u0027s annual report to the General Assembly. I also\r\nwish to compliment the Secretariat and its staff on an\r\nexcellent job of preparing the document. Furthermore, my\r\ndelegation is deeply appreciative of the endeavours of the\r\nmembers of the Security Council, all of them in favour of\r\ninternational peace and security. But it is particularly fitting\r\ntoday to express the most sincere feelings of appreciation\r\nand best wishes to the newly elected members for the years\r\n2000 and 2001. Italy is sure that Bangladesh, Jamaica,\r\nMali, Tunisia and Ukraine will contribute new energy,\r\nincreased creativity and better representativity to the\r\nsupreme organ of the United Nations, an organ that draws\r\ngreat benefit from the frequent, regular rotation of its\r\nmembers.\r\nItaly has repeatedly underlined that the General\r\nAssembly\u0027s discussion of the Security Council\u0027s report is\r\nessential to assuring effective coordination and interaction\r\nbetween the Council and the Assembly, in accordance with\r\nthe provisions of Article 15 of the Charter. To achieve this,\r\nthe report should provide an analytical, thorough and\r\nrealistic picture of the work actually done by the Council.\r\nWhile much has been accomplished along these lines in\r\nrecent years, a great deal remains to be done.\r\nOn this same occasion last year, Italy praised\r\nchanges in the format of the report, for example the\r\ninclusion of a fifth part dedicated to the subsidiary organs\r\nof the Security Council such as the sanctions committees\r\nand the Tribunals on former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. I\r\nwould be remiss not to express again this year our\r\nappreciation for a fine set of documents, which has been,\r\nwe must acknowledge, improved by annexing the annual\r\nreports of the sanctions committees. It is encouraging to\r\nsee that the Council has made it almost a uniform practice\r\nto distribute a document on the work of the Council at the\r\nend of each presidency, with the noticeable exception of\r\nthe crucial month of May 1999. However, rather than a\r\ndescriptive list of decisions, statements and resolutions,\r\nwe would like the report to contain more of an in-depth\r\nanalysis and a real assessment of the issues falling within\r\nthe scope of the Council\u0027s activities.\r\nFor instance, already last year we proposed that the\r\nreport be improved by providing more detailed\r\ninformation on meetings with troop-contributing countries.\r\nIn sum, while the report deserves our praise as a useful\r\nreference tool, which is certainly valuable to the work of\r\nour missions, it is much harder to affirm that it provides\r\nthe General Assembly with an exhaustive instrument for\r\nassessing the work of the Security Council.\r\nFor such an assessment to be possible, the Assembly\r\nwould need not only copies of the Council\u0027s decisions and\r\nresolutions, but also indications of substance regarding the\r\nproceedings that led to their adoption. The report should\r\nsummarize the Council\u0027s debates on crisis areas, regional\r\ntensions, humanitarian emergencies and other subjects\r\ncrucial to international peace and security, including\r\nhuman security, as well as regional and global stability.\r\nWe should be provided not only with the text of the\r\nresolutions approved, but also with relevant information\r\non the decision-making process that led to their adoption\r\nor that might have prevented other resolutions from being\r\nadopted. Everyone knows what was done, but we do not\r\nalways know what was not done by the Security Council.\r\nWithout this kind of information, we have no way of\r\nknowing whether the Council has expressed its full\r\npotential or simply struggled to contain divisions within\r\nits midst.\r\nIn discussing the report, we cannot avoid turning our\r\nattention, once again, to the issue of transparency and the\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nworking methods of the Security Council. Article 24 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter affirms that members of the\r\nOrganization\r\n“confer on the Security Council primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, and agree that in carrying out its duties under\r\nthis responsibility the Security Council acts on their\r\nbehalf”.\r\nIn agreeing to the Charter and its provisions, Members\r\nStates did not abdicate their role in dealing with world\r\nsecurity. For reasons of expediency and urgency, they\r\nsimply delegated to the Council the primary task of\r\nascertaining emerging threats and of taking immediate\r\naction to curb them, always acting on behalf of the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nThus we believe that, as a general rule, the Security\r\nCouncil should convene in public formal session.\r\nFurthermore, briefings and reports by the Secretary-General\r\nand other high representatives of the Secretariat could in\r\nprinciple be delivered in meetings open to all Member\r\nStates. We commend the fact that there were more formal\r\nmeetings during the year under review than in the previous\r\n12 months. Yet measures are still needed to ensure that\r\nsuch meetings are not dedicated only to the ritual approval\r\nof documents or to debate on matters of importance but of\r\nless urgency. More than 170 countries are informed of\r\nCouncil discussions only after they have taken place, and\r\nthen obviously in an intermittent and incomplete way, via\r\nsecond-hand or third-hand news that travels from mission\r\nto mission.\r\nInternational peace and security is a common good\r\nthat is not the exclusive property of any one Member State\r\nor, for that matter, of those who sit in the Security Council.\r\nCouncil members, both permanent and non-permanent, must\r\nbe held accountable for the positions they take on the\r\nimportant issues mandated to them. That accountability\r\nwould be better provided by a more analytical and\r\ncomprehensive format for the report, which, among other\r\nthings, would allow Member States to undertake a real\r\nappraisal of the extent to which the Council’s\r\ndecision-making reflects both General Assembly and\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nThe report of the Security Council covers June 1998\r\nto June 1999, a period in time characterized by numerous\r\ncrises to which the international community felt it was its\r\nduty to respond. Allow me to state that — while all threats\r\nto international peace and security, wherever they emerge,\r\nmust, to the best of the Security Council’s ability, be\r\ntackled equitably — it is Africa and the various regional\r\ncrises in that continent that will, in the end, be the litmus\r\ntest of the effectiveness of the United Nations. It is our\r\nfirm conviction that, as regards Africa, the Security\r\nCouncil will have to increasingly deploy its political\r\nacumen and operational determination. The experience of\r\nthe past must guide us to a better future.\r\nIt has been noted in the past months that the events\r\nin Kosovo showed a lack of unity among Council\r\nmembers that prevented the United Nations from playing\r\na significant role in a major humanitarian crisis from its\r\noutset. As Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini stated in his\r\naddress at the opening of the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly:\r\n“stalemates and paralysis of intersecting vetoes must\r\nbe avoided by anchoring even the strongest States to\r\na system of rules [of behaviour] and principles\r\n[political if not legal]”. (A/54/PV.8)\r\nItaly remains deeply committed to a reform of the\r\nSecurity Council based on the experience of recent years,\r\nwhich has shown that the Council’s ability to tackle\r\ninternational crises promptly and effectively is\r\nintrinsically regulated by the veto or the mere threat of its\r\nuse.\r\nWe all recognize that to meet the new and manifold\r\nchallenges regarding its institutional responsibility our\r\nOrganization needs to adapt. In this context the reform of\r\nthe Security Council is a crucial element. The Council\r\nneeds to be made more representative, democratic and\r\ntransparent. All regional groups and their members should\r\nfeel that they are adequately mirrored in the composition\r\nof the Security Council and in its activities. The\r\nimportance\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 October 1999\r\nof each and every Member State being truly convinced that\r\nthe Council is readily accountable and effectively\r\nresponsive does not need to be underlined; this is main way\r\nof guaranteeing that the United Nations has the ways, the\r\nmeans and the political will to fulfil the lofty goal of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
