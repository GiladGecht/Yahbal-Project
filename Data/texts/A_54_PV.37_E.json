(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/54/2)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Jordán-Pando\r\n(Bolivia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): The\r\nUnited Nations is being tested as never before by the\r\nworld\u0027s demands for action on problems which we all share,\r\nor which arouse widespread international concern. In an era\r\nof massive change, the United Nations too must change or\r\nbe seen to fail.\r\nThe Security Council has to be part of that change;\r\nand this General Assembly debate on the annual report is\r\nan important opportunity to discuss that. The United\r\nKingdom vigorously supports, and has a significant national\r\nstake in, a Security Council which lives up to its full\r\nresponsibilities and achieves results in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. That is why the United\r\nKingdom is active in the debate on reform, so that the\r\nCouncil can again enjoy the full confidence of the United\r\nNations membership. This means, in our view, enlargement\r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories of\r\nmembership, with the allocation of new permanent seats\r\nreflecting the vital role of the non-industrial countries, as\r\nwell as the contribution of Germany and Japan to the work\r\nof the Organization. And it also means greater transparency\r\nand communication in the daily work of the Council.\r\nThis year, after a period in which the Council did\r\nnot consistently measure up to the Charter\u0027s expectations,\r\nthere is a renewed determination to bring its weight and\r\nauthority to bear. That includes a greater readiness to\r\nauthorize new peacekeeping operations. On issues such as\r\nSierra Leone, East Timor and Lockerbie, the United\r\nKingdom has been extremely active in forging a more\r\nactive and better targeted Security Council role. Even on\r\nthe most controversial issues — I have in mind Iraq and\r\nKosovo — where we had earlier judged that the Security\r\nCouncil had failed badly to generate a collective response,\r\nthe United Kingdom has worked hard, and continues to\r\nwork hard, to re-establish a central role for the Council.\r\nThe proof of success in such difficult areas will be\r\nin the final result: in the case of Kosovo, in the proper\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999); in the case of Iraq, in the adoption of a resolution\r\nwhich reconstitutes an active and productive United\r\nNations presence in Iraq in both the humanitarian and the\r\ndisarmament fields; and in the case of East Timer, in final\r\nindependence and a good relationship with Indonesia.\r\nImportant as those subjects are, I believe that the\r\ngreatest ongoing challenge to the Security Council is\r\npresented by the problems of Africa. On no other\r\ncontinent does conflict do such damage to political and\r\neconomic structures and to ordinary people. Africans\r\nrightly call out for more international action; and\r\nnon-Africans, above all in the developed world, must\r\nrespond. I understand the cries of double standards —\r\nthat we are prepared to act decisively in other continents\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nbut not in Africa. But that is not the real story, and, while\r\noutside action is necessary, outside action alone is not\r\nenough. Africa, because both political structures and\r\neconomic growth are often too weak, needs long-term\r\nassistance, not just short-term palliative action. The role of\r\nthe latter is reduced if the former is not also put in place.\r\nThe United Kingdom, for one, has shown by its\r\nactions, and not just by its rhetoric, that we are committed\r\nto bringing greater stability and prosperity to the continent.\r\nIf we are to address the long-term nature of African\r\nproblems, we shall need a special kind of cooperation\r\nbetween African and international leaders; a redefinition of\r\nthe real objectives of such cooperation; and deeper and\r\nmore frequent communication. Direct links between the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Security Council\r\nshould be part of that. In the Central African Republic and\r\nin Sierra Leone we are beginning at last to make progress.\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nand Angola now need our urgent attention. The lessons we\r\nlearn from these issues could then perhaps be applied to the\r\ndistressingly hard cases of Sudan and Somalia.\r\nIn this call for more attention to African issues I sense\r\na more general trend of international support for greater\r\nactivism by the United Nations, not least when\r\nhumanitarian catastrophes threaten. Kosovo, and more\r\nrecently East Timor, have raised important questions about\r\nhumanitarian action and its relation to the principles of\r\nnational sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs.\r\nThe British Foreign Secretary told the General Assembly\r\nlast month\r\n“that the first responsibility for reconciling\r\ninternal conflict rests with the State in which that\r\nconflict arises. But we also have a shared\r\nresponsibility to act when we are confronted with\r\ngenocide, mass displacement of peoples or major\r\nbreaches of humanitarian law”. (A/54/PV.5)\r\nAs British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a speech\r\nin Chicago in April this year, working out the conditions\r\nand identifying the circumstances when it is right in the\r\nmodern world to intervene is the most pressing problem in\r\nforeign policy today. We believe that that debate, which is\r\ncrucial to the Security Council\u0027s role in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, needs to be pursued as a\r\nmatter of urgency. But we must avoid a sterile or an\r\nideological confrontation. We are, after all, seeking to help\r\nordinary people, not to attack systems. Before creating new\r\nmachinery, we should widen and deepen our informal\r\ndiscussions. If we can build consensus — in the Security\r\nCouncil as well as elsewhere — around a pragmatic set\r\nof principles and conditions, it is more likely that the\r\nSecurity Council will be able to fulfil its responsibilities\r\nquickly and unanimously, without disturbing our respect\r\nfor each other’s values and cultures.\r\nFinally, a few words about the issue of transparency.\r\nThe United Kingdom strongly agrees on the need for the\r\nCouncil to carry out its responsibilities in a transparent\r\nmanner. This year’s report to the General Assembly is a\r\nfurther improvement: it now includes, for the first time,\r\nthe annual reports of the sanctions committees, as an\r\nappendix.\r\nBut more could be done to improve transparency.\r\nDuring the period under review, the Council held 121\r\nformal meetings, many of them to adopt resolutions\r\nwithout debate, and 239 consultations in the other room.\r\nInformal consultations continue to be necessary,\r\nparticularly for more complex issues or for detailed\r\nnegotiation. But the United Kingdom believes that more\r\nof the work done in informal consultations could and\r\nshould be done at public meetings of the Council. There\r\nis a considerable appetite among the membership for\r\nmore public discussion of substantive country-specific\r\nissues currently being dealt with by the Council. Greater\r\ntransparency in this area can be achieved, if we are\r\nsensible, without diminishing the effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil’s work. We hope to take this forward over the\r\ncoming year, including during the United Kingdom\r\npresidency in December 1999.\r\nA healthy and effective Security Council, achieving\r\nsolid results, is indispensable to a healthy and effective\r\nUnited Nations system. The Security Council must work\r\nas an integral part of that system, connecting with the\r\nwork of the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and receiving in return positive inputs\r\nform those and other bodies. The United Nations is more\r\nthan any nation, more than any council, more than any\r\nbloc. It is time we all agreed to release its real potential.\r\nThe United Kingdom will work hard for that.\r\nMr. Lee See-young (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation has carefully examined the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly covering the\r\nperiod from June 1998 to June 1999. My delegation\r\nappreciates the statement by Ambassador Sergey Lavrov,\r\nPresident of the Security Council for this month,\r\nintroducing the report.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nAs we take stock of the state of affairs in the Security\r\nCouncil over the reporting period, my delegation wishes to\r\npay tribute to the members of the Council and the\r\nSecretary-General for their around-the-clock, year-round\r\nhard work in the discharge of their responsibilities as the\r\nCouncil dealt with a number of crisis situations from\r\nBosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan to Rwanda, Congo and,\r\nnow, East Timor and Sierra Leone.\r\nWith this in mind, allow me to discuss some aspects\r\nof the Council’s activities to which we attach particular\r\nimportance.\r\nFirst, we cannot but admit that, in this world of\r\nunprecedentedly deepening interdependence, the Security\r\nCouncil over the past year had to face enormous challenges\r\nof tackling more than ever a much wider range of complex\r\nissues directly or indirectly related to international peace\r\nand security. One of the phenomena which reflected such\r\na trend in the Council’s work was that the Council\r\norganized more open discussions on a number of issues\r\naddressed as separate agenda items — namely, the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict; post-conflict\r\npeace-building; disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration of former combatants; small arms; and\r\nchildren and armed conflict. Just two days ago the Council\r\nheld a formal meeting on international terrorism at the\r\ninitiative of the Russian delegation.\r\nThe issues that have traditionally been considered\r\nunder the competence of the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council or other organs of the United\r\nNations now require the attention of the Security Council\r\nto address those aspects falling practically within the\r\npurview of the Council. In this connection, we believe that\r\nthe Council should make further efforts to build an\r\neffective partnership with the Assembly and other organs\r\nwithin the United Nations system in order to strengthen its\r\nrelevance in meeting complex and multifaceted challenges\r\nfacing the United Nations in a more comprehensive and\r\ncoordinated manner.\r\nIn a similar vein, I would like to echo the suggestions\r\nmade by my Egyptian colleague yesterday that, in\r\naccordance with Article 15 of the United Nations Charter,\r\nthe Security Council should be called upon to submit not\r\nonly an annual report but also special reports to the General\r\nAssembly on the important measures taken in the discharge\r\nof its mandate, as a step towards greater accountability of\r\nthe Council to the general membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nSecondly, we believe that the Council needs to make\r\ngreater use of preventive action as an indispensable tool\r\nin coping with potential conflict situations. My delegation\r\nconcurs with the Secretary-General’s recommendation for\r\nmore proactive use of a preventive monitoring presence\r\nin areas of potential conflict and the deployment of\r\npreventive peacekeeping missions. Based on this belief,\r\nwe welcomed the establishment by the Secretary-General\r\nof the Trust Fund for Preventive Action and have\r\ncontinued to make contributions to the Fund since its\r\ninception in 1997. We call upon members who have not\r\ndone so to make their financial and other resources\r\navailable to this Fund in order to enhance the\r\nSecretary-General’s ability to take preventive measures.\r\nThirdly, as the Council has progressively expanded\r\nits involvement in a wider range of divergent issues, one\r\nof the key areas of our debate on the Council’s report in\r\nrecent years has been on how to enhance transparency in\r\nthe Council’s work. Given the growing role and\r\nresponsibility of the Council in dealing with crisis\r\nsituations throughout the world, as demonstrated most\r\nrecently in the cases of Kosovo and East Timor, the\r\nUnited Nations membership in general and non-members\r\nof the Council in particular which are parties directly or\r\npotentially involved in the situation, have an increasingly\r\ngreater interest in taking part, in one way or another, in\r\nthe Council’s decision-making process.\r\nOf course, we share the concern of some Members\r\nthat transparency might undermine the efficiency of the\r\nconduct of business in the Council. However, when the\r\ndecision-making process has financial or other\r\nimplications for non-members of the Council, we believe\r\nthat the need for efficiency should give way to\r\ntransparency for the sake of mustering broader support of\r\nthe general membership. Overall, we consider that the\r\nworking method of the Council should be further\r\nrationalized in a manner conducive to ensuring greater\r\ntransparency and better efficiency in its work.\r\nIn this connection, we appreciate some\r\nimprovements made over the past year in the briefings\r\ngiven by the Presidency on the contents of the Council’s\r\ninformal consultations. First, such briefings to\r\nnon-members are now given almost immediately after the\r\ninformal consultations, ensuring real-time transparency in\r\nthe work of the Council. Secondly, such briefings these\r\ndays contain more substantive matters, enabling\r\nconstructive information-sharing among the general\r\nmembership. We highly commend those Council\r\nPresidents who went the extra mile for their non-member\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\ncounterparts to give real-time, first-hand information on a\r\ndaily basis about the contents of the informal consultations,\r\nthus greatly contributing to the promotion of transparency\r\nin the work of the Council.\r\nLet me now turn to several technical aspects of the\r\nannual report before us. First, we note with satisfaction that\r\nthe report now carries with it an addendum of optional\r\nmonthly assessments by former Presidents of the work of\r\nthe Council during the reporting period. We believe that\r\nwith this addendum the report has become a more\r\nsubstantive and analytical source of information on the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the practice by which\r\nthe Council Presidents over the past year provided the\r\ngeneral membership with their respective monthly\r\nassessments of the Council’s work. We hope that the\r\npractice of distributing the monthly assessment of the\r\nPresident promptly to the general membership as an official\r\ndocument will continue.\r\nSecondly, we welcome the inclusion in Part V of the\r\nannual report of substantive information on the work of the\r\nsubsidiary bodies of the Security Council as an integral part\r\nof the Council’s report. The report now covers the activities\r\nof such subsidiary organs as the sanctions committees, the\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission and the International\r\nTribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and the\r\ninformation contained therein has also been greatly\r\nimproved. We are particularly satisfied that for the first\r\ntime the Council has decided to incorporate the annual\r\nreports of the sanctions committees into the Council’s\r\nreport as appendices. As a long time advocate of such\r\npractices, we hope to see this continue in the future.\r\nBefore concluding, my delegation wishes to reiterate\r\nits willingness to work closely with the President and with\r\nother delegations in our common effort to promote\r\ntransparency, efficiency and rationalization of the working\r\nmethods of the Council. With this in mind, I take the\r\nopportunity to assure the Assembly that my delegation will\r\ncontinue to do its utmost to contribute to the work of the\r\nupcoming meetings of the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council, under the President\u0027s\r\nable guidance.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): My delegation is participating in the general\r\ndiscussion of the Security Council report because of its\r\ngreat importance. This is an opportunity for Member States\r\nto review the work of the Council and evaluate its activities\r\nin the performance of its duties related to preserving\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWhen the General Assembly discussed previous\r\nreports of the Council, Member States made many\r\nremarks pertaining to the Council\u0027s working methods.\r\nConstructive proposals were made to improve its annual\r\nreport in form and substance.\r\nBefore dealing with the contents of the present\r\nreport, I should like to take the opportunity to express our\r\nappreciation to Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, the President\r\nof the Security Council for this month, for his clear\r\nbriefing on the Council\u0027s report.\r\nThe report before us was based mostly on the\r\nelements included in the note by the President of the\r\nCouncil of June 1997, with one additional chapter for the\r\nannual reports of the sanctions committees.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the initiatives taken by the\r\nCouncil and the Secretariat to improve the Council\u0027s\r\nworking methods. Yet these improvements, in our\r\nopinion, are still limited. The reports should be further\r\nimproved in order to ensure the Council\u0027s high efficiency\r\nand transparency.\r\nThe present report indicates that the Council has\r\nincreased the number of open formal meetings compared\r\nwith previous years. Due to the importance of the subjects\r\ndiscussed in those meetings, Member States should be\r\ninformed in advance of the subjects to be discussed so as\r\nto be prepared prior to the decision-making process, not\r\nafter it has been completed, since many States find\r\nthemselves faced with previously prepared draft\r\nresolutions that tackle issues that are important to them.\r\nWe welcome consultations with troop-contributing\r\ncountries, but we stress the importance of implementing\r\nthe provisions of Article 31 of the Charter, which\r\nprovides that non-members of the Council may participate\r\nin the discussions if the interests of those countries are\r\nspecially affected.\r\nThe report mentions that the Council held 239 closed\r\nconsultation meetings and gives the dates and the reports\r\ndiscussed in them. It also states that they lasted for a total\r\nof 511 hours, but does not include, even briefly, the\r\nopinions voiced by members of the Council during those\r\nmeetings. This is a source of major concern to us. We\r\nunderstand that the work of a limited group of States\r\ncould in some instances be useful in facilitating the search\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nfor a solution to the conflicts before the Council, but we\r\nobject to the excessive reliance on informal consultations\r\nthat could destroy the transparency of the Council. The\r\nconsultations prevent the overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States from participating in discussions of the\r\nissues. What is of interest for the international community\r\nis not the number of meetings or hours, but the content of\r\nthe discussions.\r\nWe would like here to make the following important\r\npoints.\r\nFirst, when did the Council begin holding such\r\nmeetings, and why? The Council is master of its own\r\ndecisions, but it is also possible, to an extent, that it could\r\nmake decisions surreptitiously, without the knowledge of\r\nthe international community or without its participation.\r\nThe Charter provides for the exact opposite.\r\nSecondly, we would like to stress the importance of\r\nholding more open and public meetings, with the\r\nparticipation of the States parties, to discuss the issues on\r\nthe Council\u0027s agenda.\r\nWe believe that the Council should be guided by the\r\nopinions and proposals of Member States, and therefore we\r\nare not convinced that the General Assembly should only\r\ntake note of the Council\u0027s report, in view of its extreme\r\nimportance. We believe that Members should be given the\r\nopportunity to form their opinions regarding the report and\r\nto present their recommendations to the Council in\r\naccordance with Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter.\r\nWe further believe that it is unacceptable that the\r\nCouncil should continue to use provisional rules of\r\nprocedure that are more than half a century old and whose\r\nprovisions do not apply to the informal consultations that\r\nhave become the most used framework for the Council\u0027s\r\nactivities.\r\nThe Security Council held many meetings devoted to\r\ndiscussing the problems of certain African countries — a\r\nfact that we appreciate. However, it is a source of concern\r\nto us that the Council deals with other regional problems,\r\ntakes appropriate measures and produces efficient and\r\neffective resolutions, but only pays lip service to, and\r\nexpresses the best of intentions about, African issues.\r\nWe believe that the Council should take practical steps\r\nto address African problems, taking into account the\r\npriorities of the African countries themselves, and\r\ncoordinate its work with them to resolve these problems.\r\nThis approach would break the cycle of violence that\r\ndestroys the security of many countries of the African\r\ncontinent and would enable peace to be established and\r\nsustainable development to be implemented.\r\nThe period under review is very important in the\r\ncontext of the history of the problems that the Council\r\nhas addressed in different parts of the world. We realize\r\nthat the Council bears the major responsibility for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, but the\r\nCharter also provides for the General Assembly to\r\nparticipate in laying down the general guidelines that\r\nwould help achieve that purpose. If the Security Council\r\ncannot tackle serious problems independently, it should\r\ncooperate with the General Assembly, in accordance with\r\nthe provisions of the Charter, to solve many of them.\r\nThe Security Council\u0027s report tackles, in chapter 16,\r\nthe report of the sanctions committee concerning the\r\nsanctions imposed on the Libyan people. In connection\r\nwith lifting those sanctions, in implementation of\r\nparagraph 16 of Security Council resolution 883 (1993),\r\nparagraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1192 (1998)\r\nclearly states that Libya has fulfilled its obligations in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions. Yet the\r\nUnited States has prevented the Council from taking a\r\ndecision to lift the sanctions. The United States\r\nGovernment has used three arguments to justify that\r\nposition. First, it says that Libya supports terrorism. The\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report refutes that claim completely,\r\nand the facts of the matter assert that Libya has not\r\nsupported terrorism; it has, rather, supported the\r\nlegitimate struggle of national liberation movements,\r\nespecially in African countries. Secondly, it is said, Libya\r\nhas not cooperated with the Scottish tribunal. Libya has\r\nindeed cooperated, and we have clearly stated on several\r\noccasions that we are more than willing to cooperate with\r\nthat tribunal to have the sanctions lifted.\r\nThirdly, and most curiously, the United States claims\r\nthat we should pay damages to the families of the victims\r\nof Pan Am 103, even before the issue has been settled in\r\ncourt. We can pay damages only when a court decision is\r\ntaken. The American claim undermines the rules of\r\ninternational law, as well as human rights. It is a widely\r\nknown legal principle that a suspect is innocent until\r\nproven guilty. The claim of the United States erodes\r\nhuman rights by completely denying the possibility of the\r\ninnocence of the suspects. Using the logic of that\r\nargument, we could demand damages for all the suffering\r\nthat we have undergone for seven years and that has\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\ncaused us human losses and tremendous material losses that\r\nreached billions of dollars.\r\nWhen the Members of the United Nations mandated\r\nthe Security Council to work on their behalf, they\r\npresupposed that the Council would take into account their\r\nopinions and positions with regard to the issues under\r\nconsideration. With regard to the situation I have just\r\nmentioned, one can clearly see that a single State has\r\ndisregarded the positions of most members of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThis is a very dangerous trend that should be checked.\r\nOne cannot disregard the will of the overwhelming majority\r\nof the international community, the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, the Organization of African Unity, the League\r\nof Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference — all of which have formally and repeatedly\r\nrequested the immediate and total lifting of the sanctions\r\nimposed on the Libyan people. They are all convinced that\r\nLibya has fulfilled all its obligations towards Security\r\nCouncil demands regarding the Lockerbie case. A single\r\nState cannot stand in the way of the will of the international\r\ncommunity. Preserving the fait accompli will enforce the\r\nwill of a single State and not the will of the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the international community.\r\nMr. Larraín (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Allow me,\r\nfirst of all, to express my delegation\u0027s gratitude to\r\nAmbassador Sergey Lavrov, Permanent Representative of\r\nthe Russian Federation and President of the Security\r\nCouncil for the month of October, for his valuable\r\npresentation to the Assembly of the Council\u0027s annual report.\r\nWe would also like to extend our thanks to the Secretariat\r\nfor the efforts it made in presenting a comprehensive and\r\ntimely report.\r\nThis report, which is issued in compliance with a duty\r\nenshrined in the Charter, has a very important ritual\r\nsignificance. It symbolizes the cooperation that should exist\r\nbetween two bodies, the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. It is also the product of the legal fiction\r\naccording to which the Council acts on behalf of all the\r\nmembers of the Organization. These circumstances alone\r\nwould justify its existence. But beyond performing a ritual\r\nfunction between the two bodies, the report should also\r\nachieve the basic objective for which it was created,\r\nnamely, to inform. We can therefore ask ourselves whether\r\nits present format allows it to carry out that objective.\r\nIn order to answer that question we would first have\r\nto spell out what type of information the Member States, on\r\nwhose behalf the members of the Council act, require.\r\nSecondly, we would have to examine what other means\r\nof information are available to them. From the replies to\r\nthese questions we will be able to determine whether the\r\nreport meets the Member States\u0027 requirements for\r\ninformation.\r\nWithout trying to be comprehensive, I would venture\r\nto reply that with regard to information, what we would\r\nlike to know about first is the existence of situations that\r\nendanger international peace and security. We would like\r\nto be informed in a timely manner about such situations\r\nand know what the motives and elements are that\r\ncharacterize such conflicts — for instance, who the\r\nparties in conflict are, what the dimensions and political\r\nchallenges of the conflict are, what the humanitarian\r\nsituation and the status of the conflict on the ground are,\r\nand so on. In this regard, it would be very important for\r\nthe States that are not members of the Council to have\r\ntimely access to any information that could be provided\r\nby the Secretariat, the special envoys and personal\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General and the parties to\r\nthe conflict.\r\nInformation should serve one objective, and that is\r\nto enable countries to assess what is taking place, take\r\npositions, intervene and contribute to the solving of\r\nconflicts. In reality, however, the information provided by\r\nthe annual report does not meet that need. The annual\r\nnature of the report, which appears long after the events\r\nit deals with have occurred, means that its interest is\r\nprimarily historic.\r\nSecondly, we Member States are interested in\r\nfinding out how the Council is handling a conflict. In that\r\nregard, we would like to know what alternatives are being\r\nconsidered and what positions are being taken by the\r\nmembers of the Council. This is particularly important in\r\nthe case of the non-permanent members, whom we elect\r\nevery year.\r\nThe legal fiction that the Council is acting on our\r\nbehalf should come closer to the truth. We believe in an\r\nideal situation in which the Member States can aspire to\r\na feeling of sharing a particular political sensitivity with\r\nthose who represent us in the Council.\r\nWith regard to the Latin American region, I would\r\nlike to place on the record our gratitude to the delegations\r\nof Argentina and Brazil for the tremendous effort they\r\nmade to brief us during their period of service on the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nThe fact that the permanent members are not elected\r\ndoes not exempt them from the duty to provide an\r\nincreasing flow of information to the non-member States.\r\nOnce again, the legal fiction that they act on our behalf\r\nshould progressively converge with reality. Although it is\r\ntrue that the permanent members of the Security Council\r\nare not the object of scrutiny, that does not free them from\r\nthe duty — at least from a moral and practical point of\r\nview — to be aware of the feelings of the other members\r\nof the Organization, on whose behalf they act. These\r\nfeelings can only be accurate if the Member States are well\r\ninformed as to what is happening in the Council.\r\nThe process of providing information does not end\r\nwith the annual report we are considering today. Providing\r\ninformation is a permanent exercise that should take place\r\nat all levels and stages. Obviously, information will be\r\nbetter and more abundant where transparency prevails, and\r\nin this regard there is a great deal to be done.\r\nWhen we served on the Council in 1997, we had the\r\nhonour of signing a document, along with the other nine\r\nnon-permanent members, suggesting a series of measures to\r\nimprove the work of the Council, particularly aspects\r\nrelating to transparency. Some of those measures have\r\nalready been taken, while others have not. Many ideas\r\ndesigned to increase the transparency of the Council\u0027s work\r\nare being discussed in detail in the open-ended working\r\ngroup on the reform of the Council. It is important to make\r\nprogress in this area. In order to achieve this it is essential\r\nthat the permanent members be less passive and try to\r\nadapt themselves to new realities.\r\nWith regard to transparency, any progress that has\r\nbeen made is the result of pressure from the rest of the\r\nmembership. That is why we would like the permanent\r\nmembers to be more energetic in developing ways to enable\r\nall of us to be better informed about what is happening in\r\nthe Council. The permanent members sometimes seem to\r\nconfuse the trivial with the fundamental. What is certain is\r\nthat greater transparency will in no way affect their\r\nprivileges; on the contrary, it will give greater legitimacy to\r\ntheir actions, as it does in democratic societies. It is not\r\nhealthy that a feeling should develop that they are separated\r\nfrom us by an ocean of incomprehension. That situation\r\nshould be ended in the interests of the United Nations and\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nI end on an optimistic note. Although the report does\r\nnot completely satisfy our need for information, we must\r\nrecognize that in the past two years progress has been\r\nmade, in particular as a result of the inclusion of the\r\nassessments former Presidents have made at the end of\r\ntheir presidency, and we are grateful to those who have\r\ndone so. We urge the Council to continue to explore,\r\nthrough the Working Group on documentation and\r\nprocedure, ways of improving the report by making it\r\nmore substantive and analytical.\r\nMr. Kasanda (Zambia): I welcome this opportunity\r\nto consider the annual report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly. I wish to thank the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Russian Federation, the President of\r\nthe Council for this month, for presenting the report.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\nactivities of the Security Council, as they have a bearing\r\non the interests and well-being of the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn the recent past the Council has shown its\r\npreparedness to respond positively to the call of the\r\nmajority of Member States for an increased flow and\r\ngreater sharing of information with non-members of the\r\nSecurity Council. During the past year interested\r\nMembers of the United Nations that are not members of\r\nthe Security Council were able to participate in some of\r\nthe Council’s open debates. Additionally, their\r\nunderstanding has been enriched by the daily briefings\r\nand monthly reports of the Security Council President.\r\nThese are encouraging signs of a move towards a more\r\nopen and transparent Security Council. My delegation\r\ntherefore wishes to encourage the Council to continue\r\nthese activities.\r\nWhile this positive trend is appreciated, the Council\r\nneeds to do a good deal more to meet calls by the general\r\nmembership for greater transparency and accountability in\r\nthe way in which it conducts its affairs. Like its\r\npredecessors, this report lists facts without incorporating\r\ninformation about the deliberations of the Council in the\r\nconsultations of the whole. Furthermore, the report does\r\nnot provide an analysis of the matters considered in those\r\nconsultations or of any of the reasons that might have led\r\nto the Council’s taking certain decisions rather than\r\nothers.\r\nThe Security Council has been described by some\r\nMembers as a private negotiating forum. However, this\r\ndescription ignores the fact that, under the Charter, the\r\nCouncil acts on behalf of the entire general membership\r\nof the United Nations. Closed-door meetings will\r\ntherefore continue to reinforce the negative view that the\r\nCouncil neglects its accountability to other members of\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nthe Organization. The Zambian delegation joins previous\r\nspeakers who have called for the Council to meet in open\r\nmeetings more frequently.\r\nThe report also shows that the Council dealt with a\r\ngreat number of subjects affecting the African continent.\r\nHowever, it is one thing to hear and document reports\r\nabout such situations, but quite another to summon the\r\npolitical will to do something about the crises. The action\r\nproposed by the Security Council on Sierra Leone is\r\nappreciated, but the Council is not acting quickly on the\r\nproblem of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In this\r\nregard, the President of Zambia, in his capacity as mediator\r\non behalf of the countries of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community, made important proposals to the\r\nSecurity Council on 21 September 1999 relative to the\r\nimplementation of the ceasefire agreement in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Those proposals are\r\nstill before the Council. I must emphasize that the apparent\r\nslow response on the part of the Security Council may lead\r\nto a breakdown in the confidence and the hope that has\r\nbeen built up by the ceasefire agreement in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. No one wants a vacuum to develop\r\nas that would ultimately lead to a recurrence of war and\r\nfurther violence.\r\nIn fulfilling its role under the Charter for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security in the world, the\r\nSecurity Council should endeavour to be seen to be\r\nconsistent in its reactions to crises, wherever they occur.\r\nThe Security Council should move quickly to erase the\r\nimpression of double standards by according equal\r\ntreatment to all crisis situations in the world.\r\nMr. Dahlgren (Sweden): On 10 September last year,\r\nthe representative of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, Mr. Nicholas Morris, briefed\r\nthe members of the Security Council on the situation then\r\nprevailing in Kosovo. Mr. Morris had just arrived from the\r\nregion, and he gave a very vivid description of the critical\r\nhumanitarian plight of the people of Kosovo. He made the\r\nsuffering of the Kosovars seem very real in the consultation\r\nroom. I was presiding over those consultations as President\r\nof the Security Council at the time, and I had the feeling\r\nthat no one left that room untouched by what we had heard.\r\nShortly afterwards the Council adopted resolution 1199\r\n(1998), which demanded that immediate steps be taken to\r\navert the impending humanitarian catastrophe. Further\r\naction would otherwise be considered by the Council.\r\nI have taken that particular example from the report\r\nwe are discussing today because I believe that it is an\r\nappropriate starting point for addressing some of the\r\ncrucial issues regarding the work of the Security Council\r\nduring the year covered by that report. I will deal in\r\nparticular with two such issues: the credibility of the\r\nSecurity Council, and the openness of the Council; they\r\nare, indeed, related.\r\nAt the time of Mr. Morris’s briefing, the Security\r\nCouncil was very much on top of what was going on in\r\nKosovo. Many delegations worked hard to maintain that\r\norder. We believed that the situation in Kosovo, which\r\ncame to be characterized by massive violations of human\r\nrights, with clear implications for the security of the\r\nregion as a whole, merited resolute action by the Security\r\nCouncil. However, mainly due to the possibility of a veto,\r\nsuch action proved out of reach even as the heinous acts\r\nof “ethnic cleansing” accelerated.\r\nAnother moment in the Council which is vivid in my\r\nmemory was on 16 December 1998. The Security Council\r\nagain held informal consultations of the whole, dealing,\r\nas so often in the past, with Iraq. We were assembled to\r\ndiscuss the latest report of the United Nations Special\r\nCommission regarding flagrant violations by Iraq of its\r\nobligations under United Nations resolutions. Halfway\r\nthrough our discussions, the meeting was interrupted, as\r\nwe were informed by people coming in from the so-called\r\n“silent room”, where they had been watching CNN, that\r\nunilateral action was already being taken by two States,\r\nboth permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nI could add to those two examples a third. I am\r\nreferring to the veto of yet another permanent member,\r\ncast at the height of tensions in the Balkans, in effect\r\nputting an end to the United Nations Preventive\r\nDeployment Force (UNPREDEP) in the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia — one of the more successful\r\npreventive United Nations missions.\r\nI have given those three examples because to my\r\nmind they reflect situations which, for different reasons,\r\nhave contributed to a debate that cannot be ignored.\r\nKosovo, Iraq and UNPREDEP represent three issues\r\nwhere the credibility of the Security Council has been\r\nseriously questioned. For those of us — I believe that we\r\nare many — who put our trust in the United Nations as\r\nthe ultimate upholder of peace and human dignity, and\r\nwho firmly believe that the Security Council must carry\r\nout its primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, this debate is a very\r\nserious one.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nOne key question today is how the credibility of the\r\nCouncil can be restored. To my delegation, the answer lies\r\nin how the members of the Security Council make the best\r\nuse of its full potential. In our view, this entails several\r\nsteps: first, to take action earlier. True preventive work is\r\nstill virtually absent from the Council agenda, and as a\r\nconsequence the Council is confronted with urgent\r\nemergencies and will constantly be perceived to be doing\r\ntoo little too late. Better use must be made of preventive\r\ntools, many of which are provided by the Charter.\r\nPrevention, of course is a question both of information and\r\nof political will. The Secretary-General has a key role to\r\nplay in alerting the Council to potential conflicts as early as\r\npossible. Using this information, the Security Council, as\r\nwell as the Secretariat, could focus more on identifying\r\nspecific options available to them before the conflicts hit\r\nthe headlines: by quiet and public means, through activities\r\nin the field and through action here in New York. Let us\r\nnot forget, however, that the key challenge and\r\nresponsibility is that of mobilizing true political will to act.\r\nSecondly, it is the view of my Government that the\r\nsecurity of the individual must be regarded as being as\r\nimportant as the security of States. Human security ought\r\nto be promoted, for example, by putting more emphasis on\r\nthe protection of civilians. Mandates devised by the\r\nSecurity Council should be calibrated to the real tasks at\r\nhand, and there should be no shying away from the real\r\nneeds when it comes to manpower and rules of engagement\r\nrobust enough to protect the personnel who have been sent\r\nout. In the case of sanctions, another Council issue, more\r\ncan also be done to avoid negative humanitarian side-\r\neffects, in the first place through targeted sanctions. The\r\ntrend of revitalizing the sanctions committees to make the\r\nsanctions instrument an effective tool, as has been the case\r\nin Angola, is very welcome.\r\nThirdly, when decisions for action are taken by the\r\nSecurity Council, we as Member States have a clear\r\nresponsibility in the follow-up through rapid deployment of\r\nadequate personnel, both civilian and military.\r\nFourthly, peace and security is a matter of global\r\nconcern. The Security Council must act even-handedly and\r\nwith the same commitment all over the world. It cannot\r\nafford to be perceived as promoting double standards. Some\r\nvery important decisions were indeed taken at the end of\r\nlast year regarding core issues pertaining to peace and the\r\nprevention of conflict in Africa. These range from the\r\nenhancement of regional peacekeeping capacities to curbing\r\nillegal flows of small arms. But such decisions may be of\r\na more generic nature; they should also be translated into\r\ntrue political will of the Security Council to act in\r\nspecific cases — in Africa as much as in other places.\r\nOur fifth point relates to the veto. The veto should\r\nnot be allowed to block the Security Council from\r\nshouldering its responsibilities. This issue will indeed be\r\ndiscussed under another agenda item here in the General\r\nAssembly and perhaps later on in a working group, but a\r\nnumber of interesting suggestions regarding the possibility\r\nof arriving at agreements on how to restrict the use of the\r\nveto were made during the general debate, some of which\r\nwould indeed contribute to increasing the credibility of\r\nthe Council.\r\nFinally, the same is true regarding the composition\r\nof the Security Council. To us, an enlarged Council better\r\nreflecting the general membership of the United Nations\r\nwould act with greater authority and increased credibility,\r\nand thereby increase the security of both individuals and\r\nStates.\r\nAllow me once again to come back to that briefing\r\nby Mr. Morris one year ago in the Security Council\r\nconsultations room regarding the humanitarian situation in\r\nKosovo. That meeting also highlighted, to us, the need for\r\nthe Security Council to be more open to outside expertise\r\nand influence. More can be done by Council members to\r\nallow parties concerned, United Nations agencies and\r\nrelevant non-governmental organizations to contribute to\r\nits deliberations on specific issues. Also, the Security\r\nCouncil would be well served to build on a practice that\r\nhas been developed during the last year more often to\r\nallow the Secretary-General or his representatives,\r\nChairpersons of sanctions committees and others to brief\r\nthe Council in open meetings. This is not only a question\r\nof democracy and transparency — which are important\r\nenough — but also a way for the Security Council to\r\nbetter get messages across to the general membership. We\r\nfeel that measures to involve the membership to a greater\r\nextent in the work of the Council will also contribute to\r\nenhancing its authority. We realize and understand full\r\nwell the need for Council members to deliberate behind\r\nclosed doors when specific situations so require, but we\r\nalso expect substantial briefings to follow such meetings.\r\nGradual improvements in this regard have been duly\r\nnoted during the past year.\r\nI have mentioned but a few, and for the Security\r\nCouncil, perhaps more problematic issues. But before I\r\nconclude I would also like to put on record due credit to\r\nthe Council for its efforts on several other questions on its\r\nagenda, as reflected in the report before the Assembly.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nThe Security Council has indeed asserted itself in\r\nmany areas. In East Timor the Council has shown\r\ncommitment in support of the process, led by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for the East Timorese people to have their say in\r\nthe future of that territory. Peace has also come closer for\r\nthe peoples of Sierra Leone, the Central African Republic\r\nand Guinea-Bissau. The issue of Libya has progressed\r\nconsiderably this year. At the same time, we hope to see\r\nrenewed efforts regarding Iraq, Ethiopia and Eritrea,\r\nAngola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia\r\nand the very tense situation prevailing in Burundi, among\r\nother matters. The endurance and the commitment of the\r\nSecurity Council will be thoroughly tested.\r\nAn important debate was started by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral when on the opening day of the general debate he\r\ndelivered a statement on his annual report on the work of\r\nthe Organization, regarding how far the responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council goes when it comes to humanitarian\r\nemergencies, and when it is faced with massive breaches of\r\nhuman rights or other crimes against civilians. We have put\r\nforward our views on this matter, and they coincide very\r\nmuch with those of the Secretary-General. Here I would\r\njust like to say that we surely realize that the Security\r\nCouncil may not be able to resolve all conflicts. But we as\r\nmembers of the United Nations — and all of us as human\r\nbeings — have reason to expect that the Council will at all\r\ntimes manifest a serious effort to stop human suffering\r\nresulting from threats to peace, no matter where they occur.\r\nThat is indeed a heavy burden that falls on its 15\r\nmembers. We know that the Charter says that they carry\r\nout their obligations on behalf of all States Members of this\r\nOrganization. Therefore, they must also be able to count on\r\nthe support of us all when they take on this immense task.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): I would like at the outset\r\nto thank the President of the Security Council, Ambassador\r\nSergey V. Lavrov of the Russian Federation, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council. That report,\r\ndocument A/54/2, summarizes the enormous workload the\r\nCouncil carried from 16 June 1998 to 15 June 1999. The\r\n121 open meetings, the 239 informal consultations, the 72\r\nresolutions and the more than 90 reports considered by the\r\nCouncil indicate an increase in the volume of the Council’s\r\nwork and at the same time evidence the increased\r\nexpectations of the international community with regard to\r\nthe Council’s responses to conflicts and disputes.\r\nFollowing the 1997 decision of the Council, an effort\r\nwas indeed made again this year to enhance the analytical\r\nnature of the report by incorporating brief personal\r\nassessments by members of the Council of the months\r\nduring which they served as President; these assessments\r\nare not binding on the Council. An innovation in this\r\nyear’s report is the inclusion of reports of the sanctions\r\ncommittees as an appendix.\r\nWhile we view these additions to the report as\r\nefforts towards further transparency in the work of the\r\nCouncil and towards greater participation by the United\r\nNations membership at large, we feel that still more can\r\nbe done, especially in the following areas.\r\nFirst, more information is needed on the proceedings\r\nof the informal meetings of the Council. Full\r\ntransparency, which is as important as efficiency, should\r\nbe seen in the light of accountability. In this regard, we\r\nsupport the idea of convening consultation meetings of\r\nthe Security Council open to the general membership.\r\nSecond, in the voting procedures of the Council,\r\nthere are occasions where the Council votes on a draft\r\nresolution and proceeds thereafter to debate the very\r\nresolution which has already been adopted. We believe\r\nthat, except in extraordinary situations of urgency, which\r\nare very rare indeed, the sequence should be reversed,\r\nespecially on issues which usually draw a considerable\r\nnumber of non-member speakers. Such a sequence should\r\nalso enhance the positive impressions made by the United\r\nNations on viewers of the Council\u0027s proceedings.\r\nThird, while we understand the beneficial effects of\r\ninformal consultation meetings, we feel they should be\r\nused sparingly, not routinely as they are today, when they\r\nfar surpass in number the regular open meetings. The\r\nCouncil must do more towards increasing the participation\r\nof non-members of the Council in its deliberations.\r\nClosed meetings frustrate such participation.\r\nFourth, there should be more restraint on the part of\r\nthe Council with regard to issues which may be\r\nconsidered to fall within the domain of the General\r\nAssembly. Expansion of the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil in matters of peace and security is a welcome\r\nphenomenon. The expansion of the activities of the\r\nSecurity Council, however, in issues which may be within\r\nthe domain of the General Assembly does not conform to\r\nthe division of work between the two most important\r\norgans of the United Nations. The need for close\r\ncoordination between them cannot be overemphasized.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nFifth, we are willing to consider and discuss the\r\nproposal by Germany of reporting to the General Assembly\r\nthe reasons for the use of a veto.\r\nSixth, we support the Indian proposal as to the\r\nincorporation in the annual report of an assessment by the\r\nCouncil itself of the usefulness and helpfulness of its\r\nactions.\r\nSeventh, we reiterate our belief that greater\r\ncollaboration between the United Nations and the regional\r\norganizations is needed, as provided under Chapter VIII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nEighth, sanctions cause economic losses, creating\r\nproblems for neighbouring States and for all those countries\r\nthat have to observe them. The Security Council needs to\r\nbecome more sensitive to these problems, as well as to the\r\ngeneral humanitarian impact of sanctions, and should\r\ntherefore be more selective so as to affect those targeted\r\nand not innocent people.\r\nWe attach great importance to the item under\r\nconsideration. The Security Council, being the United\r\nNations organ entrusted with primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security and whose decisions are\r\nbinding, as determined by the Charter, plays a key role\r\nwhich affects the international community as a whole.\r\nThough more needs to be done, we are happy to concede\r\nthat progress has been made in recent years towards\r\nameliorating the working methods of the Council, especially\r\nin transparency. The evidence of the progress made by the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the working methods of the\r\nCouncil is therefore obvious.\r\nThe delegation of Cyprus will have more to say on the\r\nworking methods of the Council during the discussion of\r\nthe item entitled “Equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters.” We would just like to state at present that an\r\nequitable increase in the Council\u0027s permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats, so as to render it representative, will go a\r\nlong way towards earning the confidence of the general\r\nmembership.\r\nRepresenting a country whose problem remains\r\ninscribed on the agenda of this body and on the agenda of\r\nthe Security Council, and expecting a just solution, I would\r\nlike to express the appreciation of my Government to the\r\nmembers of the Council for their contribution and to\r\ncongratulate the five newly elected members, while\r\npledging at the same time our cooperation and full support.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): I wish to join other\r\ndelegations in thanking the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, Mr. Sergey Lavrov of the Russian Federation,\r\nfor his lucid and concise introduction of this year\u0027s report\r\nof the Security Council (A/54/2) covering the period 16\r\nJune 1998 to 15 June 1999.\r\nThe annual discussion of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil clearly illustrates the symbiotic relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council\r\nas the United Nations seeks to pursue the cause of\r\ninternational peace and security. Before addressing the\r\nsubstance of the report, allow me to make a few\r\ncomments on some procedural matters.\r\nMy delegation has noted that considerable effort has\r\nbeen made to give effect to the principle of transparency.\r\nOpen debates of the Security Council have to a large\r\nextent allowed Member States to participate in the\r\ndeliberations and to be directly informed about the\r\nproceedings of the Council. We welcome this\r\ndevelopment, and we wish to offer for consideration the\r\nfact that further transparency could be facilitated if there\r\nexisted a mechanism allowing countries which are\r\ninvolved in disputes to brief members of the Security\r\nCouncil during informal meetings.\r\nThe regular statements to the press, as well as the\r\nbriefings for non-members, have also been very useful.\r\nWe especially appreciate the availability of the Council\u0027s\r\nprogramme of work and statements made to the press on\r\nsome Missions\u0027 Web sites. The monthly reports of the\r\nPresidents of the Council have proved to be an effective\r\nmedium through which the activities of the Council can\r\nbe reviewed. It would be useful, however, if these reports\r\ncould be more analytical in content instead of being a\r\ncompilation of documents.\r\nIt was gratifying to note that efforts continue to be\r\nmade to improve the methods of work of the Security\r\nCouncil. We also note that non-papers have been\r\npresented by past and present members of the Council\r\naimed at improving the Council\u0027s work. The measures\r\nsuggested in these non-papers, we believe, could serve as\r\na basis for action by the Council.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations has ascribed to\r\nthe Security Council the primary role in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. While one agrees that\r\ncollective security and responding to crises and\r\nemergencies must be the major focus of its activities, we\r\nconcur with the observation made by Secretary-General\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nKofi Annan, in paragraph 58 of his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/54/1), that “reaction, and not\r\nprevention, has been the dominant Security Council\r\napproach in dealing with conflict over the years.”\r\nPreventive action by the United Nations encompasses a\r\nbroad range of political, economic, social and humanitarian\r\nmeasures aimed at averting or de-escalating the\r\ndevelopment of conflict.\r\nMy delegation is heartened that in recent years, the\r\nCouncil has shown increased interest in tackling these\r\nissues in extensive debates on post-conflict peace-building\r\nand on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa, as well as\r\nthrough the endorsement of a range of conflict-prevention\r\nmeasures. We welcome the continuous dialogue between\r\nthe Security Council and the Secretary-General on\r\npreventive measures and encourage cooperation between the\r\nSecurity Council and other organs of the United Nations.\r\nWe note that threats to peace have become more or\r\nless pandemic. Ethnic strife and political divisiveness have\r\ncontinued to fuel internal conflict, leading to heavy loss of\r\nlife, economic disruption and regional instability. The\r\nSecurity Council cannot afford to divorce itself from this\r\nphenomenon and must pronounce itself in pragmatic ways.\r\nAs was clearly articulated in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization, the past\r\ndecade has been one of tension and difficulty for the United\r\nNations in fulfilling its collective security mandate. We\r\nnote that earlier this year the Security Council was\r\nprecluded from intervening in the Kosovo crisis by\r\nprofound disagreements between Council members over\r\nwhether such an intervention was legitimate. The dilemma\r\nwe face is the search for an acceptable threshold.\r\nWhen is the level of human suffering within a country\r\nof such a magnitude as to warrant international action?\r\nQuestions concerning the principle of intervention, the use\r\nof force, the scale of military enforcement and the role of\r\nthe Security Council are all relevant. The debates on these\r\nquestions have revealed differing perspectives, as well as\r\nelements of consensus, on the applicable principles of\r\ninternational law. In recent times we have witnessed\r\natrocities committed as a result of the practice of ethnic\r\ncleansing, as communities rise up against each other to\r\nsettle old grievances. We must all continue to condemn\r\nthese practices and understand the need for some kind of\r\naction to halt such excesses, which violate international\r\nhumanitarian norms.\r\nBy the same token, however, we believe that the\r\nprinciples of international law affecting sovereignty and\r\nthe use of force cannot be ignored. The Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica, in\r\nhis address to the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly advocated the adoption of an approach which\r\n“has the confidence of the international community\r\nwhereby diplomatic and any necessary enforcement\r\naction is taken or authorized by the multilateral\r\ninstitutions entrusted with safeguarding international\r\npeace and security.” (A/54/PV.17)\r\nIn this regard, we share the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that\r\n“enforcement actions without Security Council\r\nauthorization threaten the very core of the\r\ninternational security system founded on the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.” (A/54/1, para. 66)\r\nAfrican issues have dominated the agenda of the\r\nSecurity Council for some time. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/52/871) on the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace in Africa has been the\r\nspringboard for discussion and action on African issues.\r\nWe share the concern of the Secretary-General that too\r\nlittle attention is given to the conflicts arising in Africa,\r\ndespite the enormous toll in loss of life, disruptions and\r\nsuffering resulting from armed insurgencies and\r\ninter-State conflicts.\r\nIn addition to the substance of the report, Jamaica\r\nattaches great importance to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. In this regard, we commend the efforts of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group in the conduct of its\r\nextensive discussions. Those discussions have generated\r\nmany concrete ideas and proposals pertaining to the\r\ndecision-making process of the Council, as well as to its\r\nstructure. We believe that some of these discussions could\r\ncontribute to making the Council more effective and\r\nefficient. We are therefore disappointed that further\r\nprogress has not been achieved and that the realization of\r\nthe reform of the Security Council remains a distant hope.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to reiterate that the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council can be measured\r\nonly by its ability to address the challenges to\r\ninternational peace and security. The Council must be\r\ngeared to the current realities of the international\r\ncommunity while upholding the principles enshrined in\r\nthe Charter.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nLet me take this opportunity to convey my\r\nGovernment’s sincere appreciation to the members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for electing Jamaica to serve as a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council for the period\r\n2000-2001. Please be assured that Jamaica will seek to\r\neffectively discharge its responsibilities as a non-permanent\r\nmember of the Council during our tenure.\r\nMr. Ibrahim (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): I wish first\r\nof all to thank the current President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Sergey Lavrov, Permanent Representative of\r\nthe Russian Federation, for having clearly and succinctly\r\npresented the report of the Security Council for the period\r\n16 June 1998 to 15 June 1999. I would also like to thank\r\nthe Secretariat for its efforts in the preparation of this\r\nimportant document, and the members of the Security\r\nCouncil for their great efforts in tackling the difficult task\r\nentrusted to them by the Charter and the Member States. I\r\nwish to congratulate Tunisia, Mali, Bangladesh, Ukraine\r\nand Jamaica for having been elected non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nThe presentation of this report to the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session reflects the solid ties\r\nbetween these two bodies and their shared interest in\r\npeacekeeping and international security. The report reviews\r\nin detail the items considered by the Council and its various\r\nactivities, as well the activities of the Council’s subsidiary\r\nbodies.\r\nWhile we welcome the report and appreciate the\r\nimprovements in the quality of the information provided\r\nand the addition of sections, such as the one on the work of\r\nthe sanctions committees, we feel that the level of analysis\r\nmust be increased so that Member States can be given more\r\ndetailed information as well as an evaluation of the work of\r\nthe Council. This evaluation should include a discussion of\r\nthe effectiveness of past Council actions in dealing with\r\nconflicts. Such analysis is essential. We also insist that the\r\nGeneral Assembly be given the opportunity to play a more\r\nactive role in the area of international peace and security.\r\nPast experience has shown that sanctions imposed by\r\nthe Security Council against certain countries have not met\r\nthe Council’s stated objectives. The sanctions have caused\r\nenormous damage and harm and have led to horrible human\r\ntragedies, as has been the case in Iraq.\r\nWhile confirming our recognition of the right of the\r\nSecurity Council to impose sanctions under Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, we feel that greater caution must be exercised\r\nin the adoption of such measures. Such consideration\r\nshould focus, inter alia, on the consequences of the\r\nsanctions for the States concerned as well as for third\r\nparties. This need is clearly stipulated in the Charter.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has close historical ties to\r\nAfrica, and thus we are concerned about the deterioration\r\nof the situation in the Horn of Africa and in both Central\r\nand East Africa. The leaders of my country continue to\r\nstrive to reach solutions in cooperation with our friendly\r\nbrotherly countries. In this respect, my country calls upon\r\nthe Security Council to give great attention to the\r\nconflicts in Africa, to help put an end to humanitarian\r\ncatastrophes and to support the efforts of the Organization\r\nof African Unity to achieve that goal.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen supports the goal of\r\nreforming the United Nations, the Security Council in\r\nparticular. Therefore we support the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup. We urge the Working Group to conclude its work\r\nas soon as possible, bearing in mind the ongoing critical\r\nchanges that are taking place in the world.\r\nWe hope that, at the threshold of the third\r\nmillennium, the Security Council will become a more\r\nopen, democratic and transparent body, faithfully\r\nreflecting the aspirations and hopes of the Member States\r\nand of the world’s peoples for a better future for all\r\nmankind, so that all may enjoy peace, security and\r\nstability.\r\nMr. Balzan (Malta): The significant number of\r\ndelegations choosing to speak on this agenda item\r\nillustrates the interest and paramount importance attached\r\nto the report of the Security Council as the organ with\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity — a responsibility that reflects in the clearest of\r\nmanners the objectives set forth in the Charter that gave\r\nbirth to this Organization. The Security Council as\r\noriginally envisaged was meant to ensure that the cause\r\nof peace would be more effectively served by a smaller\r\ngroup of States, sitting permanently or temporarily on the\r\nCouncil, not in their own interests, but in the interest of\r\nthe international community. The debate on this report is\r\nanother expression of the accountability that these\r\nmembers owe to the general membership of the\r\nOrganization as a result of that greater responsibility.\r\nThe members of the secretariat of the Security\r\nCouncil deserve our thanks for the arduous work that\r\nmust have gone into the publication of this voluminous\r\ndocument. The inclusion in the report of the Council\r\nPresidents’ monthly assessments and press statements\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 October 1999\r\nmake the document more informative and complete.\r\nNevertheless, it will remain difficult for the document to\r\nsatisfy the non-members’ interest in gaining an\r\nunderstanding of the rationale behind the actions of the\r\nCouncil so long as it continues to reflect its over-reliance\r\non informal consultations as its primary method of work.\r\nThe involvement of the general membership of the\r\nOrganization in the workings of the Security Council\r\nremains hampered by the practice whereby the real debates\r\nand deliberations take place behind closed doors, while only\r\nthe official adoption of the resolutions takes place in open\r\nsessions of the Council. While Malta welcomes the few\r\ndeviations from this method of work witnessed in the past\r\nyear, it is hoped that they will he more frequent in the\r\nyears to come. The adoption of a practice whereby briefings\r\nfrom the Secretariat are delivered in open Chamber would\r\nperhaps be a positive move in the right direction. In this\r\ncontext, Malta welcomes the views expressed by the\r\ndelegation of Ireland.\r\nFor what is to be gained from keeping the often\r\nunpleasant details of the situation on the ground from the\r\ngeneral membership of the Organization? Undoubtedly, the\r\ndivulging of this information can only help non-members to\r\nbetter understand the eventual decisions of the Council. It\r\nwould also add to the conviction with which non-members\r\nconform to those decisions which they are duty-bound to\r\nimplement and would enhance the involvement and support\r\nthey already give to the work of the Council in places such\r\nEast Timor and Kosovo.\r\nTaking action in areas experiencing precarious\r\nhumanitarian situations is in the nature of the Security\r\nCouncil and its onerous mandate. At times, even positive\r\nand necessary action on the part of the Security Council\r\nmay instigate population movements with humanitarian\r\nimplications. The open debates on protection for\r\nhumanitarian assistance to refugees and others in conflict\r\nsituations, children in armed conflict and the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict are a welcome development that\r\nfurther sensitizes decision-makers on these issues.\r\nIndeed, too many of the Security Council’s less\r\nsatisfactory endeavours in the past year relate to the African\r\ncontinent. The case of Angola illustrates a level of\r\nineffectiveness of the Security Council that is cause for\r\nconcern. Not only were several resolutions on the situation\r\nsidelined by the parties to which they were addressed, but\r\nthe sanctions that were imposed were not duly\r\nimplemented. The United Nations Mission there was\r\neventually forced to abandon the field. It is hoped that the\r\nnew initiative on Angola taken by the Council last week\r\nwill meet with greater success. If it is to do so, the\r\nCouncil will require firm leadership and conviction in its\r\nactions. It will also need to provide the swift and solid\r\nsupport that it has shown itself capable of mustering\r\nelsewhere. African members expect no less, especially as\r\ncomparisons continue to be drawn to actions taken in\r\nother regions.\r\nIn concluding, may I extend our congratulations to\r\nthe representatives of Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia\r\nand Ukraine upon their election to the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council and wish them every\r\nsuccess in the discharge of their responsibilities.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the\r\nreport of the Security Council contained in document\r\nA/54/2?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have\r\nthus concluded this stage of our consideration of agenda\r\nitem 11.\r\ns\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.\r\n14\r\n"
