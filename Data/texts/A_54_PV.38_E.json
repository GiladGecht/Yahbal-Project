(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Ingólfsson\r\n(Iceland), Vice-President took the chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 3 (continued)\r\nCredentials of representatives to the fifty-fourth session\r\nof the General Assembly\r\n(b) Report of the Credentials Committee (A/54/475)\r\nThe Acting President: The draft resolution\r\nrecommended by the Credentials Committee in paragraph\r\n14 of its report reads as follows:\r\n“The General Assembly,\r\n“Having considered the report of the Credentials\r\nCommittee and the recommendation contained therein,\r\n“Approves the report of the Credentials\r\nCommittee.”\r\nWe shall now take action on the recommendation of\r\nthe Credentials Committee set forth in paragraph 14 of its\r\nreport.\r\nThe Credentials Committee adopted the draft\r\nresolution without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly\r\nwishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 54/6).\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who wishes\r\nto make a statement in explanation of vote.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote\r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Mahmoudi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I am\r\ntaking the floor to express our reservation regarding the\r\npart of the report of the Credentials Committee contained\r\nin document A/54/475 that pertains to the credentials of\r\nIsrael.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 3.\r\nAgenda item 7\r\nNotification by the Secretary-General under Article\r\n12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/54/398)\r\nThe Acting President: As members are aware, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 12, paragraph\r\n2, of the Charter of the United Nations and with the\r\nconsent of the Security Council, the Secretary-General is\r\nmandated to notify the General Assembly of matters\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nrelative to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity that are being dealt with by the Security Council\r\nand of matters with which the Council has ceased to deal.\r\nIn this connection, the General Assembly has before\r\nit a note by the Secretary-General issued as document\r\nA/54/398.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of that\r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other\r\nelections\r\n(b) Election of twenty-nine members of the Governing\r\nCouncil of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme\r\nThe Acting President: Pursuant to General Assembly\r\ndecision 43/406, the Assembly will proceed to the election\r\nof 29 members of the Governing Council of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) to replace those\r\nmembers whose term of office expires on 31 December\r\n1999.\r\nThe 29 outgoing members are Algeria, Australia,\r\nBenin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chile,\r\nColombia, the Czech Republic, Finland, India, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Kenya, Italy, the Marshall Islands,\r\nMauritania, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Pakistan,\r\nPanama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Samoa, Slovakia,\r\nThailand, Tunisia, Turkey and the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that after 1 January\r\n2000, the following States will still be members of the\r\nGoverning Council: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina,\r\nAustria, Belarus, Belgium, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon,\r\nCanada, China, the Comoros, Cuba, France, Germany,\r\nHungary, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malawi,\r\nNigeria, Norway, the Republic of Korea, the Russian\r\nFederation, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United\r\nStates of America, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.\r\nTherefore, those 29 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, in accordance with rule\r\n92 of the rules of procedure, all elections shall be held by\r\nsecret ballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nHowever, I would like to recall paragraph 16 of\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, whereby the practice\r\nof dispensing with the secret ballot for elections to\r\nsubsidiary organs when the number of candidates\r\ncorresponds to the number of seats to be filled should be\r\nstandard unless a delegation specifically requests a vote\r\non a given election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that\r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that\r\nbasis?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Regarding candidatures, I\r\nhave been informed by the Chairmen of the regional\r\ngroups as follows:\r\nFor the eight seats of the African States, the eight\r\nendorsed candidates are Benin, Burkina Faso, Egypt,\r\nEquatorial Guinea, the Gambia the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Senegal and Uganda.\r\nFor the seven seats of the Asian States, the seven\r\nendorsed candidates are India, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, the Marshall Islands, Pakistan, Samoa, Saudi Arabia\r\nand Thailand.\r\nFor the three seats of the Eastern European States,\r\nthe three endorsed candidates are Poland, the Republic of\r\nMoldova and Slovakia.\r\nFor the five seats of the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States, the five endorsed candidates for the five\r\nseats are the Bahamas, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and\r\nSuriname.\r\nFor the six seats of the Western European and other\r\nStates, the six endorsed candidates are Denmark, Italy, the\r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Turkey and the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nSince the number of candidates endorsed by the\r\nAfrican States, the Asian States, the Eastern European\r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean States and the\r\nWestern European and other States corresponds to the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled in each region, may I take it\r\nthat the General Assembly decides to elect those\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\ncandidates as members of the Governing Council of the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme for a four-year\r\nterm beginning on 1 January 2000?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The following 29 States have\r\nthus been elected members of the Governing Council of the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme for a four-year\r\nterm beginning on 1 January 2000: Bahamas, Benin, Brazil,\r\nBurkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial\r\nGuinea, the Gambia, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nItaly, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Marshall Islands,\r\nMexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland,\r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal,\r\nSlovakia, Suriname, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda and the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nI congratulate the States that have been elected\r\nmembers of the Governing Council of the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (b) of\r\nagenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother appointments\r\n(g) Appointment of members of the Committee on\r\nConferences\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/54/107)\r\nThe Acting President: As indicated in document\r\nA/54/107, since the terms of office of Chile, Fiji, France,\r\nGabon, Japan, Namibia and the Russian Federation will\r\nexpire on 31 December 1999, it is necessary for the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly to appoint, during the\r\ncurrent session, seven members to fill the resulting\r\nvacancies. The members so appointed will serve for a\r\nperiod of three years beginning on 1 January 2000.\r\nAfter consultations with the Chairmen of the groups of\r\nAfrican States, Asian States, Eastern European States, Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States as well as Western\r\nEuropean and other States, I have appointed Chile,\r\nEquatorial Guinea, France, Japan, Namibia, the Philippines\r\nand the Russian Federation as members of the Committee\r\non Conferences, with effect from 1 January 2000.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of these\r\nappointments?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of sub-item (g) of agenda item 17?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 29\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/308)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.12)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Burkina Faso to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.12.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): In\r\nthe context of the General Assembly\u0027s consideration of\r\nagenda item 29, entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference”,\r\nI have the pleasant duty of introducing, on behalf of the\r\nStates members of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), draft resolution A/54/L.12.\r\nIn its preambular part, the draft resolution begins by\r\nrecalling the various relevant resolutions and\r\nrecommendations recognizing the legal existence of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference as a subject of\r\ninternational law, a reality that formed the basis of\r\nresolution 3369 (XXX) of 10 October 1975, by which the\r\nGeneral Assembly decided to invite the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference to participate in the sessions and\r\nthe work of the Assembly in the capacity of observer.\r\nThe draft then spells out the reasons for, and above\r\nall the benefits of, the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\r\nbecause both pursue the same ideal and the same goals.\r\nThese are, at the political level, the quest for peace with\r\na view to bringing about a better and more united world;\r\nat the economic level, the promotion of genuine\r\ndevelopment for the benefit of all countries and all\r\npeoples, which is a sine qua non condition for the\r\nestablishment of the true collective security to which we\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nall aspire; and, at the social level, human freedom through\r\nthe promotion of human security.\r\nIn its operative part, the draft resolution first takes\r\nnote with satisfaction of the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nwhich encourages the United Nations and the OIC to\r\ncontinue to strengthen their cooperation in view of the\r\nincreasingly important role played by the OIC in the\r\ninternational arena, in particular with respect to the\r\nimplementation of the objectives of the United Nations in\r\nthe areas of security, disarmament, decolonization, human\r\nrights, economic development and technical cooperation.\r\nIn this connection, the draft recommends that in order\r\nto render this complementarity even more effective and\r\nharmonious, the United Nations and the OIC should\r\nstrongly encourage meetings, particularly high-level\r\nmeetings, between the leaders of both organizations. It\r\nrecommends also that, if possible, they consider convening\r\nnext year a conference of the two organizations with the\r\ngoal of further strengthening and enhancing their\r\ncooperation through dialogue and consultation.\r\nFurthermore, the text urges that, in view of the special\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the OIC, the\r\nUnited Nations provide technical and other forms of\r\nassistance to the Organization of the Islamic Conference. In\r\norder for such cooperation to remain forever a dynamic\r\nreality, it requests the Secretary-General to report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session on all efforts\r\nundertaken in order for the two organizations to work side\r\nby side towards the same goal.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference, which\r\ncurrently comprises 56 member States and four observers,\r\nis therefore an active force on the international scene of\r\nwhich the international community must take account. The\r\nOIC has proved its maturity and credibility. At its most\r\nrecent regular ministerial meeting, held last July in\r\nOuagadougou, Burkina Faso, several resolutions were\r\nadopted representing the contributions made by the Islamic\r\nUmmah to the establishment of a world of peace and\r\nfraternity. That meeting considered objectively the situation\r\nin Kosovo, in Afghanistan, in Kashmir and in Somalia,\r\namong others. It considered also the issues of globalization,\r\nthe continuing deterioration in the terms of trade and the\r\ndebt problem of the developing countries. It took a hard\r\nlook at the structural distortions and discriminatory\r\ntreatment that are currently undermining the United Nations\r\nsystem and especially the Security Council, and it\r\nadvocated solutions and recommended measures with\r\nrespect to all of these issues. In other words, the OIC has\r\nthus demonstrated that it is an instrument in the service of\r\npeace, development and solidarity among people. It is\r\ntherefore in the interests of the United Nations to use\r\nsuch an instrument in the context of its mission to work\r\ntowards a world of justice and peace.\r\nAs the facts speak for themselves, I do not need to\r\nexplain further. I am firmly convinced that the Assembly\r\nwill fully support draft resolution A/54/L.12, which I have\r\nthe honour of submitting to it for consideration and\r\nadoption.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Bangladesh is happy\r\nto participate in the debate on agenda item 29,\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference” today in the\r\nplenary General Assembly. We commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations for his concise and focused\r\nreport on this agenda item in document A/54/308. We\r\nappreciate his efforts in promoting enhanced cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations.\r\nThe United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC) have been working in close\r\ncooperation in the political, economic, social,\r\nhumanitarian, cultural and technical fields. The two\r\norganizations share common objectives in addressing\r\nglobal issues, including international peace, fundamental\r\nhuman rights and economic and social development. My\r\ndelegation believes that increasing cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OIC and its organs and\r\ninstitutions contributes to the promotion of the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations and its Charter.\r\nWhile my delegation welcomes the strengthening of\r\ncooperation between the two Organizations, allow me to\r\npoint out here that we have not yet been able to be\r\nsuccessful in harnessing the actual mechanism of such\r\ncooperation. The two organizations have actively\r\nparticipated in enhancing the objectives of international\r\npeace and security, development and social justice. We\r\nhave observed with satisfaction that the United Nations,\r\nwith its funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and\r\nthe OIC, with its subsidiary organs and specialized and\r\naffiliated institutions, have been working together to\r\ncomplement each other.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report contains detailed\r\ninformation on actions to follow up the recommendations\r\nof the meetings between the United Nations system and\r\nthe OIC, including cooperation in the field of economic\r\nand social development. From the report, we know that\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nthe United Nations system and concerned OIC institutions\r\nworked closely during the past year in different fields\r\nthrough exchanges of information and other activities. My\r\ndelegation is happy to learn from the report about the level\r\nof active cooperation between the OIC and the International\r\nLabour Organization, the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization, the World Food Programme and\r\nother bodies of the United Nations system.\r\nWe have noticed that in recent years the international\r\ncommunity has prioritized certain areas of cooperation, such\r\nas peace-building, peacekeeping, preventive deployment and\r\npreventive diplomacy. We the members of the OIC have\r\nalso been actively contributing in this regard. We are happy\r\nto observe that the cooperation between United Nations and\r\nthe OIC in this field has been on the increase for quite\r\nsome time. My delegation firmly believes that the\r\ncooperation between the two organizations in these fields\r\nshould continue.\r\nI am happy to announce that my delegation is a\r\nsponsor of draft resolution A/54/L.12, under agenda item\r\n29, on the continuation of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. I\r\nurge States Members of the United Nations to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution by consensus as a mark of solidarity with\r\nthe Islamic world.\r\nMr. Vural (Turkey): It is my privilege to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly this morning on agenda item 29, which\r\ncovers the status of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations has proved to be an important dimension of\r\nthe international system. Since its establishment, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference has acted as an\r\nindispensable forum for cooperation and solidarity among\r\nits member States. We fully believe that the organization\r\nhas the potential to play a more influential role in global\r\nissues.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference is one of\r\nthose major regional organizations which can contribute to\r\nand benefit from the work of the United Nations.\r\nInteraction between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference can address a\r\nvariety of issues, ranging from peacemaking to cultural\r\ndevelopment and from the protection of the environment to\r\nthe fight against terrorism and illicit drug trafficking.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference covers\r\na vast geographical area and a large population dispersed\r\nover four continents. It represents a rich diversity of\r\ncultures and political systems, taking as a common\r\ndenominator the heritage of Islam, a name that literally\r\nderives from the word “peace”. The Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference gains profound historical and political\r\nexperience through its members, which enables it to be an\r\nimportant instrument of peace and stability in the world.\r\nThe report presented by the Secretary-General to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference indicates a\r\nwelcome deepening of relations between the two\r\norganizations through high-level contacts, regular\r\nconsultations and technical meetings. My delegation\r\nsupports this process and calls for its continuation.\r\nThe emphasis given in the report to the potential for\r\ncooperation in the fields of economic and social\r\ndevelopment, and particularly in peacemaking efforts,\r\nwhich are a new and a very important dimension, is\r\ntimely and very important. The prospects of cooperation\r\nin all these fields are, indeed, encouraging. The regular\r\nconsultations between the two organizations, especially on\r\nthe ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, are worth mentioning\r\nin this respect. The priority issues on the agenda of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, such as the\r\nMiddle East, Palestine, Tajikistan, Cyprus, Somalia,\r\nJammu and Kashmir, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nagorny\r\nKarabakh and Kosovo, among others, coincide with the\r\nissues treated at the United Nations. We believe that joint\r\nUnited Nations and OIC peace initiatives could be useful\r\nin some other conflict situations as well.\r\nA general meeting between representatives of the\r\nsecretariats of the United Nations system and of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, and coordination\r\nmeetings of focal points of the organizations and agencies\r\nof the United Nations system and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, to be organized in the year 2000, will\r\ncertainly help consolidate the grounds for cooperation.\r\nThe special meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference to be held at\r\nIstanbul in the first months of next year will permit an\r\nassessment of the activities of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference and will also make it possible to\r\nformulate some ideas on promoting future cooperation\r\nbetween the Organization of the Islamic Conference and\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nMy delegation supports the draft resolution introduced\r\nby the delegation of Burkina Faso, which calls for the\r\nenhancement of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference. We hope\r\nthat such cooperation will further contribute to global\r\nefforts for peace and international solidarity.\r\nMr. Haque (Pakistan): The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) (A/54/308)\r\nsummarizes the progress achieved over the past year by the\r\nUnited Nations system and the OIC in promoting their\r\nshared goals of international peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. It is a matter of satisfaction to my delegation\r\nthat the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference have continued effective contacts and\r\nconsultations on a number of current political issues,\r\nincluding Afghanistan, the Middle East and Palestine,\r\nSomalia and Tajikistan. Their mutually supportive role and\r\ntheir determination to promote negotiations to resolve those\r\nconflicts have received wide international support.\r\nWe believe that it would be useful for the two\r\norganizations to further expand the ambit of such\r\nconsultations to include situations where no progress has\r\nbeen registered despite the fact that those situations may\r\nhave the potential to endanger global peace and security.\r\nJammu and Kashmir is one such issue where cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations would be useful in\r\npromoting a just and equitable solution to the problem in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions on the subject.\r\nWe note with appreciation that cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations system and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference is increasing also in a wide range of\r\nsocio-economic areas of mutual interest. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General includes brief accounts of follow-up\r\naction during the past year by the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations, the International Fund\r\nfor Agricultural Development, the International Labour\r\nOrganization, the International Civil Aviation Organization,\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization and the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund.\r\nWe are of the view that the two sides should continue\r\nto examine ways and means of further expanding and\r\ndiversifying their cooperation by identifying new areas.\r\nEnhanced cooperation would benefit the peoples of the\r\nStates members of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and the membership of the United Nations.\r\nDuring the debate on this agenda item last year, we\r\nexpressed concern over the fact that the Permanent\r\nObserver Mission of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, which has been functioning in New York for\r\nmore than two decades, does not enjoy formal recognition\r\nby the host Government. We expressed the hope that a\r\nmore helpful attitude would be adopted by the host\r\nGovernment. Unfortunately, the OIC mission continues to\r\nbe denied the privileges and immunities which are\r\nessential for its effective functioning. We understand that\r\nthe Government of Switzerland has extended the\r\nnecessary privileges to the OIC Observer Mission in\r\nGeneva, facilitating its interaction with the United Nations\r\nand with the specialized agencies based in that country.\r\nSimilar facilities should be extended to the OIC in New\r\nYork. We would therefore once again urge the host\r\nGovernment to ensure that the OIC Mission is accorded\r\nthe necessary privileges, as envisaged in Article 105 of\r\nthe United Nations Charter and in the relevant provisions\r\nof the United Nations Headquarters Agreement with the\r\nhost country.\r\nI would like to conclude by expressing our\r\nconfidence that cooperation between the United Nations\r\nsystem and the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nwill continue to flourish. Pakistan, as a member of both\r\nthose organizations, will continue to work towards\r\npromoting greater cooperation and coordination between\r\nthe two organizations.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nI should like to begin by expressing my delegation’s deep\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report on the state of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of The Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), contained in document A/54/308. The\r\nreport gives evidence of a most welcome deepening of\r\nrelations between the two organizations through high-level\r\ncontacts, regular consultations and technical meetings.\r\nThe Secretary-General has in fact touched upon a number\r\nof areas on which solid ground for cooperation has\r\nalready been established. This report demonstrates that a\r\nlot has been achieved, although much remains to be done.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference has been taking\r\nplace over many years of sustained interaction in various\r\nspheres of regional cooperation. These close links are a\r\nreal expression of the cooperation and coordination that\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nare required among international organizations. They\r\ndemonstrate that the world Organization and regional\r\narrangements can come together to promote peace and\r\nsecurity around the globe.\r\nThere is no doubt that the relationship between the\r\ntwo organizations is becoming more diversified as far as\r\njoint cooperation is concerned. Foremost among the issues\r\nof concern to the two organizations are matters related to\r\ninternational peace and security, especially those concerning\r\nongoing peacemaking efforts, which constitute a very\r\nimportant dimension of cooperation between the two\r\norganizations. In this respect, joint efforts to resolve the\r\ncontinued crisis in Afghanistan and put an end to the agony\r\nand suffering of the Afghan people is one of the priorities\r\nof the OIC which also figures prominently in the agenda of\r\nthe United Nations. We hope that both organizations will\r\ncontinue to maintain close contacts and exchange views on\r\nthis issue and will try to bring pressure to bear on the\r\nparties concerned to abandon bloodshed and militaristic\r\npolicies and to come to the negotiating table.\r\nWith regard to peacemaking efforts, mention has to be\r\nmade of the efforts undertaken by the OIC to help the\r\ninternational efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis, which\r\nculminated in the negotiations conducted by an OIC\r\nministerial delegation, headed by the Iranian Foreign\r\nMinister, who visited a number of the capitals in Europe,\r\nparticularly in the Balkans. Cooperation between the two\r\norganizations in this respect led to the participation of the\r\nOIC in the framework of OIC/United Nations cooperation\r\nin the Group of Friends of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Kosovo. We are pleased to note that the report\r\nof the Secretary-General is promising in that it shows that\r\nthere has been a broad agreement on the value of regular\r\npolitical consultations between the two organizations.\r\nThe matter of dialogue among civilizations is on the\r\nagenda of the United Nations and the OIC. It has already\r\nbecome one of the main subjects of joint activity between\r\nthe two organizations. The OIC, as a forum composed of\r\nmore than 50 member States, represents one fifth of the\r\nworld\u0027s population, spread over nearly all continents. It\r\nfurther represents a rich diversity of cultures and political\r\nsystems. It is therefore in a position to contribute\r\nconsiderably to the promotion and enrichment of dialogue\r\namong civilizations.\r\nThe OIC began playing an active role in promoting the\r\nidea by organizing the Islamic Symposium on Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations, held in Tehran from 3 to 5 May 1999.\r\nThe symposium, initiated and sponsored by Mr. Seyed\r\nMohammad Khatami, President of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran and Chairman of the Eighth Summit of the OIC,\r\nissued the Tehran Declaration on Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. The OIC\u0027s twenty-sixth session of Foreign\r\nMinisters, in Ouagadougou, adopted the Tehran\r\nDeclaration and further decided to set up an open-ended\r\nhigh-level group of governmental experts to draft a\r\nuniversal declaration on dialogue among civilizations, as\r\nwell as a 10-year plan of action in coordination with the\r\nUnited Nations and other relevant organizations.\r\nSimilarly, on the initiative of the Foreign Minister of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, on 9 and 10 November 1998\r\nthe OIC and the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights jointly organized, at the\r\nUnited Nations Office in Geneva, a seminar entitled\r\n“Enriching the universality of human rights: Islamic\r\nperspectives on the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights”. That seminar, which forms part of a process for\r\nproviding Islamic perspectives on the Universal\r\nDeclaration, was a turning point in the history of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIC,\r\nbecause it dealt with human rights on the one hand, and\r\nbecause it was unprecedented in the 50-year history of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights on the other.\r\nTwenty experts in Islamic law and human rights, selected\r\nby the High Commissioner and the OIC, presented their\r\nviews and perceptions in this seminar. It helped initiate\r\nconvergence of views and understanding between the two\r\norganizations on the important issue of human rights.\r\nMany other activities have been the subject of joint\r\nwork between the OIC and the United Nations. The\r\nIslamic countries have expressed their desire to cooperate\r\nwith the United Nations on issues of significance such as\r\npeacekeeping, confidence-building measures,\r\ndisarmament, protection and preservation of the\r\nenvironment and combating terrorism and illicit\r\ntrafficking in drugs, as well as respect for international\r\nlaw in general and the United Nations Charter in\r\nparticular.\r\nThe issues of common interest to the two\r\norganizations are by no means confined to what I have\r\nattempted to present here. There exist areas of common\r\ndesire and aim which need to be further developed; to this\r\nend, new avenues for better understanding and\r\nstrengthened cooperation in various fields should be\r\nexplored.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, as the Chair of the\r\nEighth OIC Summit, is pleased with the result of many\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nyears of multilateral and regional cooperation. On the eve\r\nof the new millennium, the OIC looks forward to\r\ncontinuing joint activities with the hope and expectation\r\nthat we will be able to undertake on behalf of all citizens\r\nof Islamic countries, as well as human beings across the\r\nglobe, with continued joint activity in areas that are of high\r\npriority for all countries. Without doubt, the new situation\r\nat the international level requires ever closer cooperation\r\nbetween regional organizations and the United Nations. We\r\nshould promote the launching of new programmes, and the\r\nOIC is ready to engage in more meaningful and direct\r\nactivities with the support of the United Nations.\r\nWe are confident that the adoption of draft resolution\r\nA/54/L.12, just introduced by the Ambassador of Burkina\r\nFaso, will serve as another basis for promoting in the\r\ncoming year joint activities which fall within the common\r\npurposes of both organizations, whose goals are to ensure\r\ninternational cooperation in seeking solutions to\r\ninternational economic, social, cultural and humanitarian\r\nproblems.\r\nI wish to close by reaffirming the pledge of my\r\nGovernment, as the Chairman of the Eighth OIC Summit,\r\nto gear our efforts towards the promotion and strengthening\r\nof cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nMr. Shobokshi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): We\r\nare discussing today the agenda item entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference”. In this respect, I wish to express our\r\ndeep appreciation and full support for the report submitted\r\nby the Secretary-General in document A/54/308.\r\nSince its inception in 1969, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC) has been a melting pot for\r\nthinking, opinions and consultations, where member States\r\nexchange expertise and experience, coordinate their\r\npositions and determine common Islamic action to ensure\r\nsocial, economic and cultural progress. It also strives to\r\nensure prosperity and well-being for its peoples, in keeping\r\nwith the principles of peace and justice provided for in the\r\nCharter. Since 1978, when formal cooperation between the\r\nOIC and the United Nations began, this cooperation has\r\ncontinued to expand and to encompass new fields. Recent\r\nefforts and cooperation by the two organizations focusing\r\non some issues have led to positive results, in particular in\r\nthe fields of preventive diplomacy, peaceful settlement of\r\nconflicts and support for and consolidation of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWith its deep commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and the OIC, the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia has been giving moral and\r\nfinancial support to the OIC. This has enabled that\r\norganization to deal with many crises while working to\r\nachieve its objectives. At the same time, the Kingdom of\r\nSaudi Arabia has stressed the importance of the OIC as\r\nan international force for moderation and peace, in\r\naccordance with the tolerant principles of Islam, which\r\nsupport the peaceful settlement of conflicts. The Kingdom\r\nalso welcomes and commends the desire of the two\r\norganizations to continue their close cooperation in\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural fields and their\r\ncommon endeavour towards maintaining international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe OIC has in the past few decades played a\r\nconstructive role in many different fields. In the political\r\nsphere, the OIC has helped contain or defuse many\r\ninternational political conflicts and has worked to promote\r\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts. These efforts have\r\nhad a positive impact on international peace, stability and\r\nsecurity. In the economic and social sphere, the OIC has\r\nbeen seeking the establishment and the promotion of\r\nlarge-scale cooperation among its member countries in\r\norder to ensure economic and social development and to\r\npromote cooperation through multilateral efforts at the\r\ninternational and national levels with a view to\r\nestablishing a more just international economic order. In\r\nthe cultural and educational spheres, the OIC has been\r\nworking to help peoples of the member countries reach\r\nthe necessary level of education to be able to cope with\r\nthe developments of our times while upholding the\r\ntolerant teachings of Islam. At the same time, the OIC is\r\nworking vigorously to present a true image of Islam, in\r\nthe face of efforts by others to link Islam and terrorism,\r\ndespite the fact that the OIC has condemned all forms of\r\nterrorism, including State terrorism.\r\nAlthough 20 years have elapsed since the OIC\r\nUnited Nations permanent mission began its work, the\r\nOIC does not enjoy the same facilities and privileges\r\nenjoyed by the United Nations missions of other regional\r\norganizations in accordance with the United Nations\r\nHeadquarters Agreement. We hope that this issue will\r\nreceive due attention from the authorities responsible for\r\nthe implementation of the Headquarters Agreement so that\r\nthe OIC office can carry out its functions and\r\nresponsibilities in an integrated manner.\r\nIn conclusion I would like to emphasize that my\r\ndelegation fully supports the draft resolution submitted by\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nBurkina Faso, the chairman-in-office of the OIC’s\r\nministerial conference. We hope that the Assembly will\r\nadopt this draft resolution by consensus. We also wish the\r\nOIC and the United Nations every success in their\r\ncooperation in all fields, cooperation aimed at promoting an\r\ninternational community that enjoys peaceful coexistence\r\nand security for the prosperity of all peoples throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): My delegation is pleased to\r\nnote that since the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\n(OIC) became a permanent observer at the United Nations\r\nin 1975, significant progress has been achieved in the\r\ncooperation between the two organizations in the political,\r\neconomic and social areas, as reflected in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on this item. The OIC has participated\r\nactively in meetings of the United Nations and its\r\nsubsidiary organs, and it has also entered into cooperation\r\nagreements with various United Nations subsidiary organs.\r\nBoth organizations have shown a strong commitment to\r\nfinding appropriate solutions to political and economic\r\nissues of common interest and concern. Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OIC has proven to be\r\nan indispensable aspect of international relations.\r\nThe OIC was founded 30 years ago not only to\r\nstrengthen unity and solidarity among the Islamic Ummah\r\ncommunity but also to forge cooperation among its\r\nmembers in all areas. Today the OIC is an important\r\ninternational institution serving peace and security and\r\nworking for a better future for the Muslim community and\r\nhumanity as a whole.\r\nThe Muslim countries must now launch a concerted\r\neffort to play an active role in international affairs and the\r\nworld economy, as the Ummah cannot be a passive\r\nrecipient of globalization. What is required is nothing short\r\nof a mental revolution in the thinking of Muslim countries\r\nso that they can avoid becoming shut out by the pace of\r\nglobalization. In this regard, cooperation between the OIC\r\nand the United Nations is essential in order to ensure that\r\nthe Muslim community has an equitable share of the world\r\neconomy and of development.\r\nAs a member of the OIC and the Security Council, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the various joint initiatives and\r\nmissions that have been undertaken by the two\r\norganizations in Afghanistan in order to defuse tension and\r\nfacilitate peaceful settlements of disputes there. As regards\r\nTajikistan, the OIC continues to be a member of the\r\nContact Group that was established as part of the\r\nimplementation phase of the Tajik peace process. Somalia\r\ncontinues to be a major common concern for both the\r\nOIC and the United Nations. It is important for the\r\ninternational community to remain engaged with the\r\nproblem of Somalia and not allow it to continue to fester\r\nindefinitely. The efforts made by both organizations in the\r\nLockerbie case led to the suspension of the sanctions in\r\nLibya. We regret that this did not result in the final lifting\r\nof the sanctions, which we hope will be possible in the\r\nnear future.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the views expressed by\r\nthe OIC on the need to resolve expeditiously the current\r\ncrisis between Iraq and the United Nations so as to\r\nalleviate and end the plight of the long-suffering Iraqi\r\npeople. My delegation shares the concern of the OIC over\r\nthe fact that the indicted war criminals in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina continue to remain out of reach of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe reiterate our call for more robust efforts to deal with\r\nthese indicted war criminals, who are still at large. We\r\nhave to aim for consistency in our commitment and action\r\nin this regard. Inasmuch as we are making serious efforts\r\nto bring a terrorist to justice, through the passage recently\r\nof a Security Council resolution, we should not be seen\r\nto be less than serious in our determination in respect to\r\napprehending war criminals who have been indicted for\r\nwar crimes against humanity.\r\nBoth organizations have cooperated well at the\r\npolitical level in the peacemaking efforts in the conflicts\r\nin Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Somalia, as well as in the\r\npeace process in the Middle East and in promoting human\r\nrights. Other areas of cooperation include the development\r\nof science and technology, trade and development,\r\ntechnical cooperation among Islamic countries, assistance\r\nto refugees, food security and agriculture, education and\r\neradication of illiteracy, an investment mechanism and\r\njoint ventures, human-resources development, the\r\nenvironment, the development of arts and crafts and the\r\npromotion of heritage.\r\nNevertheless, even though the cooperation between\r\nthe OIC and the United Nations has always been close,\r\nthe majority of the OIC countries have not fully benefited\r\nfrom the fruits of this cooperation. Many of them still\r\nremain poor and underdeveloped. My delegation believes\r\nthat it is time for the two organizations to take stock of\r\nthe achievements and failures in order to map out new\r\nstrategies for future cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OIC. The cooperation at the Secretariat\r\nlevel of the two organizations should be reviewed to\r\nmake it more effective in responding to the challenges\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nahead. The new cooperation should be economic in focus\r\nand geared towards encouraging enhanced trade and\r\ninvestment flows among the OIC countries and in working\r\ntowards early reform of the international financial\r\narchitecture for the benefit of the whole international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMalaysia has always played an active role in the OIC.\r\nWe will continue to play a positive and constructive role in\r\nfostering better understanding, solidarity, cooperation and\r\nadvancement of member countries. Towards this end,\r\nMalaysia will be hosting the twenty-seventh session of OIC\r\nforeign ministers in Kuala Lumpur in June 2000 and we\r\nlook forward to the United Nations presence there.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to support the draft\r\nresolution on cooperation between the OIC and the United\r\nNations that was submitted by Ambassador Kafando, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Burkina Faso to the United\r\nNations, in his capacity as Chairman of the Islamic Group.\r\nMy delegation firmly believes that the United Nations\r\nis well placed to bridge the gap between the Islamic\r\ncountries and the rest of the international community\r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation. The Secretary-General\r\nhas acknowledged the positive role played by the OIC and\r\nhas long considered the OIC to be a vital partner of the\r\nUnited Nations throughout the Islamic world and beyond.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): I wish to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for the quality of his report and for\r\nthe thoughtfulness and work he put into it.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has\r\nmore than 50 member States, representing one fifth of the\r\nworld’s population throughout all the continents. This\r\nalmost universal representation confers upon the OIC duties\r\nand obligations on a world scale. Thus, it is only natural\r\nthat it should share the goals and principles, as well as the\r\nconcerns, of the United Nations. Hence, the importance\r\nwhich the States members of the OIC that are also\r\nMembers of the United Nations attach to cooperation\r\nbetween these two organizations within the framework of\r\na mutually beneficial partnership.\r\nThe political will to establish, strengthen and expand\r\nthat cooperation has allowed the creation of appropriate\r\nconsultation machinery for combining the efforts of the two\r\norganizations in the search for solutions to the crises facing\r\nthe Islamic Ummah. Among these crises, the question of\r\nPalestine, which was central to the creation of the OIC,\r\noccupies a special place. My country, Senegal, which holds\r\nthe chairmanship of the Committee on the Exercise of the\r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, can testify to\r\nthe vitality of relations between the United Nations and\r\nthe OIC on this question.\r\nIn the political realm, this cooperation extends to\r\nother conflict areas, including Afghanistan, Somalia,\r\nTajikistan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and, more\r\nrecently, Kosovo. Such conflicts are potential threats to\r\npeace and security in the regions concerned and have\r\nalways afforded opportunities to the two institutions to\r\nwork in close cooperation by working together to explore\r\nand implement ways and means of reducing tensions in\r\nthose parts of the world. Thus, in the Balkan crisis, the\r\nOIC countries worked side by side with the United\r\nNations to provide massive humanitarian assistance to\r\nrefugees and in the difficult task of building peace in and\r\nreconstructing Kosovo.\r\nPreventive diplomacy and the restoration and\r\nmaintenance of peace are not the sole areas of\r\ncooperation between the OIC and the United Nations.\r\nThis cooperation has increased significantly in recent\r\nyears to embrace such vast and important areas as\r\neconomic and social development, environment and\r\nrefugees — in a word, practically every area of activity\r\nof the institutions, programmes and funds of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nIt is in this framework that the two organizations\r\ncontinue to coordinate their activities in the context of the\r\n10 priority areas defined by the general meeting of the\r\nrepresentatives of the two secretariats and of the organs\r\nand agencies of the United Nations and the OIC, held in\r\nGeneva in July 1998. These priorities include trade,\r\nhuman resources development, the protection of the\r\nenvironment and the elimination of illiteracy and could\r\neven serve as models for the expansion of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OIC into other areas.\r\nIn this respect, I should like to stress — and take\r\npleasure in doing so — the perfect agreement between the\r\ntwo organizations with regard to the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, an idea that was put forward at the fifty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly by President\r\nKhatami of the Islamic Republic of Iran, current\r\nChairman of the OIC. Subsequently, the General\r\nAssembly adopted a resolution designating the year 2001\r\nthe United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nI am convinced that the two organizations will work\r\nclosely together in the year 2000 to raise that grand\r\ninitiative to its full significance.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nThe contemporary world is experiencing an era of\r\nserious and varied challenges that must be met with the\r\ndetermination and common will of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OIC is, indeed, one appropriate response to\r\nall these challenges. For all these reasons, my delegation\r\nsupports the consensus adoption of the draft resolution\r\nbefore us in document A/54/L.12, introduced so eloquently\r\nby the representative of Burkina Faso, speaking on behalf\r\nof the OIC.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): I wish to begin by commending\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and the current Chairman of\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Mr.\r\nSeyed Mohammad Khatami, President of Iran, for their\r\ncommitment to the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations and their work to extend it to new fields of\r\ncommon interest. We welcome the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nThe United Nations has, since the beginning, been one\r\nof the cornerstones of Norwegian foreign policy. As the\r\nproblems the international community confronts become\r\nmore complex, the importance of multilateral negotiations\r\nand agreements has increased. So has the role of regional\r\norganizations. Norway believes that these organizations\r\nconstitute important tools for promoting the principles of\r\nthe United Nations. We consider the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference a vital partner for the United Nations\r\nbecause of its broad regional influence. We also recognize\r\nthat the importance of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OIC reaches far beyond the Islamic world.\r\nNorway fully supports the cooperation between the\r\nOIC and the United Nations in their common search for\r\nsolutions to global problems related to international peace\r\nand security, disarmament, self-determination,\r\ndecolonization, fundamental human rights and economic,\r\nsocial and technical development. We welcome the\r\nincreasing efforts being made by the United Nations and the\r\nOIC to promote international peace and security. Noting the\r\npositive development in the Maghreb, we encourage the\r\ntwo organizations to continue strengthening cooperation in\r\nthe fields of peacemaking and preventive diplomacy. The\r\nperiodic high-level meetings between the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations and the Chairman of the OIC and the\r\nregular contact at the level of the Department of Political\r\nAffairs and the Permanent Observer Mission of the OIC to\r\nthe United Nations are important in this regard.\r\nWe particularly request the United Nations and the\r\nOIC to renew their efforts to find a negotiated solution to\r\nthe conflict in Afghanistan. The OIC is playing a crucial\r\nrole in this transnational conflict involving a number of\r\nIslamic countries. The missions to Afghanistan undertaken\r\njointly by the United Nations and the OIC are\r\ncommendable initiatives. Likewise, coordinated\r\npeacemaking efforts in connection with the conflict in\r\nTajikistan constitute an important contribution to the work\r\nfor peace and stability in the region.\r\nNorway also encourages cooperation between the\r\nOIC and the United Nations in countries such as Somalia\r\nand in the Balkans.\r\nCooperation between specialized agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations and the OIC and its subsidiary organs and\r\nspecialized and affiliated institutions serves to extend\r\ndialogue to new areas. We are pleased to note that\r\ninformation exchange and cooperation are taking place\r\nbetween the OIC and United Nations agencies such as the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,\r\nthe International Labour Organization and the World\r\nBank with a view to enhancing social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Memorandum of Understanding signed by the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund and the OIC on 2\r\nOctober 1998 constituted an important follow-up to the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nin Cairo. We welcome the steps taken towards further\r\nimplementation of the Cairo Programme of Action,\r\nespecially with regard to Islam and reproductive health,\r\nIslam and the status of women and Islam and population\r\nand development.\r\nNorway notes with appreciation that agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations such as the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization and the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are\r\nworking together in areas of common interest. We are\r\nalso aware that there is cooperation between the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nand the OIC, although this cooperation is not mentioned\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General. We encourage the\r\ndialogue in the human rights field.\r\nThe Islamic Commentaries on the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights are a valuable contribution\r\nto a mutual understanding of our joint commitment. Let\r\nme also take this opportunity not just to stress the\r\nimportance of freedom of religion and belief, but also to\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nhighlight the role that religious communities can play —\r\nincluding at the non-governmental level — in seeking\r\nsolutions to conflict. The Oslo Coalition, established in\r\naccordance with the mandate of the Oslo Conference on\r\nFreedom of Religion or Belief, is working with religious\r\nand confessional groups to pursue this agenda.\r\nLet me call attention to two further issues: women\u0027s\r\nrights and the right to education. As Norway stated at the\r\nCairo Conference, women\u0027s education is the single most\r\nimportant path to higher productivity and lower infant\r\nmortality. We are pleased to note that the education of girls\r\nand women is now included in the cooperation programmes\r\nbetween a large number of United Nations and OIC\r\ninstitutions and agencies.\r\nIn closing, Norway will again express its appreciation\r\nfor the commitment of the United Nations and the OIC to\r\ndevelop the cooperation between the two organizations. We\r\nhope that this working relationship will be developed\r\nfurther in the years to come.\r\nMr. Chaouachi (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is considering today the question of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), a matter that\r\nhas been considered by the Assembly periodically and on\r\nwhich resolutions are adopted annually for the promotion of\r\nsuch cooperation.\r\nCooperation between these two organizations means\r\ncoordination and consultation on all international issues,\r\nparticularly those that are of interest to today\u0027s Islamic\r\nworld, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter that\r\ncall for promoting cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations. This kind of cooperation is very\r\nimportant as it contributes effectively to the consolidation\r\nof the objectives and practices of the Charter in all fields.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference is an example of\r\nthe kind of cooperation that could be established between\r\nan international organization and a regional organization, as\r\nis evident in the Secretary-General\u0027s comprehensive report\r\n(A/54/308) on this question, for which we would like to\r\nthank him. During the past year, this cooperation has\r\nencompassed several areas, including political, social and\r\nhumanitarian ones. The two organizations coordinate and\r\nhold consultations with each other on a regular basis with\r\na view to finding solutions to issues related to international\r\npeace and security, to ending many crises and conflicts and\r\nto promoting cooperation and partnership in the economic,\r\nsocial and technical development fields.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOIC has extended to peacekeeping and preventive\r\ndiplomacy. The two organizations have consulted with\r\neach other on seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict\r\nin Afghanistan. We are pleased with this cooperation and\r\nurge that further cooperation of this kind prevail in\r\nseeking desired peaceful solutions. We also support all\r\nother forms of coordination and consultation efforts\r\nbetween these two organizations in all spheres of common\r\ninterest, including the Kosovo crisis.\r\nI wish to pay tribute to the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OIC in all spheres of economic,\r\nsocial and cultural activity. This cooperation has proved\r\nhow important it is and has been extended to areas of\r\ntrade, technical cooperation, food security, agriculture,\r\nhuman resources development and assistance to refugees,\r\namong other areas. In this connection, we call for greater\r\ntechnical assistance and other forms of support to be\r\ngiven by the United Nations to the OIC and its associate\r\ninstitutions, in order to continue such cooperation.\r\nTherefore, we support the draft resolution submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly on this item, contained in\r\ndocument A/54/L.12.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt)(spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, the Egyptian delegation would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC) and for the important information\r\ncontained in the report. Egypt attaches considerable\r\nimportance to promoting cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nEgypt welcomes the first follow-up meeting between\r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations, which was\r\nheld in December 1998 in the context of the follow-up\r\nwork to the high-level meeting with regional\r\norganizations held at United Nations Headquarters in July\r\nof the same year. We also welcome the participation of\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference in both\r\nmeetings. The first United Nations follow-up meeting\r\nwith regional organizations focused on conflict\r\nprevention, marking an important step towards stepped-up\r\nimplementation of Chapter VIII of the Charter, which\r\nclearly delineates the relationship between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, particularly in the\r\nfield of international peace and security.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nEgypt is particularly pleased with the follow-up to\r\nconsultations between the United Nations and the OIC on\r\npolitical questions, particularly those related to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and re-establishment of\r\npeace, by way of meetings between the two secretaries-\r\ngeneral of the two organizations or through regular\r\nconsultations between high officials on political issues.\r\nSuch consultations are an important tool for conveying the\r\nconcerns of member States of the OIC, whose membership\r\nis almost one third of the United Nations membership,\r\nabout issues of common interest for the two organizations,\r\nso as to make a real contribution to international efforts\r\ndesigned to find just, comprehensive and balanced answers\r\nto these concerns.\r\nWe would like to give some examples, though this is\r\nnot an exhaustive list. We have the questions of Palestine,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan and many\r\nothers related to international peace and security, areas\r\nwhich need concerted efforts on the part of the international\r\ncommunity in order to find just political solutions for them.\r\nConflict prevention was at the heart of the first follow-\r\nup meeting between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations. Maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity is a principal dimension of this question. Economic\r\nand social development is another dimension growing in\r\nimportance at the international level. Therefore, Egypt\r\nwelcomes the cooperation between the United Nations\r\ninstitutions and agencies that deal with such questions and\r\nthe relevant institutions of the OIC, which can be seen from\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General. We hope that this form\r\nof cooperation will be reflected in an increased number of\r\nspecific concrete projects in which entities from both\r\norganizations will participate. We also hope that such\r\ncooperation will extend to other areas, such as the transfer\r\nof technologies to States of the Islamic world and the\r\nenhancement of their national capabilities in this vital field,\r\nas well as the facilitation of cooperation between those\r\ncountries, especially as we approach the eve of a new\r\ncentury. We hope that all this can be done with support and\r\ncooperation by United Nations institutions and agencies for\r\nthe OIC special commission on this issue.\r\nAmong the main areas of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OIC, to which our delegation\r\nattaches special importance, is cooperation in the cultural\r\nfield. The importance of such cooperation is increasing in\r\na world where we currently see repetitions of certain\r\ndoctrines such as clashes of civilizations. Such doctrines\r\nignore the positive historical interaction between different\r\ncivilizations, as well as the cumulative contributions by\r\nvarious civilizations to the development of the history of\r\nhumankind. This clearly includes Islamic civilization and\r\nits cultural, scientific and humanistic contributions that\r\ncertainly cannot be denied.\r\nEgypt welcomes the existing cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization and the Islamic Conference in the spheres of\r\neducation, science and culture and hopes that it will be\r\nfurther strengthened in the form of more international\r\nseminars held jointly so that the world may be acquainted\r\nwith the contributions of Islamic civilization to the history\r\nof humankind.\r\nAs regards aspects of cooperation between various\r\nUnited Nations organs and bodies and the OIC, I pay\r\ntribute to the cooperation of these two organizations in\r\nthe humanitarian field through coordination with the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees and the OIC, and also through the support given\r\nby the OIC and its States to the efforts of the United\r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\r\nin the Near East for the provision of basic services and\r\nhumanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees.\r\nThe Egyptian delegation looks forward to the general\r\nmeeting of the representatives of the two secretariats of\r\nthe United Nations system and of the OIC next year as an\r\nopportunity for a comprehensive review of development\r\nand promotion of the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations on the eve of the twenty-first century. In\r\nthis context, my delegation would like to appeal to the\r\nhost country, the United States of America, to consider\r\npositively the question of dealing with the two permanent\r\nobserver missions of the OIC and the League of Arab\r\nStates in New York, that they be treated on an equal\r\nfooting with the other missions with observer status. As\r\nsuch, these two missions will be able to shoulder their\r\nresponsibilities in the area of promotion of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the various regional\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n3369 (XXX) of 10 October 1975, I now call on the\r\nObserver for the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nMr. Lamani (Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, on behalf of\r\nthe Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nConference (OIC) and on my own behalf, I should like to\r\nextend our sincere congratulations to Mr. Gurirab on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fourth session. We are confident that his wide\r\nexperience and diplomatic skills are the best guarantee that\r\nthe work of the Assembly will be conducted effectively and\r\ndecisively.\r\nI should also like to express our profound appreciation\r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his remarkable\r\nsuccess in steering the work of the fifty-third session.\r\nAs we consider agenda item 29, entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference”, I am honoured to review some of the\r\ndevelopments that have taken place in the political,\r\neconomic, social and humanitarian fields during the period\r\nunder review.\r\nThe United Nations and the OIC share a commitment\r\nto intensify cooperation and coordination between them and\r\nto seek solutions to issues of common concern, such as\r\npeace, security, disarmament, self-determination, basic\r\nhuman rights, economic and social development and\r\ntechnical cooperation.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General now before the\r\nAssembly, contained in document A/54/308, highlights this\r\ncooperation. In this regard, I should like to express our\r\ndeep appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his wise leadership of the international\r\nOrganization and his effective role in the realization of its\r\ngoals.\r\nI should also like to express our appreciation to the\r\nexecutive heads of the various United Nations funds,\r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies for their laudable\r\nefforts to enhance cooperation between the two\r\norganizations for the effective implementation of joint\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn affirmation of the growing needs and common\r\nrequirements of the member States of the OIC, General\r\nAssembly resolution 53/16 of 29 October 1998 called for\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation between our two\r\norganizations in the political, social, economic and\r\nhumanitarian fields, a detailed review of which is contained\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThese issues were also reviewed at the annual meeting\r\nof the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the\r\nOIC, which was held at United Nations Headquarters on 1\r\nOctober 1999. Moreover, consultations continued between\r\nthe Secretaries-General of the two organizations with\r\nregard to other important and urgent issues of common\r\nconcern, including the question of Palestine, the situation\r\nin the Middle East, Somalia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and\r\nother matters.\r\nWe look forward to the general meeting between\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretariat of the United Nations\r\nsystem and the OIC, as well as the coordination meetings\r\nbetween the organizations and agencies of the United\r\nNations system and the OIC and its subsidiary organs and\r\nother specialized institutions, which are scheduled to take\r\nplace in 2000 in Geneva. In those meetings, cooperation\r\nand joint activities will be reviewed, and future plans and\r\nproposals to enhance and strengthen the mechanisms for\r\ncooperation between the two organizations will be\r\ndiscussed.\r\nI should also like to reiterate the concern and interest\r\nof the OIC in the matter of the reform of the United\r\nNations and of the Security Council, since the OIC\r\nmember States have a direct and vital stake in\r\ndetermining the outcome of these reforms. This was\r\naffirmed by the most recent annual coordinating meeting\r\nof the Foreign Ministers of member States of the OIC,\r\nheld at United Nations Headquarters in New York on 1\r\nOctober 1999.\r\nTurning from the political sphere to the fields of\r\neconomic and social development, I should like to refer\r\nto the report of the Secretary-General, which illustrates\r\nthe continued progress in the areas of technology, trade,\r\ndevelopment and technical cooperation among the\r\nmember States of the OIC, as well as in assistance to\r\nrefugees, food security, agriculture, education, fighting\r\nilliteracy, investment mechanisms, development of human\r\nresources and the environment.\r\nIn this regard, I am pleased to inform the Assembly\r\nthat a memorandum of understanding between the OIC\r\nand the United Nations Population Fund was signed in\r\n1998 to enhance cooperation in the fields of family and\r\nsocial education, population census, reproductive health\r\nand related questions.\r\nThis month, another memorandum of understanding\r\nbetween the OIC and the World Food Programme will be\r\nsigned to promote cooperation and coordination of\r\nactivities in areas of common interest.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nWe are currently conducting negotiations with the\r\nUnited Nations in order to find ways of establishing close\r\ncooperation in the area of protecting children during armed\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe Permanent Representative of Burkina Faso, in his\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Islamic Group, has just\r\nintroduced a draft resolution on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OIC, which is before the Assembly\r\nin document A/54/L.12 of 21 October 1999. I should like\r\nto draw attention to two important paragraphs in the\r\noperative part.\r\nParagraph 3 requests the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference to continue to\r\ncooperate in their common search for solutions to global\r\nproblems, such as questions relating to international peace\r\nand security, disarmament, self-determination,\r\ndecolonization, fundamental human rights, social and\r\neconomic development and technical cooperation.\r\nUndoubtedly, this paragraph reaffirms the will of the United\r\nNations to involve the OIC in diplomatic and mediation\r\nefforts to find solutions to problems of common concern.\r\nSecondly, paragraph 11 urges the United Nations and\r\nother organizations of the United Nations system, especially\r\nthe lead agencies, to provide increased technical and other\r\nforms of assistance to the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and\r\naffiliated institutions in order to enhance cooperation. We\r\nwould welcome such support, as it would strengthen and\r\nenhance the capacity of our organization and make its\r\ncontribution to the joint programmes and activities of the\r\nUnited Nations more effective.\r\nAllow me once more to raise an issue that I had raised\r\nin the Assembly during its fifty-third session. However, it\r\nis my hope that raising it again might enable us to achieve\r\nthe desired objective. The issue concerns the facilities and\r\nprivileges granted to Missions to the United Nations in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Headquarters\r\nAgreement. It is well known that, unlike some other\r\nregional organizations, the Permanent Observer Mission of\r\nthe OIC does not fully enjoy these facilities and privileges.\r\nAs we raise this issue once again, we hope that those\r\nresponsible for the implementation of the Headquarters\r\nAgreement will give it serious consideration and the\r\nimportance it deserves so that we can discharge our tasks\r\nand responsibilities fully and more effectively.\r\nI hope the draft resolution before the Assembly will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm the ongoing interest\r\nof the OIC in the continuation of cooperation and\r\ncoordination with the United Nations and its full\r\ncommitment to the provisions of the Charter and to the\r\nrealization of its noble purposes.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take\r\na decision on draft resolution A/54/L.12.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.12?\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.12 was adopted (resolution\r\n54/7).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 29?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 32\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/420)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.13)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative\r\nof Peru to introduce draft resolution A/54/L.13.\r\nMr. Picasso (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): As in\r\nprevious years, the delegation of Peru would like to\r\nintroduce a draft resolution under agenda item 32 on the\r\nbasis of the implementation of General Assembly\r\nresolution 52/3 — referred to in the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport of 23 September 1998 (A/53/420) — entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System”. This draft resolution has\r\nbeen circulated as document A/54/L.13.\r\nAs will be recalled, ever since this item was\r\nintroduced into the agenda of the General Assembly in\r\n1987, its consideration has made it possible for Member\r\nStates of the Latin America and the Caribbean to give\r\nadequate articulation to their national priorities through\r\nthe Latin American Economic System (SELA). This\r\narticulation has greater relevance in the present context of\r\nglobalization, a phenomenon in which the various national\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nactors of each of our countries need a fruitful exchange of\r\ntheir experiences in their gradual inclusion.\r\nIn this connection, it falls on SELA — a body that has\r\nexisted for over 27 years — to bring about greater\r\ncooperation in support of economic and social development\r\nin the region through a mechanism that is flexible and\r\nprovides for periodic consultations. In 1996, the Latin\r\nAmerican Council, the ministerial organ of SELA, adopted\r\na dynamic programme of modernization and restructuring\r\nof the organization that consisted mainly of reorienting its\r\nprogramme of work and updating its functioning. This\r\nsmooth exchange of experiences has been possible thanks\r\nto the participation of specialized agencies, United Nations\r\nprogrammes and other organizations.\r\nIn 1996, 1997 and early in 1998, SELA developed\r\nprogrammes for technical cooperation between developing\r\ncountries in the fields of decentralization and support to\r\nsmall and medium-sized businesses.\r\nPeru hopes that, as in earlier years, this draft\r\nresolution will once again have the consensus support of the\r\nMember States of the United Nations, thereby reflecting the\r\nspirit of contribution to the efforts that each region is\r\npromoting in seeking to achieve that development is also a\r\nparticipatory and comprehensive process.\r\nMr. Kerpens (Suriname): I have the honour to\r\naddress the Assembly in this debate on agenda item 32 on\r\nbehalf of the 14 member States of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM).\r\nAllow me at the outset to express the appreciation of\r\nCARICOM to the representative of Peru for introducing\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.13, entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem” I would like to commend it for unanimous\r\nadoption by the General Assembly.\r\nLikewise, CARICOM member States take pride in\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his informative report\r\ncontained in document A/53/420, outlining the various\r\nactivities in the area of cooperation between the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System (SELA) and the United\r\nNations system, in particular with the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean\r\n(ECLAC), the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP); the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and the World Intellectual\r\nProperty Organization (WIPO). Those activities can be\r\ncharacterized as considerable and diversified.\r\nOur present era is characterized by an increased\r\nglobalization of markets. The ensuing concentration of\r\npower and influence lies in the hands of those nations,\r\ninstitutions and individuals that can master the wealth of\r\ninformation on all aspects of human interaction, be it\r\neconomic, financial, political, social or cultural. It\r\nharbours, at the same time, the danger of marginalizing\r\nthose that cannot adapt successfully to these changes.\r\nRegional institutions like SELA can play an\r\nindispensable role in assisting countries, in particular\r\nsmall and vulnerable ones such as CARICOM member\r\nStates, to make the adaptation process less costly, less\r\npainful and speedy by analysing trends of the ongoing\r\nglobalization process, recommending policy options and\r\npromoting efforts towards further integration among the\r\ncountries of Latin America and the Caribbean, between\r\nthe subregions in our hemisphere and between our region\r\nand other regions. Through these activities, SELA has\r\ncontributed to the integration of its member States into\r\nthe global economy and to the growing, mutually\r\nbeneficial, interdependent relations that exist between the\r\ndifferent subregions of Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nThe member States of CARICOM were therefore\r\nvery saddened by the tragic event that took place in\r\nFebruary 1998, which resulted in the destruction of the\r\npremises of the Permanent Secretariat in Caracas. This\r\nhas been a setback in our institutional capacity to deal\r\nwith the twin processes of adaptation to fundamental\r\nchanges at the global level and our efforts to strengthen\r\nthe process of integration, both within our region and\r\nbetween our region and other regions.\r\nThis tragic event has forced the member States to\r\nfocus their attention not only on restoring the valuable\r\nassets of the organization, but also on addressing its\r\ninstitutional vulnerability and inefficiency and on defining\r\nways to improve the difficult financial situation of SELA.\r\nThrough the decisions adopted at the seventh and eighth\r\nspecial Council meetings and at the twenty-fourth\r\nordinary Council meeting, they have initiated a process of\r\nrestructuring and modernization that should eventually\r\nequip SELA with the tools to continue to respond in a\r\npositive manner to the demands of the countries of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean.\r\nFollowing these changes, SELA will concentrate its\r\nfuture activities on three thematic areas: extra-regional\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\nrelations, intra-regional relations and regional cooperation.\r\nIts work programme, its budget and its human resources\r\nmanagement will undergo the necessary changes and\r\nadaptations in order to be in a position to fulfil its mandate\r\naccording to these strategic thematic areas. Enhanced\r\ncooperation between SELA and the United Nations in these\r\nareas will be beneficial to the United Nations system and to\r\nall countries belonging to the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean family.\r\nTo place the financial situation of the organization on\r\na sound basis, the member States of SELA have adopted\r\nthe Payment Incentive Programme in order to make\r\navailable the necessary means for the implementation of its\r\nwork programme. CARICOM member States pledge their\r\nsupport for these important initiatives and appeal to donor\r\ncountries and the United Nations system, in particular to the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, to continue to\r\ncontribute to the funding of the work programme and,\r\nwhere possible, to increase their valuable contributions.\r\nThe Latin American and Caribbean Economic System\r\nremains for CARICOM a valuable instrument in providing\r\ninformation on how to deal with one of the most crucial\r\nissues related to development, namely, how to finance\r\ndevelopment. It is therefore commendable that the twenty-\r\nfifth Council meeting, which will be held from 26 to 28\r\nOctober 1999, has chosen as its central theme “Options for\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean vis-à-vis the international\r\nfinancial crisis”. That crisis has been a source of concern\r\nfor CARICOM countries, considering that they too are\r\nconfronted with obstacles in attracting financial resources\r\nfor their development.\r\nBased on its experience in this matter, SELA could\r\nplay a role in helping to define the way the United Nations\r\nshould deal with the pending issues related to the convening\r\nof an international conference on money and finance, which\r\nwill be discussed later, when the Second Committee\r\nresumes the debate on these issues during the fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nAs we witness the closing of the century and the\r\ndawning of a new millennium, much attention is rightfully\r\nfocused on our truly universal Organization, the United\r\nNations, to guide us on the path where we will confront the\r\nchallenges facing humanity.\r\nHow to define human security and how to achieve the\r\ngoals derived from our concept of what dignifies humanity\r\nwill probably depend on the extent to which we will be\r\nable to make the United Nations an effective instrument\r\nto assist us in this endeavour.\r\nIn our region, we must take a closer look at regional\r\norganizations in order to be able to contribute from our\r\nown regional perspective to the achievement of these\r\nobjectives. Cooperation and mutual assistance between\r\nSELA and the United Nations will not only be logical but\r\nwill undoubtedly make our task a little easier.\r\nCARICOM therefore envisions greater cooperation\r\nbetween SELA and the United Nations as a way to\r\ncombine the efforts of the region with those of the\r\ninternational system to achieve greater cooperation and\r\ncoherence in our common struggle for the good of the\r\npeoples we represent, and we look forward to a deepening\r\nof the existing relations between our two institutions.\r\nIn conclusion, the CARICOM member States\r\nreiterate their support for the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem, but likewise they are looking forward to\r\nconcerted actions by that institution to assist them in their\r\nefforts to integrate effectively into the global economy.\r\nMr. Bivero (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nVenezuela, as a country that has the privilege of serving\r\nas headquarters for the Latin American Economic System\r\n(SELA), would like to reiterate its appreciation for the\r\nefforts made by the United Nations, through the\r\nspecialized agencies of the system, to strengthen the\r\ncooperation and coordination of the Latin American\r\nEconomic System in areas of priority interest for the\r\ndevelopment of our region.\r\nThis cooperation is becoming increasingly important\r\nat a time when the world Organization and the regional\r\nand subregional organizations are beginning to deal with\r\nthe phenomenon of globalization and are assessing its\r\nimpact on economic and social development. As pointed\r\nout by the delegation of Suriname, in the next few days,\r\non Tuesday and Wednesday, we will be holding in\r\nCaracas the twenty-fifth regular meeting of the Latin\r\nAmerican Council of SELA, whose main topic will be the\r\noptions of Latin America and the Caribbean vis-à-vis the\r\ninternational financial crisis. The Permanent Secretariat\r\nhas had the support of United Nations bodies in preparing\r\nfor the debate on this issue.\r\nIn the framework of that cooperation with the United\r\nNations, we are pleased to note, inter alia, the\r\ncontinuation of the Agreement between the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 October 1999\r\n(UNESCO) and SELA on “Communication for the\r\nIntegration of Latin America and the Caribbean”; the\r\nparticipation of SELA in the fourteenth regional meeting of\r\nthe International Labour Organization; and the contribution\r\nmade by Economic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean to the high-level regional meeting entitled\r\n“Towards a stable and predictable international financial\r\nsystem and its relationship to social development”,\r\nconvened by the Government of Mexico and in which\r\nSELA also participated. Venezuela deems it important that\r\nthese efforts continue and multiply so that they may\r\ncontribute to the economic and social development of the\r\nregion.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations system, it is\r\nparticularly important for the member States of SELA to\r\nensure that the United Nations Development Programme\r\ncontinues to provide financial and technical support to\r\nprogrammes carried out by the Permanent Secretariat with\r\na view to complementing the cooperation and technical-\r\nassistance activities of SELA in the region.\r\nVenezuela is pleased to co-sponsor the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/54/L.13, which is before the\r\nAssembly and was introduced by the delegation of Peru,\r\nand we trust that it will be adopted by consensus in this\r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to announce that,\r\nsince the introduction of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have become co-sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/54/L.13: Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador,\r\nGuyana, Haiti and Nicaragua.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.13.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.13?\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.13 was adopted (resolution\r\n54/8).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Finland, who wishes to make a statement\r\nin explanation of vote.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Silvennoinen (Finland): I have the honour to\r\ntake the floor in order to explain the position of the\r\nEuropean Union (EU). The EU joined the consensus on\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.13 on the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem, but at the same time would like to put on record\r\nthe following observations.\r\nRegarding operative paragraphs 3 and 4, we note\r\nthat the resolution urges the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the specialized agencies and other\r\norganizations, funds and programmes of the United\r\nNations system to renew their contribution and to\r\nintensify their support for, and cooperation with, the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System. It is the understanding of\r\nthe European Union that decisions and agreements on\r\nsuch activities should be made by the Executive Board of\r\nUNDP and in the governing bodies of the respective\r\nspecialized agencies, other organizations, funds and\r\nprogrammes, in accordance with their respective agreed\r\npriorities and budget.\r\nWe support the request expressed in operative\r\nparagraph 5 that a review should be done at an\r\nappropriate time to assess the implementation of the\r\nagreement between the United Nations and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System, also with a view to\r\nevaluating its expediency.\r\nThe European Union would like to place on record\r\nits concern that for the second successive time, Member\r\nStates have not been afforded sufficient opportunity to\r\ninformally consult one another on this resolution, and it\r\nrequests that, in the interests of transparency and the\r\nsmooth running of the General Assembly, Member States\r\nbe given such an opportunity in the future by the early\r\ndistribution of drafts in advance of their consideration at\r\nthe plenary.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote. May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 32?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m.\r\n18\r\n"
