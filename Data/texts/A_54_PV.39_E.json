(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Morel\r\n(Seychelles), Vice-President, took the Chair\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 13\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice (A/54/4)\r\nThe Acting President: The report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice contained in document A/54/4 covers the\r\nperiod l August 1998 to 31 July 1999. May I take it that\r\nthe General Assembly takes note of the report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Mr. Stephen\r\nSchwebel, President of the International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Schwebel (President of the International Court of\r\nJustice): I am pleased to see the Vice-President of the Court\r\nand other colleagues of mine present in the Assembly.\r\nIt is an honour to speak to the General Assembly\r\nunder the presidency of the Foreign Minister of Namibia,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab. The work of the International Court\r\nof Justice has been intertwined with the destiny of Namibia,\r\nin which he has played so prominent a part.\r\nIt has been said that where one stands depends on\r\nwhere one sits. The judges of the International Court of\r\nJustice sit in the favoured city of The Hague as members\r\nof the world\u0027s most senior international court, the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, the Court\r\nwith the richest history, the broadest material jurisdiction,\r\nthe most refined jurisdictional jurisprudence; they sit in a\r\nWorld Court which since 1922 has issued scores of\r\njudgments that have successfully settled international\r\ndisputes and contributed to the shaping and reshaping of\r\ninternational law.\r\nFrom the judicial perspective of The Hague, the\r\ncentury that is about to close is a century of great\r\nachievement and profound loss, of extraordinary scientific\r\nand technological advance and of atavistic reversion to\r\nbarbarism. With the horrors of two world wars and too\r\nmany other wars; the organized bestialities of the\r\nHolocaust, whose obsessive scale gave rise to the General\r\nAssembly\u0027s interdiction of the crime of genocide; the\r\npurposeful and pervasive atrocities of Cambodia, Rwanda,\r\nBosnia, Kosovo and Sierra Leone, among others, some\r\neven more recent or continuing — this century is as\r\nmarked by its invention of the concentration camp and the\r\nrefugee camp as it is by its invention of the airplane and\r\nof the exploration of space. Man\u0027s knowledge has\r\nimproved exponentially but his character has not; human\r\nnature seems less promising than it may have been\r\nthought to be in 1899. Certainly the need to regulate\r\nhuman — and inhuman — behaviour looks no less\r\npressing today than it did in 1899, when the first Hague\r\nPeace Conference took up the now familiar subjects of\r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes,\r\ndisarmament and the law of war. The twentieth century\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nhas witnessed appalling acts of aggression and regression,\r\nyet it has seen unparalleled advances in international law\r\nand institutions as well.\r\nIt is remarkable to recall that the first worldwide\r\ndiplomatic conferences in the history of mankind were as\r\nrecent as the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907.\r\nThere had been earlier multilateral conferences to end wars\r\nand share out spheres of influence. But the Hague\r\nConferences were the first beginnings of international\r\ndiplomacy that gave rise to the formation of international\r\norganization and the concerted promotion of international\r\nlaw. It is fitting that the Hague Conference of 1899 was\r\nsearchingly commemorated this year in The Hague and that\r\nit was addressed with his characteristic insight by the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nAs early as 1907, at the second Hague Peace\r\nConference, the creation of a permanent court of\r\ninternational justice was proposed. That proposal was not\r\nadopted, notably because agreement could not be reached\r\non how to choose the judges. Such concerns were\r\nsubmerged by the outbreak of the First World War and the\r\nextraordinary extent of the death and destruction that its\r\nprolongation entailed.\r\nBut the catastrophe of the First World War led to the\r\ngreat experiment of the League of Nations, the construction\r\nof an institutional framework of legal principle and process\r\ndesigned to maintain and promote international peace and\r\nsecurity. The League of Nations Covenant provided for the\r\nestablishment of the Permanent Court of International\r\nJustice, and its organs provided the means for electing its\r\nmembers. That Court, the immediate predecessor of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, was set up in 1922 and\r\nfunctioned until 1940. It functioned well. It demonstrated\r\nthat a world court could work and that international law\r\ncould be made more effective through judicial\r\ndetermination. The Court successfully adjudicated disputes\r\nbetween States, and its judgments and advisory opinions\r\nmade major contributions to the development of\r\ninternational law. It opened the gateway to the creation of\r\na modern law of human rights by holding that treaties may\r\nestablish rights and obligations for individuals which are\r\nenforceable under international law.\r\nThe League of Nations, for reasons beyond its control,\r\nwas unable to contain the assault of the Axis Powers on\r\npeace and civilization — nor, of course, could the Court.\r\nWith the defeat of the Axis Powers, the will to “save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war” led to the\r\ncreation of the United Nations, a sharply reformed League.\r\nBut the Court, unlike the League, was not sharply\r\nreformed. It was maintained almost intact because\r\nstatesmen and scholars alike saw it as a success within its\r\nown sphere.\r\nThe few innovations introduced into the Statute at\r\nSan Francisco were positive. The new Court became the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, and all\r\nUnited Nations Members became party to the Court’s\r\nStatute, which forms an integral part of the Charter.\r\nNo international court in an international society as\r\ndecentralized as international society was and is could\r\nprevent war. As has been rightly observed, more often\r\nthan not it is not disputes as to rights which cause wars,\r\nbut rather conflicts of interests, which is quite a different\r\nmatter. Yet a world court can fundamentally foster peace\r\nthrough the adjudicated settlement of international\r\ndisputes and the development of the body of international\r\nlaw.\r\nToday, 53 years after its creation, the International\r\nCourt of Justice has more than justified that perception.\r\nAs the annual report of the Court transmitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly recounts, in the period from 1 August\r\n1998 to 31 July 1999 the Court rendered two judgments\r\nand one advisory opinion. It issued orders on requests for\r\nprovisional measures in another 11 cases. It admitted\r\ncounter-claims in another case, and it issued orders\r\nconcerning the conduct of proceedings in 19 cases in all.\r\nThose cases concern international disputes both large and\r\nsmall. The issues raised are diverse and significant. The\r\nparties are as diverse as the issues.\r\nWhat is especially arresting is that during this period\r\nthe Court was seized of 18 new contentious cases, far\r\nmore than have ever been filed within any 12-month\r\nperiod before. Ten of those cases, brought by Yugoslavia\r\nagainst 10 members of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) in respect of the Kosovo bombing,\r\nhave marked commonalities. But even so, the extent of\r\nincreased recourse to the Court is remarkable, and it is\r\ncontinuing. Pakistan filed an application against India last\r\nmonth in respect of the shooting down of a Pakistani\r\nnaval aircraft. Chile has informed the Court of, and\r\npublicly announced, an intention to bring to the Court the\r\nPinochet case against Spain.\r\nThis extended recourse is all the more noteworthy\r\nwhen the diversity of States submitting cases to the Court\r\nis considered. Parties to the statute of the Permanent\r\nCourt of International Justice were restricted by the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nprevalence of colonial rule and the policies of the United\r\nStates of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics. Perforce, the Permanent Court of International\r\nJustice was Euro-centred. The International Court of Justice\r\ntoday is universal in its clientele. States submitting cases to\r\nthe Court are drawn not only from Europe and the\r\nAmericas, but from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and\r\nAustralasia. Indeed, today States of Africa are in the lead\r\nin their resort to the Court. The Court itself is universal in\r\nits composition, made up as it is of members from the\r\nUnited States of America, Sri Lanka, Japan, Algeria,\r\nFrance, Madagascar, Hungary, China, Germany, Sierra\r\nLeone, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom,\r\nVenezuela, the Netherlands and Brazil.\r\nThe extent of recourse to the Court is immensely\r\nencouraging. It is to be hoped that this will in turn promote\r\nwider adherence to the compulsory jurisdiction of the\r\nCourt. Before the end of the cold war, the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Court was a perennial subject of jousting in the Sixth\r\nCommittee between East and West. A regular feature of\r\ncodification conferences called by the United Nations was\r\nbattles over whether the Court should be endowed with the\r\njurisdiction to adjudicate disputes that might arise under the\r\ntreaties concluded by those conferences. In view of the\r\npositive evolution of international relations, those battles\r\nshould be a thing of the past. There is no reason why the\r\njurisdiction of the Court should not be regularly provided\r\nfor.\r\nIt is to be equally hoped that the number of States\r\nadhering to the jurisdiction of the Court under the optional\r\nclause will grow at a greater rate. Sixty-two States currently\r\nadhere, only a third of the number of parties to the Statute\r\nand a number that does not include many of the larger\r\nStates. A higher proportion of States adhered to the optional\r\nclause of the Statute of the Permanent Court in 1939 than\r\nis the comparable case today.\r\nNot only is the Court far busier than ever before, not\r\nonly is the diversity of States using the Court far greater,\r\nbut the range of issues raised before the Court increasingly\r\nincludes questions related to major international crises. In\r\nthe 12 months under review, cases concerning hostilities in\r\nKosovo and the Congo were brought to the Court, joining\r\non the docket such sensitive cases as those concerning the\r\nLockerbie atrocity and claims of genocide on the territory\r\nof the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe Court’s General List also includes four cases of\r\nboundary delimitation, a more traditional area in which the\r\nCourt has been notably successful. A few of those boundary\r\ncases are of very great importance to the States\r\nconcerned. The boundary dispute on which the Court will\r\nannounce a judgment in some weeks concerns the river\r\nboundary between Botswana and Namibia and a small\r\nisland in the boundary river. But the example set by\r\nBotswana and Namibia — of litigating rather than\r\nfighting over a bit of land — is one that other States,\r\nincluding other African States, could usefully emulate.\r\nIn the past year, resort to requests for the indication\r\nof provisional measures stands out. Such requests take\r\nprecedence over all other judicial business. They may\r\nstrain the members of the Court and its Registry. In the\r\nLaGrand case, brought by Germany against the United\r\nStates, the Court agreed unanimously on an indication of\r\nprovisional measures within 24 hours of receipt of the\r\napplication. In the 10 applications filed by Yugoslavia\r\nagainst members of NATO, the Court acted rapidly.\r\nWhen provisional measures are sought, the Court\r\ndeals with them while other cases are in progress. That\r\nillustrates a broader trend in the Court — to deal with\r\nmore than one case at a time, rather than taking up cases\r\nsuccessively, a trend which, however, is constrained by\r\nthe extent of the Court’s resources. The Registry, and the\r\nbudget of the Court, essentially were designed for an era\r\nwhen the Court had few, not many, cases on its docket.\r\nThe entry of actors onto the international stage other\r\nthan States which also influence the processes of\r\ninternational law-making and administration has, among\r\nother factors, fostered the creation of specialized\r\ninternational tribunals. This development is to be\r\nwelcomed. It makes international law more effective by\r\nendowing legal obligations with the means of their\r\ndetermination and enforcement. Concern that the\r\nproliferation of international tribunals might produce\r\nsubstantial conflict among them, and evisceration of the\r\ndocket of the International Court of Justice, have not\r\nmaterialized, at any rate as yet. A greater range of\r\ninternational legal forums is likely to mean that more\r\ndisputes are submitted to international judicial settlement.\r\nThe more international adjudication there is, the more\r\nthere is likely to be; the “judicial habit” may stimulate\r\nhealthy imitation.\r\nAt the same time, in order to minimize such\r\npossibility as may occur of significant conflicting\r\ninterpretations of international law, there might be virtue\r\nin enabling other international tribunals to request\r\nadvisory opinions of the International Court of Justice on\r\nissues of international law that arise in cases before those\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\ntribunals that are of importance to the unity of international\r\nlaw.\r\nIn respect of international tribunals that are organs of\r\nthe United Nations, such as the international tribunals for\r\nthe prosecution of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and\r\nRwanda, no jurisdictional problem in their requesting the\r\nSecurity Council to request advisory opinions on their\r\nbehalf appears, should they wish to do so. The Council is\r\nauthorized by the Charter to request the Court to give an\r\nadvisory opinion on any legal question, and nothing in the\r\nStatutes of the war crimes tribunals debars them from\r\nasking the Security Council to exercise that authority on\r\ntheir behalf. Nor do the administrative tribunals of the\r\nUnited Nations system lack the competence to request the\r\nGeneral Assembly or comparable organs of the specialized\r\nagencies to request opinions on their behalf.\r\nThere is even room for the argument that international\r\ntribunals that are not United Nations organs, such as the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, or the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, when established, might, if\r\nthey so decide, request the General Assembly — perhaps\r\nthrough the medium of a special committee established for\r\nthe purpose — to request advisory opinions of the Court. It\r\nshould be recalled that the League of Nations Council asked\r\nadvisory opinions not only on behalf of the League, but,\r\nmore often, of other international agencies and States. The\r\nLeague Covenant did not expressly authorize the Council or\r\nthe Assembly of the League to request advisory opinions on\r\nbehalf of others. Nor did the constitutions of such others\r\nexpressly authorize them to ask the League to request\r\nadvisory opinions. Do the General Assembly and Security\r\nCouncil lack comparable capacity to serve as channels for\r\nrequests of international tribunals?\r\nIn any event, a certain caution in the creation of new\r\nuniversal courts may be merited in respect of inter-State\r\ndisputes. The International Court of Justice has\r\ndemonstrated a capacity to deal with specialized and new,\r\nas well as broader and more traditional, problems.\r\nAt the same time, the Court will have to respond to\r\nthe new challenge of cases coming in more rapidly than\r\njudgments are going out. Building on its recent review of\r\nits work methods, it has now embarked on a revision of its\r\nrules and practice, with a view to accelerating its own\r\nprocesses and inducing States parties to join in so doing.\r\nThe drawing out of Court proceedings by States, by using\r\nthe maximum number of written and oral exchanges and by\r\nrequiring excessive lengths of time for the preparation of\r\npleadings, slows the Court\u0027s work, as does resort to\r\npreliminary objections, which is at times well founded but\r\nat other times is apparently tactical. A tendency towards\r\nattaching unduly extensive annexes to pleadings requires\r\ncurbing, because all annexes must be translated, as must\r\nbe the pleadings themselves — processes which are time-\r\nconsuming and expensive. The permanent translation staff\r\nof the Court is tiny.\r\nUnder the chairmanship of Ambassador Mselle, the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions (ACABQ), whose current report on the Court\u0027s\r\nadministration and budget is most positive and\r\nappreciated — as was its report of 1998 on the Court\u0027s\r\nconditions of service — has accepted the modest\r\nexpansion in translation staff requested by the Court for\r\nthe next biennium. The Court trusts that the Fifth\r\nCommittee will authorize this, as it authorized last year\u0027s\r\nimprovement in conditions of service. But if the Court is\r\nto have the capacity and flexibility to translate pleadings\r\nin ways which enable it to get more cases ready for\r\nhearing more rapidly, larger translation resources will be\r\nrequired. Furthermore, if the members of the Court are to\r\nbe expected to handle massive international cases more\r\nspeedily, they will benefit from the assistance of law\r\nclerks, who so significantly assist other international and\r\nnational courts.\r\nThe Court has noted with further appreciation the\r\nreport and draft resolution submitted to the General\r\nAssembly by the Special Committee on the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of\r\nthe Organization (A/54/33), which lend support both to\r\nincreased budgetary resources for the Court and to the\r\nmeasures taken by it to accelerate the disposition of cases.\r\nThe Court wishes to offer timely justice to those\r\nwho come to it. Other international courts successfully\r\nfunction while affording parties less time for oral\r\nargument. It may be that the era when the International\r\nCourt of Justice routinely affords States weeks rather than\r\ndays, and days rather than hours for oral argument, may\r\nbe coming to an end. The restricted time limits imposed\r\nupon States in their presentation of oral argument in the\r\ncontext of advisory opinions has not given them apparent\r\ndifficulty.\r\nThe financial resources of the Court cannot be\r\ndivorced from those of the Organization that provides\r\nthem. The financial fabric of the United Nations must be\r\nrepaired, most fundamentally by renewed performance of\r\nthe treaty obligations of Members of the United Nations\r\nto pay their assessments, as determined by this General\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nAssembly in the exercise of the authority deliberately and\r\nexpressly entrusted to it by the terms of the Charter. The\r\nbinding character of those assessments was affirmed by the\r\nCourt in 1962, when it held that the exercise of the power\r\nof apportionment creates the obligation, specifically stated\r\nin Article 17, paragraph 2 of the Charter, of each Member\r\nto bear that part of the expenses which is apportioned to it\r\nby the General Assembly. Failure to meet that obligation\r\nnot only has the gravest effects on the life of the\r\nOrganization, but transgresses the principles of free consent,\r\ngood faith and pacta sunt servanda, which are at the heart\r\nof international law and relations.\r\nI said at the outset that where one stands depends on\r\nwhere one sits. In a measure, that is true. But of course the\r\nprinciples for which the Court stands are universal\r\nprinciples that merit universal support. As the Court enters\r\nthe first century of the third millennium, it stands for\r\ninternational law, not international lawlessness; for the\r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes in conformity\r\nwith international law, not with the will of the more\r\npowerful party; for international organization, not for\r\ninternational anarchy or for a State sovereignty which\r\npurports to be above the law. It stands for human rights —\r\nrights that can be effectively realized only within\r\nfunctioning systems of law, whether local, national or\r\ninternational.\r\nThe Court has no illusions about the extent of the\r\nprogress that has been made; it does not underestimate the\r\nextent of the challenges faced by the United Nations at\r\nlarge. But it counts it a continuing and profound privilege\r\nto join with the members of this General Assembly to\r\nreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity\r\nand worth of the human person and in the equal rights of\r\nmen and women and of nations large and small, and to\r\nendeavour to establish conditions under which justice and\r\nrespect for the obligations arising from treaties and other\r\nsources of international law can be maintained.\r\nMr. Hwang (Republic of Korea): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing, on behalf of my delegation, our warmest\r\nappreciation to the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, for his lucid\r\nintroduction of the report of the Court contained in\r\ndocument A/54/4. The report contains a comprehensive\r\naccount of cases and issues pertaining to the Court. The\r\nsizable array of cases clearly attests to the fact that the\r\nCourt is the legal forum where the most complex and\r\nsignificant themes in international law today are being\r\ninterpreted and applied. It also demonstrates that the Court,\r\nas the principal legal organ of the United Nations, is\r\neffectively fulfilling its responsibilities. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation would like to ask Judge Stephen M. Schwebel\r\nto convey its sincere respect and esteem to the other\r\njudges of the Court.\r\nSince its establishment in 1946, the International\r\nCourt of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, has developed qualitatively as well as\r\nquantitatively. In the period between 1946 and the 1970s,\r\nthe caseload of the International Court of Justice was not\r\nso burdensome. However, for several reasons there has\r\nbeen a substantial increase in the number of cases before\r\nthe Court since the early 1980s. One of the main reasons\r\nmay be that the decolonization and breakup of certain\r\nStates have dramatically expanded the Court\u0027s client base,\r\nwhich now includes 188 States. Moreover, the change in\r\nattitude towards adjudication and the evolving perception\r\nof the alleged bias of the Court in developing countries\r\nsince the end of the cold war have also contributed to a\r\nmarked increase in the docket sheet of the Court.\r\nReflecting the fundamental new direction that\r\ninternational relations have recently taken, the Court\u0027s\r\nsubject matter has also dramatically expanded to include\r\na wide variety of issues: maritime boundaries, territorial\r\nsovereignty, the use of force, non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States, diplomatic relations, hostage-\r\ntaking, the right to asylum, nationality, expropriation of\r\nforeign property and rights of passage. In this respect, the\r\nwork of the International Court of Justice is fundamental\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security in\r\ntoday\u0027s world.\r\nMy delegation shares the view of the International\r\nCourt of Justice regarding the increase in its workload\r\nand the implications of this development, as contained in\r\nthe report in document A/53/326. The Court has\r\nresponded to the dual challenges of an increased workload\r\nand insufficient resources through measures such as\r\nrationalizing the Registry, utilizing electronic technology\r\nand streamlining work procedures. While commending\r\nthis work done by the International Court of Justice so\r\nfar, we hope that practical measures will be taken as soon\r\nas possible to provide the Court with sufficient means to\r\ncontinue the important work entrusted to it by the Charter.\r\nThere is every reason to suppose that the rise in the\r\nnumber of cases coming before the Court will continue,\r\nand even accelerate, in the future. Indeed, experience tells\r\nus that judicial recourse takes place more frequently in\r\ntimes of détente than in times of tension. Furthermore,\r\nmore countries will in the future bring cases to the Court\r\nby special agreement. Many multilateral treaties now refer\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\ndisputes to the International Court of Justice for settlement,\r\nand there has been a gradual increase in the number of\r\nStates accepting the optional clause of the Court\u0027s Statute.\r\nAs a result, we must take the Court\u0027s appeal for more\r\nresources into serious account. In this regard, my delegation\r\ntakes note with great interest that the Advisory Committee\r\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions has given\r\nconsideration to the budgetary request of the Court and\r\nexpects that other relevant bodies of the Organization will\r\nalso respond to the legitimate demands of the Court.\r\nI now turn to the publications of the Court. This issue\r\nis very much bound up with the financial resources of the\r\nCourt. My delegation regrets that there is a backlog in the\r\npublication of the Court\u0027s Reports of Judgments, Advisory\r\nOpinions and Orders, as well as other documents. These\r\npublications will certainly contribute to the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law and its codification, as\r\nwell as better understanding of international law, by\r\nallowing readers easy access to valuable information on the\r\nwork of the Court. While welcoming the efforts of the\r\nCourt to disseminate such publications via electronic\r\ndatabase, my delegation hopes that the publication of the\r\nCourt\u0027s documents will be substantially improved in the\r\nnear future.\r\nOn the eve of a new millennium, we should make the\r\nInternational Court of Justice more responsive to the\r\ndemands of a dynamic and changing world. A new and\r\nstrengthened role for the Court should be sought in the\r\ncontext of the changing structures of both international\r\nsociety and international law. How to respond to the new\r\nrealities of an increasingly decentralized international\r\nsociety will be the main challenge for the International\r\nCourt of Justice in the future. If the challenges facing the\r\nCourt are not sufficiently addressed, the dispute settlement\r\nmechanism offered by the Court will likely lose its\r\ncredibility and perhaps its pre-eminent role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation wishes to draw the\r\nattention of the other Member States to the meetings of\r\nexperts held in The Hague and St. Petersburg, in May and\r\nJune of this year, respectively. Honouring the centennial of\r\nthe 1899 first International Peace Conference, experts,\r\nrapporteurs and legal advisors from Member States met\r\nwith specialists in the fields of disarmament, humanitarian\r\nlaw and the laws of war. To strengthen the role of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, participants tackled a variety\r\nof issues facing the Court, such as the expansion of its\r\nadvisory functions, widening access to contentious\r\njurisdictions of the Court, the Court\u0027s powers of judicial\r\nreview of the legality of actions of the Security Council\r\nand the composition of the Court itself.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that a thorough review\r\nof such medium and long-term proposals is needed\r\nbecause it could provide a useful guide to the challenges\r\nraised by the prospects for the functions of the Court in\r\nthe coming century. My delegation would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express its thanks to Professors Francisco\r\nOrrego Vicuña and Christopher Pinto for their valuable\r\nreport entitled “The peaceful settlement of disputes:\r\nprospects for the twenty-first century.”\r\nAllow me to conclude, by reaffirming on behalf of\r\nmy delegation and the Republic of Korea, our steadfast\r\nand unwavering support for the valuable work of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): It is an\r\nhonour for my delegation to speak once again during the\r\nAssembly\u0027s consideration of the report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. I want at the outset to thank\r\nMr. Schwebel, President of the Court, for having\r\npresented the report to us. His comments are always\r\nthought-provoking and invite discussion. We offer him\r\nour deepest appreciation.\r\nRecent years have seen a considerable increase in\r\nthe legal work of the Court. By way of illustration, let me\r\njust call attention to the fact that during the period\r\ncovered by the report — that is, from 1 August 1998 until\r\n31 July 1999 — 18 new contentious cases were submitted\r\nto the Court and there was one request for an advisory\r\nopinion. Even though some of the new cases are\r\ninterrelated or, perhaps, related to decisions handed down\r\nin the framework of other cases before the Court, the fact\r\nis that they result in a great deal of work. Quite apart\r\nfrom how the cases may be interrelated, each and every\r\none of them has to be dealt with separately and with\r\nspecial care, in accordance with the particular\r\ncircumstances. Likewise, we must stress that these 18 new\r\ncases come on top of the ongoing ones. Thus overall our\r\nhighest court now has before it 27 cases, and it is\r\npossible that new ones will be added in the near future.\r\nThese new developments are the source of mixed\r\nfeelings. On the one hand, it is certainly satisfying to see\r\nthat the International Court of Justice is increasingly\r\nconsidered the most appropriate forum for resolving inter-\r\nState disputes. Although ideally these disputes should\r\nnever arise, being able to submit them to the Court offers\r\nmany advantages. The intervention of an impartial and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\npermanent body that applies international law and issues\r\nbinding decisions, ensures the parties that their dispute will\r\nbe handled fairly. At the same time, the judicial decisions\r\nprovide an additional means of defining the rules of\r\ninternational law and make a valuable contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of international law.\r\nHowever, in the current situation, marked as it is by\r\nfinancial restrictions, an increase in the Court\u0027s judicial\r\nwork is a cause of serious concern. We must recognize that\r\nthe Court\u0027s procedures are not sufficiently expeditious and\r\nthat budgetary limitations are affecting the administration of\r\njustice and, therefore, the discharge of the responsibility\r\nentrusted to the Court by the Charter.\r\nThe judicial settlement of disputes is a complicated\r\ntask, and as a rule its results are not immediately felt. If we\r\nadd to these difficulties the fact that the proceedings are\r\nslow, or if there is a lack of resources to handle the case at\r\nissue, the outcome may well be counterproductive.\r\nSometimes excessive delays, rather than facilitating the\r\nsettlement of a dispute, may make it worse.\r\nAs a country resolutely devoted to peace and firmly\r\ndedicated to respect for international law, Mexico has been\r\nparticularly receptive to the various appeals made by the\r\nCourt for an increase in its budget. At the same time, we\r\nhave pronounced in favour of rationalizing the Court\u0027s\r\nprocedures in a two ways. First, we have encouraged the\r\nCourt to adopt all possible measures to make the processing\r\nof its cases easier. On the other hand, we have pointed out\r\nthat States that come before the Court should heed the\r\nCourt\u0027s recommendations and do their utmost to facilitate\r\nthe handling of their cases. This, among other things, would\r\nmean reducing the extent of their arguments — formulating\r\nthem clearly and concisely — and, as much as possible,\r\npresenting their documents already translated into the\r\nCourt\u0027s working languages.\r\nToday we are very pleased to see that some of the\r\nrequests of the Court, particularly those related to an\r\nincrease in its budget, are being heard. This is in part a\r\nresult of the efforts Mexico has made in this regard, both\r\nwithin the General Assembly and under the framework of\r\nthe Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization.\r\nThis year, upon Mexico\u0027s initiative, the Sixth Committee\r\nwill adopt a draft resolution thanking the Court for the\r\ninitial measures it has adopted to deal as efficiently as\r\npossible with the increased work load. The draft resolution\r\nalso calls on the Court to continue to review its procedures\r\nand urges States that come before the Court to abide by the\r\nCourt\u0027s guidance in this area. It urges the adoption of any\r\nother measure that might help speed up the proceedings.\r\nLikewise, during its 1999 sessions, the Special\r\nCommittee on the Charter felt there was a need to\r\nconsider the budgetary request of the Court, given the\r\nurgency of this issue, and the Special Committee\r\nwelcomed with satisfaction the fact that this request\r\nwould be considered by the relevant United Nations\r\nbodies.\r\nMexico notes with satisfaction that the Advisory\r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions\r\n(ACABQ) has considered the budgetary requests of the\r\nCourt, and, given the increase in the Court\u0027s work load,\r\nthe ACABQ has recommended to the Fifth Committee an\r\nincrease of the resources allocated to the Court. At the\r\nsame time we note that the recommended increase does\r\nnot reflect the minimum specified by the Court in\r\nparagraph 43 of the report in document A/53/326. We\r\nbelieve that the increase, such as it is, is a positive\r\ndevelopment, but much remains to be done in this area.\r\nAs the Court has said, the General Assembly must not\r\nunderestimate the importance of peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational conflicts by means of the law.\r\nIt is indispensable to ensure that the resources\r\nallocated to our highest judicial body be at least the\r\nminimum required to deal with the cases submitted to it.\r\nPreferential treatment to other bodies having subsidiary\r\njurisdiction cannot and should not continue indefinitely.\r\nUntil this situation is corrected, the issue should remain\r\na special priority item on our agenda. Mexico will\r\ncontinue to promote the strengthening of our highest\r\njudicial body.\r\nThis year marks the end of the United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law. One of the principal\r\nobjectives of this Decade has been the promotion of the\r\nuse of the International Court of Justice and the full\r\nimplementation of its judgments. We believe that the\r\nachievements of this Decade are encouraging, though we\r\nnote that further progress in the respect for and\r\nobservance of the norms of international law is still\r\nneeded.\r\nWe note with concern that some of the Court\u0027s\r\ndecisions, particularly those of a precautionary nature, are\r\nnot always respected by the parties concerned, thus\r\nputting at risk the very integrity of the cause in question.\r\nWe believe that there is a need to strengthen respect not\r\nonly for the judgements but for all the Court\u0027s orders and\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nmeasures. From this rostrum we appeal to all States that are\r\ninvolved in cases before the Court to abide by the Court\u0027s\r\ndecisions. This is the minimum requirement for giving\r\njudicial certainty to the actions that we, the States, have\r\nvoluntarily submitted to the Court\u0027s jurisdiction.\r\nMr. Kasanda (Zambia): Allow me at the outset to\r\nthank the President of the International Court of Justice,\r\nMr. Stephen Schwebel, for his very clear and lucid\r\nintroduction of the report on the activities of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for the period 1 August 1998\r\nto 31 July 1999, contained in document A/54/4. I would\r\nalso like to commend Mr. Schwebel and the members of\r\nthe Court for the active role they are playing in the\r\nstrengthening of the rule of law in international relations.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, as it has an important role to\r\nplay in the settlement of international disputes and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security through its\r\njudgments and advisory opinions. The Court does indeed\r\ncomplement the work of the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and bilateral negotiations between States.\r\nIt is an organ, in our view, that accords equal treatment to\r\nall nations and thus ensures the security and protection of\r\nsmall States.\r\nAlthough the Court today is not perceived as the last\r\nresort in the settlement of international disputes, we are\r\nencouraged to note that it is regaining its original role of\r\nbeing the most authoritative interpreter of the legal\r\nobligations of States in disputes between them. This is a\r\nwelcome development. This authoritative interpretation of\r\nlegal obligations has indeed, in most cases, helped parties\r\nto a dispute to clarify their positions and provided them\r\nwith legal conclusions on which to further their\r\nnegotiations. This has consequently led to the diffusion of\r\ntension and in some cases helped avoid armed\r\nconfrontation.\r\nThe work of the International Court of Justice has\r\ntaken a new turn during the past few years, as evidenced by\r\nthe increased number of States Members of the United\r\nNations that are now parties to the Statute of the Court;\r\nthose that have made declarations recognizing as\r\ncompulsory the jurisdiction of the Court; and new\r\ncontentious cases before the Court. All this shows that the\r\ninternational community is regaining confidence in the\r\nCourt and its jurisdiction.\r\nIn this regard, I am pleased to inform the Assembly\r\nthat my Government has already begun the internal process\r\nwhich will lead to its declaration recognizing the\r\njurisdiction of the Court. To this end, my delegation urges\r\nmore members to seriously consider recognizing the\r\njurisdiction of the Court to further strengthen its work.\r\nThe increased recognition of the Court\u0027s jurisdiction\r\nhas meant an increase in its workload. Unfortunately,\r\ndespite this increase, there has been no corresponding\r\ngrowth in the financial resources made available to the\r\nCourt. While the momentum is there to utilize the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, Member States should not\r\nbe discouraged from resorting to it by having the\r\nresolution of cases delayed for the simple reason that the\r\nCourt has no resources to deal with them.\r\nIt is therefore important that increased funding be\r\nextended to the Court to ensure that this organ, which\r\nassists in the resolution of conflicts through peaceful\r\nmeans and contributes to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, may discharge its duties effectively.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the statement by\r\nPresident Schwebel that if the Court is to fulfil its\r\npotential as the Organization\u0027s principal judicial organ, it\r\nmust be afforded the resources to work as intensively and\r\nexpeditiously as burgeoning international recourse to the\r\nCourt demands. In the same spirit, we also appeal to all\r\nMember States that are in a position to do so to\r\ncontribute towards the International Court of Justice\u0027s\r\nTrust Fund, which assists States in the judicial settlement\r\nof disputes. In this regard, we thank the Government of\r\nJapan for its recent contribution of $24,000 to the Fund.\r\nWe welcome the opening of the Museum of the\r\nCourt in the Peace Palace, which was inaugurated by\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan on 17 May 1999. The\r\nMuseum will serve as an invaluable source of history on\r\nthe evolution of the Court and a rich reference for the\r\nworld\u0027s legal systems. It is indeed a fount of knowledge\r\nfor professionals, academicians and, in particular, students\r\nof international law. It is the hope of my delegation that\r\nthe Museum will enhance the proper understanding of the\r\nfunctioning of the Court by Member States.\r\nIn conclusion, we also welcome the many talks and\r\nlectures on the Court given by the members of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice in order to improve public\r\nunderstanding of the judicial settlement of international\r\ndisputes, the jurisdiction of the Court and its function in\r\ncontentious and advisory cases. This, to my delegation,\r\nwas a major contribution by the Court to one of the\r\nobjectives of the Decade of International Law, which will\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\ncome to a close this year, in relation to the teaching, study,\r\ndissemination and wider appreciation of international law.\r\nWe believe that these lectures are very useful and we urge\r\nthe Court to continue the practice, as they promote\r\nawareness of international law.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me at the outset to convey to the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, Mr. Stephen Schwebel, our\r\ndeep appreciation for his introductory statement in the\r\ndebate on the Court\u0027s report. The Court can be proud of the\r\nauthority it has conferred upon the process of judicial\r\nsettlement, which was so long relegated to the margins. The\r\nCourt can be proud, in the words of President Bedjaoui, of\r\nhaving secularized international justice and made it a\r\nlandmark of our century. Proof of this is the Court\u0027s\r\nparticipation — of course, at the request of States — in the\r\nmanagement of the great concerns of the world today:\r\nsecurity, human rights, the environment and so on.\r\nMr. Schwebel and his peers, in speaking out on the\r\nmajor issues relating to the sacrosanct sovereignty of States,\r\nare exercising a profession that is unique in the world.\r\nCertainly, they do so with pride, but they also and above all\r\ndo so with a great deal of humility. How could it be\r\notherwise? They know that it is already uncomfortable\r\nenough for human beings to pass judgement on other\r\nhuman beings, touching as it does on almost metaphysical\r\nproblems. “Judges of the Earth, you are gods.” This\r\nequation of Henri François d\u0027Aguesseau, Chancellor of\r\nFrance, is more a reflection of an acute sense of crushing\r\nresponsibility than an expression of admiration.\r\nThus, what can be said of the President of the Court\r\nand of justice that is rendered by men upon States? This is\r\nall the more difficult and painful given the considerable\r\nvested interests that are always at stake. Fortunately,\r\nPresident Schwebel\u0027s conscience is sensitive to the point of\r\nobsession.\r\nHaving said that, I will now turn to the report on the\r\nCourt’s activities. Perhaps we should start with a dream and\r\na wish. The dream is of an international community where\r\neveryone fully recognizes the primacy of law and of peace.\r\nThe wish is that together, as we stand at the threshold of a\r\nnew century and a new millennium, we resolve firmly to\r\nspare no effort to make this dream a reality.\r\nThe International Court of Justice stands at a\r\ncrossroads. Created in a particular set of historical\r\ncircumstances, it has seen its role grow continuously\r\nthroughout the years. Today it must respond to a greater\r\nnumber of appeals on increasingly complex matters. At\r\nthe same time, it must face the emergence of new courts\r\nwith universal jurisdiction. I am thinking particularly of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, as well\r\nas of the trend of resorting to alternative methods of\r\nsettling disputes, such as international arbitration.\r\nIn view of the circumstances, the report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice of which we are seized\r\ninvites us to wonder about the position that the\r\ninternational community accords in real terms today to the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations. In our\r\nview, this position can best be appreciated by considering\r\nthree main criteria or indicators: declarations of\r\nacceptance, cases brought before the Court and the\r\nimplementation of its decisions.\r\nThe number of declarations made under article 36,\r\nparagraph 2, of its Statute is the first indicator of the\r\nacceptance of the Court in the domain of international\r\nrelations. This indicator is particularly important given the\r\noptional character of the recognition of the legal\r\njurisdiction of the Court. The consensual nature of the\r\nbases of international judicial competence means that no\r\nState can be summoned before a jurisdiction without its\r\nprior consent.\r\nAccording to the report of which we are seized, on\r\n31 July 1999, the 185 Member States of the United\r\nNations at the time, as well as Nauru and Switzerland,\r\nwere parties to the Statute of the International Court.\r\nHowever, on the same date, only 62 States, 18 of which\r\nwere from Africa, had made declarations recognizing the\r\nCourt’s jurisdiction as compulsory.\r\nUniversal acceptance of the Court’s compulsory\r\njurisdiction therefore remains a common challenge to be\r\naddressed. My delegation appeals to countries that have\r\nnot yet adhered to the optional clause of compulsory\r\njurisdiction to inscribe this item on their agendas and to\r\ngive it the greatest attention. Is not the refusal to\r\nrecognize the Court’s jurisdiction an anachronism, a\r\nthrowback to the era of the unlimited sovereignty of\r\nStates?\r\nWe consider that the question of submission by all\r\nStates to international jurisdiction and international law\r\nshould not be included among the parameters that today\r\ndefine the sovereignty of States.\r\nWe are not the only ones to demand insistently that\r\nMember States either recognize the compulsory\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\njurisdiction of the Court or withdraw or mitigate the\r\nparalysing reservations that accompany such recognition.\r\nIn his report “An Agenda for Peace” the United\r\nNations Secretary-General asked all States to accept the\r\nCourt’s jurisdiction unreservedly before the end of the\r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law.\r\nWe will always advocate the idea that international\r\ntribunals with compulsory jurisdiction should determine\r\nwhen international law has been violated, and that they\r\nshould be used as a framework for the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes.\r\nTo ensure the primacy of international law, it is\r\nessential courts of international jurisdiction be established\r\nto interpret and apply in all fairness the equitable rules that\r\ngovern peace and war, cooperation, development and the\r\nprotection of the individual.\r\nThe second indicator that permits us to appreciate the\r\neffectiveness of the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations is the number of cases brought before the Court.\r\nThe declaration referred to in Article 36, paragraph 2, of\r\nthe Statute of the Court is certainly of fundamental\r\nimportance, but as Judge Ranjeva has emphasized, it is\r\nmore a matter of intentions, since the number of cases\r\nbrought before the Court is the fullest actual expression of\r\nStates’ acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction.\r\nThe report before us shows that the number of cases\r\non the Court’s docket continues to grow significantly. In\r\nmy country’s view, this is a genuine source of satisfaction.\r\nThis process should certainly be encouraged.\r\nCameroon, as a State of law, attaches great importance\r\nto the peaceful settlement of disputes through courts, and\r\ntherefore by recourse to the International Court of Justice,\r\nas other forms of settlement have turned out to be\r\nineffective. This position is recalled constantly by our head\r\nof State, President Paul Biya. My country’s position is\r\nfurther underpinned by resolution 3232 (XXIX), in which\r\nthe General Assembly reaffirms that recourse to judicial\r\nsettlement of disputes, particularly referral to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, should not be considered an\r\nunfriendly act between States.\r\nThe growing number of cases brought before the\r\nCourt, and its concomitant heavy workload, calls urgently\r\nfor us to do everything possible to ensure that the Court\r\ncan continue to fulfil its function as the principal judicial\r\norgan of our Organization in the most effective way. This\r\nmeans, of course, that the Court needs to be provided\r\nwith additional human, material and financial resources.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the broad consensus that is\r\ntaking shape on this point. But it also means that we must\r\nreflect calmly on the Court’s organization, its functioning\r\nand its administration. In our view, these two processes\r\nshould be combined. At the same time, they must be\r\ncarried out with strict respect for independence and\r\nimpartiality, which, as we all know, are the essential\r\ncharacteristics of a court.\r\nIncreasing the resources made available to the Court\r\nand improving its functioning are all the more necessary\r\nbecause, in addition to its jurisdiction over contentious\r\nissues, its consultative work has also been experiencing\r\nsignificant development, as indicated in the report before\r\nus.\r\nI now come to the third and last important indicator\r\nof the Court’s acceptance and effectiveness: the\r\nimplementation of its decisions. In our view, willing and\r\nspeedy implementation of the Court’s decisions is a\r\ndemonstration of faith in international courts of law, an\r\nact that gives legal recourse its full meaning and weight.\r\nIndeed, what use would it be to accept the compulsory\r\njurisdiction of the Court, to submit cases to it or to appear\r\nbefore it if in the end a State was not ready to accept the\r\nCourt’s decision?\r\nThe universal mission of international law and the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, and the fact that the latter\r\nrepresents all the great civilizations and the main legal\r\nsystems of the world, can only provide assurance of the\r\nhigh quality of its decisions.\r\nOver the years, the Court has developed an\r\ninteresting jurisprudence on various issues, of which some\r\nare of great interest for the African countries, including\r\nmine — notably, the case on the question of boundaries.\r\nThe stability of the borders inherited from colonial\r\ntimes represents one of the mainstays of international\r\norder in Africa. That is why the judicial treatment of this\r\nquestion, which led the Court to insist on the general\r\napplicability of the principle of uti possidetis juris,\r\ngarnered the support of the African countries. This can be\r\nseen in the willing and speedy implementation of the\r\nCourt’s decisions on this issue, which was forthcoming\r\nbecause the Court strictly applied an existing law and\r\ntook the opportunity to give it general applicability.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nGenerally speaking, the implementation of the\r\nsubstantive decisions of the Court, even the most delicate\r\nones, has never met with any difficulty on the part of the\r\nAfrican States. Let us hope that this wise approach will last\r\nand will inspire the whole of the international community.\r\nOverall, it seems that the importance of the role of the\r\nCourt is not being called into question. But in regard to the\r\nthree indicators that we have examined, it has become clear\r\nthat the principal judicial body of the United Nations should\r\nbe considerably strengthened.\r\nThus, I wish to conclude as I started: with a dream\r\nand a wish. The dream is the dream of an international\r\ncommunity where the primacy of law and peace is fully\r\nestablished. And the wish is that we all commit ourselves\r\nto working together to realize that dream.\r\nMr. Rebagliati (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme at the outset to say that it is an honour for me to\r\naddress this General Assembly under the effective and\r\nexperienced guidance of its President. I would also like to\r\nthank the President of the International Court of Justice,\r\nMr. Stephen Schwebel, for his eloquent introduction of the\r\nreport of the Court over which he presides, a report which\r\ngives clear proof of the meaningful role that it plays in\r\ntoday’s international community.\r\nI take this opportunity also to offer well-deserved\r\npraise to Mr. Eduardo Valencia-Ospina, who has announced\r\nhis retirement. Mr. Valencia-Ospina has performed an\r\ninvaluable task as Registrar of the Court, prior to which he\r\ndistinguished himself in the United Nations Office of Legal\r\nAffairs. We trust that he will remain connected with the\r\nsystem in some capacity.\r\nThe legal tradition of the Republic of Argentina and\r\nits commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes is\r\nwell known. Thus, the Argentine delegation wishes to join\r\nwith those in the General Assembly who have expressed\r\ntheir satisfaction over the work being done by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice in the interpretation and\r\napplication of international law.\r\nI wish to reaffirm the great importance that the\r\nRepublic of Argentina attaches to the International Court of\r\nJustice as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.\r\nThe Court’s decisions are always an obligatory point of\r\nreference for all legal decisions made by the various\r\nagencies of our Government.\r\nI am especially pleased to be able to refer to the\r\nCourt’s activity at a time when the international legal\r\norder has become stronger and when there is growing\r\nawareness of the need to promote effective respect for the\r\nlegal norms that govern the international community. The\r\nlarge number of cases currently under consideration by\r\nthe Court on questions of the most diverse nature shows\r\nthat there is growing interest and willingness on the part\r\nof States to resolve their international disputes through the\r\nhighest tribunal of the Organization.\r\nBetween the end of the main part of the fifty-third\r\nsession and the beginning of the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the International Court of Justice\r\nheard questions of major relevance for the interpretation\r\nand identification of the norms and principles of\r\ninternational law. Confining ourselves only to the cases\r\nsubmitted in that period of time, we see that the Court\r\nwas called upon to rule on disputes relating to the use of\r\nforce — Yugoslavia versus Germany and other members\r\nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo versus Rwanda,\r\nBurundi and Uganda; genocide — Croatia versus\r\nYugoslavia; territorial disputes — Indonesia versus\r\nMalaysia; diplomatic protection — Guinea versus the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo; consular relations —\r\nGermany versus United States of America; and other\r\nequally important issues. This variety of topics, which is\r\nnot an exhaustive list of the matters under consideration\r\nby the Court, clearly shows that the Court is the forum\r\nthat analyses in a specific fashion the most complicated\r\nand relevant questions of international law.\r\nThe present vitality of the Court attests to the trust\r\nthat the Court inspires in States, which can be measured\r\nnot only by the large number of cases under\r\nconsideration, but also by the importance to those\r\ninvolved of the issues to be decided. Such trust has grown\r\nout of the prestige of that institution, which has been able\r\nto preserve throughout its history the virtues that\r\ncharacterize it: authority, integrity, impartiality and\r\nindependence.\r\nThis growing activity of the Court, which must be\r\napplauded as a highly positive development, nevertheless\r\ninvolves certain dangers. First, we have the problem that\r\nthe Court may not have adequate means to deal with the\r\ngrowing demands made on it. Therefore, it is necessary\r\nto provide the Court with the necessary resources to allow\r\nit to carry out its growing activity in proper conditions.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nThe problem of lack of means is related to a second\r\ndanger confronting the Court: that it may be used as a\r\npolitical arena. Indeed, the increase in the Court\u0027s activity\r\nhas stimulated debate on whether certain disputes referred\r\nto the Court are of a political or legal nature. We must\r\npoint out that any legal dispute involves political aspects\r\nand vice versa, and that the Court itself has, pointed out on\r\nmany occasions that the fact that a legal dispute may\r\ncontain political aspects is no obstacle to the Court\u0027s\r\njurisdiction. However, this means that States are obligated\r\nto exercise their right to resort to the Court responsibly in\r\norder to avoid abusing such resort as a means for the\r\nsettlement of disputes. In the final analysis, we must recall\r\nthat it is entirely within the exclusive competence of the\r\nCourt to decide whether the legal nature of a dispute is\r\nsufficient basis for the Court to have jurisdiction.\r\nInternational relations are taking on an increasingly\r\nlegal dimension. Therefore, jurisdictional methods for the\r\nsettlement of disputes and the organs that are to resolve\r\nthose disputes, have grown as much in number as have the\r\nsubjects dealt with. Nevertheless, the Court is, and will\r\ncontinue to be, the focal point of the international\r\ncommunity in the interpretation and application of\r\ninternational law.\r\nI wish to conclude by thanking once again the judges\r\nof the International Court of Justice for their indefatigable\r\nand effective work, which is to the benefit of international\r\npeace and security. The Argentine Republic is convinced\r\nthat the Court, with its well-deserved prestige, continues to\r\nmake a contribution to consolidating the process of the\r\nestablishment of a world order based on relations of\r\nfriendship and cooperation among States in accordance with\r\ninternational law.\r\nMr. Hamid (Pakistan): First of all, I would like to\r\nthank the President of the International Court of Justice,\r\nMr. Stephen Schwebel, for presenting to the General\r\nAssembly in a lucid manner the annual report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice covering the period from 1\r\nAugust 1998 to 31 July 1999.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to reaffirm Pakistan\u0027s\r\ncommitment to the work of the International Court of\r\nJustice, which is the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations. The Court, which for many years has been the\r\ncornerstone of an international legal system built on respect\r\nfor the rule of law, has played an indispensable role in\r\nhelping Member States in the peaceful settlement of their\r\ndisputes.\r\nSince its inception in 1946, the Court has served as\r\nthe focal point for the peaceful resolution of international\r\ndisputes and for the development of international law\r\nthrough its judgments and advisory opinions. Its\r\nachievements in furthering the principles and purposes of\r\nthe United Nations Charter for maintaining international\r\npeace and security, developing friendly relations among\r\nnations and enhancing international cooperation in\r\nresolving disputes have been remarkable.\r\nThe success of the International Court of Justice in\r\ndealing with some of the most difficult international\r\ndisputes of our time could be judged by the fact that the\r\nCourt\u0027s decisions have been accepted by the States\r\nconcerned and their implementation has posed no\r\ndifficulty. This, besides enhancing the prestige of the\r\nCourt, has enabled it to make a significant contribution to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nPakistan believes that if all countries conducted their\r\nrelations with other States in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of international law, there would be fewer\r\ndisputes and conflicts, and recourse to the International\r\nCourt of Justice would also be minimal. Unfortunately,\r\nthis does not happen in the real world, and we often come\r\nacross instances in which the norms and principles of\r\ninternational law are not respected and States resort to\r\nmethods which are either in violation of established\r\ninternational norms or in breach of a bilateral or\r\nmultilateral agreement to which they are party. In these\r\ncircumstances, the presence of the International Court of\r\nJustice is a source of consolation for aggrieved States,\r\nwhich know where to turn for their grievances.\r\nIn recent years, though the Court has witnessed an\r\nincrease in the volume of cases brought before it —\r\nwhich is indeed a reflection of the high respect acquired\r\nby the Court in the community of nations — there still\r\nremain a number of factors which impede States for\r\nreferring cases to the Court. One of these factors is the\r\nfinancial implications of participation in proceedings\r\nbefore the Court. Sometimes States, in particular least\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, do not have\r\nsufficient financial resources to resort to the Court for\r\nresolution of their legal differences. In this regard,\r\nPakistan was appreciative of the initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General to establish in 1989 a Trust Fund to\r\nassist States in the settlement of disputes through the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. Since the Fund is financed\r\nthrough voluntary contributions, we would call upon\r\npotential donors to make financial contributions to it,\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nwhich would certainly be a contribution to the cause of\r\ninternational peace and justice.\r\nFinally, I would like to say few words on the\r\nproblems being faced by the Court due to financial\r\nconstraints. In the recent past, there has been a manifold\r\nincrease in the workload of the Court. However, the growth\r\nin its annual budget has not been proportionate to the\r\nincreased caseload. In order to perform its functions and\r\ncarry out its responsibilities, it is important that Court\u0027s\r\nwork should not be hampered by the shortage of funds. We\r\nfully support the Court\u0027s request for an increase in the\r\nallocation of financial resources and call upon the\r\ncompetent bodies of the United Nations to consider on a\r\npriority basis the question of increasing the resources of the\r\nCourt.\r\nMr. Droushiotis (Cyprus): It is a particular honour\r\nand pleasure for the delegation of Cyprus to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly as it considers the report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. We attach great importance\r\nto the role and work of the International Court of Justice\r\nand to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means in\r\nconformity with justice and international law, as provided\r\nfor in the United Nations Charter. This occasion offers us\r\nthe opportunity to commend the Court highly on its\r\nsignificant work as the principal judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, and to pay tribute to and express our\r\nrespect for its President, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, and\r\nits members, who eminently serve the Court with dedication\r\nand distinction.\r\nWe are once again grateful to the President of the\r\nCourt for his lucid introduction of the report and for his\r\ninsightful remarks on the work and functioning of the\r\nCourt. The annual address of the President of the Court to\r\nthe General Assembly has become a welcome practice and\r\na highlight of the item\u0027s consideration by the Assembly.\r\nThe increased activity of the Court, either through\r\nsubmission of contentious cases or through requests for\r\nadvisory opinions, is a very welcome development. The\r\ndiversity of cases before it — submitted by States from\r\nvarious regions of the world and differing legal systems,\r\nconcerning a wide range of matters — is a positive\r\nreflection of the Court\u0027s general jurisdiction being open to\r\nall States and of the confidence and recognition the Court\r\nenjoys as the Organization\u0027s principal judicial organ. We\r\nhope that this growing willingness to resort to the Court\r\nand the prevailing “law habit” among States — as\r\nhighlighted by the United Nations Decade of International\r\nLaw — will be marked by an increase in the number of\r\ndeclarations by States recognizing without reservation the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court, as contemplated by\r\nArticle 36 of its Statute.\r\nIt is now widely recognized that the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes within the framework of the\r\nCharter requires an integrated and coordinated approach\r\ncombining more than one category of strategies of dispute\r\nsettlement. A welcome development in this regard is the\r\nincreasing recourse to the International Court of Justice in\r\nparallel with other methods of dispute resolution, which\r\nemphasizes the role of the Court in the United Nations\r\nsystem for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nIn this regard, chapter IV of the report in document\r\nA/54/4, on the role of the Court, which contains a\r\nsummary of the points made by the President of the Court\r\nin his address to the Assembly last year, is highly notable.\r\nThese points, in paragraph 266 of the report, are that the\r\nCourt “is no longer seen solely as the last resort\u0027 in the\r\nresolution of disputes” and that “States may have recourse\r\nto the Court in parallel with other methods of dispute\r\nresolution, appreciating that such recourse may\r\ncomplement the work of the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as bilateral negotiations”. It is\r\nalso important that he observed that “in this combined\r\nprocess of dispute resolution, judicial recourse has helped\r\nparties clarify their positions and that the Court\u0027s decision\r\nin other cases has provided the parties with legal\r\nconclusions which they may use in framing further\r\nnegotiations and in achieving the settlement of a dispute”.\r\nIn this regard, I wish to recall that Cyprus has\r\naccepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under\r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute. Moreover, we\r\nhave declared our readiness to submit the legal\r\ncomponents of the Cyprus problem to the International\r\nCourt of Justice for adjudication, either by way of\r\ncontentious or advisory proceedings.\r\nA fitting example of this complementary strategy of\r\npolitical and judicial resolution of disputes working in\r\nparallel that readily comes to mind at this session, when\r\nthe Assembly is presided over by Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nForeign Minister of Namibia, is the Namibia case of\r\n1971, through which the Court rendered an advisory\r\nopinion, upon the request of the Security Council, on the\r\nlegal obligations of States arising from the illegal\r\npresence of the then regime of South Africa in Namibia.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nAlso noteworthy in that case, by way of example of\r\nthe Court\u0027s important contributions to human rights law,\r\nwas the Court’s finding that apartheid was objectively\r\nillegal and was a flagrant violation of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter.\r\nIn addition, the Court, as the most authoritative\r\ninterpreter of the United Nations Charter, determined the\r\nbinding character of resolutions of the Security Council\r\nunder Article 25 of the Charter.\r\nThere are several more recent examples of combining\r\npolitical and judicial resolution of disputes, as set out by\r\nthe report of the Court and mentioned by its President\r\nearlier this morning.\r\nFurthermore, in relation to the role and functioning of\r\nthe Court, I would like to note that at major treaty-making\r\nconferences and other legal forums, Cyprus has consistently\r\nadvocated compulsory third-party dispute settlement\r\nprocedures entailing a binding decision. In this regard, we\r\nhave accorded the highest respect to the Court as the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations.\r\nLastly, as appears in the report, the increasing\r\ncaseload of the Court places great pressure on its human\r\nand financial resources. The Court should be provided with\r\nthe means it needs to function properly and effectively as\r\nthe Organization\u0027s principal judicial organ.\r\nMay I mention in passing that as a token of our\r\nsupport for the Court and the importance we attach to the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, Cyprus was among the first\r\nStates to contribute to the Court\u0027s Trust Fund established to\r\nassist developing countries financially in availing\r\nthemselves of and utilizing the Court.\r\nBeing a small State, Cyprus relies on the principles\r\nand norms of international law and on the United Nations\r\nCharter and on their strict and full application. Cyprus\r\nascribes great importance to the International Court of\r\nJustice as the highest judicial organ of the United Nations.\r\nIn view of the announced end of the tenure of the\r\nPresident of the Court, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, and of\r\nthe Registrar of the Court, Mr. Eduardo Valencia-Ospina,\r\nwe wish to express our highest appreciation for their\r\ncommitment and dedication to the work of the Court.\r\nPresident Schwebel\u0027s contributions to the Court have been\r\nmeaningful and profound. While they will be retiring from\r\nthe Court, we look forward in the future to their continued\r\nvaluable contributions in the field of International law.\r\nMr. Zmeevski (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Russian Federation attaches great\r\nimportance to the work of the International Court of\r\nJustice, for, as one of the main organs of the United\r\nNations, it must be in the forefront of efforts to achieve,\r\nwithin the framework of its mandate, the goals of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nWhat we are referring to, of course, is efforts in\r\nsupport of international peace and security. The Court has\r\nalready made an important contribution to defending the\r\nkey provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, and\r\nits decision as to the binding nature of those provisions of\r\nour Charter that refer to the non-resort to force has\r\nbecome a cornerstone of international law. And now, at\r\na time when humankind must determine the parameters of\r\nthe world in which we wish to live, the Court takes on\r\neven greater importance.\r\nOn the threshold of a new millennium, we must\r\nwork together to develop a comprehensive interpretation\r\nof our international commitments in the interest of\r\nhumankind as a whole. Previous generations of human\r\ncivilization have handed down to us a broad panoply of\r\npeaceful means of reaching decisions, including bringing\r\ncases before the International Court. Reason, when it is\r\ncollective legal reason, can be much more effective than\r\nthe use of force in international affairs.\r\nAs the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Mr.\r\nIvanov, underscored in his statement during this session\r\nof the General Assembly,\r\n“In general, we should take an extremely careful\r\napproach to coercive measures; what is more, we\r\nmust not allow them to turn into a repressive\r\nmechanism for influencing States and peoples that\r\nare not to the liking of some.” (A/54/PV.6)\r\nThis was the thinking behind the proposal made by\r\nRussia and Belarus to the Special Committee on the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of\r\nthe Role of the Organization to request a consultative\r\ndecision from the International Court on the legal\r\nimplications of the use of armed force in circumvention\r\nof the Charter.\r\nInternational legality is a mechanism for the\r\nmaintenance of peace, and it is peace that makes it\r\npossible to mete out that justice. If we are to work for\r\npeace and sustainable development without violence, we\r\nmust redouble our efforts to strengthen the international\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nlegal basis for a global order and ensure the rule of law in\r\ninternational affairs. The efforts of the International Court\r\ncould go a long way towards making this happen.\r\nOne of the suggestions contained in the proposal by\r\nthe President of Russia, Mr. Yeltsin, on a world concept for\r\nthe twenty-first century is to make broader use, within the\r\ncontext of reforming and adapting the United Nations to a\r\nchanged world, of follow-up and implementation measures\r\nand of Court mechanisms and procedures. The goal would\r\nbe to provide further safeguards against the circumvention\r\nof international law and to enhance the role of the\r\nInternational Court with respect to the application and\r\nstrengthening of mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes.\r\nIt is, of course, the evolution of world affairs that\r\ndictates the advisability of developing the provisions of\r\ninternational law and adapting them to new realities.\r\nHowever, this should be done not by bringing individual\r\ncases before the Court but by sitting down together and\r\ntaking appropriate decisions within the context of existing\r\nprovisions of international law. This is the reason for the\r\nRussian initiative to discuss at the Millennium Summit the\r\nlegal aspects of the use of force in international relations in\r\na globalized world. We call upon all States to enter into a\r\nbroad-based, open dialogue on this issue.\r\nMr. Stanislaus (Grenada), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nIt would doubtless be useful to do research, under\r\nUnited Nations auspices, on this subject. In this way we\r\nwould be able to objectively analyse the provisions of\r\ninternational law regulating the use of force in international\r\nrelations; to study the ways in which these provisions have\r\nbeen interpreted and applied, including in rulings of the\r\nInternational Court; to compare the requirements of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations with similar equivalent\r\nprovisions and standards in regional instruments; to collect\r\nexamples of Security Council actions taken in the context\r\nof responding to so-called humanitarian crises; and to list\r\nprecedents of the use of force in circumvention of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations to learn of the reasoning\r\nbehind them, the reaction of the international community,\r\nand the consequences for third countries.\r\nWe would like to express our deep gratitude to the\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Mr. Stephen\r\nSchwebel, for the very comprehensive account he has given\r\nof the work of the Court. We agree with him that if the\r\nCourt is to fulfil its potential as the principal judicial organ\r\nof the Organization, it needs resources so that it can work\r\nas intensively and as effectively as is required by the\r\nincreasing number of cases brought before the Court by\r\nStates.\r\nThe entire budget of the International Court today is\r\n$11 million a year. Percentage-wise, this is less than the\r\nequivalent amount allocated for the Court in the 1946\r\nUnited Nations budget. By comparison, the Yugoslavia\r\nTribunal has received $94 million. Furthermore, while the\r\nInternational Court has 57 staff members, the Yugoslavia\r\nTribunal has 794. We should give very careful thought to\r\nwhether this disproportion is justified.\r\nThe annual discussion of the Court\u0027s report in the\r\nGeneral Assembly is proof of its significance to the\r\ninternational community and also demonstrates how\r\nimportant it is for us to strengthen cooperation between\r\nall United Nations bodies with a view to coordinating\r\nefforts to implement the purposes and principles of the\r\nOrganization. We believe that we should consider at this\r\nsession a practical and constructive way of strengthening\r\nthe role of the highest judicial organ of the United\r\nNations, and we are prepared to contribute fully to this\r\nendeavour.\r\nMr. Niehaus (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation would like to express its wholehearted\r\ngratitude for the report of the International Court of\r\nJustice and its introduction by the President of the Court,\r\nJudge Stephen Schwebel.\r\nThe legal settlement of disputes is indispensable for\r\nthe peaceful development of the international community.\r\nDifferences with respect to law or facts, if politicized, can\r\nbecome threats to international peace and security.\r\nTerritorial disputes in particular can lead to military\r\nescalation. In this connection, recourse to the International\r\nCourt of Justice is a fundamental mechanism for reducing\r\ninternational tension and for the final settlement of\r\ndisputes between States. My delegation takes note with\r\nsatisfaction of the work done by the Court to foster peace\r\nand security in the various cases that are before it.\r\nAs the principal judicial body of the United Nations,\r\nthe International Court of Justice also plays a key role in\r\nthe progressive development of contemporary\r\ninternational law. Its jurisprudence, in contentious cases\r\nas well as in advisory opinions, not only determines the\r\nlaw for parties in conflict, but also sheds light on\r\nquestionable or controversial areas of the law for the\r\nbenefit of other States. In many instances, the Court has\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nadopted progressive positions that have pointed the way for\r\nand consolidated the development of the international legal\r\norder. We also take note of its role as the authority for\r\ninterpreting the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\r\nCosta Rica is grateful and expresses its appreciation to the\r\nCourt for this work.\r\nMy delegation is aware of the practical problems\r\nexperienced by the Court in recent years, which result from\r\nan increase in the number of cases and requests for\r\nadvisory opinions. Nevertheless, we do not believe that\r\nsuch problems need result from the number of cases or that\r\nwe should therefore discourage the Court from taking them\r\non. On the contrary, we believe that the increase in the\r\nnumber of cases is a positive sign of the will of States to\r\nsubmit themselves to the principles of law in the conduct of\r\ntheir international relations.\r\nWe believe that the practical difficulties in the work\r\nof this lofty tribunal result from the budgetary constraints\r\nto which it is subjected to in the context of its growing\r\nresponsibilities. We are pleased to note that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and\r\nBudgetary Questions have requested a small increase in the\r\nbudget of the Court. My delegation will support this\r\nincrease when it is considered by the Fifth Committee of\r\nthe General Assembly, and we trust that other delegations\r\nwill do likewise.\r\nHowever, we fear that such additional resources will\r\nprove inadequate to enable the Court to tackle all of its\r\nresponsibilities. We believe that in future budgets, greater\r\nfunding should be allocated to the Court. My delegation\r\nwould welcome an increase in the personnel of the Court,\r\nincluding additional archival, computer and secretariat staff,\r\nin addition to a professional team to provide technical and\r\nlegal assistance to the judges and the presidency, as\r\nsuggested in the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nconsequences for the Court of the increase in the number\r\nof cases before it, which was issued last year. With regard\r\nto assistants and gratis personnel, my delegation reaffirms\r\nthe position that it has expressed repeatedly in the Fifth\r\nCommittee.\r\nWe thank the Court for the efforts it has made to\r\nimprove its work. My delegation is actively supporting\r\nvarious proposals in the Special Committee on the Charter\r\nand in the Sixth Committee to strengthen the International\r\nCourt of Justice, and we welcomed with satisfaction the\r\ndraft resolution which is included in paragraph 122 of the\r\nreport (A/54/33) of the Special Committee. However, we\r\nbelieve that several areas of the Court\u0027s activity could be\r\nfurther improved, and while we scrupulously support the\r\nprinciple of the judicial independence of the Court, we\r\nshould like, with all due respect, to make a few\r\nsuggestions. We believe that the International Court of\r\nJustice is a mechanism in the service of States, and if it\r\nis to remain valid it must respond actively and effectively\r\nto the needs of those who use it.\r\nWould it not therefore be appropriate for the judges\r\nto limit the length of their dissenting or separate opinions\r\nto no more than 5 or 10 pages? Would there not be an\r\nimprovement in judicial activity if States elected judges\r\nwho could understand easily both official languages and\r\nif we imposed age limits in electing judges? Would it not\r\nbe fair to provide more opportunities for women to\r\nbecome members of the Court? Would it not be\r\nappropriate for States to elect judges exclusively from\r\ncountries that have accepted the compulsory jurisdiction\r\nof the Court in accordance with Article 36, paragraphs 2\r\nand 5, of the Statute? Do not some of the\r\nrecommendations of Professor Bowett, Professor\r\nCrawford, Sir Ian Sinclair and Sir Arthur Watts, published\r\nin 1996, have validity?\r\nWe trust that the Court, as well as States, will\r\ncontinue to consider, through both the Special Committee\r\non the Charter and the General Assembly, possible\r\nimprovements in the practices of this principal judicial\r\norgan of the Organization.\r\nFinally, we should like to thank the Court for the\r\nexcellent work of dissemination that it has been carrying\r\nout through the Internet. This is invaluable, especially to\r\ndeveloping States, which sometimes have difficulties in\r\ngaining access to information about the latest activities of\r\njurisprudence.\r\nMr. Tudela (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I should like\r\nat the outset to congratulate Judge Stephen Schwebel for\r\nthe detailed report on the work of the International Court\r\nof Justice at its previous session, which he introduced to\r\nus today. Peru takes this opportunity to reaffirm its\r\ncommitment to international law and its firm support for\r\nthe activities of the Court as the principal judicial body of\r\nthe United Nations. We are pleased to see that there has\r\nbeen a gradual increase in recourse to the Court, as\r\nreflected by the fact that 18 new contentious cases and\r\none advisory case were submitted to the Court during its\r\nprevious session.\r\nWe will not on this occasion refer to the diverse\r\nmatters that are before the Court in contentious cases, but\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nwe believe that it is necessary to emphasize that its\r\nexcellent jurisprudence has significantly contributed to the\r\nprogressive institutionalization of international law and that,\r\nin addition, in many cases the Court has served as a forum\r\nin which, while preparing their pleas, States in litigation\r\nhave identified points of convergence that have laid the\r\nfoundations for subsequent agreement.\r\nFurthermore, with regard to its advisory function, the\r\nCourt, through its 23 advisory opinions, has made important\r\ncontributions as the authority for interpreting the United\r\nNations Charter and in deciding juridical matters that have\r\narisen within the domain of the activities of the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the 16 organizations\r\nauthorized to request advisory opinions. Of these, we\r\naccord particular importance to the Advisory Opinion of 8\r\nJuly 1996 on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear\r\nWeapons, which points to the urgent need for States to\r\nundertake negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nThe financial situation of the Court is cause for\r\nconcern for Peru, particularly when we take into account\r\nthe increase in the number of cases that are being submitted\r\nto it. If we want the Court to continue to make its\r\nimportant contribution with the same degree of efficiency,\r\nwe believe it necessary for the United Nations to pay\r\nparticular attention to the legitimate demand for the Court\r\nto be provided with sufficient financial resources to\r\nadequately handle the work created not only by the increase\r\nin the number of cases but also by the need to maintain and\r\nincrease the information service that the Court has provided\r\nthrough its Internet site. In this context, we are pleased to\r\nsee that that site, which was inaugurated in September\r\n1997, is being consistently improved, while the many\r\nvisitors that enter the site include a growing number of\r\ndiplomats, lawyers, students, politicians and members of the\r\ngeneral public.\r\nPeru welcomes the improvements achieved in this area\r\nand urges the Court, and particularly its Computerization\r\nCommittee, to continue its efforts to use computers to\r\npublicize its work. In contrast with the progress in this area,\r\nas chapter IX of the report of the Court points out,\r\npublications are suffering from a lamentable delay —\r\nbasically due to the Court\u0027s delicate financial situation —\r\nwhich we hope will be overcome, particularly with regard\r\nto the Court\u0027s Pleadings, Oral Arguments, Documents and\r\nReports of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders.\r\nFinally, we are also pleased by the inauguration of the\r\nMuseum of the Court in the Peace Palace in May of this\r\nyear by the Secretary-General. We believe that this can\r\nfurther promote knowledge among the visiting public of\r\nthe functions of the Court, of the institution of judicial\r\nresolution of international disputes and of the importance\r\nof international law and justice in the preservation of\r\npeace.\r\nPeru, which throughout its history has shown in its\r\ninternational relations a deep attachment to international\r\nlaw and which has on occasion resorted to the jurisdiction\r\nof the Court, will persevere in its efforts so that the Court\r\ncan continue to attain its lofty goals in the pursuit of\r\npeace and of the rule of law. To this end, Peru urges all\r\nStates that are involved in disputes to submit them to the\r\nCourt in order to find peaceful solutions under the\r\nprotection of international law.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I wish to say that we are pleased and honoured to\r\nextend our thanks to the President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice and to the honourable members of the\r\nCourt for the comprehensive report on the Court and its\r\nwork from August 1998 to July 1999.\r\nWe would also like to express our satisfaction at the\r\nstatement by Judge Stephen Schwebel, the President of\r\nthe Court, before the General Assembly today; we thank\r\nhim for his comprehensive statement.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the submission of the Court\u0027s\r\nreport to the General Assembly at its current session\r\ncoincides with the conclusion of the Decade of\r\nInternational Law, one of whose four major objectives\r\nwas to “promote means and methods for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes between States, including resort to\r\nand full respect for the International Court of Justice”.\r\nThis imbues the Court\u0027s current report with a special\r\ncharacter, since this objective for the Decade of\r\nInternational Law coincides with the supreme objective\r\nbehind the establishment of the International Court of\r\nJustice in 1946: that the Court should be an effective,\r\nefficient judicial means for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes. Since the Court stands for the enforcement of\r\nthe principles of neutrality and justice in international\r\nrelations, resorting to it to settle disputes is a true\r\nmeasure of civilization and a genuine measure of\r\ninclination towards and yearning for peace.\r\nSixty-two of the world\u0027s States have so far accepted\r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court provided for in\r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute. My country is\r\ngreatly honoured to be among those States. In addition to\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nthat Article, about 100 international conventions contain\r\nprovisions for settling disputes by resort to the International\r\nCourt of Justice. This reassures us of the growing role of\r\nthe Court in the area of international relations and the\r\njudicial settlement of disputes. In this regard, we reiterate\r\nthe call made by the General Assembly for Member States\r\nto accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nAn increase in the Court\u0027s resources, enabling it to\r\nshoulder the growing burdens referred to in the reports of\r\nthe Court this year and last year, is relevant to the growth\r\nof the role of the Court and necessary for according it full\r\nrespect. The Court cannot but respond to its duty in\r\nconsidering the cases brought before it and handing down\r\nthe advisory opinions required of it. The United Nations, in\r\nturn, should make the provision of necessary and sufficient\r\nresources to the Court a duty and a high priority, regardless\r\nof the financial constraints facing the United Nations itself;\r\nfor the provision of sufficient resources is linked to one of\r\nthe most important principles of the United Nations: the\r\nmaintenance of peace. Moreover, the additional resources\r\nrequested by the Court are modest, and the United Nations\r\nshould find no difficulty in securing them.\r\nIn the report submitted by the President of the Court,\r\nthere was an important reference to the fact that resorting\r\nto the Court at times of tension and crisis allows for a\r\nrelaxation of tensions even before a settlement is reached,\r\nand in some cases permits the resumption and success of\r\nstalled political negotiations. This shows the Court\u0027s\r\npotential, by virtue of its character and its work, for\r\nguaranteeing the peaceful settlement of disputes, even at\r\ntheir most tense. Similarly, the report mentions that the\r\ninstances of resort to the Court in times of peace outnumber\r\nthose in times of tension and conflict. This means that the\r\nStates in conflict resort to the Court of their own volition,\r\nhand in hand, without necessarily allowing the dispute to\r\nundermine the links, bonds and relations existing between\r\nthem. This, we think, enhances peace-building and\r\npromotes the culture of peace.\r\nThe unique situation of the International Court of\r\nJustice makes us all the more certain of the importance of\r\nits role; hence our constant demand for the full\r\nimplementation of the Charter\u0027s provisions that prevent the\r\nwork and responsibilities of the Court from being\r\nswallowed up by other United Nations bodies.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. May I take it that it is\r\nthe wish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 26\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/180)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.14)\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 477 (V) of 1 November 1950, I now\r\ncall on the observer for the League of Arab States.\r\nMr. Hassouna (League of Arab States) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Allow me to begin by congratulating the\r\nPresident as sincerely as possible on his election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are confident that, thanks to him, this will\r\nbe a successful session, particularly given how historic it\r\nis to have the last session of the century presided over by\r\na freedom fighter well known for his experience, his\r\nskills and his diplomacy. The President has done so much\r\nfor our brotherly country Namibia, a country highly\r\nrecognized and respected throughout the Arab world.\r\nAs we stand at the threshold of a new millennium,\r\nthe world is in an optimistic mood, as clearly expressed\r\nby all the delegations speaking during this session. In\r\ntheir statements, the various States have praised the role\r\nof the United Nations as a whole and have spoken of its\r\nnoble tasks, as well as of their desire to see the\r\nOrganization succeed in fulfilling its tasks and\r\nresponsibilities despite the many new challenges we face\r\nas we move into a new century with so much change at\r\nthe international, regional and national levels.\r\nFor its part, the League of Arab States is also\r\nlooking towards the new millennium with confidence and\r\noptimism. We are looking forward to even more close\r\nand constructive cooperation with the United Nations and\r\nits specialized agencies, so that together we can offer the\r\nworld peace, stability and mutual understanding and\r\ncreate a world based on dialogue between civilizations, on\r\nconciliation and on respect for moral values and the rule\r\nof law in the relations between nations and peoples.\r\nThe League of Arab States is the foremost regional\r\norganization, established in 1945 within the framework of\r\nthe international order that emerged at the end of the\r\nSecond World War. The League is now embarking on the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nthird millennium with a full awareness of its increasing role\r\nas a partner of the United Nations in the various spheres of\r\nlife — in politics, economics, society, culture, law and\r\nadministration. We are supported in this endeavour by the\r\ncurrent approach to modernizing its structures and\r\nmechanisms. These efforts include the establishment of,\r\ninter alia, a free-trade area among the Arab States, an\r\nagreement to combat terrorism, an Arab court of justice and\r\nmechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes. All\r\nthese measures are aimed at enabling our regional\r\norganization to cope with the new regional and global\r\nrealities.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General contained in\r\nA/54/180 outlines the contacts and consultations undertaken\r\nrecently between the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab\r\nStates, as well as between the League\u0027s Permanent Observer\r\nand high-ranking officials of the United Nations. Much has\r\nbeen done on questions of common interest. Representatives\r\nof the League of Arab States have had very high-level\r\nconsultations, for example with Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan, during the last two sessions of the General\r\nAssembly. They have spoken on regional and international\r\nissues of concern to the Arab world, including the question\r\nof Palestine, the Middle East peace process, Iraq, Libya,\r\nSomalia and the Comoros.\r\nThere have undoubtedly been successful efforts in the\r\ncontainment or resolution of many crises, such as the\r\nLockerbie issue, some phases of the conflict between the\r\nUnited Nations and Iraq, and the problem of Somalia.\r\nThese successes are the result of the constant process of\r\nconsultation and the constructive approach of the two sides\r\nin this dialogue.\r\nThe cooperative relationship between the United\r\nNations and the Arab League took another turn for the\r\nbetter this year at the very fruitful meetings of the\r\nsecretariats of the United Nations and the League of Arab\r\nStates and their specialized agencies. The meeting of the\r\nsecretariats took a very close look at the areas in which the\r\ntwo organizations work together and at areas where more\r\ncould be done to cooperate. Among the most important\r\nachievements of this meeting was the agreement to hold a\r\nsectoral meeting at the Economic and Social Commission\r\nfor Western Asia, in Beirut in May 2000, on the subject of\r\nyouth and employment. This meeting would be of great\r\neconomic and social importance for the Arab region. The\r\nArab League would like to thank the Secretariat for its\r\nconstant efforts to make sure that the enhanced relationship\r\nbetween our two organizations continues successfully.\r\nDiscussion of the report on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States is very\r\nmuch in tune with the efforts of these international\r\norganizations to establish a just, comprehensive and\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. In pursuit of this\r\ngoal, the League of Arab States would like to reaffirm the\r\nnotion that the international community, as represented by\r\nthe United Nations, should respect and support the\r\ncomponents of such peace. This means supporting,\r\ninter alia, the resolutions of international legitimacy, such\r\nas Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973)\r\nand 425 (1978), the principle of land for peace, and the\r\nright of Palestinians to self-determination, including an\r\nindependent Palestinian State. The Palestinian people\r\nshould receive the necessary support in their struggle to\r\ngain their legitimate rights and establish their own\r\nindependent State on their national territory, with\r\nJerusalem as its capital. Israeli attempts to change the\r\ndemography and geography of Jerusalem cannot bear fruit\r\nin the face of the resolute decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe problem of Palestinian refugees must be justly\r\nresolved in accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n194 (III) of 1948, which stipulates their right to return to\r\ntheir land or the right to compensation, and the rejection\r\nof any attempts to settle them outside Palestine. The\r\ninternational community is called upon to fulfil its\r\nobligations towards the process of development and\r\nreconstruction in Palestinian lands, which would have a\r\npositive effect on the peace process. It has to ensure the\r\nsuccess of the Palestinian festival, “Bethlehem 2000”, in\r\ncelebration of the end of the second millennium since the\r\nbirth of Christ — may God\u0027s peace be upon him.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 465 (1980), stating that\r\nIsraeli settlements are illegal and must be dismantled,\r\nmust be respected. The Fourth Geneva Convention\r\nrequires Israel to adhere to these provisions and the\r\nconvening of a new peace conference if Israeli violations\r\npersist, particularly the removal of populations from\r\nPalestinian territory, especially in and around Jerusalem.\r\nSuch brotherly countries as Syria have claimed that\r\nnegotiations should be continued at the point where they\r\nleft off and that Israel is required to withdraw fully from\r\nthe Golan Heights to the line of 4 June 1967 and from\r\nSouth Lebanon as far as West Bekaa.\r\nAs for cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe League of Arab States, we are working together to\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nsettle several issues that are very important to the future of\r\nthe Arab region. It is our hope that these joint efforts will\r\nbear fruit in the very near future and that the dreams and\r\ngoals of the peoples of the region will be fulfilled,\r\nparticularly the participation of Palestine as a full United\r\nNations Member State at the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly; the full lifting of sanctions imposed\r\nagainst our brother peoples in Libya and Iraq, in\r\ncompliance with resolutions of international legitimacy; the\r\nrestoration of peace and stability to Somalia and the\r\nComoros; the recovery by the United Arab Emirates of its\r\nfull sovereignty over the three occupied Arabian Gulf\r\nislands; and the establishment of the Middle East as a zone\r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nIn this respect, the role played by the League of Arab\r\nStates in support of the efforts of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of international peace and security has grown to the\r\nextent that the United Nations now relies on us, as a\r\nregional organization, in several areas. It is therefore\r\nessential that the League of Arab States should enjoy the\r\nsame full diplomatic status as other regional organizations\r\nworking under Chapter VIII of the Charter. It is clear that\r\nthe League of Arab States should enjoy the same status as\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity. Our acquisition of that\r\nstatus will make it much easier for us to do our work and\r\nto address practically the difficulties that arise in our day-\r\nto-day activities and responsibilities.\r\nFinally, we reiterate our support for the United\r\nNations, confident as we are of the nobility of the goals,\r\npurposes and principles of its Charter, and reaffirm our full\r\ncommitment to them. We again pledge our continued\r\nfruitful and constructive cooperation with the United\r\nNations in order to address the various common issues\r\nraised in the draft resolution before us. The consensus by\r\nwhich the draft resolution has advanced to this point\r\nreflects a universal recognition by the General Assembly of\r\npositive and effective cooperation with the League of Arab\r\nStates. We are also confident that this consensus can be\r\nextended to other resolutions on the Middle East, given the\r\nlegitimate positions and equally legitimate claims of the\r\nmembers of the League.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.14. I would inform members that the\r\nComoros and Iraq have become additional co-sponsors.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.14?\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.14 was adopted (resolution\r\n54/9).\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Israel, who wishes to speak in\r\nexplanation of vote on the resolution just adopted.\r\nMay I remind members that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes.\r\nMr. Gilon (Israel): The delegation of Israel has\r\njoined the consensus on the resolution for the sixth time\r\nin a row. In so doing, we were guided by the desire to\r\nmake peace with our neighbours, all of which are\r\nmembers of the League of Arab States.\r\nToday, significant strides have been taken on the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian track and we see new hope for progress\r\non the Syrian track as well. The peace process, which\r\nbegan in Madrid in 1991, was after all based on two\r\ntracks: the bilateral tracks between Israel and its\r\nneighbours and the multilateral tracks. We call upon our\r\nneighbours to seize the opportunity to quickly resume the\r\nmultilateral tracks, lest we lose the diplomatic momentum\r\nof the present day and the chance to bring the fruits of\r\npeace to our peoples. Hesitation and preconditions serve\r\nno one; face-to-face dialogue and cooperation are in the\r\ninterest of all parties in the region.\r\nIsrael supports cooperation between the United\r\nNations and various regional organizations, including the\r\nLeague of Arab States. Indeed, such cooperation is based\r\non provisions of the United Nations Charter. It is\r\nregrettable that Israel alone remains excluded from the\r\nregional group fitting its geographic location, owing to the\r\npolitical objections of some Member States. Israel calls\r\nupon the members of the League of Arab States to honour\r\nIsrael’s equal right to participate in the Group of Asian\r\nStates. The fact that Israel alone is still denied\r\nmembership in any regional group directly contradicts the\r\nUnited Nations declared commitment to the sovereign\r\nequality of Member States, enshrined in the Charter.\r\nThis is the first resolution on an issue related to the\r\nMiddle East to be adopted by the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fourth session. We are pleased that the resolution\r\nwas adopted by consensus.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nWe would therefore — especially after listening to the\r\nprevious speaker — take this opportunity to recommend\r\nthat all parties to the peace process exercise restraint both\r\nin the language of resolutions to be submitted and in all\r\nrelated statements. We cannot build confidence in the\r\nMiddle East by engaging in polemical debates in New\r\nYork. The peace process is by its nature bilateral between\r\nthe parties and inflammatory rhetoric offered in\r\ninternational forums surely belongs to another era.\r\nWe regret having to echo a plea so similar to last\r\nyear’s. This is due to the failure of this forum to reflect\r\nsubstantive changes on the ground. We look forward to a\r\nday when the climate in the United Nations will catch up\r\nwith the fact that a genuine peace process has been\r\nlaunched and that all sides have been moving towards\r\nprogress and reconciliation.\r\nBy resolving today to promote, in word and in deed,\r\nan atmosphere of cooperation and growth in the region, the\r\nnations involved in the peace process can transform today’s\r\nhope into tomorrow’s reality. Let us hope they do not miss\r\nthis historic opportunity.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 26?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 171\r\nObserver status for the Community of Portuguese-\r\nSpeaking Countries in the General Assembly\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.15)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nAngola to introduce draft resolution A/54/L.15.\r\nMr. Van Dunem “Mbinda” (Angola): On 7 October\r\nthe General Committee acceded to the request made by the\r\nPortuguese-speaking countries that are United Nations\r\nMembers to include a new item on the General Assembly’s\r\nagenda at this session on the granting of observer status to\r\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP).\r\nToday I take the floor on behalf of Angola, Brazil,\r\nCape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and Sao\r\nTome and Principe, in my capacity as Chairman of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers of the CPLP, to propose to this body\r\nthe adoption of draft resolution A/54/L.15, which invites the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries to\r\nparticipate in the sessions and the work of the General\r\nAssembly in the capacity of observer and requests the\r\nSecretary-General to take the necessary steps to\r\nimplement that decision.\r\nIn document A/54/232, of 14 September 1999, an\r\nexplanatory memorandum was circulated that describes\r\nthe history of the CPLP since its establishment on 17 July\r\n1996 as an intergovernmental body of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking countries to provide a response to the aspirations\r\nand appeals of 200 million people who consider the\r\nPortuguese language not only a means of communication,\r\nbut also a historical and a common heritage nurtured by\r\ntheir friendly relation throughout the centuries.\r\nThe Community, created by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the seven Portuguese-speaking countries,\r\nis determined to achieve the following goals: to contribute\r\nto the reinforcement of human ties, solidarity and\r\nbrotherhood among all people for whom the Portuguese\r\nlanguage is one of the pillars of their identity; to\r\nencourage the dissemination and the enrichment of the\r\nPortuguese language; to enhance the cultural exchange\r\nand dissemination of intellectual and artistic creation\r\nwithin the framework of the Portuguese language; to\r\nendeavour to establish in certain member countries\r\nconcrete forms of cooperation between the Portuguese\r\nlanguage and other national languages in the field of\r\nresearch and enhancement; to widen the cooperation\r\namong member countries in the field of political and\r\ndiplomatic concerted action, particularly within the\r\nframework of international organizations, so as to give\r\never greater expression of their common interests and\r\nneeds within the international community; to develop\r\neconomic and entrepreneurial cooperation among member\r\ncountries; and to mobilize internal and external efforts\r\nand resources aimed at assisting in reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation programmes, as well as humanitarian aid\r\nand emergency actions in member countries.\r\nThe CPLP also has among its objectives the\r\npromotion of cooperation in the following areas: the\r\npreservation of the environment; the protection of human\r\nrights, including the rights of children; strengthening of\r\nthe social and economic condition of women; and the\r\neradication of racism, racial discrimination and\r\nxenophobia.\r\nThe CPLP is very open with regard to national\r\ndiversity and cultural richness among its member States,\r\nwhich also belong to a multitude of other regional and\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nmultilateral bodies. Some of our countries are also members\r\nof the Organization of African Unity, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, the European Union, the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference, the Commonwealth and the\r\nInternational Organization of La Francophonie. We ardently\r\ndesire that at the dawn of the next millennium, East Timor\r\nwill join our Community as an independent Asian country,\r\nwell integrated into its own regional neighbourhood.\r\nAware of the cultural reality that an identity of their\r\nown confers upon its members, the CPLP is also meant to\r\nbe a bridge among the different geographical areas where\r\nits member States lie. By forming an association, they wish\r\nto promote peace, democracy, the rule of law, development,\r\nsocial justice and respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of States and for the principle of non-interference\r\nin internal affairs. In that way, they concur with the\r\npromotion of the purposes and principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nSince its inception, the CPLP has sought to cooperate\r\nefficiently and constructively with the United Nations and\r\nother relevant regional and subregional organizations. This\r\nhas been the case in the search for solutions to the war in\r\nAngola, in the recent crisis in Guinea-Bissau and in the\r\nprocess of self-determination of East Timor. In the case of\r\nGuinea-Bissau, it should be noted that the concerted action\r\nbetween the CPLP and the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States contributed much to the re-establishment of\r\npeace in that member country. The CPLP took part in the\r\nround table sponsored by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme aimed at coordinating the much-needed\r\nassistance for the rehabilitation process in Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThe CPLP is also taking the necessary steps to cooperate in\r\nthe reconstruction of East Timor.\r\nRecognizing the benefits that would stem from a\r\ncloser relationship with the United Nations, the Council of\r\nMinisters of the CPLP decided, at their meeting of July\r\n1998, held in Praia, Cape Verde, that the Community would\r\ntake the necessary steps in order to be granted observer\r\nstatus in the General Assembly. It is the hope of the seven\r\nmember States of the CPLP that the General Assembly will\r\ntransform our endeavour into reality by adopting draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.15.\r\nI would like to announce the additional sponsors of the\r\ndraft resolution: Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nMozambique, Portugal and Sao Tome and Principe.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take\r\na decision on draft resolution A/54/L.15.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.15?\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.15 was adopted (resolution\r\n54/10).\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Brazil.\r\nMr. Soares (Brazil): I have the privilege of\r\nexpressing the appreciation of the seven member States of\r\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP)\r\n— Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nMozambique, Portugal and Sao Tome and Principe — to\r\nthe other 181 Members of the United Nations for\r\naccepting the request to grant our Community observer\r\nstatus at the General Assembly.\r\nThe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries\r\nis not foreign to this Hall. Two years ago, on United\r\nNations Day, three Portuguese-language music stars —\r\nTito Paris of Cape Verde, Dulce Pontes of Portugal and\r\nCarlinhos Brown of Brazil — presented a show on behalf\r\nof the CPLP. On that occasion, the President of Brazil,\r\nFernando Henrique Cardoso, sent a message stating that\r\nthe CPLP was to be seen as an extension of the\r\ninternational personality of its seven member nations,\r\nwhich bring their shared historical heritage into the\r\npresent in the form of joint political action and a quest for\r\ncooperation.\r\nBringing together peoples from Africa, America,\r\nEurope and soon Asia, our Community is inspired by\r\ndemocratic principles. As the Permanent Representative\r\nof Angola stated, the CPLP statutes reaffirm the ideals of\r\nuniversal cooperation expressed in the San Francisco\r\nCharter. Hence, the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries was constituted in the light of the values of\r\npeace, democracy, rule of law, human rights, development\r\nand social justice, bearing in mind the principles of\r\nsovereign equality of States, non-interference in their\r\ninternal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 26 October 1999\r\nNot only do the main goals of CPLP share the\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter, but the values that\r\nconstitute the framework of the Community of Portuguese-\r\nSpeaking Countries are also consistent with the principles\r\nof this universal Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration\r\nof agenda item 171?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
