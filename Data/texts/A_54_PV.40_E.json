(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 99\r\nSustainable development and international economic\r\ncooperation\r\n(h) Implementation of the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.18)\r\nThe President: This morning the General Assembly,\r\nin accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary\r\nmeeting on 17 September 1999, is holding the\r\ncommemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the\r\noperations of the United Nations Population Fund.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: We are here today to register the\r\nmany successes achieved in the field of population and\r\ndevelopment policies of States and the contributions made\r\nby the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) since its\r\nestablishment in 1969.\r\nIn the 30 years of UNFPA\u0027s work, countries have\r\nmade appreciable progress in understanding population\r\nissues and in undertaking measures to find solutions. This\r\nis the result of the unstinting labour of thousands of women\r\nand men all over the world, especially in the developing\r\ncountries. These people have worked tirelessly to improve\r\nhealth care, raise educational standards, especially of rural\r\nwomen and girls, and introduce population and\r\ndevelopment policies. Their efforts have reduced the toll\r\nof poor health and improved the quality of life for the\r\npeople.\r\nBetter health and education mean more and wider\r\nchoices. Everyone has the right to reproductive health,\r\nand today more and more people are able to exercise this\r\nright. This in turn will result in smaller families and\r\nslower population growth. Health education and\r\npopulation policies are now effectively included in public\r\npolicy discussions and development plans.\r\nThe historic 1994 Cairo International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development was a watershed and a\r\npathfinder for a new approach. The gathering itself was\r\nunprecedented, while the decisions and the final\r\nProgramme of Action opened up new opportunities for\r\nintegrated development strategies for Governments and\r\ncitizens of the world. This commitment to the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action was further illustrated at the\r\nGeneral Assembly\u0027s special session in June last, when,\r\nafter five years of action, 185 countries reaffirmed their\r\nsupport for the Cairo decisions and added new\r\nbenchmarks for its continued implementation.\r\nThe focus of population challenges has shifted from\r\ncontroversy to consensus in the span of UNFPA\u0027s 30\r\nyears. The Fund\u0027s practical contribution is visible in many\r\nparts of the world. It is helping to build integrated\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nreproductive health programmes, enlarge partnerships and\r\npromote full recognition of women\u0027s rights and their\r\ncontribution to development. Women have asserted\r\nthemselves into the mainstream of development, and their\r\nvoices are being heard as never before in the corridors of\r\ngovernment and business, in professions and in other key\r\nareas of human activity. These are all important\r\nachievements, and they are due to UNFPA’s leadership and\r\ninitiatives. UNFPA has worked hard to ensure that its\r\nprogrammes and projects become locally owned and\r\nmanaged by the beneficiaries themselves. Working closely\r\nwith Governments, parliaments and non-governmental\r\norganizations, UNFPA has developed a workable\r\nrelationship of trust and mutual cooperation. With the\r\npassage of time, population management has become\r\nwidely accepted as an element in development planning.\r\nThe sharing of experiences and mutual support have further\r\nenhanced UNFPA’s activities.\r\nRecent national and international events marking the\r\nday on which the 6 billionth human being was born on\r\nplanet Earth illustrated that the international community is\r\ntoday concerned not merely with numbers but with\r\nindividual human lives in trying to balance population\r\ngrowth with economic growth. This is in line with the\r\nmessage of the 1994 Cairo Conference that population\r\nissues and development strategies affect equally individual,\r\nnational and global interests. Today, it is possible to\r\nacknowledge population growth as a factor influencing\r\ndevelopment. Moreover, countries can deal with population\r\nincrease, together with matching demographic issues, such\r\nas migration and ageing, as part of an integrated population\r\npolicy. Countries can now give due priority, in all aspects\r\nof their development policy, to reproductive health care,\r\nincluding family planning, as part of an integrated health-\r\ncare system; to education for women and girls, as part of an\r\nintegrated education service; and to gender issues.\r\nToday countries can allocate the needed resources to\r\nthese and other aspects of social development without\r\nrisking public criticism for misappropriating funds and\r\nresources. At the same time, international institutions are\r\nnow beginning to understand better the role of health,\r\neducation and gender factors in national development and\r\nare prepared to support them. Today we have a clear idea\r\nof what our social development goals are and what it will\r\ntake in the form of national and international resources to\r\nachieve them.\r\nOn the question of resources, it is important to\r\nrecognize those private foundations which have given so\r\ngenerously to promote international population and\r\ndevelopment goals. In this context, major corporations\r\nhave recently made significant contributions or have\r\npledged to do so. We commend them for this and urge\r\nothers to emulate their wonderful example.\r\nMs. Nafis Sadik, Executive Director of UNFPA, has\r\nearned a global reputation as an untiring crusader for\r\ninternational understanding of and support for population\r\nissues, particularly as regards gender equality. She is\r\nknown for her strong views and her forthright way of\r\nexpressing them. At the same time, she has earned respect\r\nand admiration as a diplomat and a consensus builder.\r\nThis is the kind of leadership that the international\r\ncommunity must demonstrate in tackling the social issues\r\non UNFPA’s agenda. In doing so, it must ensure that\r\nsuch efforts do not ignore respect for the human rights of\r\nall the world’s 6 billion people, as well as the national\r\ninterests of States.\r\nI now give the floor to Ms. Nafis Sadik, Executive\r\nDirector of the United Nations Population Fund, to deliver\r\na statement on behalf of the Secretary-General.\r\nMs. Sadik (United Nations Population Fund): I am\r\nvery honoured to read the following message from the\r\nSecretary-General to the General Assembly on the\r\noccasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the operations of\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\r\n“Thirty years ago, my predecessor, U Thant,\r\ntransferred a small trust fund to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme. A small group of donors\r\nprovided a small amount of money for the new\r\nfund’s operations. Such were the modest beginnings\r\nof what we know we today as the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund — one of the leading success\r\nstories of the United Nations of the last half century.\r\n“Many here will recall how delicate and\r\nsensitive population issues were in the 1960s. It was\r\nhard to agree even on a basis for discussion. Of\r\ncourse, the United Nations Population Division had\r\nbeen in existence since 1945. But there was great\r\ncontroversy over whether the United Nations should\r\ntake a leading part in action on population, and if so,\r\nwhat it should do.\r\n“Controversy may have abated only somewhat\r\nsince then, but 30 years have also brought a long\r\nrecord of achievement. That success has been built\r\non three pillars: good information, good programmes\r\nand good understanding. When UNFPA started\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nwork, most developing countries had only rudimentary\r\nsystems for collecting and analysing population data\r\nas a basis for policy. UNFPA has worked with the\r\nPopulation Division and with the Statistical Unit of the\r\nUnited Nations to build national statistical offices, take\r\ncensuses, make projections and disseminate reliable\r\ndata. This has meant significant increases in national\r\ncapacities to plan ahead, to incorporate population\r\npolicies into development planning and to take sound\r\neconomic and social decisions.\r\n“UNFPA has also been a close partner in helping\r\ndeveloping countries put in place effective\r\nprogrammes for voluntary family planning and\r\nintegrated reproductive health programmes. When\r\ncoupled with economic growth, improved education\r\nfor women and girls and other factors, the result has\r\nbeen a decline in the average number of children per\r\nfamily from six to three during the 30 years of\r\nUNFPA’s efforts. This in turn has meant better care\r\nfor children; more choices for women; decreased\r\npressure on the environment; slower, more balanced\r\npopulation growth; and better living standards in\r\ngeneral.\r\n“And then, of course, there was the breakthrough\r\nat Cairo: the historic consensus reached at the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment five years ago on the global need for\r\nslower population growth overall, on the national right\r\nto sovereign decision-making and on the individual\r\nright to reproductive health. The special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly just four months ago showed that\r\nMember States remain committed to the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action. We must build on this political\r\nwill.\r\n“The success of UNFPA is also a success for the\r\nUnited Nations process: the painstaking work of\r\ndebating proposals, airing differences and, finally,\r\nachieving political consensus. This is the harmonizing\r\nrole of the United Nations as envisaged in its founding\r\nCharter. Combined with our operational programmes,\r\nit is the path of real progress.\r\n“All Member States, and all parts of the United\r\nNations system, have contributed. UNFPA has been\r\nvery effective in forming alliances within and outside\r\nthe United Nations system; this has led to greater\r\ncohesion and better use of resources. UNFPA was also\r\nquick to realize the indispensable role of civil society,\r\nand has worked closely with non-governmental\r\norganizations, north and south, as well as with the\r\nprivate sector.\r\n“I wish I could say that all problems have been\r\nsolved, but you know as well as I do that there is\r\none area where performance has been lacking. If we\r\ncould mobilize the resources envisaged at Cairo, we\r\nwould be in a much better position to attain the\r\nprogress we seek.\r\n“Life would be unrecognizable without\r\ndifficulties to overcome. So we shall continue our\r\nwork on an issue that has individual, national and\r\nglobal repercussions. We shall persist in our struggle\r\nfor the development of nations and the human rights\r\nof people. And we shall continue looking to UNFPA\r\nfor its renowned leadership, advocacy and\r\nprogrammes.\r\n“In that spirit, I would like to salute UNFPA,\r\nits dynamic Executive Director, Dr. Nafis Sadik, her\r\npredecessor, the late Rafael Salas, and UNFPA staff\r\nall over the world for the great service they have\r\nrendered humankind.”\r\nThe President: I call now on the representative of\r\nBurkina Faso, who will speak on behalf of the Group of\r\nAfrican States.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): The\r\nAssembly\u0027s consideration of agenda item 99 (h),\r\n“Sustainable development and international economic\r\ncooperation: implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nof the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment”, gives us this opportunity to commemorate\r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the operations of the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA). In the life of an\r\nundertaking or a programme, 30 years is the age of full\r\nmaturity. This means we must look back not only to\r\nassess what progress has been achieved, but also to see\r\nwhether all the efforts, all the work, have lived up to our\r\nexpectations and have achieved the results for which we\r\nhad hoped.\r\nWe believe that on the whole the record of UNFPA\r\nis a positive one, even if diverse obstacles and constraints\r\nhave sometimes hampered progress, complicated efforts\r\nand even given rise to doubt.\r\nWith respect to Africa, the challenges seem\r\nenormous, starting with the very issues involved. Africa\r\nis the continent where controlling population growth has\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nposed the most daunting challenge, for many reasons from\r\npsychological resistance to a lack of acceptance of family-\r\nplanning methods. The result is that uncontrollable and\r\nuncontrolled population growth constantly challenges\r\neconomic projections and thus thwarts all our efforts. The\r\nUnited Nations has signalled the overriding importance of\r\npopulation and its impact on the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa by including it as a priority area in\r\nthe United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\r\nAfrica.\r\nMoreover, the world economic situation itself is not\r\nconducive to investment in social areas, to the point where\r\na prominent United Nations economist has said that this\r\ncentury is ending with a crisis of development — and, we\r\nmight well add, with a crisis of international solidarity. The\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development has\r\nrecently reported that, in 1998, countries of the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\nsaved $60 billion by paying less for commodities. Of\r\ncourse, that sum, levied on the poor, exceeds what the rich\r\nnations spend on official development assistance.\r\nIn addition to these more or less external factors, there\r\nare also purely African internal considerations, such as\r\ninter-State and inter-ethnic conflict; in his report on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (S/1998/318), the\r\nSecretary-General stressed the harmful effect of this on\r\nAfrican development. Other factors include: low levels of\r\neducation; the still excessive marginalization of the most\r\nunderprivileged groups, such as women; meagre progress in\r\ndemocracy; underemployment of young people, who\r\nnonetheless constitute a most valuable workforce; refugee\r\nflows; along with other factors.\r\nThese negative considerations only put UNFPA\u0027s\r\nperformance in greater relief, since despite these pitfalls the\r\nFund has for 30 years been playing an irreplaceable role in\r\nproviding technical and financial assistance in many areas,\r\nin addition to its advocacy work. Above all, UNFPA has\r\nbeen mandated by the United Nations to follow up the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action of the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development in\r\n53 African countries, in cooperation with the operational\r\nsystem of the United Nations, regional institutions, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, civil society, et cetera. In\r\ncooperation with the Economic Commission for Africa,\r\nUNFPA has the responsibility of reviewing what has been\r\nachieved with respect to adolescent reproductive health, the\r\nadvancement of women, partnership with civil society and\r\nproblems such as economic difficulties, lack of qualified\r\npersonnel and the ineffectiveness of advocacy strategies.\r\nIt continues to help many African States to define and\r\nformulate their national population policies and strategies,\r\nand sometimes to revise them, in particular to take\r\naccount of goals recommended by the International\r\nConference on Population and Development.\r\nThese achievements have been made possible thanks\r\nto technical assistance teams at Dakar, Addis Ababa and\r\nHarare, and thanks also to the regional training institutes\r\nthat have helped most of these countries in national\r\ncapacity-building with a view to implementing their\r\npopulation and development policies.\r\nSimilarly, UNFPA supports the activities of regional\r\nand subregional organizations in this sphere. In\r\ncooperation with the Permanent Inter-State Committee on\r\nDrought Control in the Sahel, UNFPA has helped in\r\ncreating an information-management system to monitor\r\nmaternal mortality, the use of contraception and the\r\nimplementation of population and migration programmes\r\nin the sub-Sahel region. In cooperation with the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), the Fund has\r\nalso been engaged in preparatory work for the census\r\nplanned for 2001 in the 14 countries members of the\r\nCommunity.\r\nThe great progress made is illustrated by\r\nachievements including: the adoption of laws against\r\nfemale genital mutilation in countries such as Ghana,\r\nTogo, Benin, Côte d\u0027Ivoire, Senegal and Burkina Faso;\r\nthe implementation in many countries of new health\r\npolicies relating particularly to reproductive health for\r\nyoung people and adolescents; and the promotion of\r\nwomen\u0027s rights, in particular to combat discrimination and\r\nviolence. Here, we should stress that UNFPA has set up\r\nan African women\u0027s network, the goal of which is to\r\npromote implementation of the Programme of Action of\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and the Beijing Platform for Action.\r\nMembers of this group, who meet every two years, have\r\nbecome important allies in promoting reproductive health\r\nrights, gender equality and for the mobilization of\r\nresources to implement national population programmes.\r\nThe Fund furthermore supports the Forum of African and\r\nArab Parliamentarians on population and development.\r\nFinally, among UNFPA\u0027s achievements we must highlight\r\nits activities in raising awareness, in particular about\r\nHIV/AIDS prevention.\r\nThirty-seven African countries out of 61 group-A\r\ncountries still need UNFPA to attain the goals of the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development. For a long time to come,\r\nUNFPA will be essential to our continent, which is\r\neloquent testimony to its usefulness and, above all, of its\r\neffectiveness. This is why we urgently appeal to beneficiary\r\ncountries, to donors and to the entire international\r\ncommunity to increase financial resources for the Fund so\r\nthat it can properly and effectively discharge its mission.\r\nIf this appeal is heeded, it will be the best gift that we\r\ncan offer to Ms. Nafis Sadik and her associates, to whom\r\nwe pay sincere tribute for the high quality of the work they\r\nhave done and to whom we would like to say “happy\r\nbirthday”.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nUzbekistan, who will speak on behalf of the Group of\r\nAsian States.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan): Today we celebrate the\r\nthirtieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA). I would like to take this\r\nexcellent opportunity to express my gratitude to Ms. Nafis\r\nSadik, the Executive Director of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund, for her tireless efforts and for her broad\r\ninsight into the process of solving problems of population.\r\nThe history of the creation of the Fund has deep and\r\nstrong roots in the United Nations system. For the past\r\nthree decades the discussion of problems of population has\r\nbecome an inalienable part of the global dialogue on issues\r\nof economic and social development. In each country, it has\r\nbecome a part of the process of formulating political\r\ndecisions in the field of planning. Issues of assistance to\r\nStates and the creation of development strategy in the field\r\nof population have been incorporated in the Fund\u0027s\r\nfunctions and tasks since the moment of its creation in\r\n1969.\r\nIt is necessary to note that enormous changes have\r\ntaken place since the end of 1960s: for instance, significant\r\ngrowth in the scale of assistance for childbirth and a sharp\r\nreduction in population growth rates, the level of birth rates\r\nand the size of families. The success over the three\r\nprevious decades has been a result of the political will of\r\nnations, international information activities, and the joint\r\nand coordinated efforts of countries and donors, as well as\r\nof the UNFPA and other United Nations agencies.\r\nI wish also to note the innovative approach of the\r\nFund, including its search for new aspects of cooperation in\r\nthe field of development and the attraction of financial\r\nsupport from non-governmental sources. This should,\r\nundoubtedly, serve as a model for other international\r\norganizations.\r\nOver the past three decades, Governments of a\r\nnumber of countries have managed, thanks in most cases\r\nto the active assistance of the Fund, to lower the\r\nparameters of child and maternal death, to improve\r\nindicators of life expectancy and to increase the number\r\nof children attending elementary and high schools.\r\nThe Programme of Action adopted by consensus at\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment (ICPD), held in Cairo, has become a\r\nsignificant event in a history of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nDuring the process of implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action, countries members of the Asian\r\nGroup have carried out and continue to carry out efforts\r\nto improve their policies and programmes in the field of\r\npopulation and development, consistent with the\r\nprovisions of the Programme and in view of their\r\nparticular demographic, socio-economic and political\r\nsituations. It is worth mentioning that since the day of the\r\napproval of the Programme of Action, Asian countries\r\nhave always maintained a political adherence to the goals\r\nof the Programme.\r\nIt is necessary to note that financial and economic\r\nshocks, natural disasters and local wars and conflicts\r\ncreate obstacles in the process of achieving the objectives\r\nof the Programme of Action. It is widely recognized that\r\nsafe maternity is both a factor for development and an\r\nimperative factor for the protection of human rights. Rates\r\nof maternal and child death in some countries of the\r\nAsian region, however, remain high due to the adverse\r\neconomic situation of women, the absence of access to\r\nmaternity services and insufficient access to services for\r\nthe protection of reproductive health and for family\r\nplanning.\r\nCountries of the region are also concerned by the\r\nexpansion of the practice of smuggling migrants,\r\nespecially women and children, who are exposed to\r\nviolence, to compulsory work and to sexual exploitation.\r\nThe assistance of the UNFPA appears to be most valuable\r\nfor completing the long and difficult process of solving\r\nproblems, as well as in reviewing previous programmes\r\nand projects of the Fund and developing new ones within\r\nthe framework of ICPD + 5. Establishment of\r\nmechanisms for partnership of the Fund with other\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nrelevant bodies of the United Nations system and\r\ninternational intergovernmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations has become an important achievement of the\r\nFund.\r\nCountries members of the Asian Group welcome the\r\npositive contribution made by the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund and its personnel over the years to solving\r\nproblems of population and development, and we\r\ncongratulate the Fund and its staff on the occasion of the\r\nthirtieth anniversary of its operations and wish them further\r\nsuccess in the achievement of the tasks before them.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to recall that the\r\ncommemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the\r\noperations of the United Nations Population Fund coincides\r\nwith two remarkable events: the approach of a new\r\nmillennium and the birth of the 6 billionth citizen of our\r\nplanet. The symbolic and joyful concurrence of events\r\nshould encourage all of us to make more active and\r\neffective efforts to ensure that current and future\r\ngenerations will enjoy a brighter future, free from the\r\ncurrent problems challenging the international community.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nBulgaria, who will speak on behalf of the Eastern European\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Sotirov (Bulgaria): It is truly a privilege to speak\r\non behalf of the Group of Eastern European States on this\r\nsignificant occasion: the commemoration of the thirtieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA).\r\nThe last year of the twentieth century is a special year\r\nfor population issues. In July the General Assembly held its\r\nspecial session for the review and appraisal of the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted at the International\r\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo. On\r\n12 October the 6 billionth citizen of our planet was born.\r\nToday we are marking the thirtieth anniversary of the\r\ncreation of UNFPA.\r\nDespite the limited funds made available to it, UNFPA\r\nis now an international development agency with a broad\r\nmandate: to raise awareness of population issues throughout\r\nthe world and, especially, to assist developing countries and\r\ncountries with economies in transition in solving their\r\npopulation problems.\r\nUnder the leadership of Ms. Nafis Sadik the United\r\nNations Population Fund has become the undisputed\r\ninternational leader in the population field, leading the\r\ndrive towards the goals agreed at the International\r\nConference on Population and Development in 1994. We\r\nbelieve that the key to UNFPA\u0027s success is its careful\r\nattention and quick response to national needs and\r\npriorities, as well as its close working relationships with\r\nGovernments and civil society.\r\nSince it became operational the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund has had a profound effect on national\r\nattitudes towards population issues, helping bring\r\npopulation issues into the mainstream of development\r\npolicy. Governments are increasingly integrating sectoral\r\ndevelopment efforts, forming permanent inter-agency\r\ndevelopment teams that work consistently together. This\r\napproach has been extended to international assistance;\r\nmany countries have established mechanisms to avoid\r\nduplication and promote rational use of resources.\r\nUNFPA\u0027s approach has also promoted cooperation at the\r\ncountry level within the United Nations system.\r\nActivities and programmes at the regional level, in\r\nparticular in the Eastern European region, have\r\ndemonstrated the efficiency of UNFPA\u0027s operations. We\r\nhope that the United Nations Population Fund will\r\ncontinue to render strong support to the endeavours of the\r\nGovernments of the region to solve the specific\r\npopulation problems.\r\nAt the international level, UNFPA has helped\r\npromote understanding and awareness on what needs to\r\nbe done in the field of population and development.\r\nDevising an appropriate population policy is now\r\naccepted globally as part of a sound development strategy\r\nand is increasingly seen to be part of the foundation of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nAlthough much remains to be done, UNFPA\u0027s\r\nsuccess speaks for itself. Nearly 60 per cent of women in\r\ndeveloping countries now have access to reproductive\r\nhealth services, including family planning. As a result,\r\nfertility is falling and population growth rates are slowing\r\nin all parts of the developing world.\r\nNow, on the verge of a new millennium, the United\r\nNations Population Fund is in the process of updating its\r\nprogrammes to reflect the new international consensus on\r\nreproductive health, women\u0027s empowerment and\r\neducation. We hope that UNFPA will continue\r\nsuccessfully to revitalize itself in order to become a\r\nmodel international institution. We wish it a happy\r\nanniversary.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nPeru, who will speak on behalf of the Latin America and\r\nCaribbean States.\r\nMr. Picasso (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): The Peruvian\r\ndelegation, on behalf of the Group of Latin America and\r\nCaribbean States, would like to hail and recognize the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund\u0027s successful first 30 years\r\nof existence.\r\nThree decades ago the international community had\r\nonly a nascent understanding of population issues and of\r\nthe effect of these issues on the welfare of individuals.\r\nThus, it is important to note that the Population Fund\r\nperformed an educational and at the same time enlightening\r\nrole by promoting the subject of population as a\r\nmultidimensional issue and, consequently, by emphasizing\r\nthe need to deal with these issues from several angles.\r\nIn 1994 the international community defined a\r\nprogramme of action that was based on a broad\r\ninternational consensus. The Cairo Programme of Action\r\nemphasizes the need to assign priority to improving the\r\nquality of life and well-being of the population of the\r\nworld; promoting human development in order to eliminate\r\npoverty; supporting sustained economic growth within the\r\nframework of sustainable development; ensuring access to\r\neducation, particularly for girls; promoting gender equality\r\nand equity; reducing infant and maternal mortality;\r\nreproductive health services; the search for sustainable\r\nproduction and consumption patterns; and the development\r\nof human resources. All of these efforts were to be\r\nundertaken within a framework of respect for human rights.\r\nThe five-year review of the Cairo Programme of\r\nAction was successfully concluded with the support of the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States participated actively in this\r\nprocess and are deeply satisfied with the outcome of the\r\nreview. They have also embarked on a study of the\r\nrecommendations in order to implement them.\r\nThe countries of our region are undoubtedly now in\r\ngood shape to implement the Cairo agreements. Observing\r\nthe events of the past century from a historical perspective,\r\nall delegations present here will agree that important\r\nprogress has been made in the living conditions of most\r\ncountries of the Latin American and Caribbean region.\r\nSignificant social and economic transformations have\r\nproduced relatively sustained rates of economic growth and\r\nsome improvement in the well-being of individuals and the\r\ndelivery of basic social services. Moreover, the sustained\r\naccess of the population to education and the\r\nincorporation of women into the labour market have led\r\nto marked changes in family patterns.\r\nMost programmes in our countries acknowledge\r\ninstitutional reinforcement and the decentralization of\r\ntheir services as a priority measure in the application of\r\nreproductive health services. Many countries have\r\nincorporated new actors, acknowledging the work of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, particularly those for women\r\nand young people, and the rest of civil society. There has\r\nalso been recognition of the new principles on\r\nreproductive rights outlined in Cairo and of the need to\r\nsupply access to quality services.\r\nThe various levels of poverty include ethnic and\r\ngender differences, which are also reflected in limited\r\naccess to basic health and education services. The\r\nindicators reflect the reality of life for women. Fifty per\r\ncent of Latin American and Caribbean women have\r\nsuffered some kind of domestic violence; fewer than 50\r\nper cent of births in the Central American and Andean\r\narea countries are attended by trained personnel; maternal\r\nmortality rates remain high within the region, pointing to\r\nmarked social, economic and gender inequalities that\r\npersist within the region.\r\nThe situation of our youth is also worrying. In some\r\ncountries, adolescents make up more than 50 per cent of\r\nthe total population. One third of all girls under the age\r\nof 20 have already had their first child; they are thus\r\nunable to finish their schooling or obtain adequate\r\ntraining and are doomed to the perpetuation of their social\r\ncondition and to seriously restricted opportunities for\r\ndevelopment. In reality, many youthful pregnancies occur\r\nas a reaction to the reality of unemployment and the\r\nlimited economic opportunities for individual progress. It\r\nis obvious that teenagers need special care commensurate\r\nwith their needs.\r\nThere is a clear commitment in Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean to continued implementation of the\r\nresolutions adopted at the 1994 International Conference\r\non Population and Development. The achievements made\r\nto date prove that the financing of programmes within the\r\nregion has concrete results, since they have produced a\r\ncontext of greater political and economic stability than in\r\nthe previous decades.\r\nAlthough these achievements have been meaningful,\r\nit is important to emphasize that the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean situation requires the sustained technical and\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\neconomic support of the international community. We\r\ntherefore take this opportunity to acknowledge and\r\ncommend the work of the Population Fund, as well as that\r\nof the international donor community. In this same\r\nconviction, we repeat our request for increased support\r\nfrom the donors for the region generally and for population\r\naffairs specifically.\r\nWithin this framework, it is important to support and\r\nto be able to count on the cooperation of the Population\r\nFund, so that it may continue to work with regional\r\nGovernments and civil society, in accordance with its\r\nmandate, and to improve the quality of life of our peoples,\r\nparticularly women, adolescents and young girls.\r\nWe are convinced that, in the twenty-first century, the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund will continue actively to\r\nexercise its role in making the Cairo Programme of Action\r\na reality. We in the Latin American and Caribbean region\r\nwish it the greatest success and pledge to continue to\r\nstrengthen its links of cooperation with our countries. In\r\nthis way, we may one day be able to claim in full\r\nsatisfaction that every family lives in an environment that\r\nis conducive to its well-being and development and enables\r\nit to freely organize its own living conditions in accordance\r\nwith its perceptions and individual situation, within a\r\nframework of equity and equality for women and men and\r\nin full respect for human rights.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Italy, who will speak on behalf of the\r\nWestern European and Other States Group.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): 12 October 1999 marked the\r\ncrossing of a major threshold in human history: the birth of\r\nthe world\u0027s six billionth child. This extraordinary moment\r\ncompels us to reflect on the remarkable growth of the\r\nworld\u0027s population and on the collective responsibility of\r\nthe international community in seeking to stabilize this\r\nphenomenon. For the past 30 years — and, I am sure, for\r\nmany more in the future — we have been and will be able\r\nto count on the most invaluable work of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA), which has always remained in\r\nthe forefront on issues related to the field of population. On\r\nthis special occasion, it is my privilege to speak on behalf\r\nof the Western European and Other States Group, which\r\nwants to express its profound appreciation for the Fund\u0027s\r\nmission and achievements.\r\nUNFPA was established in 1967 as the United Nations\r\nTrust Fund for Population Activities. By the time of the\r\n1974 World Population Conference in Bucharest, it was\r\nalready acting globally. It was, however, at the Cairo\r\nConference of 1994 that the linkage between population\r\nand development was finally acknowledged.\r\nThe mission statement of UNFPA inscribes the\r\nlaudable goals of contributing to improving the quality of\r\nlife and stabilizing world population. In the field of\r\npopulation and development, UNFPA provides leadership\r\nand advocacy and, above all, helps Governments\r\nformulate and implement population policies and\r\nprogrammes. It supports developing countries by\r\nproviding practical development assistance, forging\r\npartnerships and mobilizing resources.\r\nUNFPA has played a remarkable role in helping\r\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\r\ntransition to implement population and development\r\nstrategies. It has also done commendable work in the\r\npopulation census area and in building capacities to\r\ncollect, process and maintain basic population data in\r\nprogramme countries.\r\nIn the implementation of its overall mission, UNFPA\r\nrecognizes that all human rights are universal, indivisible\r\nand interdependent. This is proclaimed in many\r\ninternational instruments, including the Vienna\r\nDeclaration on Human Rights, the Programmes of Action\r\nof the United Nations International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development and of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development and, last but not least, in the\r\nPlatform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen.\r\nThe Group of Western European and other States\r\ncannot but commend UNFPA for promoting the\r\nempowerment of women, gender equality, women’s\r\nreproductive health and rights and male responsibility.\r\nThe five-year review of the Cairo Programme of Action\r\nshowed that almost two thirds of the Member States have\r\nalready introduced policy or legislative measures to\r\npromote equity and equality of women in areas including\r\ninheritance, property rights, employment and protection\r\nfrom gender-based violence, such as female genital\r\nmutilation.\r\nAmong its many significant achievements, UNFPA\r\nhas helped combat the spread of HIV/AIDS and other,\r\nsimilar diseases, both through its own programmes and as\r\na sponsor of the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nThe countries of the Group of Western European and\r\nother States are committed to the goals of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action and support the implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action and of the key actions identified\r\nin the recent five-year review.\r\nI wish to close by thanking in particular Ms. Nafis\r\nSadik, the dynamic Executive Director of UNFPA, for her\r\nleadership and wisdom in the sensitive field of population\r\nand development. The Group of Western European and\r\nother States would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress its appreciation to the staff members of UNFPA all\r\nover the world for their dedication, hard work and\r\nconsiderable achievements.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of the\r\nUnited States of America, the host country.\r\nMs. King (United States of America): Over the past\r\n30 years an unshakable worldwide consensus has emerged\r\nthat underscores the integral and mutually reinforcing\r\nlinkages between population and development. For the first\r\ntime, Governments agreed that family planning,\r\nreproductive and sexual health, safe motherhood, healthy\r\nnewborns, support and guidance for youth and\r\nempowerment of women were closely linked to the\r\nprovision of adequate food, water, education, sanitation,\r\nshelter and other primary health services. This new\r\nconsensus replaced human numbers with human needs,\r\nreplaced coercion with choices and moved from a\r\ndemography-centred to a democracy-based approach to\r\nstabilizing global population growth. Behind this historic\r\nconsensus — indeed, acting as the vanguard of the global\r\npartnership that has grown out of this consensus — stands\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\r\nThe United States is proud of the role it played in the\r\nfounding of UNFPA in 1969. Over these 30 years, the work\r\nof UNFPA has been critical in ensuring that women and\r\ntheir families are at the heart of our collective economic,\r\nsocial and political development efforts. UNFPA has taken\r\nthe lead in expanding access to reproductive health services\r\nthroughout the world, in recognizing and upholding\r\nwomen’s fundamental rights and in forging progress in the\r\ncritical areas of maternal mortality, family planning and\r\nHIV/AIDS prevention.\r\nWith UNFPA’s support, Governments are doing a\r\nbetter job of meeting the needs of youth by developing\r\nand investing in plans that will ensure they will lead\r\nhealthy and productive lives. Because of UNFPA,\r\nGovernments are better able to build lasting partnerships\r\nwith non-governmental organizations; and thanks in large\r\nmeasure to UNFPA’s Herculean efforts, we have a\r\nplan — the United Nations International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development Programme of Action —\r\nagreed to by 179 Governments, that focuses on meeting\r\nthe needs of individual women and men and urges the\r\nempowerment of women both as a highly important end\r\nin itself and as a key to improving the quality of live for\r\neveryone.\r\nOn behalf of the United States Government, I want\r\nto congratulate Ms. Nafis Sadik for her visionary\r\nleadership of UNFPA over the past 12 years. She\r\ncontinues to be a tireless champion of reproductive rights\r\naround the world. We owe Ms. Sadik and the multitude\r\nof UNFPA staff members across the globe a debt of\r\ngratitude for all they have done over the past 30 years to\r\nplace women at the very centre of development. We\r\nsalute them and wish them all, and UNFPA, many, many\r\nhappy birthdays to come.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nGuyana to introduce the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/54/L.18.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): I am pleased, on the\r\noccasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA), to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/54/L.18 for the consideration of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-fourth session.\r\nAs can be seen from the long list of sponsors, the\r\ndocument enjoys widespread support among member\r\ncountries of the Group of 77 and other important\r\nconstituencies within the Assembly. I am pleased to\r\nannounce that, in addition to the names appearing on the\r\ndocument, the following countries have joined as\r\nsponsors: Algeria, Angola, Austria, Bangladesh, Bulgaria,\r\nChina, Cuba, Finland, France, Greece, India, Indonesia,\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, Portugal, the Republic of\r\nMoldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saint Lucia,\r\nSouth Africa, Tunisia and Venezuela. And I have no\r\ndoubt that by the end of this morning there will be many\r\nmore. This extensive endorsement is by no means\r\nsurprising, since the underlying purpose of the draft\r\nresolution is clear and uncontroversial. Quite simply, it\r\ncommends the significant achievements of UNFPA during\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nits three decades of existence in implementing the important\r\nareas of its mandate and calls for increased international\r\nsupport in furtherance of its activities in the years to come.\r\nMay I just point out that there is a small typographical\r\nerror appearing in the title: the world “operation” should be\r\nin the plural. The error recurs in operative paragraph 1,\r\nwhere the word “operation” should also be made plural.\r\nIn formally presenting the draft resolution to the\r\nAssembly, it is perhaps apropos to recall that five years ago\r\nin Cairo, the international community came together to call\r\nfor an action programme to address the challenges of\r\npopulation. The result was a set of firm objectives which all\r\nStates committed themselves to pursue in the interest of a\r\npeaceful, healthy and stable world. In demonstration of this\r\ncommitment, a pledge was made then to try to reach a\r\ntarget of $5.7 million dollars in the year 2000. The outcome\r\nof the meeting was a landmark in international cooperation\r\non issues that are admittedly sensitive and susceptible to\r\ndifferent perspectives and priorities.\r\nRegrettably, however, as was evident at the special\r\nsession to review the status of implementation of the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action, which was held some four months\r\nago with the Ambassador of Bangladesh ably and\r\neffectively chairing the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole,\r\nit does not appear likely that the targets set will be easily\r\nmet. Indeed, there is an anticipated shortfall of $3.5 million\r\nin contributions, resulting in a reduction of activities to a\r\nmere one third of those originally planned. By any\r\nyardstick, this cannot be deemed satisfactory.\r\nAs a consequence of this financing gap, to take just\r\none example, the target of providing basic education for all\r\nchildren by the year 2015 will elude us. So, too, down the\r\nline, as the heads of the multilateral financial institutions\r\nhave already told us, will the other social targets, the most\r\nimportant of which is to halve global poverty by the year\r\n2015. In the light of this setback, the international\r\ncommunity must seriously ask itself whether it is doing\r\nenough to address the many social ills that continue to\r\nplague it. For to fail to live up to commitments freely given\r\nis to place in doubt the value of the hard negotiations in\r\nwhich we continuously engage in the ostensible hope of\r\nfinding common solutions to common problems.\r\nAs the Secretary-General makes clear in his report on\r\nthe special session contained in document A/54/442 and the\r\nrecent debate within the Second Committee, population\r\nissues are at the heart of sustainable development. Health\r\nand education — particularly of women — are\r\nprerequisites for the creation of a vibrant and productive\r\nsociety. It is therefore essential that adequate attention and\r\nsupport be given to such important areas of reproductive\r\nand sexual health — including the needs of\r\nadolescents — as access to needed family planning,\r\nplanning services, reduction of maternal mortality rates\r\nand the creation of education and training services.\r\nThe sponsors of draft resolution A/54/L.18 are fully\r\nsatisfied that the United Nations, more particularly\r\nUNFPA, under the enthusiastic and enterprising leadership\r\nof Ms. Nafis Sadik, is dedicated to the full\r\nimplementation of the Cairo Programme of Action.\r\nHowever, to do its job, UNFPA must be provided, as\r\nMs. Sadik reminded us only yesterday, with adequate\r\nresources. With a gap of almost $5 billion between the\r\ncurrent commitments and the target of some $7 billion set\r\nfor 2015, UNFPA’s future can hardly be said to be fully\r\nassured.\r\nOn this occasion, therefore, when we meet to\r\ncelebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of\r\nUNFPA, we should also resolve to honour the obligations\r\nundertaken at Cairo. There can be no better birthday gift\r\nto UNFPA than a renewed pledge to raise the levels of\r\nfinancial support. With this appeal, I wish to convey to\r\nthe Fund, its Executive Director and its staff our warmest\r\ncongratulations and good wishes and to call for the\r\nunanimous adoption of draft resolution A/54/L.18, which\r\nformally places on record the Assembly’s appreciation of\r\nthe great work being done by the Fund in the cause of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/54/L.18, entitled “Thirtieth\r\nanniversary of the operations of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund”.\r\nSince the introduction of the draft resolution, Brazil\r\nand Cyprus have joined the list of sponsors.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.18?\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.18 was adopted (resolution\r\n54/11).\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 27 October 1999\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded the commemoration\r\nof the thirtieth anniversary of the operations of the United\r\nNations Population Fund and this stage of its consideration\r\nof sub-item (h) of agenda item 99.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.35 a.m.\r\n11\r\n"
