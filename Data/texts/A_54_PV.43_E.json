As my country believes in and practices\r\ndemocracy, and given the results of the previous round of\r\nballoting, we have decided to withdraw our candidacy. I\r\nwish, however, to express our profound gratitude to all\r\nfriendly countries that have been so committed to us up\r\nto this moment.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Thailand.\r\nMr. Jayanama (Thailand): I wish to inform the\r\nAssembly that Thailand wishes to withdraw its candidacy.\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 October 1999\r\nWe take this opportunity to thank all the delegations that\r\nhave supported us.

I request\r\nrepresentatives to use only those ballot papers and to write\r\non them the name of the one State for which they wish to\r\nvote. Ballot papers bearing more than one name will be\r\ndeclared invalid. Ballot papers bearing the name of a State\r\nfrom outside the relevant region will not be counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Ioseliani\r\n(Georgia), Mr. Sengmanothong (Lao People\u0027s\r\nDemocratic Republic), Ms. Arias (Peru), Mr. Nyman\r\n(Sweden) and Mr. Ben Youssef (Tunisia) acted as\r\ntellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 6.10 p.m. and resumed\r\nat 6.30 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as follows:\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 159\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 158\r\nAbstentions: 7\r\nNumber of members voting: 151\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 101\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMexico 145\r\nUruguay 4\r\nEcuador 1\r\nGuatemala 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds\r\nmajority, Mexico was elected a member of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council for a three-year\r\nterm beginning on 1 January 2000.\r\nThe President: The following 18 States have been\r\nelected to the Economic and Social Council: Angola,\r\nAustria, Bahrain, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Costa\r\nRica, Croatia, Cuba, Fiji, France, Germany, Greece,\r\nJapan, Mexico, Portugal, the Sudan and Suriname.

In paragraph 9 of that\r\nreport, the Committee recommends to the Assembly the\r\nadoption of draft resolution A/C.5/54/L.8 as orally\r\namended, which was adopted by the Committee without\r\na vote.\r\nRegarding agenda item 119 entitled “Programme\r\nbudget for the biennium 1998-1999”, particularly as\r\nconcerns the question of the Development Account, the\r\nreport of the Committee is contained in document\r\nA/54/508.

May I remind members that under\r\nparagraph 7 of decision 34/401 the Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered\r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a\r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote\r\nonly once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary\r\nmeeting unless that delegation\u0027s vote in plenary\r\nmeeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I also remind delegations that, also in\r\naccordance with decision 34/401, explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\nare going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner\r\nas was done in the Fifth Committee, unless notified\r\notherwise.\r\nAgenda item 117\r\nFinancial reports and audited financial statements,\r\nand reports of the Board of Auditors\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/54/506)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on a draft resolution recommended by the Fifth\r\nCommittee in paragraph 6 of its report.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to\r\ndo likewise?\r\nThe resolution was adopted [resolution 54/13].\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this stage\r\nof our consideration of agenda item 117.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 October 1999\r\nAgenda item 118\r\nReview of the efficiency of the administrative and\r\nfinancial functioning of the United Nations\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/54/511)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on the draft resolution recommended by the Fifth\r\nCommittee in paragraph 9 of its report.\r\nThe draft resolution entitled “Procurement reform”\r\nwas adopted by the Committee without a vote. May I take\r\nit that the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 54/14).\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this stage of\r\nour consideration of agenda item 118.\r\nAgenda item 119\r\nProgramme budget for the biennium 1998-1999\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/54/508)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on the draft resolution recommended by the Fifth\r\nCommittee in paragraph 12 of its report.\r\nThe draft resolution entitled “Development Account”\r\nwas adopted by the Committee without a vote. May I take\r\nit that the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 54/15).\r\nThe President: I now call on those representatives\r\nwho wish to speak in explanation of vote after the vote.\r\nMr. Barnnell (Guyana): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China in explanation of\r\nvote on agenda item 119, entitled “Programme budget for\r\nthe biennium 1998-1999”.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China welcomes the conclusion\r\nof the deliberations on the issue of modalities and\r\nsustainability of the Development Account.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China welcomes the conclusion\r\nof negotiations on the issue after difficult and lengthy\r\ndeliberations on the matter. In this process, the Group\r\ndemonstrated a spirit of cooperation and understanding in\r\nseeking consensus on this matter and looks forward to the\r\ncontinuation of this spirit in further negotiations in the\r\nFifth Committee.\r\nThe Group\u0027s understanding of paragraph 2 of the\r\nresolution is that the cumulative savings achieved as a\r\nresult of efficiency measures will be transferred to the\r\nDevelopment Account section in the budget, with prior\r\napproval of the General Assembly, and will form the\r\nmaintenance base of the budget section relating to the\r\nDevelopment Account for subsequent bienniums.\r\nThe Group would once again like to reaffirm its\r\nposition that the operation of the Development Account\r\nshould be in accordance with the relevant regulations and\r\nrules of the Organization, since it is part of the regular\r\nbudget. Further, it must neither be a budget- nor a staff-\r\nreduction exercise.\r\nWe would also like to stress that the correlation\r\nbeing sought between the Development Account and\r\nefficiency measures is not appropriate. Improved\r\nefficiency and effectiveness are essential to strengthen the\r\nOrganization\u0027s capacity to fulfil its role and must not be\r\ntrivialized. The Group is of the view that arbitrary\r\nproposals for savings during the formulation and\r\nimplementation phases of the budget should be avoided,\r\nsince they can have an adverse impact on programme\r\ndelivery. Therefore, we would like to reaffirm that the\r\nexercise of improving efficiency in the Organization must\r\nensure the full implementation of all mandated\r\nprogrammes and activities.\r\nFinally, we would like to request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit proposals for the use of the funds\r\nduring this session, as recommended by the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination. The projects approved\r\nshould be fully implemented in accordance with the\r\nFinancial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations\r\nand the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme\r\nPlanning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the\r\nMonitoring of Implementation and the Methods of\r\nEvaluation.\r\nMr. Sareva (Finland): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries associated with the European Union\r\n— Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,\r\nLatvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and\r\nSlovenia — and the associated countries Cyprus and\r\nMalta, as well as the European Free Trade Association\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 October 1999\r\n(EFTA) country member of the European Economic Area\r\n(EEA) Norway align themselves with this statement.\r\nI would first like to thank the representative of\r\nUganda, Mr. Nester Odaga-Jalomayo, for his outstanding\r\nwork as coordinator for this draft resolution. Our deep\r\nappreciation also goes to his predecessor, Mr. Humayun\r\nKabir of Bangladesh.\r\nThe European Union is pleased that we have adopted\r\nby consensus the draft resolution in document A/54/508,\r\ndealing with the modalities for operating the Development\r\nAccount. The preservation of consensus in the Fifth\r\nCommittee on budgetary matters is of great importance to\r\nthe European Union. It works to the advantage of all\r\nMember States and serves the common good of the United\r\nNations. It means an approach of win-win and not zero-\r\nsum.\r\nThe European Union has from the outset supported the\r\nconcept of the Development Account, as launched by the\r\nSecretary-General as part of his Track II reform package.\r\nWe have also consistently supported the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nproposals on the modalities and sustainability of the\r\nAccount. The resolution adequately reflects these proposals.\r\nThe Account is of a multi-year character, which provides\r\nfor increased flexibility in the use of funds. It does not\r\namount to a budget- or staff-reduction exercise. It excludes\r\nan ex ante approval of the efficiency measures.\r\nThe adoption of this resolution will now enable the\r\nSecretary-General to come up with detailed proposals for\r\nthe projects to be funded from the Account during the next\r\nbiennium. We look forward to the submission of these\r\nproposals and expect that they will have succinct objectives,\r\nmeasurable outcomes and clear performance indicators and\r\nthat they will complement existing programmes.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nCuba.\r\nMs. Buergo Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): As\r\nit has indicated on numerous occasions, my delegation fully\r\nsupports the establishment of the Development Account.\r\nWe are therefore very pleased that this afternoon the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been able to adopt a definitive\r\ndecision on the modalities of the functioning of the\r\nAccount.\r\nWe fully associates ourselves with the statement made\r\nby the representative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China, in which he expressed the positions held by\r\nmy delegation.\r\nHowever, we would like to reiterate in particular our\r\ndelegation\u0027s understanding that all savings accumulated as\r\na result of any efficiency measures shall be transferred to\r\nthe appropriate Development Account section with the\r\nprior approval of the General Assembly, and that those\r\nsavings shall form the maintenance base for that section\r\nin future proposed programme budgets.\r\nWe also consider that the resources allocated to this\r\nsection should not be utilized to fund activities that are\r\nnormally funded through extrabudgetary sources. We\r\nawait with interest the proposals to be made soon by the\r\nSecretary-General regarding the future use of already\r\nexisting funds for this section.\r\nFinally, allow us to reaffirm that the implementation\r\nof the Development Account should not lead to any\r\noverall reduction in the budget of the Organization.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nexplanation of vote.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 119.\r\nAgenda item 123\r\nJoint Inspection Unit\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/54/507)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on the draft resolution recommended by\r\nthe Fifth Committee in paragraph 6 of its report.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote.

It is\r\ncritically important that the United Nations, in keeping with\r\nits central characteristic of being representative of all\r\nMember States, is enabled to effectively conduct its\r\nactivities at the field level.\r\nIt is our view that the success or failure of the Mission\r\nwill very much depend on the staff of the Mission itself,\r\nand they will represent the Organization itself. Obviously,\r\nif the staff of the Mission conduct their mandated activities\r\nin a neutral and impartial manner, this would be a key\r\nelement in maintaining the character of the Organization.\r\nThis is even more urgent since most of the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in the region are in the conflict area.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to stress that in order for\r\nthe Mission to be successful, it is important that it be well\r\nprepared and well organized, both at Headquarters and in\r\nthe field.\r\nAs host country for the United Nations Mission in\r\nEast Timor, we are fully committed to the success of the\r\nMission and have not failed to show our cooperation in\r\nthis regard. Thus my delegation welcomes the assurances\r\nof the Secretariat that the host country\u0027s contribution in\r\nproviding the necessary facilities and premises to the\r\nMission, thereby enabling it to avail itself of significant\r\nsavings, will be reflected in the next performance report.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to end by\r\nexpressing our sincere appreciation to Mr. Ahmed\r\nDarwish of Egypt, in his capacity as coordinator, for his\r\nremarkable efforts in forging a consensus resolution on\r\nthis issue.\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this stage\r\nof our consideration of agenda item 169.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.15 p.m.\r\n9\r\n"
