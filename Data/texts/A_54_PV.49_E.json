(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Hosseinian\r\n(Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nFloods in Viet Nam\r\nThe Acting President: May I, on behalf of all the\r\nmembers of the Assembly, extend our deepest sympathy to\r\nthe Government and the people of Viet Nam for the tragic\r\nloss of life and extensive material damage that have\r\nresulted from the recent floods.\r\nMay I also express the hope that the international\r\ncommunity will show its solidarity and respond promptly\r\nand generously to any request for help.\r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh (Viet Nam): On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Viet Nam, I wish to express our appreciation\r\nfor your words of sympathy, Sir. The damage caused by the\r\nflood in central provinces of Viet Nam is very serious and\r\nextensive. According to initial reports, human losses\r\nnumbered over 600 lives. More than 600,000 houses have\r\nbeen flooded and damaged and about 42,000 hectares of\r\nrice paddies and other crops flooded and destroyed.\r\nHundreds of ships have been sunk and destroyed. The total\r\neconomic loss is estimated at about 718 billion Vietnamese\r\ndong, equivalent to over $51 million.\r\nThe Government of Viet Nam has taken all the\r\nnecessary measures to overcome the consequences of the\r\ndisaster. In this connection, we welcome any international\r\nassistance to help alleviate the suffering of the people in\r\nthe affected areas and restore their lives to normalcy.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs\r\nand other appointments\r\n(h) Appointment of members of the Joint Inspection\r\nUnit\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/54/108)\r\nThe Acting President: As indicated in document\r\nA/54/108, the General Assembly is required, during the\r\nfifty-fourth session, to appoint four members to fill the\r\nvacancies on the Joint Inspection Unit that will arise from\r\nthe expiration of the terms of office on 31 December\r\n2000 of Mr. Andrzej Abraszewski (Poland), Mr. John Fox\r\n(United States of America), Mr. Wolfgang Münch\r\n(Germany) and Mr. Louis Dominique Ouedraogo\r\n(Burkina Faso).\r\nAs also indicated in document A/54/108, in\r\naccordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the statute of\r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit, the President of the General\r\nAssembly shall consult with Member States to draw up a\r\nlist of four countries that would be requested to propose\r\ncandidates for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 November 1999\r\nAfter holding the necessary consultations with the\r\nregional groups, I should like to communicate to the\r\nAssembly the following information received from the\r\nchairmen of regional groups. For one vacancy from the\r\nAfrican States, the group of African States has endorsed\r\nBurkina Faso. For one vacancy from the Eastern European\r\nStates, there are four candidates: Belarus, Croatia, Romania\r\nand The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. For two\r\nvacancies from the Western European and other States,\r\nthere are three candidates: Austria, Germany and the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nAs the group of African States has endorsed one\r\ncandidate for one vacancy — Burkina Faso — that country\r\nwill therefore be included in the list of countries to be\r\ndrawn up and the Government of Burkina Faso will be\r\nrequested to propose a candidate for appointment to the\r\nJoint Inspection Unit.\r\nSince, from among the Eastern European States, there\r\nare four candidates for one vacancy, and from among the\r\nWestern European and other States, there are three\r\ncandidates for two vacancies, in order to complete the\r\ndrawing up of the list I should like, in accordance with past\r\npractice, to consult with Member States through the\r\nprocedure of holding an advisory vote by secret ballot to\r\nselect one country from among the Eastern European States\r\nand two countries from among the Western European and\r\nother States. The three selected countries would each be\r\nrequested to propose a candidate for appointment to the\r\nJoint Inspection Unit.\r\nAlthough this advisory vote would not be an election,\r\nwe would follow the rules of procedure of the Assembly\r\ngoverning elections.\r\nIf there is no objection, may I take it that the General\r\nAssembly agrees to that procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with existing\r\npractice, the countries receiving the greatest number of\r\nvotes and not less than a majority of the votes of those\r\npresent and voting shall be included in the list of countries\r\nto be drawn up. The countries drawn up would be requested\r\nto propose candidates for appointment to the Joint\r\nInspection Unit.\r\nMay I also take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In the case of a tie vote for\r\na remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited\r\nto those candidates that have obtained an equal number of\r\nvotes.\r\nI take it that the Assembly also agrees to that\r\nprocedure.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I remind members that\r\nthe Assembly is not — I repeat, not — appointing\r\nmembers to the Joint Inspection Unit at this time. It is\r\nonly selecting three countries, each of which will be\r\nrequested to propose a candidate. Therefore, only the\r\nname of a country, and not the name of an individual,\r\nshould appear on the ballot paper. Let me repeat that only\r\nthe name of a country, and not the name of an individual,\r\nshould appear on the ballot paper.\r\nI should now like to repeat the names of the four\r\ncountries from among the Eastern European States that\r\nwish to propose a candidate: Belarus, Croatia, Romania\r\nand The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I\r\nshould further like to point out that, from the Eastern\r\nEuropean States, the Russian Federation already has a\r\nnational serving on the Joint Inspection Unit. The name\r\nof that State therefore should not appear on the ballot\r\npaper.\r\nI should next like to repeat the names of the three\r\ncountries from among the Western European and other\r\nStates that wish to propose a candidate: Austria, Germany\r\nand the United States of America. I should also like to\r\npoint out that, from the Western European and other\r\nStates, Italy already has a national serving on the Joint\r\nInspection Unit. The name of that State therefore should\r\nnot appear on the ballot paper.\r\nThe Assembly will now proceed to the selection of\r\none country from among the Eastern European States and\r\ntwo countries from among the Western European and\r\nother States, each of which will be requested to propose\r\ncandidates to fill the vacancies on the Joint Inspection\r\nUnit.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers\r\nmarked “A” and “B” will now be distributed. May I\r\nrequest representatives to write on the ballot paper\r\nmarked “A” for the Eastern European States the name of\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 November 1999\r\nthe one State for which they wish to vote, and on the ballot\r\npaper marked “B” for the Western European and other\r\nStates the names of the two States for which they wish to\r\nvote. Ballot papers marked “A” bearing the name of more\r\nthan one State and ballot papers marked “B” bearing the\r\nnames of more than two States will be declared invalid.\r\nThe name of a Member State on a ballot paper that does\r\nnot belong to the relevant region and the name of an\r\nindividual on a ballot paper shall not be counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Regmi (Nepal),\r\nMs. Mbega (the United Republic of Tanzania) and\r\nMr. Conteras (Venezuela) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 3.35 p.m. and resumed\r\nat 4.25 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 175\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 174\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 173\r\nRequired majority: 87\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nRomania 65\r\nBelarus 60\r\nThe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 28\r\nCroatia 20\r\nGroup B — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 175\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 175\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of members voting: 173\r\nRequired majority: 87\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nGermany 134\r\nAustria 103\r\nUnited States of America 101\r\nHaving obtained the required majority and having\r\nreceived the greatest number of votes, Germany and\r\nAustria will be included on the list of countries to be\r\ndrawn up.\r\nThe Acting President: Since there remains one\r\ncountry to be selected from among the Eastern European\r\nStates, we shall now proceed to the first restricted ballot.\r\nThis second round of balloting shall be restricted to the\r\ntwo States from among the Eastern European States that\r\nwere not selected but that obtained the greatest number of\r\nvotes in the previous ballot, namely Belarus and Romania.\r\nThis is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of\r\nprocedure of the General Assembly.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers\r\nmarked “A” will now be distributed. May I request\r\nrepresentatives to write on the ballot paper marked “A”,\r\nfor the Eastern European States, the name of the one\r\nState for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers marked\r\n“A” bearing the names of more than one State will be\r\ndeclared invalid. Ballot papers bearing the name of a\r\nState that does not belong to the Eastern European region\r\nor bearing the name of an individual will not be counted\r\nat all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Regmi\r\n(Nepal), Ms. Mbega (United Republic of Tanzania)\r\nand Mr. Contreras (Venezuela) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 4.35 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 4.55 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 175\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 174\r\nAbstentions: 4\r\nNumber of members voting: 170\r\nRequired majority: 86\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nRomania 93\r\nBelarus 77\r\nHaving obtained the required majority, Romania will\r\nbe included on the list of countries to be drawn up.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 8 November 1999\r\nThe Acting President: I thank members for their\r\nadvice and assistance, and I thank the tellers for their\r\nassistance.\r\nIn accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the\r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, Austria, Burkina Faso,\r\nGermany and Romania will be requested to submit the\r\nnames of the candidates and their curricula vitae\r\nhighlighting their relevant qualifications for the tasks ahead.\r\nAfter holding the appropriate consultations described\r\nin article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute of the Joint\r\nInspection Unit, including consultations with the President\r\nof the Economic and Social Council and with the\r\nSecretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of the\r\nAdministrative Committee on Coordination, the President\r\nof the General Assembly will propose a list of\r\nqualified — I repeat, qualified — candidates to the\r\nAssembly for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 17.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5 p.m.\r\n4\r\n"
