(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 125 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/54/333/Add.2)\r\nThe President: In a letter contained in document\r\nA/54/333/Add.2, the Secretary-General informs me that,\r\nsince the issuance of his communications contained in\r\ndocument A/54/333 and addendum 1, Sierra Leone has\r\nmade the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the\r\namount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 10\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/54/1)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly, in accordance\r\nwith the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting on 17\r\nSeptember 1999, will now take up agenda item 10, entitled\r\n“Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization”, to hear a presentation by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of his annual report.\r\nI give the floor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: I am deeply honoured to\r\naddress this last session of the General Assembly of the\r\ntwentieth century and to present my annual report on the\r\nwork of the Organization. The text of the report is before\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nOn this occasion, I should like to address the\r\nprospects for human security and intervention in the next\r\ncentury. In the light of the dramatic events of the past\r\nyear, I trust that the Assembly will understand this\r\ndecision.\r\nAs Secretary-General, I have made it my highest\r\nduty to restore the United Nations to its rightful role in\r\nthe pursuit of peace and security, and to bring it closer to\r\nthe peoples it serves. As we stand at the brink of a new\r\ncentury, this mission continues. But it continues in a\r\nworld transformed by geopolitical, economic,\r\ntechnological and environmental changes whose lasting\r\nsignificance still eludes us. As we seek new ways to\r\ncombat the ancient enemies of war and poverty, we will\r\nsucceed only if we all adapt our Organization to a world\r\nwith new actors, new responsibilities and new possibilities\r\nfor peace and progress.\r\nThe sovereign state, in its most basic sense, is being\r\nredefined by the forces of globalization and international\r\ncooperation. The state is now widely understood to be the\r\nservant of its people, and not vice versa. At the same\r\ntime, individual sovereignty — and by this I mean the\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of each and\r\nevery individual, as enshrined in our Charter — has been\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nenhanced by a renewed consciousness of the right of every\r\nindividual to control his or her own destiny.\r\nThese parallel developments — remarkable and in\r\nmany ways welcome — do not lend themselves to easy\r\ninterpretations or simple conclusions. They do, however,\r\ndemand of us a willingness to think anew about how the\r\nUnited Nations responds to the political, human rights and\r\nhumanitarian crises affecting so much of the world; about\r\nthe means employed by the international community in\r\nsituations of need; and about our willingness to act in some\r\nareas of conflict while limiting ourselves to humanitarian\r\npalliatives in many other crises whose daily toll of death\r\nand suffering ought to shame us into action.\r\nOur reflections on these critical questions derive not\r\nonly from the events of the past year but from a variety of\r\nchallenges that confront us today, most urgently in East\r\nTimor. From Sierra Leone to the Sudan to Angola to the\r\nBalkans and to Cambodia, and then to Afghanistan, there\r\nare a great number of peoples who need more than just\r\nwords of sympathy from the international community. They\r\nneed a real and sustained commitment to help end their\r\ncycles of violence and launch them on a safe passage to\r\nprosperity.\r\nWhile the genocide in Rwanda will define for our\r\ngeneration the consequences of inaction in the face of mass\r\nmurder, the more recent conflict in Kosovo has prompted\r\nimportant questions about the consequences of action in the\r\nabsence of complete unity on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. It has cast in stark relief the dilemma of what\r\nhas been called “humanitarian intervention”: on one side,\r\nthe question of the legitimacy of an action taken by a\r\nregional organization without a United Nations mandate; on\r\nthe other, the universally recognized imperative of\r\neffectively halting gross and systematic violations of human\r\nrights with grave humanitarian consequences.\r\nThe inability of the international community in the\r\ncase of Kosovo to reconcile these two equally compelling\r\ninterests — universal legitimacy and effectiveness in\r\ndefence of human rights — can be viewed only as a\r\ntragedy. It has revealed the core challenge to the Security\r\nCouncil and to the United Nations as a whole in the next\r\ncentury: to forge unity behind the principle that massive\r\nand systematic violations of human rights — wherever they\r\nmay take place — should not be allowed to stand.\r\nThe Kosovo conflict and its outcome have prompted\r\na wide debate of profound importance to the resolution of\r\nconflicts, from the Balkans to Central Africa to East Asia.\r\nAnd to each side in this critical debate, difficult questions\r\ncan be posed.\r\nTo those for whom the greatest threat to the future\r\nof international order is the use of force in the absence of\r\na Security Council mandate, one might ask, not in the\r\ncontext of Kosovo but in the context of Rwanda, if, in\r\nthose dark days and hours leading up to the genocide, a\r\ncoalition of States had been prepared to act in defence of\r\nthe Tutsi population, but did not receive prompt Council\r\nauthorization, should such a coalition have stood aside\r\nand allowed the horror to unfold?\r\nTo those for whom the Kosovo action heralded a\r\nnew era when States and groups of States can take\r\nmilitary action outside the established mechanisms for\r\nenforcing international law, one might ask: is there not a\r\ndanger of such interventions undermining the imperfect,\r\nyet resilient, security system created after the Second\r\nWorld War, and of setting dangerous precedents for\r\nfuture interventions without a clear criterion to decide\r\nwho might invoke these precedents and in what\r\ncircumstances?\r\nIn response to this turbulent era of crises and\r\ninterventions, there are those who have suggested that the\r\nCharter itself — with its roots in the aftermath of global\r\ninter-State war — is ill-suited to guide us in a world of\r\nethnic wars and intra-State violence. I believe they are\r\nwrong.\r\nThe Charter is a living document whose high\r\nprinciples still define the aspirations of peoples\r\neverywhere for lives of peace, dignity and development.\r\nNothing in the Charter precludes a recognition that there\r\nare rights beyond borders. Indeed, its very letter and spirit\r\nare the affirmation of those fundamental human rights. In\r\nshort, it is not the deficiencies of the Charter which have\r\nbrought us to this juncture, but our difficulties in applying\r\nits principles to a new era — an era when strictly\r\ntraditional notions of sovereignty can no longer do justice\r\nto the aspirations of peoples everywhere to attain their\r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nThe sovereign States that drafted the Charter over a\r\nhalf century ago were dedicated to peace, but experienced\r\nin war. They knew the terror of conflict, but knew equally\r\nthat there are times when the use of force may be\r\nlegitimate in pursuit of peace. That is why the Charter’s\r\nown words declare that “armed force shall not be used,\r\nsave in the common interest”. But what is the common\r\ninterest? Who shall define it? Who will defend it —\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nunder whose authority and with what means of\r\nintervention? These are the monumental questions facing us\r\nas we enter the new century. While I will not propose\r\nspecific answers or criteria, I shall identify four aspects of\r\nintervention which I believe hold important lessons for\r\nresolving future conflicts.\r\nFirst, it is important to define intervention as broadly\r\nas possible, to include actions along a wide continuum from\r\nthe most pacific to the most coercive. A tragic irony of\r\nmany of the crises that continue to go unnoticed and\r\nunchallenged today is that they could be dealt with by far\r\nless perilous acts of intervention than the one we witnessed\r\nrecently in Yugoslavia. Yet the commitment of the\r\ninternational community to peacekeeping, to humanitarian\r\nassistance and to rehabilitation and reconstruction varies\r\ngreatly from region to region and crisis to crisis.\r\nIf the new commitment to intervention in the face of\r\nextreme suffering is to retain the support of the world’s\r\npeoples, it must be, and must be seen to be, fairly and\r\nconsistently applied, irrespective of region or nation.\r\nHumanity, after all, is indivisible. It is also necessary to\r\nrecognize that any armed intervention is itself a result of\r\nthe failure of prevention. As we consider the future of\r\nintervention, we must redouble our efforts to enhance our\r\npreventive capabilities, including early warning, preventive\r\ndiplomacy, preventive deployment and preventive\r\ndisarmament.\r\nA recent powerful tool of deterrence has been the\r\nactions of the Tribunals for Rwanda and for the former\r\nYugoslavia. In their battle against impunity lies a key to\r\ndeterring crimes against humanity. With these concerns in\r\nmind, I have dedicated the introductory essay of my annual\r\nreport to exploring ways of moving from a culture of\r\nreaction to a culture of prevention. Even the costliest policy\r\nof prevention is far cheaper, in lives and in resources, than\r\nthe least expensive of armed force.\r\nSecondly, it is clear that sovereignty alone is not the\r\nonly obstacle to effective action in human rights or\r\nhumanitarian crises. No less significant are the ways in\r\nwhich the States Members of the United Nations define\r\ntheir national interest in any given crisis. Of course, the\r\ntraditional pursuit of national interest is a permanent feature\r\nof international relations and of the life and work of the\r\nSecurity Council. But I believe that as the world has\r\nchanged in profound ways since the end of the cold war,\r\nour conceptions of national interest have failed to follow\r\nsuit.\r\nA new, more broadly defined, more widely\r\nconceived definition of national interest in the new\r\ncentury would, I am convinced, induce States to find far\r\ngreater unity in the pursuit of such basic Charter values\r\nas democracy, pluralism, human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw. A global era requires global engagement. Indeed, in\r\na growing number of challenges facing humanity, the\r\ncollective interest is the national interest.\r\nThirdly, in the event that forceful intervention\r\nbecomes necessary, we must ensure that the Security\r\nCouncil, the body charged with authorizing force under\r\ninternational law, is able to rise to the challenge. As I\r\nsaid during the Kosovo conflict, the choice must not be\r\nbetween, on the one hand, Council unity and inaction in\r\nthe face of genocide, as in the case of Rwanda and, on\r\nthe other, Council division and regional action, as in the\r\ncase of Kosovo. In both cases, the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations should have been able to find common\r\nground in upholding the principles of the Charter and in\r\nacting in defence of our common humanity.\r\nAs important as the Council’s enforcement power is\r\nits deterrent power. Unless it is able to assert itself\r\ncollectively when the cause is just and when the means\r\nare available, its credibility in the eyes of the world may\r\nwell suffer. If States bent on criminal behaviour know\r\nthat frontiers are not the absolute defence and if they\r\nknow that the Security Council will take action to halt\r\ncrimes against humanity, they will not embark on such a\r\ncourse of action in expectation of sovereign impunity.\r\nThe Charter requires the Council to be the defender\r\nof the common interest, and unless it is seen to be so in\r\nan era of human rights, interdependence and globalization,\r\nthere is a danger that others could seek to take its place.\r\nLet me say that the Council’s prompt and effective action\r\nin authorizing a multinational force for East Timor\r\nreflects precisely the unity of purpose that I have called\r\nfor today. Already, however, far too many lives have\r\nbeen lost and far too much destruction has taken place for\r\nus to rest on our laurels. The hard work of bringing peace\r\nand stability to East Timor still awaits us.\r\nFinally, after the conflict is over, in East Timor as\r\neverywhere, it is vitally important that the commitment to\r\npeace be as strong as the commitment to war. In this\r\nsituation, too, consistency is essential. Just as our\r\ncommitment to humanitarian action must be universal if\r\nit is to be legitimate, so our commitment to peace cannot\r\nend with the cessation of hostilities. The aftermath of war\r\nrequires no less skill, no less sacrifice and no fewer\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nresources in order to forge a lasting peace and avoid a\r\nreturn to violence. The Kosovo Mission and other United\r\nNations missions currently deployed or looming over the\r\nhorizon present us with just such a challenge.\r\nUnless the United Nations is given the means and the\r\nsupport to succeed, not only the peace, but the war, too,\r\nwill have been lost. From civil administration and policing\r\nto the creation of a civil society capable of sustaining a\r\ntolerant, pluralist, prosperous society, the challenges facing\r\nour peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-building\r\nmissions are immense. But if we are given the means — in\r\nKosovo, in Sierra Leone and in East Timor — we have a\r\nreal opportunity to break the cycles of violence, once and\r\nfor all.\r\nWe leave a century of unparalleled suffering and\r\nviolence. Our greatest, most enduring test remains our\r\nability to gain the respect and support of the world’s\r\npeoples. If the collective conscience of humanity — a\r\nconscience which abhors cruelty, renounces injustice and\r\nseeks peace for all peoples — cannot find in the United\r\nNations its greatest tribune, there is a grave danger that it\r\nwill look elsewhere for peace and for justice. If it does not\r\nhear in our voices, and see in our actions, reflections of its\r\nown aspirations, its needs and its fears, it may soon lose\r\nfaith in our ability to make a difference.\r\nJust as we have learned that the world cannot stand\r\naside when gross and systematic violations of human rights\r\nare taking place, so we have also learned that intervention\r\nmust be based on legitimate and universal principles if it is\r\nto enjoy the sustained support of the world’s peoples.\r\nThis developing international norm in favour of\r\nintervention to protect civilians from wholesale slaughter\r\nwill no doubt continue to pose profound challenges to the\r\ninternational community. Any such evolution in our\r\nunderstanding of state sovereignty and individual\r\nsovereignty will, in some quarters, be met with distrust,\r\nscepticism and even hostility. But it is an evolution that we\r\nshould welcome.\r\nWhy? Because, despite its limitations and\r\nimperfections, it is testimony to a humanity that cares more,\r\nnot less, for the suffering in its midst; and a humanity that\r\nwill do more, and not less, to end it. It is a hopeful sign at\r\nthe end of the twentieth century.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for his\r\npresentation.\r\nWe have concluded this stage of our consideration\r\nof agenda item 10.\r\nAgenda item 9\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the first\r\nspeaker in the general debate, I should like to remind\r\nmembers of the decision taken by the General Assembly\r\nat its 3rd plenary meeting, on 17 September, that\r\ncongratulations should not be expressed inside the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall after a speech has been delivered.\r\nIn this connection, may I remind members of\r\nanother decision taken by the Assembly at the same\r\nmeeting: that speakers in the general debate, after\r\ndelivering their statements, would leave the Assembly\r\nHall through Room GA-200, located behind the podium,\r\nbefore returning to their seats.\r\nI should also like to remind representatives that in\r\naccordance with the decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at its 3rd plenary meeting, the list of speakers\r\nwill be closed on Wednesday, 22 September 1999, at\r\n6 p.m. May I request delegations to be good enough to\r\nprovide estimated speaking times that are as accurate as\r\npossible. This will facilitate the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI should now like to recall for the attention of\r\nMembers paragraph 21 of the annex to resolution 51/241,\r\nwhereby the General Assembly indicated a voluntary\r\nguideline of up to 20 minutes for each statement in the\r\ngeneral debate. Within this given time-frame, I should\r\nlike to appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a\r\nnormal speed so that the interpretation may be provided\r\nproperly.\r\nThe first speaker in the general debate is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil, His Excellency\r\nMr. Luiz Felipe Lampreia. I give him the floor.\r\nMr. Lampreia (Brazil) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Brazil\r\ncongratulates you, Sir, on your election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Your\r\npersonal record in defence of democracy and human\r\nrights, which was forged in the struggle of the people of\r\nNamibia for liberty and self-determination, offers an\r\ninspiring example for our work.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nAs a sister nation of Uruguay, we take pride in the\r\nwork done by your predecessor, my friend, Minister Didier\r\nOpertti. I would like to express the appreciation and\r\ngratitude of the Brazilian Government for his decisive role\r\nin presiding over the fifty-third session.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan is equally deserving of\r\nspecial recognition. In these times of far-reaching and\r\nuncharted challenges before the international community,\r\nhis sense of proportion and the strength of his serene\r\nleadership have been valuable aids in the search for realistic\r\nand innovative solutions. We appreciate and support his\r\nendeavours in the cause of peace, development and justice.\r\nThe Brazilian Government warmly greets the\r\nadmission of Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga, which have just\r\njoined the United Nations family.\r\nYear after year, for over half a century, we have\r\ngathered here to discuss and debate the issues of our time.\r\nYear after year, the representatives of the Member countries\r\nof the United Nations have come to this rostrum to set forth\r\ntheir vision of global affairs and to provide analysis and to\r\npropose solutions.\r\nAs the requirements of our societies become ever\r\ngreater over time, there grows a sense of an ever-widening\r\ngulf between our words and our deeds, a distance that\r\nserves only to feed the scepticism of some and the\r\npessimism of others.\r\nWhenever an unfolding crisis and its human tragedy\r\nbreak through international indifference and become\r\nnewsworthy, it is to the United Nations that the public\r\nopinion of our countries looks for meaningful answers.\r\nUnfortunately, however, the international community\r\nfeels compelled to act in a coordinated fashion, mobilizing\r\nthe necessary resources and political will, only when long-\r\nfestering problems threaten to get out of hand, making a\r\nsatisfactory solution all the more difficult.\r\nThe upshot is a sense of frustration and impatience\r\ntowards the United Nations. This may be because the\r\nnecessary initiatives are in the end adopted outside the\r\nUnited Nations framework, as was the case in Kosovo. Or\r\nit may be because the measures agreed are not up to the\r\nconcrete needs, as we have seen in East Timor. Or it may\r\neven be because the United Nations finds itself once again\r\nconfronted, as in Angola, with well-known conflicts of\r\ncatastrophic proportions that the international community\r\nhas failed to address in a timely manner.\r\nWhy is it that certain predicaments generate intense\r\nmobilization of ways and means, but not others? Why\r\ndoes human suffering in some parts of the globe fuel\r\ngreater indignation than when it takes place elsewhere?\r\nThe plight of Angola and that of East Timor offer two\r\nglaring examples of what amounts to a clear pattern of\r\none-sided and unequal attention.\r\nIn Angola, UNITA’s refusal to abide by the Lusaka\r\nProtocol and hardened positions threaten to rekindle in all\r\nits intensity the same civil war that over a quarter of a\r\ncentury has caused incalculable suffering to millions in\r\nthat country, particularly the defenceless and the deprived.\r\nIn Angola, which has special bonds with Brazil, the\r\ninternational community is squarely faced — despite the\r\nlimited international press coverage — with an immense\r\npolitical challenge and a humanitarian disaster of\r\nshocking proportions. Urgent and priority action is called\r\nfor. The Security Council can no longer allow its\r\nresolutions to be blatantly ignored, as has been the case.\r\nNo less urgent — and in this case the United\r\nNations is now actively engaged — is the task of helping\r\nguarantee the right of the East Timorese people to decide\r\ntheir own future as an independent nation, a decision\r\nunmistakably voiced in a free ballot. Brazilian society,\r\nwhich shares linguistic, cultural and historic ties with the\r\nTimorese, joined in their rejoicing when the vote returned\r\na resounding verdict for independence. There was\r\nconsternation in Brazil at the violence against our brothers\r\nin East Timor and at the loss of innocent lives that\r\nfollowed.\r\nBrazil cannot accept, nor can Brazilian citizens\r\nunderstand, that the self-determination of the Timorese\r\npeople is not fully assured. We therefore believe that the\r\nmultinational force authorized by the Security Council —\r\na force in which Brazil was determined to participate\r\nfrom the very outset — will put a stop to the atrocities\r\ncommitted since the popular ballot and will be able to\r\nre-establish the necessary conditions for a peaceful\r\ntransition to independence.\r\nOver the past decade, Latin America, long viewed as\r\na land of backwardness and dictatorships, has fashioned\r\na new international image for itself through the\r\ntransformations it has undergone. The return to\r\ndemocracy in our countries has had a decisive role in this,\r\nas did our important achievements in fostering respect for\r\nhuman rights — although much remains to be done. The\r\nadoption of consistent economic policies, in turn, has\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nmade it possible to overcome the endless dilemmas that had\r\nensnared us, and to put an end to the inflationary spiral that\r\nhad brought so much uncertainty and injustice to our\r\ncitizens.\r\nLet there be no doubt that the difficulties that we\r\nexperienced, on and off, throughout 1999 will not cause us\r\nto lose faith and relinquish our achievements. For a few\r\ndays, or maybe weeks, at the beginning of the year, Brazil\r\nwas dubbed by some “the sick man of Latin America”. It\r\nwas thought that we might slip back into the trap of high\r\ninflation, that we would experience deep recession, that we\r\nwould once again resort to the panacea of stoking short-\r\nterm growth and return to the old boom-and-bust cycles of\r\nthe past.\r\nYet we have arrived at the end of the century with an\r\ninflation rate under 8 per cent. We fully expect to embark\r\non a course of sustained annual growth of more than 4 per\r\ncent and are set to bring to completion a large-scale\r\nmodernization programme by means of important reforms\r\nin tax, fiscal and social security matters. President Fernando\r\nHenrique Cardoso will not flinch in his determination to lay\r\nthe groundwork for our country to become modern,\r\neconomically fit and dynamic, as well as socially more just\r\nand politically mature.\r\nWith the advent of democracy, Brazil and Argentina\r\nhave developed the solid friendship that binds our peoples,\r\nand have over a short space of time built a lasting\r\nmonument to integration. Our bilateral agreements in the\r\nfield of nuclear cooperation are exemplary and a stabilizing\r\nforce in the region and worldwide. The Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) — which our two\r\ncountries joined Paraguay and Uruguay in establishing and\r\nwith which the democracies of Bolivia and Chile have\r\nassociated themselves — has fundamentally altered the\r\neconomic face of the hemisphere and indeed of the world.\r\nOur integration process is not directed against anyone, but,\r\non the contrary, seeks to strengthen our historical ties both\r\nwithin and beyond the Americas. Both individually and\r\nwithin the framework of MERCOSUR our countries have\r\nbecome a powerful force in the drive to set the international\r\ntrade system on a more open, balanced course, one that no\r\nlonger aids and abets protectionist privileges at the expense,\r\nmore often than not, of developing countries.\r\nDemocracy has made it possible for the countries of\r\nLatin America to provide mutual assistance — without\r\nundue and unsolicited foreign interference and in a spirit of\r\ncollaboration — whenever there is a jointly perceived threat\r\nto the institutional stability of one of them. Thanks to\r\ndemocracy, the countries of our region have successfully\r\nsolved disputes that for long disturbed the harmony of the\r\nmore peaceful and stable of continents. At the end of last\r\nyear, Ecuador and Peru, with the diplomatic support of\r\nBrazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States, signed in\r\nBrasilia the agreements that put an end to their long-\r\nrunning boundary dispute. Thus, despite all manner of\r\ndifficulties, Latin America is transforming itself into a\r\ntightly knit entity that is politically, economically and\r\nsocially integrated.\r\nIt is in this spirit of integration, and in the abiding\r\nawareness that we belong to one family, that Brazil feels\r\nclosely attuned to the various efforts at renewal under\r\nway in the region. The elections scheduled for next\r\nOctober in Argentina will no doubt confirm the political\r\nvitality of this great neighbour of ours and guarantee the\r\nnecessary economic conditions for stability and\r\nreinvigorated growth. These same favourable expectations,\r\nwe are sure, will be fulfilled at the elections to be held in\r\nChile and in Uruguay this year, and in Mexico next year.\r\nTheir outcome will most certainly underline the\r\ndemocratic character of Latin America.\r\nThe political and economic achievements of Bolivia\r\nsince the 1980s in overcoming obstacles that 20 years ago\r\nseemed insurmountable are a further indication of how\r\nmuch our region has changed for the better. Peru as well\r\nhas gained international recognition through its\r\nresounding successes in reversing the adverse economic\r\ntrends of past decades and in the war against terrorism\r\nand drug trafficking. This capacity to overcome obstacles\r\nis equally noticeable in Ecuador, where, with the support\r\nof international financial institutions, political forces\r\nwill — through democratic and constitutional channels —\r\nundertake the needed reforms to overcome the present\r\ncrisis. Paraguay, in turn, successfully dealt with a delicate\r\npolitical crisis at the beginning of this year and is moving\r\nsteadily along the road of democratic institution-building\r\nand economic development. Brazil, as always, will\r\ncontinue to decisively support Paraguay in that endeavour.\r\nGuyana provides a further demonstration, not only\r\nof our commitment to upholding and fostering democratic\r\nvalues, but equally of the integrationist spirit that inspires\r\nus. It is our hope that Suriname will join in the efforts\r\nand achievements of the region in bringing about these\r\npositive changes. The transformations that Venezuela is\r\nundergoing have drawn great international attention. This\r\nprocess of change must be respected, for it clearly and\r\nlegitimately reflects the Venezuelan people’s desire for\r\nrenewal. The expression of this aspiration through\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\ninstitutional channels is the best guarantee that the changes\r\nunder way will stay on the track of respect for the norms,\r\nrights and duties that define democracy.\r\nBrazil is also confident that the Government of\r\nPresident Andrés Pastrana, in Colombia, will persevere in\r\nits endeavours to bring peace to this kindred nation. Undue\r\nforeign interference would only aggravate an already\r\ncomplex situation, which it is up to the Colombians\r\nthemselves to overcome.\r\nIt is on the success of our neighbours, in which we\r\ntrust, that hinges the success of the Brazilian people and its\r\nGovernment in solving their own problems and in\r\novercoming their own challenges, which are neither few nor\r\nsmall.\r\nOrganized crime and drug trafficking today pose a\r\nmajor challenge to democratic societies. They clearly\r\nrepresent a serious threat to the security of national\r\ninstitutions and to citizens directly, who pay with their own\r\nlives the intolerable price for this scourge of our times. The\r\nspiralling stockpile of and trade in small arms is closely\r\nlinked to organized crime and drug trafficking. As its\r\ncitizens find their lives daily at risk because of contraband\r\nfirearms, Brazil gives the utmost priority to tackling this\r\nquestion. At the regional level we approved the important\r\nInter-American Convention on Transparency in\r\nConventional Weapons Acquisitions. We would like this\r\nAssembly to endorse the proposal to hold an international\r\nconference on illicit arms trafficking in all its aspects.\r\nSimilarly, Brazil attaches considerable importance to the\r\nwork being done on a draft convention against transnational\r\norganized crime.\r\nIn turn, the continued existence of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction remains a threat to the security and even the\r\nsurvival of humankind.\r\nAll actions contrary to the aims of the\r\nnon-proliferation regime should be firmly condemned by\r\nthe international community. At the same time, it behooves\r\nthe nuclear-armed States, as well as the threshold States, to\r\nmove towards the complete and irreversible elimination of\r\nnuclear armaments. For this reason, Brazil, Egypt, Ireland,\r\nMexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden will once\r\nagain submit, at this session, a draft resolution on a new\r\nagenda for nuclear disarmament. The draft resolution,\r\nwhich seeks to pave the way for a constructive dialogue on\r\nthis issue, is grounded on a realistic and balanced appraisal\r\nof the nature of the nuclear disarmament process.\r\nOur countries’ democratic institutions and the\r\ninternational organizations, particularly the United\r\nNations, face fundamental challenges today. Our countries\r\nare confronted daily with economic difficulties and acute\r\nsocial grievances, such as poverty and extremes of\r\ninequality, which heighten impatience: impatience with\r\neconomies unable to grow at a rate compatible with faster\r\nimprovement of the well-being of societies; impatience in\r\nthe face of vulnerability to crises and to turbulence in\r\ninternational markets; and impatience with political\r\nprocesses that sometimes appear slow to respond to the\r\nlegitimate and pressing demands of citizens. It is vital,\r\nhowever, that this collective impatience be voiced and\r\nguided through democratic channels.\r\nBrazil’s commitment to democratic institutions and\r\nto the primacy of law also applies to international\r\nrelations. At the outset of his second term of office, to\r\nwhich he was elected last October by an absolute majority\r\nof Brazilian voters, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso\r\nmade it clear that:\r\n“The rule of law is the only admissible\r\nfoundation for the international order. Should\r\nunilateralism and the use of force come to be\r\naccepted as organizing principles of international\r\nrelations, in the long term it will be more rational to\r\nside with the instruments of power politics rather\r\nthan to strive for order and to abide by law. If we\r\nare to see a truly new world order emerge, one of its\r\ncornerstones must be the acceptance that multilateral\r\ninstitutions — not least the Security Council — are\r\nthe source of legality and legitimacy for those\r\nactions that guarantee peace and the peaceful\r\nresolution of disputes”.\r\nOur societies await, again with increasing\r\nimpatience, seeing multilateral organizations, and in\r\nparticular the United Nations, show themselves to be up\r\nto the challenge of playing a meaningful — in fact,\r\ncrucial — role in establishing an international order\r\nattuned to the shared aspirations and values of humankind\r\nas a whole.\r\nThe road ahead calls for renewal and change. If the\r\nGovernments of the world desire a strong and effective\r\nUnited Nations, they must not only change how they\r\nthink and act with respect to this Organization, but they\r\nmust also think and act to bring about change in the\r\nOrganization. This is what is at stake. This is the\r\nchallenge before us.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nAddress by Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic\r\nof South Africa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of South Africa.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa, His Excellency\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Mbeki: On behalf of our Government and\r\nin my capacity as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, I\r\nwish to extend our sincere congratulations to you,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I would also like to thank you for the\r\nkind remarks you made about my country as you assumed\r\nyour high position.\r\nWe have worked together for many decades. Thanks\r\nin good measure to your statespersonship, as neighbours we\r\nlive together in peace and have joined hands as equals to\r\nensure the all-round fulfilment of both our peoples. These\r\nexperiences convince us that you will discharge your\r\nresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly in a\r\nmanner that will help humanity make our common world a\r\nbetter place for all. We are pleased that you will be\r\nworking with the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who has\r\ndemonstrated unquestionable commitment to the realization\r\nof the attainment of the goals of the Organization.\r\nThe Charter of this Organization and the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights provide all of us with the\r\nvision towards which we should strive. At the time these\r\ndocuments were adopted, they reflected the international\r\ndetermination to ensure that the catastrophe occasioned by\r\nthe rise of fascism and Nazism should never recur. We\r\nrecall them today because we believe that the time has\r\ncome for determined measures to be taken to ensure that\r\nthey inform what happens in the common world we all\r\nshare. The central message they contain is expressed in the\r\nwords of the preamble to the Declaration:\r\n“the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter\r\nreaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in\r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person and in the\r\nequal rights of men and women and have determined\r\nto promote social progress and better standards of\r\nlife in larger freedom”.\r\nWe believe that the time has come for all of us to\r\nensure that we work together to reconstruct human society\r\nin a manner consistent with this perspective. We further\r\nbelieve that what we have said constitutes a particular and\r\nhistoric challenge to those who occupy positions of\r\npolitical leadership in the modern era, those who, like us,\r\nwill have the privilege of addressing this General\r\nAssembly. Only time will tell whether we have the moral\r\nand intellectual courage to rise to this challenge.\r\nBut this we feel we can say: that conditions exist in\r\nthe world today for us successfully to pursue the vision\r\ncontained in the United Nations documents to which I\r\nhave referred. What may be in short supply is the courage\r\nof the politicians, as opposed to an abundance of good-\r\nsounding rhetoric. What are these conditions of which we\r\nspeak? The cold war has come to an end. There is no\r\nsign anywhere of an ideology-driven contest among\r\nsuper-Powers which dictates that each should seek to\r\ndestroy the other in order to protect itself. It is true that\r\na number of countries still possess weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons, which constitute\r\na threat. The only logical way to address this is\r\nvigorously to sue for universal disarmament and the\r\ndestruction of such weapons.\r\nSecondly, I believe it would be correct to say that\r\nthe overwhelming majority of countries in the world have\r\nopted for democratic forms of government. Having\r\nlearned from their own experiences, the nations have\r\nturned their backs on dictatorship. Of course, we cannot\r\nsay that such dictatorships do not exist or that no attempt\r\nwill be made in the future to establish them. But we can\r\nmake bold to say that these exceptions prove the rule,\r\nrather than disprove the proposition we are trying to\r\nadvance.\r\nThe combination of these two factors should lead to\r\nthree conclusions, at least. The first is that there should be\r\nno need on the part of any country to seek to establish\r\nspheres of influence as a supposed necessary condition for\r\nthe advancement of its national interests.\r\nSecondly, the very sustenance of democracy across\r\nthe globe requires that in every democratic country the\r\nordinary people should feel that they actually do enjoy the\r\nright to determine their destiny. In other words, no\r\ncountry should be required to restrict its exercise of this\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nright simply because some other more powerful country\r\ndictates that this should be so.\r\nThirdly, these circumstances create the possibility for\r\na more democratic system of international governance, as\r\nwould be reflected by a correct restructuring of this very\r\nOrganization. In any case, the process of globalization\r\nnecessarily redefines the concept and the practice of\r\nnational sovereignty. The frontiers of that sovereignty are\r\nbeing pushed back, especially as regards the smaller\r\ncountries of the world, such as our own. As this happens,\r\ninevitably, so does it become necessary that a compensatory\r\nmovement take place towards the reinforcement of the\r\nimpact of these countries on the system of global\r\ngovernance through the democratization of the system of\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe developments we have spoken of also suggest that\r\nperhaps, and depending on what we all do, humanity has\r\nnever had as bright a prospect for durable world peace and\r\nsecurity as it does today. The mere spread of democracy\r\nthroughout the world speaks of a greater commitment\r\namong the nations to the resolution of national and\r\ninternational conflicts by peaceful means.\r\nI am certain that when President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,\r\nthe current Chairperson of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), addresses the Assembly, he will report on the\r\nimportant decision recently taken at the Algiers summit of\r\nthe OAU to exclude from its ranks, with effect from the\r\nnext summit, all military regimes that may still exist on the\r\nAfrican continent. A further decision was taken to assist\r\nsuch countries resolutely to move towards a democratic\r\nsystem of government.\r\nThe developments on which we have commented\r\nwould suggest that the Organization has a responsibility to\r\nfocus especially on the objective contained in Article I,\r\nparagraph 1, of its Charter, which says,\r\n“to take effective collective measures for the\r\nprevention and removal of threats to the peace ... and\r\nto bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity\r\nwith the principles of justice and international law,\r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\r\nsituations which might lead to a breach of the peace”.\r\nThis, we believe, imposes a solemn and supreme\r\nresponsibility on the United Nations to work for the\r\nprevention of conflicts and to endeavour to resolve them so\r\nthat a durable peace can be established. Sometimes, our\r\nresponse to conflicts has been to wait for them to develop\r\ninto violence, and even wars, and subsequently to\r\nintervene through costly peacekeeping operations. These,\r\nat times, serve to freeze those conflicts, perpetuate\r\npolarization and make their timely resolution more\r\ndifficult.\r\nMoreover, the requirement on the United Nations to\r\nmake such interventions to prevent the outbreak of\r\nhostilities imposes an obligation on the United Nations\r\nthat it should be seen by Governments and peoples as a\r\ntruly even-handed interlocutor and peacemaker. It can\r\nattain this only if it works genuinely to\r\n“develop friendly relations among nations based on\r\nrespect for the principle of equal rights and self-\r\ndetermination of peoples”,\r\nas stated in Article I, paragraph 2, of its Charter.\r\nIf indeed we are seriously committed to these critical\r\nobjectives of peace and democracy in the world, then we\r\nhave no excuse to permit the further postponement of the\r\nmeaningful restructuring of the United Nations. If we\r\nwere honest with ourselves, we would admit that what is\r\nblocking progress is the desire to accommodate what are\r\nperceived as new power relations, to reinstitutionalize\r\nrelations of inequality within the United Nations in an\r\namended form. This is based on the thesis that the\r\ninstitutionalization of such relations has precedence over\r\nthe Organization’s founding principle of respect for the\r\nprinciple of equal rights among the nations.\r\nIn the situation of the cold war and the prevalence\r\nof dictatorship in many countries, the politics of power\r\nmight have been seen as the only path to survival. The\r\nmanagement of the world today through the exercise of\r\nsuch power, however modified, will itself subvert the\r\nobjectives of democracy and peace, spawning pretenders\r\nto the throne at global, continental and regional levels.\r\nSimultaneously as the United Nations focuses on the\r\ncritical question of the prevention of conflict, so must it\r\nattend to such issues as the elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, the implementation of the ban on anti-\r\npersonnel mines, the removal of mines in those countries\r\nwhich face this problem and the control of the\r\nproliferation of small arms. Of course, none of these\r\nproposals gainsay the need for the United Nations to act\r\nwith all necessary vigour to help end all existing conflicts\r\nof which it is seized, including those in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Angola, Western Sahara, East\r\nTimor, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Kosovo and others.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nWe started off with a quotation from the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which speaks of affirming\r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, the promotion\r\nof social progress and securing a better life for all. We\r\nargued that conditions exist for movement towards the\r\nrealization of the objectives spelt out in the Declaration. It\r\nis a matter of common cause among all of us that the levels\r\nof poverty, ignorance and disease that continue to afflict\r\nbillions around the globe constitute a direct denial of the\r\ndignity and worth of the human person to which we have\r\ncommitted ourselves. I am certain that we would also agree\r\nthat the process of globalization has also been accompanied\r\nby growing inequality within and among countries. We\r\nhave also seen how movements of short-term capital have\r\nproduced disastrous economic consequences in some\r\ncountries.\r\nAs with the challenges of peace and democracy, it is\r\nour firm belief that sufficient resources exist within the\r\nworld economy actually to address the social progress and\r\nthe better life for all for which the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights calls. Further to this, science and technology\r\ncontinue to develop in such a way that it is difficult to\r\nbelieve that, taken together with the large concentrations of\r\ncapital that characterize the world economy, the means do\r\nnot exist within human society to make the required impact\r\non poverty, ignorance and disease. Indeed, it can be argued\r\nquite rationally that international peace, democracy and\r\nprosperity are a necessary condition for the further rapid\r\ngrowth of the world economy, and with it the further\r\nexpansion of the corporations, both small and big, which\r\nrequire global markets.\r\nSimilarly, the revolution in information and\r\ncommunication technology, a critical driver of the process\r\nof globalization, both enables and calls for higher levels of\r\neducation and standards of living among the billions who\r\nconstitute the human population. However, it is clear that\r\nthere is no automatic or inherent mechanism within the\r\noperation of the markets to enable both capital and\r\ntechnology to make the sort of impact we are talking about\r\non all countries of the globe. When we say this we should\r\nnot be taken to mean that we are contemptuous of all that\r\nhas been said about what each country needs to do to create\r\nthe conditions conducive to investment and technology\r\ntransfers. Nor should it be taken to mean that we are\r\nreopening the debate about the role of markets in the\r\nallocation of resources. What we are saying is that the\r\nfunctioning of the markets does not and cannot exclude\r\nconscious interventions being made, both to increase\r\neconomic opportunities and to raise the standards of living\r\nand the life possibilities of many in the world denied their\r\nhuman dignity by the scourge of poverty.\r\nIn his interesting book Living on Thin Air, the\r\nBritish author Charles Leadbeater, writes:\r\n“The new (knowledge driven) economy needs a\r\nmobilizing vision and institutions fashioned to make\r\nit real. Bit by bit, our institutions are changing\r\nthrough reform, reorganisation and restructuring —\r\nbut the process is much too slow, haphazard and\r\npiecemeal — it must become more conscious,\r\nimaginative and radical.”\r\nOnce more, the matter turns on the will of the\r\npolitical leaders actually to discover among themselves\r\nthe moral and intellectual courage to do what is correct\r\nand necessary. What is correct and necessary also requires\r\nthat in this field as well, which affects socio-economic\r\nmatters, we should review the functioning of all\r\nmultilateral institutions, including those that belong within\r\nthe United Nations family. This should be done to ensure\r\nthat these too reflect the very necessary imperative of the\r\ndemocratization of the international system of governance.\r\nThe United Nations documents to which we referred\r\nearlier give us a starting point. Accordingly, we believe\r\nthat there is no need for anyone among us to rediscover\r\na new vision that would inform our actions to build a new\r\nworld which affirms the dignity and worth of the human\r\nperson. What is necessary is that we match the beliefs we\r\nprofess with the necessary action.\r\nWe speak of action that will practically address the\r\nrelated issues of peace, democracy and development.\r\nI am certain that such a practical programme of\r\naction would meet the aspirations not only of the\r\nmembers of the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, of which we are a member. It\r\nwould also respond to the most deep-seated feelings of\r\nthe peoples of the developed North, who can have no\r\ninterest in conflict, oppression and poverty, even if these\r\noccur beyond the borders of their own countries.\r\nIt also goes without saying that the democratic\r\nsystems in which we operate would also require that,\r\nthrough committed advocacy, we should secure the\r\nsupport of the electors for what should be a programme\r\nof action of the United Nations for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nThe evolution of human society has presented the\r\nworld leaders who will stand at this rostrum with new\r\npossibilities to move our globe a giant step forward towards\r\na new actuality, of which the poor and the powerless dream\r\nevery day. We will be betraying those millions if we do not\r\nact to turn their dream into reality. Let future generations\r\nnot say that because of the force of inertia we failed to act.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic of Algeria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic of Algeria.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bouteflika (spoke in Arabic): So it is\r\nAfrica, through two of its most devoted and eminent sons,\r\nthat has the particular honour of leading the United Nations\r\ninto the new millennium. I refer to you, Mr. President, a\r\nworthy freedom fighter for our sister nation, Namibia; I\r\nnow salute your well-deserved election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly. I refer also to Mr. Kofi Annan, our\r\nSecretary-General, to whom the international community is\r\nindebted for the great perseverance and fervour he has\r\nshown in his promotion of the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter and in strengthening the role of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI am very moved to address this Assembly, because,\r\nby electing me 25 years ago to the presidency at its twenty-\r\nninth session, the General Assembly was even then showing\r\nits esteem for and interest in Africa and its consideration\r\nfor all of those generations of freedom fighters who, like\r\nthose of my country, have assumed the historic\r\nresponsibility of making a decisive contribution to the\r\nadvent of a better world. Twenty-five years have passed\r\nduring which the inexorable movement towards freedom\r\nhas followed its course, toppling the last bastions of\r\ncolonialism and racial segregation, and enshrining the\r\nright to sovereign equality of States and the right of\r\npeoples to development, self-determination and\r\nindependence.\r\nAt the same time, a new situation has emerged\r\nmarked by greater interdependence between nations,\r\nwhich, as they have gradually become more and more\r\naware of the unity of their destinies, can no longer afford\r\nto live in isolation nor remain indifferent or insensitive\r\nwhen something happens to one of their members.\r\nI have therefore come to speak about this common\r\ndestiny, on behalf of Africa and Algeria, at a time when\r\nour session has chosen the theme of the culture of peace\r\nand non-violence. Throughout this century, the world has\r\nconstantly evolved, created, destroyed, reinvented itself\r\nand moved forward. Despite ideological conflicts and\r\neconomic crises, political tensions and devastating wars,\r\nhumanity has made its way inexorably towards one and\r\nthe same history — one and the same destiny.\r\nNew challenges are today confronting the\r\ninternational community in a context occasioned by the\r\neasing of ideological struggles, the end of the cold war\r\nand the creation of a unipolar world, with its inherent\r\nparadoxes for development.\r\nOne of these challenges is what is today called\r\nglobalization: a global economy, a global political system,\r\neven global values and aspirations — but also, global\r\nproblems and dangers. In any case, implementation of\r\nglobalization is encountering a variety of barriers and\r\nobstacles. On the economic side, unequal development\r\nbetween nations certainly does not facilitate the\r\nestablishment of a universally accepted new world order.\r\nWorrying gaps are beginning to appear, especially in\r\nAfrica: a chronic deterioration in the terms of trade; a\r\ncrushing weight of debt; fratricidal conflicts;\r\nenvironmental degradation; increasing unemployment;\r\npersistent epidemics; falling numbers of children in\r\nschool; declining official development assistance and\r\nmeagre direct investment. Furthermore, two thirds of the\r\nleast developed countries and three quarters of the low-\r\nincome countries are in Africa. In addition, 50 per cent of\r\nthe continent’s population live in abject poverty.\r\nThe thirty-fifth Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) Summit showed that Africans were ready to face\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nup to this miserable situation by working for peace, stability\r\nand cooperation and by entrenching political and economic\r\nreform more firmly. But it also revealed how insubstantial\r\nNorth-South cooperation is, showing that it is often limited\r\nby policies based on vested interests or selective\r\nintervention.\r\nThe Summit also pointed out the difficulties inherent\r\nin the social, cultural and psychological structure of our\r\ncountries, with many misunderstandings resulting from the\r\nmechanical application of criteria adopted in developed\r\ncountries not only in the economic but also in the political\r\nand cultural areas.\r\nThe problems which have still to be solved are\r\ntherefore numerous, and the international community sees\r\nthem every day in Africa, Asia, the Balkans and the Middle\r\nEast. To these problems must be added the global\r\ncontroversy between the champions of an optimistic\r\nuniversality that easily tolerates the advent of and\r\nadjustment to a unipolar world, and those who retain a\r\nsense of their own identity and consider, rightly, that the\r\ninterests of mankind lie in constructing a multipolar world.\r\nThese problems do not, however, mean that all hopes\r\nfor harmonious globalization are purely utopian: they\r\nmerely represent obstacles to an evolution which we know\r\nis unavoidable. What would be an illusion, however, would\r\nbe globalization of the impossible, globalization that ignores\r\nthe legitimate interests of humankind as a whole, because\r\nsooner or later that would be doomed to failure. The\r\nglobalization of problems is a fact of life; that is why it is\r\nimperative for us to find global solutions.\r\nIt cannot be overemphasized how discouraging it is to\r\nsee such a constantly widening gap between rich and poor\r\nand between rich countries and Third World countries that\r\nare stifled by debt. I certainly do not intend to complain to\r\nthe Assembly about the many upheavals of a “Third\r\nWorldism” whose approach and methods are at least 20\r\nyears old and have become obsolete. The world is no\r\nlonger as it was in the 1970s; it has changed radically. It\r\nseems to me, however, that this movement towards\r\npluralism and the market economy should be continued and\r\nencouraged, and that it should be accompanied by a\r\nmovement towards solidarity. In fact, I believe that the\r\nlogic of power and confrontation that has marked the\r\ntwentieth century should give way to a logic of solidarity\r\nthat will make international relations more humane, based\r\non fair exchange and shared prosperity.\r\nThe progress of nations would be incomplete if we\r\nrestricted ourselves to seeking it solely through the\r\nmarket. We must also continue to seek it simply by\r\npromoting the most basic human rights. In sharing the\r\nidea of human rights, it must be made clear that the\r\ndefinition and observance of human rights must take into\r\naccount the context of each of our States, with their\r\ndiffering traditions, social structures and priorities. For us,\r\nhuman rights are balanced by the duties of the citizen and\r\ngoverned by inescapable priorities. Apart from the\r\nstruggle against poverty, disease and illiteracy — ensuring\r\nthat every human being has the right to a decent and\r\ndignified life — is it not true that human rights also mean\r\nthe protection of society from terrorism, drug traffickers\r\nand purveyors of death of every kind? In this respect,\r\nthere are no discrepancies between our concerns and those\r\nof the developed world on the issue of democracy and\r\nhuman rights. Nevertheless, it remains true that these are\r\nissues of utmost importance and highest priority.\r\nThis is why we believe that the idea of the progress\r\nof the human race, and its emergence into the twenty-first\r\ncentury through the adoption of the laws of the free\r\nmarket, freedom of investment and other freedoms, cannot\r\nbe separated from its progress through development aid\r\nand solidarity with Third World countries. In other words,\r\nour interest should be focused on the renewal of\r\ninternational action within the United Nations system so\r\nas to adapt it to the new world contexts, to help it\r\nrespond to the legitimate expectations of the great\r\nmajority of nations and to bring about renewed progress\r\ntowards peace, stability, equity and shared prosperity.\r\nI come from a continent where people need to have\r\nfaith in justice, because they believe that the countries\r\nwhich exploited their resources to ensure their own\r\ndevelopment have a heavy debt to repay. They need to\r\nbelieve that, having given so much to building human\r\ncivilization in the modern era, they have the right to\r\ndemand that their dignity and their humanity should be\r\nfully respected. I seek also to remind this Assembly that,\r\nby letting poverty proliferate in a world which is\r\nbecoming increasingly interdependent, the rich countries\r\nand the community of nations are paving the way for\r\ndisruptions in national life and for international relations\r\nthat will be increasingly susceptible to threats of violence,\r\nconflict and discord, which are harmful to democracy and\r\nto economic activity.\r\nI also wish to recall that the failure of the Third\r\nWorld, and of Africa in particular, to make itself heard —\r\na failure reflected in the results of the Uruguay Round —\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\ndoes not augur well for solutions to all the problems that I\r\nhave mentioned. Does our degeneration mean that we are\r\nirrevocably doomed to decline, and that the poverty of the\r\nmajority is irremediably bound to dominate the coming\r\ncentury? I prefer not to believe that that is the case; I prefer\r\nto believe rather that recovery is possible so long as\r\nconcerted and sustained action is taken in parallel with\r\naction by the United Nations.\r\nSuch action must have two tiers. The first tier lies\r\nwith the industrialized countries because the solution to the\r\nThird World’s problems is in their hands, as the Managing\r\nDirector of the International Monetary Fund rightly stated\r\nover ten years ago: they have sufficient economic, financial\r\nand legislative leverage to initiate reform and to restore an\r\nenvironment conducive to growth for the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe second tier lies with the developing countries\r\nthemselves, which must take on the essential task of\r\nbecoming self-reliant by organizing their entry into the\r\nworld economy and by following through with economic\r\nand political reforms. Unfortunately, they have no other\r\nchoice.\r\nIt is against this background that Africans met last\r\nJuly in Algiers, where the thirty-fifth Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Summit was held. During this\r\nmeeting, which enjoyed a record number of participants,\r\nAfricans took stock of their achievements since\r\nindependence, weighed up current reforms in the light of\r\nexternal forces and internal realities and laid down the\r\nfoundations of a new approach to and a new vision of the\r\nfuture of the continent. Priority was given to concord and\r\npeace in Africa. Africa is determined to speed up the\r\nsettlement of the conflicts between Eritrea and Ethiopia and\r\nin the Great Lakes region, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Sierra Leone. Activities within OAU and the\r\nsubregional organizations have been intensified towards\r\nrestoring peace and putting an end to the suffering of the\r\nrefugees.\r\nSimilarly, Africa has unequivocally stated that it\r\nsupports international legality, democracy and respect for\r\nlaw, and accordingly it has set out the guidelines for the\r\nOAU position on the situations in Angola and in Western\r\nSahara. It fully supports the United Nations initiatives there,\r\nas it does the OAU good offices in the Comoros, where it\r\nhopes that the Comoran people will proceed with\r\ndemocratic elections for their institutions so as to preserve\r\nthe country’s unity and territorial integrity.\r\nA concern for peace and concord also underlies\r\nAfrica’s assessment of the Middle East peace process,\r\nwhich it hopes will come to a comprehensive, fair and\r\nlasting solution based on withdrawal by Israel from the\r\nterritories unjustly occupied by it and on its recognition\r\nof the Palestinian people’s legitimate and inalienable\r\nrights.\r\nOAU is similarly concerned about peace and security\r\nin the Gulf, where economic sanctions that are disastrous\r\nfor the affected populations should be lifted, as should\r\nthose unjustly imposed against Libya and Sudan even\r\nthough their Governments have fully cooperated with the\r\nrelevant investigations.\r\nThe human race must enter the new millennium free\r\nof the disputes born of the historical vicissitudes of the\r\ntormented and tragic century now drawing to its close. In\r\nthis context, hotbeds of tension and crises must be\r\neliminated. The suffering of peoples who are still unable\r\nto exercise their right to self-determination and\r\nindependence must end. The embargo imposed on the\r\nIraqi people must be resolved in a less harmful way, as\r\nour Secretary-General of OAU would say, in keeping\r\nwith United Nations resolutions. Terrorism, organized\r\ncrime, drug and arms trafficking — which undermine\r\nrelations between States and weaken peaceful and fruitful\r\ninternational cooperation — must be a top priority. New,\r\nethical international relations should also be prioritized in\r\norder to usher in a new era of peace and common\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe Algiers Summit, however, did not restrict itself\r\nto expressing, clearly, Africa’s desire to bring to an end\r\nthe tragic phase of conflicts which are tearing it apart,\r\nand to go along, step by step, with the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to institute a just and long-lasting\r\npeace everywhere in the world. The Summit also studied\r\neconomic and development issues within the framework\r\nof the Abuja Treaty, consolidating macroeconomic\r\nreforms through the revival of sustained growth and\r\nthrough regional integration within the framework of\r\nAfrican unity, the principle of which has just been\r\nenshrined by the Sirte special Summit.\r\nThe Sirte Summit reaffirmed OAU solidarity with\r\nand support for fraternal Libya concerning the need for a\r\nfinal lifting of the unfair embargo imposed upon it. It\r\ndecided also to establish new rules and norms to facilitate\r\nthe development of operational structures and modalities\r\nfor OAU with a view to achieving effective union\r\nbetween the countries of Africa. Such a union will\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nguarantee Africa’s security and strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween its peoples, which will gain Africa the respect and\r\nstatus it deserves in the light of the heavy cost it has paid\r\nthroughout history in sacrifice, slavery, exploitation and\r\ndespoliation during the colonial era. Such a union will also\r\npromote Africa’s material and human potential and all that\r\nmakes it so different from the rest of the world. In short,\r\nthe Sirte Summit has reaffirmed in full the right of Africa\r\nto be an active part of the globalization process. As a\r\nresult, justice will be equal for all, and the new concepts\r\nintroduced by globalization will be immunized against any\r\nform of injustice, abuse or exclusion.\r\nThe Summit also affirmed the necessity of advancing\r\nnew reforms in the context of cooperation and partnership\r\nbetween the United Nations and OAU in all fields. Lastly,\r\nthe Summit proposed a new ethics for international\r\nrelations, where the requirements of production and\r\ncompetition should obscure neither the higher interest of\r\nhumanity — whose very existence is under threat from all\r\nkinds of environmental degradation and other scourges\r\naffecting the natural world, humankind and human values\r\nand institutions — nor the rights of nation States to their\r\nintegrity and sovereignty.\r\nWe do not deny the right of northern-hemisphere\r\npublic opinion to denounce the breaches of human rights\r\nwhere they exist. Nor do we deny that the United Nations\r\nhas the right and the duty to help suffering humanity. But\r\nwe remain extremely sensitive to any undermining of our\r\nsovereignty not only because sovereignty is our final\r\ndefence against the rules of an unjust world, but because\r\nwe have no active part in the decision-making process in\r\nthe Security Council nor in monitoring the implementation\r\nof decisions.\r\nFurthermore, inasmuch as the sovereign state remains\r\nbeyond dispute a place of social contract and the context\r\nwithin which human rights should be organized — political\r\nrights, as well as economic and social ones — the\r\ninternational community should favour stability as well as\r\nconcord and the culture of democracy for our developing\r\ncountries. But all this will remain a dream so long as the\r\nreal issues at stake, those of economic and social\r\ndevelopment, have not been clearly set out, because, for\r\nAfrica as for other continents, these issues are the crux of\r\nthe matter.\r\nThe debate on the concept of interference in internal\r\naffairs consequently seems far from over, as at least three\r\nquestions require exact answers: first, where does aid stop\r\nand interference begin? Second, where are the lines to be\r\ndrawn between the humanitarian, the political and the\r\neconomic? Third, is interference valid only in weak or\r\nweakened States or for all States without distinction? In\r\nany event, we firmly believe that interference in internal\r\naffairs may take place only with the consent of the State\r\nin question. We firmly believe that the countries of the\r\nSouth are capable of overcoming their difficulties, so long\r\nas solidarity, loyal assistance and the concern of the\r\ndeveloped countries and the international community do\r\nnot fail them.\r\nAlgeria has paid a very heavy price for democracy,\r\nand like other African countries must shoulder the high\r\nsocial cost of the reforms which it is undertaking. It has\r\nembarked upon a vast project of national renewal. It is\r\nworking hard to ensure civil concord, enhance democracy,\r\nestablish the rule of law and renew and modernize its\r\njudicial system and administration. In short, we are\r\nworking to create conditions for the best possible use of\r\nthe country’s economic potential and for individual and\r\ncollective well-being in a society where peace has been\r\nrestored and where free enterprise, justice and dignity are\r\nguaranteed for all.\r\nThis is an enormous undertaking, but a necessary\r\none after a decade of ordeals in what was a war in\r\neverything but name — a war that was inflicted on us,\r\nand which allowed terrorism and extremism to do\r\nviolence against society, values, dignity and people’s\r\nconsciences. My country is re-emerging, slowly, from\r\nthese tragic events, which were foreign to Islam. Many\r\nthings have been said in various forums about this ordeal\r\nwhich engulfed my country — most often, alas, by people\r\nwho are hostile to or who have only a superficial\r\nknowledge of Algerian society and its problems. I will\r\nrefrain here from condemning anyone’s opinions, but I do\r\nbelieve that when a people has been exposed to a tragedy\r\nlike the one in Algeria, for a whole decade, and has faced\r\nup to it with the courage and tenacity which the Algerian\r\npeople have shown, then that people should at the least\r\nhave the right to use its own Republic’s institutions to\r\ndefend itself.\r\nYes, my country has been wounded — the very\r\nflesh of its children has been wounded. Tens of thousands\r\nof them are dead — some victims of fanaticism, some\r\nvictims of others’ madness. In general terms, people have\r\nbeen victimized by the general confusion that nearly\r\nbrought the Republic to its knees, hence Algeria’s\r\noverwhelming desire to defend its existence.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nIn this context of passions unleashed, disorder, the\r\ninstinct for murder, the marginalization of society,\r\ndevastating nihilism and blood and tears, men, women and\r\nchildren have lived through untold suffering and the\r\ncountry’s infrastructure has been flagrantly and blindly\r\ndestroyed, with extremely negative effects on our economy.\r\nToday the Algerian people are licking their wounds.\r\nThe main thrust of our national recovery is civil concord;\r\nthis shows the innate magnanimity of our people and our\r\nunshakeable commitment to the lofty values of tolerance\r\nwhich characterize true Islam. Today, the Algerian people\r\nare rejecting violence because it is not part of our tradition.\r\nThey are committed to pivotal human rights, as they were\r\nduring their struggle for independence and during the\r\nbuilding of their country. They proved this in the\r\nreferendum of 16 September by saying a resounding \"yes\"\r\nto the law on civil concord adopted by the Parliament in\r\nJuly. They proved this also by opening their hearts and\r\nextending the hand of generosity to those who had defied\r\nsociety and the laws of the Republic. They are proving it\r\nthrough their reliance on the law, itself increasingly inspired\r\nby the lofty ideals of the State of law and which, without\r\nbeing repressive, may not be broken by anyone, including\r\nthe State. They have proved it because, true to their own\r\nselves, they know that peace and solidarity alone are the\r\nkeys to economic and social progress.\r\nThe principles which we are recommending in\r\ninternational relations we are also resolutely endeavouring\r\nto implement at home, on a national level. With the\r\nrestoration of peace, we shall consolidate all freedoms. We\r\nwill irreversibly establish a culture of democracy and\r\npluralism. We are currently committed to eliminating all\r\nbureaucratic obstacles to free economic activity throughout\r\nthe country, endeavouring in this way to establish the rules\r\nof social liberalism and the market economy.\r\nOn a regional level, we are pursuing negotiations with\r\nthe European Union on an association agreement and on the\r\nBarcelona process. We shall spare no effort in relaunching\r\nthe project to construct an Arab Maghreb Union on the\r\nbasis of renewed inspiration, rational action and realistic\r\naims established in such a way as to ensure a viable,\r\nreliable and long-lasting institution. Like other countries,\r\nAlgeria will pursue its negotiations to become a member of\r\nthe World Trade Organization. On an African level, it will\r\nwork unceasingly towards the advancement of the economic\r\nintegration agreements reached within the framework of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity; to settle the conflicts that\r\nare tearing the continent apart; and to promote long-lasting\r\npeace, which is favourable to sustained development.\r\nIn short, Algeria believes that in order to contribute\r\nin a useful manner to the future of the world, the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts, international stability, solidarity\r\nbetween nations and equity in international relations,\r\nAlgeria must adapt to the economic and political realities\r\nof this world, modernize, reinforce and liberalize the\r\ngeneral framework within which its economy operates,\r\nencourage private investment and ensure equal\r\nopportunity for all its citizens while ensuring their human\r\ndevelopment. This comprehensive and coherent action\r\nwill be taken by my country in order to adapt to the way\r\nthe world is now, so that it can succeed and so that it can\r\ngain its rightful place among the nations of the world, a\r\nplace we first won thanks to our tradition of support for\r\nthe ideals of this Organization.\r\nAlgeria is slowly but surely beginning to get back on\r\nits feet. It has entered a period of convalescence. It has\r\ndone so thanks to its people’s potential, vitality and\r\nenergy and, thanks also to the solidarity shown by many\r\nsister nations and friends throughout the world. From this\r\nrostrum let me express the Algerian people’s deep\r\ngratitude for and recognition of that solidarity.\r\nWe are at the end of one century and on the\r\nthreshold of the next. We are at the end of one\r\nmillennium and on the threshold of another. I share to\r\nsome extent the belief that these milestones of our era do\r\nhave an impact on the life and evolution of the human\r\nrace.\r\nThe twentieth century has had its moments of glory,\r\nnotably in bringing colonialism to an end, in combating\r\nracism and in eliminating apartheid. But it has also had\r\nits setbacks and failures, manifested in persistent\r\nunderdevelopment, in the not always successful struggle\r\nto eliminate poverty and in the never-ending quest for\r\nbetter concord between peoples.\r\nWill we draw enough inspiration from these\r\nmilestones to turn around mindsets that still rigidly abide\r\nby outdated concepts of international life? Will we be\r\nable to hold out a fraternal hand to each other so that\r\nwell-being can be better shared out in the world? Will we\r\nbe capable of preparing a world for future generations\r\nthat is better than the one in which we live? We can\r\nanswer all these questions with a “yes”, and it is with\r\nthese optimistic words of hope that I conclude my\r\nstatement.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic of Algeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the People’s\r\nRepublic of Algeria, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of the Republic\r\nof Namibia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Sam Nujoma, President of the Republic of\r\nNamibia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Sam Nujoma, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Nujoma: Mr. President, the United Nations\r\nis no foreign territory to you. For 14 difficult and\r\nchallenging years, you valiantly waged a diplomatic\r\nstruggle at the United Nations for the freedom of our\r\npeople and the independence of our country. Your sterling\r\npersonal efforts and unflinching commitment could not be\r\nbetter crowned. The people of the Republic of Namibia are\r\nvery proud to see you preside over the fifty-fourth session\r\nof the General Assembly. On their behalf and indeed on my\r\nown, I express our deep gratitude to all United Nations\r\nMember States for electing you President at this session.\r\nMr. President, as you assume this very important\r\noffice, you follow in the memorable footsteps of Mongi\r\nSlim of Tunisia, Alex Quaison-Sackey of Ghana,\r\nAngie E. Brooks of Liberia, Abdelaziz Bouteflika of\r\nAlgeria, Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania, Paul J. F. Lusaka\r\nof Zambia, Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria and Amara Essy of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire. These distinguished sons and daughters of\r\nAfrica presided over the General Assembly between 1961\r\nand 1994. They did Africa proud and they served the\r\ninternational community well. You should heed the views\r\nof all United Nations Member States, large and small, rich\r\nand poor. In that way, you will have maintained and\r\nadvanced even further the integrity and importance of this\r\nmost representative organ of the United Nations, the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I assure you, Mr. President, that you\r\ncan always count on the loyal and unqualified support of\r\nthe Namibian delegation.\r\nDuring your term of office, you will be flanked by\r\nanother illustrious and committed son of Africa, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, one who hails from Ghana, a country which lit\r\nthe torch of Africa’s decolonization. To you,\r\nMr. Secretary-General of the United Nations, I express\r\nmy Government’s fullest support. The Government and\r\nthe people of Namibia particularly commend you for your\r\ndetermined efforts aimed at promoting the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts and bringing relief to the needy in\r\nAfrica and elsewhere in the world.\r\nI wish to add my voice to that of the current\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nmy brother and colleague, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika\r\nof the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria. He\r\nplaced the demands and expectations of the African\r\npeople before this body, as well as their resolve to face\r\nup to the challenges which confront Africa. Guided by the\r\nspirit of the recent OAU summit held in Algiers,\r\nPresident Bouteflika talked about a continent which is\r\nconfronted by development constraints, but whose people\r\nhave not lost hope: a people who are industrious, but\r\nwhose efforts to make Africa achieve its potential are\r\nbeing impeded by social and economic problems. It is\r\nsome of these challenges that I wish to address.\r\nToday, economic disparity, debt burden, social\r\ninjustice, unemployment, refugee problems and\r\nenvironmental degradation have become unacceptable\r\nhardships in various regions of the world. One may ask\r\nwhether these burdens of deprivation have become a\r\nstatus quo for the majority of people in the developing\r\ncountries? Have we concluded that there are not enough\r\nresources to educate every woman, man and child in this\r\nworld and to keep them healthy and productive? Can all\r\nthe technological achievements that are now at our\r\ndisposal not be put at the service of all humanity? Words\r\nof reason have been spoken, saying that those who are\r\naffluent today owe their tomorrow to those who live in\r\ndeprivation.\r\nIt has been argued that the solution to\r\nunderdevelopment is globalization and liberalization of\r\nthe world economy. This forces all of us to be equal,\r\nwhile, in fact, we are not. I believe that for globalization\r\nto work it must be transformed from a mere concept into\r\nreality. It must be a collective undertaking for the benefit\r\nof all. It is only logical and, indeed, morally right that no\r\nman, woman or child should go hungry while others are\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nbasking in prosperity. Globalization should not amount to\r\nprotected and selective prosperity. If so, international peace\r\nand stability will be jeopardized. As long as over a billion\r\npeople live in abject poverty, lack access to clean drinking\r\nwater and do not know how to read and write at all, the\r\nbenefit of globalization will not be universal. And the\r\nreality of inequality of States must be at the centre of any\r\ndiscussions of the world economy. The United Nations can\r\nand should help developing countries to maximize the\r\nbenefits from a globalized economy.\r\nThe biggest menace of the twentieth century has been\r\nthe unacceptably high and ever-increasing poverty that\r\ndenudes humanity of its dignity. I wish to recall that among\r\nthe commitments made during the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen in 1995, was the\r\ncommitment to halve poverty levels by 2015. Sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica requires a growth rate of 7 per cent annually if we\r\nare to achieve those levels. The future looks bleak, but the\r\ndetermination is strong to overcome all odds and succeed.\r\nAfrica carries 10 per cent of the world’s population,\r\nbut produces only 1 per cent of the world’s gross domestic\r\nproduct. Foreign direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa is\r\nestimated at a meagre 3 per cent of all total foreign direct\r\ninvestment. With most of the least developed countries\r\nbeing in Africa, this vast, rich but underdeveloped continent\r\ncontinues to challenge our Organization. Poverty and\r\ndisease have all become much talked about to depict the\r\nsituation in many parts of Africa. Armed conflicts in\r\nvarious parts of Africa continue to strip our continent of its\r\nhuman and natural resources. This overshadows the overall\r\nachievements that Africa continues to make. Africa today\r\nis democratizing and undertaking economic reform to\r\nmaximize social and economic prosperity for its people.\r\nAnd, indeed, some significant economic growth has been\r\nrecorded in a large number of countries.\r\nHowever, political and economic reforms in\r\nthemselves will not deliver sustained economic growth.\r\nIncreased foreign direct investment is very important to\r\ncomplement these reforms and to sustain the current growth\r\nrate. Only then can the lives of the African people improve.\r\nLet me emphasize that foreign direct investment should not\r\nreplace official development aid. In the short term, foreign\r\naid will be a necessary complement to Africa’s own efforts\r\nfor recovery and development of its people.\r\nIn 1990 I attended the World Summit for Children,\r\nhere at the United Nations, as the newly elected President\r\nof the Republic of Namibia. I feel proud to say that we\r\nwere among the first countries in Africa to complete our\r\nnational programme of action for the implementation of\r\nthe Summit’s outcome. Our Parliament ratified — and, in\r\nfact, most of Africa has ratified — the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child, whose tenth anniversary we are about\r\nto commemorate. This embodies the legal standard with\r\nwhich we should comply in ensuring that children reach\r\ntheir fullest potential. Yet, to our dismay, too many\r\nchildren are being denied their childhood.\r\nWhen a child is subjected to armed conflict, with\r\neach and every right being taken away, then that child is\r\nplaced on an equal footing with adults. And when that\r\ncourse takes effect, then, regrettably, society has stooped\r\nto its lowest and the rest of humanity cannot and should\r\nnot stand idly by. We can and must prevent conflicts\r\nfrom occurring, so as to create an environment in which\r\nall children can live, play and grow up under safe\r\nconditions. Only through a culture of peace can we\r\ncombat all forms of child exploitation and, in particular,\r\nput an end to the phenomenon of child soldiers.\r\nI would therefore like to stress that if every square\r\nmetre of land that is inaccessible because of landmines\r\ncould once again become productive, many children,\r\nespecially in Africa, would be spared from hunger. And\r\nif every child soldier in Africa carrying a gun can be\r\nturned into a student, Africa’s future will have been\r\nsecured.\r\nOn the eve of the new millennium, we can all look\r\nback with pride on the fact that humankind has made\r\nmajor strides towards the betterment of the living\r\nconditions of millions across the world. The information\r\nsuperhighway has changed for ever the way we do\r\nbusiness. Much of the world is now fully connected\r\nthrough the Internet.\r\nNotwithstanding all this, much of Africa is still\r\nstruggling to gain meaningful access to knowledge and\r\ninformation. In addition to our efforts to become more\r\n“wired”, we are now faced with the enormous challenge\r\nof ensuring that our countries are all Y2K-compliant\r\nbefore 31 December 1999, in order to avert disaster.\r\nNamibia calls on all those countries which have the\r\nresources and the necessary know-how to assist\r\ndeveloping countries in dealing with this problem. The\r\ninternational community needs to share knowledge\r\nbecause it is mutually beneficial. Developed countries\r\nhave nothing to lose and everything to gain by sharing\r\ninformation technology with the developing countries.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is eroding the socio-\r\neconomic and developmental gains that many African\r\ncountries have made. HIV/AIDS has been rated the\r\nnumber-one killer in many countries, including Namibia.\r\nMy Government adopted a National Strategic Plan on\r\nHIV/AIDS for the period 1999-2004. The aim of our\r\nnational plan is to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS\r\nsignificantly by strengthening efforts towards prevention\r\nand control. In addition to the existing Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) regional programmes,\r\nwe have also undertaken other measures to ensure that there\r\nis no discrimination against all those living with HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe international community should assist the efforts of the\r\nAfrican Governments in the implementation of their\r\nnational programmes to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.\r\nNext June, we shall convene two special sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly to review the progress made by\r\nGovernments in the implementation of the commitments\r\nmade at the Fourth World Conference on Women and the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, respectively. Let us\r\nuse those opportunities to make equality among people a\r\nreality and social integration the norm, so that men and\r\nwomen can live together in equality and as partners.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed a number of\r\npositive developments in the field of disarmament.\r\nHowever, despite these developments, we remain concerned\r\nat the lack of tangible movement on the core issue of\r\nnuclear disarmament. The central problem is the\r\ndetermination by nuclear-weapon States, despite their\r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, to retain nuclear weapons indefinitely.\r\nThis is being done under the pretext that nuclear weapons\r\nare essential for national security. To make such a claim is\r\na clear invitation to other States to acquire nuclear weapons\r\nunder the same pretext, as by nature every State has its\r\nvital national security to protect. In practice, nuclear\r\nweapons have also become a means of exerting pressure on\r\nand blackmailing other countries. No State or group of\r\nStates should have a monopoly on nuclear weapons. This\r\nis a new type of apartheid, which is unacceptable today.\r\nIn this century, international peace and security have\r\nbeen challenged by the barbaric conduct of a few\r\nindividuals who have offended the very conscience of\r\nhumankind by committing heinous crimes. Namibia wishes\r\nto record its firm stand against all acts, methods and\r\npractices of terrorism and reiterates its unequivocal\r\ncondemnation of such acts. At the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) summit in Algiers, the African leaders\r\nadopted the OAU Convention on the Prevention and\r\nCombating of Terrorism. Its elimination therefore requires\r\nthe close cooperation of all United Nations Member\r\nStates. However, international cooperation in combating\r\nterrorism, and the measures adopted to combat it, must be\r\nbased on international law, the relevant international\r\nConventions and, above all, conducted in conformity with\r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council constitutes one\r\nof the important components in the efforts to strengthen,\r\nrevitalize and democratize the United Nations. The\r\ncomposition of the Security Council does not reflect the\r\nsubstantial increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations. Furthermore, it does not respect the principles of\r\nequitable geographical representation and the sovereign\r\nequality of States. In the existing Security Council,\r\nparticularly in the permanent members’ category,\r\ndeveloping countries are grossly under-represented. To\r\nmaintain such a situation is to erode the principle of\r\ndemocracy and fairness. Equally, a selective or partially\r\nreformed Council which overlooks the principles of equity\r\nand balance is against the spirit of the Charter.\r\nMy Government is therefore strongly in favour of\r\nthe position that we must correct the existing imbalances\r\nin the composition of the Security Council. It must\r\nbecome a democratic and truly representative institution,\r\nunfettered by the unfair tendencies and practices of the\r\npast.\r\nWe support the expansion of the Security Council in\r\nboth categories, permanent and non-permanent.\r\nDeveloping countries must adequately be represented in\r\na reformed and democratized Security Council. Africa\r\ndeserves at least two permanent seats and additional non-\r\npermanent seats in the expanded Council. Namibia, being\r\na member of the Non-Aligned Movement, supports a\r\nreformed Council of no less than 26 members. We do not\r\nsupport those who advocate a lesser number on the\r\nground of effectiveness.\r\nExperience has shown that the ineffectiveness or\r\ninaction of the Security Council has been due to the threat\r\nof veto by those who possess it, and not to the Council’s\r\nsize. As a matter of policy, Namibia is opposed to the\r\nveto, because of its undemocratic nature. It cannot even\r\nbe overridden by law or by procedures, as is the practice\r\nin democratic countries. The exercise of the veto\r\nperpetuates differences between members of the Council.\r\nIn some instances, it has greatly contributed to division\r\nand inaction in the Security Council. In other instances,\r\nit has even prolonged conflicts and human suffering. If\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nthe veto cannot be abolished now, its application should be\r\nprogressively curtailed until it is removed altogether.\r\nThe question of Palestine remains at the core of the\r\nproblem of the Middle East. Only when the inalienable\r\nrights of the Palestinian people are restored can there be\r\nlasting peace. We welcome the resumption of the peace\r\nnegotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. I\r\nreaffirm my Government’s unwavering political and\r\ndiplomatic support for the Palestinian people under the\r\nleadership of President Yasser Arafat.\r\nWith the end of the cold war nearly 10 years ago, we\r\nall expected to share in the peace dividend. In this\r\nconnection, it is regrettable that Cuba continues to be\r\nsubjected to a cruel economic, financial and commercial\r\nembargo, which must be lifted forthwith. Namibia calls for\r\nthe end of the embargo so that the people of Cuba can live\r\nin peace and prosperity with all their neighbours.\r\nThe people of East Timor have long yearned for their\r\nright to self-determination, freedom and independence. On\r\n30 August 1999 their dream to determine their own future\r\nwas overwhelmingly expressed in a referendum. The\r\ninternational community should assist the people of East\r\nTimor to complete the process towards statehood, peace,\r\nsecurity and development. We welcome the decision of the\r\nGovernment of Indonesia to invite the international\r\ncommunity, through the deployment of a United Nations\r\npeacekeeping force, to East Timor. We call on Indonesia to\r\ncooperate fully to ensure the success of that operation.\r\nWith regard to Western Sahara, my Government notes\r\nthe progress made towards the holding of a free and fair\r\nreferendum. We call on the parties, in particular the\r\nKingdom of Morocco, to cooperate with the United Nations\r\nso as to enable the Sahraoui people to exercise their right\r\nto self-determination.\r\nDespite the difficulties of the United Nations, my\r\nGovernment regards the Organization and its various\r\nagencies as the best possible instruments we have to\r\npromote world peace, international trade and increased\r\ncooperation. The admission of the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga has further\r\nstrengthened our Organization. Namibia congratulates them\r\nand welcomes them into our fold.\r\nIn the current international climate, the United Nations\r\nis the only voice which can bring peace to strife-torn areas,\r\nbring development to those regions where is it needed most\r\nand settle disputes between States. However, to carry out its\r\nmanifold tasks and duties effectively and efficiently, the\r\nUnited Nations needs money and resources from all\r\nMember States, without exception. In short, the United\r\nNations must embody the hopes and aspirations of\r\nhumankind and still reflect the realities of our times.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Namibia\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Sam Nujoma, President of the Republic of\r\nNamibia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, President of\r\nGeorgia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of Georgia.\r\nMr. Eduard Shevardnadze, President of Georgia,\r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of Georgia, His Excellency Mr. Eduard\r\nShevardnadze, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Shevardnadze (spoke in Georgian;\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I have stood\r\nupon this platform on many occasions, and I well\r\nremember every speech I have given here since 1985.\r\nThis is perhaps because, first, I cannot conceive of any\r\nloftier rostrum in the world and, secondly, because my\r\npersonal political fate has always brought me here at\r\ntimes of great change. My most recent appearance before\r\nthe General Assembly was in 1992, when I was already\r\nHead of State of my country, Georgia. That, too, was a\r\nmoment filled with drama — one in which a new,\r\nindependent State was going through a painful birth\r\nprocess.\r\nToday, I am with the Assembly at the end of a\r\nstormy century, one which I would call the century of\r\nfreedom. That is not because freedom has become a\r\nuniversal norm of life — regrettably, that is not yet the\r\ncase — but, rather, because the concept of freedom has\r\nassumed pre-eminence on the scale of political values and\r\nalso because it was, indeed, in our century that the worst\r\nenemies of freedom and democracy were defeated.\r\nPerhaps the most unanticipated and important of these\r\nevents was the demise of the Soviet empire, which\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nbrought about the end of the cold war, the bipolar world\r\nand the post-war world order.\r\nThe collapse of empires follows a more or less similar\r\npattern. Initially, centrifugal forces triumph, but later\r\nphantom pains for the lost territories begin to be felt in the\r\nmetropolis and attempts are made to recentralize the former\r\nimperial space.\r\nYet historical experience demonstrates that designs to\r\nrestore an empire inevitably remain the unfulfilled dream of\r\nimperial reactionaries. History cannot be turned back.\r\nHowever, in the arsenal of today’s reactionaries there\r\nremains still one chance to partially, if not completely,\r\nreturn to past ways — by maintaining spheres of influence\r\nover the territories of the former empire. Here I do not\r\nmean spheres of interest, including strategic interests.\r\nHarmonizing interests in a civilized way is a normal\r\ninternational practice. The concept of spheres of influence,\r\nhowever, particularly within the context of globalization,\r\nrepresents an anachronism.\r\nBut let me return to the demise of the cold war and\r\nthe bipolar world. As someone who happened to participate\r\nin this process, I think an explanation is in order since\r\ndebate on how and why it all happened continues to this\r\nday.\r\nI do not deny that the reasons for the end of the cold\r\nwar were many and complex. Yet I want to especially\r\nstress the role of the new thinking, which was conceived\r\neven before perestroika. I am certain that no drawn-out\r\neconomic hardships, not even any “Star Wars project”,\r\nwould have compelled the socialist camp to democratize\r\nwithin, or to take radical steps in the international arena to\r\novercome the confrontation, if instead of Mikhail\r\nGorbachev and his team, leaders who possessed the old\r\nmentality had remained at the helm of the Soviet ship of\r\nstate.\r\nSince I have mentioned Mikhail Gorbachev, I must\r\nsend to him, a man who is an outstanding figure of our\r\ntime, condolences for the death of his spouse, Raisa\r\nGorbachev.\r\nThe new thinking of that period contained many\r\nelements, but we can generally describe it as a concept\r\ndesigned to make all spheres of political and public life\r\nmore human.\r\nIn international relations, this implied, first and\r\nforemost, replacing the class-based ideological approach\r\nwith ethically motivated decisions, in line with universal\r\nvalues. Only due to this new approach were the countries\r\nof the Soviet space and Eastern Europe able to make their\r\ndemocratic choices with relatively little pain. Without the\r\nnew thinking it would have been difficult to conceive of\r\nthe withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan or that\r\ntruly epochal event, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the\r\nsubsequent reunification of Germany and the liberation of\r\nEastern Europe.\r\nThe old found it difficult to come to terms with the\r\nnew. The two could not exist harmoniously together.\r\nMoreover, not everyone accepted the idea of replacing the\r\nclass-based approach with the primacy of universal\r\nvalues. I remember that when I first expressed this\r\nconcept to the Soviet diplomatic corps, it spawned\r\naggressive clashes of opinion and upheaval across the\r\nentire Soviet space.\r\nBut has not this always been the case? Historically,\r\nchanges of this scale were always preceded by paradigm\r\nshifts in human thinking — that is, new thinking had to\r\noccur first. This was the case in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, when a new world based on\r\nscientific thinking was emerging, and also in the epoch of\r\nthe Enlightenment, during which the ideas of equality and\r\nhumanism gave birth to the theory and practice of a\r\ndemocratic state.\r\nIn the historical literature and memoirs dedicated to\r\nthe end of the cold war, one often finds references to\r\nwinners and losers. It is erroneous to frame this most\r\ncomplex event of global historical significance in such\r\nsimplistic terms. For example, how can Russia be\r\nconsidered to have been “defeated” when it set forth the\r\nexample to other peoples by creating its own independent\r\nState? One might ask the same about other States which\r\nbelonged to the so-called socialist camp and today are\r\nindependent democracies.\r\nCredit for the victory over the cold war equally\r\nbelongs to the representatives of the former opposing\r\ncamps who had in common the new thinking and a\r\ncommitment to the noble idea of saving mankind from a\r\nnuclear nightmare.\r\nIf we talk of any loser at all, it was the old, stagnant\r\nthinking which was defeated, and a new common sense\r\nprevailed. Shifts in thinking should occur at every stage\r\nof human development. The end of the cold war is a\r\nhighly significant intellectual breakthrough of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nThe process of renovation of ideas is perennial.\r\nStagnation is tantamount to backward motion. At the\r\nthreshold of the new millennium, it is necessary that we\r\nonce again develop a new thinking — new principles in the\r\nrelationship between States and a new approach to common\r\nproblems and threats.\r\nToday, nearly a decade after the Iron Curtain was\r\nlifted and the cold war came to an end, one often hears\r\nscepticism expressed about this great liberal democratic\r\nrevolution of the twentieth century. “What has changed,\r\nafter all?” some ask. Indeed, it is high time that we\r\nthoroughly assessed what has happened and surveyed the\r\nmyriad new opportunities that have presented themselves as\r\na result of this tectonic shift, as well as the far-from-simple\r\nproblems that up until now one would hardly ever think\r\nabout.\r\nMy ancient country, Georgia, is one of those newly\r\nindependent States which provide a good platform for\r\nobserving both the virtues and shortcomings of the\r\nprocesses under way in this new, post-bipolar world.\r\nAlthough the history of Georgian statehood stretches\r\nback more than three millennia, the vicissitudes of history\r\ncaused us to have to begin building our nation State from\r\nscratch once again in the last decade of this century. The\r\nbeginning proved especially difficult. The utter\r\nincompetence and inexperience of its first post-communist\r\nleadership threw Georgia into conflict and civil war. The\r\nresult was complete economic collapse and the loss of even\r\nthose token signs of statehood that we had inherited from\r\nthe Soviet system. Georgia in fact found itself isolated from\r\nthe rest of the world. All this was accompanied by an\r\nunprecedented criminal rampage the eradication of which\r\ntook several years.\r\nGeorgia began to work its way out of this isolation in\r\nthe spring of 1992 when it became a member of the United\r\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and began\r\nto actively forge diplomatic relations with its neighbours\r\nand more distant nations. In fact, it was during this difficult\r\nperiod that our country — its people and leadership —\r\nmade its choice. Georgia would set forth on the way\r\ntowards building a free and democratic society based on a\r\nsocially oriented market economy. Despite the serious\r\nbarriers that continued to emerge along the way, Georgia\r\nnever once departed from the course it set for itself.\r\nThe principles and practice of the construction of our\r\ndemocratic country did not go unnoticed by the\r\ninternational community. Under new conditions, when the\r\nbipolar confrontation was no more, international\r\norganizations were given the opportunity for their actions\r\nto span the entire globe, to help those States in need and\r\nto assist in their development. The United Nations, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the\r\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the\r\nEuropean Union and particularly the United States,\r\nGermany and Holland, as well as others, extended their\r\nhelp to us.\r\nThe year 1995 was indeed the turning point in\r\nGeorgia’s new era. With it came the adoption of a new\r\ndemocratic Constitution, as well as the holding of the first\r\nparliamentary and presidential elections. In the same year,\r\nwe achieved financial stability and introduced a new\r\nnational currency. At the end of that year, for the first\r\ntime in Georgia’s democratic development, growth in\r\ngross domestic product was recorded. Very importantly\r\nalso, law and order prevailed in the country, and the\r\nrampage of crime was finally curbed.\r\nIt was in the same year, however, 1995, that the first\r\nblast thundered. It was a terrorist act targeting Georgia’s\r\nhead of State. This barbaric act signalled to the world that\r\nnot everyone found Georgia’s progress towards\r\ndemocracy to their liking, especially if Georgia were to\r\nsucceed along the path of her choice.\r\nRecent years have demonstrated that the positive\r\ntrends in Georgia have become irreversible. From 1996 to\r\n1997, the annual economic growth was around 11 per\r\ncent, the exchange rate was stable and inflation continued\r\nto decline.\r\nNo less significant was the progress made in\r\nbuilding democratic institutions and putting in place and\r\nenforcing the legal framework for a civil society. In this\r\nrespect, it is no exaggeration to say that Georgia has\r\ntravelled in several short years a distance that often\r\nrequires decades. I am happy to say that as Georgia\r\ncontinues to improve its democratic institutions and\r\ndevelop its economy we are becoming a partner to others\r\nrather than merely a recipient of international aid. This is\r\nlargely made possible through the new function that my\r\ncountry has been establishing for itself over the past few\r\nyears.\r\nFor many decades the fuel-rich countries of the\r\nCaspian region and Central Asia were cut off from the\r\nrest of the world by impermeable walls. Now they have\r\nbegun to seek alternative routes to deliver their wealth to\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nthe world market. The south Caucasus, especially Georgia,\r\nwith its outlets to the Black Sea, has a pivotal location on\r\nthe route along which cargoes are already being shipped\r\nbetween east and west and between north and south. Since\r\nApril this year, oil has been flowing westward across the\r\nterritory of Georgia via the new Baku-Supsa pipeline. In\r\nancient times, Georgia was part of the great Silk Road. This\r\nfunction is reviving along with that vast highway that in\r\nancient times traversed the continents, bridging peoples and\r\npromoting the diffusion of cultures and the exchange of\r\nideas. I am referring to the great Eurasian space and\r\nrelevant transport routes.\r\nInternational organizations and individual countries\r\nhave shown great interest in the idea of a rebirth of the\r\ngreat Silk Road. The European Union initiated the\r\nTRACECA and INOGATE projects, under which the\r\nconstruction of the transport infrastructure is funded and\r\nmultiple alternative networks of oil and gas pipelines are\r\nbeing elaborated. The United States Senate recently adopted\r\nthe Silk Road strategy support bill, introduced by Senator\r\nBrownbeck, which envisages providing assistance to the\r\nsouth Caucasus and Central Asian States to strengthen\r\nindependence and democratic development, as well as to\r\nbuild a transport infrastructure that will include multiple oil\r\nand gas pipelines. In addition, the Japanese Government has\r\ndeveloped a strategy for the new Silk Road. China and\r\nother States are also participating in the realization of this\r\nproject. The countries of south Caucasus — Azerbaijan,\r\nArmenia and Georgia — signed partnership and cooperation\r\nagreements with the European Union that entered into force\r\nin June of this year. As for Georgia’s progress in building\r\na democratic society based on the rule of law and respect\r\nfor human rights, its accomplishments have been recognized\r\nby the Council of Europe, of which Georgia became a full-\r\nfledged member earlier this year.\r\nAs I said earlier, the modest successes we have\r\nenjoyed on the way towards independent development —\r\nthat is, our participation in projects of global significance\r\nand our aspiration to integrate with international, regional\r\nand Euro-Atlantic institutions — have irritated and continue\r\nto irritate the reactionary forces that are scattered across the\r\nentire territory of the former Soviet Union, where they pose\r\na serious threat to democratic regimes in the new States,\r\nincluding Russia.\r\nThe terrorist blast of 1995 was not an isolated\r\nincident. It was followed by other provocations and terrorist\r\nacts, which included another attempt on the President’s life.\r\nWill these attempts to force Georgia’s deviation from its\r\nchosen path continue? We cannot rule this out, since\r\ngeopolitical shifts of this scale never proceed smoothly.\r\nThe enemies of our country use the entire arsenal at their\r\ndisposal, including buying politicians and even votes, in\r\nattempting to bring to power a regime that is more to\r\ntheir liking.\r\nIn the current conditions of globalization and\r\nincreased interdependence, no country is immune to the\r\ncontagion of economic crisis. Last year independent\r\nGeorgia experienced first hand the repercussions of the\r\nnegative global economic situation, especially when the\r\nfinancial crisis erupted in neighbouring Russia, which\r\ncontinues to play a major part in Georgia’s foreign trade\r\noperations. Today we can claim with reasonable\r\nconfidence that Georgia’s young market economy and\r\nbanking system passed this test worthily, and international\r\norganizations and friendly countries made major\r\ncontributions to our ability to survive.\r\nUnresolved conflicts and our violated territorial\r\nintegrity remain Georgia’s most painful problem — in\r\nother words, the very problem which is among the series\r\nof new threats that the international community has\r\nshown itself unprepared to deal with. As a result of the\r\ncampaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing conducted by\r\nAbkhaz separatists, with external military support, many\r\ncivilians of Georgian and other ethnic extractions have\r\nbeen killed, and nearly 300,000 people have been\r\ndisplaced. Despite the aid that our Government, the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\nand other organizations provide, these innocent victims\r\ncontinue to live in conditions of extreme deprivation.\r\nThese severely traumatized people, who have been\r\nsubjected to inhuman brutalities, demand protection of\r\ntheir most inalienable right: the right to live in their own\r\nhomes. It is unfortunate that, unlike the confrontation in\r\nthe Balkans, the Abkhaz conflict has been given no\r\nexposure on world television screens, and therefore the\r\ninternational community has little awareness of it. Having\r\nseen with my own eyes the brutalities committed there, I\r\nhave no doubt whatsoever that people infected by the\r\ngerm of hatred lose their humanity and behave in the\r\nsame barbaric manner, be it in Kosovo, Rwanda or\r\nAbkhazia.\r\nIt is difficult to believe what has happened. With the\r\nhelp of foreign regular army units and mercenaries, the\r\nAbkhaz, who originally constituted only 17 per cent of\r\nthe population, expelled the majority just because they\r\nwere not Abkhaz, but Georgians, Armenians, Jews,\r\nRussians, Greeks or other ethnicities. This was\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\naccomplished alongside ethnically motivated summary\r\nexecutions and mass killings.\r\nThe involvement of international entities — the United\r\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE), the Russian Federation and the Group of\r\nFriends of the Secretary-General — has so far failed to\r\nproduce tangible results. In my opinion, one of the reasons\r\nfor the failure of all attempts to resolve this conflict is that\r\nwhat has really happened in Abkhazia has not yet been\r\nobjectively assessed at the level of the highest international\r\nbody — the Security Council, which the Charter mandates\r\nto act as the guarantor of security in the world. Is it not all\r\ntoo obvious that it is impossible to fight evil if one does not\r\ncall it by its proper name — that is, if one does not assign\r\nan appropriate legal assessment to what has happened?\r\nThe 21 United Nations resolutions on the conflict in\r\nAbkhazia, Georgia, do not provide such an unequivocal\r\nassessment, despite the fact that the final documents of the\r\nOSCE’s Budapest and Lisbon summits qualify the action of\r\nthe leaders of the Abkhaz separatists as ethnic cleansing.\r\nIndeed, the sole objective of the separatist leadership,\r\nencouraged by reactionary external forces, was to change\r\nthe demography of this autonomous republic. It is hard to\r\nimagine that a regime that has in fact attained its goal can\r\nbe convinced through mere request and persuasion to allow\r\nthe displaced to return.\r\nI do not want to be misunderstood. We do not thirst\r\nfor the blood of our Abkhaz brothers, nor do we seek\r\nvengeance. No, I am sure that in time Georgians and\r\nAbkhaz will dwell together in their historic homeland:\r\nGeorgia. But in order to speed up the process of the\r\nGeorgian-Abkhaz reconciliation, the tragedy must be given\r\nits fair legal assessment.\r\nIt is no surprise that in a century in which the concept\r\nof freedom has acquired such scope, human rights\r\ncommand special attention. Before Georgia was accepted\r\ninto the Council of Europe, rapporteurs scrutinized our\r\nhuman rights profile, examining how free the media were,\r\nthe conditions of prisoners — including the worst\r\noffenders — and many other aspects of human rights. We\r\nare grateful to the Council of Europe and other international\r\nbodies and non-governmental organizations for their\r\nundiminished attention to this critical aspect of life in our\r\ncountry, and for their unbiased assessments and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nEspecially against the backdrop of such keen attention\r\nto matters of human rights, I find it hard to understand the\r\nindifference of the international community to the fate of\r\nthe 300,000 people currently displaced from Abkhazia and\r\nto the flagrant violation of their basic right to live in their\r\nown homes. The matter is not whether or not help is\r\nbeing extended to these people. Of course, they would\r\nhave been in far more difficult straits had the United\r\nNations and individual countries not provided relief. But\r\nin terms of human rights the only response proportionate\r\nto their situation would be to assist them in restoring their\r\ninalienable rights — that is, allowing them to return to\r\ntheir homes and holding those who have violated their\r\nrights responsible, if only by giving an appropriate\r\nassessment of the acts of the perpetrators of ethnic\r\ncleansing. Unfortunately, little has been done to this end.\r\nAlthough expressing personal feelings is perhaps not\r\nappropriate from this podium, I find it difficult to repress\r\nmy emotions when talking of completely innocent people\r\nexpelled from their homes by brutal force fuelled by\r\nsimple hatred. My heart is heavy. I was involved in the\r\ncomplex processes that brought an end to the Cold War.\r\nI believed, as did my co-thinkers, that the future world\r\norder, liberated from the confrontations between camps,\r\nwould not permit injustice; that under the new conditions,\r\nthe United Nations and the Security Council, at the\r\npinnacle of our world’s hierarchy, would be able to\r\nprevent individual assaults against civilized norms of\r\nexistence.\r\nThe Assembly can imagine how disillusioned I was\r\nwhen ethnic purging of the Georgian population occurred,\r\nand, by the way, remaining unpunished within my own\r\ncountry. I addressed the Security Council twice with a\r\ndetailed account and explanation of what happened, but\r\nno substantial progress has yet been made, even in the\r\nformulation of its resolutions. Having experienced this\r\ndisappointment, I believe it should have come as no\r\nsurprise that I firmly supported the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) operation in Kosovo, aimed at\r\nputting an end to ethnic cleansing, since I viewed that\r\noperation as the long-awaited manifestation of a firm\r\nstand against evil. At the same time, however, the action\r\nin Kosovo must not be interpreted by anyone as even\r\nindirect support of aggressive separatism. By no means.\r\nI have always believed that aggressive separatism and\r\nattempts to manipulate evolving democratic orders by use\r\nof force is one of the worst and most dangerous maladies\r\nof modern times.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, during which the\r\nthreat of nuclear war hung over our heads like the sword\r\nof Damocles, while local conflicts, despite their true\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\ncauses, inevitably acquired an ideological tint, political\r\nanalysts have made extensive efforts to determine the\r\nnature of the virus causing today’s aggression and the\r\ncauses of possible future clashes. The theories are\r\nextremely interesting, and the debates as to how well they\r\ncorrespond to reality will doubtless continue for years to\r\ncome.\r\nOn the other hand, from even a brief glance at today’s\r\nconflicts it is clear that virtually all of them are linked to an\r\nerroneous interpretation by ethnic minorities of the principle\r\nof self-determination, and to a likewise erroneous\r\nunderstanding by titular nations and their central authorities\r\nof minorities’ rights with respect to that principle. In other\r\nwords, either aggressive separatism or no less aggressive\r\nviolation of the rights of ethnic minorities, and in some\r\ncases both, underlie these conflicts.\r\nDuring such confrontations, a certain segment of the\r\npopulation becomes undesirable to a group of political\r\nadventurists. This “foreign body” is then removed through\r\nthe policy of “ethnic cleansing” and genocide. Today there\r\nare hundreds of places in the world where some groups of\r\nindividuals may come to entertain an ambition towards this\r\nmanner of self- determination and apply the well tried —\r\nand, regrettably, in many cases successful — method,\r\nwhich I would call the method of demographic engineering.\r\nIt is not difficult to foresee how chaotic our world can\r\nbecome and what torment millions of innocent people will\r\nsuffer just because they are found to be ethnically\r\ninappropriate, so to speak.\r\nToday, when the epoch of colonial empires has been\r\nrelegated to the past, the issue of the integrity of the State\r\nand the self-determination of peoples demands new, clearer\r\nformulations to ensure that each side in a potential conflict\r\nfully realizes the limits of international legitimacy of its\r\nclaims. In democratic States, with Governments equally\r\nrepresenting the interests of all its citizens, self-\r\ndetermination must be regarded as the right to express\r\noneself in a very broad sense, but only within the\r\nboundaries of a State which, on its part, respects these\r\nrights. There should be no talk of separation by the use of\r\nforce and violation of territorial integrity.\r\nLet me also add that the rationale provided by\r\nopposing sides to justify forcible redrawing of borders\r\nalways centres around an alleged necessity to restore\r\nhistorical justice. History, which is hardly an exact science,\r\nis interpreted according to the respective interests of the\r\nsides involved. I believe that new thinking should have a\r\nsay with regard to this matter as well. In international\r\nrelations, perhaps, one must not overemphasize, or, to be\r\nmore precise, blow out of proportion the role of historical\r\nprecedence. That was precisely the intent of the Helsinki\r\nAccords, regarding norms for the inviolability of existing\r\nborders.\r\nAt the same time, there is nothing more fundamental\r\nto the formation of a national consciousness than the\r\ncitizens’ knowledge of their own history. And this\r\nacquires special significance in the present era of vigorous\r\nglobalization. The efforts of individual peoples,\r\nparticularly small ones, will not be enough to sustain\r\nworld diversity.\r\nThe contribution of each nation, large or small, to\r\nthe development of world civilization and culture is\r\nunique and special. So is that of my small country. The\r\nculture of every nationality is a singular phenomenon.\r\nAlthough the economy, the environment, the elimination\r\nof poverty, the management of demographic processes\r\nand sustainable development are the main challenges for\r\nus all, the time is also ripe to protect and preserve the\r\nnational cultural heritage, which remains an ever present\r\nfountain to enrich and ennoble the human spirit.\r\nThe Georgians say “Let us save culture, and culture\r\nwill save us”. Universal homogenization, which endangers\r\nthe identity of small nations, should be entered in the\r\nregister of modern threats. I suggest that we develop a\r\ncollective mechanism for their cultural protection.\r\nDevelopments in recent years have clearly shown\r\nthat the existing system of collective responsibility for\r\nglobal security is still far from perfect. Certainly, since\r\nbipolarity has been overcome we have significantly\r\nimproved the prospects for the successful activities of\r\ninternational organizations, especially the United Nations,\r\nwhose decisions were often not enforced because of the\r\nrivalry between the two ideological blocs. Yet they are\r\nnot always able to effectively address new perils. Order\r\ncannot be ensured unless negative sanctions are applied,\r\nand this is exactly what the United Nations is avoiding in\r\nevery way. Although the United Nations Charter does\r\nprovide for fairly strong mechanisms for ensuring\r\nsecurity, such awesome word combinations as Chapter\r\nVII and the Military Staff Committee exist most often\r\nmerely on paper. Surely the founders of the United\r\nNations deserve praise for their wisdom and vision, but\r\nwe should not forget that the mechanism they created for\r\nour collective responsibility for the world’s fate was\r\nframed for a different time.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nIt must be admitted that, despite attempts to establish\r\norder in the world, the planet continues to live in a state of\r\nanarchy. On the other hand, the need for a tougher and\r\nmore just order becomes increasingly more obvious. Most\r\nof today’s threats go way beyond the scope of the\r\ncompetence of the nation-State. They are global in nature.\r\nNo individual country can cope with them alone. Much as\r\nis the case within individual nations, the international\r\ncommunity primarily needs the unanimity of its subjects in\r\nterms of their commitment to a set of fundamental\r\nprinciples. This seems to be expressed in many charters and\r\nconventions. In reality, however, it is not the case. The\r\nattitude towards terrorism can be cited as an example.\r\nDespite public statements condemning terrorism, it appears\r\nthat many still allow it as an acceptable means for\r\nachieving political and other ends. How else can one\r\nexplain that terrorists whose identities are known to all are\r\nnot hiding in the woods, but, rather, are able to find shelter\r\nin different States?\r\nOf course, it is true that the world does respond to\r\nsome extent to threats as they occur. Individual States and\r\nalliances of States do make serious efforts to fight global\r\nailments. Sometimes, as has just happened in Kosovo, they\r\nundertake such tasks as a coercion to peace. It is my\r\nposition that no one has a moral right to denounce NATO\r\nfor that operation, particularly those who, through their\r\ninaction, play into the hands of those who disturb the peace.\r\nYet this is not precisely what one would call a\r\ndemonstration of collective responsibility. In such a case\r\nseveral democratic and developed — and therefore\r\npowerful — States undertake the stewardship of the rest of\r\nthe world. Of course, we can only thank them for this. But\r\nit would be better for all if those who have undertaken\r\nresponsibility for the fate of the world carried out their\r\nmission within the framework of a mechanism established\r\nby the international organizations. We have already\r\nproposed to expand the membership of the Security Council\r\nand address the issue of veto rights in order to adapt it to\r\npresent-day requirements. In my view, the almost automatic\r\nuse of the veto is unacceptable. In the bipolar world this\r\npractice largely cancelled out the possibility of conducting\r\npeace enforcement operations, because in those years any\r\nforce represented, to some extent, one pole or the other.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, the possibility of using\r\ncollective decisions to bring about peace reappeared. The\r\ndecision taken against the aggression in Kuwait gave many\r\nthe hope that from then on the Security Council would be\r\nbound by shared principles and that an ethical approach\r\nwould prevail. There were other encouraging episodes as\r\nwell. But in the case of Kosovo, a new cold breeze\r\nseemed to have begun to blow from the Security Council.\r\nDespite its humane motivations, the operation carried out\r\nby NATO — like any ethical action today — also\r\ncontained a pragmatic component. Had NATO not\r\nintervened in Kosovo, the influx of refugees would\r\ninevitably have upset the fragile balance in that extremely\r\nimportant part of Europe. Perhaps a number of States\r\nwould have been drawn into the conflict. We might even\r\nhave witnessed a big Balkan war.\r\nIn today’s world an ethical approach in international\r\npolitics is justified from a pragmatic standpoint as well.\r\nIt is from a position of morality that we should act if we\r\nwant to do good for mankind. Morality should be the\r\nbasis of our policy, and it should become the pillar of the\r\nnew thinking of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe are encouraged by the Secretary-General’s\r\nstatement that measures to reform the Security Council\r\nwill be taking place shortly and that the reform will\r\nenable us to act in accordance with the norms of\r\ninternational law when addressing regional conflicts in the\r\nfuture.\r\nRegardless of the serious threats existing today, it\r\nwould not be an overstatement to say that mankind has\r\nnever in the course of history had a more singular\r\nopportunity to create a just world order and a more\r\nharmonious community of nations. True, occasionally\r\nconfrontational rhetoric can still be heard, but I am\r\nconvinced that today’s controversies between East and\r\nWest are ghosts of the past, artificially grafted onto the\r\npresent. One may argue that this is done mostly to\r\ncamouflage the acute internal problems of individual\r\nStates. The generation that ended the cold war, the most\r\ndangerous conflict in the history of mankind, without\r\nspilling blood, can find a common language between\r\ncontinents, States and individual people and, through\r\ncivilized dialogue, shorten the route leading to the\r\nresolution of global problems today and in the future.\r\nNow that we have overcome the dividing lines of the\r\nideological confrontation, we must learn how to erase\r\nother lines that divide the peoples of our world into rich\r\nand poor, educated and uneducated. In this process too, a\r\nnew approach and new thinking are critical. Those who\r\nspoke before me have already mentioned that\r\nglobalization should not mean only access to markets,\r\nfree trade across borders, free movement of capital and\r\nfinancial interdependence. All this should be paralleled by\r\nthe globalization of responsibility for the fate of the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nplanet and the realization that today’s world is too small to\r\nallow for the painless coexistence of affluence and poverty.\r\nWe must find ways to alleviate the burden of debt on the\r\npoorest developing States. Otherwise, the perpetual pressure\r\nof a shortage in financial resources will render them unable\r\nto emerge from poverty and, certainly, unequipped to build\r\na free society.\r\nAssisting them in building free societies is a pragmatic\r\nobjective, not merely an ethical cause. In today’s\r\ninterdependent world the poverty of States will produce\r\nechoes of terrorism, drugs and crime in others. In order to\r\nbe secure, the future world must consist of at least\r\nmoderately well-off, free nations that will pursue\r\ntransparent and predictable domestic and foreign policies.\r\nI recall appeals made by the leaders of many developed\r\nStates at different international forums, including President\r\nClinton’s reassuring remarks at the annual meeting of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank,\r\nwhere he underlined the critical importance of relieving the\r\ndebt burden on poor nations.\r\nThere are also appeals to the effect that we should\r\nenter the twenty-first century with developing and\r\neconomically weak nations freed of the heavy burden of\r\ndebt. We could, in fact, think of a 10-year programme\r\ndesigned to resolve the problem of debts right at the outset\r\nof the twenty-first century. This would be a most fair\r\ndecision which, at the threshold of a new century and a\r\nnew millennium, would become a kind of beacon guiding\r\nmany a nation to a brighter future.\r\nI have said many times that I am generally optimistic\r\nabout the future of mankind. This optimism is grounded in\r\nthe belief that we are slowly acquiring experience; we can\r\nlearn and we can be transformed. The Marshall Plan and\r\npost-war Europe, which have vanquished the chimera of\r\nantagonisms and showed new ways of integration, are good\r\nexamples of this.\r\nIn 1985, when many from this platform spoke of “star\r\nwars” and the end of humanity, I declared that the new\r\nthinking offered to the world not “star wars”, but a “star\r\npeace”. I thank God that this declaration did not remain\r\nsimply a dream, and that mankind is gradually emerging\r\nfrom the nightmare of nuclear war, both on the ground and\r\nin the sky. This gives me reason to hope that humankind,\r\nequipped with the capacity for constant intellectual renewal,\r\nwill live its next century with a single mind which will\r\nmake it an epoch of peace and freedom, justice and\r\nuniversal harmony.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of Georgia for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Eduard Shevardnadze, President of Georgia,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Lionel Jospin, Prime Minister of\r\nthe French Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the French Republic.\r\nMr. Lionel Jospin, Prime Minister of the French\r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the French Republic, Mr. Lionel\r\nJospin, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Jospin (France) (spoke in French): I would like\r\nfirst of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly. It attests to the esteem in which the\r\ninternational community holds you and your country. I\r\nwould like to include in this tribute the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who bears the weighty responsibility of\r\npromoting the universality of the Organization and the\r\neffectiveness of its action. Lastly, I wish to congratulate\r\nthe three new Members of the United Nations. The great\r\nand fine ideal that the United Nations embodies is very\r\nmuch alive — of this I am firmly convinced.\r\nThe United Nations is undertaking a grand civilizing\r\nendeavour, a task that is constantly being challenged but\r\never necessary. To unite peoples to work together for\r\npeace and development, to affirm a body of legal rules\r\nframing relations among States and to achieve common\r\nstandards: that is the goal of the United Nations — a\r\ncivilizing goal.\r\nThat goal is achieved first of all through the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts. The role of the Security Council\r\nin this mission is more vital than ever, a pre-eminence it\r\nderives from the Charter. France will recall this\r\nfundamental rule as often as necessary. To be sure, there\r\nhave been circumstances when an urgent humanitarian\r\nsituation dictated we should act immediately, but such an\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\napproach must remain an exception. We must take care, as\r\nin the case of Kosovo, to reintegrate this action into the\r\ncontext of the Charter. Our fundamental rule is that it is for\r\nthe Security Council to resolve crisis situations. For that\r\nreason, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s new\r\nstrategic concept recalls that the Washington Treaty\r\nrecognizes the primary responsibility of the Security\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of peace.\r\nIndeed, the universal nature of the Organization is\r\nintangible. The United Nations must strive to respond to\r\ncrises, wherever they may occur. While we have not\r\nhesitated to do precisely that in recent years and on several\r\ncontinents, I would like to express regret at the relative\r\ntimidity of the Organization where Africa is concerned. The\r\nextent of the tragedies on that continent requires us to take\r\nmore resolute action.\r\nUniversality is compatible with complementarity in\r\naction. In the interests of efficiency, the United Nations\r\nmust encourage, in every part of the world, regional\r\narrangements among States capable of handling crises in\r\nthe first instance. Such is the spirit of Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter. Tasks should be realistically shared between the\r\nregional organizations and the Security Council without\r\nweakening the latter’s authority. For instance, my country\r\nhas, through the RECAMP programme, along with others,\r\nstrengthened African peacekeeping capabilities through\r\nassistance provided under United Nations auspices in\r\ncooperation with the Organization of African Unity.\r\nInternational security also demands continued\r\ndisarmament in the context of multilateral and verifiable\r\nagreements. This is an ongoing objective for France, which\r\nhopes that the work of the Conference on Disarmament will\r\nbe relaunched in the months prior to the Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. France would like to see\r\nthe prompt entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty, the start of negotiations on banning the\r\nproduction of fissile materials for nuclear-weapon use, and\r\nthe conclusion of a verification protocol to the Biological\r\nWeapons Convention. We would not support any\r\ndevelopment that might bring the Anti-Ballistic Missile\r\nTreaty into question and upset strategic balances.\r\nThe United Nations mission is not limited to the\r\nsettlement of conflicts between States. With humankind’s\r\ngrowing aspirations for greater freedom and responsibility,\r\nthis mission extends to the safeguarding of human dignity,\r\nwithin each State and, when necessary — as the Charter\r\nallows — against States. State-instigated violence has\r\nspawned serious humanitarian crises over the past few\r\nyears. Civilians have been targeted, whole populations\r\nhave been forcibly displaced, and refugee camps are not\r\nlonger secure. This is unacceptable. Consequently, we\r\nmust uphold the principle of international intervention,\r\nunder United Nations auspices, to assist the victims.\r\nEvery crisis recalls the need for the founding\r\nprinciple of working for peace and for respect for the law\r\nand the human person. A case in point is the conflict in\r\nKosovo. Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which\r\nlaid down the foundations of the settlement, illustrates\r\nthese principles and this resolve.\r\nWe have set ourselves ambitious objectives: ensuring\r\nsecurity for all, organizing reconstruction, ensuring\r\ncoexistence between communities, transferring authority\r\nto local leaders, and promoting democracy and pluralism.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s Special Representative and the\r\nKFOR Commander have done remarkable work. Much,\r\nhowever, remains to be done. The atrocities must be\r\nstopped, the exodus stemmed and housing built before\r\nwinter. On the political front, preparations must be made\r\nfor the future, which will require establishing dialogue\r\nbetween the communities. Elections will, I hope, be held\r\nin the year 2000. France has made resolute efforts in this\r\nrespect, alongside its partners in the European Union,\r\nwhich is providing half the international financing agreed\r\nupon by the conference of donors for Kosovo.\r\nIn East Timor, another people is asking that its\r\nrights be recognized. Overwhelmingly, it chose\r\nindependence through a referendum. Some have tried to\r\noppose that choice with violence. I therefore welcome the\r\nadoption, on 15 September, of Security Council resolution\r\n1264 (1999). It paves the way for the restoration of peace\r\nand should enable the democratic process to be\r\nsuccessfully concluded. France is participating in the\r\ninternational force established by decision of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nOur Organization therefore remains true to the\r\nvalues we celebrated last year, on its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nBut much effort is still needed for these values to be\r\nrespected everywhere. To achieve this, it is essential to\r\nstrengthen international criminal law. France actively\r\nsupports the work of the international criminal tribunals\r\nof The Hague and Arusha. The establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court will be a new and decisive\r\nstep in the progress of law. France hopes that it will be\r\nset up quickly; to that end, it has already amended its\r\nown Constitution.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nTo carry out its mission, the United Nations needs\r\nassured means. In order to deal with financial difficulties\r\nand prevent these from becoming a pretext for inaction, all\r\nMember States must meet their financial obligations\r\nvis-à-vis the Organization. France does so completely and\r\nunreservedly. A responsible attitude on the part of\r\ncontributing States would advance the necessary reform of\r\nthe Organization, including that of its Security Council.\r\nI should like to share with the Assembly my second\r\nfirm conviction: that the United Nations is admirably suited\r\nto meeting the challenges of our new world. Indeed, its\r\nmission is strengthened by globalization.\r\nInitially, the idea of organizing relations between\r\nStates at the world level may have seemed utopian to some.\r\nIt was merely before its time. Indeed, I consider the United\r\nNations to be modern for the following reasons. Our global\r\nand unstable world needs organization and the goal of the\r\nUnited Nations has always been to seek a better\r\norganization of the world. The United Nations is in step\r\nwith a networked world. It is itself a network, a rich and\r\nunique panoply of specialized but independent and\r\ncoordinated agencies. In half a century, the United Nations\r\nhas made a tool for action which can be adapted to our\r\nworld. The United Nations has not aged; it has grown with\r\nthe world. It must allow us to face the new challenges\r\nemerging in today’s world.\r\nA contradictory state of affairs has replaced the\r\neuphoric illusion which followed the end of the\r\nconfrontation between blocs 10 years ago. Globalization is\r\nnot monolithic. While it is unifying, it also divides. While\r\nit generates remarkable progress, it also leads to\r\nunacceptable inequalities. While it opens societies to one\r\nanother, it carries with it the threat of creating uniformity.\r\nWhile it frees up energy, it also releases negative forces\r\nthat must be brought under control. The movement of\r\npopulations and the clash of cultures are therefore\r\naccompanied by rising fears as to identity, by religious\r\nintolerance and by xenophobia. France, which has a\r\npresence on five continents and is itself a land of\r\nimmigration, has had experience of such confrontations in\r\nits history. It knows the risks they entail and the wealth\r\nthey bring. We will give our full support to the world\r\nconference on racism, to be held in 2001. Preventing the\r\nemergence of prejudice, which too often has deadly\r\nconsequences, will prepare the way for peace for future\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe fruits of globalization are not shared equally. The\r\nopening of economies, the increase in trade and the\r\nacceleration of technological progress all fuel growth. But\r\ninequalities are growing between countries and within\r\neach economy. Nearly one in four human beings lives in\r\ngreat poverty. We cannot leave matters as they stand. The\r\nrapid expansion of communications networks does not\r\nbenefit everyone. Yet the multiplication of sources of\r\ninformation, the increased circulation of ideas and the\r\nprofusion of new inventions are full of promise. Lower\r\ncommunications costs made possible by the Internet can\r\nbe an asset for businesses in countries in the South. But\r\ninequalities in education hinder access to these\r\ntechnologies. These impressive instruments for furthering\r\nknowledge may become formidable factors in inequality.\r\nCommunication is also a right. It is essential that this\r\nright not be threatened by the concentration in just a few\r\nhands of sources of information and the means of\r\nproduction and distribution. France will staunchly defend\r\ncultural diversity.\r\nGlobalization must encourage all of us to take\r\naccount of the fragility of our world — our Earth and our\r\ncommonweal. Our environment is not a product, a simple\r\nstock of raw materials on which we can draw without\r\ngiving thought to future generations. True development is\r\nsustainable development. Since the Rio Summit in 1992\r\nthis realization has been behind the adoption of important\r\ncommitments with regard to the climate, biodiversity and\r\ndesertification. The Kyoto Protocol on climate change and\r\nthe current negotiations on a protocol on biosafety attest\r\nto the importance of the achievements. But the uncertain\r\nfuture of climates and the recurrence of natural\r\ncatastrophes urge us to make further efforts.\r\nThe Earth is fragile, but so, too, is the human\r\nspecies. The spread of new epidemics endangers the\r\nhealth of entire populations. Inequalities in development\r\nexacerbate those scourges. Some 40 million people live\r\nwith the AIDS virus today, the majority of them in\r\ndeveloping countries. The spread of the pandemic in\r\nAfrica is a matter of major concern for us. I shall come\r\nback to that issue.\r\nGlobalization is changing the nature of organized\r\ncrime, an area in which there has been a real explosion.\r\nThe much greater fluidity in movement allows criminal\r\nnetworks to exploit the inconsistencies between one\r\nnational law and another and the weaknesses of some of\r\nthem so as to hide from justice. My country is ready to\r\nmake every effort to combat this scourge. The President\r\nof the French Republic made that clear last year at the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to that\r\nissue. The United Nations has long been engaged in the\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nfight against international drug-trafficking, building up\r\nexpertise, establishing specialized services and drafting a\r\nbody of doctrine and a legal framework. These must be\r\nstrengthened. But, above all, States must be more\r\ncommitted to action. In January negotiations began in\r\nVienna on a convention against transnational organized\r\ncrime. We must bring this to a satisfactory conclusion in\r\nthe year 2000.\r\nFaced with globalization, we have a choice to make.\r\nWe can either go along with the supposedly universal\r\neconomic laws, and in so doing abdicate our political\r\nresponsibilities, or we can seek to impose order on\r\nglobalization and thereby achieve control of our collective\r\nfuture. For my part, I believe that global problems call for\r\nglobal responses and that an unstable world needs to be\r\nregulated, requiring what our Anglo-Saxon friends might\r\ncall “rules and regulations”. This world needs rules. It\r\nneeds the United Nations.\r\nThis choice is also a matter of sovereignty. As the\r\nSecretary-General pointed out on 8 December last year in\r\nParis, the first words of our Charter, “We the Peoples of\r\nthe United Nations”, make it an expression of popular\r\nsovereignty. But in order for the sovereignty of peoples to\r\nbe affirmed they must find the means to acquire the\r\nmechanisms, the means of control and the benefits of\r\nglobalization. That is my third conviction. The more the\r\nworld becomes globalized, the more it needs rules. Faced\r\nwith the temptation of unilateralism, it is more necessary\r\nthan ever to base our action on multilateral rules respected\r\nby all. First of all, these concern the economy. We must\r\ndefine the rules of the game so that everyone can benefit\r\nfrom globalization. We must define the rules of the game\r\nbetween the industrial and developing countries and\r\nbetween the major economic actors, small and medium-\r\nsized business and the citizens of our countries who work\r\nand produce.\r\nIn the financial sphere, we have to strengthen the\r\nstability of the monetary and financial system by ensuring\r\nthe political legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF), involving the developing countries more closely in\r\nthe adoption of common rules and making private financial\r\noperators liable for the consequences of their decisions for\r\ncountries in crisis. Real progress has been made since the\r\ncrises of 1997 and 1998. France contributed to this by its\r\nproposals, especially in regard to hedge funds and fiscal\r\nhavens. It will continue to work to this end, as much\r\nremains to be done.\r\nThese rules of the game have to be based on better\r\ncoordination among international institutions. Since 1945,\r\ninternational cooperation has respected the principle of\r\nspecialization of institutions. In the future, the task is to\r\nmake them more complementary. Economic and trade\r\nrules cannot disregard the most elementary social and\r\nenvironmental norms. Accordingly, France supported the\r\nadoption by the International Labour Conference a year\r\nago of a declaration on the fundamental principles and\r\nrights involved in labour. The International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO) is an irreplaceable forum for dialogue\r\nbetween government and social partners and for the\r\nformulation of minimal standards. It is desirable that it\r\nestablish close relations with other organizations, such as\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World\r\nBank.\r\nFor these rules of the game to be better respected,\r\nappropriate cooperation has to be established with the\r\npoorest countries. Their debt burden continues to be the\r\nprimary obstacle to development. At their meeting in\r\nCologne, the G-7 countries pledged to grant further debt\r\nrelief. France contributed to this. Three principles will be\r\napplied: solidarity, which calls for us to grant the poorest\r\ncountries the most favourable debt treatment; fairness,\r\nwhich requires the rich countries to share the financial\r\neffort in a balanced way; and responsibility, whereby the\r\ncountries benefiting from this aid undertake policies\r\ndirected towards sustainable development and the fight\r\nagainst poverty. For these countries, official development\r\nassistance remains indispensable. France will continue to\r\nadvocate greater effort on the part of the richest countries.\r\nOur action should be increasingly inspired by the\r\naffirmation of common values and rules. Human rights\r\nare central to this approach. I am referring in particular to\r\nthe weakest children. The ILO Convention which outlaws\r\nthe worst forms of child labour is a new case in point.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild must be supplemented as soon as possible by the\r\ntwo protocols now being negotiated, one against the\r\nrecruitment of children in armed conflicts, the other\r\nagainst the sale of children and child prostitution and\r\npornography.\r\nTo affirm the rights of women is to recognize their\r\ndecisive role in education, in the production of wealth and\r\nin development. But it is also to combat the\r\ndiscrimination and violence which they suffer. France has\r\nmade equality between women and men one of the\r\ncornerstones in the renewal of its public life. The\r\nadditional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nof All Forms Discrimination against Women, submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly for approval, offers women the\r\npossibility to assert their rights in an individual capacity.\r\nThat is a major step forward. The special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in June 2000 will highlight the progress\r\nthat has been achieved since the 1995 Conference in\r\nBeijing.\r\nReaffirming the right of all human beings to health\r\nmeans combating pandemics everywhere. In December\r\n1997, in Abidjan, France proposed the establishment of a\r\n“therapeutic solidarity fund” to mobilize the international\r\ncommunity to care for and treat AIDS sufferers. The\r\ncountries of the South and associations involved in\r\ncombating the disease welcomed the proposal warmly. But\r\nthe impact of AIDS on development remains dramatic. We\r\nmust intensify our efforts to reduce this plague. Only the\r\nUnited Nations can give these efforts the necessary breadth.\r\nThe principle of precaution has to be the basis for our\r\naction regarding the environment and health safety. The\r\nMontreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer,\r\nbased on the principle of differentiated commitments\r\nbetween the North and South, is an example of well-\r\nconceived international action. These efforts must be\r\ncontinued. We will do so by advocating, with our European\r\nUnion partners, a world convention on forests and by\r\nredoubling efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the\r\natmosphere. Precaution must also be the guiding principle\r\nin monitoring food safety. The combination of concern for\r\nsustainable agriculture, the quality of products and the\r\npreservation of food traditions in each country explain the\r\nintensity of recent reactions. France therefore intends to see\r\nthese demands taken into account at the forthcoming WTO\r\nnegotiations.\r\nIn order to address and overcome the world’s\r\nproblems, to derive the best from globalization, we need\r\nnations to be aware of their responsibilities, and we need\r\nalso to have “more” of the United Nations. Through an\r\nOrganization strengthened by a renewed sense of mission,\r\nsupported by sovereign States and regional organizations,\r\nwe will be able to further respect for human rights, promote\r\ndemocracy, work for sustainable development and help all\r\nto achieve their potential.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of France for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Lionel Jospin, Prime Minister of France, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nMr. El-Khatib (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Permit\r\nme first to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\noffice of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfourth session. I am fully confident that your experience\r\nand skills will bring the work of this session to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. Please permit me also to express\r\nmy deep appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, for his magnificent and distinguished\r\nstewardship, which made a success of the last session.\r\nI take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his wise\r\nleadership and outstanding work towards realizing and\r\nemphasizing the goals and principles of the United\r\nNations and his tireless efforts to achieve peace, security\r\nand stability in the world.\r\nIn the last few months of the second millennium,\r\nand as we bid farewell to it and await the dawning of the\r\nthird millennium, this session of the General Assembly\r\ntakes place at an important historic and symbolic moment,\r\na moment of mixed emotions. We look back and see that\r\nmankind has achieved great things despite the serious\r\nsuffering and pain that have marked the twentieth century.\r\nWe look forward with great hope to entering a new era in\r\nwhich we shall build a more humanitarian world, in\r\nwhich nations will be able to live in true partnership, with\r\na sense of belonging to this planet, in a more just and\r\nharmonious way. We shall have an enhanced ability to\r\ncope collectively with the major challenges that confront\r\nus and to respond to changes that require a long-range\r\nglobal vision. This will increase our ability to provide\r\nanswers and solutions to the difficult questions and issues\r\nthat face us.\r\nThis historic moment is of particular importance in\r\nthe life of Jordan, which was engulfed by grief a few\r\nmonths ago, when it was deprived of its great leader, the\r\nlate King Hussein Ibn Talal — may God bless his soul.\r\nHe had succeeded in turning Jordan from a small country\r\nwith limited resources into an oasis of peace and stability\r\nin a region beset by disturbances and wars. This country\r\nhas just begun a new era under the leadership of King\r\nAbdullah II Bin Al Hussein. His Majesty has assumed the\r\nresponsibility for continuing, with renewed vigour, to lead\r\nJordan to progress and prosperity, as we look forward to\r\nushering in the new century. He is committed also to\r\nJordan’s continuing to make its important and essential\r\ncontribution to the building of peace in the Middle East\r\nand to continuing to contribute generously at the\r\ninternational level. He strongly believes, as Jordan’s\r\nleaders have always believed, that our country belongs to\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nthis international family. Jordan is committed to the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and to the principles of international\r\nlaw.\r\nOur late leader was a unique international leader, with\r\nan unflinching belief in the role of the United Nations and\r\nin the peaceful settlement of disputes. He expressed his\r\nbelief in these principles by working all his life to bring\r\nabout a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast based on international legitimacy. He did this out of\r\nhis strong belief in human dignity, in people’s right to live\r\nfree from all forms of injustice and despotism, and out of\r\nan awareness that human life is too precious to be wasted\r\nin confrontations and wars. Human beings have the right to\r\nlead free and dignified lives, channelling all their resources\r\nand energies towards achieving economic and social\r\ndevelopment and participating in building a prosperous and\r\nsecure future for the generations to come.\r\nThe life of our great leader who is, alas, no more, is\r\nthe story of the building of modern Jordan. His exceptional\r\ncontributions in the international arena were also a rare\r\nexample of what can be achieved by a historic leader who\r\nbelieves in high moral principles and supreme virtues.\r\nJordanians felt a deep sense of pride and appreciation when\r\nthey saw the whole world — leaders and common people\r\nalike — standing side by side with them, sharing their grief\r\nat the loss of the creator of their renaissance and their\r\nmodern State. They also felt a deep sense of trust and\r\nconfidence in the strength and durability of their\r\nconstitutional and institutional structures, which were built\r\nby the late leader of their country and have ensured a stable\r\nand successful beginning to the era of King Abdullah II Bin\r\nAl Hussein, in a way that has won the appreciation and\r\nrespect of the world.\r\nJordanians are rallying today behind their King and\r\nmarching behind him on the road to realizing their hopes\r\nand aspirations. Jordan is beginning, under the leadership of\r\nKing Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, a new era with a firm\r\ncommitment to following the same course that has\r\ndistinguished and will continue to distinguish Jordanian\r\npolicy at both the domestic and international levels.\r\nOver the past few months, Jordan has continued its\r\nefforts to advance the peace process in the Middle East.\r\nThis process had suffered over the past three years from\r\nfoot-dragging leading to effective deadlock, all of which\r\nseverely tested the confidence of the peoples of the region\r\nin the peace process as a whole. The result of last May’s\r\nparliamentary elections in Israel gave rise to new hopes of\r\nreviving this process and putting it back on track. The\r\npositive developments of the past few weeks show that\r\nthe region stands now before a second historic\r\nopportunity to achieve peace on all tracks. We sincerely\r\nhope that the leaders of the region will seize this\r\nopportunity, live up to the expectations and aspirations of\r\ntheir peoples and not hesitate to take the bold decisions\r\nneeded to bring the negotiations to fruition.\r\nThe question of Palestine has been and will continue\r\nto be at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the\r\nMiddle East crisis. The establishment of peace in the\r\nregion therefore requires, first and foremost, that a just\r\nsolution should be reached to this question — a solution\r\nwith which the peoples of the region will be satisfied and\r\nwhich they will if need be defend. Jordan has been calling\r\nthroughout the past year for the Wye River Memorandum,\r\nwhich was arrived at with the unprecedented involvement\r\nand assistance of the late King Hussein, to be\r\nimplemented. We have been consistently aware of the\r\nimpact that implementation of the Memorandum would\r\nhave on reactivating the peace process on all tracks, on\r\nestablishing confidence and a spirit of partnership\r\nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships, and on re-\r\nestablishing confidence in the peace process amongst the\r\npeoples of the region. The signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nMemorandum has enhanced the prospects for\r\nimplementing the Wye River Memorandum in a way that\r\nwe hope will advance the final status negotiations\r\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis so that a\r\nsettlement may be reached that would ensure that the\r\nPalestinian people realize their right to self-determination,\r\nincluding their right to establish an independent State on\r\ntheir national territory, with Al-Quds al-Sharif — Holy\r\nJerusalem — as its capital.\r\nAs King Abdullah II has emphasized, Jordan will\r\ncontinue to provide support for a successful conclusion of\r\nthe negotiations. We are directly interested in their\r\nsuccess because the issues on the agenda relate to our\r\nnational interest, particularly the issues of the refugees,\r\nthe borders and Jerusalem. Over the past 50 years, Jordan,\r\nmore than any other party, has shouldered the burden of\r\nthe refugee problem. This has put immense pressures on\r\nJordan’s resources and economy, particularly given that\r\nevery reduction in the services provided by the United\r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\r\nin the Near East (UNRWA) has placed additional burdens\r\non Jordan. Direct expenditures by the Government of\r\nJordan on services provided to the refugees in 1998\r\nreached 4.75 times the amount spent by UNRWA on such\r\nservices. Total expenditures incurred by the Government\r\nof Jordan equal the entire budget that UNRWA spends on\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nrefugees in all its areas of operations throughout the Middle\r\nEast. Jordan calls on the international community not to\r\nallow any reductions in the role of UNRWA or in its\r\nprogrammes until the refugee question has been resolved in\r\naccordance with international legitimacy — which would\r\nlead to the closing of this file in its entirety once and for\r\nall. Jordan also calls on the donor countries to continue\r\ntheir support for UNRWA to enable it to continue to\r\ndischarge its responsibilities.\r\nWith regard to the peace process on other tracks,\r\nJordan believes that a comprehensive solution is a\r\nprerequisite for the establishment of peace in the region.\r\nWithout such a solution, no settlement can be assured of\r\ndurability. Jordan therefore strongly supports the efforts to\r\nreactivate negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.\r\nIt supports the demand by Syria and Lebanon that\r\nnegotiations should be resumed from the point at which\r\nthey stopped. The Jordanian leadership will spare no effort\r\nto help bring about a breakthrough in negotiations on both\r\ntracks.\r\nHopes have been rising over the past few weeks that\r\nthis can be achieved, particularly in view of Syria’s\r\nreaffirmation of its full commitment to work for the\r\nestablishment of peace and of its concern for reviving the\r\npeace process and bringing it to its desired goal: the\r\nachievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive\r\nsettlement. There have also been a number of positive\r\nindicators from the Syrian Government and the Israeli\r\nGovernment has said that it is convinced of the crucial\r\nimportance of reaching a peace agreement with Syria.\r\nWhile looking forward to these positive developments with\r\ngreat hopes, the peoples of the region earnestly desire that\r\nthis historic opportunity should not be missed and that the\r\nefforts made will succeed in reaching a settlement whereby\r\nSyria and Lebanon will have their legitimate rights restored\r\nthrough Israel’s withdrawal from the Syrian Arab Golan\r\nHeights and from southern Lebanon in implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\r\n425 (1978).\r\nThe peoples of the Middle East region have suffered\r\nunprecedented hardships because of the failure to reach a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peaceful settlement. Vast\r\nresources have been squandered on a useless arms race that\r\nfailed to provide security for any of the parties. Today the\r\npeoples of the region look forward to real progress in the\r\npeace process — progress that will help create a climate\r\nconducive to an end to the arms race and to convincing the\r\nvarious parties that peace is the only option capable of\r\nproviding security for all. It will also convince them to\r\nmake the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. This requires a commitment from all parties\r\nto accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and to ratify the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nThe issues of refugees, economic disparities and\r\nwater, as well as the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, require effective regional cooperation and\r\nconcrete international support. Without resolving the\r\nfundamental political aspects of the conflict, the region\r\nwill continue to suffer from the consequences of non-\r\ncooperation in resolving these issues. Unless they are\r\nresolved, they themselves will escalate and create new\r\nhotbeds of conflict in the region.\r\nOn the eastern flank of our region, the Iraqi people\r\ncontinue to suffer unprecedented hardships as a result of\r\nthe continued economic sanctions. The price of these\r\nsanctions is paid by the Iraqi people in terms of their\r\nhealth, nutrition, education and prospects for progress.\r\nThis poses serious future dangers for the region as a\r\nwhole.\r\nJordan therefore calls for ending this suffering by\r\nlifting the sanctions. It also calls for the implementation\r\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions, including\r\nthose concerning the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and\r\nmissing persons. It further calls upon the Security Council\r\nto conduct a comprehensive review that would lead to\r\nextricating Iraq from this situation and to affirm its\r\nposition of upholding the territorial integrity of Iraq as\r\none of the main pillars of regional security.\r\nJordan’s geographical location between two\r\nextremely complex situations resulting from the\r\nconsequences of the Middle East crisis in general and the\r\nlack of progress in the peace process during the past three\r\nyears in particular, as well as the continued economic\r\nsanctions against Iraq for nine years, has subjected the\r\nJordanian economy to tremendous pressures. Countries\r\nwith capabilities and resources much greater than Jordan’s\r\nwould have difficulty coping with them. Although Jordan\r\nis committed to implementing an integrated programme of\r\nreform and restructuring of its economy and to taking\r\ndifficult and painful economic measures, the impact of\r\nthese two situations makes it virtually impossible for\r\nJordan to achieve acceptable levels of economic growth,\r\nand it continues to suffer a huge external debt.\r\nViewing the real economic situation of Jordan and\r\nthe challenges facing it without linking it to the regional\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nenvironment that affects it does not give a true picture of\r\nthis situation. While Jordan is grateful for and appreciative\r\nof the international community’s support for Jordan’s\r\nefforts to cope with its enormous economic challenges, and\r\nits assistance to Jordan in playing its central role in\r\nmaintaining stability in the region, Jordan would like the\r\ninternational community to have a better understanding of\r\nits economic problems. From this perspective, we view with\r\nspecial appreciation the final communiqué issued at the\r\nSummit meeting of the leaders of the industrialized nations\r\nin Cologne last June, which reflected political will to help\r\nJordan and called for the consideration of reducing Jordan’s\r\nforeign debt-burden. We hope that the friendly creditor\r\ncountries will take all possible measures to translate that\r\npolitical will into action, enabling Jordan to reduce its debt\r\nburden to a point that allows its economy to be revitalized\r\nand to achieve higher growth rates.\r\nThe tragic situation the people of Kosovo were made\r\nto experience severely tested the ability of the international\r\ncommunity, at the close of this century, to prevent the\r\ncrimes of ethnic cleansing and the violation of basic human\r\nrights from being committed in a most despicable, racist\r\nmanner. This matter raises extremely serious and complex\r\nquestions about the role of the United Nations and the\r\nlimits that separate the right of States to assert their\r\nsovereignty without committing mass crimes against\r\nhelpless unarmed civilians.\r\nThere are lessons to be drawn from this bitter human\r\nexperience. On the one hand, the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization’s ability to put an end to the criminal acts has\r\ngiven clear evidence to all those who harbour thoughts of\r\nrebelling against international law and of committing\r\nsimilar acts that they should not presume that their\r\ndomestic military strength ensures absolute dominance,\r\nincluding violation of human rights. Upholding the principle\r\nof sovereignty should not overturn the obligation to observe\r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law.\r\nOn the other hand, as Members of this international\r\nOrganization, we must look into finding mechanisms that\r\nensure the enhancement of the United Nations and its\r\nability to be the framework that expresses the determination\r\nof the international community to prevent such crimes, and\r\nto be the umbrella for the coordination and organization of\r\ncollective international action to achieve that goal.\r\nThat situation has demonstrated the need for\r\nformulating a new international order for the twenty-first\r\ncentury, in which all peoples can enjoy respect for their\r\ndiversity and can participate in the formation of a world\r\nconscience that ensures their coexistence. Continued\r\nprogress by peoples in adopting democracy as a way of\r\nlife makes it urgent to strengthen democracy within the\r\ninternational system. Since the United Nations is the\r\nbackbone of the world system, it must evolve in such a\r\nway that reflects the new realities in the international\r\narena.\r\nOur international community has an urgent need to\r\npause for a real review of the international situation in all\r\nits dimensions: political, security, economic,\r\nenvironmental and human rights. We hope that the world\r\nsummit to be held next year will provide an opportunity\r\nfor such a review.\r\nWhile we see that many issues and crises considered\r\nby the United Nations remain to be resolved, this does not\r\nnecessarily mean failure on the part of the United Nations\r\nas much as it demonstrates the importance of an existing\r\npolitical will to resolve them.\r\nFurthermore, the challenges of globalization pose\r\nnew kinds of global problems, which require harmonious\r\nglobal solutions to the challenges facing developed\r\nsocieties, such as terrorism, drug-trafficking and pollution\r\nof the environment, and to the challenges that threaten the\r\ndeveloping countries, such as debt, unemployment and\r\neconomic recession. Such solutions must also strengthen\r\nthe ability of the developing countries to benefit from the\r\nopportunities provided by globalization and to avoid its\r\nnegative effects by preventing a broadening of the\r\ninequalities that lie between them and the developed\r\ncountries. The persistence of these inequalities will cause\r\nthe developing countries to remain on the periphery of\r\nglobalization.\r\nDespite the magnitude of the challenges that\r\ncontinue to confront us as we begin the proceedings of\r\nthis last session of the General Assembly in this century,\r\nwe should not overlook the many positive steps that have\r\nbeen made recently. The adoption of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court was a particularly important\r\nmeasure taken towards confronting and preventing the\r\nperpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity\r\nfrom escaping punishment. I must also mention the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the first Conference of States\r\nParties on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and On\r\nTheir Destruction.\r\nSuch accomplishments contribute to strengthening\r\nhuman security and consolidating the commitment to\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nhuman rights. They also provide examples of the potential\r\nfor activating international cooperation in many areas,\r\nincluding the promotion of international commitment to\r\ncondemning and prohibiting terrorism.\r\nIn a different context, Jordan welcomes the agreement\r\nreached by Libya and the United Nations on the Lockerbie\r\nissue. It also commends the strenuous efforts made by the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, which contributed\r\nto the reaching of an agreement. It calls for the complete\r\nlifting of sanctions against Libya, after the removal of the\r\nreasons for such sanctions and following the extradition of\r\nthe two suspects for trial.\r\nOn the matter of regional crises, we appeal to our\r\nfriends in Pakistan and India to resort to peaceful means to\r\nresolve their conflict and to refrain from any escalation that\r\nwould seriously endanger the peace of the Indian\r\nsubcontinent and the whole world.\r\nAs for the dispute between the United Arab Emirates\r\nand the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan calls for, as it\r\nalways has, the resolution of this dispute through dialogue\r\nbased upon mutual respect. It also hopes that Iran will heed\r\nthe United Arab Emirates’ request to enter into dialogue\r\nwith a specific timetable and agenda, in order to reach a\r\nsolution that conforms to international legitimacy, which\r\ndenies the admissibility of occupation of territory by force.\r\nJordan attaches special importance to maintaining a\r\ndialogue between religions and civilizations, in order to\r\nbring closer together the views of the various beliefs,\r\nreligions and civilizations. This will also create a common\r\nbase for developing humanitarian thought, which calls for\r\npeace and cooperation rather than confrontation. These\r\nefforts have resulted in creating a greater awareness at the\r\ndomestic and international levels of the goals of this\r\ndialogue. We hope that the United Nations will promote,\r\nthrough its specialized agencies, programmes of dialogue in\r\nthe various fields of human activity and at all national,\r\nregional and international levels.\r\nThe international community is called upon to use\r\ndialogue to combat dangerous discriminatory practices,\r\nwhich we see today, such as Islamophobia. Islam is being\r\nsubjected to a severe and unjustified attack, which attempts,\r\nintentionally or unintentionally, to establish a linkage\r\nbetween Islam and those extremist and terrorist movements\r\nthat hurt Islam and Muslims by using religion as a tool.\r\nDiscrimination and arbitrary practices against Muslim\r\npopulations in various countries are only a result of\r\nextremist thinking, far removed from the principles of\r\ncivilized behaviour and humanity. The international\r\ncommunity must consider how to confront this\r\nphenomenon of Islamophobia in order to prevent its\r\nproliferation.\r\nNatural disasters, which have afflicted many\r\ncountries recently, remind us of a basic fact, which is that\r\nwe all face phenomena and challenges that do not\r\ndiscriminate between us on the basis of race, religion,\r\nwealth or geographical location. While expressing\r\nsympathy to our friends in Turkey and Greece, which\r\nhave been hit by earthquakes recently, and our admiration\r\nfor the positive sentiments they have expressed to each\r\nother in their suffering, we realize that confronting natural\r\ndangers and disasters, like confronting other challenges,\r\nrequires a sincere political will to take collective action in\r\norder to preserve the planet, to which we all belong\r\nequally.\r\nAgenda item 8\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work\r\nLetters from the Chairman of the Committee on\r\nConferences (A/54/313/Add.1 and 2)\r\nThe President: I should like to draw attention to the\r\ntwo letters dated 15 September 1999 from the Chairman\r\nof the Committee on Conferences addressed to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, contained in\r\ndocument A/54/313/Add.1 and 2. As members are aware,\r\nthe Assembly, in paragraph 7 of resolution 40/243,\r\ndecided that no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly\r\nshould be permitted to meet at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters during a regular session of the General\r\nAssembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.\r\nAs indicated in document A/54/313/Add.1, the\r\nCommittee on Conferences has recommended that the\r\nGeneral Assembly authorize the Preparatory Committee\r\nfor the special session of the General Assembly on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development and further initiatives to meet in New\r\nYork during the main part of the fifty-fourth session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts this\r\nrecommendation of the Committee on Conferences?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 20 September 1999\r\nThe President: As indicated in document\r\nA/54/313/Add.2, the Committee on Conferences has\r\nrecommended that the General Assembly authorize the\r\nCommittee on Information to meet in New York during\r\nthe main part of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts this\r\nrecommendation of the Committee on Conferences?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAnnouncement\r\nThe President: As members can see, this meeting\r\nhas gone quite a bit past 1 p.m. in order to accommodate\r\nall the speakers on the list for this meeting. In this\r\nconnection, I should like to again remind members that\r\nthe General Assembly, in paragraph 21 of the annex to\r\nresolution 51/241, indicated a voluntary guideline of up to\r\n20 minutes for each statement in the general debate.\r\nI would appeal to speakers in future meetings to\r\nmake an effort to observe this voluntary 20-minute\r\nguideline for the general debate.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.05 p.m.\r\n35\r\n"
