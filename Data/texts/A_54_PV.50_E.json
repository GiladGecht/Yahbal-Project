(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 33\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/259)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.11)\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Ricardo Alarcón de\r\nQuesada, President of the National Assembly of People\u0027s\r\nPower of Cuba, to introduce draft resolution A/54/L.11.\r\nMr. Alarcón de Quesada (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nIn seven consecutive years the General Assembly has\r\nadopted by a large majority seven resolutions similar to the\r\none I now have the honour to introduce, clearly establishing\r\nthe need to put an end to the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial blockade imposed by the United States against\r\nCuba. They have all been ignored. Instead of complying\r\nwith them, in that same period Washington has enacted two\r\nlaws, numerous amendments and executive and legislative\r\nprovisions extending and intensifying a policy that has been\r\nrejected by the international community.\r\nOn 13 April this year, a Cuban-European corporation\r\nwas arbitrarily deprived of its rights by a United States\r\ncourt that was forced to take such action by an amendment\r\nsurreptitiously appended to the 1999 appropriations bill.\r\nInternational agreements on trademarks and patents have\r\nthus become the most recent victims of a policy that is as\r\ninsolent as it is irresponsible.\r\nNor has Washington respected its own commitments.\r\nIt promised to partially modify some secondary aspects of\r\nthe most offensive of its laws — at least those having to\r\ndo with the denial of visas to foreign business executives\r\ninvesting in Cuba — but it has done absolutely nothing in\r\nthis regard. On the contrary, not long before this meeting,\r\nit published threats against several companies from\r\nEurope and other countries. These actions directly and\r\nexplicitly contradict the widely publicized agreement with\r\nthe European Union and also constitute an escalation in\r\nthe application of the so-called Helms-Burton Act\r\nbecause, in this case, Washington is acting on behalf of\r\npersons who were not American citizens when their\r\nproperties were nationalized.\r\nThe resolutions have been ignored and\r\nunderstandings have been violated. At the same time, that\r\ncountry is carrying out a dishonest campaign aimed at\r\ncreating confusion and at perpetuating its unacceptable\r\nconduct, which goes against the legal and ethical\r\nobligations that all States must respect. Pressure and\r\nmanoeuvres intended to thwart the actions of the\r\nAssembly have multiplied this year.\r\nLetters have been sent from Washington and other\r\nmoves have been made urging Member States to vote\r\nagainst the draft resolution introduced by Cuba. I am not\r\nrevealing any secrets. I am sure the Assembly is familiar\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nwith the text of those communications signed by senior\r\nState Department officials. I have three of them here with\r\nme. These letters are examples of arrogance and a lack of\r\nrespect for the dignity of the Member States and the\r\nintelligence of their representatives. The Organization\u0027s\r\nlargest debtor — the country that is mainly responsible for\r\nthe Organization\u0027s financial crisis because it has not paid its\r\nmeagre assessment while it reaps the greatest benefits from\r\nthe income obtained from the United Nations and all its\r\nMembers by virtue of the privilege of being the host\r\ncountry — not only ignores the repeated decisions of the\r\nAssembly, but insults it with its presumptuousness and lies.\r\nHow can they say at this time that there is no\r\nblockade, that “the embargo is a bilateral issue” and that\r\n“its regulations apply only to persons or entities subject to\r\nUnited States jurisdiction”?\r\nWho do they think they are fooling? If this is so, why\r\nhave other countries that are trade partners of the United\r\nStates been forced to adopt specific regulations to protect\r\nthemselves from its extraterritorial intentions? Why has it\r\nbeen necessary to resort to the World Trade Organization?\r\nWhy has there been a majority vote in the Assembly every\r\nyear? Or are they perhaps trying to tell us that all persons\r\nand entities on the planet are subject to Washington\u0027s\r\njurisdiction?\r\nThis letter not only is an offence to the international\r\ncommunity, it also mocks the American people and their\r\nelected officials. It does so when it says without the least\r\nbit of shame that the Government of the United States is\r\n“facilitating greatly the export of U.S. medicines and\r\nmedical supplies to Cuba, and permitting food sales”.\r\nAfter thoroughly considering the matter, the American\r\nAssociation for World Health refuted this utterly cynical\r\nfalsehood by concluding that the “embargo\u0027s restrictions\r\nsignify the deliberate blockading of the Cuban population\u0027s\r\naccess to food and medicine”.\r\nIf there is a shred of truth in the State Department\u0027s\r\nfallacy, why do American farmers protest and demand\r\nspecifically to be allowed to sell their products to Cuba?\r\nWhy did 70 senators strive unsuccessfully to put an end to\r\nthis prohibition? Or is the United States Senate also\r\nunworthy of the respect of Washington bureaucrats?\r\nIn the letter they have circulated, they claim that the\r\npurpose of the blockade is “to restore freedom and\r\ndemocracy in Cuba”, and they attempt to slander our\r\ncountry by accusing it of alleged human rights violations.\r\nThis comes from a Government that with its economic\r\nwar denies all Cubans — including children, sick people,\r\nthe elderly and women — essential food and necessary\r\nmedicines to save lives or relieve pain; a Government that\r\nsupported Batista\u0027s dictatorship to the very end and that\r\ntrained, armed and advised the henchmen and torturers\r\nwho murdered 20,000 Cubans; a Government that attacks\r\nthe Cuban people because it has never forgiven them for\r\ndefeating tyranny and reaching full liberation through\r\ntheir heroic struggle.\r\nThe American document also omits some important\r\ndetails. It fails to mention that Washington shamelessly\r\ninterferes in Cuba\u0027s internal affairs and that it organizes,\r\npromotes and finances subversive actions intended to\r\nundermine Cuban society and overthrow its Government.\r\nAll of this it proclaims openly.\r\nFor example, a United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development (USAID) press release lists in\r\ndetail the funds spent on these activities during the first\r\neight months of 1999, which total $6,111,000. This\r\namount, which was budgeted under section 109 of the\r\nHelms-Burton Act, represents only a small percentage of\r\nthe resources that have been overtly used against Cuba.\r\nAnother $22 million was allocated this year for illegal\r\nradio and television broadcasts. This is federal budget\r\nmoney which is directly and openly supplied by\r\nGovernment agencies, to which we would have to add\r\nthose funds that are indirectly handed out through\r\nseemingly private agencies.\r\nWe can only imagine the amount of money, which\r\nis certainly considerable, that is secretly channelled\r\nthrough the Central Intelligence Agency, to which\r\nreference is made in section 115 of that same Act, or the\r\nfunds that are earmarked, under section 108, for secretly\r\ngathering information on the Cuban economy and the\r\nactivities of foreign companies there. These provisions\r\nserve as a basis for the punitive measures that\r\nWashington takes against the executives of those\r\ncompanies and their relatives, on which the\r\nAdministration regularly reports to Congress —\r\nconfidentially, of course.\r\nFreedom and democracy are not the exclusive\r\nproperty of the United States, and its Government has no\r\nreason to claim them as its own. No one has empowered\r\nit to decide what the political and social organization of\r\nother countries should be, and Cuba is not, and will never\r\nagain be, its colony. The economic warfare against Cuba\r\nbegan at precisely the moment when the Cubans\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\noverthrew the Batista dictatorship, which was a loyal ally\r\nand servile instrument of the United States. The real\r\npurpose of this policy is to wrest from us the freedom and\r\ndemocracy we struggled so long and hard to win. The real\r\ngoal of the blockade is to divest Cubans of their country,\r\nappropriate their lands, their homes, their schools and their\r\nhospitals, and subject them once again to United States\r\ndomination. These are the real purposes of the blockade, as\r\nthe infamous Helms-Burton Act states quite clearly.\r\nInevitably, this policy also has a negative effect on the\r\nsovereign rights of other countries, because from its first\r\nday and throughout its four decades, the blockade has\r\ncontinuously and systematically attacked the very\r\nfoundations of civilization through its most sacred principle:\r\nthe right to life of an entire nation.\r\nSince 1959, the objective of the United States has\r\nbeen, and still is, to destroy the Cuban people. This is\r\ngenocide, plain and simple. For four decades the blockade\r\nhas been deliberately sustained against the Republic of\r\nCuba and all of its people, bringing illness, death, pain and\r\nsuffering to millions of Cubans, the victims of a policy that\r\ncontinues to be in force. The guilty parties should be\r\npunished under the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide, which was adopted\r\non 9 December 1948. No matter how much they try to hide\r\nit, there is more than enough irrefutable evidence, and\r\nrecently declassified official documents offer additional\r\nproof.\r\nOn 1 January 1959, even before the revolutionary\r\ngovernment was in place, the first blow was dealt to the\r\nnational economy, when the persons who had plundered the\r\nTreasury escaped to the United States under the protection\r\nof that country. They took with them $424 million — the\r\ncountry\u0027s only reserves. This money has never been\r\nreturned to Cuba.\r\nNot only did they gain control of these Cuban assets,\r\nbut, on 12 February of that same year, the Washington\r\nGovernment decided not to grant any loans to Cuba, not\r\neven the very modest one that was requested to support the\r\nCuban currency, which had been the victim of this brutal\r\nrobbery.\r\nThe economic war against Cuba began before the\r\nadoption of the first revolutionary measure, and long before\r\nthe Cuban revolution was proclaimed a socialist one. From\r\nthe very beginning, the war was, as it continues to be\r\ntoday, directed against the Cuban nation, against its\r\nindependence and against all the Cuban people.\r\nIn a United States State Department memorandum\r\ndated 24 June 1959, the essence of the policy already\r\nbeing implemented against Cuba was clearly set forth. It\r\nconsidered depriving Cuba of its quota in the United\r\nStates sugar market, so that\r\n“the sugar industry would promptly suffer an abrupt\r\nand immediate decline, causing widespread further\r\nunemployment. The large numbers of persons thus\r\nforced out of work would begin to go hungry.”\r\nAt the same meeting, United States Secretary of\r\nState Herter defined these initial steps as “measures of\r\neconomic warfare”. Another document, drafted on 6 April\r\n1960 and approved that same day, expanded the\r\naggression even further and was even more specific:\r\n“Every possible means should be undertaken\r\npromptly to weaken the economic life of Cuba...to\r\nbring about hunger, desperation and the overthrow\r\nof the Government.”\r\nA genocidal strategy was put into effect that has\r\nnow lasted for four decades. Three generations of Cubans\r\nhave suffered its consequences: two thirds of the current\r\nCuban population were born after it came into effect and\r\nhave lived their entire lives under it. The Cuban people\r\nhave had to suffer, survive and pursue their development\r\nunder totally unfair and unjustifiable conditions, imposed\r\nin the most cold-blooded and calculated manner by the\r\nmost powerful nation on earth, which is thereby seeking\r\nto destroy the Cuban nation and exterminate its people.\r\nThe blockade has been implemented by nine United\r\nStates Administrations. They have enforced it through\r\nlaws, regulations and by-laws in violation of both law and\r\nmorality; they have attempted to force other nations to\r\ncomply with it, thereby trampling on their sovereignty and\r\ndestroying international norms; they have threatened and\r\noppressed citizens of the United States and other\r\ncountries; and they have pressured and bribed people\r\neverywhere, attempting to deceive and manipulate the\r\nentire world.\r\nThis blockade has always been extraterritorial in\r\nnature, because it seeks to rob Cuba of its independence,\r\ntrample on the sovereignty of other countries and punish\r\nthe entire Cuban population with deliberate cruelty. That\r\nis the way it has always been, from the very first day, 40\r\nyears ago. For confirmation of that fact, we need only\r\nexamine the provisions contained in the Cuban Assets\r\nControl Regulations, which have been in effect since 8\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nJuly 1963. They include numerous illegal measures that\r\ninterfere with the legitimate economic and commercial\r\nactivities of foreign companies based outside United States\r\njurisdiction, as well as complete prohibitions not only\r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba, but against all Cuban\r\nnationals, without exception, residing in Cuban territory,\r\nwho are prevented from engaging in any transactions, while\r\nall of their property, deposits, savings, inheritances and\r\npensions in the United States have been confiscated.\r\nThe United States authorities have used innumerable\r\nmethods in carrying out with impunity the abominable\r\ncrime they are committing against my people. They have\r\nhad no qualms about lying to this very Assembly, as they\r\nwill surely do once again today.\r\nIt was very recently demonstrated beyond any doubt\r\nthat this genocidal policy has not been modified and that\r\nthose who are implementing it are prepared to do anything\r\nto prolong it indefinitely. Last August, by a vote of 70 to\r\n28, the United States Senate voted in favour of including an\r\namendment in the agricultural appropriations bill aimed at\r\nrevising the policy of unilateral economic sanctions\r\nimposed by Washington on other countries by eliminating\r\nthe prohibitions relating to food and medicine. While the\r\nUnited States Senate was promoting this initiative, Cuba\r\nbecame the only country in the world to which the United\r\nStates unilaterally prohibits the sale of food and medicine.\r\nOn 27 July the United States lifted its prohibition against\r\nIran, Libya and the Sudan, and on 17 September the\r\nprohibition against the People\u0027s Democratic Republic of\r\nKorea was removed.\r\nDespite its wide support in the Senate, the amendment\r\nwas not included in the text of the bill that was finally\r\nadopted. In order to eliminate the proposal, voting was\r\nblocked in the Senate/House conference committee, which\r\nwas arbitrarily shut down in violation of the usual\r\nlegislative practices and procedures of that country. A\r\nconsiderable number of United States lawmakers protested\r\nand denounced the unusual situation that forced them to\r\nadopt a text that did not represent the interests of the\r\nmajority. What led to that unprecedented action? Senators\r\nAshcroft and Brownback and Representative Nethercutt, the\r\nauthors of the amendment, signed a statement, which was\r\npublished on 20 October in The Washington Times, in\r\nwhich they explained why the vote on the amendment was\r\nblocked. They said that the reason — the sole reason —\r\nwas the belief that “The unilateral food and medicine\r\nembargo against Cuba must be maintained at any cost.”\r\nA few days ago, on 5 November, William Clinton\r\nhimself acknowledged that the decision to deny those\r\nproducts to Cuba had been the only reason for what\r\nhappened in Congress. Curiously, on that same day, when\r\nspeaking before a different audience, the President of the\r\nUnited States insisted on keeping the blockade in place\r\nand tried to justify it, although he had to admit that\r\nalmost everybody rejected it.\r\nThe group that controls the leadership of the United\r\nStates Congress went so far as to break with democratic\r\nprocedures in its determination to continue depriving the\r\nCuban people of food and medicine; they are now the\r\nonly people on earth against whom Washington is\r\nunilaterally applying such a criminal policy — a practice\r\nthat half a century ago was prohibited, even in time of\r\nwar, by the Geneva Conventions. As if that were not\r\nenough, by prohibiting its subsidiaries abroad from\r\ntrading — their sales in food and medicine totalled more\r\nthan $700 million — Washington is forcing others to\r\ncollude in this crime.\r\nIn order to ensure a total prohibition on exports of\r\nfood and medicine to Cuba, they have turned a deaf ear\r\nto the demands of farmers and other sectors of United\r\nStates society and have disregarded the views of most of\r\ntheir lawmakers. To deny the Cuban people access to\r\nfood and medicine from the United States, the\r\nperpetrators of this genocide have even resorted to this\r\n“affront” — to borrow the term used by the congressmen\r\nto whom I referred earlier — to their own legislative\r\nprocedures.\r\nWhat happened in the case of the Ashcroft\r\namendment proves that the blockade completely prevents\r\nexports of food and medicine to Cuba. If there were any\r\ntruth to the official United States propaganda, there would\r\nhave been no need for such an amendment, for the votes\r\nin favour cast by 70 senators or for the clumsy scheming\r\nto exclude the amendment from the final text of the bill.\r\nBy thwarting its approval, the supporters of the blockade\r\nhave defied the opinion of Congress while revealing their\r\ndetermination to maintain the most cruel and\r\ncondemnable aspects of a clearly genocidal policy.\r\nWhile acknowledging the noble intentions inspiring\r\nthose who strove to introduce this reform into current\r\nUnited States policy, I have to say that even if it had\r\nbeen adopted, it would have made little difference; nor\r\nwould it have made the blockade any less cruel and\r\ninhumane. How could we acquire food and medicine on\r\nthe United States market while a harsh blockade is\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nmaintained, denying us the resources we need for\r\ndevelopment and preventing normal trade with the United\r\nStates, a country which is also trying to sabotage our trade\r\nwith the rest of the world?\r\nThe blockade has created countless obstacles to Cuba\u0027s\r\neconomic development; it has made it impossible for Cuba\r\nto acquire products, equipment, goods, services and\r\ntechnology; it has deprived it of funding and credits; it has\r\ninflicted severe damage on its foreign trade by depressing\r\nthe prices of what we sell and raising the costs of imports\r\nand transportation; it has affected every sector of the\r\nnational economy, with severe consequences for the living\r\nconditions of our people.\r\nUnited States bureaucrats and diplomats have tirelessly\r\ndedicated themselves to tracking down, throughout the\r\nworld, every gram of Cuban nickel or sugar that might be\r\ncontained in some foreign product in order to ban it from\r\nthe United States market, and to preventing the sale to\r\nCuba of any foreign product that contains so much as a\r\nparticle of United States origin. This is the entirety of the\r\nblockade that must be completely, totally and\r\nunconditionally lifted.\r\nThe Government that it is my honour to represent is\r\nprepared to undertake every legal action to fight the\r\nblockade and to defend the rights of its people. In this\r\nconnection, I am officially announcing to the General\r\nAssembly that we shall be filing a lawsuit against the\r\nGovernment of the United States for compensation in the\r\namount of over $100 billion for the enormous damages\r\ncaused to the people of Cuba by the blockade, which has\r\nnow lasted over 40 years, since it actually began in 1959\r\nwith the first economic measures taken against our country.\r\nCuba has never capitulated and never shall. Despite\r\nthe tightening of the blockade and the acts of aggression, it\r\nhas succeeded in halting the downslide of its economy and\r\nhas begun a process of sustained and irreversible recovery.\r\nThe capacity for resistance of its heroic, self-\r\nsacrificing and noble people is founded on a unity and a\r\npatriotism that nothing and no one will ever be able to\r\ndestroy. Our people have travelled a long and hazardous\r\nroad in their endless struggle for independence and justice.\r\nThey know that the road ahead will not be easy either, but\r\nthey march on, full of confidence, because they believe in\r\nthe value of principles, and because they know that their\r\ncause is just and that it transcends the borders of their small\r\nterritory.\r\nThey also believe in international solidarity, in\r\nequality and fraternity among peoples and in the political\r\nand moral strength of the General Assembly, in whose\r\nvoice they trust.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Faithful to\r\nits history and to its national character, Mexico is a\r\ncountry committed to peace, justice and equality. The\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and of\r\ninternational law guide our relations with other States.\r\nThis is enshrined in the political Constitution of the\r\nRepublic of Mexico.\r\nThat is why Mexico has not promulgated or\r\nimplemented extraterritorial legal provisions. My\r\nGovernment reaffirms that measures such as the so-called\r\nHelms-Burton Act are unacceptable under international\r\nlaw and run counter to the purposes and principles to\r\nwhich we all committed ourselves by ratifying the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn each of the past seven years, the General\r\nAssembly, by an overwhelming majority, has called on\r\nStates to refrain from promulgating and applying laws\r\nthat have extraterritorial effects. It will do so today for\r\nthe eighth time. This appeal, which embodies the dictates\r\nof reason, law and ethics, must not continue to be\r\nignored. That is required by the harmony that must\r\nprevail in relations among all members of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nToday, as never before in the history of mankind,\r\nthe challenges of globalization make it clear that we will\r\nbe able to make progress towards higher levels of peace\r\nand development only through genuine international\r\ncooperation founded on full respect for the sovereignty of\r\nall nations and on commitments undertaken under\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe embargo against Cuba must end. My country\r\nhas always rejected the unilateral imposition of coercive\r\nmeasures in international relations. We must without\r\ndelay overcome this relic of another time, for it has no\r\nraison d\u0027être in the new millennium that we must build\r\ntogether. Only if we are united, if we respect our\r\ndifferences and if we are enriched by our diversity, and\r\nonly through dialogue, will we be able to realize the\r\nhopes of the founders of the Organization and achieve a\r\nfully human world that is a concrete reflection of our\r\nshared aspirations for peace, justice and equality.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nMexico will continue a high level of cooperation and\r\neconomic and trade exchanges with Cuba, a sister nation\r\nwith which we are linked by ties of history, geography and\r\nculture.\r\nIn accordance with our unswerving principles, the\r\ndelegation of Mexico will vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/54/L.11.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): First of all, I would like to\r\nexpress my delegation\u0027s appreciation for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report contained in document A/54/259, dated 18\r\nAugust 1999, on agenda item 33, entitled “Necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nThe report, which reproduces the replies from Governments\r\nand from organs and agencies of the United Nations, amply\r\ndemonstrates that the international community is opposed\r\nto the extraterritorial application of national legislation\r\nwhich violates the universally accepted principles of\r\ninternational law.\r\nOver the past several years the General Assembly has\r\nalready adopted by a growing majority, seven resolutions\r\nunder this item, calling for an end to the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the United\r\nStates against Cuba. During the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, resolution 53/4 was adopted by an\r\noverwhelming majority of 157 votes in favour, which\r\nclearly underscores the international community\u0027s rejection\r\nof the application of unilateral and coercive measures that\r\nare extraterritorial in scope.\r\nDespite the adoption of that resolution with a record\r\nnumber of affirmative votes, the United States further\r\ntightened embargo measures through stricter and more\r\nthorough monitoring of their application and the\r\nintroduction of new measures to intensify their enforcement\r\nagainst the will of the international community. Soon after\r\nthe adoption of resolution 53/4 by the General Assembly,\r\nthe United States Congress passed the Omnibus\r\nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 1999, which further\r\nreinforces the Helms-Burton Act. The economic blockade\r\nhas severely affected the socio-economic situation in Cuba.\r\nThe economic damage until 1998 has been estimated at $67\r\nbillion, and the estimated effect of the embargo on the\r\nCuban economy in recent years has exceeded 15 per cent\r\nof the country\u0027s annual domestic product.\r\nThe imposition of an embargo on crucial items such\r\nas medicines and food has adversely affected the health and\r\nnutritional situation in Cuba. It is most deplorable to learn\r\nthat the United States has even deprived Cuba of the\r\nopportunity to purchase medicines, equipment or medical\r\nsupplies from other countries through the application of\r\nthe Torricelli and Helms-Burton Acts and other embargo\r\nregulations. My delegation is strongly opposed to such\r\nunjust measures and calls for ending the embargo. As we\r\nenter the new millennium, the necessity of ending the\r\nUnited States economic, commercial and financial\r\nblockade against Cuba becomes more imperative than\r\never.\r\nIt is encouraging to learn from today\u0027s news that\r\nafter almost 40 years, commercial flights between New\r\nYork and Havana will resume next month. We sincerely\r\nhope that such a development will pave the way for\r\nenhancing contacts between the two peoples.\r\nMyanmar is of the view that the promulgation and\r\napplication by Member States of laws and regulations, the\r\nextraterritorial aspects of which affect the sovereignty of\r\nother States, the legitimate interest of entities or persons\r\nunder their jurisdiction and freedom of trade and of\r\nnavigation, violate the universally adopted principles of\r\ninternational law. In the interest of upholding the\r\nprinciples of international law and the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, the delegation of Myanmar, consistent\r\nwith its stand in previous years, will vote in favour of\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.11.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People\u0027s Democratic Republic)\r\n(spoke in French): My delegation very much regrets that\r\nthe General Assembly, for the eighth consecutive year,\r\nmust once again take up the agenda item on the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by\r\nthe United States of America against Cuba.\r\nThis embargo, which has gone on for more than 30\r\nyears, has no raison d\u0027être and serves the interests of\r\nneither of the two parties involved. What is worse, it\r\nviolates the sovereignty of other States and the freedom\r\nof trade and of navigation. In our view, the embargo\r\nshould end, and everything must be done to support and\r\nassist this developing country, the Republic of Cuba, so\r\nthat it can be reintegrated into the liberalized and\r\nglobalized world economy.\r\nLike all peace-loving peoples in the world, the\r\nCuban people seeks only to live in peace and dignity.\r\nCertainly this brave people would also very much like to\r\npromote its economic relations with all the peoples of the\r\nworld, including the American people. The international\r\ncommunity must do its utmost to encourage the two\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nparties, the Republic of Cuba and the United States, to\r\nseriously continue their negotiations and come to an\r\nagreement in order to resolve their differences as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nThe blockade against Cuba, which is anachronistic and\r\neven has extraterritorial effects, is absurd. Unfortunately,\r\nthe blockade still goes on and is even being tightened. We\r\nbelieve it is unfair to punish a people — an entire\r\npeople — that has not committed any crime. Is it not high\r\ntime to put an end to this restrictive commercial practice\r\nthat runs counter to the present global trend favouring\r\ndialogue and international economic cooperation? It is in\r\nthis spirit that my delegation will vote in favour of draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.11.\r\nMr. Dorda (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I am not here merely to reaffirm that we will vote\r\nin favour of the draft resolution now before the Assembly.\r\nThis is obvious to delegations, and there can be no doubt\r\nabout it. I am addressing the Assembly in order to\r\ncongratulate the Cuban people — the people of a small\r\ncountry that for 40 years has stayed the course, maintaining\r\nits opposition to the United States and thus furnishing proof\r\nthat it can live in full freedom on its national soil, despite\r\nthe presence of a pernicious neighbouring Power, that does\r\nnot respect the international community or international law\r\nor conventions. It does not even respect itself.\r\nWith regard to the Cuban people, they deserve\r\nwhatever support and respect we can give them because\r\nthey have chosen to live in freedom and dignity, even if\r\nthis dignity demands privations because of the blockade and\r\nthe attacks on their sovereignty. The Cubans have not\r\naccepted a fistful of dollars in exchange for their dignity.\r\nThe Cuban people serves as a model for all peoples\r\nwho thought that after the disappearance of the former\r\ninternational balance of power, the United States would\r\nbecome the new god. I urge all those whose faith has been\r\ndestabilized and threatened to renew their faith in God,\r\nbecause God alone and no one else can help them in their\r\nresolve. Not the United States, nor any other world Power,\r\ncan take the place of the Almighty.\r\nI call upon all peoples whose leaderships have begun\r\nto bow down before the United States, not to accept the\r\nviolation of their dignity, their territorial integrity and their\r\nsovereignty. I urge them to model themselves on the Cuban\r\npeople, who have maintained their existence and freedom,\r\nopposed their powerful neighbour and refused to bend to its\r\nwill.\r\nA life of dignity, even for one day, will go down in\r\nhistory, and posterity will truly remember it. The United\r\nStates is not a god and has no real power. Power belongs\r\nto God alone.\r\nThe official United States position vis-à-vis Cuba is\r\npart of an enormous campaign that has been cleverly\r\norchestrated and manipulated. If the United States really\r\nwanted democracy in Cuba, it would not have supported\r\nBatista. Nor would the United States have supported the\r\nIranian Shah, the dictator par excellence, nor would it\r\nhave given Mobutu its absolute support. The United\r\nStates continues to support non-democratic regimes,\r\ndictatorial regimes. The United States is concerned only\r\nabout its own interests, not democracy.\r\nThis country that talks of international principles, of\r\ninternational norms, must, first and foremost, respect\r\nthose norms itself. The United States shows absolutely no\r\nrespect for human rights, nor for the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. How can it dare to deprive the Cuban\r\npeople of the right to purchase medicines, foodstuffs and\r\nother essential goods from American markets? By what\r\nright can the United States do this? Or is humanity\r\nmonopolized by the interests of United States citizens\r\nalone?\r\nWe protest the absurd unilateral adoption by one\r\nState of laws that seek to govern all of humanity. Cuba\r\nand all the free countries of the world that cherish their\r\ndignity and freedom have the right to protest these\r\nunilateral actions and must reject them. The United States\r\nwants to dictate its will to the world; the rest of us are,\r\napparently, outlawed by the legislation of the United\r\nStates, because we believe in God and have profound\r\nfaith in ourselves. We will not bend to America\u0027s will.\r\nI say to those States that thought that the end of the\r\nworld would come with the disappearance of the old\r\nbalance of power, “Follow Cuba\u0027s example.” Cuba is a\r\nmodel for us. The Cuban people have preserved their\r\ndignity and freedom, because to live in dignity for one\r\nday is to be valued above all else.\r\nLibya will support the Cuban people in their\r\nsuffering, as we have always done with oppressed\r\npeoples, so as to prevent one State from controlling our\r\nworld. In our country, as in Cuba, we want to preserve\r\nour freedom, independence and resources, and so we\r\nproudly say to that one State, “No”.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina): (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is meeting once again to consider the\r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo against the Republic of Cuba. In this context, the\r\nArgentine Republic wishes to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report, in which we are offered a\r\ncomplete overview of the perceptions of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy country believes that representative democracy, in\r\nthe framework of plurality and freedom of the press, is the\r\nbest political system for guaranteeing respect for human\r\nrights and individual freedoms. In the area of development,\r\nwe maintain that economic freedoms and private initiative\r\nare the engine of the true growth of nations.\r\nWithin this concept of the world and society, which is\r\ninseparably linked to the idea of freedom, Argentina\r\nmaintains that unrestricted respect for the letter and the\r\nspirit of the United Nations Charter is the essential\r\nfoundation that sustains the functioning of the international\r\ncommunity. In that sense, the application of unilateral\r\neconomic and trade measures against one State and their\r\nextraterritorial implementation affect the freedom of the\r\nStates Members of the Organization in a way that does not\r\nseem compatible with the Charter.\r\nThe Argentine Republic feels that any dispute that\r\nmay emerge in the bilateral relations between two countries\r\nmust be channelled through the procedures established in\r\nthe Charter. We are also convinced that the lifting of the\r\nembargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba is the best way\r\nto promote freedom of trade, communications, flexibility\r\nand dialogue, the irreplaceable means of promoting change\r\ntowards a representative democracy in Cuba.\r\nThe Argentine Republic has promulgated an act\r\nestablishing that foreign legislation which is aimed, directly\r\nor indirectly, at restricting or impending the free flow of\r\ntrade and the movement of capital, goods or persons to the\r\ndetriment of a given country or group of countries shall\r\nneither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind\r\nwithin Argentine territory. Furthermore, foreign legislation\r\nwhich seeks to have extraterritorial legal effects through the\r\nimposition of an economic embargo or limits on investment\r\nin a given country in order to promote a change in the form\r\nof government of a country or affect its right to self-\r\ndetermination shall also be utterly inapplicable and devoid\r\nof legal effect.\r\nArgentina will therefore vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution before us.\r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh (Viet Nam): The Vietnamese\r\ndelegation attaches great importance to the question of the\r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against\r\nCuba, under consideration by the General Assembly.\r\nDuring the past seven consecutive sessions, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has had this item on its agenda and\r\nadopted, with overwhelming support from member\r\ncountries, the resolutions urging an immediate end to\r\npolicies that resort to the application of extraterritorial\r\nlaws and coercive measures against a sovereign nation.\r\nThese policies violate the most fundamental principles\r\nand purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations, namely, the principles of national sovereignty,\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States and\r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation.\r\nOnce again, my delegation wishes to join the\r\ninternational community in calling upon the United States\r\nof America to put an end to the embargo and blockade it\r\nhas imposed on the Republic of Cuba for so many years.\r\nThe policies of embargo and blockade have caused huge\r\nmaterial losses and economic damage to the Cuban\r\npeople. Viet Nam firmly holds that there is no\r\njustification for the continuation by one day further of\r\nthese hostile policies. In fact, these policies should never\r\nhave been applied in any case.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to underline that the\r\ndifferences between the United States and the Republic of\r\nCuba should be settled through the means of dialogue and\r\nnegotiation on the basis of mutual respect and respect for\r\nthe independence and sovereignty of States. In line with\r\nthis, Viet Nam welcomes every effort of the parties\r\nconcerned to this effect.\r\nIn conclusion, Viet Nam reaffirms its unwavering\r\nsupport, cooperation and solidarity with the Cuban people\r\nand Government. Together with all the peace-, freedom-\r\nand justice-loving nations of the world, the Vietnamese\r\npeople will continue to do its utmost to assist the Cuban\r\npeople to overcome the impact of the embargo and\r\nblockade imposed upon them. Viet Nam will therefore\r\nagain vote in favour of the draft resolution under\r\nconsideration.\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): For the eighth consecutive year, the General\r\nAssembly is considering the item on the necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nThe United Nations Charter enshrines the right of\r\nStates to exercise sovereignty over their territory, as well as\r\nthe principle of non-interference in their internal affairs. All\r\nUnited Nations Members, in particular the major Powers,\r\nare expected to respect the provisions of the Charter, which\r\nserves as the constitution of the Organization and its\r\nsupreme law.\r\nThe blockade that has been imposed against Cuba for\r\nmore than four decades has caused that country grave\r\neconomic, social and political harm. This situation has been\r\na source of constant concern to the international community\r\nin recent decades and it is high time to resolve this thorny\r\nproblem.\r\nThe Syrian delegation pays tribute to Cuba, which has\r\nrepeatedly declared its desire to resolve the problem of the\r\nembargo through dialogue. We therefore support Cuba\u0027s\r\nsincere appeal to the United States to establish constructive\r\ndialogue to resolve all the differences between them on the\r\nbasis of equality, mutual respect, non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs and good-neighbourly relations.\r\nA cursory review of the results of the voting on the\r\nresolution submitted under this item for the past seven\r\nyears clearly reveals that the number of countries\r\nsupporting it has constantly increased, while abstentions and\r\nvotes against it have significantly decreased. This is a\r\nstriking illustration of the international community\u0027s\r\nsympathy for Cuba and its support for the need to lift the\r\nembargo and to respect the political, economic and social\r\nsystems chosen by each Government of its own accord,\r\nbased on its appropriate national interests. We wish to\r\nreaffirm that any measures taken by a State that could,\r\nbecause of territorial considerations, harm or violate the\r\nsovereignty of another State, run counter to the principle of\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of Member States. In this\r\ncontext, we also wish to recall the content of the\r\nDeclaration adopted at summit of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement in Durban, where the non-aligned countries\r\nurged the United States to lift the embargo, which has\r\ndragged on for too long and which runs counter to the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law.\r\nThe international community has repeatedly expressed\r\nits rejection of the Helms-Burton Act adopted by the United\r\nStates, which transcends the concept of national jurisdiction\r\nand violates the sovereignty of other States that conduct\r\nbusiness with Cuba. This Act and subsequent legislative\r\namendments, particularly the 1999 American Omnibus\r\nAppropriations Act, which contains 12 amendments on\r\nCuba, defy the fundamental principle of respect for the\r\nsovereignty of States. All these laws violate international\r\ntrade agreements and are an affront to the will of peoples.\r\nFor all these reasons, my delegation will vote in favour of\r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/54/L.11,\r\nsubmitted today to the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ouane (Mali)(spoke in French): Starting eight\r\nyears ago, the General Assembly has adopted by an ever-\r\ngrowing majority resolutions on the necessity of lifting\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nagainst Cuba by the United States of America.\r\nSimilarly, the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, held at Durban in September 1998, reiterated\r\nthe Movement\u0027s position, that the international community\r\nmust oppose all acts of interference, external intervention\r\nand coercive economic measures and other measures,\r\nincluding extraterritorial laws and regulations that affect\r\nthe sovereignty of States, the legitimate interests of\r\nentities and persons under their jurisdiction and the\r\nfreedom of trade and of navigation.\r\nIn keeping with these positions and on the basis of\r\nthe relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter and\r\nuniversally recognized principles of international law,\r\nMali will this year again associate itself with the Member\r\nStates calling for the lifting the economic, commercial\r\nand financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Mali reaffirms\r\nthe importance it attaches to respect for the principles of\r\nthe sovereign equality of States, non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs and freedom of trade and of international\r\nnavigation, as recalled in draft resolution A/54/L.11,\r\nintroduced by Cuba.\r\nThis is why we continue to oppose the\r\nextraterritorial application of national laws, which, in\r\naddition to constituting a violation of the relevant\r\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter and international\r\nlaw, contravenes the principles and objectives of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization.\r\nIn the opinion of the Mali delegation, the two\r\nparties, Cuba and the United States, must take steps to\r\nresolve their disputes through dialogue and negotiation.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Mali is seriously\r\nconcerned about the repercussions of the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. As\r\nindicated by the report contained in document A/54/259,\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nthe embargo has seriously hampered the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of Cuba and has worsened the plight of\r\nmillions of Cubans, particularly the most vulnerable groups,\r\nsuch as children, women and the elderly.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that, in keeping with\r\nits position of principle, Mali will vote in favour of the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/54/L.11.\r\nMr. Kasanda (Zambia): I shall begin by thanking the\r\nSecretary-General for his report contained in document\r\nA/54/259, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the United\r\nStates of America against Cuba”. My delegation is equally\r\ngrateful to the Cuban delegation for introducing draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.11 on this matter.\r\nOver the years, when the General Assembly has\r\nconsidered this subject, Zambia has voted against the\r\nembargo imposed on Cuba. We shall again this year vote\r\nin favour of the draft resolution before us. Our vote is\r\nbased on our adherence to the principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIn this respect, we firmly believe that the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba and the\r\nHelms-Burton legislation are a breach of international law\r\nand a violation of the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter. The extraterritorial nature of the Helms-Burton Act\r\nis an infringement of the territorial integrity of States and\r\nan impediment to international navigation and free trade, as\r\nembodied in the World Trade Organization Final Act.\r\nThe Government of Zambia is greatly concerned with\r\nthe adverse effects of the economic blockade, which has\r\naggravated the plight of the Cuban people, especially\r\nvulnerable groups, such as children, women and the elderly.\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the General Assembly\r\nhas repeatedly adopted numerous resolutions demanding the\r\nlifting of the economic embargo against Cuba. Zambia\r\ndisagrees with the extraterritorial implementation of national\r\nlaws, such as the Helms-Burton Act, because such laws fly\r\nin the face of the principle of sovereign equality of States\r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of States. Years\r\nafter the end of the cold war, we very much regret attempts\r\nto condition and erode the principles of friendly and\r\ncooperative relationships between States.\r\nZambia\u0027s foreign policy is based, inter alia, on the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States, non-\r\ninterference and the peaceful coexistence of nations. In this\r\nrespect, I would like to state that Zambia has not\r\npromulgated or applied domestic laws vis-à-vis any State\r\nthat would have extraterritorial jurisdiction. Zambia\r\nstrives to fulfil in good faith the obligations it assumes in\r\ninternational agreements and conventions.\r\nThe Government of Zambia is committed to\r\npromoting freedom of navigation and of trade. As both a\r\nlandlocked and transit country, Zambia has consistently\r\nreaffirmed the right of access of both landlocked and\r\ntransit States to and from the sea by all means of\r\ntransportation, in accordance with international law, and\r\nit is also committed to developing rule-based trade with\r\nall countries of the world.\r\nIt is against this background of principles and\r\nrespect for the rights and independence of other States\r\nthat my delegation once again calls for the complete\r\nlifting of the embargo against Cuba. We are pleased to\r\nnote that our relations with Cuba are based on mutual\r\nrespect and the principle of non-interference in each\r\nother\u0027s internal affairs. We believe that these values are\r\npart of the foundation on which healthy relations between\r\nStates should be based.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): The item entitled “Necessity\r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America against\r\nCuba” has been on the agenda of the General Assembly\r\nfor the last seven consecutive years.\r\nThe adoption of resolution 53/4 of 14 October 1998\r\nby an overwhelming majority of the General Assembly,\r\nas in the resolutions of previous years, was a clear\r\nrejection by this Assembly and the international\r\ncommunity of the unilateral embargo against Cuba by the\r\nUnited States of America. The draft resolution before us\r\ntoday, which my delegation wholeheartedly supports, will\r\nundoubtedly secure the same, if not an increased, level of\r\nsupport. The message is clear: the international\r\ncommunity does not support the unilateral efforts by the\r\nUnited States to effect extraterritorial application of what\r\nis essentially a domestic law upon Cuba, a sovereign\r\nState and a Member of this Organization.\r\nThe rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba\r\nwas also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned\r\ncountries during their twelfth summit meeting, held in\r\nDurban in September 1998; Malaysia strongly supported\r\nthe final document of that summit, wherein the heads of\r\nState or Government of the non-aligned countries\r\nreiterated their call upon the Government of the United\r\nStates of America to put an end to the economic,\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\ncommercial and financial actions against Cuba. This\r\nposition was further reiterated in the final communiqué of\r\nthe meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, held in New York on 23 September 1999.\r\nMalaysia joins other countries in expressing its serious\r\nconcern at the continued economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo on Cuba by the United States, which has\r\ngravely impeded Cuba\u0027s socio-economic development and\r\naggravated the plight of the Cuban people. We view this\r\npolicy as being not only coercive but also utterly\r\ndiscriminatory in nature and a clear breach of the norms of\r\ninternational law; it runs counter to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. That it is directed\r\nagainst a poor and small developing country that poses no\r\nthreat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying,\r\nespecially when the United States considers itself a\r\nchampion and promoter of global free trade, in which\r\ncapital and goods should be able to move freely across\r\nnational borders without unnecessary impediment.\r\nNeedless to say, the extraterritorial reach of the\r\nHelms-Burton Law has caused enormous economic damage\r\nand untold suffering to the people of Cuba. Mr. Alarcón,\r\nthe President of the National Assembly of the Republic of\r\nCuba, eloquently highlighted in his statement this morning\r\nthe enormity of the impact of this legislation on his people.\r\nAt the same time, this United States law also damages the\r\ninterests of third States by inhibiting commercial\r\ntransactions with Cuba. As a staunch advocate of free trade\r\nand relations between nations, on the basis of respect for\r\nthe norms and principles of international law, and consistent\r\nwith its own cherished values and traditions, the United\r\nStates clearly cannot persist in its current policy against\r\nCuba, with its serious humanitarian impact on the lives of\r\nthe valiant Cuban people.\r\nMy delegation had hoped in past years that the\r\noverwhelming rejection by the international community of\r\nthis discriminatory policy vis-à-vis Cuba would influence\r\nthe United States to review its overall approach towards its\r\nneighbour and to evolve its policy of isolating Cuba to one\r\nof dialogue and accommodation, as befits relations between\r\ntwo geographically close neighbours. This remains our\r\nhope.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): I would like to begin by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his report contained in\r\ndocument A/54/259. I am equally grateful to the Cuban\r\ndelegation for introducing draft resolution A/54/L.11,\r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba”.\r\nIn this regard, it is pertinent to mention that\r\nIndonesia has always been a country committed to justice,\r\nequality and peace. The Constitution of Indonesia clearly\r\nstipulates the importance of these principles. Their\r\nimplementation is a fundamental obligation contained in\r\nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter and\r\ngenerally recognized principles of international law.\r\nTherefore, Indonesia has consistently renounced the use\r\nof coercive measures as a means of exerting pressure in\r\nrelations among the Member States of the Organization.\r\nIn this connection, it is regrettable to note that for\r\nthe past 37 years a unilateral economic embargo has been\r\nimposed on Cuba, reflecting the continuation of untenable\r\npast policies. Furthermore, we are appalled by the\r\napplication of a national act that has extraterritorial\r\nramifications.\r\nExperience has shown that sanctions rarely serve\r\ntheir purposes; they only inflict immense material loss\r\nand economic damage on the civilian population of the\r\ntargeted State. For this compelling reason, in the last\r\nseven years, the General Assembly has adopted\r\nresolutions on the need to end the economic, commercial\r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States on\r\nCuba. It is important to highlight that the number of\r\nStates in support of this resolution has increased year\r\nafter year. Last year 157 States, or 85 per cent of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations, supported resolution\r\n53/4.\r\nAt a time when many countries have focused\r\nattention on the necessity of humanitarian intervention in\r\nconflicts, it is difficult, at least to my delegation, to\r\nunderstand the reasoning behind the imposition of such\r\nsanctions considering the profound socio-economic\r\nconsequences. It is equally difficult to comprehend the\r\nrationalization advanced to justify subordinating the right\r\nof people to live in economic sufficiency.\r\nWith the coming of a new millennium it is\r\nencouraging to note that many changes in political\r\nperspectives and policies have actually crystallized,\r\nsignalling the emergence of a positive new era. In that\r\ncontext, we are of the view that the time is ripe to adopt\r\na realistic policy towards Cuba involving a transition from\r\nisolation to positive engagement.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nMy delegation firmly believes that the settlement of\r\ndisputes among United Nations Member States should be\r\ncarried out through dialogue and negotiations guided by the\r\nCharter and based on the principles of sovereignty,\r\nsovereign equality of States and good neighbourliness.\r\nIn this light, it is pertinent to note that the meeting of\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs and heads of delegations of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement during the fifty-fourth session\r\nof the General Assembly, held in New York on 23\r\nSeptember 1999, once again called on the parties concerned\r\nto strictly comply with the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions and emphasized the need to terminate the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial sanctions against Cuba.\r\nFor these reasons, my delegation will vote in favour\r\nof the draft resolution before the Assembly.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): I wish once again to\r\nreiterate my Government\u0027s position on the continued\r\nextraterritorial extension of the commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed on the Government and the people of the\r\nRepublic of Cuba by the United States of America.\r\nNamibia has repeatedly advocated an end to this\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo, for we firmly\r\nbelieve that the Helms-Burton Act and the D\u0027Amato\r\nlegislation are a breach of international law and a violation\r\nof the principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nMoreover, these punitive measures are contrary to the\r\nspirit of the much-talked-about globalization, peaceful\r\ncoexistence and open trade.\r\nThe economic embargo continues to have a negative\r\nimpact upon the economic development of Cuba and has\r\nmade it extremely difficult for the country to purchase the\r\nfood, medicine, fuel and raw materials needed to sustain the\r\nlives of the Cuban people. As a result, enormous suffering\r\nhas been inflicted upon the Cuban people, especially\r\nwomen and children.\r\nThe rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba\r\nwas also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned\r\ncountries during their twelfth summit meeting, held in\r\nDurban, South Africa, in September 1998, as contained in\r\nthe final document, which Namibia strongly supported. In\r\nthat document, the heads of State or Government of the\r\nnon-aligned countries reiterated their collective call upon\r\nthe Government of the United States of America to put an\r\nend to the economic, commercial and financial actions\r\nagainst Cuba. This position was further reiterated in the\r\nfinal communiqué of the meeting of Foreign Ministers of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement held in New York on 23\r\nSeptember 1999.\r\nIn this regard, Namibia, which maintains and enjoys\r\nexcellent relations with both the United States of America\r\nand Cuba, urges the immediate lifting of this embargo for\r\nthe benefit of the people of the two countries.\r\nFor these sound and practical reasons, Namibia will\r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/54/L.11, which was introduced earlier by\r\nMr. Ricardo Alarcón de Quesada, President of the\r\nNational Assembly of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): The agenda item entitled\r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba” is again before the General\r\nAssembly for consideration.\r\nMy delegation joins others in calling for an end to\r\nthe unilateral economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America against\r\nCuba. We do so out of our firm belief in the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nneed to adhere to them.\r\nIn keeping with its policy, Jamaica maintains no\r\nlegislation or measures that would affect the sovereignty\r\nof any State or the legitimate interests of its nationals or\r\nwould hinder the freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nJamaica is strongly opposed to the extraterritorial\r\napplication of national legislation.\r\nAs the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Jamaica, stated in his address to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session,\r\n“The continuation of the embargo against Cuba is a\r\nsource of tension and carries the risk of conflict,\r\nwhich is particularly troubling for neighbouring\r\nStates.” (A/54/PV.17, p.4)\r\nJamaica would like to see progress in the\r\nestablishment of a regime of peace and cooperation in the\r\nCaribbean Sea, and to this end, we urge both parties to\r\nengage in a constructive process of dialogue to bring an\r\nend to policies of confrontation and exclusion, with a\r\nview to normalizing relations.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nAccordingly, my delegation supports the content of the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/54/L.11 and will\r\nvote in favour of its adoption.\r\nMr. Bandora (United Republic of Tanzania): As in\r\nmany years in the past, the Assembly is again considering\r\nthe issue of the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the Government of the United States\r\nagainst Cuba without any indication that this unjustified\r\nmeasure will be lifted any time soon.\r\nMy delegation regrets that despite numerous appeals\r\nand the resolutions of the General Assembly, the United\r\nStates has not yet found it possible to bring an end to these\r\nunilateral measures that continue to strangulate the economy\r\nof a Member State and hinder international trade and\r\ncooperation. We regret in particular that the embargo\r\ncontinues to cause undue suffering to the Cuban people, not\r\nonly through its destructive economic effects but also by\r\nvirtue of the limitation it has often imposed on international\r\nresponse to humanitarian need in that country.\r\nWe have noted the limited measures allowed by the\r\nUnited States Government to expand the scope of people-\r\nto-people contacts between Cuba and the United States. We\r\nremain concerned, however, that there is no indication of a\r\npath designed to expand on these measures and bring the\r\nparties to dialogue.\r\nWe further continue to be concerned that the so-called\r\nHelms-Burton Act, with its overly broad and unacceptable\r\nimplications for the sovereignty of other States, remains an\r\ninstrument of reference in the United States. The Assembly,\r\nas well as the Non-Aligned Movement, has taken a clear\r\nposition against the Helms-Burton Act as legislation without\r\nlegitimacy and lacking legality under international law.\r\nTanzania continues to support that position, as we do the\r\nimperative for a dialogue between the two countries. We\r\nsee enormous possibilities for cooperation between the two\r\nStates, in spite of their differences. We do not see those\r\ndifferences as justifying the embargo, nor the far-reaching\r\nlegislative measures undertaken by the United States against\r\nCuba.\r\nWe also continue to be profoundly moved by the plea\r\nmade on behalf of the Cuban people by Pope John Paul II\r\nfollowing his visit to that country last year. The Pope’s plea\r\nis one that over the years the Assembly, and our countries\r\nindividually, has sought to underscore and reinforce at\r\nevery turn. We urge our friends in the United States to heed\r\nthat plea. We urge them to move away from the limiting\r\nand destructive legacies of history and to re-engage Cuba\r\nin an expanded dialogue that will lead to the ending of\r\nthe embargo and the normalization of relations between\r\nthe two countries.\r\nMr. Bivero (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMultilateralism, represented by this Organization, is\r\nuniversally recognized as one of the best ways to promote\r\nsolutions to common problems that, because of their\r\nnature and scope, require collective responses. It is for\r\nthis reason that Venezuela shares the belief that there is\r\na need for the General Assembly to continue considering\r\nthe item on the necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the United\r\nStates of America against Cuba.\r\nIn the context of the process of growing\r\ninterdependence, even as calls are being made for free\r\naccess to financial markets, goods, services, it is\r\nparadoxical to witness situations in which obstacles to\r\nsuch interaction are erected unilaterally and without\r\nregard for their effects upon the human development of\r\na people — even more so when we see that those\r\nobstacles are erected by applying internal norms with\r\nextraterritorial scope or effects that run counter to\r\ninternational public law.\r\nVenezuela rejects the application of unilateral\r\ncoercive measures such as the Helms-Burton Law because\r\nwe believe that such actions violate the sovereignty of\r\nStates, affect the legitimate interests of entities and\r\ncitizens under the jurisdiction of third parties and\r\nundermine the rules of free trade stipulated by the World\r\nTrade Organization. That is why we wish to take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate the content of the Asunción\r\nDeclaration, which was adopted at the Eleventh Summit\r\nof Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group, as\r\nwell as other, similar statements issued by our region’s\r\nPermanent Mechanism for Consultation and Concerted\r\nPolitical Action.\r\nWe would also like to point out that at the seventh\r\nIbero-American Summit, held on Margarita Island,\r\nVenezuela, in November 1997, the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of that group of countries also expressed\r\ntheir rejection of the application of that law because they\r\nbelieved that it violated the principles governing\r\ninternational coexistence and ran counter to the spirit of\r\ncooperation and friendship that should characterize\r\nrelations among all the members of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nAt a time when the international community is moving\r\ntowards the consolidation of democracy and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, it is necessary to join efforts so that all States\r\nresolve their disputes in accordance with the measures\r\nrecognized by international law, and not by political and\r\neconomic coercion or any other type of pressure that\r\nundermines the sovereignty of States. Venezuela believes\r\nthat the embargo against Cuba is contrary to international\r\nlaw, the self-determination of peoples and human\r\ndevelopment. We hope that it will be possible to put an end\r\nto it soon.\r\nIn the light of these considerations, our delegation will\r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/54/L.11, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the United\r\nStates of America against Cuba”.\r\nMr. Tchoulkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Russia supports the draft resolution before the\r\nGeneral Assembly, entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by\r\nthe United States of America against Cuba”, and shares the\r\nview of the overwhelming majority of Member States of\r\nthe United Nations in support of lifting the embargo\r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba, a unilateral\r\nmeasure that violates the provisions of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the basic norms of international law and\r\njustice.\r\nWe are convinced that the continuing commercial and\r\neconomic blockade against Cuba by the United Sates is a\r\nrelic of the cold war and that it should be halted. We\r\ncontinue to oppose steps by the United States to tighten the\r\nembargo and, in particular, to expand the extraterritorial,\r\nand therefore illegal, effect of the Cuban Liberty and\r\nDemocratic Solidarity Act of 12 March 1996. We believe\r\nthat, on the whole, this law is discriminatory and that it\r\nruns counter to the norms of international law and the\r\nprinciples of free trade.\r\nRussia is seriously concerned about attempts by the\r\nUnited States to exert pressure on third countries and\r\ncertain international organizations so that they will curtail\r\ntheir cooperation with Cuba. Those attempts are clearly at\r\nvariance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations. Our approach to this problem is that\r\nlifting the economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba, in particular,\r\nand the normalization of United States-Cuban relations, in\r\ngeneral, would help improve the situation in the region and\r\nwould be conducive to Cuba’s greater integration into world\r\neconomic relations, thus helping it advance along the path\r\nof reform.\r\nRussia, for its part, abides strictly by the principles\r\nset out in resolution 53/4, entitled “Necessity of ending\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. These\r\nprinciples are the sovereign equality of States, non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs, and freedom of trade\r\nand international navigation. We reaffirm our intention to\r\ncontinue to develop normal commercial and economic\r\nrelations with Cuba, based on common interest and\r\nmutual benefit and implemented in strict accordance with\r\nour obligations under the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand generally recognized principles and norms of\r\ninternational law, without any discrimination or jeopardy\r\nto the legal rights and interests of the parties.\r\nOf course, the Russian delegation will vote in favour\r\nof the draft resolution before us.\r\nMr. Eltom (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): For the eighth\r\nsuccessive year, the General Assembly is debating an\r\nextremely important question: that of the continued\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\ncoercively, unilaterally and unjustly by the United States\r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nAt all previous sessions, the Assembly renewed its\r\nunequivocal rejection of the promulgation and application\r\nof similar measures. We are fully convinced that they\r\nrepresent a clear and blatant violation of the principles of\r\ninternational law, those regulating the free flow and other\r\nnorms of international trade. They also violate the\r\nprinciple of the sovereignty of States and of the sovereign\r\nequality between large and small nations.\r\nThe report (A/54/259) of the Secretary-General\r\nshows, as have his previous reports on the subject, the\r\ndestructive results of the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral\r\nmeasure. The report also shows the adverse impact of the\r\nembargo on the vital sectors of the Cuban economy,\r\nparticularly the agricultural and health-care sectors.\r\nDespite the declaration by the State enforcing this\r\narbitrary measure that amendments to its policy will allow\r\nfor the export of food and medicine to alleviate the\r\nhumanitarian hardships faced by the Cuban people, the\r\nsituation, as described by the Cuban Government, is very\r\ndifferent. The United States still enforces the provisions\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nof the embargo against Cuba strictly and comprehensively.\r\nIt continues to issue official warnings and threats with the\r\nintent of punishing companies that invest in Cuba. All\r\ninitiatives to amend these provisions have been thwarted.\r\nThe unilateral and coercive economic embargo\r\nimposed by the United States, as an important element of\r\nits foreign policy designed to promote its self-interest, has\r\naffected other developing countries, including the Sudan.\r\nThis has been the case since November 1997. The United\r\nStates, not satisfied with applying unilateral economic\r\nmeasures against the Sudan, has also carried out attacks\r\nagainst its development projects, economic infrastructure\r\nand its scarce resources and limited capabilities. It launched\r\nits military act of aggression against the Al-Shifa\r\npharmaceutical plant in August of last year. The United\r\nStates still seeks, through the use of various coercive\r\nmeasures, to obstruct the process of peaceful settlement of\r\nthe conflict in my country, in a way that all representatives\r\nare familiar with.\r\nThis unilateral attempt to impose coercive measures\r\nconstitutes a clear and blatant violation of the norms of\r\ninternational law and of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIt jeopardizes the right of nations to choose and adopt their\r\nown political systems and development strategies. The\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly have already\r\nhighlighted the adverse effects of these measures, which\r\ninclude obstructing the free flow of trade and the transfer\r\nof technology to developing countries. This prevents such\r\nStates from taking part in the process of integration and\r\nconstructive interaction among States, which aims at\r\nbuilding a better future for humankind. This should occur\r\nunder sound international circumstances, with full respect\r\nfor the sovereignty of all States, large and small.\r\nThese measures deprive States of their right to\r\ndevelopment — one of the most important of human rights.\r\nThus, the imposition of economic sanctions is a blatant\r\nviolation of human rights.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of the Sudan expresses\r\nonce again its firm rejection of the promulgation and\r\napplication of extra-territorial laws. My delegation therefore\r\nurges the lifting of the unjust embargoes in effect against\r\nCuba, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Sudan and all other\r\nStates which are the targets of such coercive unilateral\r\nmeasures.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its support for the draft\r\nresolution presented by Cuba and will vote in its favour.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): For 40 years\r\nnow, the United States has imposed its inhumane\r\nembargo against Cuba, in violation of the principles of\r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law. This\r\nhas taken the lives of thousands of Cubans and caused\r\ngreat suffering for 11 million more, as has been shown by\r\nmany impartial international reports.\r\nThe more voices are heard around the world calling\r\nfor the end of this inhumane embargo, the more United\r\nStates intransigence increases and the more the embargo\r\ntightens. Now it is affecting other peoples besides the\r\nCubans. The Helms-Burton Act has had devastating\r\neffects on other States. It is a direct violation of the\r\nsovereignty of other States and of their right to free trade\r\nwith Cuba. Furthermore, it represents a blatant violation\r\nof the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nof international law. It is also a violation of the rules\r\ngoverning the free flow of international trade.\r\nThe United States embargo against Cuba, which is\r\nbeing steadfastly resisted by the Cuban people, is not an\r\nisolated case in the context of America\u0027s relations with the\r\ninternational community. In 1998, the United States\r\nimposed unilateral sanctions against 75 countries, whose\r\npopulations account for more than half the world\r\npopulation. The United States is the only country that\r\ninsists on the continuation of comprehensive sanctions\r\nagainst Iraq. We know, however, that the resolutions and\r\nsanctions adopted against Iraq have caused enormous\r\ndamage and taken the lives of more than one million Iraqi\r\ncitizens, and destroyed its infrastructure and the social\r\nfabric of its people. We ask the United States to allow\r\njustice, reason and laws to prevail in its policies, to\r\nrespond to the calls of the international community and to\r\nput an end to the embargo decreed against States, and to\r\nrenew dialogue and a policy of cooperation in keeping\r\nwith the rules of international law and the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe call upon all Member States to vote in favour of\r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/54/L.11,\r\nbecause it sends once again a clear message to the United\r\nStates to put an end to this policy of exclusion and\r\nflagrant strategy of blockade.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the next\r\nspeaker, I should like to propose, if there is no objection,\r\nthat the list of speakers in the debate on this item be\r\nclosed immediately.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): I am speaking on behalf\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nSouth Africa would like to take this opportunity once\r\nagain to underline the need to end the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed unilaterally by\r\nthe United States of America on the Republic of Cuba. In\r\nthis respect, we wish to recall the final document adopted\r\nat the Non-Aligned Movement summit held in Durban,\r\nSouth Africa, which expressed “deep concern over the\r\nwidening of, the extraterritorial nature of the embargo\r\nagainst Cuba and over continuous new legislative measures\r\ngeared to intensifying it” (A/53/667, annex I, para. 255).\r\nFurthermore, during this session of the General Assembly,\r\nthe Ministers for Foreign Affairs and heads of delegation of\r\nthe countries of the Non-Aligned Movement called for an\r\nend to this unilateral embargo, which is contrary to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, international law and good\r\nneighbourliness. It has caused huge material losses and\r\neconomic damage to the people of Cuba.\r\nAll signatories to the United Nations Charter have a\r\nduty and responsibility to strictly uphold its vision,\r\nprinciples and obligations. These principles are equally\r\nbinding on all Member States. They reaffirm the equality of\r\nsovereign States and the requirement of non-intervention\r\nand non-interference in their domestic affairs. These\r\nprinciples also include freedom of international trade and\r\nnavigation, both of which are integral parts of many\r\ninternational legal instruments.\r\nFor decades, Cuba has suffered from the unilateral\r\nimposition of this unjust economic embargo, which\r\nconstitutes a violation of the basic norms governing\r\ninternational relations. Furthermore, the embargo continues\r\nto cause untold suffering for its civilian population.\r\nSouth Africa, as well the majority of other Member\r\nStates, continues to oppose the Helms-Burton Act because\r\nof the threat it poses to the sovereignty of other States and\r\nits unilateral and extraterritorial nature, as well as the fact\r\nthat it inhibits the free flow of international trade. In line\r\nwith the United Nations Charter and consistent with\r\nresolution 53/4, among others, the Government of South\r\nAfrica therefore encourages the settlement of this dispute\r\nthrough peaceful negotiation between the parties. In this\r\nrespect, constructive interaction will foster mutual\r\nconfidence and trust as well as engender harmonious\r\ncoexistence between the two nations.\r\nSouth Africa will once again support the draft\r\nresolution under consideration by the General Assembly\r\nunder this agenda item, in document A/54/L.11. We will\r\ndo so because, as President Mbeki stressed in his address\r\nto the General Assembly at the opening of the general\r\ndebate at this session, the time has come for measures to\r\nbe taken to ensure that the principles of the Charter\r\ninform our actions and what happens in the world we all\r\nshare.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nIn almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on\r\nfinancial and commercial issues and related final\r\ndeclarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this\r\nsystem, the critical need for an equitable, secure, non-\r\ndiscriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system\r\nhas been emphasized. The necessity of achieving an\r\ninternational economic and financial environment and an\r\ninvestment climate that are positive and favourable to\r\ndeveloping countries, thereby facilitating an increase in\r\ntheir share of international trade and finance — a\r\ndevelopment necessary for world economic growth,\r\nincluding the creation of productive employment — has\r\nalso been endorsed by consensus year after year. These\r\ninstruments have also requested all countries to abolish all\r\nmeasures which could impede free international trade and\r\nfinancial transactions. In a number of high-level meetings\r\nwithin the United Nations, Member States reaffirmed and\r\nrenewed their commitments to uphold and strengthen the\r\nmultilateral trading system for the economic and social\r\nadvancement of all countries and peoples.\r\nThe promotion of international cooperation and\r\nfriendly relations among States, and the strengthening of\r\ncommitments to the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law,\r\nparticularly sovereign equality, non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of other States and the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes, have also been major objectives of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nDespite the existence of a new international\r\nenvironment which is conducive to strengthening\r\nconstructive dialogue and genuine partnership to promote\r\nfurther economic cooperation for development, recourse\r\nto unilateral coercive economic measures has been on the\r\nrise. Such policies and measures constitute major\r\nimpediments to financial freedom and the access of all\r\ncountries to financial resources, and thereby hamper the\r\neconomic development and expansion of financial\r\nrelations at all levels.\r\nAll countries should refrain from recourse to such\r\nmeasures and actions, which are absolutely contrary to the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nprovisions of the Charter as well as the principles of\r\ninternational law embodied in various international\r\ninstruments and documents, in particular the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on\r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Universal\r\nDeclaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition,\r\nthe Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the\r\nDomestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their\r\nIndependence and Sovereignty and the Declaration on\r\nPrinciples of International Law concerning Friendly\r\nRelations and Cooperation among States. Such measures\r\nand actions adversely affect the social and economic\r\ndevelopment, as well as the humanitarian activities, of a\r\ntarget country, and consequently hinder the full realization\r\nof human rights by the people subjected to these measures;\r\nthus, they should be abolished if they are in place.\r\nIt is an undeniable right of every State to choose its\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural system without\r\ninterference in any form by another State. Since the\r\nultimate objective of these measures is to undermine\r\ninternational peace and security and create political and\r\neconomic instability in other countries, the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran, like other members of the international community,\r\nadvocates the removal and elimination of all economic and\r\ntrade embargoes imposed upon Cuba, and believes that\r\ndifferences between States should be settled in a peaceful\r\nmanner. In this connection the Twelfth Conference of\r\nHeads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, held in South Africa, called upon all\r\nGovernments to abolish the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial measures and actions against Cuba.\r\nCognizant of the economic, social and financial\r\ndifficulties the Cuban nation is facing as a result of the\r\nembargo, my delegation would like to extend its support\r\nonce again to any step that the General Assembly may wish\r\nto take to resolve the issue under consideration through\r\npeaceful means and on the basis of the Declaration on\r\nPrinciples of International Law concerning Friendly\r\nRelations and Cooperation among States in accordance with\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Therefore, my delegation\r\nwill vote in favour of the draft resolution under this agenda\r\nitem.\r\nThe international community should clearly reject the\r\npromulgation and application of unilateral actions, laws and\r\nregulations whose extraterritorial impact adversely affects\r\nthe freedom of trade and finance, the sovereignty or the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial interests of other\r\nStates, or the legitimate interests of entities or persons\r\nunder their jurisdiction.\r\nThe President: We shall now proceed to consider\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.11.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote\r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Korpi (Finland): I have the honour to take the\r\nfloor on behalf of the European Union with reference to\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.11, entitled “Necessity of ending\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. The\r\nCentral and Eastern European countries associated with\r\nthe European Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nHungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and\r\nSlovenia — and the associated countries Cyprus and\r\nMalta, as well as the European Free Trade Association\r\ncountry member of the European Economic Area, Iceland,\r\nalign themselves with this explanation of vote.\r\nLet me refer to the European Union Common\r\nPosition of 2 December 1996, and reiterate on this\r\noccasion that the main objective of the European Union\r\nin its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of\r\ngradual and peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy\r\nand respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nas well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the\r\nliving standards of the Cuban people. The European\r\nUnion recognizes that some positive developments took\r\nplace in 1998, but it continues to be concerned about the\r\npolitical and economic situation in Cuba, and expresses its\r\nhope for durable and substantive improvements.\r\nMore recently, the Cuban social, political and\r\neconomic situation has seen very little change, and the\r\nhuman rights situation has seen no change at all. The\r\npositive development of human rights after the visit of the\r\nPope has not continued. For example, four leading Cuban\r\ndissidents were condemned in a closed juridical procedure\r\nto imprisonment. The international community reacted\r\nstrongly against that act as a violation of freedom of\r\nexpression. The European Union is concerned about some\r\naspects of the law adopted on 16 February 1999 by the\r\nNational Assembly penalizing the exercise of the right of\r\ncitizens to express opinions and to disseminate\r\ninformation.\r\nThe European Union emphasizes the fundamental\r\nresponsibility of the Cuban authorities regarding human\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nrights such as freedom of thought, opinion, expression,\r\nassembly and association, and rights associated with the\r\nadministration of justice, and in this connection urges them\r\nto liberate and fully reintegrate into society all prisoners of\r\nconscience. We appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate\r\nfully with international human rights bodies and\r\nmechanisms.\r\nCuba has been very active in various international and\r\nregional forums. The European Union welcomes its\r\nparticipation in the summit between States of the Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean and the European Union that\r\nwas held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1999.\r\nThe European Union acknowledges that steps towards\r\nbetter economic integration have been taken by the Cuban\r\nGovernment and stresses the need for a progressive and\r\nirreversible opening of the Cuban economy. The European\r\nUnion reiterates its wish to be Cuba\u0027s partner in such a\r\nprocess. However, its full cooperation with Cuba will\r\ndepend upon improvement in human rights and in political\r\nfreedom.\r\nAs expressed in the European Union Common Position\r\nof 2 December 1996, it is not our policy to bring about\r\nchange by coercive measures with the effect of increasing\r\nthe economic hardship of the Cuban people.\r\nThe European Union believes that United States trade\r\npolicy towards Cuba is primarily a matter for those two\r\nGovernments. But the European Union has made clear its\r\nopposition to the extraterritorial extension of the United\r\nStates embargo, such as that contained in the so-called\r\nCuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-Burton Act\r\nof 1996.\r\nFurthermore, we wish to reaffirm that the European\r\nUnion\u0027s strong opposition, both in law and in principle, to\r\nthe imposition of secondary boycotts and to legislation with\r\nextraterritorial and retroactive effects remains unchanged.\r\nIn November 1996 the Council of Ministers of the\r\nEuropean Union adopted a regulation and a joint action to\r\nprotect the interests of natural or legal persons resident in\r\nthe European Union against the extraterritorial effects of the\r\nHelms-Burton legislation; these prohibit compliance with\r\nthat legislation.\r\nOn 18 May 1998, at the European Union/United States\r\nsummit in London, a package was agreed with regard to\r\nUnited States sanctions laws, including a commitment by\r\nthe United States Administration to resist future\r\nextraterritorial legislation of this kind and an\r\nunderstanding with respect to disciplines for the\r\nstrengthening of investment protection.\r\nThe European Union takes the view that this\r\nrepresents an important step forward towards resolving\r\nthe outstanding questions with the United States on this\r\nmatter. We emphasize, however, that the European\r\nUnion\u0027s commitment to implementing the package must\r\nbe matched by the United States side. We look forward\r\nto progress in this area.\r\nFor all these reasons, the States of the European\r\nUnion will unanimously support the draft resolution\r\nbefore us today.\r\nMr. Burleigh (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States opposes this ill-advised draft resolution and\r\nencourages all other delegations to do likewise. The\r\ndecision of the United States to maintain a trade embargo\r\nagainst the Government of Cuba is strictly a matter of\r\nbilateral trade policy and not a matter appropriate for\r\nconsideration in or by the General Assembly. The\r\ncontention, implicit in the draft resolution, that the United\r\nStates forbids others from trading with Cuba is simply\r\nwrong. Sovereign States themselves decide with which\r\nother States they will trade. Because of the repressive\r\npolicies and actions of the Castro Government itself, the\r\nUnited States chooses not to trade with the Cuban\r\nGovernment.\r\nThe United States imposed and maintains a bilateral\r\neconomic trade embargo as one element of a policy of\r\npromoting democracy in Cuba. While maintaining the\r\nbilateral trade embargo, the Clinton Administration has\r\nmoved to expand dramatically people-to-people contacts\r\nwith the Cuban population, to increase remittances and to\r\nallow the sale of food and agricultural inputs to private\r\nentities. The American people have been extremely\r\ngenerous in providing humanitarian assistance to Cuba.\r\nThe goal of this policy is to foster a transition to a\r\ndemocratic form of government, to protect human rights,\r\nto permit a civil society to thrive and to provide for the\r\neconomic prosperity that the Cuban Government\u0027s\r\ndisastrous economic polices are denying the Cuban\r\npeople.\r\nThe authorities of the Castro Government believe\r\nthat the human rights of the Cuban people — or, rather,\r\nthe lack thereof — are a concern for them alone. My\r\nGovernment disagrees. Our fundamental premise, based\r\non the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is that\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nhuman rights violations in any one State are of concern to\r\nthe entire international community.\r\nThe focus of the international community, as\r\nmanifested in the United Nations, should be on the\r\ncontinuing human rights crisis in Cuba rather than on\r\nbilateral aspects of the United States efforts to facilitate a\r\npeaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. The draft\r\nresolution under consideration serves only to distract the\r\nattention of the international community and, worse, may\r\nencourage the Cuban authorities to persist in their tragically\r\nmisguided policies.\r\nMr. Sychov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus will support the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the United\r\nStates of America against Cuba”, document A/54/L.11.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus does not agree with the\r\nadoption of any unilateral extraterritorial measures of a\r\ncoercive nature, which run counter to the norms of\r\ninternational law and the provisions of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, which authorize the Security Council alone\r\nto act in regard to the imposition of sanctions. These\r\nmeasures run counter to the generally recognized principles\r\nof the sovereign equality of States and non-interference in\r\ntheir internal affairs.\r\nWe call upon States Members to take further steps to\r\neliminate discriminatory trade practices and to halt the\r\nunilateral economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nexplanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.11.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria,\r\nAzerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados,\r\nBelarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia,\r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria,\r\nBurkina Faso, Cambodia, Canada, Cape Verde, Chad,\r\nChile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo,\r\nCosta Rica, Côte d\u0027Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus,\r\nCzech Republic, Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic,\r\nEcuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia,\r\nFiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany,\r\nGhana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary,\r\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of),\r\nIreland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan,\r\nKenya, Kuwait, Lao People\u0027s Democratic Republic,\r\nLebanon, Lesotho, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar,\r\nMalawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritius,\r\nMexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Mozambique,\r\nMyanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands,\r\nNew Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama,\r\nPapua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines,\r\nPoland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic\r\nof Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Rwanda,\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Samoa, San\r\nMarino, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa,\r\nSpain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland,\r\nSweden, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand,\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo,\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey,\r\nTurkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab\r\nEmirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania,\r\nUruguay, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia,\r\nZimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, United States of America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nEstonia, Georgia, Latvia, Micronesia (Federated\r\nStates of), Morocco, Nicaragua, Senegal, Uzbekistan\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.11 was adopted by 155 votes\r\nto 2, with 8 abstentions (resolution 54/21).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Cameroon, Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines and Saudi Arabia\r\ninformed the Secretariat that they had intended to\r\nvote in favour.]\r\nThe President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in explanation of vote\r\non the resolution just adopted. May I remind delegations\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): Japan shares the concern\r\nexpressed by many delegations today regarding the problem\r\nof extraterritorial application of jurisdiction, such as that\r\narising from the Helms-Burton Act of the United States.\r\nMy Government has been closely following the\r\nimplementation of the legislation and the circumstances\r\nsurrounding it, and Japan\u0027s concerns remain unchanged.\r\nThus, having considered the matter with utmost care, my\r\ndelegation voted in favour of draft resolution A/54/L.11.\r\nWhile Japan supports the draft resolution, we continue\r\nto believe that it might be worth considering whether the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly is in fact the most\r\nsuitable forum in which to address this very complex issue.\r\nAs regards the economic embargo by the United States\r\nagainst Cuba, Japan believes that it is appropriate for both\r\ncountries to seek a solution through bilateral dialogue and\r\nthus calls upon them to strengthen efforts towards that end.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to refer to the\r\nhuman rights situation in Cuba. My Government welcomes\r\nthe visit of the Special Rapporteur on violence against\r\nwomen, appointed by the Commission on Human Rights,\r\nwho reported that many positive measures to improve the\r\nstatus of women have been taken by the Cuban\r\nGovernment. However, Japan remains concerned at the\r\ncurrent human rights situation in Cuba and continues to\r\nhope that it will be improved.\r\nMr. Duval (Canada) (spoke in French): Canada shares\r\nwith the United States the goal of encouraging democracy\r\nand liberalization in Cuba. However, we have been seeking\r\nthis goal through different means. The Government of\r\nCanada continues to believe that a policy of constructive\r\nengagement has much more chance of having a beneficial\r\neffect on Cuba in the long run.\r\nCanada is fundamentally opposed to the economic\r\nembargo, and we voted in favour of draft resolution\r\nA/54/L.11, calling for an end to sanctions. This 40-year\r\nembargo\u0027s effectiveness in achieving its objectives and\r\nencouraging the liberalization of Cuba has been negligible.\r\nCanada welcomes with satisfaction the nascent signs\r\nof greater openness and greater flexibility on the part of the\r\nUnited States, in particular the announcement of additional\r\nperson-to-person contacts between the two countries. We\r\nhave long advocated such constructive engagement.\r\nCanada reaffirms its position that the United States\r\nis not solely responsible for Cuba\u0027s difficulties. Last year,\r\nfor example, there was no alleviation of the Cuban State\u0027s\r\nsystematic repression of its citizens\u0027 rights of freedom of\r\nexpression, freedom of assembly and freedom of\r\nmovement.\r\nCanada will continue to practise a policy of\r\nopenness and frankness in its dialogue with Cuba, and it\r\nmaintains its opposition to the economic embargo of\r\nCuba, with its humanitarian consequences for the people\r\nof Cuba.\r\nMr. Suh (Republic of Korea): My delegation shares\r\nthe concern already expressed by other delegations about\r\nthe problem of the extraterritorial application of\r\njurisdiction embodied in the so-called Helms-Burton Act.\r\nSuch legislation has far-reaching implications for the\r\nnorms and general principles of international law.\r\nHaving considered this matter for several years, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea decided to vote in\r\nfavour of draft resolution A/54/L.11. This decision should\r\nnot be interpreted to mean that we are no longer\r\nconcerned about democracy and human rights in Cuba.\r\nWe hope that progress will be made in this regard in the\r\nnear future.\r\nMr. Pérez-Otermin (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe Uruguayan delegation would like to explain its vote\r\non the resolution just adopted by the General Assembly,\r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial\r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba”.\r\nThe Uruguayan delegation voted in favour of this\r\nresolution on the basis of one of the essential and\r\ntraditional principles of its foreign policy — promoting\r\nfree trade without any restrictions — and also on the\r\nbasis of the fact that Uruguay\u0027s laws do not recognize the\r\nextraterritorial application of internal laws. We regard acts\r\nof this sort as a clear violation of national sovereignty,\r\nwhich is a basic principle of international law, and also as\r\na violation of the Charter of this Organization.\r\nUruguay does not see this as the appropriate way to\r\nachieve democratic openness in Cuba. Uruguay will\r\ntherefore continue to take any steps that, in its opinion,\r\nmay facilitate this desired openness and promote the full\r\nenjoyment of the freedoms and rights of a democratic\r\nregime.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nMr. Moura (Brazil): As in previous years, the\r\ndelegation of Brazil voted in favour of the resolution on\r\nthis subject that has just been adopted. In our opinion, the\r\nsettlement of disputes between States must be sought\r\nthrough peaceful means. Any forceful measures, such as\r\nsanctions or embargoes, are exceptions to this general rule.\r\nSuch measures should be resorted to only when all other\r\nmeans have been exhausted, and in any case they must be\r\nfirmly based on international law.\r\nBrazil reiterates its position that discriminatory trade\r\npractices and the extraterritorial application of domestic law\r\nrun counter to the need to promote dialogue and to ensure\r\nthe prevalence of the purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. Sanctions and embargoes that\r\ncontradict international law increase tensions. If they affect\r\nthe interests of third States, as they do in this case, the\r\ninternational community has even more reason for concern.\r\nBesides being rejected by the General Assembly, the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by\r\nthe United States of America has been rejected in a number\r\nof other international forums, such as the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, the Rio Group, the Ibero-American\r\nSummit and the Latin American Economic System. The\r\nembargo is also not in accordance with the legal obligations\r\nof the members of the World Trade Organization.\r\nBrazil joins the near-unanimity of the international\r\ncommunity in rejecting these unilateral measures.\r\nMs. Zhang Xiao\u0027an (China) (spoke in Chinese): The\r\nChinese delegation voted in favour of the resolution that\r\nhas just been adopted.\r\nOver the years the United Nations has adopted many\r\nresolutions urging all States to observe the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the norms of international law and to\r\navoid implementing laws and measures that endanger third\r\nStates\u0027 legitimate rights and interests. However, regrettably,\r\nthe United States Government has not responded to the\r\ninternational community\u0027s calls. It has refused to implement\r\nthe relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.\r\nThe continuing sanctions and embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States Government have posed great difficulties for\r\nthe Cuban people in their endeavour to achieve economic\r\nand social development and reform, thus seriously\r\nconstraining the Cuban Government\u0027s efforts to eradicate\r\npoverty and enhance its people\u0027s living standards. Cuban\r\nwomen and children have borne the brunt of the suffering,\r\nespecially in terms of their health and welfare.\r\nThe United States embargo against Cuba violates the\r\nhuman rights of the peoples of other States, and its\r\nunilateral actions have also hindered Cuba\u0027s engagement\r\nin normal trade and economic contacts with many other\r\ncountries, thereby seriously encroaching upon Cuba\u0027s\r\nlegitimate rights and interests.\r\nThis kind of phenomenon should not be allowed to\r\npersist. History tells us that only on the basis of mutual\r\nrespect for other States\u0027 choices and through dialogue and\r\nnegotiation on an equal footing can differences between\r\nStates be effectively resolved. We hope that the United\r\nStates Government will take constructive actions that are\r\nin keeping with the times.\r\nMr. Brattskar (Norway): The Norwegian\r\nGovernment believes there is a clear distinction between\r\nunilateral measures and sanctions adopted by the\r\ninternational community through the United Nations. Only\r\nsanctions adopted by the international community through\r\nrelevant and representative organizations have the\r\nnecessary legitimacy, and no country should impose its\r\nlegislation on third countries.\r\nTherefore, Norway again this year voted in favour of\r\nthe draft resolution entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by\r\nthe United States of America against Cuba”, contained in\r\ndocument A/54/L.11. This does not in any way mean that\r\nNorway condones violations of human rights in Cuba. We\r\ndo not, however, consider isolation through unilateral\r\nmeasures, such as the embargo under discussion, to be an\r\nappropriate response to the situation and developments in\r\nCuba.\r\nNorway believes that more can be achieved through\r\na constructive dialogue from which no theme should be\r\nexcluded. We are at present engaged in such a\r\nconstructive and open dialogue with Cuban authorities, a\r\ndialogue that focuses on human rights.\r\nMr. Blumenthal (Australia): Australia voted in\r\nfavour of resolution 54/21. While Australia shares\r\nconcerns about the state of human rights and political\r\nfreedoms in Cuba, we do not consider that isolating Cuba\r\nthrough economic sanctions is an effective means of\r\nachieving human rights and political reform. Australia has\r\nconsistently expressed its opposition, as a matter of\r\nprinciple, to the promulgation and application by States\r\nMembers of the United Nations of laws and measures\r\nwhose extraterritorial effects affect the sovereignty of\r\nother\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 9 November 1999\r\nStates, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under\r\ntheir jurisdiction, as well as the freedom of trade and\r\nnavigation. In Australia\u0027s view, such laws and measures are\r\nnot justified by the principles of international law and\r\ncomity. Australia is concerned about the unilateral\r\nextraterritorial aspects of the Helms-Burton Act, which\r\ncodifies and broadens the embargo by targeting foreign\r\ninvestors in Cuba.\r\nFor these reasons, Australia has again voted in favour\r\nof the resolution submitted under this item.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of the\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 22?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n22\r\n"
