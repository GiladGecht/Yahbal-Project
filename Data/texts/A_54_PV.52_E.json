(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 165\r\nCommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child\r\nThe President: This morning the General Assembly,\r\nin accordance with the decisions taken at its 3rd plenary\r\nmeeting on 17 September and its 33rd plenary meeting on\r\n11 October 1999, is holding, under agenda item 165, the\r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child.\r\nWhen I spoke at the opening of this fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly in September, I described\r\nsome major challenges that face us on the eve of the new\r\nmillennium. Uppermost in my mind then, as today, was the\r\nplight of many millions of children in the world who\r\ncontinue to die of preventable causes; who are victimized\r\nby drugs, crime and sexual abuse; who continue to face a\r\nfuture of hunger, poverty and illiteracy; who are subjected\r\nto hazardous and exploitative work; who are targets of\r\nviolence or victims of neglect; and, above all, who continue\r\nto be used as child soldiers to fight the bloody and\r\ndestructive wars of adults.\r\nWith all this in mind, I am particularly pleased to\r\ndeliver this statement today on the occasion of the\r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the adoption by\r\nthe General Assembly of the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child.\r\nThere are, I am told, over 2 billion children in the\r\nworld today: 2 billion precious fruit trees and beautiful\r\nflowers of the human family — our souls. Their\r\nprotection and development are crucial to the future\r\nsurvival of humanity. We must not fail our children,\r\nbecause the consequences are unthinkable. What happens\r\nto children in their early years determines, for better or\r\nfor worse, their growth and their place in society. This, in\r\nturn, has influence on their role and character; we are\r\nparents, and we know this. That is why so much of the\r\nfuture depends upon the rewarding opportunities and care\r\nthat we provide for our children when they are young.\r\nThey need special and priority attention for a variety of\r\ncompelling reasons — moral, social and economic, as\r\nwell as cultural.\r\nSince the adoption of the Convention, children\u0027s\r\ninterests are now placed higher on public and\r\ndevelopmental agendas than ever before, and significant\r\nrecognition of their rights is reflected in the initiatives\r\nthat United Nations Member States undertake in fields\r\nsuch as public policy, law reform and enforcement and\r\nsocial security. At the same time, however, the process of\r\nglobalization has sharply widened the economic and\r\nsocial gap between and within States, with women and\r\nchildren in the Third World being placed in a precarious\r\nposition at the receiving end.\r\nMost countries in the developing world are plagued\r\nby major economic problems, with bleak prospects for\r\ngrowth that complicate any prospects for fully realizing\r\nthe rights of children. The worldwide external debt burden\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nrepresents yet another major obstacle to social progress and\r\ncaring for children. A child in the developing world is born\r\nwith debt baggage averaging $417. Sub-Saharan Africa\r\nspends more on servicing its debt of over $200 billion than\r\non the health and education of its many hundreds of\r\nmillions of children. There is more: because of her gender,\r\nthe girl child in particular suffers discrimination and abuse\r\nfor a great part of her life. Moreover, the girl child faces\r\ndeep traditional prejudices and is denied opportunities for\r\nequality, education, nutrition, health care and, often,\r\nsurvival itself. It is therefore important to take account of\r\nthe special needs of the girl child.\r\nThe 1995 Beijing Platform for Action adopted a\r\nspecific critical criterion of concern with regard to the girl\r\nchild and agreed to the life-cycle approach that should be\r\nincluded in all programmes and policies aimed at benefiting\r\nthe girl child. Because of gender discrimination and\r\nunceasing violence, millions of girls, like their mothers and\r\nsisters before them, continue to be denied their basic rights,\r\nwhich means they lose out on opportunities to participate\r\nfully as adults in the political, economic and social life of\r\ntheir countries — namely, power, wealth and access.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a global menace of almost\r\nunimaginable proportions; yet it is a killer monster to which\r\nthe global community is still failing to provide the kind of\r\nconcerted response that is so urgently needed. HIV/AIDS\r\nis a non-discriminatory enemy of humanity that respects no\r\nborders.\r\nThe scourge of war, with children and women as the\r\nprimary victims, continues to threaten decades of political,\r\neconomic and social gains, especially in Africa, driving\r\nmillions away from their homes and countries, while\r\nsubjecting many innocent children to unspeakable brutality.\r\nOn 25 August 1999, during the Namibian presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council, I presided over an open debate on\r\nchildren and armed conflict. At the end of that debate, the\r\nCouncil adopted its first-ever resolution on the plight of\r\nchildren in armed conflict, resolution 1261 (1999), and\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to report back in 2000 on\r\nits implementation.\r\nThe Security Council, inter alia,\r\n“Strongly condemn[ed] the targeting of children\r\nin situations of armed conflict, including killing and\r\nmaiming, sexual violence, abduction and forced\r\ndisplacement, recruitment and use of children in\r\narmed conflict in violation of international law, ... and\r\ncall[ed] on all parties concerned to put an end to such\r\npractices”. (Security Council resolution 1261 (1999),\r\npara. 2)\r\nI believe that the General Assembly, as well as the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and other key bodies in the\r\nUnited Nations system, should follow suit and do even\r\nmore. The General Assembly, for its part, must lead this\r\ncrusade by example.\r\nBut such condemnation, though laudable, is not\r\nenough. Ugly and painful abuses continue today in many\r\ncountries in the world that are currently engulfed in\r\narmed conflicts. It is for this reason that I call upon\r\ndelegations present here to demonstrate their support for\r\nthe peace and security agenda for children that was\r\nlaunched in February this year by the United Nations\r\nChildren\u0027s Fund (UNICEF). The Executive Director of\r\nUNICEF, Ms. Carol Bellamy, is a hard-working\r\nchampion of the rights and welfare of children. She can\r\nalways count on my cooperation and support. We are all\r\nin this together, because we are saving our own lives.\r\nIn the same vein, the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict,\r\nAmbassador Olara Otunnu, has proposed practical\r\nmeasures to prevent or mitigate the suffering of children\r\nwho are caught up in conflicts in many parts of the\r\nworld. I encourage him to continue with his worldwide\r\ncampaign on behalf of our children, the leaders of the\r\ntwenty-first century and beyond.\r\nThe years 2001 to 2010 have been proclaimed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the International Decade for a\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of the\r\nWorld. We must translate that lofty declaration of intent\r\ninto a viable plan of action, buttressing it with generous\r\nfunds and resources and with unwavering commitment by\r\nthe entire international community.\r\nI want to seize this opportunity once again to call\r\nupon the General Assembly at this and all future sessions\r\nto ensure that the rights and well-being of our children\r\nare an ever-present responsibility all year round and that\r\nthey are put on the front burner for action. I can hardly\r\nthink of any better way for the General Assembly to fulfil\r\nthe Charter\u0027s vision of a peaceful, just and prosperous\r\nworld, and the Convention\u0027s promise of a better future for\r\nevery child.\r\nI call on the Deputy Secretary-General.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: Today we have\r\ncause to rejoice, and I am happy to be here with the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly to celebrate. In a few\r\ndays, the Convention on the Rights of the Child will be 10\r\nyears old — a child itself, really. It has already become the\r\nmost widely ratified human rights instrument.\r\nThis is a wonderful victory. All children are now\r\nrecognized by a near-universal, legally binding instrument\r\nas individuals with special needs, who are entitled to\r\nspecial protection. Maybe more important, they are\r\nrecognized as individuals with dignity, who have the rights\r\nof full human beings. To many of us, this may seem almost\r\ntoo obvious for words, but it took until the last decade of\r\nthe twentieth century to turn that recognition into an\r\ninternational Convention which spells out, for example, a\r\nchild\u0027s right to be free from economic and sexual\r\nexploitation, to receive an education and to have access to\r\nhealth care. Redefining needs as rights is not merely a\r\nquestion of terminology. A right is something you can\r\nactually claim.\r\nTo achieve truly universal ratification of the\r\nConvention would be a fitting way to enter the new\r\ncentury, a century that will belong to the children of today.\r\nIt is a concern to us all that the United States is one of the\r\nonly two countries that have not yet ratified this pillar of\r\nhuman rights law, and I should like to take this opportunity\r\nto urge it to do so as soon as possible.\r\nThe ratification of the Convention by so many\r\ncountries means that its principles are becoming part of\r\nnational law everywhere, from Viet Nam to Tunisia, and\r\nfrom Portugal to Colombia. Countries are making school\r\nattendance compulsory, strengthening laws on child\r\nprostitution and pornography, adopting a minimum working\r\nage and affording immigrant and refugee children better\r\nprotection against discrimination. In several States the\r\nConvention has been a factor in deciding court cases\r\ninvolving children.\r\nThe Convention has also inspired and guided the\r\nfurther strengthening of international standards on children\u0027s\r\nrights. Last June we all welcomed the adoption of the new\r\nInternational Labour Organization Convention No. 182 on\r\nthe Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination\r\nof the Worst Forms of Child Labour — forms of child\r\nlabour which include debt bondage, the forced recruitment\r\nof children soldiers, child prostitution and the use of\r\nchildren for illegal activities.\r\nIn addition, efforts are under way to strengthen the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child itself through two\r\noptional protocols, on the involvement of children in\r\narmed conflict and on the sexual exploitation of children.\r\nI urge all Governments to support these efforts as a\r\nfurther step towards ending some of the most shocking\r\nand shameful violations of children\u0027s rights.\r\nHowever, we shall not be judged as a world\r\ncommunity by what we say we should or will do, but by\r\nwhat we actually do. In practice, there remain colossal\r\nobstacles to the universal protection of children\u0027s rights.\r\nAnd this is no wonder, since of all the difficult issues we\r\ndeal with at the United Nations I cannot think of one, old\r\nor new, that does not have a child\u0027s face.\r\nThe greatest single enemy of children\u0027s rights is\r\npoverty. By keeping millions of children, especially girls,\r\nout of school, it denies them their right to primary\r\neducation. By putting huge numbers to work, often in\r\nexploitative or harmful conditions, it denies them their\r\nright to rest and play, as well as their right to good health\r\nand well-being. By leaving many to fend for themselves\r\non the streets, it deprives them of the right to be brought\r\nup by their families. And as malnutrition kills thousands\r\nevery day, it even deprives them of their right to live.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIf we really believe in the rights of children, we\r\nshould fight with all our strength against poverty and for\r\nsocial development. If we really believe in the rights of\r\nchildren, we should prevent or settle as soon as we can\r\nthe armed conflicts that make seven-year-old children into\r\nsoldiers, that maim them, that orphan them, that make\r\nthem refugees. We must exterminate the AIDS epidemic,\r\nwhich condemns newborns to death or to a pariah life,\r\nand which makes young adolescents into the heads of\r\nlarge families. We must eradicate drug trafficking and\r\nassure that the Internet does not facilitate the distribution\r\nof child pornography. We must stigmatize sexual tourism.\r\nThis disturbing list shows clearly that children\u0027s\r\nrights are not some abstraction. The absence of respect\r\nfor them is a real tragedy, experienced day in and day out\r\nby the most vulnerable among us. For this reason, if we\r\nare to make the rights of children a reality, we must act\r\nin a wide range of fields. In other words, all the rights of\r\nthe child are so intimately interlinked and so closely\r\nassociated with peace and development that if we succeed\r\nin guaranteeing respect for all the rights of all children\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\neverywhere, we will have radically changed the world for\r\nall human beings, of whatever age.\r\nHighlighting the rights of children, therefore,\r\nnecessarily means attacking the root causes of a whole set\r\nof problems that lie at the heart of the mission of the\r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations Population Fund, the\r\nInternational Labour Organization, the World Health\r\nOrganization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and of course\r\nUnited Nations Children\u0027s Fund — almost all the United\r\nNations agencies have a role to play. Today in\r\npeacekeeping operations and in humanitarian missions, the\r\nfate of children is officially a high priority. In the context\r\nof its thematic debates, the Security Council has focused on\r\nthe situation of children. As for the Secretary-General, he\r\ntook a decisive step when he excluded children under the\r\nage of 18 from participation in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nNonetheless, these efforts are meaningless unless\r\nGovernments and civil society take up the challenge. At all\r\nthe major conferences of the nineties, the rights of children\r\nhave been taken into account and have been reflected in the\r\ncommitments made. I invite the Governments of all\r\nMember States to remain faithful to those commitments and\r\nto keep the situation of children very much in mind during\r\nfollow-up conferences and the Millennium Summit. If\r\nGovernments continue to integrate the provisions of the\r\nDeclaration of the Rights of the Child into their national\r\nlegislation, if they disseminate those provisions as widely\r\nas possible and, above all, if they really put into practice\r\nthe great principles of the right to life and to development,\r\nof non-discrimination and of the primacy of children\u0027s\r\ninterests, then States will have fulfilled their obligations.\r\nBut obviously the Convention is not just an\r\ninternational treaty binding the States that have signed it.\r\nRather, it is a universal instrument that has permeated the\r\ncollective consciousness and become the symbol of a world\r\nmovement in favour of social progress. Whether in respect\r\nof tourism, the Internet, pharmaceuticals or sporting goods\r\nmanufacturers, a new awareness and a sense of\r\nresponsibility are leading today to concrete initiatives that\r\nare transforming the lives of millions of children. Whatever\r\nthe price, this movement must continue; even more, it must\r\ngrow, because children\u0027s rights are the business of\r\neveryone, of every family, every group, every school and\r\nevery company, every State and every society.\r\nThe succeeding generations mentioned in the Charter\r\nare not only those in the distant future. The first are\r\nalready among us — the children of today — and it is\r\ntoday, therefore, that we must start protecting them, not\r\nonly from the scourge of warfare, but also from all\r\nviolations of their fundamental rights as recognized in the\r\nDeclaration and by its 191 signatories.\r\nThe President: I thank the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral for her statement.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): I am\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nTen years ago, breaking with a shameful inaction\r\nvis-à-vis the children of the world, especially the\r\nhundreds of millions among them left to their own\r\ndevices, with neither rights nor protection, robbed of their\r\nchildhood and condemned to hopelessness, the\r\ninternational community finally adopted a Convention\r\ngranting children specific rights and recognizing their\r\nplace and role in society.\r\nThis celebration, beyond its commemorative aspect,\r\nreminds us once again of the gravity and growing urgency\r\nof the continuing, unacceptable fate of this vulnerable,\r\nneglected part of humanity.\r\nDespite the progress made, the reality remains bleak\r\nand the prospects scarcely something to celebrate. Judge\r\nfor yourselves: in this decade alone, more than 2 million\r\nchildren have been killed and millions of others wounded,\r\nmutilated, raped or disabled for life; 10 million have been\r\nseriously traumatized and will suffer the after-effects for\r\nthe rest of their lives; 12 million, having lost their homes,\r\nare left to fend for themselves; 300,000 serve as cannon\r\nfodder in conflicts of which they understand neither the\r\nstakes nor causes; 800 children a year are killed or\r\nmutilated by anti-personnel and other land mines.\r\nFurthermore, 12 million children under the age of\r\nfive die each year of preventable diseases; 250 million\r\nchildren work to the point of exhaustion in clandestine\r\nsweatshops to bring home to needy families the meagre\r\nearnings of their labour and suffering; 130 million school-\r\nage children cannot attend school, while another 150\r\nmillion are forced to quit by the fifth year of schooling.\r\nFinally, tens of millions of children are victims of\r\nmalnutrition and famine and survive only to die because\r\nof war, violence, illness or society\u0027s neglect.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nTo what future can these children aspire, victims of\r\nwar, hunger, lack of care and of love, orphans raised in\r\nrefugee camps or in the violence of the streets, robbed of\r\ntheir innocence and deprived of their dreams, whose only\r\nmemories of their stolen childhood will be scenes of\r\natrocity, rape, promiscuity and poverty and who have no\r\nchoice but to fight while other children their age have fun\r\nand play the simple games of childhood?\r\nFaced with the tragedy experienced daily by tens of\r\nmillions of children, many of whom are African, caught\r\nbetween the horrors of war and the immense cruelty of life,\r\nthe United Nations has responsibilities to assume and a role\r\nto play.\r\nIf it is true that the international community has not\r\nremained completely inactive, as shown by its numerous\r\nactions taken over a number of years, it is no less true that\r\nthese actions remain pathetically inadequate in the light of\r\nthe gravity and urgency of the situation. From this point of\r\nview, the almost universal adoption and ratification of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, for all those States\r\nor governmental and non-governmental organizations that\r\nhave made protection of children their creed and their\r\nbattle, is a major accomplishment that will be supported,\r\nconsolidated and reinforced by the two optional protocols\r\ncurrently being worked out.\r\nFrom this same point of view, we welcome the\r\nunanimous adoption at the eighty-seventh International\r\nLabour Conference of the International Labour Organization\r\nConvention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which\r\ncrowns the long struggle of all those who with\r\ndetermination and courage have undertaken to ban for ever\r\nthis new form of slavery, all the more deplorable because\r\nit involves children.\r\nSimilarly, we welcome the remarkable and dedicated\r\nwork of the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund in favour of\r\nthe world\u0027s children. We also deeply appreciate the tireless\r\nwork of Mr. Olara Otunnu, Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict in\r\nalerting the international community to the urgent need for\r\nvigorous action to protect children from the consequences\r\nof our errant adult ways.\r\nIn this regard, I have the pleasure of underscoring the\r\ncontribution of Africa to this universal movement in favour\r\nof the child and to recall here that Africa, where\r\ntraditionally the child has a central place in the family and\r\nin society, has been a part of this movement, or served as\r\nthe inspiration for it.\r\nIndeed, very early on our continent took it upon\r\nitself to protect children and to provide them the\r\nconditions necessary for their development. Thus, in 1979\r\nthe member States of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) adopted in Monrovia the Declaration on the\r\nRights and Well-being of the Child, and this was followed\r\nsome 10 years later by the African Charter on the Rights\r\nand Welfare of the Child, which forbids the recruitment\r\nof children under 18 years of age and which in its\r\npreamble recognizes that\r\n“the child, due to the needs of his physical and\r\nmental development, requires particular care with\r\nregard to health, physical, mental, moral and social\r\ndevelopment, and requires legal protection in\r\nconditions of freedom, dignity and security”.\r\nI am pleased to announce that this Charter will enter\r\ninto force next 28 November and that the next OAU\r\nsummit, which will be held in Lomé, will undertake to\r\nestablish a committee for the implementation of this\r\nimportant instrument. This will give new impetus to\r\ncollective action in Africa in favour of the child.\r\nIn 1996 Africa\u0027s commitment to children was\r\nadvanced with the same determination when the summit\r\nat Yaoundé adopted a resolution affirming that the use of\r\nchildren in armed conflicts was a violation of their rights\r\nand must be considered a war crime. Therefore it was\r\nlogical that at the thirty-fifty Assembly of Heads of State\r\nand Government, held in Algiers in July 1999, Africa\r\nconfirmed its firm and irreversible commitment to\r\nchildren. This was done through the adoption of several\r\nmajor decisions that it seems fitting and useful to briefly\r\nrecall to this Assembly.\r\nIn its decision related to the ratification of the\r\nAfrican Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child,\r\nthe Assembly launched an urgent appeal to States that had\r\nnot yet signed or ratified the Charter to do so, and it\r\nfurther invited member States to work together with the\r\nUnited Nations Children\u0027s Fund and the secretariat of the\r\nOAU, within the framework of a protocol agreement, to\r\naccelerate the implementation of the instrument.\r\nThe work of the African conference on the use of\r\nchild soldiers, held in Maputo last 19 to 22 April, was\r\ncrowned by the adoption of a declaration which\r\ncondemned the recruitment of children into the military\r\nand called for raising the minimum age for recruitment —\r\nand even voluntary enlistment — to 18 years. The Algiers\r\nAssembly adopted a decision concerning that conference\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nin which it praised its positive results; recommended the\r\nestablishment of a special committee on the situation of\r\nchildren in armed conflicts; urged the member States to\r\nadopt and promote norms prohibiting the recruitment and\r\nuse of child soldiers under 18 years of age; and invited the\r\nSecretary-General of the OAU to set up the appropriate\r\nmechanisms for combating this phenomenon with a view to\r\ndrafting an international convention in this regard.\r\nFinally, the Assembly appealed to all the member\r\nStates and to the international community to lend their\r\nsupport to the psycho-social rehabilitation of children\r\naffected by the proliferation and circulation of and illicit\r\ntrafficking in light weapons.\r\nIn sum, in calling for respect for the relevant\r\ninternational and regional instruments, in taking the\r\nnecessary steps to prohibit the military recruitment of\r\nchildren under 18 years of age, and in adopting measures\r\nagainst the proliferation of and illicit trafficking in light\r\nweapons, the Assembly in Algiers showed the seriousness\r\nwith which Africa is dealing with this problem. And, in so\r\ndoing, the summit showed the way for the rest of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nHowever, the work to be done is immense, and it is\r\nclear that Africa alone cannot resolve the problem of\r\nchildren affected by conflicts nor assume its obligations as\r\nregards child victims of underdevelopment, disease and\r\ndestitution. Certainly Africa today has the political will. It\r\nhas decided to make the coming year the year of peace and\r\nstability in Africa. For some months now it has been\r\ncourageously and vigorously engaged in curbing conflicts\r\nthat are tearing apart the continent and exhausting its\r\nenergy. But it is clear above all that Africa lacks the\r\ncapacity to succeed in these efforts on its own, without an\r\neffective mobilization of the international community and\r\nwithout the international community\u0027s firm support for\r\nAfrica\u0027s efforts to resolve the conflicts, consolidate peace\r\nand stability throughout the continent, and reconstruct the\r\neconomies damaged by the conflicts. Nor can Africa be\r\nsuccessful as long as the lucrative arms business continues,\r\nas long as the resources of the continent continue to be\r\npillaged, as long as sanctions imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil or the OAU continue to be violated, and as long as\r\nthe international financial institutions and private investors\r\ncontinue their stinginess vis-à-vis Africa.\r\nFinally we are seeing a healthy awareness which has\r\nstripped away the heavy coating of indifference to the\r\nunjust fate of children and which has truly galvanized the\r\nenergies of all those who neither can nor wish to simply\r\naccept the ignoble way so many of the world\u0027s children\r\nhave been treated.\r\nIn this context, the 25 August 1999 Security Council\r\ndebate on children in armed conflict has opened several\r\navenues that might be worth exploring for possible\r\ncollective action. What is certain is that the international\r\ncommunity must act, the sooner the better, so as to allow\r\neach child to enjoy his childhood far from battlefields,\r\nfrom sweatshops and from factories of multinational\r\ncorporations.\r\nThe fact is that the only worthwhile approach to this\r\nproblem is, on the one hand, to attack, in Africa in\r\nparticular, the underlying causes of poor living conditions\r\nand conflicts — causes that go by the names of poverty,\r\ndestitution and human suffering and which also provide\r\nmost fertile soil for intolerance, hatred and violence —\r\nand, on the other hand, to work to raise and educate\r\nchildren in a way that promotes the culture of peace as\r\nwell as dialogue and understanding among human beings.\r\nMay the international community finally assume its\r\nresponsibilities — all of its responsibilities — to children,\r\nwho are our most precious possession, so no child —\r\nwherever he may be, and whatever may be his race or\r\nreligion — will suffer any longer from destitution,\r\nviolence or the continuing indifference of adults.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the representative\r\nof Viet Nam, who will speak on behalf of the Group of\r\nAsian States.\r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh (Viet Nam): It is a great\r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly today in\r\nmy capacity as Chairman of the Asian Group on the\r\noccasion of the tenth anniversary of the General\r\nAssembly\u0027s adoption of the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child. Let me welcome the presence of national\r\ndelegations, representatives of United Nations institutions\r\nand agencies and other guests to this highly significant\r\ncommemoration. We likewise note with pleasure that a\r\nmultitude of events have been and will be organized in all\r\nparts of the world to mark this anniversary.\r\nThe adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild and its opening for signature 10 years ago were\r\nmilestones in the United Nations determination to make\r\nthe rights of the child legally binding and to create a legal\r\nframework for their protection and promotion. Within an\r\nunprecedentedly brief period of time, the Convention has\r\nbeen ratified or acceded to by 191 States. This almost\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nuniversal acceptance of the Convention not only shows that\r\nchildren\u0027s rights and interests are every nation\u0027s business,\r\nbut also demonstrates the political will that exists towards\r\nthe cause of child rights.\r\nIn this connection, we are proud to state that all Asian\r\ncountries have acceded to the Convention and are exerting\r\nefforts to protect and promote the rights of their children.\r\nIn many countries, to implement the Convention, national\r\nmechanisms have been established and national action plans\r\nhave been worked out; communication programmes to raise\r\npublic awareness of children\u0027s rights have been undertaken;\r\nnew laws or amendments to existing laws have been\r\nintroduced to harmonize national legislative provisions with\r\nthe Convention; and concrete measures have been carried\r\nout for the development of children.\r\nIn order to review the implementation of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, the General\r\nAssembly considers every year an agenda item under the\r\ntitle “Promotion and protection of the rights of children”.\r\nWe welcome and participate actively in the discussion on\r\nall the issues under this item, including those relating to\r\nchildren with disabilities; the prevention and eradication of\r\nthe sale of children and of their sexual exploitation; the\r\nprotection of children affected by armed conflict; refugee\r\nand internally displaced children; the elimination of the\r\nexploitation of child labour; and the plight of children\r\nliving and working on the streets. These debates help us to\r\nassess the achievements made and to determine what should\r\nbe done to overcome the obstacles or challenges.\r\nIn hailing the remarkable success of this Convention,\r\nwe cannot fail to note the active role played by the\r\nCommittee on the Rights of the Child in creating awareness\r\nof the principles and provisions of the Convention and\r\nproviding recommendations to States parties on ways to\r\naddress problems, including through international\r\ncooperation. The Office of the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) and its sister agencies in the United Nations\r\nhave been closely cooperating to address child rights issues\r\non the basis of the Plan of Action to strengthen the\r\nimplementation of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild.\r\nUNICEF\u0027s country programmes have been successful\r\nin many parts of the world, bringing effective and concrete\r\nassistance to millions of children, particularly those in need\r\nof special protection and from the developing countries.\r\nUNICEF is also active in supporting national efforts to\r\nimplement the Convention, such as adopting laws and\r\nregulations; developing institutions and budgetary analyses\r\nthat focus on children; collecting child-specific data;\r\nassessing the potential impact of policies on children;\r\npromoting a culture of respect for child rights, including\r\nthe participation of children; and so on. I would like to\r\ntake this perfect opportunity to express our appreciation\r\nto Mr. James Grant, former Executive Director of\r\nUNICEF, for his great contribution to the adoption of the\r\nConvention and the organization of the World Summit for\r\nChildren. We also thank Ms. Carol Bellamy, Executive\r\nDirector of UNICEF, and her staff for her tireless efforts\r\nand effective contributions to the enormous work done by\r\nUNICEF and, thus, to the welfare of children throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nWhile commemorating the tenth anniversary of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, we must not fail\r\nto note that 130 million children in the world today do\r\nnot have access to basic education; that 200 million\r\nchildren under the age of five are malnourished and 12\r\nmillion under-five deaths occur every year due to\r\nmalnutrition; that half of the world\u0027s 21 million refugees\r\nare children; and that over 20 million children have been\r\ndisplaced by war. Today, we also have to face the further\r\ncomplicated problems of child abuse and exploitation.\r\nIt is appropriate to say that the Convention has set\r\nin motion an ongoing process at all levels of society to\r\ntransform children from simple objects to full subjects of\r\nlaw. However, in order to fully realize this process,\r\nstrengthened efforts are warranted at both the national and\r\ninternational levels. We are here today to reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to that endeavour.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nCroatia, who will speak on behalf of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): The tenth anniversary of\r\nthe adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\nwill provide the international community with a unique\r\nopportunity to take stock of its achievements to date and\r\nto prepare itself for the evolving challenges to be faced\r\nby children in the next century.\r\nThe entry into force of the Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child on 2 September 1990 marked the culmination\r\nof nearly 70 years of efforts to bring the international\r\ncommunity to recognize the special needs and\r\nvulnerability of children. The fact that this Convention is\r\nthe most universally accepted human rights instrument in\r\nhistory has important ramifications. Rather than a\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\ncatalogue of rights, the Convention is an instrument for\r\nembedding a culture of respect for the basic needs of\r\nchildren, bolstered by the imperative of achieving the rights\r\nof all children everywhere without discrimination.\r\nWith its near-universal ratification, the Convention has\r\nbecome the centrepiece of international and national action\r\nto protect and promote the rights of the child. However,\r\nglobal mobilization is required to ensure that the spirit of\r\nthe letter is transformed into reality. Ratification alone will\r\nnot suffice; the well-being of children requires political\r\naction at the highest level.\r\nIn all of this, it should not be overlooked that the\r\nCommittee on the Rights of the Child continues to play a\r\ncrucial role in advocating and monitoring the\r\nimplementation of the Convention by those Governments\r\nthat have ratified it. The process of reporting to the\r\nCommittee provides an important opportunity for each State\r\nto review how it is implementing the Convention. To this\r\nend, the Committee has consistently encouraged States to\r\ntake special measures and develop special institutions for\r\nthe promotion and protection of children\u0027s rights.\r\nThe Eastern European Group of States renders its full\r\nsupport to the work of the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) as the leading agency for children within the\r\nUnited Nations system in its tireless mission to advocate the\r\nprotection of children\u0027s rights and to establish children\u0027s\r\nrights as enduring principles and international standards of\r\nbehaviour towards children. Like UNICEF, many other\r\nUnited Nations bodies are becoming increasingly involved\r\nin children\u0027s rights by adopting a rights-based approach in\r\ntheir methods of work. The Eastern European Group would\r\nalso like to warmly commend the efforts of all the other\r\nimportant actors within the United Nations system who are\r\nstriving with similar efforts to protect and promote the\r\nrights of the child.\r\nOn our path into the twenty-first century — one that\r\nhas been paved by a decade of dramatic progress for\r\nchildren, including the birth of the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child and the goals of the World Summit for\r\nChildren — more needs to be done in order to bridge the\r\ngap between existing international norms and their actual\r\nadherence in the field of children\u0027s rights. Having regard to\r\nthe long-standing work of the United Nations in this\r\nrespect, many have been struck by the commitment and\r\nactive participation of various actors within the United\r\nNations family, in particular with UNICEF at the helm of\r\nthe ongoing preparations for the follow-up to the World\r\nSummit for Children in the year 2001. The special session\r\nof the General Assembly in 2001 on the follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit is envisaged as the most representative\r\ngathering for children the world has ever seen in its\r\nendeavours to establish a new agenda with updated goals\r\nfor children for the twenty-first century.\r\nThe plight of children affected by armed conflicts is\r\nan extremely important and urgent issue when we discuss\r\nchildren\u0027s rights. Children in approximately 50 countries\r\naround the world are suffering in the midst of armed\r\nconflicts and their aftermath. The terrible consequences\r\nare all too visible, with over 2 million children having\r\nbeen killed in the last decade and over 20 million having\r\nbeen displaced by war. Flagrant violations of human\r\nrights and humanitarian law are all an affront to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. The protection of\r\nchildren in armed conflict must be framed by standards\r\nand norms embodied in international instruments, which\r\nexplicitly incorporate humanitarian law.\r\nThe draft optional protocol on the involvement of\r\nchildren in armed conflict contains significant language to\r\nthis effect. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that\r\nthe international community has made the fundamental\r\nmistake of rarely treating children as anything but\r\nvictims. Lasting peace can come only through respect for\r\nhuman rights, starting with the rights of children, who\r\nhave a crucial role to play as catalysts for peace.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, concerted efforts\r\ntowards poverty eradication must be undertaken so as to\r\nbridge the widening gap of disparities faced by children\r\nthroughout the world and to try to enable them to realize\r\nall of their economic, social and cultural rights. The\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child has been powerful\r\nin galvanizing efforts to put an end to this abuse. The\r\nrecent adoption of the International Labour Organization\r\nConvention 182 and Recommendation 190, concerning the\r\nprohibition and immediate action for the elimination of\r\nthe worst forms of child labour, represent a significant\r\nstep in the right direction. The challenges which remain\r\nare enormous, and the practical difficulties of changing\r\nthe lives of child victims are great.\r\nImplementation of children\u0027s rights at the national\r\nlevel also requires enormous and systematic efforts by\r\nnational Governments to ensure that an enabling\r\nenvironment is created where all rights of all children are\r\nachieved. State Governments must take on an obligation\r\nunder international law to implement the Convention, but\r\nevery sector of society needs to be involved if the\r\nConvention\u0027s principles and norms are to become reality.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nThe Convention does not bring change in the same\r\nway as a particular project in a particular country or\r\nneighbourhood. It works by bringing changes in countries\u0027\r\nlegislation, institutions and attitudes. The process may be\r\nslower, but the scale and consequences are far greater. We\r\nmust therefore rededicate ourselves to identifying ways and\r\nmeans to fund the protection needs of children, especially\r\nwhere resources are limited, as is the case for many\r\ncountries in transition. Despite the many difficulties of\r\ntransition experienced by countries in our part of the world,\r\nprogress has nevertheless been made in ensuring child\r\nsurvival, protection, development and participation. All the\r\ncountries in the region have ratified the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child, while several have created national\r\nprogrammes of action to implement the World Summit for\r\nChildren year 2000 goals.\r\nWe all want to make a difference for our future\r\ngenerations, and our efforts must not stop with this\r\ncommemoration. Hence, promoting children\u0027s rights must\r\nremain high on our agenda at the close of a decade marked\r\nby a multitude of achievements in the history of children\u0027s\r\nrights. Transforming this global commitment into a reality\r\nremains a task that must engage everyone. The international\r\ncommunity has to continue and increase its efforts to\r\nguarantee the best interests of all our children in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nMr. Christmas (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I am happy\r\nfor the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Latin America\r\nand Caribbean Group on this occasion of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child is the\r\nguiding light of the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), and as the tenth anniversary of the Convention\r\ncoincides with the dawn of the new millennium, let us look\r\nback in gratitude and look forward with courage to face the\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\nThough the Convention on the Rights of the Child can\r\nbe considered an offspring of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, it is obvious that human rights begin with\r\nchild rights. If there is respect for child rights, the\r\ncontagious effect is likely to spread to the rest of humanity.\r\nIt is a wonderful tribute to UNICEF and its partners\r\nthat the nations of the world were so sensitized and\r\nmobilized to adopt the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild as their own because, without this ownership, these\r\nchild rights would have been stillborn. Instead, the child\r\nand issues relating to children now figure prominently on\r\nthe political agenda of the world, in general, and at the\r\nLatin America and Caribbean region, specifically.\r\nIf the objective was only to gain acceptance of child\r\nrights by the nations of the world, the victory would have\r\nbeen a hollow one, and meaningful realization of the\r\nrights would have been a distant dream.\r\nThese rights could not have been universally\r\nimplemented and realized until more children had\r\nadequate access to education, the main ingredient for\r\ndevelopment; until health services and water and\r\nsanitation were accessible; and until some of the\r\nfundamental obstacles to development, such as wide\r\nincome gaps, inequity in access to basic social services\r\nand armed conflict, were removed.\r\nTo the credit of UNICEF and its partners, the goals\r\nwere agreed to at the World Summit for Children in\r\n1990. These goals form a major part of UNICEF\u0027s\r\ncountry programmes, thereby complementing and giving\r\npractical effect to child rights. Thus, the Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child and the World Summit goals are\r\ndifferent sides of the same coin. UNICEF must be\r\ncongratulated for initiating this two-pronged approach. It\r\nworks.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child is not necessarily a time for\r\ncelebration, but a time for stock-taking and reflection, a\r\npause along the development pathway to determine\r\nwhether a course correction is necessary.\r\nIn the Latin America and Caribbean region,\r\nsubstantial progress has been made in the context of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and its\r\ncomplementary World Summit goals.\r\nMost countries of the region have reviewed their\r\nlegislation to ensure that it is in compliance with the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. About half of\r\nthese countries have adapted national laws to the\r\nConvention. Legal reform has been undertaken in many\r\nof these countries through the training of judges, public\r\nprosecutors, law enforcement agents and child protection\r\nworkers.\r\nIn a number of countries, child rights issues have\r\nbeen debated and discussed as election issues. Children\u0027s\r\nparticipation and their ability to voice their concerns in\r\ndecisions and situations that affect their lives have grown\r\nthroughout the region.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nSeveral countries have demonstrated their commitment\r\nto increasing their support for basic services for children.\r\nAt the same time, many countries of the region have\r\nestablished national bodies related to the rights of the child.\r\nThe region has witnessed remarkable achievements\r\nduring the past decade in the area of children\u0027s health. For\r\nexample, we have seen the eradication of polio, a 95 per\r\ncent reduction in measles deaths, the virtual elimination of\r\nneonatal tetanus and the universal iodization of salt for\r\nhuman consumption. The average infant mortality rate\r\ndropped from 51 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 33 per\r\n1,000 in 1998, and the rate for children under the age of\r\nfive went from 60 to 41 in the same period.\r\nAccess to basic education has increased significantly,\r\nand primary school enrolment rates are about 87 per cent.\r\nThe State of the World\u0027s Children report has indicated that\r\nthe region has a higher enrolment rate than any other region\r\nin the developing world at the pre-primary, secondary, and\r\ntertiary levels, and that girls participate at rates equal to or\r\nhigher than those for boys.\r\nAlthough the Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\nhas given impetus to actions in the region to eliminate child\r\nlabour, the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1995\r\nestimated that there were approximately 15 million working\r\nchildren under 15 years of age in the region. Thus, we\r\nwelcome with eager anticipation the coming of the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010, as this\r\nshould additionally highlight the plight of children.\r\nDespite these positive elements, the challenges facing\r\nchildren are daunting. We have a wonderful opportunity as\r\nwe stand at the threshold of the new millennium. As we\r\nclean the slate, as we turn to a new page, as we make a\r\nnew resolution, let us put children first and permanently\r\nplace them on the political agenda of every nation. Let the\r\nprogress of our civilization be predicated on the well-being\r\nof our children. To lose a customer is to lose a battle. To\r\nlose this opportunity is to lose the war. Of the four things\r\nthat do not come back, one is a neglected opportunity.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein): This is a day of\r\ncelebration. Today we mark the tenth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This\r\nConvention and its near-universal ratification, as well as the\r\nwork of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, have for\r\nthe first time brought into sharp focus the human rights of\r\nchildren. It is my privilege to speak on this very special\r\noccasion on behalf of the Western European and other\r\nStates Group.\r\nThere are many compelling reasons that led to the\r\nelaboration of the Convention on the Rights of the Child:\r\nchildren are individuals, and Governments have a\r\nresponsibility to recognize their human rights at all levels\r\nof society; children are dependent on adults, and their\r\ndevelopmental stage makes them particularly vulnerable;\r\nfailing children results in high costs — whatever happens\r\nto children in their early years significantly influences\r\ntheir positive or negative development; and children\r\ngenerally have very limited opportunities to voice their\r\nown concerns and are rarely ever involved in decision-\r\nmaking. For these and many more reasons, Governments\r\nrecognized that children needed to be given higher\r\npriority and careful attention.\r\nHowever, the world has moved slowly to recognize\r\nthe human rights of children. The League of Nations\r\nadopted the first Declaration of the Rights of the Child in\r\n1924. While the Charter of the United Nations speaks of\r\npromoting and encouraging respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms for all, and the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights stresses that all human\r\nbeings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, it\r\nwas in 1948 that the General Assembly adopted a brief\r\nseven-point declaration of the rights of the child. A\r\ndecade later, the 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the\r\nChild was adopted. Following a proposal by Poland, a\r\nworking group to elaborate the Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child was established in 1979, and on 20\r\nNovember 1989 the General Assembly unanimously\r\nadopted the Convention, which entered into force in\r\nSeptember 1990 after a very speedy process of signature\r\nand ratification.\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child is a\r\npowerful instrument for the world\u0027s children and affirms\r\nthat children are the subjects of rights, not simply objects\r\nof concern or beneficiaries of services. They are entitled\r\nto the action of our Governments, of institutions and of\r\nindividuals. The best interest of the child — the phrase\r\nwhich best captures the spirit of the Convention — is to\r\nguide action in many areas where children are affected or\r\ninvolved.\r\nWe have to acknowledge that in some important\r\nrespects the Convention does not provide the protection\r\nwhich we had envisaged and hoped for. We would\r\ntherefore like to highlight the important work of the two\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nworking groups of the Commission on Human Rights and\r\nto underline the need for an early conclusion of their work.\r\nWhile the task of realizing children\u0027s rights is a\r\nuniversal one, the Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\naddresses primarily Governments. The Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States would like to commend the\r\nCommittee on the Rights of the Child, which monitors the\r\nimplementation of the Convention for its work. The\r\nCommittee has been very influential in promoting a\r\ngrowing sensitivity and in creating a higher political priority\r\nfor children. Unfortunately, the present composition of 10\r\nmembers is insufficient to ensure a more rapid and efficient\r\nexecution of the Committee\u0027s functions. We encourage the\r\nStates parties to the Convention that have not yet ratified\r\nthe amendment to article 43, paragraph 2, of the\r\nConvention, which increases the membership of the\r\nCommittee from 10 to 18, to do so on an urgent basis in\r\norder to reach the two-thirds threshold required for the\r\namendment to enter into force. Realizing the human rights\r\nof children will be for the benefit of all, a fulfilment of our\r\nduties and an investment in the future. In this regard, we\r\nlook forward to the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in 2001 on the follow-up to the World Summit\r\nfor Children and recognize the significance of the\r\nConvention in considering future action.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of the\r\nUnited States of America, the host country.\r\nMs. King (United States of America): The year 1999\r\nmarks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. One of the top\r\npriorities of any nation should be the enhancement and\r\nprotection of the rights of children. Children constitute one\r\nof the most vulnerable groups within the boundaries of any\r\nState. They are victims of violence, disease, malnutrition\r\nand sexual exploitation. They represent over 50 per cent of\r\nthe world\u0027s refugees, displaced persons and conflict victims.\r\nThey are often separated from their families, deprived of\r\neducation and, too frequently, forcibly recruited by armed\r\nfactions. Millions of children under the age of 15 around\r\nthe world are employed full- or part-time in what can be\r\ndescribed as exploitative child labour. Children are at the\r\nmercy of the adults around them. They have little to say in\r\ntheir affairs. They cry out for help that is frequently not\r\nthere.\r\nThe United States remains committed to the betterment\r\nof children nationally and internationally. As a nation, we\r\nplace the highest priority on the well-being of children, not\r\nonly at home, but around the world. Both our President and\r\nFirst Lady have spoken out on several occasions on the\r\nimportance of improving the quality of life of children.\r\nRecently, President Clinton addressed the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO) in Geneva on this issue. We\r\nstrongly oppose exploitative child labour and view it as a\r\nhuman rights abuse. The United States is therefore is a\r\nstrong supporter of the ILO Convention concerning the\r\nProhibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of\r\nthe Worst Forms of Child Labour, adopted last June.\r\nPresident Clinton has directed all federal agencies of the\r\nUnited States Government to make absolutely certain that\r\nthey are not buying any products made with abusive child\r\nlabour.\r\nThe President is also concerned about the heinous\r\npractice of trafficking in children, which for thousands of\r\nchildren around the world means bondage, rape,\r\nprostitution and physical brutality. A year ago he\r\nestablished a strategy which focuses on prevention,\r\nprotection for victims and prosecution of traffickers. The\r\nworld community must bond together to put an end to\r\nthis despicable practice.\r\nActions speak louder than words. Our commitment\r\nto the protection of children\u0027s rights is unquestionable. We\r\nhelp children at risk through support for multilateral\r\nprogrammes, non-governmental organizations and a wide\r\nvariety of official bilateral assistance and diplomatic\r\ninitiatives. We are major supporters of many United\r\nNations programmes that have a substantial focus on\r\nhelping children, such as the United Nations Children\u0027s\r\nFund (UNICEF), the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the World Food\r\nProgramme, just to name a few. At this point, I would\r\nlike to join other speakers in congratulating Carol\r\nBellamy and her wonderful staff at UNICEF for the work\r\nthey do on behalf of children around the world.\r\nBilaterally, the United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development (USAID) has been a major\r\nsupporter of child programmes for 25 years. Today, more\r\nthan 4 million child deaths are prevented annually due to\r\ncritical life-saving health services provided by USAID.\r\nAlthough the United States has not ratified the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, our actions to\r\nprotect and defend children both at home and abroad\r\nclearly demonstrate our commitment to the welfare of\r\nchildren.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 11 November 1999\r\nThe international community can remain assured that\r\nwe, as a nation, stand ready to assist in any way we can to\r\nenhance and protect the human rights of children wherever\r\nthey may be.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to conclude\r\nits consideration of agenda item 165?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.35 a.m.\r\n12\r\n"
