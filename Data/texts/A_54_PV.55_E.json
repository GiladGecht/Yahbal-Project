(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mbanefo\r\n(Nigeria), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 154 (continued)\r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law: marking\r\nof the end of the United Nations Decade of International\r\nLaw\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/362 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nLetter dated 10 September 1999 from the\r\nPermanent Representatives of the Netherlands and\r\nthe Russian Federation addressed to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/54/381)\r\nReport of the Sixth Committee (A/54/609)\r\nMr. Santos (Mozambique): I have the honer to speak\r\non behalf of the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) member States, namely, Angola, Botswana, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Malawi,\r\nMauritius, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland,\r\nTanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and my own country,\r\nMozambique. The SADC countries would like to associate\r\nthemselves with the statements made by South Africa and\r\nthe Sudan on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nAfrican Group, respectively.\r\nAs the United Nations Decade of International Law\r\nis now reaching its end, we think it is time to pause and\r\ntake stock of the achievements and the work undertaken\r\nduring the Decade. At the dawn of a new millennium, this\r\nexercise is not only appropriate but also necessary as a\r\nway to gather momentum and inspiration to face the\r\nmany challenges that still await the world in the years\r\nahead.\r\nThe world is witnessing the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization, making cooperation among nations\r\nimperative. On the other hand, war and violence still\r\nravage many parts of the world, claiming millions of\r\ninnocent lives and causing social and economic havoc.\r\nIt is a tragic reality that the African continent is one\r\nwhich is characterized by strife and conflicts, the majority\r\nof which are internal conflicts. Southern Africa, in\r\nparticular, has been and continues to be subject to these\r\ntypes of conflicts, which have resulted in untold suffering,\r\ndestruction and loss of life and property.\r\nIf we truly want to avert such situations, all nations\r\nof the world must be guided in their relations by the\r\nprinciples and rules of international law and resolve their\r\ndisputes by peaceful means, as proposed in the statement\r\nof the Decade’s main purposes.\r\nIt is in this spirit that SADC countries participated\r\nactively in many international forums, at the subregional,\r\nregional and international levels, where important treaties\r\nwere adopted. In this regard, we must acknowledge the\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nundeniable and remarkable advances achieved during the\r\ndecade in the area of progressive development and\r\ncodification of international law, one of the main purposes\r\nof the Decade.\r\nThe Rio Declaration adopted in 1992 built on the\r\nStockholm Declaration of 1972 and created the guiding\r\nprinciples of international environmental law, including\r\nAgenda 21. Subsequently, several conventions have been\r\nadopted in compliance with these principles and in order to\r\nregulate specific areas of international environmental law,\r\nthus creating a new and autonomous body of international\r\nlaw.\r\nMany other extremely important conventions have also\r\nbeen adopted, such as the Ottawa Convention on landmines\r\nand the Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational\r\nUses of International Watercourses.\r\nThe adoption in Rome, in 1998, of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court constitutes a landmark of the\r\nDecade. SADC countries participated actively in the\r\nnegotiation of the Rome Statute. We believe that the early\r\nentry into force of the Statute and the commencement of\r\nthe Court’s operations will put an end to the culture of\r\nimpunity and will help establish a culture of peace\r\nworldwide.\r\nCertainly another major achievement was the entry\r\ninto force in 1994 of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea and the subsequent establishment and\r\neffective functioning of various organs provided for in the\r\nConvention, including the International Tribunal for the\r\nLaw of the Sea. That Tribunal constitutes an additional and\r\nspecialized forum for the peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\ncomplementary to the International Court of Justice.\r\nAdequate resources must be provided to these bodies in\r\norder to permit them to function adequately.\r\nThis year the Summit of SADC heads of State or\r\nGovernment had the theme “SADC in the Next\r\nMillennium — Working Together for Peace, Progress and\r\nProsperity”. That Summit adopted regional legal\r\ninstruments on wildlife conservation and on law\r\nenforcement. The Summit also noted the entry into force of\r\nthe charter of the Regional Tourism Organization of\r\nSouthern Africa and of the regional protocols on shared\r\nwatercourse systems, energy, transport, communications and\r\nmeteorology. Previously, SADC countries had adopted or\r\nratified a wide range of protocols and agreements that\r\nregulate areas such as tourism, wildlife conservation, drug\r\ntrafficking, energy and transport.\r\nThe organization reiterated its strong commitment to\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through local\r\nmechanisms of conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution, thus assuming its role in contributing to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security in the region. It was\r\nalso in southern Africa that the first meeting of States\r\nparties to the Ottawa treaty on landmines took place in\r\nMay of this year. This was a demonstration of the\r\nimportance of the involvement of all nations, regardless\r\nof their economic capacity, in the effort to attain the goals\r\nof peace and stability in the world.\r\nThe SADC countries would like to express their\r\nsincere gratitude to the Governments of the Kingdom of\r\nthe Netherlands and the Russian Federation for having\r\ninitiated and co-hosted — as a well-deserved tribute at the\r\nclose of the United Nations Decade of International\r\nLaw — the centennial celebrations of the first\r\nInternational Peace Conference. The meetings at The\r\nHague and St. Petersburg were excellent occasions for\r\nreflecting on important issues of disarmament,\r\nhumanitarian law and the peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\nwhich today are as much a part of the world’s main\r\nagenda as they were a hundred years ago.\r\nIn southern Africa, representatives of SADC member\r\nStates, as well as of all sectors of society, were invited to\r\nparticipate in a seminar held earlier this year in Pretoria\r\nto commemorate the first International Peace Conference\r\nof 1889. The seminar re-evaluated the aims and\r\naspirations of the Hague Conference in the light of the\r\nspecific problems and needs of the African continent, and\r\nin particular of the southern African region.\r\nIt was emphasized at the seminar that, although the\r\npotential use of nuclear weapons remains an ever-present\r\ndanger and a very real threat, the real and present danger\r\nof all conflicts is the threat posed by small arms. Small\r\narms are responsible for the killing of millions of people,\r\nmostly civilians, in many regions of the world,\r\nparticularly in Africa. If the ideals of the Hague\r\nConference are to be pertinent and relevant to the African\r\ncontinent, then the pressing problem of the use and\r\nproliferation of small arms will have to be addressed.\r\nThe southern African region in particular suffers\r\nfrom a surfeit of available weapons. The proliferation of\r\nsmall arms in the southern African region is a product\r\nboth of the past and of the current demand for arms for\r\nspecific security needs and criminal purposes. The task of\r\nregulating and controlling these arms is huge and\r\nmultifaceted, and the most effective means to accomplish\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nit is through regional cooperation. Fortunately, there is a\r\ngrowing willingness to engage in such regional cooperation\r\nand a genuine desire for peace and development in the\r\nsouthern African region. Practical steps are under way in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe spirit of The Hague should guide us to the next\r\nmillennium. It proposes seeking an end to violence, through\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and a humanitarian\r\napproach. Every peace-loving nation must remain\r\ncommitted to the spirit of the Hague Conference and to the\r\ngoals of the Decade if we are indeed to create a better\r\nworld guided by the international rule of law.\r\nThe strong wind of change in the world, calling for\r\nthe establishment of democratic, transparent and just\r\nsystems of governance based on full respect for the rule of\r\nlaw, must also reach the international-relations scene. We\r\ncall on all the nations of the world to work together for a\r\nbetter millennium, free of violence and poverty — a world\r\nwithout haves and have-nots, a world where peace is the\r\nrule rather than an exception.\r\nThe objectives of the Decade remain as valid today as\r\nthey were 10 years ago. It is our wish that the United\r\nNations will continue to be active and vigilant in promoting\r\nthe objectives of the Decade into the next millennium.\r\nMr. Vázquez (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\ndelegation of Ecuador would like to express its gratitude to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his far-reaching report on the\r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law, which\r\nprovides a comprehensive look at the many diverse actions\r\nundertaken by States, the United Nations system, regional\r\norganizations and the academic sector, with the goal of\r\nfulfilling the Decade’s purposes, which were set out in\r\nresolution 44/23.\r\nAs regards the results that have been achieved in the\r\nprogressive development and codification of international\r\nlaw, my delegation feels that the bottom line is quite\r\npositive. This can be seen in the many multilateral\r\ninstruments that have been adopted in the course of the\r\nDecade.\r\nThe United Nations in particular has been able to\r\nrespond effectively to the challenge of providing proper\r\nlegal responses to many vital issues on the international\r\nagenda. With international society now characterized by a\r\ncomplex interdependence among its members and requiring\r\nthe ongoing development of norms that reflect and adapt to\r\nthe changing realities of the contemporary world, the\r\ncurrency of such vital issues, rather than dwindling, is\r\ngrowing daily. My delegation believes that the declaration\r\nof the 1990s as the Decade of International Law, with its\r\nprogramme of activities, provided a strong impetus for\r\ndoing this work.\r\nSpecial mention should be made of the work of the\r\nInternational Law Commission on progressive\r\ndevelopment and codification and of the consultative\r\nwork and concrete application of principles and\r\ninternational norms carried out by the International Court\r\nof Justice.\r\nInternational law, however, is not shaped by the\r\nnegotiation of conventions alone. When we talk of the\r\ndevelopment of international law, we cannot fail to\r\nrecognize the important role played by international\r\ncustom and the interrelationship between conventional and\r\ncustomary norms, as enshrined in the official\r\njurisprudence of the International Court of Justice. Indeed,\r\nthe Court has acknowledged the validity, as international\r\ncustom, of fundamental norms of the international legal\r\norder that transcend those contained in a convention.\r\nMoreover, the International Court of Justice has\r\nrecognized that customary law does not necessarily evolve\r\nentirely independently of treaties, but can also be\r\nexpressed in general multilateral conventions or at\r\ncodification conferences that are widely attended. The text\r\nof a convention can declare a prior customary norm; it\r\ncan also define a norm that is still evolving; or, finally,\r\nthe de lege ferenda provision of a treaty or a proposal\r\nmade at an international conference can eventually\r\nbecome the axis of a subsequent state practice that,\r\nfollowing a consolidation period, becomes a customary\r\nnorm. This can also apply, to a certain degree, to the\r\ncontent of quite a few resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt should be pointed out that resolutions in and of\r\nthemselves are not a formal source of international law.\r\nNevertheless, in certain cases, interaction can arise\r\nbetween customary law and the content of certain\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, the principal organ\r\nof the United Nations. This content can be seen as\r\nevidence of what States may consider to be law in a\r\nspecific area, especially if it has been formulated as a\r\nnorm or principle to which States must adjust their\r\nbehaviour.\r\nIf the validity of law in international relations is to\r\nbe ensured, it is not enough to develop norms. It is also\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\ncrucial to ensure their respect and observance, for which we\r\nmust redouble our efforts and identify mechanisms to\r\nensure that all States take international law and respect for\r\nits principles as a model of conduct.\r\nThere is no room for half-hearted positions in the\r\ncommitment of States to international law, much less for\r\nthose that would discredit it. The strengthening of\r\ninternational law is certainly not promoted by unilateral\r\ninterpretations of clear international obligations contained\r\nin legally binding instruments.\r\nIt has been said that, in the wake of the cold war, the\r\ninternational order is in a state of transition and that, while\r\nthe harmful effects of the cold war shaped the future of the\r\ninternational community for several decades, international\r\nactors knew what to expect, even if it was only to expect\r\nthe worst. In the current period, however, which some call\r\ntransitional, a sense of uncertainty is emerging that will\r\npersist if we do not enshrine respect for law and if there is\r\na will not to consolidate international law based on\r\ncooperation to the mutual benefit of all, but to create\r\ninternational law allowing unilateral or group advantages to\r\nbe won.\r\nAs a result, it is not only proper, but crucial that\r\ninternational actors behave on the basis of international law,\r\nrespect for which is the only way to achieve certainty and\r\nstrengthened confidence and cooperation at all levels. In\r\nthis context, we can appreciate the validity of the words set\r\ndown four centuries by Hugo Grocio, who anticipated the\r\nprinciple of interdependence among all States members of\r\nthe international community and stressed the certainty that\r\nemerges through respect for law:\r\n“Law is not based on utility alone. There is no\r\nState so powerful that it does not sometimes require\r\nthe assistance of others, be it in commerce or even to\r\nprotect itself from the forces of foreign nations united\r\nagainst it. As a result, we see that even the most\r\npowerful and sovereign people seek alliances, which\r\nare totally meaningless to those who would confine\r\nlaw within state boundaries. Nothing is truer than the\r\nsaying that everything becomes uncertain once men\r\nstray from the law.”\r\nAnother main objective of the Decade is promoting\r\nmeans and methods for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nAs my delegation stressed before the Sixth Committee, the\r\nbest contribution that two countries have been able to make\r\ntowards its achievement was the overall peace agreement\r\nsigned just over a year ago between Ecuador and Peru,\r\nwhich resolved the border conflict that they had waged\r\nfor over 150 years. This overall agreement included,\r\ninter alia, the demarcation of the shared land border, a\r\ntrade and navigation treaty, a broad agreement for border\r\nintegration, development and good-neighbourliness, and\r\nthe establishment of a binational committee on confidence\r\nand security measures. This was an important\r\nachievement for the consolidation of peace and security\r\nin Latin America and can serve as an example to the rest\r\nof the world of how to settle disputes peacefully and to\r\ndevelop cooperation in a post-conflict era.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its gratitude to the\r\nGovernments of the Russian Federation and the Kingdom\r\nof the Netherlands for having prepared the centennial\r\ncommemoration of the First International Peace\r\nConference at The Hague and for submitting the report on\r\nits results. Undoubtedly, this commemoration highlighted\r\nthe historic importance of the First Conference,\r\nparticularly as the birthplace of multilateral diplomacy to\r\ndevelop concerted and coordinated action in the quest for\r\npeace.\r\nEcuador feels that the commemoration was an\r\nimportant opportunity for reflection on and analysis of the\r\nthree topics of the First International Peace Conference.\r\nIt is clear that the noble goals and objectives of those\r\nwho participated in it 100 years ago in defence of peace\r\nand international law remain fully valid today in our\r\nturbulent world.\r\nThe United Nations must redouble its efforts to\r\npursue the objectives of the Decade, which will always be\r\nvalid. We must also stress the importance of the\r\ncommitment that all States should make to international\r\nlaw — a commitment that should include increasingly\r\neffective compliance with international law and respect\r\nfor its principles.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nMy delegation would like to associate itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of South Africa,\r\nwho spoke on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nTen years ago this Assembly made a historic\r\ndecision. Upon the initiative of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and in accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 44/23, the period 1989-1999 was proclaimed\r\nthe United Nations Decade of International Law. The\r\nproclamation of the Decade of International Law was\r\nindeed a timely measure, indicative of the growing\r\nconviction of nations that in a highly interdependent\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nworld everyone’s interests are best served by a more\r\nprincipled and orderly system based on law. This cardinal\r\ngoal and the four main objectives of the Decade that were\r\nrelevant at the time of the declaration of the Decade are\r\napplicable today and will continue to be pertinent in years\r\nto come. This is the message that we should convey to\r\nsucceeding generations: peace and security in the world can\r\nbe preserved only through the predominance of the rule of\r\nlaw in international relations.\r\nAt this stage, when the Decade is approaching its\r\ntermination, a glimpse at the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/54/362), which reflects the programmes carried out in\r\nthe past 10 years, shows that much has been accomplished\r\nin implementing the Decade’s concepts. First and foremost,\r\nthe establishment of two ad hoc Tribunals by the United\r\nNations to bring to justice the perpetrators of the most\r\nheinous crimes in the territory of the former Yugoslavia\r\nand in Rwanda, as well as the adoption of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court in Rome in 1998, were among\r\nthe major achievements of the community of nations during\r\nthe Decade. We remain convinced that the establishment of\r\na universal and effective Criminal Court will provide\r\nsucceeding generations with the best hope for achieving a\r\nworld spared the scourges of aggression and genocide,\r\nwhich over this century have caused the loss of millions of\r\npeople’s lives worldwide.\r\nMoreover, various activities carried out in the course\r\nof the Decade have helped disseminate its noble goals\r\namong various sectors of the society of nations. The United\r\nNations Congress on Public International Law, which was\r\nconvened upon the proposal of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nand Mexico in this Assembly in 1995, was a successful\r\nexercise in involving pertinent institutions, academicians\r\nand individuals in the promotion of the Decade’s purposes.\r\nCelebrations of the centennial of the first International\r\nPeace Conference of 1899, convened upon the initiatives of\r\nthe Netherlands and the Russian Federation at The Hague\r\nand St. Petersburg in 1999, were also meaningful\r\ncontributions to the Decade’s activities.\r\nThus, we wish to commend all individuals,\r\ninstitutions, Governments and non-governmental\r\nagencies that have contributed to the dissemination of the\r\nlofty objectives of the Decade around the world and those\r\nwho have helped to enrich the content of its programme of\r\nactivities. The working group of the Sixth Committee on\r\nthe United Nations Decade of International Law, as the\r\nmain coordinating body of the activities of the Decade, and\r\nthe United Nations Office of Legal Affairs deserve credit\r\nfor their tireless efforts. Certainly, their endeavours have\r\nimmensely facilitated the development and the\r\nimplementation of the Decade’s programmes.\r\nThe end of 10 years of focused work to promote the\r\nprevalence of the rule of law in international relations\r\ndoes not necessarily mean that all objectives of the\r\nDecade have been fully realized. I venture to take this\r\nopportunity to pinpoint two areas requiring serious and\r\nclose attention in the coming years.\r\nFirstly, it is crystal clear that in a well-organized\r\nworld system based on the rule of law, decentralized\r\nreactions to possible cases of violation of norms and\r\nprinciples of international law cannot be permissible. It is\r\nequally true that in a law-abiding society of nations,\r\nStates cannot and should not take the law into their own\r\nhands and be the judges of their own conduct. Obviously,\r\nthe very nature of unilateral measures of a punitive\r\ncharacter, which have unfortunately been on the rise in\r\nrecent years, is detrimental to the cause of promotion of\r\nand respect for the principles of international law, which\r\nconstitutes one of the main objectives of the Decade. The\r\nstrong opposition demonstrated by various Governments\r\naround the world vis-à-vis the application of unilateral\r\nsanctions, including in particular the adoption of General\r\nAssembly resolutions 53/10 and 54/21, illustrates the firm\r\ndetermination of the community of nations to reject\r\nunilateralism in its entirety. Undoubtedly, the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, which has passed the test of time,\r\nprovides appropriate mechanisms to counter those who\r\nchallenge the basic norms of international society. It is\r\ntherefore imperative for all States and international\r\norganizations to continue to act in accordance with\r\ninternational law and the Charter provisions. This is an\r\nimportant recommendation contained in the programme of\r\nactivities of the Decade, which must be fully kept in\r\nperspective, in words and programmes and, more\r\nimportantly, in deeds and decisions.\r\nSecondly, I wish to underline the important duty\r\nassigned to the United Nations with respect to promoting\r\ndisarmament and arms control, which undoubtedly is an\r\nessential factor for the preservation of world peace and\r\nsecurity. Beyond doubt, years of negotiations in this field\r\nhave led to some success in the prohibition of certain\r\ntypes of weapons of mass destruction. But despite the\r\nincremental success, achievements have been minimal\r\nwith regard to the elimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nMoreover, recent developments in some regions have not\r\nonly called into question the credibility of the non-\r\nproliferation regime, but have also seriously challenged\r\nthe effectiveness of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nTreaty. Therefore, nuclear disarmament should be the focus\r\nof our attention for years to come. In these circumstance,\r\nwe will not be comforted by believing that the turn of the\r\nmillennium will easily bring about a secure world for\r\nhumankind.\r\nAt the threshold of the new millennium, people around\r\nthe world, in whose name the United Nations Charter was\r\ndrawn up, continue to aspire towards full implementation of\r\nthe Charter’s purposes and principles. We, the\r\nrepresentatives of the Governments elected by those people,\r\nshould spare no effort to realize a world with full respect\r\nfor human dignity, a better standard of living, strict\r\nadherence to international law and justice and, above all,\r\nthe materialization of a secure world, free from weapons of\r\nmass destruction of any kind and the evil of war.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): My delegation would\r\nfirst of all like to associate itself with the statement on this\r\nitem made earlier by the representative of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nTen years ago, on this very day, the General Assembly\r\ndeclared the Decade of International Law in its resolution\r\n44/23. The main purposes of the Decade were to promote\r\nacceptance of and respect for the principles of international\r\nlaw; to promote means and methods for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes between States, including the resort\r\nto and full respect for the International Court of Justice; to\r\nencourage the progressive development of international law\r\nand its codification; and to encourage the teaching, study,\r\ndissemination and wider appreciation of international law.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the Decade vividly\r\ndemonstrates that it has been a success. Important\r\ninternational treaties and conventions have been concluded\r\nin such fields as environmental and human rights\r\nprotection, disarmament and maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. In the latter field alone, the international\r\ncommunity has witnessed the establishment of the\r\nInternational Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, for\r\nRwanda and for the law of the sea. The adoption of the\r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court marked\r\nanother milestone in strengthening both the concept of\r\nindividual criminal responsibility and deterrence to the\r\ncommission of heinous international crimes. The report also\r\npoints out that recourse to the International Court of Justice\r\nhas significantly increased. These points alone demonstrate\r\nthat the Decade contributed significantly to the development\r\nand promotion of international law, thus promoting the\r\nstrengthening of the rule of law.\r\nEnormous work has been undertaken during the\r\nDecade to encourage the teaching, study, dissemination\r\nand wider appreciation of international law. Many\r\nimportant and useful conferences, seminars, symposia,\r\ntraining workshops and other activities have been\r\nsuccessfully held. On its part, the Secretariat of the\r\nUnited Nations, especially the Office of Legal Affairs, has\r\nundertaken many useful measures, including promoting\r\nthe implementation of the programmes and activities of\r\nthe Decade, strengthening the Treaty Section’s electronic\r\ndatabase, expediting the registration of treaties and their\r\npublication, eliminating the enormous backlog in the\r\npublication of the United Nations Treaty Series and\r\nestablishing Internet Web sites and an audio-visual library\r\nin international law. We believe that the Secretariat\r\nshould be commended for taking these measures.\r\nWithin the framework of the Decade, the General\r\nAssembly, on Mongolia’s initiative, last year adopted\r\nresolution 53/101 containing the principles and guidelines\r\nfor international negotiations. We are confident that these\r\nprinciples and guidelines will prove useful for the\r\nmanagement of international relations, the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes and the creation of new norms of\r\ninternational conduct.\r\nMongolia welcomes the results of the celebrations of\r\nthe centennial of the first International Peace Conference.\r\nThe themes of the Hague Conference of 1899 —\r\ndisarmament, humanitarian law, laws of war and peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes — remain as relevant today as they\r\nwere 100 years ago. In this connection, we believe that\r\nthe celebrations have contributed to further developing\r\nthose broad themes. Thus, the spirit of the Martens Clause\r\nhas found further development and embodiment in many\r\ninternational instruments. Therefore, my delegation joins\r\nprevious speakers in expressing its gratitude to the\r\nGovernments of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and of\r\nthe Russian Federation for contributing to the organization\r\nof the celebrations of the centennial.\r\nAlthough the Decade is drawing to a close, that does\r\nnot mean that the international efforts in advancing the\r\nrule of law and the codification and progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law should be weakened. On\r\nthe contrary, the end of the Decade marks a new stage in\r\nthe efforts of the international community to strengthen\r\nand promote further the principles and norms of\r\ninternational law. If we look around, we all realize that\r\nmuch more still needs to be done in this respect.\r\nMoreover, besides codification and progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law, the existing principles\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nand norms need to be strengthened, strictly enforced and\r\nfully implemented.\r\nAs rightly reflected in the draft resolution before us on\r\nthis item, Member States should consider becoming parties,\r\nif they have not yet done so, to the multilateral treaties\r\nadopted during the Decade, including those listed in the\r\nannex to the Secretary-General’s report. We believe that the\r\nwider recognition and appreciation of international law\r\nachieved as a result of the Decade will undoubtedly serve\r\nto achieve these aims.\r\nMr. Singh (India): The Indian delegation expresses its\r\nappreciation for the efforts of the Governments of the\r\nNetherlands and of the Russian Federation for organizing\r\nand hosting activities to commemorate the centennial of the\r\nfirst International Peace Conference of 1899, held in The\r\nHague. The centennial provided a valuable opportunity for\r\nexperts from all over the world, including the Asian and\r\nAfrican continents, to participate actively and make their\r\ncontributions. The three important areas covered were\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, disarmament and\r\ninternational humanitarian law. We would like to commend\r\nthe four eminent Special Rapporteurs for their erudite and\r\nextremely well-researched reports, which provided the basis\r\nfor participants to present their views. As one of the\r\nFriends of 1999, the Government of India was happy to be\r\nassociated with this exercise. In this regard, we also\r\ncommend the regional meeting held under the auspices of\r\nthe Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee at New\r\nDelhi in February 1999.\r\nThe Hague Peace Conferences of 1889 and 1907\r\ninitiated a trend in the evolution of international\r\norganizations and international law by eliciting wider\r\nparticipation of States in deliberations on critical issues of\r\ninternational concern, and in the evolution of responses by\r\nthe international community. While we recognize that\r\nachieving a consensus on difficult and sensitive matters in\r\nwhich the interests of the international community are\r\ndivided is not easy, imposing a set of interests of one group\r\nof States rather than another, through the manipulation of\r\nconference techniques and procedures — a practice that has\r\nunfortunately become common of late — is equally\r\nundemocratic in a world where States are struggling at\r\ndifferent stages of economic development and are hence\r\nfaced with different sets of priorities in their national\r\nagendas.\r\nThe scope of crimes under international humanitarian\r\nlaw has increasingly been the subject matter of liberal\r\ninterpretation. In this regard the impact of public opinion on\r\nthe formation of opinio juris and customary law deserves\r\ncloser scrutiny. The International Committee of the Red\r\nCross study of customary rules of international\r\nhumanitarian law, now in progress, will reveal whether\r\nStates are prepared to accept an expansive interpretation\r\nof international customary law without much supporting\r\npractice. We have not yet invented any method acceptable\r\nto all in achieving the necessary consensus before certain\r\nprinciples can be ordained as prescriptions which all\r\nStates are willing to accept as obligations admitting no\r\nreservations.\r\nWhether it is the role of the Security Council under\r\nthe United Nations Charter to establish a permanent\r\ninternational criminal court, to set up ad hoc international\r\ncriminal tribunals or to enforce humanitarian law through\r\nsuch forums, the trend has been to push through certain\r\nideas without making adequate efforts to develop suitable\r\nconsensus at the universal level. An enhanced role for the\r\nSecurity Council, beyond the strict confines of the\r\nCharter, is not acceptable until its composition is\r\ngeographically representative and its decision-making is\r\nin accordance with the well-established norms of equality.\r\nBlurring of the boundaries between international\r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law, and the\r\nincreasing universalization and criminalization of\r\nviolations of human rights, gives rise to the imperative\r\nneed for such crimes to be defined with the same clarity,\r\nprecision and specificity required by criminal law.\r\nWe must, as we enter the new millennium, reflect on\r\nthe root causes that impede the emergence of a legal\r\ncommunity of mankind despite the evident physical and\r\npsychological interdependence that exists today and look\r\nfor solutions to rapidly eliminate negative factors or\r\nforces. This is a challenge which we all have to meet as\r\nAsian, African, American or European people, each\r\naccording to our capacity but with the same singular\r\ncommitment.\r\nMr. Hanson-Hall (Ghana): My delegation supports\r\nthe statement made by the representative of the Sudan on\r\nbehalf of the African Group and the statement made by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend Zimbabwe and\r\nthe Coordinating Bureau of the countries of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement for their initiative in the\r\ndeclaration of the period 1990-1999 as the United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nAs we mark the end of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law, we reflect on a period in which many\r\nsignificant developments have called into question the\r\nadequacy of contemporary principles of international law as\r\nwell as the rules of diplomacy and relations between States.\r\nWe have witnessed the demise of the cold war, the\r\nfragmentation of empires resulting in the birth of new\r\nnations and the dismantling of unjust political systems. At\r\nthe same time, armed conflicts proliferated while mankind\r\nwitnessed human catastrophes of unprecedented proportions.\r\nMeanwhile, the so-called new international order remains\r\nill-defined. All these factors have compelled the\r\nOrganization to search for new mechanisms to preserve\r\ninternational legality.\r\nIt is within this context that the significance of the\r\ndeclared purposes of the decade, as contained in resolution\r\n44/23 of 17 November 1989, should be viewed. On the\r\nwhole, the report of the Secretary-General contained in\r\ndocument A/54/362 shows that the programme has achieved\r\nsome successes in all the areas outlined. Notable among the\r\nsuccesses was the achievement of the objective of the\r\npromotion of means and methods for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes between States, including resort to,\r\nand full respect for, the International Court of Justice\r\nCommittee to which there is increasing recourse by States.\r\nThe allocation of additional resources to the Court shows\r\nthe determination of the entire membership of the\r\nOrganization to strengthen the Court as the world’s highest\r\njudicial body.\r\nMy delegation considers the establishment of the\r\nInternational Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and\r\nRwanda and the adoption of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court in Rome in July 1998 as welcome\r\ndevelopments in our collective effort to provide legal and\r\ninstitutional frameworks to hold perpetrators accountable for\r\ncrimes against humanity, war crimes, and serious violations\r\nof international humanitarian law. The full establishment of\r\nthe Court will underscore the determination of the\r\ninternational community to put an end to criminal impunity\r\nwherever it occurs. In this connection my delegation is\r\npleased to announce that Ghana ratified the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court on 11 November 1999 and\r\nsteps are being taken to deposit the instrument of\r\nratification with the Secretary-General.\r\nBy including the encouragement of the teaching, study,\r\ndissemination and wider appreciation of international law in\r\nthe purposes of the decade-long programme, the\r\nOrganization displayed great vision.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General demonstrates\r\nthat it is critical that the principles of international law be\r\nknown by policy makers, all Government functionaries\r\nand the judiciary.\r\nMy delegation considers the teaching of international\r\nlaw to youth as critical in strengthening its acceptance as\r\nthe foundation for the conduct of relations among nations\r\nfor the promotion of peace and security. We agree with\r\nthose who believe that studying abroad is an important\r\nmeans of widening one’s perspective and narrowing the\r\ngap to avoid future misunderstandings. In this regard, the\r\nteaching of international law continues to be an important\r\npart of the curricula of universities and other institutions.\r\nFurthermore, in his report to the Advisory\r\nCommittee on the United Nations Programme of\r\nAssistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and\r\nWider Appreciation of International Law, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral outlined a wide range of activities being\r\nundertaken. The extent of the activities is illustrated by\r\nthe range of the activities themselves, which include\r\nannual awards from voluntary funds to applicants for\r\nvarious fellowship programmes — seminars, courses and\r\npublications — not only of the United Nations but also of\r\nthe United Nations Institute for Training and Research\r\n(UNITAR) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO). These fellowship\r\nprogrammes include the Geneva International Law\r\nSeminar, which is held in conjunction with the annual\r\nsessions of the International Law Commission, the\r\nInternational Law Fellowship Programme, which is held\r\nat The Hague Academy of International Law in the\r\nNetherlands, and the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe\r\nMemorial Fellowship on the Law of the Sea, whose\r\nfellows study at participating universities and institutions.\r\nData indicate that over the past decade 242\r\nparticipants have benefitted from the Geneva International\r\nLaw Seminar and that 185 fellowships were also granted\r\nunder the International Law Fellowship Programme. Since\r\nits inception in 1965, 783 participants of 146 nationalities\r\nhave taken part in the Geneva International Law Seminar\r\nduring the sessions of the International Law Commission,\r\nwith 443 of them having received fellowships.\r\nWe have said before that despite this impressive\r\nnumber of fellowships awarded, many more applications\r\ncould not be favourably considered due to the lack of\r\nfunds. Consequently, with the demand for grants for the\r\nexecution of this Programme being far higher than the\r\nresources can support, the lack of financial resources is\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nhampering the greater achievement of the potential that\r\nexists under this Programme.\r\nDespite this resource constraint, the Advisory\r\nCommittee wishes to express its appreciation to all Member\r\nStates, organizations, universities, philanthropic foundations\r\nand other institutions that have contributed in diverse ways\r\nto make the implementation of various categories of the\r\nProgramme relatively successful. With the reasonably\r\nnotable successes achieved under the Programme, we hope\r\nthat States and organizations will feel encouraged to make\r\nmore voluntary contributions to make possible a higher\r\nlevel of achievement in promoting the noble ideals\r\nenvisaged under the Programme. We believe that it would\r\nbe beneficial to developing countries if UNITAR’s efforts\r\nunder the Programme could be enhanced.\r\nMy delegation also commends the Office of Legal\r\nAffairs for its efforts to bring up to date the United Nations\r\nTreaty Series and the United Nations Juridical Yearbook,\r\nas well as its efforts to place the Treaty Series and other\r\nlegal information on the Internet. In this regard, the\r\ntechnical details slowing down the efforts being made to\r\ncreate access to the Treaty Series electronic database should\r\nbe remedied. In addition, my delegation notes with\r\nappreciation the compilation of the United Nations audio-\r\nvisual library on international law, which covers very\r\nimportant areas of international law.\r\nAll in all, my delegation is gratified to note that\r\ndelegations to its thirty-fourth session unanimously\r\nadjudged the Advisory Committee’s Programme of\r\nAssistance an important component of United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law. It is heartening that the\r\nProgramme will continue in operation after the closure of\r\nthe Decade. It is indeed regrettable that such a programme\r\ncannot be expanded due to financial constraints. We\r\ncommend for the support of all delegations the guidelines\r\nand recommendations regarding the execution of the\r\nProgramme in the biennium 2000-2001 contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nAt this juncture, permit me to acknowledge the\r\nsignificant contribution made to the Programme by the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Committee (AALCC).\r\nThe AALCC has established itself as a major forum for\r\ninternational cooperation. The orientation of its work\r\nprogramme to meet the challenges posed by contemporary\r\ninternational society, especially within the framework of the\r\nactivities of the AALCC’s cooperation with the United\r\nNations, is enviable.\r\nMy delegation would like to thank the Governments\r\nof the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Russian\r\nFederation for the organization and the successful\r\ncelebration of the centennial of the first International\r\nPeace Conference. The active participation in the\r\ncentennial celebrations of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, was most gratifying and attests to the high priority\r\nattached to the rule of law in international law. My\r\ndelegation also recognizes the singular role played by the\r\nOffice of Legal Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat\r\nand the contributions of other dignitaries.\r\nMy delegation ventures to say that as we conclude\r\nthe celebration of the Decade we should remind ourselves\r\nabout the dangers facing United Nations staff members,\r\nboth at Headquarters and elsewhere, who undertake\r\ndangerous missions in order to foster international peace\r\nand security. Our attention has been drawn to the fact that\r\nduring the Decade several regular and locally recruited\r\nUnited Nations employees have been killed in the line of\r\nduty and that some staff members are still missing. My\r\ndelegation is convinced that if Member States were to\r\nundertake the sustained education of their citizens about\r\nthe important role United Nations employees play in our\r\ndesire to encourage the acceptance of the primacy of\r\ninternational law — and in particular if they gave\r\npractical effect to the Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel — greater respect for\r\nthe activities of the United Nations and its staff would be\r\nforthcoming more readily. To this end, we would like to\r\nemphasize that the United Nations will continue to be the\r\nconscience of mankind and the wheel around which\r\ninternational law will revolve. My delegation therefore\r\nencourages all Member States to show commitment to the\r\nideals of the Organization in order to strengthen the\r\nrespect for the rule of international law.\r\nMr. Franco (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): It is a\r\ntrue honour for my delegation to participate in this debate\r\nto share some observations regarding the United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law. Colombia participated in the\r\npreparation of the visionary evaluation given by the\r\ndelegation of Mexico on behalf of the Rio Group, as well\r\nas in the thoughtful presentation made by the delegation\r\nof South Africa on behalf of the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries. We therefore associate ourselves with\r\nthe contents of both statements.\r\nDuring the general debate on 20 September 1999,\r\nthe President of the Republic of Colombia, Andrés\r\nPastrana, highlighted one of the central elements that best\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nillustrates how my country views its international relations\r\nby saying that\r\n“Colombia is not a military or economic power.\r\nNonetheless, it is respected by the community of\r\nnations for its unlimited and unconditional support for\r\nthe norms and principles of international law.”\r\n(A/54/PV.5, p. 11)\r\nThe consideration of the agenda item entitled “United\r\nNations Decade of International Law” at a time of such\r\ncomplexity for the international community compels us to\r\nreflect on the validity, relevance and significance of the\r\ngeneral principles of international law, because these\r\nprinciples are a sine qua non for the peaceful coexistence\r\nof nations.\r\nIt bears repeating time and time again, in all\r\ninternational, multilateral and bilateral forums, that there is\r\na real need for strict compliance with every one of the\r\ngeneral principles of law enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. More than ever before, our community of\r\nnations must accept this commitment by respecting justice\r\nand order, and by harmonizing the moral commitments of\r\nour Governments with the political realities that they may\r\nface domestically and internationally.\r\nWe take the unique opportunity offered by this\r\ncommemoration to call on those Governments that in one\r\nway or another may not be basing their actions on these\r\nprinciples to begin to do so without delay and in every\r\ncircumstance. The people of Colombia are convinced of the\r\nnegative consequences of State action that is not in\r\naccordance with these minimum guidelines of behaviour,\r\nwhich the community of nations has accepted as the\r\nfoundation of international peace and security. Respect for\r\nthe general principles of law is a sign of democracy,\r\npluralism and respect for individual human rights.\r\nThe principle of pacta sunt servanda cannot be\r\nignored by any State under any circumstance. Naturally,\r\nColombia complies strictly and in good faith with those\r\ninternational obligations that it has accepted. Consequently,\r\nwe expect other States also to comply in good faith with\r\nthe international obligations they have assumed in the\r\ncontext of multilateral or bilateral negotiations. This kind of\r\nbehaviour must be mandatory in dealing with all issues, be\r\nthey security- or trade-related, in bilateral and multilateral\r\nforums. Rejection of this principle would be tantamount to\r\nenabling the gradual establishment of an international\r\nsystem based on anarchy and insecurity. It would also\r\nfacilitate the consolidation of a system of relations without\r\nrules in which the behaviour of other Governments would\r\nbe unpredictable, indecisive and erratic.\r\nCompliance with, and strict respect for, the principle\r\nof non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States\r\nis the basis of all international relations. Regrettably, there\r\nhave been many recent examples of violations of this\r\nprinciple. In some cases, powerful nations have ignored\r\nit; in other instances, smaller States have intervened in the\r\ndomestic affairs of other States. The truth of the matter is\r\nthat, regardless of who champions this approach,\r\nunquestionably the good intentions underlying an\r\nintervention have the potential of leading to bad results.\r\nBy complying with the two general principles I\r\nreferred to earlier, we will also strengthen the United\r\nNations. However, there are other principles that we\r\nshould not overlook. These include good-neighbourliness\r\nand friendly relations among nations; the non-use of force\r\nin international relations in violation of the sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of States; the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes; the independence and sovereign equality of\r\nStates; and the right of peoples to self-determination.\r\nGeneral principles are at the heart of peaceful\r\ncoexistence among nations. They are valid for all\r\nsocieties because they were devised, and are applied, with\r\nthe very nature of the human individual in mind. These\r\nprinciples do not belong to a particular legal system but\r\nto all of them. They are values of international protection\r\nthat are reflected in several international treaties that\r\nColombia considers to be most useful.\r\nWith these brief comments we have tried to show\r\nthat we must avoid the temptation of viewing the Decade\r\nas the end of a process. Instead, this moment should be\r\nregarded as the beginning of an effort to build an\r\ninternational society of nations. Now is the time to\r\nimplement the international rules of law that the 188\r\nStates Members of the Organization have adopted as the\r\nnorms, standards, principles, institutions and procedures\r\nthat make up international public law.\r\nMr. Mangoaela (Lesotho): My delegation fully\r\nassociates itself with the statements made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Sudan on behalf of the African\r\nGroup; the representative of South Africa on behalf of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement; and the representative of\r\nMozambique on behalf of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nThe United Nations Decade of International Law,\r\nwhose closure we are commemorating today, has coincided\r\nwith a momentous period in international affairs. There\r\nhave been significant achievements, but it must be\r\nacknowledged that in the course of the Decade there have\r\nbeen terrible disasters — wars and internal conflicts that\r\nreflect the continued deficiency in the development of, and\r\nadherence to, international law. As we commemorate the\r\nprogress of this important Decade — and there have been\r\nextraordinary achievements — we must also reflect on the\r\ngreat amount of work which must still be done to achieve\r\nthe noble goals of the Charter.\r\nThe main purposes of the Decade, as reflected in\r\nresolution 44/23, were, inter alia, to promote acceptance\r\nand respect for the principles of international law; to\r\npromote means and methods for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes between States, including resort to and full respect\r\nfor the International Court of Justice; to encourage the\r\nprogressive development of international law and its\r\ncodification; and to encourage the teaching, study,\r\ndissemination and wider appreciation of international law.\r\nThe Decade was the initiative of the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries, and we should express our\r\nappreciation to the Movement, in particular to the then\r\nChairman, Zimbabwe, and to Foreign Minister Shamuyarira,\r\nwho provided vital vision and leadership in 1989. My\r\ndelegation would also like to express its sincere\r\nappreciation to the Government of the Russian Federation\r\nand to that of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for\r\nco-hosting the centennial celebrations of the International\r\nPeace Conference. The centennial and related forums\r\nprovided substantive evaluation of the progress of\r\ninternational law during the past century and identified\r\nessential goals which must be achieved in the next.\r\nThe centennial process adopted the themes of the 1899\r\nConference: the question of armaments, the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, the laws of war and humanitarian\r\nlaw. It must be noted that the great hopes and aims of the\r\n1899 and 1907 Hague Peace Conferences were not realized\r\nin the twentieth century, which has been the bloodiest and\r\nmost war-ridden in all of human history.\r\nDuring the past 100 years, in particular during the past\r\ndecade, the peaceful settlement of disputes has been the\r\nexception rather than the rule. Acceptance of the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\r\nremains a distant goal; respect for the World Court’s\r\ndecisions is essential if the next century is to be more\r\npeaceful and lawful. The goal of the 1899 Conference of\r\nlimiting the production of armaments has also gone\r\nunrealized. Instead, this century has witnessed the\r\ndevelopment and proliferation of the most destructive\r\nweapons imaginable. For five decades, the world\r\ncommunity has lived with the threat of annihilation. The\r\nhopes that the end of the cold war would usher in a\r\nperiod of unparalleled cooperation and progress have not\r\nbeen supported by the stagnation of negotiations and the\r\ndevelopment and testing of new weapons by some\r\nnations.\r\nAs we approach the end of the twentieth century, the\r\nworld community is horrified that this century has\r\nwitnessed the tendency for civilians to become the main\r\nvictims of war. We have witnessed the escalation of the\r\nuse of children as soldiers and the devastating use of\r\nweapons, such as landmines, which slaughter more\r\nvictims — almost all of them civilians — after the\r\ncessation of war than during the hostilities.\r\nFor Africa, especially my country’s region of\r\nsouthern Africa, these failures have been profoundly\r\ndevastating. Conflict and strife, now mostly internal,\r\ncontinue to engulf the African continent. It is not weapons\r\nof mass destruction, but small arms which are causing the\r\ngreatest suffering, instability and loss of life. Africa\r\ncannot emerge from its terrible economic and political\r\nturmoil unless respect for international humanitarian law\r\nis enforced in the new century. In this sense, the purposes\r\nand goals of the Decade have had the greatest relevance\r\nfor my country and my region.\r\nAlthough our journey has been long and painful,\r\nmajor strides have been taken during this fateful century.\r\nDuring the past decade alone, important new international\r\nlaws and regimes have been established and have come\r\ninto force, protecting the oceans, the air and water; trying\r\nto achieve for the next generation the goal of stopping the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons; outlawing the\r\ndevelopment of other weapons of mass destruction;\r\nadvancing human rights, regional security and\r\ncooperation; and confronting terrorism, drug trafficking\r\nand other forms of organized crime.\r\nThe adoption of the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court has been hailed as the\r\ngreatest advance in the rule of law since the adoption of\r\nthe United Nations Charter. My country and region are\r\ncommitted to its ratification and early entry into force.\r\nThis new world Court, and the complementary system of\r\ninternational justice that it will anchor, provides one of\r\nhumanity’s best hopes that millions of lives in the next\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\ncentury will be spared the devastation and horrible suffering\r\nexperienced during the past 100 years.\r\nThe United Nations cycle of world conferences and\r\nsummits — the largest gatherings of nations, leaders, treaty\r\nbodies and civil society in history — has coincided with the\r\nDecade of International Law. The Secretary-General has\r\nreinforced these processes with agendas for peace,\r\ndevelopment and democracy. The agendas, plans of action\r\nand new international laws emerging from these historic\r\nconferences and processes offer the vision and step-by-step\r\ngoals which, if implemented, will guide the international\r\ncommunity towards the most secure and sustainable\r\ninternational legal order that the world has ever known.\r\nOne of the most extraordinary conferences — the Hague\r\nAppeal for Peace Conference — was convened not by the\r\nUnited Nations, but by non-governmental organizations of\r\ncivil society. The report on the centennial Conference, in\r\ndocument A/54/381, notes the close cooperation between\r\nthe organizers of the centennial celebrations and the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, whose 10,000 delegates from\r\n1,000 organizations, countries and international\r\norganizations put forward the Hague Agenda for Peace and\r\nJustice in the Twenty-first Century.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General in document\r\nA/54/362 outlines substantial achievements in the\r\nencouragement of the teaching, study, dissemination and\r\nwider appreciation of international law. A great thinker\r\nonce described history as a race between education and\r\ndisaster. It is vital that all sectors of the world community\r\nbetter understand the importance and role of international\r\nlaw. Thus, we commend the efforts made during the\r\nDecade to expand the knowledge and training of educators,\r\nyoung people, parliamentarians, the media and others. It is\r\nindeed important that in addressing the objective of the\r\nprogressive development of international law, as well as its\r\nteaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation, we\r\ndo not forget those who are not part of these negotiations\r\nbut who are strongly affected by them: the younger\r\ngeneration, which is still groping for a stable concept in an\r\never-more rapidly changing world. Today’s youths are\r\ntomorrow’s leaders. Hence, it is through our strong and\r\nsincere efforts today to engage them that the goal of the\r\nwider knowledge of international law among Governments,\r\nnational administrations and the judiciary can be achieved\r\ntomorrow. We thus commend the United Nations and the\r\nOffice of Legal Affairs for their efforts to extend access to\r\nits treaties and processes via the United Nations Internet\r\nServices.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report, in documenting the\r\nsignificant progress achieved in the development and\r\ncodification of international law, notes the important work\r\nwhich is being done by the International Law\r\nCommission and, increasingly, by the Sixth Committee.\r\nThe enhancement of the legislative role of the Sixth\r\nCommittee may be one of the least known, but most\r\nsignificant, achievements of the Decade and one of the\r\nmost important ways in which the General Assembly is\r\nimproving its effectiveness and accountability.\r\nMy country welcomes the advances in the promotion\r\nof means and methods for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes which have been made during the Decade.\r\nTribunals to settle disputes relating to the law of the sea\r\nand to trade have begun; and two Tribunals to address\r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity have been\r\nestablished.\r\nEnhancing support for the International Court of\r\nJustice was a key goal of the originators of the Decade.\r\nThe International Court of Justice is the principal judicial\r\nbody of the international legal order; it is as unique as it\r\nis universal. The acceptance of the jurisdiction of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice by powerful and weak\r\nnations alike is perhaps the world’s best measure of the\r\nacceptance of the rule of law in international affairs. The\r\n“opt in, opt out” treatment of the Court and its decisions\r\nby some nations reflects the precarious state of\r\ninternational law. The rights of sovereignty cannot excuse\r\nimpunity under fundamental international legal principles\r\nand laws.\r\nIn this regard, my country notes with optimism the\r\nincreased use of the International Court of Justice in\r\nrecent years. Growing confidence in the International\r\nCourt of Justice is evident in its increasing role in global\r\nissues, such as the legality of the use of force, genocide,\r\nreprisals, maritime delimitation and territorial questions.\r\nWe take special note of the Court’s Advisory Opinion on\r\nthe Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, for\r\nin no other matter is the stark contrast between the choice\r\nof war and peace more clear. The opposite of mutual\r\nassured destruction is the just rule of law in international\r\naffairs. This was at the heart of the purpose of the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law, and our\r\ncommitment to this goal must not end with the closure of\r\nthe Decade. For the International Court of Justice to\r\ndevelop to its full potential, it is necessary that a greater\r\nnumber of countries, especially those that are in position\r\nto be world leaders in the next millennium, resort to its\r\njurisdiction and respect its decisions. With the added\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nconfidence in the International Court of Justice comes the\r\nobligation to ensure adequate resources and improvements\r\nin working conditions for the Court, relative to its\r\nexpanding global importance.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation thanks the\r\nSecretary-General for his report and supports the call for it\r\nto be disseminated as widely as possible. For us, today’s\r\ncommemoration offered an opportunity for genuine\r\nreflection on and rededication to the noble principles of the\r\nDecade.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Over the past 10 years we have\r\nobserved an increasing acceptance of the rule of law as the\r\ngoverning principle in relations between States. Likewise,\r\nthe body of international law has been strengthened by the\r\nadoption of several ground-breaking instruments such as the\r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nNorway welcomes the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe United Nations Decade of International Law. Norway\r\nfurther welcomes the outcome of this year’s celebrations of\r\nthe centennial of the first International Peace Conference.\r\nIn particular, we would like to congratulate the Government\r\nof the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of\r\nthe Russian Federation for their efforts to arrange the\r\nmeetings that took place at The Hague and at Saint\r\nPetersburg. They constituted a major contribution to the\r\nappropriate commemoration of the 1899 Peace Conference.\r\nAs to the agenda of the centennial, the issues are no less\r\nimportant today than they were 100 years ago: they are\r\nissues of disarmament and demobilization, humanitarian law\r\nand the laws of war, and the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes.\r\nWith respect to humanitarian law, we share the view\r\nthat priority should be given to promoting compliance with\r\nexisting law rather than to adopting a number of new\r\ninstruments — although some development of existing law\r\nremains desirable in some important fields. Continued\r\nefforts must at this stage be directed at activating national\r\nsignature and ratification procedures to secure the early\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court. The\r\nexistence of a permanent global institution of that kind will\r\nsignificantly enhance deterrence against the most heinous\r\ninternational crimes. It will be significant not least in\r\nreducing the reaction time of the international community\r\nas compared to that involved in establishing new ad hoc\r\ntribunals. Norway’s preparations are well under way with\r\na view to prior parliamentary approval of ratification.\r\nOn the threshold of a new century, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has submitted a timely and comprehensive report\r\non the protection of civilians in armed conflict\r\n(S/1999/957). We welcome this addressing of a dimension\r\nof humanitarian law which regrettably requires more\r\nattention than ever. It seems fundamental that the United\r\nNations and the international community must remain\r\nseized of the challenging task of pursuing means to\r\nprevent conflicts, and pending success, of ensuring the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict, including\r\ncompliance with the essential principles and rules of\r\nconduct of armed conflict contained in, inter alia, the\r\nGeneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional\r\nProtocols of 1977.\r\nWithin this context, the safety of United Nations\r\npersonnel is a critical issue. We welcome the entry into\r\nforce in January this year of the 1994 Convention on the\r\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. The\r\nConvention represents a major contribution to this cause.\r\nWe encourage more States to commit themselves to the\r\nConvention. In this context we would like to touch also\r\nupon the question of the applicability of international\r\nhumanitarian law in United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. Norway supports the general idea of\r\nguidelines for peacekeepers. However, we are of the\r\nopinion that the guidelines published by the Secretariat\r\nthrough the Secretary-General’s bulletin need further\r\nstudy and consultations before they are ripe for\r\nimplementation in peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe promotion of means and methods for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States, including\r\nresort to and full respect for the International Court of\r\nJustice, was in our view a core purpose of the Decade of\r\nInternational Law. The International Court of Justice is\r\nthe principal international judicial body and possesses a\r\nunique competence and universality. The Court\r\ncontributes considerably to the settlement of international\r\ndisputes as well as to the interpretation and development\r\nof international law. During the past decade there has\r\nbeen an increase in the number of cases brought before\r\nthe Court. We welcome that development while\r\nacknowledging the financial constraints of the Court.\r\nNorway is pleased to learn that the Advisory Committee\r\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions has given\r\nfavourable consideration to the budgetary request\r\nconcerning the Court.\r\nNorway urges all States to take advantage of the\r\ncompetence of the International Court of Justice. That\r\ncourt and other international judicial institutions are\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\ncornerstones of an international community built on respect\r\nfor treaties and the rule of law. Moreover, we must ensure\r\nthat the Decade’s achievements in consolidating an orderly\r\nlaw-based international system are carried on into the next\r\ncentury.\r\nRecently, the issue of humanitarian intervention\r\ninvolving the use of force has been a matter of public\r\ndebate. In academic publications there have been attempts\r\nto develop new doctrines of humanitarian intervention to\r\njustify the use of armed force outside the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Such attempts are a matter of\r\nserious concern to us. We fear that introducing new\r\ndoctrines of humanitarian intervention could be hazardous.\r\nIt could easily lead us away from an international order\r\nfounded on international law towards one based on power\r\npolitics. We fear that might — the prerogative of the\r\nstrong — could come to replace right. We fear also that\r\nnew doctrines on humanitarian intervention may be misused\r\nto legitimize aggression. This could be highly detrimental\r\nto the security interests of small States such as Norway.\r\nHistory has also repeatedly shown the need to be extremely\r\ncautious about using new doctrines to justify military\r\nintervention in the name of overriding necessity.\r\nAwareness of the vital interplay between the\r\ninternational protection of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms on the one hand, and measures to maintain or\r\nrestore international peace and security on the other is\r\ngaining ground. This is also manifest in the Security\r\nCouncil’s response to the conflicts of the 1990s. In the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, Somalia, Rwanda and East Timor the\r\nCouncil has invoked Chapter VII of the United Nations\r\nCharter to react to gross violations of human rights, to\r\ngrave breaches of humanitarian law, to crimes against\r\nhumanity and to acts of genocide.\r\nThus, throughout this decade, the practice of the\r\nSecurity Council establishes beyond any doubt that when\r\nfaced with such massive crimes, the Council may act under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter and decide on measures to\r\nmaintain or restore international peace and security. The\r\nestablishment of the ad hoc tribunals for the former\r\nYugoslavia and for Rwanda, the Security Council’s\r\nmanagement of the situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand in Kosovo and its authorization of the use of armed\r\nforce in Somalia are pertinent cases in point. As these\r\nexamples illustrate, such measures may be peaceful, but\r\nthey may also involve the threat or use of force.\r\nIn addition, international law allows for a broad range\r\nof peaceful responses to serious violations of human rights\r\nor other standards of humanity. Recourse by a State or a\r\ngroup of States to such mechanisms would never amount\r\nto interference in matters which are essentially within the\r\ndomestic jurisdiction of the State at fault or to\r\ninfringement of its sovereignty.\r\nWe are convinced that the threat or use of force in\r\ninternational relations must have a legal basis in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. A difficult humanitarian\r\nsituation may be part of the Security Council’s assessment\r\nof whether a situation constitutes a threat to international\r\npeace and security. It is, however, not in itself a sufficient\r\nlegal basis for employing the threat or use of force. We\r\ntherefore fully concur with the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, who in his important address in The Hague\r\non 18 May 1999 eloquently summed up the challenge that\r\nconfronts us in the following way.\r\n“Unless the Security Council is restored to its\r\npreeminent position as the sole source of\r\nlegitimacy on the use of force, we are on a\r\ndangerous path to anarchy... But equally\r\nimportant, unless the Security Council can\r\nunite around the aim of confronting massive\r\nhuman rights violations and crimes against\r\nhumanity on the scale of Kosovo, then we will\r\nbetray the very ideals that inspired the founding\r\nof the United Nations.”\r\nWe do not find the concept of humanitarian\r\nintervention to be particularly useful in a constructive\r\ndiscourse on the crucial but highly difficult question\r\nraised by the Secretary-General.\r\nMr. Shobokshi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nFor over five decades, since the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations, this Organization has assumed\r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. The activities undertaken by the Organization to\r\nachieve that goal have covered many fields, including\r\nhuman rights, disarmament, outer space, economic\r\ndevelopment, international trade, crime prevention and\r\ncriminal justice, the environment, fighting terrorism and\r\nthe establishment of an International Criminal Court. As\r\na result of all those activities, many relevant resolutions\r\nand decisions have been adopted by various United\r\nNations organs. The General Assembly, in its resolution\r\n44/23 of 17 November 1989, proclaimed the period 1990-\r\n1999 the United Nations Decade of International Law, the\r\npurposes of which include promoting acceptance of the\r\nprinciples of international law and respect for\r\ninternational law by strengthening acceptance of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nmultilateral treaties and providing technical assistance and\r\nadvice to States to facilitate their accession to such\r\nmultilateral treaties.\r\nAlso among the purposes of the Decade was the\r\nencouragement of peaceful settlement of disputes among\r\nStates by providing opportunities for States and\r\ninternational organizations to express their views and to\r\nmake proposals in order to find the most effective means\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes. Another major\r\npurpose of the Decade was to encourage the progressive\r\ndevelopment, teaching, study and codification of\r\ninternational law. The programmes offered by the world\r\nOrganization to teach and disseminate international law\r\ncover many areas, including offering fellowships and\r\nholding seminars on international law, such as those held in\r\nGeneva. In addition, States promote the teaching of\r\ninternational law at all levels of education and organize\r\nseminars, conferences, workshops and relevant lectures at\r\nthe national, regional and international levels. All this\r\nunderlines the importance attached to international law by\r\nthe Organization and the genuine desire of States to\r\npromote a wider appreciation of it.\r\nOn this occasion, my delegation wishes to stress the\r\nneed to maintain and extend this exercise beyond the time-\r\nframe of the Decade so that the expected goals of the\r\nDecade can be achieved. Furthermore, we would like to pay\r\ntribute to the role undertaken by the United Nations through\r\nits Office of Legal Affairs to supervise the international\r\nlegal Web site which the United Nations has set up to make\r\navailable and update information on its programmes and\r\nfunctions in many areas, including the United Nations\r\nTreaty Collection, international trade law, the codification\r\nand progressive development of international law and the\r\nInternational Law Commission and its updating. My\r\ndelegation would like to pay tribute to the United Nations\r\nfor establishing a new Web site this year devoted to the\r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We also\r\npay tribute to the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs\r\nfor the guide published in 1997 on international\r\nenvironmental law.\r\nA few months ago, we celebrated the centennial of the\r\nfirst International Peace Conference. Today we observe the\r\nend of the United Nations Decade of International Law. It\r\nis our hope that peace and security will prevail throughout\r\nthe world and that, learning from the horrors of the past,\r\nparties will resolve all their disputes by peaceful means.\r\nThis hope highlights the need to respect the resolutions and\r\ndecisions adopted by the United Nations so that these noble\r\npurposes and principles can be fulfilled.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has supported and\r\nwill continue to support any efforts and international\r\nendeavours aimed at achieving the purposes of the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law. On this occasion,\r\nwe call upon other delegations to work, under the\r\nconstantly changing conditions of our world, towards\r\nachieving those purposes and unifying and coordinating\r\nefforts so that optimum results can be attained.\r\nToday we observe the end of the United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law, during which conventions\r\nand protocols have been adopted in many areas. Many are\r\nstill being debated and negotiated. Efforts by the United\r\nNations to encourage peaceful methods and means for\r\nsettling disputes among States, achievements made in the\r\nprogressive development and codification of international\r\nlaw and the encouragement of its study, teaching and\r\nwider appreciation — all these demonstrate the relevance\r\nof the United Nations endeavour to fulfil the purposes of\r\nthe Decade. This endeavour acquires even greater\r\nsignificance as we stand at the threshold of a new\r\ncentury, which we hope will see closer and more\r\nharmonious international relations analogous to the\r\nbreakthroughs in the fields of science and technology.\r\nThese efforts by the United Nations should be\r\nmatched by increased international commitment to the\r\nprovisions of instruments aimed at permanent security,\r\npeace and progress for all peoples of the world.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (French): First of all,\r\nI would like to associate myself with the statements made\r\nby Mr. Omer Mohamed of the Sudan on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Group and by Ambassador Dumisana Kumalo of\r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe United Nations Decade of International Law,\r\nestablished under resolution 44/23 of 17 November 1989,\r\nis coming to an end. My delegation, like so many others,\r\nwould like to participate in this very special event by\r\nsharing with the Assembly a few thoughts.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nFirst of all, it is fitting and essential to recognize the\r\ncontribution of international law to the elaboration of an\r\ninternational society in which, whether we wish it or not,\r\nthe role of the law is daily becoming more predominant\r\nthan that of force. From Grotius to Jellinek, from\r\nAnzilotti to Kelsen and Duguit, from Poulanzas to our\r\neminent internationalists on the International Law\r\nCommission — they all shared in designing the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\ncontemporary positive law that governs international life.\r\nTheir efforts and good qualities are certainly praiseworthy,\r\nbut in the context of an ever-changing world, the\r\ncodification of international law is like Penelope’s cloth,\r\nforever being woven with no hope of completion.\r\nThat is why the United Nations, in embracing such a\r\ngigantic enterprise, conferred it on distinguished experts\r\nwhose work in the International Law Commission is\r\nuniversally lauded. This is also why the United Nations\r\ndeclared a Decade of International Law, with four main\r\nobjectives: to promote acceptance of and respect for the\r\nprinciples of international law; to promote means and\r\nmethods for the peaceful settlement of disputes between\r\nStates, including resort to and full respect for the\r\nInternational Court of Justice; to encourage the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law and its codification; and\r\nto encourage the teaching, study, dissemination and wider\r\nappreciation of international law.\r\nThe commemoration of the end of the United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law naturally raises the question of\r\nwhat it has achieved. Where do we stand?\r\nFrom this point of view, we would like first of all to\r\nexpress our pleasure at the major achievements noted in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. Major advances in various\r\nimportant areas of international law have been observed.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report makes it possible to\r\nassess the Decade’s achievements from two perspectives.\r\nFirst, from the point of view of the activities of States, the\r\nDecade was marked, inter alia, by the promotion of the\r\nacceptance of and respect for the principles of international\r\nlaw through participation and involvement in the drafting\r\nand implementation of multilateral treaties; the promotion\r\nof means and methods for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes between States, which is seen in the number of\r\ncases brought before the International Court of Justice or\r\nbefore arbitration bodies; the promotion of the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law through intensive bilateral\r\nand multilateral efforts to regulate international relations;\r\nand the encouragement of the teaching, study and\r\ndissemination of international law, inter alia, by means of\r\neducational programmes, United Nations assistance for\r\ntraining — particularly under the auspices of the United\r\nNations Institute for Training and Research — and the\r\npublication of documents.\r\nWith respect to the activities of the United Nations to\r\npromote the progressive development of international law,\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General cites codification efforts\r\nin such important areas as human rights, disarmament,\r\nouter space, economic development, international trade,\r\nthe prevention of crime, penal justice, environment and\r\nthe law of the sea.\r\nBurkina Faso is thus quite right in regarding the\r\nbottomline as positive, though there remain issues on\r\nwhich the international community could enhance its\r\nefforts. In many respects and as regards several issues,\r\nthe developing countries have been treated as mere extras\r\nin the precess of drafting multilateral treaties. Therefore,\r\nassistance and technical advice to States should be\r\nincreased, according to States’ level of development, so\r\nas to allow them to participate more easily in the drafting\r\nof multilateral treaties. Similarly, training and education\r\nprogrammes in the field of international law should be\r\nincreased.\r\nWithout wishing in any way to diminish the\r\nimportance of other issues raised within the context of the\r\nDecade, Burkina Faso nonetheless gives special priority\r\nto two particular aspects: the teaching, study and\r\ndissemination of a wider appreciation of international law,\r\nand the provision of assistance and technical advice to\r\nStates so that they can participate more easily in the\r\nprocess of drafting multilateral treaties. In our view, these\r\ntwo objectives could help enhance the aptitude, the\r\ncapacity and the involvement of States in the field of\r\ninternational law, because working to enhance the\r\ncapacity of States is a means of increasing the acceptance\r\nof, understanding of and respect for international law.\r\nThe Decade is coming to a close, but it has\r\nindisputably created a momentum that must endure. The\r\nconsiderations it has brought forth must continue to guide\r\nour Organization and its Member States in their activities,\r\nbecause much remains to be done in implementing and\r\nenhancing respect for the many instruments that have\r\nbeen adopted, in regard to condification in new areas and\r\nin regard to the willingness to have recourse to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and to arbitration bodies and\r\nto respect their decisions.\r\nAll human activities are perfectable, and the results\r\nof the Decade should allow us to aim even higher and\r\nmore accurately.\r\nIt is my firm conviction that if we remain committed\r\nto continuing our activities aimed at attaining the\r\nobjectives of the Decade, together we will be able to\r\nbuild an international society that is more harmonious,\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nfairer and, consequently, more capable of meeting the\r\nchallenges of our times.\r\nMr. Tudela (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru supports\r\nthe statement made this morning by the delegation of\r\nMexico on behalf of the Rio Group and the statement made\r\nby South Africa on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nA decade has passed since 17 November 1989, when\r\nthe General Assembly declared 1990-1999 as the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law, in order to promote\r\nthe acceptance of and respect for the principles of\r\ninternational law to promote means and methods for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States, to encourage\r\nthe codification of international law and, lastly, to\r\nencourage the teaching, study, dissemination and wider\r\nappreciation of international law.\r\nWith respect to promoting the acceptance of and\r\nrespect for the principles of international law, we note a\r\nsignificant increase in the number of legal instruments in\r\nforce, as well as a greater number of States parties to each\r\nof them. Peru, in keeping with its traditional attachment to\r\ninternational law, has also taken part in this process.\r\nWe are pleased that resort to the International Court of\r\nJustice is becoming more frequent, and we urge all States\r\ninvolved in disputes not to stop trying to find negotiated,\r\npeaceful solutions to them.\r\nWith respect to the promotion of the study,\r\ndissemination and wider appreciation of international law,\r\nthe use of computers and the Internet have been extremely\r\nvaluable. In this regard we commend the Codification\r\nDivision of the Secretariat for its important and vigorous\r\nwork in placing on the Internet both the Treaty Series and\r\nother important legal instruments. In this context, we\r\nwelcome in particular the recent opening of a site that\r\noffers specific information on the topics currently being\r\ndealt with by the Sixth Committee.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the continuation of\r\ninternational law programmes and seminars being organized\r\nin various countries and, in particular, the annual\r\nfellowships to the Geneva International Law Seminar, the\r\nInternational Law Fellowship programme at The Hague and\r\nthe Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial Fellowship.\r\nWe hope that the donor countries will continue to support\r\nthese programmes, which are an important educational tool.\r\nAll of these activities are a source of satisfaction to\r\nPeru. Nonetheless, serious doubts remain about the role of\r\ninternational law in the future, not only for the\r\nOrganization but also for international relations as a\r\nwhole. We have reached the end of the century and many\r\nwonder about the future. We will not venture to provide\r\nan answer, but we do believe that the maintenance of\r\npeace and friendly relations among Member States will\r\ndepend largely on how this question is resolved.\r\nInternational law emerges as the embodiment of a\r\nlegal norm accepted by States. Thus, it will be effective\r\nonly if this desire is supported by the political will of\r\nStates to adhere to this order. As a result, we are deeply\r\nconcerned by the possibility that, instead of an effort to\r\nshape an inter-State opinio juris to develop legally\r\nbinding provisions, an attempt should be made to apply\r\nideological dogma, a pseudo-declarative international law.\r\nBefore concluding, we wish to convey our gratitude\r\nto the Governments of the Netherlands and the Russian\r\nFederation for having prepared the commemoration of the\r\ncentennial of the First International Peace Conference in\r\nThe Hague, in which both nations played a major role.\r\nThis was an historic occasion at which the international\r\ncommunity met to promote law as an effective means of\r\npreserving the stability of the international system, thus\r\nlaying the cornerstone of contemporary international law\r\nand its subsequent development.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The representative of the Sudan spoke on behalf\r\nof the States of the Organization of African Unity, while\r\nthe representative of South Africa spoke on behalf of the\r\nStates members of the Non-Aligned Movement. My\r\ncountry is a member of both organizations. I endorse their\r\nstatements and wish to add the following.\r\nOn this day, as we mark the end of the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law, we feel that this is\r\nan appropriate opportunity to assess the achievements\r\nmade in the course of the Decade in codifying and\r\nstrengthening international law and to review the\r\nobstacles that have hindered the implementation of the\r\nspecific objectives set out in General Assembly resolution\r\n44/23 of 17 November 1989. These objectives include,\r\ninter alia, the promotion of the acceptance of and respect\r\nfor the principles of international law; the promotion of\r\nmeans and methods for the peaceful settlement of disputes\r\nbetween States; the encouragement of the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law and its codification; and\r\nthe encouragement of the teaching, study, dissemination\r\nand wider appreciation of international law.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nWe note the important progress achieved in the course\r\nof the past 10 years in the progressive development of\r\ninternational law. Several conventions and international\r\ninstruments have been adopted, including the Rome Statute\r\nof the International Criminal Court and the elaboration of\r\nan international convention for the suppression of terrorist\r\nbombings. The International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea has been established as one of the mechanisms of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A\r\nnumber of conferences, seminars and workshops have been\r\norganized. All this highlights the broad achievement of one\r\nof the main objectives of the Decade: the encouragement of\r\nthe teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of\r\ninternational law.\r\nOur delegation wishes to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress its full appreciation of the work undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations Office of Legal Affairs and its efforts to\r\nfacilitate access to information on the activities of the\r\nOrganization in the field of international law, particularly\r\nthe posting on the Internet of the United Nations Treaty\r\nSeries and the Advisory Opinions of the International Court\r\nof Justice. We look forward to that Office’s redoubling its\r\nefforts to make all its publications in that field, including\r\nthe United Nations Juridical Yearbook, accessible in all the\r\nofficial languages of the United Nations.\r\nOne of the objectives of the Decade was to promote\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through resort to United\r\nNations mechanisms, particularly the International Court of\r\nJustice. It is indeed satisfying to note that the Decade has\r\nwitnessed recourse to the Court by an increasing number of\r\nStates, my country among them. We have resorted to the\r\nCourt on more than one occasion in order to settle several\r\nboundary-demarcation disputes with our neighbours and\r\nhave faithfully implemented its judgments, including those\r\nnot in our favour. We have done so out of respect for\r\ninternational law and our commitment to implementing all\r\nthe decisions of this principal judicial mechanism of the\r\nUnited Nations. We believe that the International Court of\r\nJustice is the central point of reference for the international\r\ncommunity in interpreting international law. My country\r\nhas resorted to the Court once again to settle its dispute\r\nwith the United States of America and the United Kingdom\r\nover the Pan Am 103 incident over Lockerbie. We consider\r\nthis dispute to be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, in accordance with\r\ninternational law.\r\nOur celebration today underscores once again the\r\nimportance attached by the international community to the\r\nstrengthening and development of international law.\r\nUnfortunately, despite the passage of 10 years since the\r\ndeclaration of the Decade and of 100 years since the First\r\nInternational Peace Conference, which laid the\r\nfoundations for the establishment of many rules of\r\ninternational law, the international community has yet to\r\nachieve full compliance with and respect for these rules,\r\nparticularly in the field of the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes between States. Some States have resorted to the\r\nuse of force to settle their disputes, while others have\r\nresorted to international mechanisms, especially the\r\nSecurity Council, to impose sanctions before all attempts\r\nto settle these disputes peacefully have been exhausted, as\r\nthe Charter dictates that they should. The international\r\ncommunity has failed to end such practices, which\r\ncontravene international law and the objectives of the\r\nDecade.\r\nIn several instances, these practices and laws have\r\ntranscended regional boundaries, such as the Helms-\r\nBurton and D’Amato-Kennedy Acts, promulgated by the\r\nUnited States Congress and applied by the United States\r\nGovernment against individuals and entities of other\r\nStates, and which it threatens to apply against other States\r\nand persons if they deal with States that stand up to the\r\nUnited States attempts to impose hegemony.\r\nWhile fully realizing that most members of the\r\ninternational community have repeatedly stated their\r\nrejection of such practices, we believe that today, as we\r\nmark the conclusion of the Decade, the international\r\ncommunity has the opportunity to reaffirm its intention to\r\nadopt all the measures necessary to do away with such\r\nlaws because they contravene the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the need to\r\nrespect commitments based on treaties, conventions and\r\nother sources of law.\r\nMy country, like other States, has adopted several\r\nmeasures to reinforce international law and to encourage\r\nthe study and dissemination thereof. Libya is a member\r\nof most international conventions dealing with\r\ndisarmament, international terrorism and human rights.\r\nInternational law and humanitarian law are mandatory\r\nsubjects at Libyan universities and military academies.\r\nWe have organized several seminars to disseminate\r\ninformation on international law. Our delegation would\r\nlike to take this opportunity at the end of the Decade of\r\nInternational Law to reaffirm that Libya will always\r\nmaintain its respect for the rules of international law and\r\nits adherence to its provisions because we firmly believe\r\nthat this can help create a world where justice rules and\r\npeace and security prevail.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nMr. Gao Feng (China) (spoke in Chinese): The\r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law has registered\r\nmany tangible achievements, as is faithfully reflected in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. I would like to express my\r\nappreciation for this. The Chinese delegation has already\r\nmade its comments on these achievements in its statement\r\nto the Sixth Committee. Moreover, we believe it is\r\nnecessary, against the backdrop of some of this year’s\r\nmajor events in international relations, to reflect further on\r\nmajor issues that have an important bearing on the direction\r\nof the development of international law.\r\nThe development of international law is at a\r\ncrossroads. Since the end of the cold war, regional or\r\nsubregional conflicts resulting from intra-State ethnic\r\nproblems have become new threats to the international\r\npeace and security, subjecting the international order,\r\nembodied in the United Nations and its Charter, to\r\nunprecedented challenges. Humanitarian intervention under\r\nthe pretext of protecting human rights is being used by\r\nsome influential politicians as an answer to such challenges.\r\nWe all know that examples of humanitarian\r\nintervention are not hard to find — at least that has been\r\nthe case over the past 150 years — but its legality under\r\ninternational law has always been doubtful and\r\ncontroversial. This is because in the past 150 years there\r\nhas never been a case in which the intervening State has\r\nnot abused humanitarian principles for the sake of its own\r\ninterests. The unlawfulness of this is clearly stated in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Post-cold-war examples in Africa\r\nand the Balkans have shown that humanitarian intervention\r\nis still being used as an excuse for certain countries to\r\nrealize their own strategic interests. Such intervention is\r\nselective. It is an unlawful act carried out by one or two\r\ncountries or a group of countries on the basis of double\r\nstandards. Its nature did not, does not and will not change.\r\nIt is ironic that even those who have carried out such\r\ninterventions might also be reluctant to discuss or develop\r\ncriteria for humanitarian intervention to acquire legality\r\nunder international law because doing so would limit their\r\nfreedom in making such interventions. Such humanitarian\r\nintervention will not bring peace to the world, nor will it\r\neliminate humanitarian disasters. Intervention can be useful\r\nfor resolving crises only when it is decided by the\r\ncollective security regime, guided by the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nIt is true that the current collective security regime is\r\nnot perfect, but the consequences of abandoning such a\r\nregime would be very disastrous to world peace and\r\nsecurity and would far outweigh the defects of the regime.\r\nBesides, we still have opportunities to correct or mitigate\r\nthose defects through the reform of the United Nations.\r\nCertain humanitarian disasters in the context of\r\nregional conflicts require prompt action by the United\r\nNations, but such action has to be taken within the legal\r\nframework of the United Nations Charter. Protecting and\r\nrespecting human rights or people’s right to\r\nself-determination do not render the State insignificant.\r\nTruly meaningful human rights protection can be realized\r\nonly under the effective law and order of a State or the\r\ninternational community. The unbridled freedom of an\r\nindividual or a group of individuals outside the law will\r\nlead to the oppression of one group of people by another.\r\nThe incessant splitting of States since the end of the cold\r\nwar has not made States disappear. On the contrary, it has\r\nincreasingly demonstrated the political and social\r\nsignificance of national culture and national spirit\r\nembodied in States, and the unity between human rights\r\nand State sovereignty is also more obvious.\r\nFacts have shown that unlawful armed encroachment\r\non a nation’s sovereignty is by definition a serious\r\nviolation of human rights, and of that nation’s right to\r\nself-determination. It is totally unconvincing and\r\nextremely dangerous to argue that in order to protect a\r\nnation’s human rights, armed encroachment, in violation\r\nof international law, must be carried out against that\r\nnation’s sovereignty, and that in order to protect the\r\nhuman rights of a group of people of a nation, the human\r\nrights of another group of people of the same nation must\r\nbe forcibly denied, including their right to survival. The\r\nact of protecting human rights does not have the special\r\nstatus of being above international law. A legitimate goal\r\nshould be achieved only through legitimate means. This\r\nis a basic principle that a society based on the rule of law\r\nfollows as a matter of course.\r\nThe world legal order, with the United Nations\r\nCharter at its core, did not come into being out of thin\r\nair. It is the crystallization of hundreds of years of human\r\nexperience and wisdom. When carrying out\r\ncommemorative activities for the United Nations Decade\r\nof International Law and the centennial of the Hague\r\nInternational Peace Conference, we have emphasized,\r\nwithout exception, the utmost importance of the world\r\nlegal order centred on the United Nations Charter. The\r\nchanges in international relations since the end of the cold\r\nwar have posed certain new questions for us, but these\r\nnew questions are far from being significant enough to\r\nrequire the destruction of the principal pillars of this legal\r\norder. In the general trend of globalization, the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\ninternational community will be increasingly\r\ninstitutionalized and based on law. If we deviate from the\r\nprinciples of law, whether in pursuit of global or regional\r\npeace and security or for the protection of human rights, we\r\nwill find ourselves farther and farther from our goals and\r\nfrom international justice. Returning to a state of anarchy\r\nor to the law of the jungle offers absolutely no future.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision taken\r\nthis morning, I now call on the Observer of Switzerland.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French): Today\r\nwe are commemorating the end of the United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law. The year 1999 has also been\r\nmarked by other celebrations. I might mention first the\r\ncentennial of the first International Peace Conference, the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and the\r\ntenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild.\r\nIn launching the Decade, the General Assembly rightly\r\nrecognized the important place of the law of nations in\r\ninternational relations. Law constitutes the framework of\r\nthese relations, and it promotes harmonious, peaceful and\r\norderly development. The Assembly believed, more\r\nspecifically, that the United Nations should promote better\r\nacceptance of and respect for the principles of international\r\nlaw and that it should encourage the progressive\r\ndevelopment and codification of that law. The Decade,\r\ninter alia, was to promote the acceptance of and respect for\r\nthe principles of the law of nations, promote peaceful\r\nmeans of settling disputes and encourage the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law, as well as the education,\r\nstudy and dissemination of that law.\r\nDuring the past 10 years, many initiatives have been\r\ntaken to promote knowledge of and respect for international\r\nlaw. Study programmes have been developed. International\r\nbodies, scholarly societies and all types of associations have\r\nmade efforts with the same purpose in mind, and new\r\ncooperation has been established. The Swiss delegation is\r\npleased at this and hopes that the attention focused on\r\ninternational law will continue to be developed in the\r\nfuture.\r\nSince 1990 international law has undergone\r\nremarkable developments. Its evolution was undoubtedly\r\nmarked by the end of the East-West confrontation. Several\r\nimportant instruments were adopted both within and outside\r\nthe framework of the United Nations system. Let us recall\r\nfirst the Statute of the International Criminal Court, as well\r\nas the Statutes of the two International Criminal Tribunals,\r\nfor the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda; but we might\r\nalso think of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction or the\r\nInternational Labour Organization Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Worst Forms of Child Labour; or\r\nrevised Protocol II and Protocol IV of 1995 added to the\r\n1980 Convention on Certain Convention Weapons. The\r\nevolution was particularly striking in international\r\nhumanitarian law, one of the three areas dealt with by the\r\nfirst International Peace Conference in The Hague.\r\nFurthermore, new machinery was established to promote\r\nthe application of the law. One thinks, for example, of the\r\nperiodic meetings on international humanitarian law that\r\nSwitzerland has been called upon to convene as the\r\ndepositary of the Geneva Conventions. The\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice provided the opportunity to\r\nreflect deeply on the judicial settlement of international\r\ndisputes and to expand awareness of the Court’s\r\nactivities.\r\nUnfortunately, the assessment made at the end of the\r\nDecade does not include only positive elements. We are\r\nreminded every day that many efforts will continue to be\r\nnecessary if we want international law to be fully\r\nrespected. In particular, this pertains to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes and humanitarian law, whose rules\r\nare too often disregarded, even overtly flouted.\r\nUnfortunately, some parties continue to prefer to resort to\r\nweapons rather than to settle their disputes peacefully.\r\nNew forms of conflict have appeared. Some acts that\r\nhave been committed in disregard of the law constitute an\r\naffront to the human conscience. The Security Council\r\ndebates devoted to humanitarian law in recent months\r\nhave unfortunately confirmed the magnitude of the\r\nproblems to be resolved. However, we are pleased that\r\nthey also drew attention to the urgency of taking\r\ndecisions. The development of international law has also\r\nencountered certain impediments. As we know, major\r\ndifficulties arose in negotiations on certain instruments;\r\nthat was the case, in particular, in the area of human\r\nrights. The Swiss delegation hopes, in particular, that the\r\ntwo protocols to supplement the Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child will be adopted next year on the occasion of\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the\r\nConvention.\r\nTo improve the application of law, first of all one\r\nmust make its content known, and for that purpose one\r\nmust provide a proper education about its rules.\r\nInnovative methods of dissemination must be developed\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nand applied so as to enhance the effect of education and to\r\nreach all people who might apply the law. Along the same\r\nlines, we must give more thought to the means of\r\nmonitoring the application of law, whether by States or by\r\nindividuals. The most recent developments — in particular,\r\nthe adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal\r\nCourt — open up new prospects. A more systematic\r\nincrimination of those responsible for violations can\r\nstrengthen the authority of and respect for the law. But, no\r\ndoubt, one should not place an exclusive emphasis on\r\nenforcement. States should not rule out other means that\r\nmight, in some appropriate way, but perhaps less\r\nspectacularly, help ensure better respect for the law of\r\nnations.\r\nIn this regard, in terms of humanitarian law the Swiss\r\ndelegation would like to recall the importance of common\r\narticle I of the Geneva Conventions. This provision sets\r\nforth the obligation for States parties to respect and ensure\r\nrespect for the Conventions in all circumstances. The Swiss\r\nauthorities are determined to continue considering means of\r\npromoting respect for international humanitarian law and to\r\ntake the appropriate initiatives to that end. We should take\r\nstock of existing means, seek the reasons why they have\r\nnot performed in a fully satisfactory manner and identify\r\nnew methods.\r\nGenerally, States should give full effect to the rules\r\nthat bind them and, on the basis of the obligations imposed\r\nby international law, undertake commitments likely to\r\npromote the development of law and respect for its rules.\r\nThe Swiss delegation hopes that in commemorating\r\nthe end of the United Nations Decade of International Law,\r\nStates will recognize the importance of respect for that law\r\nand that they will commit themselves to continuing their\r\nefforts to promote the application and awareness of\r\ninternational law. Switzerland hopes that the dynamic\r\ncreated by the proclamation of the Decade will go on. We\r\nhope that the General Assembly will proclaim other decades\r\nin this area — not just for their own sake — but as a\r\nmeans of promoting respect for the rule of law in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 45/6 of 16 October 1990, I now call on the\r\nObserver of the International Committee of the Red Cross.\r\nMrs. Junod (International Committee of the Red\r\nCross) (spoke in French): I would like to begin by\r\nexpressing the gratitude of the International Committee of\r\nthe Red Cross (ICRC) for having been so closely associated\r\nwith the United Nations Decade of International Law, and\r\nits satisfaction at having been given the opportunity to\r\ncontribute to the Secretary-General’s report on this\r\nsubject.\r\nHowever, as the Decade draws to a close, we must\r\nconfess to having somewhat mixed feelings. In fact, even\r\nthough there have been considerable developments in the\r\nfield of international law, the reality is that there is still\r\na long way to go before an international order founded on\r\nlaw and justice can prevail. The number and magnitude\r\nof the armed conflicts we have had to deplore during the\r\nDecade obviously represent a setback for international\r\nlaw — as do the grave and large-scale violations of\r\nhumanitarian law committed during those conflicts.\r\nThe many hotbeds of war in Africa, Asia and Latin\r\nAmerica, the tragedies which have unfolded in the\r\nBalkans and the Caucasus region, the disintegration of\r\nState authority in certain contexts, the international\r\ncommunity’s belated reaction to the genocide in Rwanda,\r\nthe lack of coherence and consistency in the use of armed\r\nforce when human rights are violated or when\r\ninternational security is threatened, the controversies\r\nsurrounding the legality of the use of such force, in\r\nparticular during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\noperation in the Balkans — all these serve to demonstrate\r\nthat giving thought to a stronger international order based\r\non clear and respected international law is even more\r\nurgent today than it was ten years ago.\r\nWe must not, however, wallow in an assessment of\r\ncatastrophe, especially since there have also been\r\nindisputably positive developments deserving of\r\ncommendation. For example, the marked increase in the\r\nnumber of cases brought before the International Court of\r\nJustice is an encouraging sign when assessing the\r\nprogress of international law as a whole. However, we\r\nwill limit ourselves to a few comments with regard to\r\nhumanitarian law which relate specifically to the role and\r\nmandate of the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\n(ICRC).\r\nAn assessment of the subject-matter reveals\r\nundeniable progress in codification to which a number of\r\nrecent developments bear witness. Among those, we\r\nwould mention the adoption of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention; the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons; the\r\namended Protocol on Mines, Booby Traps and Other\r\nDevices; the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel mines\r\nand an additional Protocol for the Protection of Cultural\r\nProperty in the Event of Armed Conflict. Besides these,\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nof course, there are also the international treaties related to\r\nhumanitarian law, such as the instruments for the repression\r\nof international terrorism and the Convention on the Safety\r\nof United Nations and Associated Personnel.\r\nIn the area of repression of violations, the\r\nestablishment of the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunals\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda paved the way\r\nfor the adoption last year in Rome of the Statute for the\r\nfuture International Criminal Court, which is a significant\r\nadvance.\r\nMoreover, humanitarian law has been reaffirmed and\r\nclarified in a number of areas such as naval warfare,\r\nprotection of the environment, displaced persons and,\r\nrecently, thanks to an initiative of the Secretary-General,\r\nthe observance by United Nations forces of international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nThe ICRC is pleased and very proud to have been\r\ninvolved, in its capacity as expert on and guardian of\r\nhumanitarian law, in almost all these developments. In this\r\nrespect, it is worth mentioning here its close cooperation\r\nwith the San Remo International Institute of Humanitarian\r\nLaw with regard to naval warfare, its organization of expert\r\nstudies and the publication of reports relating to the\r\nprotection of the environment, displaced persons, the\r\nprotocols on conventional weapons and the drafting of the\r\nICC Statute and its participation in the elaboration of the\r\nConvention on the Safety and Security of United Nations\r\nand Associated Personnel.\r\nFurthermore, during these years, the ICRC has striven\r\nto develop a constructive relationship with States and with\r\nall those who must apply humanitarian law. For this\r\npurpose, the ICRC set up an Advisory Service to provide\r\ntechnical assistance in the drafting of domestic legislation\r\nfor the implementation of humanitarian law. It has also\r\npursued its dissemination efforts regarding humanitarian\r\nlaw, notably among the armed forces and bearers of\r\nweapons.\r\nAnother ICRC initiative has been the launching of a\r\nwide-ranging study on customary norms of humanitarian\r\nlaw, involving specialists and research teams from all parts\r\nof the world, the results of which will be published next\r\nyear. This study responds to concerns for gaining a better\r\nunderstanding, beyond the mere texts of how humanitarian\r\nlaw is actually applied, and thereby going beyond the\r\npurely formal framework. It should give new impetus to the\r\ncrucial debate on humanitarian law and its implementation.\r\nAlong similar lines, with the assistance of National\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the ICRC\r\nconducted an in-depth survey, particularly in several\r\ncountries having experienced war, in order to gain a\r\nclearer insight into the perceptions of the local\r\npopulations and the role of humanitarian law in the\r\nconflicts they had lived through. The opinions of these\r\n“People on War”, as we have dubbed them, will serve as\r\nan invaluable contribution to the debate on humanitarian\r\nlaw and action, and perhaps — let us hope — to the\r\ndevelopment of international law and order better able to\r\nprevent and contain armed conflicts.\r\nRespect for human dignity in all circumstances,\r\ncompassion for those who suffer, and solidarity are the\r\nprinciples which are the very foundation of the Geneva\r\nConventions. The 14 world-renowned signatories of the\r\nSolemn Appeal launched in commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Geneva Conventions, among them the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General, expressed their\r\nconviction that “disregard for these principles sets the\r\nstage for war and that respecting them during wartime\r\nfacilitates the restoration of peace”. This conviction is\r\nalso ours, and I have no doubt that it is the conviction of\r\nthe Assembly as well.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/3 of 13 October 1993, I now call\r\non the observer for the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\r\nMr. van den Hout (Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration): It is only appropriate that at the conclusion\r\nof the United Nations Decade of International Law we\r\nreflect on the centennial of the first International Peace\r\nConference, held in The Hague. Last year the United\r\nNations Secretary-General remarked that:\r\n“At that landmark gathering, the seeds were planted\r\nthat later germinated into the League of Nations and,\r\nultimately, the United Nations and its judicial organ,\r\nthe International Court of Justice.”\r\nThat gathering, in 1899, also established the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration, to which the participating States at\r\nthe time entrusted the peaceful settlement of international\r\ndisputes.\r\nThe Secretary-General acknowledges that:\r\n“today, the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the\r\nInternational Court of Justice are not merely\r\nneighbours in The Hague Peace Palace; they are\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\ncomplementary institutions offering the international\r\ncommunity a comprehensive range of options for\r\npeaceful resolution of disputes.”\r\nHe notes that:\r\n“settling international disputes by peaceful means, in\r\nconformity with the principles of justice and\r\ninternational law, is one of the central purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations set out in Article 1 of the United\r\nNations Charter. Arbitration is among the methods of\r\npeaceful settlement cited in Article 33 of the Charter,\r\nand the Permanent Court has a long and distinguished\r\nhistory in this regard.”\r\nWith the Permanent Court of Arbitration the\r\ninternational community has at its disposal a facility to\r\nadminister the settlement of disputes in an efficient and\r\ncost-effective way.\r\nAs one of the judges of the International Court of\r\nJustice remarked earlier this year:\r\n“A number of the Permanent Court’s awards have\r\nbecome classic, and dicta of international law\r\npronounced in a number of its awards have been\r\nwidely cited and relied on by jurists and arbitrators, as\r\nwell as by the International Court of Justice”.\r\nSince 1996, the International Bureau of the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration has administered six arbitral tribunals,\r\nproviding legal, administrative and logistical support to\r\nthose arbitrations. One of those concerns the arbitration\r\nbetween Eritrea and Yemen. In its first stage it dealt with\r\nthe sovereignty over a number of islands in the Red Sea.\r\nNow, in its second stage it will, in a number of weeks,\r\ndecide on the maritime delimitation between the two\r\ncountries. The International Bureau of the Court has also\r\nrecently taken on the registry role for the Confidentiality\r\nCommittee of the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons in The Hague. Other international and\r\nregional organizations have approached the Court in\r\nconnection with their desire to entrust to it a specific role\r\nin their procedures for dispute resolution.\r\nAlthough the Permanent Court of Arbitration is\r\ncurrently not involved in administering international\r\ncommercial arbitration, it is closely in touch with\r\ndevelopments in that field. First, this can be attributed to\r\nthe responsibility entrusted to the Secretary-General of the\r\nCourt by the United Nations Commission on International\r\nTrade Law (UNCITRAL) to break deadlocks that might\r\noccur in the establishment of arbitral tribunals under its\r\nArbitration Rules. The Secretary-General designates an\r\nappointing authority or himself assumes the role of\r\nappointing the second and/or third arbitrator. Since 1996,\r\nthe Permanent Court of Arbitration has handled more than\r\n50 complicated requests regarding the appointment of\r\narbitrators where parties in dispute were unable to\r\nconstitute the tribunals themselves.\r\nSecondly, several years ago the International Council\r\nfor Commercial Arbitration (ICCA) sought cooperation\r\nwith the Permanent Court of Arbitration to help realize its\r\nimportant publications. This arrangement has proven to be\r\nmutually beneficial. As far as this organization is\r\nconcerned, it gives the Court access to systematically\r\ncatalogued developments in the field of international\r\ncommercial arbitration. It is against this background that\r\nthe International Bureau will be implementing one of the\r\nproposals expressed during the commemorative session of\r\nthe Court’s Members Conference held on 17 May. I am\r\nreferring to the call to act “as a repository of information\r\nconcerning alternative methods of dispute resolution”. Use\r\nof modern information technology will be the key to\r\nsuccess here.\r\nAnother proposal submitted to the Court’s Members\r\nConference on 17 May that will be included in the\r\nInternational Bureau’s programme of work is the carrying\r\nout of a comparative analysis of the institutional and\r\nprocedural aspects of the various mass claims settlements\r\nsystems currently operational. I am referring to the\r\nIran-United States Claims Tribunal, the United Nations\r\nCompensation Commission, the Claims Resolution\r\nTribunal for Dormant Accounts and the Real Property\r\nClaims Commission, Bosnia, to mention four. Such an\r\nundertaking would catalogue information of great use to\r\nGovernments and other parties entrusted with the\r\nresponsibility of setting up new claims tribunals and help\r\nthem build on the experience of earlier tribunals.\r\nThe Bureau has also taken up the challenge\r\naddressed at the Conference to help fill the current gap in\r\nthe range of dispute resolution mechanisms for\r\ninternational environmental disputes. To allow parties to\r\navail themselves of these advantages, new rules of\r\nprocedure will be drawn up for this specific field. In\r\naddition, other measures will be taken to properly equip\r\nthe Court and its Bureau to handle such disputes. It\r\nshould be noted that compared to judicial settlement,\r\narbitration offers parties a greater comfort level because\r\nthey themselves decide on the procedures according to\r\nwhich the settlement procedure should take place.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nFurthermore, it allows for participation in the tribunals not\r\nonly of expert witnesses but also of arbitrators who\r\nthemselves are experts in this increasingly technical and\r\ncomplex field. This project has a relationship with the\r\nprevious one mentioned, namely, in those cases where\r\nenvironmental disputes or disasters lead to mass claims.\r\nThe United Nations Secretary-General has encouraged\r\nStates, international organizations and private parties to\r\nmake greater use of the services of the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration, which also include fact-finding and conciliation.\r\nIn his words, such recourse would “help ease the workload\r\nof the International Court of Justice and fill gaps\r\nconcerning arbitrations involving private parties and\r\ninternational organizations”.\r\nHe has also urged States that have not ratified the\r\nHague Conventions to do so. I would like to quote him\r\nonce again:\r\n“Developing countries in particular could well find the\r\nflexible instruments of dispute resolution to be an\r\ninvaluable asset.”\r\nArbitration thrives as an alternative to the formal\r\njudicial resolution of disputes by reasons of economy,\r\nefficiency and focus possible in an ad hoc adjudication.\r\nHence I would, in concluding, like to draw the attention of\r\ndelegates to the operative paragraphs of the resolution\r\nadopted by the members of the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration at its commemorative session on 17 May, which\r\nis printed on page 4 of document A/54/381, as well as to\r\noperative paragraph 11 of draft resolution II, on page 8 of\r\nthe report of the Sixth Committee in document A/54/609,\r\ncurrently before the Assembly. It seems most appropriate\r\nthat at the close of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law, Member States that have not yet done so\r\nheed the appeals to make greater use of the existing\r\nmechanisms of dispute resolution, and in particular of the\r\nservices offered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in the\r\ndebate on the occasion of the marking of the end of the\r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law.\r\nThe Assembly will now consider the report of the\r\nSixth Committee on agenda item 154, entitled “United\r\nNations Decade of International Law” (A/54/609).\r\nI request the Rapporteur of the Sixth Committee, Mr.\r\nJoško Klisović of Croatia, to introduce the report.\r\nMr. Klisović (Croatia): I have the honour to present\r\nto the General Assembly the report of the Sixth\r\nCommittee on agenda item 154, entitled “United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law”. The report of the Sixth\r\nCommittee on this item is contained in document\r\nA/54/609.\r\nThe Sixth Committee recommends to the General\r\nAssembly for adoption two draft resolutions, which are\r\ncontained in paragraph 15 of the report. Under the terms\r\nof the draft resolution entitled “Outcome of the action\r\ndedicated to the 1999 centennial of the first International\r\nPeace Conference”, the General Assembly would, inter\r\nalia, take note of the outcome of the centennial; commend\r\nall who contributed to the success of the celebration of\r\nthe centennial of the First International Peace Conference;\r\nand invite States, organs of the United Nations,\r\ninternational organizations and other relevant international\r\nforums to take note of the outcome of the centennial and\r\nto consider, where appropriate, giving attention to the\r\noutcome of the thematic discussions and making use of\r\nthe format of the centennial discussions.\r\nThe Assembly would also invite the Governments of\r\nthe Russian Federation and the Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands to file the records of the centennial in their\r\narchives and to provide access to these records to\r\ninterested parties. It would invite all who contributed to\r\nthe centennial to file their records in this respect with\r\neither of these Governments.\r\nWith regard to the draft resolution entitled “United\r\nNations Decade of International Law”, I should like to\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to a small typographical\r\nerror on page 8 of the report. At the end of operative\r\nparagraph 14, the footnote should read “5” instead of “1”.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution entitled\r\n“United Nations Decade of International Law”, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would, inter alia, acknowledge that the\r\nDecade has contributed significantly to the strengthening\r\nof the rule of international law and reaffirm the continued\r\nvalidity of the main objectives of the Decade.\r\nThe Secretary-General would be requested to\r\ncontinue developing the Treaty Section electronic\r\ndatabase and to keep the list of the titles of the\r\nmultilateral treaties deposited with him updated in all\r\nofficial languages of the Organization. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral would be further requested to implement\r\nvigorously the plan to eliminate the backlog in the\r\npublication of the United Nations Treaty Series and to\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 17 November 1999\r\nbring the resolution to the attention of States, international\r\norganizations and institutions working in the field of\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe General Assembly would also invite States,\r\norgans of the United Nations, international organizations\r\nand other relevant international forums to continue to give\r\nattention to the themes and outcome of the centennial of the\r\nfirst International Peace Conference.\r\nIt would also invite States and international\r\norganizations to continue promoting the acceptance of and\r\nrespect for the rules and principles of international law and\r\nthe strengthening of the use of means and methods of\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, as well as encouraging the\r\npublication of materials on subjects of international law and\r\nthe holding of meetings aimed at promoting a wider\r\nappreciation of international law.\r\nThe General Assembly would further invite States to\r\nconsider making full use of the facilities of the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration. It would invite States to become\r\nparties to the multilateral treaties adopted during the\r\nDecade.\r\nStates would also be invited to continue to pay\r\nattention to the identification of areas of international law\r\nthat might be ripe for progressive development or\r\ncodification.
