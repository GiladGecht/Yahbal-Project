(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Rodríguez\r\nParrilla (Cuba), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 47\r\nThe situation in Central America: procedures for the\r\nestablishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress\r\nin fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/54/311,\r\nA/54/355)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/54/L.24/Rev.1, A/54/L.27)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give the\r\nfloor to the representative of Colombia to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.24/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nColombia has the honour of introducing to the General\r\nAssembly draft resolution A/54/L.24/Rev.1, entitled “The\r\nsituation in Central America: procedures for the\r\nestablishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in\r\nfashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment”.\r\nI would like to convey our thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and to the various agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem for the timely provision of a range of detailed\r\nreports on the situation in Central America, which identify\r\nboth achievements and work remaining to be done,\r\nparticularly since the disasters caused by hurricane Mitch.\r\nOur gratitude also goes to the United Nations Verification\r\nMission in Guatemala (MINUGUA).\r\nThe peace being enjoyed today by our Central\r\nAmerican brothers is the fruit of an arduous process that\r\nhad the merit of expressing the feelings and the resolute\r\nwill of the people and the Governments of our region. For\r\nCentral Americans, as for all societies and nations, peace\r\nis an essential element for breaking down the barriers that\r\nlimit economic and social development. Now we have the\r\nnecessary legitimacy to proceed to build new\r\ndemocracies.\r\nColombia has resolutely supported the quest for\r\npeace in Central America ever since the first efforts\r\ncarried out by the Contadora Group in 1983, the\r\nEsquipulas process in 1986 and the 1987 Esquipulas II\r\npeace agreement. That is why we are honoured to affirm\r\nthat, 12 years after the signing of the agreement, the\r\nregion has responded positively. The time has come to\r\npay tribute to the Governments and peoples of Central\r\nAmerica for their determination, courage and tireless\r\nresolve to promote the cause of lasting peace, human\r\nrights, sustainable development and the rule of law.\r\nThis has been a difficult but productive year. A\r\nnumber of democratic electoral processes have taken\r\nplace in an atmosphere of calm and with full guarantees.\r\nThis is a positive sign of the strengthening of democracies\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nin the region. It is true that Hurricane Mitch — the worst\r\nnatural disaster that has ever befallen the region — had\r\nconsequences that imperilled the progress of this process.\r\nHowever, that very same natural phenomenon did have a\r\npositive impact on the international community, which\r\nreacted in solidarity and provided significant support for the\r\nrebuilding and rehabilitation of the countries hardest hit and\r\nof the region in general.\r\nThe reports of the Secretary-General confirm that the\r\nstrengthening of regional institutions continues. This is\r\nevidenced by the activities of the Central American\r\nIntegration System and the Central American Economic\r\nIntegration Bank. In the same vein, the Alliance for\r\nSustainable Development, which sets regional strategy\r\npriorities to promote respect for life, peace, democracy,\r\nhuman rights, ethnic diversity, economic integration and\r\nsustainable development, has continued to carry out its\r\nwork efficiently. Furthermore, the Central American Court\r\nof Justice has been incorporated into the system of regional\r\ninstitutions. These are undoubtedly the pillars of the\r\nprocess.\r\nWe wish to stress the important roles played by the\r\nSecretary-General, his special representatives, the organs\r\nand programmes of the United Nations, the support groups,\r\ndonors, financial institutions and the international\r\ncommunity. We appeal anew to all these actors to avoid the\r\nrisk of jeopardizing the results of the struggles, lessons\r\nlearned and successes of this process. Thus, the following\r\naffirmation of the Secretary-General in his report is very\r\nrelevant:\r\n“One should not underestimate the difficulties faced\r\nby the Central American Governments, particularly in\r\nreconciling the imperatives of economic growth,\r\nstability and equity. Successfully balancing these\r\nneeds is at the root of lasting peace.” (A/54/311, para.\r\n57)\r\nThe draft resolution before us is a summary of\r\nachievements to date and an account of what remains to be\r\ndone. We invite all member States to adopt it by consensus\r\nas a united response to the peoples and Governments of\r\nCentral America.\r\nMr. Orellana Mercado (Honduras) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me, Sir, through you and on behalf of the\r\nCentral American countries Costa Rica, the Dominican\r\nRepublic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama and\r\nHonduras to thank the States sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution entitled “The situation in Central America:\r\nprocedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting\r\npeace and progress in fashioning a region of peace,\r\nfreedom, democracy and development”. Their sponsorship\r\nattests to the solidarity that they have always extended to\r\nour countries. Similarly, we thank the General Assembly\r\nfor its support, trusting that, as in previous years, the draft\r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus.\r\nWe also convey our thanks to the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Colombia for his very lucid introduction\r\nof the draft resolution to the General Assembly.\r\nThis year marks the twelfth anniversary of the\r\nsigning of Esquipulas II and the tenth year since the\r\nCentral American Governments asked the United Nations\r\nto participate in implementing that agreement. Since then,\r\nthe peoples and Governments of Central America have\r\nbeen assisted in the process of establishing firm and\r\nlasting peace by this great Organization, the group of\r\nfriends of Central America, various countries bilaterally\r\nand the Rio Group, of which we are now full members.\r\nThanks to the support of the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community in general, Central America has\r\nmade significant progress since the General Assembly\r\nfirst considered this item in 1983. All our countries have\r\nmore pluralistic political regimes and have made\r\nsignificant progress in building democracy, good\r\ngovernance, respect for human rights, the rule of law and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nIn order to achieve the objectives of strengthening\r\npeace and securing development for the region, we have\r\nsigned a number of agreements, including Esquipulas II\r\nin 1987, the Tegucigalpa Protocol in 1991, the Guácimo\r\nDeclaration and the Alliance for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Central America in 1994 and, most\r\nrecently, the second Guatemala Declaration on 19 October\r\nthis year.\r\nLikewise, United Nations support through\r\npeacekeeping operations has been critical in fashioning a\r\nregion of peace, freedom, democracy and development.\r\nThe United Nations presence, through such operations as\r\nthe United Nations Observer Group in Central America,\r\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador and\r\nthe United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala,\r\nwas essential at the most critical times to the region\u0027s\r\naspirations to end armed conflict. The conversion of these\r\npeacekeeping operations into verification missions and, in\r\nsome cases, follow-up units attests to the positive results\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nof the regional and international endeavour to strengthen\r\npeace in Central America.\r\nIn the area of public security, a constant and priority\r\nconcern of our Governments, we have expanded civilian\r\npower and made efforts to strengthen and accelerate the\r\nadministration of justice by judicial institutions. These\r\nefforts in the area of public security and human rights have\r\nbeen undertaken on a regional basis through presidential\r\nand ministerial summits.\r\nIn the economic sphere, too, we have made significant\r\nprogress. We participate in regional economic cooperation\r\nagreements and regional summits that give priority to\r\nmatters relating to the socio-economic situation of Central\r\nAmerica, the region\u0027s vulnerability to natural disasters,\r\nsustainable development and trade integration. These\r\nagreements and summits underscore the importance of these\r\nissues to the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law,\r\nthe participation of civil society and human rights.\r\nThe systematic advances of Central America were\r\nthreatened by the destruction wrought by hurricane Mitch\r\nin October 1998. In the year that has passed since Mitch\r\nstruck the region, the peoples, civil society and\r\nGovernments of Central America have devoted great effort\r\nto rebuilding and transforming our countries. In this\r\nprocess, we have invariably relied on the support of the\r\ninternational community, which responded immediately and\r\ncontinuously to one of the worst hurricanes of this century.\r\nThis solidarity is expressed in the Stockholm\r\nDeclaration, which proposes, as the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/54/311) notes in paragraph 20, a plan of action\r\nfor the future based on “an integrated focus on transparency\r\nand governability; consolidation of democracy and good\r\ngovernance to reinforce the process of decentralization with\r\nthe active participation of civil society; [and] promotion of\r\nhuman rights as a permanent objective, with special\r\nattention to gender equality and the rights of children and\r\nethnic groups”.\r\nIn the words of the President of the Republic of\r\nHonduras, Mr. Carlos Roberto Flores Facussé, in his\r\naddress to the General Assembly this year,\r\n“Central America is preparing to cross the bridge\r\nbetween the millenia with all its republics more\r\nintegrated with each other than ever before, identifying\r\nwith each other in the common ideal of keeping\r\nourselves united so that we are stronger, of playing a\r\nstellar role in the American continent, of turning the\r\nisthmus into a point of strategic convergence for\r\nworld trade and of writing ourselves into a success\r\nstory that will serve as an example and touchstone\r\nto the world community.” (A/54/PV.8, p.3)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call on\r\nthe representative of Mexico to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/54/L.27.\r\nMr. Albin (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nMexican delegation is honoured to introduce on behalf of\r\nthe sponsoring countries the draft resolution entitled\r\n“United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala”,\r\ncontained in document A/54/L.27. In addition to the\r\ncountries named in the draft resolution, which are the\r\nmembers of the Group of Friends of the Guatemalan\r\npeace process, the following delegations are also sponsors\r\nof the draft resolution: Austria, Belgium, Canada,\r\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland,\r\nItaly, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United\r\nKingdom, Sweden and Uruguay.\r\nThe preambular part gives us a brief account of the\r\nvarious reports that have been submitted to the Assembly\r\nfor its consideration. It also stresses the role played by the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA) in support of the peace process and the\r\nconcern of the parties for the continued presence of the\r\nMission in Guatemala.\r\nThe operative part welcomes the ninth report of the\r\nMission and the report of the Commission for Historical\r\nClarification and its recommendations. It takes note with\r\nsatisfaction of the progress made in the implementation of\r\nthe peace agreements and of the initiatives of the\r\ncommissions created in the framework of those\r\nagreements.\r\nThe draft resolution underscores that certain key\r\nreforms remain outstanding in the fiscal, military and\r\nelectoral areas, which highlights the importance of\r\ncontinued compliance with the peace agreements in the\r\nyear 2000. The Government is encouraged to implement\r\nits decision to adopt a new military doctrine and to\r\nimplement the agreements concerning the Presidential\r\nMilitary Staff.\r\nThe text also underscores the fundamental need to\r\nachieve the targets for fiscal income that appear in the\r\nAgreement on Social and Economic Aspects and the\r\nAgrarian Situation, and it urges the Government to step\r\nup its work of promoting human rights, taking into\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\naccount the recommendations of MINUGUA, to provide all\r\npossible assistance in the investigation of the murder of\r\nMonsignor Juan Jose Gerardi Conedera and to follow up\r\nthe recommendations of the Commission for Historical\r\nClarification in order to promote national reconciliation.\r\nI wish to draw the attention of the Secretariat to the\r\nneed to ensure that the Spanish version be aligned with the\r\noriginal English version.\r\nThe draft resolution also welcomes the commitment to\r\nthe implementation of the peace agreements made by the\r\npresidential candidates and their support for the extension\r\nof the mandate of MINUGUA, and encourages the parties\r\nand all sectors of Guatemalan society to continue efforts to\r\nachieve the goals of the peace agreements.\r\nOne particularly important point is the invitation\r\nextended to the international community and to the United\r\nNations agencies, programmes and funds to continue to\r\ndevelop their technical and financial assistance programmes\r\nand projects within the framework of the implementation of\r\nthe peace agreements. In this context, the draft resolution\r\nstresses the continued importance of close cooperation\r\namong them.\r\nThe text stresses that MINUGUA is a key instrument\r\nin the consolidation of peace, promotion and observance of\r\nhuman rights and building confidence in the implementation\r\nof the peace agreements. For this reason, it is proposed that\r\nthe Assembly decide to authorize the renewal of the\r\nmandate of the Mission from 1 January until 31 December\r\n2000.\r\nFinally, the draft resolution requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit, as early as possible, an updated report\r\nto the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, with his\r\nassessment and recommendations with regard to the peace\r\nprocess after 31 December 2000, and requests him to keep\r\nthe General Assembly fully informed of the implementation\r\nof the resolution.\r\nGuatemala is approaching the new millennium with a\r\nnew face, a face whose features are the resolve and\r\nconviction of a people seeking peace, the certainty\r\nstemming from the establishment of new and better\r\npolitical, economic and social institutions and the well-\r\nfounded hope in a future of greater prosperity.\r\nOur satisfaction with progress achieved in the peace\r\nprocess is due essentially to the Guatemalan people. It is\r\ntrue that much remains to be done. But we are convinced\r\nthat the dedication of the Guatemalan Government and\r\nGuatemalan society to peace and development provides a\r\nguarantee that the goals of the peace agreements will be\r\nfully attained.\r\nThe General Assembly has before it a fresh\r\nopportunity to reaffirm its support for and solidarity with\r\nthe peace process in Guatemala. The United Nations is\r\nentitled to share the satisfaction and the hope embodied\r\nin another successful experience in the work of our\r\nOrganization to promote peace. The sponsoring countries\r\ntrust that draft resolution A/54/L.27 will command the\r\nAssembly\u0027s unanimous support.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ncolleague and friend, Angel Edmundo Orellana Mercado,\r\nAmbassador and Permanent Representative of Honduras\r\nto the United Nations, has addressed the general topic of\r\nour agenda on behalf of all the Central American\r\ncountries. I would like to refer on this occasion to the\r\ndraft resolution regarding the United Nations Verification\r\nMission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) contained in\r\ndocument A/54/L.27, introduced by my colleague from\r\nMexico.\r\nI would like to begin by expressing my appreciation\r\nfor the initiative taken by Colombia, Mexico, Norway,\r\nSpain, the United States and Venezuela in sponsoring this\r\ndraft resolution. A great deal has been done by these\r\ncountries, known collectively as the Friends of the\r\nGuatemalan peace process, to assist in both the\r\nnegotiation and the implementation of the peace\r\nagreements in Guatemala. We are particularly gratified at\r\nthe fundamental objective of this proposal: the continued\r\npresence of the United Nations Verification Mission in\r\nmy country.\r\nI believe that this reflects the sentiments of the\r\nmajority of Guatemalans and certainly those of my\r\nGovernment. It is significant that throughout the political\r\ncampaign leading to the first round of general elections,\r\nheld just 12 days ago, and whose final outcome will be\r\ndecided in the run-off scheduled for 26 December, each\r\nand every one of the political parties, without exception,\r\nexpressed full support for the implementation of the peace\r\nagreements, as well as for the continued presence in\r\nGuatemala of the Verification Mission. Indeed,\r\nMINUGUA forms an integral part of those Agreements.\r\nMINUGUA became operational at the end of 1994,\r\nin response to what had been agreed upon between the\r\nGovernment and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nGuatemalteca (URNG) in the Comprehensive Agreement on\r\nHuman Rights signed in March of that year. Its mandate\r\nwas, however, substantially broadened by the Agreement on\r\na Firm and Lasting Peace, signed in December 1996, by\r\nwhich MINUGUA was requested to verify the fulfilment of\r\nall the obligations the parties had assumed. The Mission\r\nwas asked by the signatory parties to become an agent for\r\nconfidence and dependability in the fulfilment of the\r\nagreements referred to in the agreed timetable, which\r\ncovered the period 1997-2000. MINUGUA\u0027s mandate\r\nincludes verification, the exercise of good offices or\r\nfacilitation, the provision of advisory services and technical\r\nsupport, and public information functions.\r\nAs is only natural with such a comprehensive,\r\ncomplex and delicate mandate, the work of MINUGUA has\r\nnot been without problems and controversies; but we\r\nbelieve that this work has been conducted in an exemplary\r\nmanner, to the credit of the United Nations and the benefit\r\nof Guatemala. As I said at the beginning, the presence of\r\nMINUGUA has been crucial to the satisfactory\r\ndevelopment of the peace process, which has achieved\r\nremarkable advances. The transparent and participatory\r\nmanner in which the general elections have been held is\r\nonly one of the signs of the strides made in the\r\nconsolidation of a pluralistic democracy.\r\nAt the same time, and as could be expected, much\r\nremains to be done, and this is reflected in the draft\r\nresolution before us. Some of the significant obligations\r\nthat were to be brought into effect in the last three years\r\nwere not fulfilled, or were only partly fulfilled. The\r\nfulfilment of yet other undertakings was foreseen only for\r\nthe year 2000. As long as the Agreement on the\r\nImplementation, Compliance and Verification Timetable for\r\nthe Peace Agreements is in force, doing without the\r\npresence and the good offices of the United Nations would\r\nbe unthinkable.\r\nFinally, from the perspective of the United Nations, its\r\ninvolvement in Central America in general and, more\r\nspecifically, in Guatemala, should be seen, on balance, as\r\na resounding success. The Organization has assisted\r\nGovernments and civil societies in finding avenues to\r\nreconciliation in areas marked by conflict, while also\r\nhelping them resume the path to development in areas\r\nmarked by stagnation or economic regression. At all times\r\nthe Organization has acted without any particular agenda,\r\nguided only by the fundamental ethical principles to which\r\nit is held by the Charter, as well as by the guidance\r\nreceived from the national actors involved in this success\r\nstory. It is therefore altogether fitting that the Organization\r\nshould continue to be present until the peace process is\r\nfully consolidated.\r\nFor all these reasons, I join the sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution in requesting all the members of the Assembly\r\nto support it.\r\nMs. Rasi (Finland): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries associated with the European\r\nUnion — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia — and the associated countries, Cyprus and\r\nMalta — align themselves with this statement.\r\nLet me at the outset express our gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for providing us with excellent, detailed\r\nreports on the situation in Central America and on the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA). In particular, we would like to express our\r\ngratitude for their timely distribution. We look forward to\r\nthe fourth report on the implementation of the Guatemala\r\npeace agreements.\r\nThe European Union recognizes with great\r\nsatisfaction that all countries of Central America are\r\nunder democratic rule today, and that democratization and\r\nsocial development in the region have progressed. Not\r\nonly is there peace in the whole isthmus, but democracy\r\nhas also taken root as a generally accepted political\r\nsystem. Indeed, significant progress has been achieved\r\nsince 1983, when this item was first discussed.\r\nThe European Union supports this positive\r\ndevelopment and encourages the countries in the region\r\nto continue on this path. Recent elections have taken\r\nplace in a transparent and orderly manner. However, to\r\nimprove electoral participation — a cornerstone of true\r\ndemocracy — determined legislative and administrative\r\nmeasures are in some cases needed to make it easier for\r\neveryone to cast a vote.\r\nLast year the Central American region was\r\ndevastated by hurricane Mitch. The European Union\r\nprovided humanitarian relief and helped in reconstruction.\r\nIn the months after the catastrophe, it became clear that\r\nthose efforts alone were not enough. Change is also\r\nneeded, and in this respect the European Union has\r\ncontinued its dialogue with the countries affected by this\r\ndisaster to make sure that the people of the region\r\ncontinue to reap the benefits of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nThe Stockholm conference held in May created a solid\r\nfoundation for our cooperation in this area. We committed\r\nourselves to sharing the responsibility for achieving the\r\nreconstruction and the transformation of the countries\r\nconcerned. This establishes a long-term partnership guided\r\nby the priorities defined by the Central American countries\r\nand based on the following goals and principles reiterated\r\nin the Stockholm Declaration of 28 May 1999: the\r\nreduction of social and ecological vulnerability in the\r\nregion; the reconstruction and transformation of Central\r\nAmerica on the basis of an integrated approach of\r\ntransparency and good governance; the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy and good governance; the promotion of respect\r\nfor human rights, gender equality and the rights of children,\r\nethnic groups and minorities; and the intensification of\r\nefforts to reduce the external debt burden. The European\r\nUnion welcomes the establishment in September at Madrid\r\nof a follow-up mechanism to the Stockholm Declaration.\r\nThe European Union has supported international and\r\nregional efforts in the search for a negotiated peace in\r\nCentral America from the very start, including the\r\nendeavours of the Contadora Group, which was set up in\r\n1983, the Esquipulas process, which began in 1986, and the\r\nEsquipulas II peace treaty of 1987. The San José dialogue,\r\nin which the Central American countries and the European\r\nUnion have been engaged since 1983, has undoubtedly\r\ncontributed to the emergence of the Central American\r\ninitiative for a negotiated settlement. It continues to\r\ncontribute decisively to the efforts of the Central American\r\ncountries in making the processes of peace and democracy\r\nin the area irreversible, to full respect for human rights and\r\nbasic freedoms, to promoting the development of the most\r\nvulnerable sections of the population and to consolidating\r\nregional integration.\r\nOur political support for the countries of Central\r\nAmerica has always been complemented by substantial\r\nassistance in the humanitarian field, as well as in\r\ndevelopment and economic cooperation. Throughout the\r\ntimes of war, the European Union was the principal aid\r\ndonor to Central American refugees, displaced and\r\nrepatriated persons and demobilized fighters.\r\nEver since the peace process started, the European\r\nUnion has worked to strengthen democratic institutions and\r\nto promote respect for human rights in the region. We can\r\nnow note that some progress has taken place with regard to\r\nhuman rights, although there are still many problems,\r\nparticularly in the functioning of the judicial system.\r\nPoverty and violence are the main social problems that\r\nneed to be addressed in order to achieve not only political\r\npeace but also social peace and internal security. The\r\nprimary responsibility for combating these problems lies\r\nwith the Central American countries themselves, but they\r\ncan count on the full support of the European Union in\r\ntheir endeavours, including the bilateral aid programmes\r\nof member States.\r\nNicaragua has a historical opportunity to reconstruct\r\nand to transform its country. The European Union, which\r\nhas responded generously to the appeals from the\r\nNicaraguan Government for support of the reconstruction\r\nefforts, would like to see a rapid solution to its\r\ninstitutional problems in order to prevent further negative\r\nrepercussions. In particular, the European Union wishes\r\nto express its deep concern regarding the events that led\r\nto the imprisonment of the Comptroller General of\r\nNicaragua. The European Union sincerely hopes that the\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua will respond positively to our\r\ndeep concern, and thus assure a stronger basis for a\r\ncontinued cooperation highlighting the shared values\r\nagreed upon in the meetings of the San José dialogue,\r\nsuch as those of democracy, the rule of law and good\r\ngovernance.\r\nI now turn to the current situation in Guatemala.\r\nAlmost three years have passed since the peace\r\nagreements were signed. The European Union has fully\r\ncommitted itself to supporting the implementation of\r\nthose agreements. The responsibility for the\r\nimplementation of the agreements lies with the\r\nGuatemalan Government, but we call on the whole\r\ninternational community to continue to support it in its\r\nefforts.\r\nThe European Union commends the Guatemalan\r\npeople, its constitutional and political representatives and\r\nall sectors of civil society for their efforts to implement\r\nthe peace agreements and for the progress achieved so\r\nfar, notably regarding the status of women and\r\nrepatriation. We welcome the completion last June of the\r\nrepatriation programme. However, much remains to be\r\ndone. Despite the result of the referendum last May, it is\r\nof the utmost importance that the peace agreements be\r\nfully implemented, especially with regard to full respect\r\nfor human rights, equal opportunities for the indigenous\r\npopulation, reform of the judicial system, fiscal and land\r\nreform, and reconciliation based on truth. We are\r\nconfident that in all these fields there will be a definitive\r\nmove towards reform after the conclusion of the electoral\r\nprocess.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nThe end of the armed conflict and the signing of the\r\npeace agreements were brought about by the efforts of\r\nvarious successive Governments in cooperation with social,\r\neconomic and political organizations. The European Union\r\nbelieves that their implementation requires the joint efforts\r\nof all sectors of Guatemalan society for a sustained period\r\nto turn the agreed measures and objectives into lasting\r\nreality. We thus urge all of them, and particularly the\r\npolitical parties involved in the ongoing electoral process,\r\nto continue to commit themselves to the full implementation\r\nof the peace agreements.\r\nThe European Union has noted with satisfaction the\r\nwork of the Commission for Historical Clarification. The\r\nUnion urges the Guatemalan authorities to take all steps\r\nnecessary to implement the Commission\u0027s recommendations\r\nto the fullest extent possible as a further new element in the\r\nexisting peace process, in order to strengthen\r\ndemocratization and to lay the foundations for true\r\nreconciliation in Guatemalan society.\r\nThe European Union deplores the fact that serious law\r\nand order problems continue to imperil citizens\u0027 security in\r\nGuatemala. We are concerned about unresolved cases of\r\nviolent crimes, in particular the still unresolved murder of\r\nBishop Gerardi, and human rights violations. The European\r\nUnion calls upon the competent authorities of Guatemala to\r\nrenew efforts to ensure a full investigation and to bring\r\nthose responsible to justice. We believe that strengthening\r\nthe judicial power will be crucial for ending impunity and\r\nguaranteeing the rule of law.\r\nAll this being said, the European Union strongly\r\nsupports the indispensable work and activities of the United\r\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA),\r\nwhose primary function is to ensure the full implementation\r\nof the Peace Agreements in a period of four years, which\r\nstarted in 1997. MINUGUA remains at the centre of\r\ninternational efforts to strengthen confidence in the\r\nconsolidation of peace in Guatemala. Last year, we\r\nwelcomed and supported the Mission\u0027s restructuring and\r\nstrengthening. We note with satisfaction that this has\r\nenhanced MINUGUA\u0027s ability to carry out its complex\r\nmandate, which also includes good offices, advisory and\r\nsupport services, and public information tasks.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to commend the members\r\nof the Mission for their valuable work. The Mission has\r\nentered into the third phase of its mandate, covering further\r\ndevelopment in the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nvarious commissions and promotion of broad administrative\r\nand legislative reform.\r\nAs to El Salvador, the European Union recognizes\r\nthat further advances have been made in the\r\nimplementation of outstanding elements of the 1992 peace\r\nagreements, in particular with regard to the land transfer\r\nprogramme.\r\nIn other fields, however, certain obstacles to the\r\nimplementation of pending issues remain. In this\r\nconnection, may I just mention the rural settlements\r\nprogramme and the problems faced by relatives of\r\ndeceased combatants who did not appear in the original\r\n1993 census.\r\nAlso, we hope for further progress regarding the\r\nrespect, protection and promotion of human rights. In this\r\nconnection, we would like to stress the importance of the\r\nimpartial and active role of the human rights ombudsman.\r\nThe European Union, in this regard, takes note of the\r\nninth meeting, in February, of the Central American\r\nCouncil of Ombudsmen and its collective call made to\r\ntheir respective Governments.\r\nFurthermore, the European Union wishes to\r\nunderline that in the field of public security, and in\r\nparticular with regard to the national civilian police,\r\nefforts to implement necessary reforms must continue. In\r\ngeneral, we consider it imperative to sustain the gains of\r\nthe peace process and consolidate the institutions it\r\ncreated.\r\nThe European Union therefore strongly supports\r\nefforts by the United Nations to foster the consolidation\r\nof the peace-building process in El Salvador. The United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) has been\r\nentrusted with the necessary follow-up to these matters,\r\nin consultation with donor Governments, while the\r\nOrganization\u0027s good-offices functions will continue to be\r\ncarried out by the United Nations Secretariat in\r\ncoordination with UNDP.\r\nAt the fifteenth San José Ministerial Conference\r\nbetween the countries of the European Union and the\r\nmember States of the Central American Integration\r\nSystem, which was held in Bonn in May, the European\r\nUnion reaffirmed its will to continue cooperating with the\r\nregion in order to help consolidate its full development.\r\nThe fifteenth Ministerial Conference welcomed the\r\nconsolidation of Central America as a region of peace and\r\ndemocracy and recognized the efforts made by the Central\r\nAmerican countries to guarantee the security of the\r\npopulation. In this connection, the European Union\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nreiterates its willingness to reinforce its cooperation with\r\nrespective Central American initiatives, in particular\r\nregarding the training of civilian police and the\r\ndevelopment of better relations between citizens and\r\ncivilian police through information and dialogue. The\r\nEuropean Union also supports closer economic integration\r\nin the region.\r\nIn recent years, the European Union and Central\r\nAmerica have tightened their links and developed a rich\r\nnetwork of relations. While reaffirming our support for the\r\nactivities of the United Nations in the region, we also look\r\nforward to an intensified cooperation and dialogue with\r\nCentral America in the framework of the United Nations,\r\nbased on shared values and common views on subjects of\r\nglobal importance.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): When we debated this item last\r\nyear, Central America had only days before lived through\r\none of the worst natural disasters of this century, Hurricane\r\nMitch. Although the devastation it caused still has not been\r\ncompletely overcome, the situation has improved markedly.\r\nThe hurricane triggered one of the largest international\r\ncoordinated emergency actions ever. Norway has\r\ncontributed heavily to this assistance.\r\nAn important aspect of the large aid package went\r\nbeyond merely restoring everything back to normal. The\r\ndonor countries have, in close cooperation with the stricken\r\ncountries, endeavoured to introduce mechanisms aimed at\r\nimproving life for all in Central America in the longer term.\r\nWithin the assistance programmes we have been, and are\r\nstill, encouraging good governance and higher transparency\r\nin government. We will continue to support further efforts\r\nin this regard.\r\nThe presidential elections in Guatemala have now\r\ngone through their first round. A number of international\r\nobservers were present, and we understand they were\r\nsatisfied with the way the elections were conducted. Best of\r\nall, the voter turnout was a lot higher than expected.\r\nNorway congratulates Guatemala on these achievements,\r\nand we all look forward to the second round at Christmas.\r\nTransforming the peace agreements into reality is\r\nchallenging. In the middle of the year the attempt to reform\r\nthe Constitution ran aground. We take it that the\r\nGuatemalans themselves will consider why this important\r\nstep forward was not achieved at that time, and we trust\r\nthat further progress will be made in the long run.\r\nThe sombre report of the truth Commission was\r\nreleased early in the year, as scheduled. The details of\r\nwhat went on during 36 years of civil war make for sad\r\nreading indeed. The fact that it was published is,\r\nhowever, a triumph for the implementation of the peace\r\nprocess.\r\nNorway has undertaken to support the\r\nimplementation of the peace agreements in Guatemala to\r\nthe amount of 100 million Norwegian kroner per year\r\nthroughout the implementation period, that is, 1996 to\r\n2000. This includes being one of the main contributors to\r\nthe United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA), whose presence and participation in the\r\nimplementation process we consider to be of the greatest\r\nimportance. Norway stresses the importance of extending\r\nMINUGUA\u0027s mandate to coincide with the\r\nimplementation of the peace agreements. We therefore\r\nsupport the extension of the mandate until 31 December\r\n2000.\r\nThe people and government of Guatemala are at a\r\ncrucial stage of the peace process. It is now that the\r\nfoundation is being laid for a nation with equal rights and\r\nopportunities for all, as specified in the peace agreements.\r\nWe urge the Guatemalans to stand united behind the\r\nchanges that must be made in order to achieve the\r\nambitious goals of the agreements and to make this a\r\nnational task, irrespective of political or socio-cultural\r\naffiliation.\r\nOn behalf of the Norwegian Government, I reiterate\r\nNorway\u0027s willingness to follow up and continue to support\r\nGuatemala in its efforts to implement the peace\r\nagreements.\r\nMr. Acharia (India): My delegation thanks the\r\nSecretary-General for his report contained in document\r\nA/54/311, outlining progress achieved by the countries of\r\nthe Central American region in the areas of peace,\r\nfreedom, democracy and development. India\u0027s engagement\r\nwith these countries is well known, and I am happy to\r\ntake the floor on this agenda item as a reflection of our\r\nabiding solidarity and our commitment to strengthening\r\nour relations with them.\r\nIndia\u0027s growing interaction with the countries of the\r\nregion is manifested in diverse areas. We have always\r\nbeen a supportive partner in Central America\u0027s quest for\r\ndemocratization and development. India participated in the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Missions in El Salvador and\r\nNicaragua. Within the framework of the Indian Technical\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nand Economic Cooperation Programme, India has attempted\r\nto share its technical expertise with the countries of the\r\nregion in areas of interest to them. It is a matter of some\r\nsatisfaction that these have included areas of high\r\ntechnology, including information technology. Last year and\r\nduring the early part of this year, to give but one example,\r\nIndia was privileged to receive 120 nationals of El Salvador\r\nfor a nine-month training course on software development.\r\nWe are continuing to expand technical and economic\r\ncooperation between India and the countries of the Central\r\nAmerican region and are imparting to it an additional\r\nregional focus by building on the concept of multiple\r\nbeneficiaries put forward by the Secretary-General in the\r\ncontext of South-South cooperation.\r\nAs a democracy, India shares the satisfaction of the\r\nCentral American countries at the consolidation of\r\ndemocratic processes in the region. We congratulate our\r\nfriends on having successfully organized free and\r\ntransparent elections during the past year in Belize, El\r\nSalvador and Panama, in spite of formidable challenges,\r\nincluding the devastation caused by hurricane Mitch. We\r\nare happy to conclude from the Secretary-General\u0027s report\r\nthat these advances of democracy have been strengthened\r\nin spite of internal social difficulties, “compounded by\r\nregional and international criminal networks”. (A/54/311,\r\npara. 12) The Secretary-General has also noted troubling\r\ncases of threats to members of the judiciary. In an era of\r\nglobalization, Central America is not alone in facing these\r\nchallenges to democratically elected Governments by\r\nterrorists and criminals, fomented by external forces. The\r\ninternational community will need to act in concert to\r\nensure effective action against terrorists and criminal\r\nelements which, using the international financial system and\r\nexploiting the problems of underdevelopment, seek to\r\ndestabilize democratically elected Governments. Democracy\r\nshould be allowed to flourish without any outside\r\ninterference.\r\nLast year my delegation noted that the strenuous effort\r\nof a number of years for economic development in the\r\nregion was grievously retarded by the devastation wrought\r\nby hurricane Mitch. We endorsed the call of a noted\r\nNicaraguan economist, Alejandro Martínez Cuenca, for a\r\nMarshall Plan-style initiative to rebuild the countries of\r\nCentral America affected by hurricane Mitch. We therefore\r\nnote with satisfaction the pledge by the international\r\ncommunity to provide $6 billion in disaster relief,\r\nreconstruction assistance and debt forgiveness, made at the\r\nfirst meeting of the Consultative Group on Reconstruction\r\nand Transformation on 10 and 11 December 1998 in\r\nWashington. It is to be commended that, six months later,\r\nat the follow-up meeting of the Consultative Group in\r\nStockholm from 25 to 28 May 1999, the international\r\ncommunity pledged an additional amount of $9 billion.\r\nIndia also extended symbolic assistance, within its\r\nconstraints, for immediate relief and rehabilitation to\r\nthose countries in the aftermath of hurricane Mitch.\r\nIt is clear that, after more than 35 years of\r\ninternecine conflict, the historic Guatemalan peace\r\nagreements are bringing to an end the vicious circle of\r\npolitical instability that had retarded economic and social\r\ndevelopment. All steps should be taken to continue the\r\nimplementation of the peace agreements. It is a pleasure\r\nto note that the economies of the Central American region\r\ngrew by 4.4 per cent in 1998, as compared with 4.3 per\r\ncent in 1997 and 2.1 per cent in 1996. The fact that this\r\ngrowth was possible, despite a decrease in the annual\r\ngross national of 2.4 per cent in Honduras and of 1.8 per\r\ncent in Nicaragua, owing to economic losses due to\r\nhurricane Mitch, is to be applauded. Economic and social\r\ndevelopment is essential if the faith of people in\r\ndemocracy is to be sustained. As the President of\r\nHonduras said, addressing the General Assembly at its\r\ncurrent session,\r\n“We struggle each and every day to make\r\ndemocratic rule able to govern, credible, hope-\r\ninspiring and trustworthy in the eyes and hearts of\r\nthe many who do not always have the patience to\r\nwait until the benefits of the system materialize, who\r\ndespair and grow weary of dreaming dreams that are\r\ndifficult to attain.\r\n“For democracy to survive the times and to\r\njustify the high price that we have paid for it, it\r\nmust respond to the concerns and aspirations of\r\npeoples.” (A/54/PV.8, pp. 2-3)\r\nIt is this vision which must guide the international\r\ncommunity in supporting fully the efforts of the Central\r\nAmerican countries for economic growth and\r\ndevelopment to ensure a better life for, and the prosperity\r\nof, their citizens. The international community has a\r\ncrucial role to play in supporting these efforts. We\r\ntherefore support fully the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that debt relief should not be at the expense of\r\nofficial development assistance and that debt repayment\r\nby the poorest countries should never take precedence\r\nover the fulfilment of human needs.\r\nAn equitable and supportive international economic\r\nenvironment is essential for the growth and development\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nof all developing countries, especially the Central American\r\ncountries. Most of these countries, according to the World\r\nInvestment Report 1999, have a high “transnationality”\r\nindex, varying from about 10 per cent for Guatemala to\r\nnearly 21 per cent for Costa Rica. However imperfect the\r\ncomputation of this index, it stresses the overall\r\nsignificance of international production for these economies.\r\nWe were therefore happy to note in the same report that\r\nforeign direct investment inflows in many of these countries\r\nhave increased during 1998. We have also noted the\r\npositive assessment of the United Nations World Economic\r\nand Social Survey that the Central American countries\r\nwould generally grow at a higher rate in 1999. We also\r\nwelcome the continued commitment of Central American\r\nGovernments to the goal of establishing a free trade area of\r\nthe Americas by 2005. On the basis of our efforts in our\r\nregion, in the context of the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation, we recognize the advantages to be\r\ngained and productive energies to be released through the\r\ncreation of free trade areas.\r\nWe note with appreciation the efforts of the\r\nGovernments of El Salvador and Guatemala, in cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations, to make major advances in the\r\nimplementation of the peace accords. We also welcome the\r\nactivities of United Nations funds and programmes to\r\naddress, in a collaborative manner and in response to\r\nnational requests, the developmental needs of Central\r\nAmerica.\r\nWe share the view of the Secretary-General in\r\nparagraph 57 of his report (A/54/311) that at this stage of\r\nconsolidating peace and democracy, we should not\r\nunderestimate the difficulties, particularly in reconciling the\r\nimperatives of economic growth, stability and equity.\r\nGrowth with equity, in fact, is a common challenge faced\r\nby all developing countries. We are therefore perplexed by\r\nthe proposal put forward to the lending institutions to\r\neffectively link debt relief and official assistance with\r\nurgently needed public spending for poverty alleviation and\r\nstrengthening of public institutions that aspire to guarantee\r\nrespect for human rights, democratic governance,\r\ntransparency, participation and the rule of law. All of these\r\nare important and must be promoted, but the case for\r\nlinkage between debt relief and official assistance, on the\r\none hand, with human rights and the rest, on the other, is\r\nnot convincing. The basic problem is gross inequality in the\r\nCentral American States, which should be addressed\r\nthrough the alleviation of poverty in the region.\r\nWe are convinced that fulfilling basic human needs\r\nand improving quality of life are the main objectives of any\r\ndevelopmental process. While the international community\r\nmust assist in realizing the cherished objectives of peace\r\nand prosperity in the Central American region, the actual\r\nimpetus comes from the Central American countries\r\nthemselves. Their recent successes in charting an even\r\ncourse, despite external vagaries, rekindles great hopes.\r\nWe believe that the wisdom and sagacity of the Central\r\nAmerican countries will result in their ever-growing\r\nprosperity. India would be privileged to be a partner in\r\nthis enterprise.\r\nMr. Bivero (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme first of all to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport on the situation in Central America, submitted\r\npursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/94. I share\r\nhis analysis of the progress made by the Central\r\nAmerican countries in the areas of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development.\r\nIn evaluating the current situation, we wish first of\r\nall to congratulate the Governments of the countries\r\nfriendly to the region for their continued efforts, in the\r\naftermath of long and costly conflicts, to build politically,\r\neconomically and socially renewed societies. Their\r\nachievements are worthy of the full support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAs the Secretary-General indicates, the noteworthy\r\ncontrast between the past and the present situation is\r\nevident in the consolidation of democratic pluralism and\r\nin the renewed impetus given to regional integration.\r\nBeyond that, it can be seen in the continuing\r\ncommitment — in spite of all the difficulties involved,\r\nincluding those imposed on the region by sizeable natural\r\ndisasters, such as hurricane Mitch last year — to\r\novercome the fundamental causes of conflicts, while at\r\nthe same time launching projects such as the Alliance for\r\nSustainable Development and the Central American\r\nUnion. Venezuela salutes the vision and leadership of the\r\nCentral American heads of State, their Governments and\r\ncivil societies, which throughout recent years have\r\nendorsed not only commitments to peace and national\r\nreconciliation, but also the aim of constructing a region of\r\nfull peace, freedom, democracy and development.\r\nUndoubtedly problems remain, as do outstanding\r\nissues of greater or lesser import in one or another of the\r\ncountries of the region that have experienced conflicts.\r\nVenezuela is guided in this matter by the scope of the\r\nnegotiated peace treaties and wishes to reiterate its\r\nappreciation to the United Nations for its critical role of\r\nsupport, follow-up and verification, according to each\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nsituation, in areas such as human rights, public security,\r\nhuman settlements, land ownership, social integration and\r\nadvancement of women, among others, which contribute\r\ndirectly or indirectly to consolidating the firm and lasting\r\npeace that the countries of the region, individually and\r\ncollectively, have aimed to achieve. In this context, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, in the case of El\r\nSalvador, and the United Nations Verification Mission in\r\nGuatemala play roles of great importance and deserve the\r\ncontinued support of the international community.\r\nSimilarly, Venezuela wishes to reiterate its firm\r\ncommitment to continue contributing, within its ability, to\r\nrehabilitation, rebuilding and development of the countries\r\nof the region. Following the devastation caused by\r\nhurricane Mitch, we are participating in the process of the\r\nConsultative Group on Reconstruction and Transformation\r\nin Central America, initiated in Washington in 1998, and,\r\nin the framework of the San José Agreement, we are\r\ncontributing with special facilities for easing terms of\r\nfinancing for development projects that we are carrying out\r\nin the countries most affected. We are pleased to remain\r\ncooperative partners in the important process of political\r\ndialogue and economic cooperation that for years has been\r\ntaking place between the European Union and Central\r\nAmerica, known as the San José dialogue, in the framework\r\nof which, without prejudice to the most complete respect\r\nfor and the special nature and scope of relations between\r\nthe two regions, we can benefit as a country from more\r\ndirect contact with the realities and interests of the region\r\nand from the efforts of the international community to\r\naddress them.\r\nIn these and other cases, the growing practice of\r\nregional and international coordination and consultation\r\nallows us to better focus our cooperation and to try to\r\nensure that our bilateral efforts have a common viewpoint,\r\nwhich is implicit in the regional project that the countries\r\nof the region are undertaking under the general coordination\r\nof the Central American Integration System and which is\r\nnecessary for consolidating peace.\r\nAs the Secretary-General indicates in his report, one\r\nmust not underestimate the difficulties in the path of\r\ncountries of the region in “reconciling the imperatives of\r\neconomic growth, stability and equity”. (A/54/311, para.57)\r\nVenezuela supports a continuing commitment by the\r\ninternational community to peace and development in\r\nCentral America.\r\nFinally, I would like to announce that we wish to join\r\nas a sponsor of draft resolution A/54/L.24/Rev.1, on the\r\nsituation in Central America, which was introduced to the\r\nAssembly by the delegation of Colombia.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for\r\nproviding us with two excellent and detailed reports, on\r\nthe situation in Central America and on the work of the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA).\r\nJapan is pleased that at the meeting of the\r\nConsultative Group on Reconstruction and Transformation\r\nin Central America held in Stockholm last May, the\r\nvolume of pledges made by donors, including Japan, well\r\nexceeded the amount expected. This is a clear\r\nmanifestation of the international community\u0027s continuing\r\ngreat attention to this region.\r\nTurning our attention to political development in\r\nCentral America, Japan particularly welcomed the\r\npresidential election held in Guatemala on 7 November\r\nwith a high voter turnout, and we hope that the second\r\nround, scheduled for 26 December, will also be conducted\r\nin a fair and peaceful manner.\r\nJapan gives its full support to the active participation\r\nof the United Nations in Central America, and in\r\nparticular to the continued presence of MINUGUA in\r\nGuatemala. Since its establishment, MINUGUA has made\r\na vital contribution to maintaining the peace process at\r\nthe forefront of Guatemala\u0027s political agenda. In this\r\nconnection, I wish to express Japan\u0027s support for the draft\r\nresolution before the Assembly to extend the mandate of\r\nMINUGUA to 31 December 2000.\r\nAs regards the situation in El Salvador, that country\r\nhas been pursuing the democratization process on its own\r\nsince the withdrawal of the major component of the\r\nMission of the United Nations in El Salvador\r\n(MINUSAL) in April 1996. Japan pays tribute to the\r\nGovernment and the people of El Salvador for having\r\nconducted the presidential election in a peaceful manner\r\nin March this year. This was a manifestation of the\r\nprogress that has been made in the democratization\r\nprocess in that country.\r\nPeace and democracy cannot be fully consolidated\r\nunless they are supported by development efforts. Central\r\nAmerica still faces enormous challenges, such as the\r\nalleviation of poverty, the promotion of social justice and\r\nrespect for human rights. My Government is deeply\r\nconcerned that Central America\u0027s efforts to achieve\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\ndemocratization, economic liberalization and poverty\r\neradication have been curtailed in the aftermath of\r\nhurricane Mitch, which hit the region a year ago. To\r\nsupport the international relief efforts, Japan extended more\r\nthan $6.6 million in immediate emergency relief assistance.\r\nJapan also dispatched a 205-member disaster relief team to\r\nHonduras and a 16-member medical team to Nicaragua. At\r\nthe Consultative Group meeting in Stockholm, Japan\r\nannounced that by the end of 1999 it would disburse to the\r\nfour Central American countries affected by hurricane\r\nMitch $300 million worth of assistance to support their\r\nreconstruction efforts. Today I am pleased to announce that\r\nmy Government has almost fulfilled this pledge.\r\nThe Guatemala peace agreements signed in December\r\n1996 completed the peace process of Central America and\r\npaved the way for the political stability of the region. In\r\norder to achieve economically and socially stable societies,\r\nissues such as poverty alleviation and improvement in\r\nsocial welfare have to be resolved in the next millennium.\r\nIn this connection, I wish to affirm Japan\u0027s continued\r\nsupport for the reconstruction efforts of Central American\r\ncountries. My delegation also sincerely hopes that the\r\ninternational community will continue to support the\r\ndemocratization and development efforts of these countries.\r\nMr. McLean (United States of America): As a strong\r\nsupporter of the peace process and as a member of the\r\nGroup of Friends of Guatemala, the United States supports\r\nthe draft resolution to extend the mandate of the United\r\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) to\r\n31 December 2000. In compliance with United Nations\r\nprinciples and peacekeeping objectives, MINUGUA has\r\nplayed an integral role in encouraging peace and national\r\nharmony in Guatemala in accordance with the 1996 peace\r\naccords. It has promoted human rights, strengthened the\r\ndemocratic process and helped give voice to many sectors\r\nof Guatemalan society that had none. It continues to\r\npromote positive legislative and administrative reforms.\r\nMy Government does not see MINUGUA as a\r\npermanent Mission or as one whose mandate should be\r\nextended repeatedly or indefinitely. However, we are at a\r\ncrucial juncture in the implementation of the peace accords.\r\nGuatemalans have elected a new congress and will\r\ncomplete the process of electing a President on 26\r\nDecember. With a new Government due to take office in\r\nGuatemala in January, we believe it is appropriate to extend\r\nMINUGUA. Significant advances in human and worker\r\nrights, as well as in the participation of civil society, have\r\nbeen achieved, but the year 2000 will be critical in\r\nconsolidating the progress. Extending its mandate to the end\r\nof 2000 will enable MINUGUA to work with the new\r\nGovernment during its first, crucial year in office,\r\nencouraging it to continue the peace process and to\r\nimplement fully the peace accords. We believe this will\r\nhelp solidify the progress MINUGUA and the Guatemalan\r\npeople have made thus far, provide needed time to\r\nstrengthen the institutions necessary to continue the\r\nprocess after MINUGUA leaves the scene and ensure\r\npeace and stability in the country in the future.\r\nMINUGUA has been a very successful Mission. It\r\nhas helped to increase political participation and equality\r\nfor Guatemalan women and to integrate the country\u0027s\r\nindigenous population into national life. It worked with\r\nhuman rights groups to create commissions within the\r\nGovernment and the armed forces to monitor human\r\nrights abuses and to modernize the judicial system.\r\nMINUGUA works with other organizations to maintain\r\ncentres to provide health care to the poor and to promote\r\neducational reform and universal schooling.\r\nExtending MINUGUA\u0027s mandate for another year\r\nwill continue the process of reconciliation and\r\nreconstruction that Guatemala and its people so badly\r\nneed. We encourage the new Government of Guatemala\r\nto work closely with MINUGUA to ensure that the peace\r\naccords are fully implemented.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation welcomes the significant progress made in the\r\nconsolidation of the peace process in Central America.\r\nTwelve years after the historic Esquipulas II agreement,\r\nthe countries of the isthmus are firmly on the road to\r\nbecoming stable and prosperous societies within the\r\nframework of invigorated democratic institutions and\r\nrestructured economies. The free and open elections\r\nrecently held in Guatemala, El Salvador and Panama\r\nattest eloquently to the high degree of institutional\r\nmaturity achieved in the region.\r\nThere remain, of course, considerable difficulties and\r\nchallenges ahead that reflect the complex nature of the\r\nprofound changes under way in these countries. A\r\nsustained and determined effort is necessary if the\r\nnational peace agreements are to be fully implemented,\r\nparticularly as concerns the fostering and protection of\r\nhuman rights, equal opportunities and judicial, fiscal and\r\nagrarian reform.\r\nThe first and most important step is the\r\nconsolidation of peace and ending the culture of violence.\r\nWe welcome the “peace encounter” held in Guatemala as\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nwell as the work of the Commission for Historical\r\nClarification, which seeks to mobilize public opinion\r\naround the issue of the peace accords and the need for\r\nnational reconciliation. It is necessary to secure full\r\ninternational support for these efforts in order to foster\r\neconomic and social change. Improving the living\r\nconditions of the population is a fundamental pillar of\r\nlasting peace and democracy.\r\nThe economic vulnerability of the Central American\r\ncountries has serious consequences for the most\r\nunderprivileged sectors of society. The devastating impact\r\nof last year\u0027s hurricane Mitch only made things worse. We\r\napplaud the determination of these countries to pool their\r\nefforts to deal with the economic and social challenges\r\nahead. In their recent joint declaration, the Presidents of the\r\nCentral American countries expressed their resolve to\r\nundertake coordinated action on such crucial issues as\r\nprotecting the human rights of migrants, combating drug\r\ntrafficking and moving forward towards regional economic\r\nintegration. A positive illustration of this regional spirit of\r\ncooperation are the measures undertaken by El Salvador\r\nand Honduras and by Belize and Guatemala to settle once\r\nand for all their differences on border demarcation.\r\nThe recognition of the need for common action also\r\ninspired the May 1999 Declaration of Stockholm, whereby\r\nthe member countries of the Consultative Group on\r\nReconstruction and Transformation underscored their\r\ncommitment to helping Central America at this critical\r\ntime. Aware of the need to maintain sustained assistance to\r\nthe region, the United Nations for its part will continue to\r\nmonitor, through the United Nations Verification Mission\r\nin Guatemala (MINUGUA), compliance with the schedule\r\nset out for the peace process in Guatemala. At the same\r\ntime, the United Nations Development Programme will\r\npursue its activities aimed at reducing the ecological and\r\nsocial vulnerability of the region and at helping to\r\nconsolidate democracy and good governance.\r\nBrazil has played an active part in the efforts to\r\nachieve peace and development for Central America. Brazil\r\nwas active in the Support Group of the Contadora process.\r\nBrazil has made police units and liaison officers available\r\nto MINUGUA. It is also involved in the joint mission of\r\nthe Inter-American Defense Board and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States presently doing demining work in Costa\r\nRica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.\r\nIn response to the significant human and material\r\nlosses resulting from hurricane Mitch, the Brazilian\r\nGovernment contributed to the ensuing humanitarian\r\nassistance efforts. Brazil donated 18 tons of medical\r\nsupplies to the four countries hardest hit and sent a\r\nreconnaissance mission to evaluate the infrastructure\r\ndamage suffered by Honduras and Nicaragua.\r\nFurthermore, recognizing that the foreign debt burden\r\nrepresents one of the main impediments to the structural\r\nreform necessary to sustained growth and social and\r\ninstitutional stability, the President of Brazil has submitted\r\nto Congress a proposal to cancel the sovereign debts of\r\nNicaragua and El Salvador to my country.\r\nThe successes already achieved in the Central\r\nAmerican peace process are grounds for optimism and\r\nconfidence. I am convinced that these achievements will\r\nmotivate the countries of the region, with the help and\r\nsolidarity of the international community, to persevere in\r\ntheir struggle for lasting peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Duval (Canada) (spoke in French): Canada is\r\npleased to co-sponsor the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/54/L.27, which would extend the mandate of\r\nthe United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA) for a further 12 months. We take this\r\nopportunity to thank all the men and women of\r\nMINUGUA for their valuable work in difficult and\r\nsometimes dangerous circumstances. MINUGUA\r\ncontinues to play a valuable role in support of the\r\nGuatemalan peace process and is an important indicator\r\nof the international community\u0027s willingness to support\r\nthe desire of the people of Guatemala for a just and\r\nsustainable peace.\r\nIt is understandable that Canada should wish to\r\nfurther enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of\r\nMINUGUA and hopes to work with the friends of\r\nGuatemala and other interested parties in the coming year.\r\nThe issues that Canada looks forward to addressing\r\ninclude the maximization of the civilian police component\r\nand the streamlining of MINUGUA\u0027s administration.\r\nMINUGUA retains characteristics and components\r\nthat are essentially derived from peacekeeping. It is\r\ntherefore important, for the sake of continuity and\r\nefficiency, that, in addition to the guidance and expertise\r\nof the Department of Political Affairs, a reporting\r\nmechanism also be established with the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations. MINUGUA could then draw\r\nupon the considerable expertise of the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations to ensure that the civilian police\r\nmaximize their contribution to the peace in Guatemala.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIt is also essential that MINUGUA police be given a\r\nclearly defined role to assist in human rights verification.\r\nAs a police contributor to MINUGUA, Canada wishes to\r\nensure that international police are able to offer useful\r\ntraining in such areas as community-based policing and\r\nrespect for human rights. MINUGUA police could also\r\nprovide field training and mentoring to the Guatemala\r\nNational Police in order to utilize their expertise to best\r\nadvantage.\r\nFinally, we hope to examine ways in which to\r\nimprove the administration of MINUGUA in order to\r\nensure that the mission operates in a manner as efficient\r\nand cost-effective as possible. In this regard, one suggestion\r\nCanada would like to discuss with other member States in\r\nthe coming year is the establishment of the position of chief\r\nadministrator, with overall budgetary authority.\r\nMINUGUA plays an essential role in the Guatemalan\r\npeace process and is a model for other United Nations\r\npolitical/peace-building missions. I note in the latter regard\r\nthat the United Nations Mission in the Central African\r\nRepublic, the United Nations Mission of Observers in\r\nTajikistan and the United Nations Civilian Police Mission\r\nin Haiti will all soon be transformed from peacekeeping\r\ninto post-peacekeeping or peace-building operations.\r\nCanada\u0027s aim is to ensure that MINUGUA sets the most\r\neffective and efficient example possible for these and\r\nfurther missions.\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): For\r\nyears the General Assembly has devoted a day to\r\nconsidering the situation of peace, democracy and\r\ndevelopment in Central America. The Argentine delegation\r\nconsiders it an unavoidable responsibility and a great\r\nhonour to speak whenever this item is under consideration,\r\nbecause Central America is closely bound to the history and\r\nthe future of the people of Argentina.\r\nThe Argentine Republic has contributed to the peace\r\nprocess begun in Central America since its inception a\r\ndecade and a half ago, which was crystallized in the signing\r\nof the Esquipulas II agreements of 7 August 1987.\r\nArgentina believed it a duty to make every effort to find\r\nsolutions to the problems of the region and was moved by\r\nthe distressing internal situation of the Central American\r\npeople and convinced that these sisterly nations simply\r\nneeded a framework of peace in which to be able to\r\nrecover and begin their economic development.\r\nWhen the conflict was resolved, the recovery was\r\nsurprising. Democratic practices were promptly restored\r\nand societies marked out paths towards reconciliation and\r\nnational unity. In the space of a few years we have seen\r\nhow they have learned to channel disagreement through\r\nrepublican mechanisms, in a framework of the rule of law\r\nand with respect for the principles of democratic\r\ngovernance, independent justice and public freedoms.\r\nThis democratic recovery, this choice of a culture of\r\npeace and tolerance, could be taken as an example by\r\nmany other regions suffering chronic conflicts from which\r\nthey are not able to easily extricate themselves. Healing\r\nwounds requires generations, but Central America has\r\ndone it in a single generation. It has shown us in a\r\nsurprising fashion that rapid progress towards coexistence,\r\nunderstanding, development, national reconciliation and\r\ninternational reintegration is possible.\r\nHowever, the situation in Central America is far\r\nfrom optimal. In 1998 an unprecedented climatic disaster\r\nshattered many lives and disrupted the infrastructure of\r\nvast areas of the region. In many countries the system of\r\neconomic production was almost completely dismantled\r\nand still has not been fully restored. The tragedy of\r\nhurricane Mitch was a heavy blow to the possibility of\r\nrecovery and development, because it meant that the aid\r\nprovided had to be diverted, thus preventing resources\r\nfrom being applied to economic investment. This tragedy\r\nis compounded by the well-known structural economic\r\nproblems of developing countries, in particular\r\ndependency on commodities whose prices continue to\r\ndecline, the use of subsidies and para-tariff restrictions on\r\nimports of their products into developed markets.\r\nCentral America does not only need direct\r\nassistance. It also needs its products to have access to the\r\nmarkets of the developed countries. It needs the\r\ndeveloped world to take relief measures relating to its\r\nexternal debt, such as those so generously adopted by\r\nCanada last year. It needs the countries with resources to\r\nparticipate in the efforts being made by the Central\r\nAmerican countries. Argentina is here today, as always,\r\nto testify to our commitment to these purposes.\r\nMr. Pérez-Otermin (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nSixteen years have elapsed since the General Assembly\r\nfirst included this item on its agenda, and since then we\r\nhave witnessed deep and very positive changes taking\r\nplace in the region.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nPolitical, social and economic transformation now\r\npresent us with a Central America free from armed conflict,\r\na Central America with strengthened democratic institutions\r\nand a Central America in which peace, the protection of\r\nhuman rights and regional integration have been established\r\non a solid footing. This dynamic transformation of the\r\nregion has been possible essentially because of the efforts\r\nof the peoples and the Governments of the region, although\r\nwe must also recognize and value the significant role\r\nplayed by the peacekeeping operations and verification and\r\nobserver missions that the United Nations has been\r\ndeploying there since 1989.\r\nAs a country that contributes troops to peacekeeping\r\noperations missions, Uruguay has unswervingly supported\r\nthe activities of the United Nations Verification Mission in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA), whose basic function is to ensure\r\nfull implementation of the peace agreements over a four-\r\nyear period, until the end of the year 2000. We have been\r\nparticularly pleased to witness the process of cooperation\r\nand integration that our Central American brothers, with a\r\nlofty and profound democratic spirit, have articulated in the\r\nNicaragua Declaration of 1997 and in the Esquipulas\r\nagreements. It is because of these efforts that peace and\r\nstability have finally prevailed throughout Central America.\r\nMr. Stanislaus (Grenada), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nFinally, we wish to reiterate what Uruguay has\r\nrepeatedly advocated: there can be no peace without\r\ndevelopment. For this reason, cooperation on the part of the\r\ninternational community is more necessary now than ever\r\nin order to ensure further consolidation of the peace\r\nprocess. In this regard, Uruguay reaffirms its far-reaching\r\nsolidarity with our Central American brothers, with the aim\r\nof ensuring that we all work together for a peaceful,\r\ndemocratic, integrated and prosperous Latin America. The\r\nsupport and encouragement of the Government and the\r\npeople of my country can always be counted on.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): The Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Finland has already spoken in this debate\r\non behalf of the European Union. My country fully\r\nassociates itself with her statement. Nevertheless, I wish to\r\nmake some additional remarks, as Spain is a member of the\r\nGroup of Friends of the Secretary-General for the Central\r\nAmerican countries.\r\nSpain continues to support the implementation of the\r\nDecember 1996 Guatemala peace agreements. Progress has\r\nbeen made since their negotiation thanks to the commitment\r\nand the efforts of the various sectors of Guatemalan\r\nsociety and of its political representatives. In spite of the\r\ndisappointing results of the popular referendum last May,\r\nSpain trusts that that commitment will continue during the\r\nelectoral process now under way in Guatemala, as well as\r\nafterwards, in the renewal of the democratic institutions.\r\nSince the signing of the agreements, the United\r\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA)\r\nhas been an essential element in the implementation\r\nprocess and an important signal of the interest with which\r\nthe international community is following this process.\r\nSpain is proud to have participated very actively in\r\nMINUGUA from the outset, and, after Guatemala itself,\r\nSpain is the country that has the greatest number of\r\nnationals in the Mission. We trust that the General\r\nAssembly will renew the mandate until the end of the\r\nyear 2000.\r\nA year ago hurricane Mitch was wreaking havoc on\r\na significant part of the Central American isthmus and\r\nleaving in its wake a human tragedy of enormous\r\nmagnitude. The international community reacted swiftly.\r\nThe meeting that the Consultative Group held in\r\nStockholm last May laid the basis for cooperation in\r\nreconstruction, while at the same time it established some\r\ncommon objectives and principles, as expressed in the\r\nStockholm Declaration of 28 May. Just as we urged the\r\nCentral American countries to put into practice the\r\ncommitments undertaken, we also trust that the donor\r\ncountries will be able promptly to honour the\r\ncontributions pledged.\r\nPrecisely in order to ensure that the process thus\r\nbegun does not lose its initial momentum, a follow-up\r\nmechanism to the Stockholm Declaration was established\r\nin Madrid on 13 September, and Spain is pleased at\r\npresent to act as its secretariat pro tempore.\r\nSpain has supported and joined in the efforts that the\r\nEuropean Union has made from the very outset to\r\ncooperate with the affected countries through\r\nhumanitarian assistance and assistance for reconstruction.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI should like to inform members that action on draft\r\nresolutions A/54/L.24/Rev.1 and A/54/L.27 will be taken\r\nat a later date, to allow time for a review of the\r\nprogramme budget implications of the two draft\r\nresolutions.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nAgenda item 21\r\nUniversity for Peace\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/312)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.30)\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/54/L.30.\r\nMs. Vargas (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): I am\r\nhonoured to address the General Assembly under agenda\r\nitem 21, entitled “University for Peace”, on behalf of the\r\nCentral American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador,\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as\r\nthe Dominican Republic.\r\nThe University for Peace was created by the United\r\nNations General Assembly on 5 December 1980, and its\r\nprimary purpose is the quest for peace through education.\r\nIt is guided by the tenets of the United Nations Charter and\r\npromotes the principles of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights and its own charter.\r\nPeace, education, communication, consultation and\r\nhuman rights are the focuses of the University\u0027s\r\nprogrammes. Factors that have a direct or indirect impact\r\non peace, such as the environment, natural resources,\r\nsustainable development, quality of life, technology and\r\ninternational relations, are studied in terms of their real\r\nimpact on peace and not as isolated topics. Since its\r\nestablishment by the General Assembly in resolution 35/55\r\non 4 December 1980, the University has worked with\r\ndedication to develop the programmes and activities\r\nstemming from its mandate, which has become increasingly\r\nessential, given the state of violence and armed conflict\r\nprevailing in many parts of the world, even at the threshold\r\nof the new millennium.\r\nThus, as an international centre specialized in peace its\r\nactivities in post-university education, research,\r\ndissemination and worldwide promotion of knowledge may\r\nbe regarded as a response to this obvious and urgent\r\nnecessity. There is no question that this is a challenge to\r\nthe University. We are grateful for the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport contained in document A/54/312. The report gives an\r\naccount of the various activities carried out by the\r\nUniversity for Peace, and the difficulties that it has\r\nencountered in implementing them. The report furthermore\r\nindicates the means used by the Secretary-General, the\r\nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the\r\nCouncil of the University to bolster cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the University for Peace.\r\nOverriding importance has been given to three\r\nclosely interrelated issues: financial support, political\r\nsupport and revitalization of the University. We support\r\nand appreciate these measures and the focus on the future.\r\nFor 19 years now the University has been\r\nimplementing Master\u0027s degree programmes in the fields of\r\ninternational relations, ecology and communication for\r\npeace. It has also carried out extensive work in the areas\r\nof peaceful settlement of conflicts, consensus-building,\r\nsocial and labour consultation and the international\r\ntraining of indigenous leaders.\r\nIn Central America, the University has cooperated in\r\nthe peacemaking process through projects of education for\r\npeace, culture of peace, human rights, conflict resolution\r\ntechniques and promotion of democracy.\r\nTo date, 33 countries have signed its International\r\nAgreement, and throughout its history the institution has\r\nreceived financial support from the Governments of\r\nSpain, Italy, Denmark, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands\r\nand the Governments of the Central American republics\r\nand Uruguay. It has also received contributions from\r\ninternational agencies, non-governmental organizations\r\nand interested individuals.\r\nDuring the first half of 1997 the World Centre for\r\nResearch and Information on Peace was set up in\r\nMontevideo, Uruguay. The development of that Centre\r\nwas possible thanks to the generous support extended by\r\nthe Government of the President of the Republic of\r\nUruguay, Mr. Julio María Sanguinetti.\r\nIn the light of the recent commemoration of the\r\ntenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild — whose interest in the area of peace relates in\r\nparticular to the protection of children in armed\r\nconflict — we wish to express the hope that the\r\nUniversity for Peace will include this priority in its\r\nprogrammes to promote peace in the world. We hope that\r\nthis noble purpose will be achieved in the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nI would now like to take this opportunity to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/54/L.30 on behalf of the\r\nStates of Central America, including Panama, as well as\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nthe Dominican Republic. As with previous draft resolutions\r\non this item, we hope that it will be adopted by consensus\r\nby the General Assembly. I would also like to thank the\r\nPresident for agreeing to our request.\r\nI am now pleased to introduce the draft resolution on\r\nbehalf of the following sponsors: Afghanistan, Algeria,\r\nAndorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bangladesh,\r\nBarbados, Belarus, Belize, Bolivia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile,\r\nColombia, the Comoros, the Congo, Costa Rica,\r\nCôte d\u0027Ivoire, Cuba, Cyprus, Djibouti, Dominica, the\r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador,\r\nEquatorial Guinea, Georgia, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala,\r\nGuyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica,\r\nKazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique,\r\nNicaragua, Norway, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the\r\nPhilippines, Poland, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Romania,\r\nthe Russian Federation, San Marino, Senegal, Seychelles,\r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Solomon Islands, Spain, the Sudan,\r\nSuriname, Tajikistan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nTunisia, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and\r\nVenezuela.\r\nThe draft resolution recounts in its preambular\r\nparagraphs the history of the University for Peace, from its\r\nestablishment by the General Assembly in resolutions\r\n34/111 of 14 December 1979 and 35/55 of 4 December\r\n1980, to resolution 50/41 of 8 December 1995, which\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to consider ways to\r\nstrengthen cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nUniversity for Peace.\r\nThe sixth preambular paragraph recalls the recent\r\nadoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace. Pursuant to\r\nthis mandate, the University has collaborated with\r\nUNESCO in promoting the culture of peace.\r\nThe draft resolution also notes the establishment, with\r\nthe assistance of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, of a Trust Fund for Peace by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Javier Pérez de Cuéllar consisting of voluntary\r\ncontributions to provide the University with the necessary\r\nmeans to fulfil its mandate.\r\nThe text notes with appreciation that by agreement\r\nwith the University for Peace, the Government of Uruguay\r\nin 1997 established a World Centre for Research and\r\nInformation on Peace as regional sub-headquarters of the\r\nUniversity for Peace for South America.\r\nIt also notes with appreciation the actions taken by\r\nthe Secretary-General, in consultation with the Director-\r\nGeneral of UNESCO and with the support of the\r\nGovernment of Costa Rica, to revitalize the University for\r\nPeace.\r\nThe subsequent preambular paragraphs highlight the\r\nvaried and important activities carried out by the\r\nUniversity through its various programmes during the\r\nperiod from 1997 to 1999. The text takes note of the\r\nprogramme to create a culture of peace in Central\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean within the context of the\r\nefforts being made by the United Nations and UNESCO\r\nfor the development and promotion of a culture of peace.\r\nThe text also recognizes the preparations for a symposium\r\nin celebration of the International Year of Older Persons,\r\n1999, to emphasize the valuable contribution that older\r\npersons can make to the promotion of peace, solidarity,\r\ntolerance and the culture of peace.\r\nThe draft resolution refers to the importance of\r\npromoting education for peace that fosters respect for the\r\nvalues inherent in peace and universal coexistence among\r\npersons, including respect for life, the dignity and\r\nintegrity of human beings and friendship and solidarity\r\namong peoples without any distinction as to nationality,\r\nrace, sex, religion or culture.\r\nIn the operative paragraph of resolution 52/15 of 20\r\nNovember 1997, the General Assembly declared the year\r\n2000 the International Year for the Culture of Peace. In\r\nconformity with that paragraph, we kindly ask that an\r\noperative paragraph be included in the draft resolution\r\nbefore the Assembly today to say,\r\n“Invites Member States, intergovernmental\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and\r\nthe peoples of the world to celebrate One Day in\r\nPeace, 1 January 2000”.\r\nIn its operative part, the draft resolution takes note\r\nwith appreciation of the Secretary-General\u0027s report,\r\ncontained in document A/54/312, on measures to\r\nstrengthen cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe University for Peace.\r\nThe following paragraph requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to consider using the services of the University\r\nfor Peace in his conflict-resolution and peace-building\r\nefforts, given the valuable contribution the University can\r\nmake in this regard.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nParagraphs 3 and 4 invite Member States,\r\nintergovernmental bodies, non-governmental organizations\r\nand interested individuals to contribute directly to the Trust\r\nFund for Peace or to the budget of the University. Member\r\nStates are also invited to accede to the international\r\nAgreement for the Establishment of the University for\r\nPeace, thereby demonstrating their support for an\r\neducational institution devoted to the promotion of universal\r\npeace.\r\nThe last paragraph decides to include in the\r\nprovisional agenda of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsixth session the item entitled “University for Peace”.\r\nWhen we speak of peace we are speaking about love;\r\nwe are speaking about tolerance; we are speaking about\r\nunited families; and we are speaking about brotherly\r\npeoples. The University for Peace helps us build this\r\ndream.\r\nIn closing, we would like to express our hope that this\r\ndraft resolution will be welcomed by the General Assembly\r\nand that, like the resolutions of previous years, it will be\r\nadopted without a vote.\r\nMr. Suh (Republic of Korea): At the outset, allow me\r\nto extend my delegation\u0027s appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the University for Peace\r\n(A/54/312). I would like to express my gratitude to Mrs.\r\nNury Vargas of Costa Rica for introducing the draft\r\nresolution before us. My thanks go also to Mr. Maurice\r\nStrong, the new Rector and the President of the Council of\r\nthe University for his briefing last Monday.\r\nAs is well known, the University for Peace was\r\nestablished by a General Assembly resolution in 1980 to\r\nprovide higher education for peace to students from various\r\ncountries. This University is unique, as it is a global\r\ninstitute established by the United Nations and the only\r\nuniversity to give a degree in peace studies. Its central goal\r\nis to promote a spirit of understanding, tolerance and\r\npeaceful coexistence among peoples. In view of the fact\r\nthat next year is designated as the “International Year for\r\nthe Culture of Peace”, the role of the University and the\r\nneed to implement its mandate are stronger than ever\r\nbefore.\r\nDespite the unique character of the University for\r\nPeace and its noble aspirations, it has undergone over the\r\npast few years a reduction in its activities, mainly due to\r\nfinancial constraints. However, we note with satisfaction\r\nthat the University is now on the road to revitalization, an\r\naccomplishment that is linked to the follow-up of the\r\nreform of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation would like to take this occasion to\r\nwelcome the newly appointed President, Mr. Maurice\r\nStrong, and other members of the Council. We are\r\npleased to note that the revitalization process has been\r\nback on track since last March. In this regard, we would\r\nlike to commend the numerous initiatives and efforts of\r\nthe President and other members of the Council. It is our\r\nsincere hope that the Council meeting scheduled for the\r\nbeginning of next week will be a milestone in launching\r\nthe new University for Peace.\r\nLet me make a few comments and suggestions with\r\nregard to the University\u0027s current programmes and\r\nactivities. We must envision a new way of ensuring\r\npeace, since peace cannot be equated simply with the\r\nabsence of violence but requires the elimination of the\r\nroot causes of conflict. Although the current programmes\r\nof the University have fulfilled the global mission\r\nentrusted to it by the United Nations, we are pleased to\r\nnote that prospective programmes have gone a step\r\nfurther to address the theme of peace realistically and\r\ncomprehensively.\r\nMoreover, we concur with the promising initiative to\r\nappoint people of exceptional experience and standing in\r\nthe field of peace negotiations as Fellows of the\r\nUniversity.\r\nMy delegation would like to add that the University\r\nwould surely be more successful if it set up virtual\r\nacademic networks with other universities and institutes\r\nthrough the exchange of students, faculties and credits.\r\nFurthermore, these networks could be further reinforced\r\nthrough interactive teleconferencing and Internet\r\nprogramming.\r\nIn the light of extensive measures under way to\r\nfirmly set the University for Peace on a strong platform,\r\nadequate and proportionate financial support from various\r\nsources is required. Hence, it would be worthwhile to\r\ncome up with incentives to channel private contributions\r\nto the University.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea\r\ncontributed funding and equipment to the University upon\r\nits establishment. My Government remains committed to\r\nassisting the University for the future of its work. In this\r\nvein, my Government has co-sponsored the draft\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nresolution on “University for Peace”, and we hope that it\r\nwill be adopted by consensus.\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nArgentina is honoured to co-sponsor the draft resolution on\r\nthe University for Peace. All the endeavours of recent years\r\nto end conflicts among peoples have demonstrated the need\r\nto build a culture of peace, based on humankind\u0027s\r\nprofoundest convictions, to replace the culture of violence\r\nand war.\r\nIn working towards this objective, the University for\r\nPeace has become particularly significant as an excellent\r\nenvironment for educating people in a spirit of\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence.\r\nIn this context, the institution has become particularly\r\nrelevant given the reality of societies affected by\r\nlongstanding conflicts which have opted for war as a way\r\nof life. In this regard the University has a significant\r\ncontribution to make to the international community.\r\nEducating for peace involves a sustained, long-term\r\nprocess that must be able to rely on adequate resources. In\r\nthis regard Argentina encourages Member States,\r\nintergovernmental agencies and non-governmental\r\norganizations to contribute directly to the Trust Fund for\r\nPeace or to the budget of the University.\r\nIf a greater number of States of the international\r\ncommunity become voluntarily involved in this project, the\r\nUniversity for Peace will have the means that it needs to\r\ndisseminate the values that it fosters and will be able to\r\ndesign more ambitious programmes, which will enable it to\r\nplay a greater role in the peace-building processes under\r\nway in various regions of the world.\r\nArgentina is committed to supporting any international\r\ninitiative to educate for peace, and we support the draft\r\nintroduced by Costa Rica because we believe that education\r\nfor peace is the first step towards instilling this concept as\r\na universal value.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Let me express at the\r\noutset our appreciation of the comprehensive, candid and\r\nfocused report of the Secretary-General on the University\r\nfor Peace (A/54/312). We have noted with satisfaction the\r\nactions taken by the Secretary-General to establish due\r\noversight and accountability in the areas of administration,\r\npersonnel and finance of the University.\r\nWe commend the steps taken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral towards revitalization of this noble institution.\r\nWe remain indebted to the Government of Costa Rica for\r\nits continued support for the University. The advice and\r\nsupport extended by Mr. Federico Mayor, the previous\r\nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), in\r\nstrengthening the institution deserves special\r\nacknowledgment.\r\nWe believe that with the assumption of the\r\npresidency of the Council of the University by Mr.\r\nMaurice Strong, there is naturally higher optimism and\r\ngreater confidence in the institution.\r\nBangladesh has co-sponsored draft resolutions on the\r\nUniversity for Peace ever since its inception in 1980. We\r\nhave done so this year for the draft resolution in\r\ndocument A/54/L.30, and urge the Assembly to adopt it\r\nby consensus. Here, my delegation would like to accord\r\nits full support to the proposal made by the representative\r\nof Costa Rica for the addition of a new operative\r\nparagraph relating to the observance of One Day in\r\nPeace, on 1 January 2000. We believe that this proposal\r\ndeserves our support, and we hope that it will be possible\r\nto obtain the support of the Assembly as a whole.\r\nWe recognize the role played by the University and\r\nshare the conviction that the institution can make an\r\neffective contribution to the cause of peace and well-\r\nbeing for humanity. The conflagrations around the world\r\nremind us of the necessity of research on and education\r\nin peace. The complexity of emerging conflicts demands\r\ngreater understanding of the factors determining the\r\ncourse of events in such situations.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the change envisaged in\r\nthe programme of the University. We have noted with\r\nsatisfaction that future programmes will be substantially\r\nexpanded to embrace a wider range of relevant themes.\r\nThe inclusion of such thematic areas as the universal\r\nculture of peace, the environment, economic development,\r\ndemocracy and the role of the media is a timely move in\r\nthe right direction.\r\nWe would like to see the University for Peace\r\nassume a truly universal character and a really global\r\nvocation. It should be able to attract people from all over\r\nthe world and assemble the broadest spectrum of people\r\nworking for peace. It should be able to demonstrate its\r\nrelevance to individuals — men, women and children —\r\nand to societies and nations in various parts of the world.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nWe believe that the United Nations Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace, adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly last September, has the potential to\r\nprovide useful guidance and substantive input with regard\r\nto the elaboration of the future programme and course\r\ncontents of the University for Peace. Each of the nine\r\nsections of the Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace\r\nmay constitute an area of study with reference to real and\r\npotential conflict situations. Such studies would provide\r\nextremely useful input for decision-making and action\r\naimed at preventing conflicts. We would also like to see\r\nthis document on a culture of peace included in the existing\r\nMaster\u0027s degree course in human rights and education for\r\npeace.\r\nWe are confident that the committed leadership of\r\nMr. Maurice Strong will make a special contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations Decade for Human Rights Education. In this\r\nregard, I would like to mention that, pursuant to the\r\ncommitment made at the Hague Appeal for Peace\r\nConference last May by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,\r\npeace and human rights education has been introduced at\r\nprimary and secondary school levels in Bangladesh. It is\r\nour earnest hope that the programmes of the University for\r\nPeace will foster and bring together such initiatives all over\r\nthe world.\r\nIt is disconcerting to see that the financial situation of\r\nthe University remains precarious. It is disappointing to\r\nnote that resource constraints have substantially curtailed\r\nthe activities of an institution established with lofty ideas.\r\nThe purpose for which the institution was established by\r\nthis Assembly about two decades ago remains valid. Let us\r\ngive to the University that we have established the means\r\nto achieve the objectives we have set for it.\r\nNo one disputes the dictum that prevention is better\r\nthan cure. We have calculated the costs of war too many\r\ntimes. History has repeated itself, and we have failed to\r\nlearn from experience. The human cost, which is\r\nimmeasurable, remains a heavy burden on our collective\r\nconscience. The expediency of support for preventive\r\ndiplomacy and peace-building efforts cannot therefore be\r\noveremphasized. In the final analysis, the casualty in every\r\nconflict is humanity. In the ultimate analysis, too, the cause\r\nis human. It should therefore not be too difficult for\r\nhumans to live in peace and let others live in peace. For\r\nthat we need the learning of peace, teaching of peace and\r\npreaching of peace — in short, a culture of peace. Given\r\nthe means, the University for Peace can greatly contribute\r\nto achieving this objective. There is no doubt that we would\r\nall like to see the University more actively involved in\r\nserving the cause of peace, the supreme objective\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It is\r\nequally true that it is our will and our attention that can\r\nmake the difference.\r\nMr. Belfort (Haiti) (spoke in French): I have the\r\nhonour to take the floor on behalf of the delegation of\r\nHaiti to voice the full support of the Republic of Haiti for\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.30, on strengthening cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the University for Peace,\r\nwhich has its headquarters in Costa Rica. I should also\r\nlike to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of\r\nthe people and the Government of Haiti, to the memory\r\nof all the women and men of goodwill who have fallen in\r\nthe service of peace and of the United Nations. As the\r\nAssembly knows, the University for Peace was\r\nestablished 19 years ago in order to provide humankind\r\nwith an institution of international scope dedicated to\r\nteaching, promotion and dissemination of the ideas of\r\npeace, peaceful coexistence and cooperation among\r\npeoples.\r\nAt a time when a kind of narrow realism still\r\ndominates the spirit and the current system of\r\ninternational relations, we cannot fail to pay tribute to and\r\nadmire the work being carried out by the officials of that\r\ninstitution of higher education, which, though at an early\r\nstage of its development, is nonetheless essential. As Pope\r\nJohn Paul II rightly said several years ago, peace is\r\nanother name for development. These two concepts have,\r\nin fact, become interconnected. Furthermore, the\r\nSecretary-General highlighted that fact very clearly in his\r\nreport in document A/54/312 on the University for Peace.\r\nParagraph 18, subparagraph (g) of that report states,\r\n“The linkages between economic development and\r\nthe preservation of peace are clearly of fundamental\r\nimportance ... The preservation of peace in the next\r\ncentury will depend on achieving more equitable\r\npatterns of economic development ... [and] reducing\r\npoverty ... and the grounds for conflict”.\r\nWith this wise comment, the Secretary-General\r\ntouched upon a critical element of the dynamics of inter-\r\nState relations, for so many of the conflicts that shake our\r\nworld and inflict grief on peoples result from a lack of\r\nsolidarity and a slow but sure process of exclusion.\r\nThe delegation of Haiti has taken good note of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General in document A/54/312,\r\nand we warmly thank him for it. Although it deals only\r\nwith those means envisaged to strengthen cooperation\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nbetween the United Nations and the University for Peace,\r\nan in-depth and dispassionate reading of the report will\r\nenable us to understand the real issues of the next\r\nmillennium that could be included within the notion of\r\nhuman security. This new notion will no doubt be at the\r\nheart of the problems of global society in the twenty-first\r\ncentury, for on a planet that is seeing the increasing\r\nestablishment of a new system for the creation of wealth\r\nbased on new technologies, the sight of a constantly\r\nwidening gap between the beneficiaries of the process of\r\nglobalization and those whom Frantz Fanon called the\r\ndamned of the earth will be more and more intolerable. In\r\na world still governed by a narrow realism, sometimes\r\nsterile but always destructive, it is clear that those who\r\nenvisage a better future for humanity will have much to do\r\nto definitively set in motion the dynamic of change that is\r\nso necessary for sustainable human development.\r\nIt is no doubt from this perspective that the philosophy\r\nunderlying the programme and action of the University for\r\nPeace is established. That institution has already been in\r\nexistence for 19 years, during which it has acquired a\r\ncertain maturity and has demonstrated the validity of its\r\nwork, which in turn has prompted the United Nations and\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) to take the necessary measures to\r\nrevitalize the University for Peace and to expand its\r\nprogrammes and means of action to allow it to carry out its\r\nfundamental mission, that of reducing obstacles and threats\r\nto peace and progress throughout the world — not by\r\nhaving recourse to the all too well-known Chapter VII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, but by appealing to all that is\r\nmost noble in human beings: the sense of solidarity, the\r\ndesire to commune with one\u0027s fellow human beings and\r\nwith nature, in a word, everything that gives humankind its\r\nmoral and spiritual value. In his Antimémoires, André\r\nMalraux suggests that the twenty-first century either will be\r\nreligious or will not be, religion here meaning the\r\nrelationship we have with the earth, with human beings and\r\nwith the cosmos. The Haitian delegation therefore takes this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the officials of the University\r\nfor Peace for having thought of including in their\r\ncurriculum the ethical and spiritual values that can serve as\r\nguidelines for the establishment of a genuine culture of\r\npeace.\r\nIn UNESCO\u0027s Constitution it is stated that “since wars\r\nbegin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that\r\nthe defences of peace must be constructed”. At the\r\nthreshold of the twenty-first century, it is the General\r\nAssembly that must make this University a major bulwark\r\nin the defence of peace. This will perhaps allow us to shed\r\nthe parochialism, the destructive and sterile egoisms that\r\ncontinue to cast a pall over mankind and allow the spread\r\nof the viruses of war and poverty. This is a University for\r\ndemocracy, for development and for peace.\r\nIn the face of the threats that continue to harm\r\nhuman security, the Haitian delegation renews its support\r\nfor the University for Peace and its officials and, further,\r\nurges the General Assembly to firmly support draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.30, designed to strengthen that\r\ninstitution and thus allow it to carry out its fundamental\r\nmission.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/54/L.30, as orally revised.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/54/L.30, as orally revised?\r\nDraft resolution A/54/L.30, as orally revised, was\r\nadopted (resolution 54/29).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 21?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.\r\n21\r\n"
