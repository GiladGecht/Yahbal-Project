(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Ingólfsson\r\n(Iceland), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 35\r\nAssistance in mine action\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/445)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that, in two letters, dated 5 and 6 October 1999\r\nrespectively, addressed to the President of the General\r\nAssembly, the Permanent Representative of Italy to the\r\nUnited Nations, in his capacity as Chairman of the Group\r\nof Western European and other States for the month of\r\nOctober, requests that the General Assembly hear\r\nstatements by the observers of the Holy See and of\r\nSwitzerland in the debate on agenda item 35.\r\nTaking into account the importance attached to the\r\nissue under discussion, it is proposed that the General\r\nAssembly take a decision on that request.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the proposal\r\nto hear the observer of the Holy See?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that there is no\r\nobjection to the proposal to hear the observer of\r\nSwitzerland?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Kahiluoto (Finland): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The Central and\r\nEastern European countries associated with the European\r\nUnion — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia — and the associated countries Cyprus and\r\nMalta, as well as the European Free Trade Association\r\n(EFTA) country member of the European Economic Area\r\n(EEA), Iceland, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThis agenda item — “Assistance in mine action” —\r\nbrings a field of tremendous humanitarian suffering before\r\nus. Almost one third of the world’s nations are, to some\r\nextent, contaminated by millions of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines and unexploded ordnance. Every 20 minutes,\r\nsomeone — in most cases a civilian — is either killed or\r\nmaimed by an anti-personnel landmine.\r\nAnti-personnel landmines have serious social and\r\neconomic consequences for the populations of mine-\r\naffected countries. Many of the countries which are most\r\nseverely affected are the least developed. The presence or\r\nperceived presence of a few anti-personnel mines has the\r\npower to disrupt entire communities.\r\nSignificant human and financial resources have been\r\ndevoted by the international community to assistance in\r\nmine action. Many encouraging developments to counter\r\nthe mine problem have taken place during the last few\r\nyears. A holistic and multidimensional approach has been\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\ndeveloped. The responsibilities of United Nations agencies\r\ninvolved in mine action have been determined. The global\r\nlandmine problem, in terms of the number of mines laid,\r\nhas been more accurately surveyed. The number of mine\r\nincidents has been reduced in many countries and the use\r\nof technology and mine-detection dogs to accelerate mine\r\nclearance programmes has become a common practice.\r\nMuch has been done, but more efficient action will be\r\nneeded.\r\nThe primary responsibility for mine action lies with\r\nthe parties responsible for laying the mines. The extent to\r\nwhich the international community should be called upon\r\nto provide assistance in mine action is dependent upon the\r\ncapacity of the local parties involved to assume these\r\nobligations themselves. In this regard, the commitment to\r\nrenounce the use of anti-personnel landmines is of\r\nparticular importance.\r\nThere have been several important developments in the\r\nfield of mine action in 1999. The European Union\r\nwelcomed the entry into force on 1 March 1999 of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction and was pleased to participate in the First\r\nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention in May 1999 in\r\nMaputo. We also welcome the entry into force on 3\r\nDecember 1998 of the amended Protocol II to the\r\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to\r\nBe Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.\r\nIn 1997, the European Union adopted a Joint Action\r\nregarding anti-personnel landmines, in which the Union\r\nreiterates its commitment to the goal of the total elimination\r\nof anti-personnel landmines worldwide; to establishing a\r\ncommon moratorium on the production and transfer of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines; and to undertaking to seek to promote\r\nin all appropriate forums, including the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, all efforts likely to contribute to the Joint\r\nAction objectives. The Union welcomed, for this reason, the\r\nopening for signature in Ottawa of the Convention and the\r\nefforts made by its signatories to promote universal\r\naccession to the Convention.\r\nThe European Union supports the central coordinating\r\nrole of the United Nations Mine Action Service in the field\r\nof humanitarian mine action within the United Nations and\r\nbeyond. We welcome the prompt establishment of the Mine\r\nAction Coordination Centre in Kosovo, under the auspices\r\nof the Mine Action Service, and encourage similar\r\napproaches, where appropriate, to other emergency\r\nsituations.\r\nThe European Union strongly supports the Ottawa\r\nConvention inter-sessional work. The five standing\r\ncommittees of experts, which will give their\r\nrecommendations to the Second Meeting of States Parties,\r\nhave an important role to play when bringing mine action\r\nto the next millennium.\r\nWe are committed to participating in international\r\nefforts to eliminate these weapons. The Union is the\r\nmajor donor in mine clearance, victim assistance and\r\nother mine-action-related activities. In 1993-1997 the\r\nUnion contributed approximately 135 million euros to\r\nmine clearance and victim assistance. In 1998, total\r\nfunding by the European Commission and member States\r\nin mine-action-related activities amounted to\r\napproximately 103 million euros. While taking due\r\naccount of humanitarian concerns, the Union will focus its\r\nfinancial and technical assistance on States parties and on\r\nsignatories which fully observe in practice the principles\r\nand objectives of the Ottawa Convention. The member\r\nStates also further mine action efforts within the\r\nframework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council,\r\nwhich has approved a new global humanitarian mine\r\naction chapter for its partnership work programme and is\r\ndeveloping concrete, practical cooperation in this field.\r\nWe confirm our commitment to work actively to promote\r\nefforts of the international community towards the\r\ncomplete elimination of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nStrong commitment from the international\r\ncommunity in the field of mine action is still needed. In\r\norder to maintain the momentum and the credibility of\r\nmine action, we have to be able to further improve mine\r\naction efforts and to put an end to the enormous\r\nhumanitarian tragedy caused by anti-personnel landmines.\r\nWe have committed ourselves to solving the problem\r\nwithin years, not decades. With this in mind, the\r\nEuropean Union is again this year sponsoring a draft\r\nresolution on assistance in mine action, which we hope\r\nwill receive broad support and will be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): The Republic of Croatia\r\nhas direct experience of the disastrous effects of mines\r\nand therefore attaches special importance to mine action\r\nassistance. My country was one of the first to actively\r\nsupport the idea of a total ban of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines; we welcomed this initiative and all subsequent\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\ncoordinated actions taken by like-minded States and\r\ninternational and non-governmental organizations.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia signed the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of Anti-personnel Mines in Ottawa on 4\r\nDecember 1997. The Government adopted the Convention\r\nin March 1998 and Parliament ratified it in April. The\r\nratification instruments were submitted to the United\r\nNations Secretariat on 20 May of the same year, making\r\nCroatia, I can proudly mention, the twelfth country to ratify\r\nthis important document.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia continues to welcome all\r\nefforts leading towards the global ban on anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. We also welcome all constructive proposals and\r\nprojects enabling the realization of a total prohibition of the\r\nuse and of the destruction of landmines, and we stand ready\r\nto cooperate with all other mine-affected countries,\r\nprimarily in the field of exchanging experiences related to\r\nmine detection and underwater demining. In that respect,\r\nthe Croatian team of experts is looking for the most\r\nfavourable solutions for achieving the safest and most cost-\r\neffective projects which would enable an efficient demining\r\nprocess.\r\nCroatia is one of the most mine-affected countries in\r\nthe world, with close to 1 million mines buried on its\r\nterritory. Ten per cent of the total surface of the Republic\r\nof Croatia is mine-contaminated. Such a high percentage of\r\nmines represents tremendous obstacles to normal\r\nfunctioning of life in these areas, particularly in\r\npredominately agricultural regions, hampering the return of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons to their homes.\r\nIf one puts aside the economic and infrastructure\r\nproblems that are very evident in the mine-affected areas,\r\nhuman safety is the factor that certainly prevails. It is\r\nprecisely the humanitarian nature of the Ottawa movement\r\nthat has most contributed to the creation of political will\r\nand readiness to support this praiseworthy initiative. The\r\neffectiveness of anti-personnel mines in military conflicts,\r\noften used as an argument by those still unwilling to sign\r\nthe Ottawa Convention, indeed has proven to be a\r\nsuperfluous element in modern warfare, according to many\r\nmilitary analysts and experts. Therefore, as I am sure you\r\nall agree, civilian casualties in the aftermath of military\r\nconflicts are the only result of the usage of these, I dare\r\nsay, monstrous devices designed to kill mostly civilians.\r\nWhile speaking of casualties, I must mention that during\r\nthe past few years, 560 victims of landmines were\r\nregistered in the Republic of Croatia, 120 of whom were\r\nkilled.\r\nIn order to fight the problem, the demining process\r\nin Croatia is proceeding well and is being carried out in\r\naccordance with the highest international standards. The\r\nUnited Nations established the Mine Action Centre in\r\nCroatia in 1996, which merged with the Croatian Mine\r\nAction Centre established in 1998. The mine clearance\r\nprocess is not only frightfully dangerous and time\r\nconsuming, but it is also a very expensive activity. The\r\ncost of mine clearing and other demining-related activities\r\nin the Republic of Croatia has, in the past few years,\r\namounted to nearly $150 million. The Government of\r\nCroatia has borne 90 per cent of those costs, while 10 per\r\ncent has been covered from a donation fund. We are\r\nlooking forward to the realization of next year’s estimated\r\nrise in foreign donations to 20 per cent of the total\r\namount required. We are very thankful to all countries,\r\nparticulary Switzerland, Norway, Germany, Canada, the\r\nUnited States, Japan, Sweden, Belgium, the United\r\nKingdom and Italy; international organizations, such as\r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, the World\r\nBank and the United Nations Mine Action Service;\r\nregional organizations, such as the European Union and\r\nthe West European Union; and non-governmental\r\norganizations such as the Slovenian International Trust\r\nFund, for their valuable contributions.\r\nExperts have estimated that 10 more years of mine\r\nclearance are needed to be able to say that most of the\r\nwork has been done. At this moment we have 800 well-\r\ntrained and highly skilled experts working in the field.\r\nSome of them have been asked to help in the efforts of\r\nthe international community to clear as many mines as\r\npossible in the most sensitive locations before winter\r\narrives in Kosovo, and they have responded very quickly.\r\nCurrently, the Croatian Mine Assistance Centre, together\r\nwith the Slovenian International Trust Fund, supported by\r\nthe United States Government, is working on establishing\r\na regional centre for training mine experts and for testing\r\nnew technologies.\r\nCroatia looks to the follow-up of the Ottawa process\r\nas a catalyst for genuinely advancing mine action\r\nthroughout the world. Based on our own experience, we\r\nfirmly believe that more forceful action is required at\r\nnational, regional and global levels.\r\nAs an indicator of our continuous efforts concerning\r\nthe Ottawa Convention, allow me to inform you of the\r\nRegional Mine Action Conference which took place in\r\nZagreb in June this year and which was a follow-up to\r\nthe first Regional Conference on Landmines, held in\r\nBudapest in March 1998. The Conference provided a\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nforum for a broad exchange of views on recent international\r\nand regional mine action developments. The Conference\r\nalso gave us an opportunity to assess the ongoing\r\nprogrammes in demining and mine-victim assistance and\r\nrehabilitation, and it gave political impetus to increasing\r\nregional and international cooperation and coordination to\r\nmeet this challenge. The participation of His Excellency\r\nCornelio Sommaruga, President of the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross, was highly appreciated by all\r\nparticipants.\r\nCroatia will work hard with all interested countries to\r\nsupport the Ottawa Convention in its next phase. The\r\nresolution now under consideration on assistance in mine\r\naction should provide a useful input to our deliberations on\r\nthe preparatory process. The United Nations role in\r\nincreasing international mine-related activities and\r\ncooperation remains indisputable, and we look forward to\r\nits continuing contribution.\r\nFinally, mine action is indeed about people. It is about\r\nenabling all of us to live in an environment free from\r\nphysical, socio-economic and psychological entrapments\r\ncaused by these callous and indiscriminate killers. Let us\r\nmake these worthwhile efforts a reality for all.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): This year has been marked by\r\nseveral events adding to the remarkable history of the battle\r\nagainst the scourge of anti-personnel landmines. The\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of Mines entered into force\r\non 1 March. With the successful outcome of the First\r\nMeeting of the States Parties in May, the Maputo\r\nDeclaration and the adoption of an inter-sessional work\r\nplan, the Convention was established as the primary\r\nframework for strategic efforts in resolving the serious\r\nhumanitarian problems caused by anti-personnel landmines.\r\nThe true value of the Convention, however, rests on its\r\nsustained realization of tangible results in the field. Mine\r\naction efforts will not be viable unless we are assured that\r\nno new anti-personnel landmines will be emplaced. We\r\nurge all those States that have not yet signed and ratified\r\nthe Convention to do so.\r\nNorway welcomes the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nassistance in mine action presented to the General\r\nAssembly, giving an overview of the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations system and its interaction with other\r\npartners. We appreciate the efforts on the part of the United\r\nNations system in moving from policy formulation to policy\r\nimplementation. We fully share the approach whereby mine\r\naction from an early stage constitutes an integral part of the\r\nOrganization’s broader response to humanitarian crises,\r\nreconstruction and development efforts in situations\r\ninvolving the aftermath of conflict.\r\nMine action cannot be perceived as a mere technical\r\noperation. We need to better understand the socio-\r\neconomic and development implications of the scourge of\r\nlandmines and the benefits of mine action. At the same\r\ntime, we must not lose sight of the true essence of\r\nprogress in the field — that is, to remove landmines from\r\nthe ground and minimize the risk for people living with\r\nthe constant threat and terror created by the presence of\r\nthese weapons.\r\nThe United Nations plays a central role in global\r\nmine action. We appreciate the role that the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service is playing as the focal point\r\nfor mine action within the United Nations system. We\r\nhave contributed to the Voluntary Trust Fund for\r\nAssistance in Mine Action in support of the activities of\r\nthe United Nations Mine Action Service, and we will\r\ncontinue to do so in a flexible manner. The United\r\nNations portfolio on mine action programmes is a tool\r\nthat hopefully will also be used more actively by\r\nGovernments as a basis for funding.\r\nThe broad-based United Nations assessment missions\r\nare important in the planning of future programmes. In\r\nthis regard, we would stress that it is important for mine-\r\naffected countries to give access to the United Nations\r\nteams. We also appreciate the contribution by the\r\ndifferent United Nations agencies in the development of\r\nan integrated approach to dealing effectively with the\r\ncomplexity of the landmine problems.\r\nThe revision of international standards for\r\nhumanitarian mine clearance and the development of\r\ninternational test procedures and guidelines for the use of\r\nmine detection dogs and mechanical mine clearance\r\nequipment are also greatly appreciated. They will make\r\nmine action programmes more effective and reduce\r\naccident rates and incidents of incomplete clearance. In\r\norder to improve international standards, procedures and\r\nguidelines, it is necessary to include the experience and\r\nconsiderations of mine-affected countries, interested States\r\nand the operators in the field.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the project initiated by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme on identifying\r\nsocio-economic indicators for mine action programmes. A\r\nclearer picture of the impact of the presence of landmines\r\non people and societies will facilitate improved prioritization.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nStates, international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations form a powerful network with\r\nthe potential to tackle the various aspects of mine action.\r\nThe inter-sessional work within the framework of the Mine\r\nBan Convention with the standing committees of experts\r\nconstitute an arena for mine action open for all actors to\r\ncontribute to the goal of the Convention: a world free of\r\nanti-personnel landmines. We look forward to the active\r\nparticipation of the United Nations Mine Action Service\r\nand the relevant United Nations agencies in this endeavour.\r\nPredictable and stable funding is necessary to carry out\r\nmine action programmes effectively. Norway has made a\r\ncommitment of $120 million dollars over a five-year period.\r\nDuring 1998 and 1999, more than $45 million dollars have\r\nbeen channelled directly to mine action projects. I would\r\nlike to highlight a few points which Norway regards as\r\nparticularly relevant with regard to the implementation of\r\nmine action programmes.\r\nFirst, there is a need to make better use of\r\ncoordination mechanisms at the country level, preferably\r\nheaded by national authorities. These groups should include\r\ndonors, international organizations and national and\r\ninternational non-governmental organizations, and they\r\nshould work closely with mine action coordination centres\r\nin order to ensure effective coordination, prioritization and\r\nplanning.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations Mine Action\r\nCoordination Centre in Kosovo demonstrates one example\r\nof effective implementation and coordination. The Kosovo\r\nmodel has managed to encompass all major mine action\r\nactors in one homogeneous structure. This approach should\r\nbe shared with other mine action programmes, though we\r\nneed to bear in mind that each situation is different and\r\nrequires its own specific solution.\r\nThirdly, the early introduction of the Information\r\nManagement System for Mine Action in Kosovo has been\r\na great asset to the operation. For the first time, all actors\r\ninvolved in mine action, both military and civilian, are able\r\nto communicate on the same information platform. We\r\nencourage the United Nations to further introduce this\r\nmanagement tool in existing programmes.\r\nFinally, assistance to mine victims is a central part of\r\nmine action activities. Existing structures within the health\r\nand social sectors should be reinforced and services and\r\nprogrammes intended for mine victims should include all\r\npersons with disabilities, regardless of the cause.\r\nInternational organizations, donors and affected States\r\nshould examine further ways of enhancing assistance to\r\nmine victims, including socio-economic reintegration. We\r\nhope these issues, as well as other thematic questions\r\nsuch as the socio-economic impact of landmines, can be\r\naddressed in the report of the Secretary- General next\r\nyear.\r\nWe look forward to continuing our close\r\ncollaboration with the United Nations system and mine-\r\naffected countries, as well as other interested States and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, in meeting the challenges\r\nahead.\r\nMr. Ortique (United States of America): Near the\r\nstart of this century, just 10 per cent of war-time\r\ncasualties were civilians. More recently, the figure has\r\ngrown to 90 per cent. This stunning reversal is not due\r\nentirely to landmines, but landmines do tell us a great\r\ndeal about the brutal and indiscriminate nature of conflict\r\nin our time. Notwithstanding removal efforts, an estimated\r\n70 million landmines still scar the surface of our world.\r\nThese weapons are a terrible humanitarian problem,\r\nbut they also slow political development and retard\r\neconomic progress. They keep refugees from going home\r\nand the displaced from their land long after the guns of\r\nwar fall silent. They are cheap to buy, easy to use, hard\r\nto detect and difficult to remove. They do the most harm\r\nto societies that can least afford to clear mines, to caution\r\ntheir civilians, to care for victims or to cope with the loss\r\nof their agricultural land. Above all, they endanger those\r\nwho endanger no one by creating fear in the innocent and\r\nthe young, far too frequently crippling them or too often\r\ntaking their very lives.\r\nRealistically, President Clinton and Vice-President\r\nGore have made it a goal of the United States to help end\r\nthe threat posed by landmines to civilians of every part of\r\nevery region of every continent around the world before\r\nthe turn of the next decade. Since 1993 the United States\r\nhas provided more than $350 million to this effort, four\r\ntimes that of any other country. Today we are helping\r\nsome 30 countries to map and clear their most dangerous\r\nminefields, to train local deminers and to teach children\r\nand adults how to identify and avoid mines. We are\r\nworking with groups such as the Vietnam Veterans of\r\nAmerica Foundation, the Landmine Survivors Network\r\nand the Patrick Leahy War Victims Fund to assist and to\r\ncounsel landmine survivors in more than a dozen\r\ncountries.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nWe are using the best scientific talents presently\r\navailable to improve mine detection and clearance\r\ntechniques. But, regrettably, as the twenty-first century is\r\nabout to dawn, the technology most commonly used to find\r\nmines around the world is still a stick attached to a human\r\narm. Mankind, which relentlessly pursues pathways to the\r\nother planets and beyond, can and must do better than this.\r\nThat is why my country is creating testing centres and\r\nfunding research at 14 universities around the country. And\r\nthat is why the National Aeronautics and Space\r\nAdministration has a project to apply the same techniques\r\nused in trying to detect life on Mars to the task of finding\r\nlandmines, thereby protecting life on Earth.\r\nEliminating the landmine threat to civilians by the end\r\nof the coming decade is a daunting challenge, but I am\r\nconvinced that it is attainable. There have been real success\r\nstories along the way to encourage us. In Cambodia, for\r\nexample, the landmine accident rate has been reduced by 90\r\nper cent — the difference between health and injury or\r\ndeath for more than 5,000 Cambodians this year alone. In\r\nAfghanistan hundreds of thousands of acres previously lost\r\nto mines are now supporting productive crops. In\r\nMozambique refugees have returned home on 4,000 miles\r\nof roads that have been cleared of their mines. Great strides\r\nhave also been made in Central Europe and Central\r\nAmerica. Governments alone did not make this progress.\r\nBut the only way to reach our larger goal is for countries,\r\nnon-governmental groups and people all over the world to\r\nwork together.\r\nIn the United States the private sector and voluntary\r\norganizations have responded to the landmine crisis with\r\ngenerosity, creativity and heart. The United Nations\r\nAssociation of the United States of America is sponsoring\r\nthe Adopt-A-Minefield Campaign. Already 40 groups\r\naround the country have raised more than $2 million to\r\nclear a path to a safer world.\r\nI would respectfully suggest that it is frequently\r\nappropriate to seek simple pursuits and engage less\r\nsophisticated educational tools that are significantly\r\nsuccessful in saving lives. For example, DC Comics and the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund are producing comic books\r\nfor Bosnia, Central America and Kosovo in which\r\nSuperman and Wonderwoman teach kids and their parents\r\nhow to spot and stay away from landmines. The Marshall\r\nLegacy Institute has launched a canine corps, a programme\r\nto use dogs to sniff out mines around the world. The\r\nHumane Society is also involved, because they recognize\r\nthat mines kill hundreds of thousands of animals every\r\nyear.\r\nThese are simplistic efforts, but effective. Simplistic,\r\nbut successful. Thus the United States is the world’s\r\nleader in civilian humanitarian demining, but, as I have\r\nemphasized, this is not and cannot be a solo proposition.\r\nWe can succeed only by continuing to collaborate with\r\nmine-affected countries, with the United Nations, with\r\nprivate groups and with foreign donors.\r\nEvery day, mine by mine, acre by acre, people\r\nacross our globe are reclaiming their lands and moving\r\ncloser, with every safe and silent step, to a life filled with\r\nhope and free from fear. By working to eliminate this\r\nscourge in the lives of the innocent, we secure our future,\r\nbut we also secure their future in the breast of a tranquil\r\npeace for all of the world.\r\nWith persistence, determination and generosity, all\r\nof us must continue to progress, because, as we look to\r\nthe new century, there could be no more appropriate a\r\ngoal than enabling every child everywhere to walk our\r\nearth in the rapture of peace, justice and safety. With this\r\nI challenge my fellow representatives, and I thank you,\r\nMr. President, for giving me the opportunity to do so.\r\nMr. Jayanama (Thailand): On behalf of the Thai\r\ndelegation, I would like to express my appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on “Assistance in mine\r\naction” dated 6 October 1999. The report’s review of\r\ncoordinated mine action, the activities of agencies within\r\nthe United Nations system and non-governmental\r\norganizations, and the various country programmes\r\nprovides a comprehensive picture of, and useful\r\ninformation on, the current state of play on this important\r\nissue. More significantly, it highlights once again the\r\ncontinuing dangerous threat posed by landmines and\r\nunexploded ordnance to all people, regardless of gender,\r\nrace or age.\r\nLandmines not only kill and maim indiscriminately,\r\nclaiming the lives of innocent civilians, including women\r\nand children, but they also hamper socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, divert scarce resources from more\r\nproductive activities and instil constant fear and insecurity\r\namong the local population. Landmines are cheap to\r\nproduce and easily deployed, but the costs of their\r\nremoval are a hundred times higher, not to mention the\r\nincalculable human toll, which could not be valued in\r\nterms of dollars and cents. Landmines undoubtedly pose\r\na pre-eminent threat to human security.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nAlthough Thailand neither produces nor exports\r\nlandmines, it knows only too well their devastating\r\nconsequences on people’s lives and welfare through\r\nfirsthand experience of the spillover effects of armed\r\nconflicts in neighbouring countries over the past 30 years.\r\nAbout 796 square kilometres of our border areas are\r\ninfested with anti-personnel landmines and unexploded\r\nordnance. Countless Thai children, as well as those of\r\ndisplaced persons, have lost their lives or become amputees.\r\nEven more have been orphaned.\r\nFor these reasons, Thailand strongly supports the goal\r\nof “zero victims” and all international efforts to resolve the\r\nlandmine threat once and for all. These should include not\r\nonly mine clearance but also mine-awareness development,\r\nmine-victim assistance and the rehabilitation of mined\r\nareas.\r\nThe process engendered by the signing and coming\r\ninto force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction, known as the Ottawa\r\nConvention, is one that Thailand fully embraces. In our\r\nview, this process should be further reinforced through\r\nconcrete steps taken both on the ground and in international\r\nforums. In this context, we welcome the renewed\r\ncommitment to the total eradication of landmines contained\r\nin the Maputo Declaration of the inaugural Meeting of the\r\nStates Parties to the 1999 Ottawa Convention, as well as\r\nthe inter-sessional work programme. We hope that the\r\ninformal standing committees of experts established in\r\nMaputo will add impetus to international cooperation and\r\nto the momentum of assistance in this area, so that closer\r\ncoordination of efforts with all concerned parties at the\r\ninternational, regional and subregional levels would be\r\neffected.\r\nThe need for effective coordination cannot be\r\noveremphasized. In this connection, we welcome the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations Mine Action Service\r\n(UNMAS) and commend its efforts in coordinating mine\r\naction activities among different United Nations agencies\r\nand other organizations.\r\nFor its part, Thailand has undertaken numerous efforts\r\ntowards the elimination of the threat of landmines. We\r\nratified the Ottawa Convention on 27 November last year.\r\nOn 1 May 1999, the day the Ottawa Convention entered\r\ninto force for Thailand, we destroyed 10,000 anti-personnel\r\nlandmines in stock, thus becoming the first developing\r\ncountry to destroy mines as stipulated in the Convention.\r\nTo rationalize mine action efforts at the national\r\nlevel, the Thailand Mine Action Centre (TMAC) was\r\nestablished in December last year as the focal point for\r\nmine action in the country. The Centre is responsible for\r\ndrafting the national strategic plan on mine action, which\r\nincludes information dissemination on mine action\r\nactivities, demining, destroying mines in stockpile,\r\nconducting training and providing assistance to mine\r\nvictims. The Centre also works closely with both\r\ninternational and Thai non-governmental organizations,\r\nincluding the Thailand Campaign to Ban Landmines,\r\nwhich is affiliated with the International Campaign to Ban\r\nLandmines, the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nSome of the specific activities being planned by the\r\nCentre include the following: conducting a level 1 survey\r\nin order to help establish a national database on the mine\r\nsituation and its impact, pending approval by the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service; fencing and marking mined\r\nareas in accordance with article 7 of the Ottawa\r\nConvention, which deals with transparency measures; and\r\ndeveloping a “training of trainers” programme for\r\ndemining.\r\nThe successful completion of these projects,\r\nhowever, requires assistance from the international\r\ncommunity. We thus call on the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Service to provide the necessary funds for the\r\nlevel 1 study project. We believe international assistance\r\nto mine-affected countries, which are mostly developing\r\ncountries, whether for mine clearance or humanitarian\r\nassistance both to victims and survivors of landmines, is\r\na vital element of cooperation in mine action. The\r\nvoluntary trust fund for assistance in mine action is thus\r\na necessity.\r\nThailand also supports cooperation in mine action at\r\nthe regional level. Such cooperation has taken place along\r\nthe Thai-Cambodian border, the area of the largest\r\nconcentration of landmines in Thailand. The Thai\r\nGovernment’s past contributions to mine clearance efforts\r\nin Cambodia, made in collaboration with the United\r\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia in 1992 and\r\n1993, are well known. More recently, in February this\r\nyear, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to take all the\r\nnecessary steps to make their common borders free from\r\nall landmines within three years and to establish joint\r\nprojects on mine clearance and other related activities.\r\nThis initiative is an exemplary stepping stone for\r\nenhanced cooperation among countries in the region to\r\neliminate the common threat of landmines. We hope that\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nsuch humanitarian cooperation with other neighbours will\r\nalso be possible in the near future.\r\nWe in the international community are committed to\r\nachieving peace, security and prosperity for all people in\r\nthe next millennium, and the total elimination of landmines\r\nis certainly one of our foremost tasks. Although the harm\r\nand suffering brought about by this indiscriminate weapon\r\nof terror cannot be undone overnight, we hope that, in our\r\nenlightenment, we can make up for our past errors.\r\nThrough strong commitment and joint action, we can help\r\nremove the threat that landmines pose, as well as alleviate\r\nthe suffering they have caused to more than a few\r\ngenerations of mankind.\r\nMs. Molaroni (San Marino): The Republic of San\r\nMarino was among the first countries to ratify the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction, because it realized its importance and its\r\ngreat implications for human lives. We are extremely\r\nsatisfied to see that it has finally entered into force, and we\r\nhope that more and more countries will not only become\r\nparties to it but will start to implement its articles as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nAt the First Meeting of the States Parties to the\r\nOttawa Convention, held in Maputo, the States parties\r\nwisely decided on an inter-sessional programme of work\r\nand established five informal standing committees of\r\nexperts on mine clearance; victim assistance, socio-\r\neconomic reintegration and mine awareness; technologies\r\nfor mine action; stockpile destruction; and general status\r\nand operation of the Convention.\r\nTo date, 136 countries have signed the Ottawa\r\nConvention and 88 have ratified it. The Convention requires\r\nthat States parties destroy stockpiled anti-personnel mines\r\nwithin four years of ratification and eliminate the mines\r\nalready in the ground within 10 years. Unfortunately, the\r\nprocess of demining takes much longer in many cases, due\r\nto the lack of adequate funding, infrastructures,\r\nprogrammes, coordination and expertise. Worse still, it is\r\ndue in many instances to the excessive bureaucracy and the\r\nneed to protect economic interests.\r\nEighty-seven countries and eight other areas in the\r\nworld are affected by both landmines and unexploded\r\nordnance; 27 of the countries affected are States parties to\r\nthe Convention, 23 are signatories and 37 have not yet\r\njoined it. In Africa, of 48 countries, 26 are affected by\r\nlandmines, and in America, 9 out of 35 countries have\r\nthem. In Asia, 16 out of 39 countries have landmines; in\r\nEurope and Central Asia, 23 countries have them; and in\r\nthe Middle East and North Africa, 13 out of 18 countries\r\nare affected by this plague.\r\nAll of this data may give the impression that the\r\nworld has precise information about the nature of this\r\nproblem, but that is not the case. The lack of proper and\r\naccurate information about the dissemination of landmines\r\nis substantial. Many projects are being carried out at this\r\nvery moment to ascertain the dimensions of landmine\r\ninfestation in particular countries, but even so the data is\r\nfragmented and incomplete. In Africa, the worst affected\r\narea of the globe, only one third of the affected countries\r\nhave undergone some kind of survey on the landmine\r\nsituation. The Republic of San Marino is deeply\r\nconvinced that mine awareness is a cornerstone of mine\r\naction and that information and education are the main\r\ntools to reduce the landmine threat.\r\nHumanitarian mine clearance is a relatively new\r\ndiscipline. It involves the technical issues of detecting and\r\ndestroying various mines and ammunition, and the\r\nmanagerial, developmental, social and financial aspects of\r\nimplementing large programmes in a broad variety of\r\nscenarios. Up until now, most humanitarian programmes\r\nhave been funded in a fragmented manner, on a short-\r\nterm basis and with short planning horizons. Even so, in\r\nthe majority of countries, the capacities and the\r\nprogrammes exist to implement mine clearance, although\r\nthey are not always exploited in the best way. Too many\r\ncountries still ignore the situation and non-governmental\r\norganizations are left alone to work towards that goal. In\r\nother countries, programmes are operated by military\r\nunits or commercial entrepreneurs, and there is no actual\r\nassurance of a long-lasting results. In fact, if Governments\r\ndo not commit themselves to respecting international\r\nstandards, we can have very low expectations about the\r\ntotal elimination of this scourge.\r\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\r\ncommend the work of the United Nations Mine Action\r\nService, among all other international and national\r\ninstitutions, and its staff, who have succeeded in\r\nachieving great results, notwithstanding the scarce\r\nfunding. The Mine Action Service adopted an inter-\r\nagency approach, identifying local conditions and\r\nconcerns and making it possible to tailor mine action\r\nassistance to fit individual countries’ needs. For this\r\nreason, San Marino has decided to make a voluntary\r\ncontribution to its projects. This contribution underlines\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nthe active commitment of my country and is given in\r\nrecognition of all the efforts of the Mine Action Service.\r\nMine awareness efforts represent an important part of\r\nthe programmes to reduce human risk. Educational\r\nmechanisms focusing on changing risk behaviours and\r\ncreating awareness of safety measures are a necessity if we\r\nwant to reduce the number of landmine victims during the\r\nprocess of demining, which in many cases can last years.\r\nFor a considerable time, San Marino has been making\r\nits contribution, on an understandably small scale, to\r\nprojects to improve social awareness of arms and landmines\r\nin various affected areas of the globe. For next year, my\r\nGovernment has already allocated some voluntary funds to\r\nfinance projects in these areas, and we hope that more and\r\nmore countries will soon join us. However, landmines and\r\nunexploded ordnance awareness programmes exist in only\r\n40 of the 87 affected countries. That is definitely not\r\nenough.\r\nA further aspect of the question is the survey process,\r\nwhich makes it possible to identify and to map problem\r\nareas and allocate resources according to the density of\r\nlandmines and the higher risk factors. San Marino believes\r\nthat priority should be given to densely populated areas of\r\nthe globe, that people should come first and that we should\r\ndirect our action to alleviating the suffering of those\r\npopulations that risk their lives every day.\r\nFor all of those reasons, we will always support this\r\nitem in the General Assembly and in the First Committee\r\nuntil landmines become a distant memory. That will be one\r\nof the greatest victories of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic Republic):\r\nAt the outset, my delegation would like to convey its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nand informative report on assistance in mine action,\r\ncontained in document A/54/445. The report presents a\r\nuseful overview of mine action currently undertaken by\r\nUnited Nations programmes and other related agencies.\r\nThe question of mines and other unexploded ordnance\r\nresulting from protracted wars, regional conflicts and\r\ninternal struggles continues to be a matter of special\r\nconcern for the international community. Though national\r\nand local approaches to the problem of mine clearance have\r\nexisted for decades, millions of landmines and other\r\nunexploded ordnance are still buried in the soil or scattered\r\non the surface in over 60 countries around the world, and\r\nthousands of innocent people are being killed or injured\r\nevery day. While causing great suffering and death to\r\ninnocent people, these hidden killers also create\r\ntremendous obstacles to the development of the economic\r\nand social infrastructure of the affected nations. Every\r\neffort should therefore be made to intensify international\r\ncooperation in mine actions. My delegation firmly\r\nbelieves that only through such a collective effort can\r\nhuman beings live safe from these killers.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic is today\r\nseriously affected by unexploded ordnance as a result of\r\nthe heaviest aerial bombardment during the Indo-China\r\nwar, especially between 1964 and 1973. During this\r\nperiod, over 500,000 bombing missions were launched,\r\ndropping more than two million tons of bombs on this\r\nsmall country of 4.5 million inhabitants. Most of the\r\nbombing consisted of anti-personnel cluster bombs filled\r\nwith 670 bomblets or “bombies”, as they are known in\r\nLaos, that were intended to explode on or shortly after\r\nimpact. Whereas the manufacturers of this ordnance\r\nestimated a failure rate of as low as 10 per cent, it is now\r\ngenerally agreed that the actual failure rate may have\r\nbeen as high as 30 per cent. Extensive ground battles in\r\nseveral provinces also left staggering amounts of\r\nunexploded ordnance, including mortar and artillery\r\nshells, mines, sub-munitions and other devices of various\r\norigins, which gives the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic the distinction of being one of the most heavily\r\nordnance-contaminated nations in the world.\r\nTwenty-five years after the end of the war,\r\nunexploded ordnance contamination still affects up to 50\r\nper cent of the landmass of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic. Bomblets can be found everywhere, in villages\r\nand towns, along roads, on hillsides, in gardens and rice\r\nfields. They do not choose, but rather strike all their\r\nvictims equally, including children, women and\r\nsubsistence farmers.\r\nThe Lao Government has drawn up a comprehensive\r\nprogramme to address this problem in all its\r\nhumanitarian, social and environmental dimensions.\r\nWithin a framework of integrating our efforts, the Lao\r\nNational Unexploded Ordnance Programme, known as\r\nUXO Lao, has been set up with the objectives of reducing\r\nthe number of civilian casualties from unexploded\r\nordnance and increasing the amount of land available for\r\nfood production and other development activities.\r\nUXO Lao activities are divided into four important\r\ncomponents, including Community Awareness, Training\r\nand Capacity Building, Survey, and Clearance. The\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nprogramme is now fully operational in 9 of 15 unexploded\r\nordnance-contaminated provinces and has a national staff of\r\n880 supported by 32 international advisors.\r\nAccording to the 1998 annual report, 269 students\r\ngraduated from the National Training Centre and have\r\njoined those now serving in the field; and 67,875 items of\r\nordnance were destroyed across the country, exceeding the\r\ntarget of 45,000 items. Equally important, over 292 hectares\r\nof agriculture land and land for development were cleared\r\nof unexploded ordnance. This far exceeded the yearly\r\ntarget, which had been set at 200 hectares. With regard to\r\ncommunity awareness activities, some 556 villages were\r\nvisited and over 161,000 people were briefed on the\r\ndangers of unexploded ordnance; roving teams also visited\r\n1,392 villages in response to emergency requests.\r\nDespite the progress made, unfortunately, there were\r\nstill 89 accidents related to unexploded ordnance reported\r\nduring 1998; in those, 59 people were seriously injured and\r\n30 people were killed. In the first months of 1999, the\r\naccident rate and number of injuries were higher than\r\nduring the same period of 1998. This increase reflects,\r\namong other things, improved reporting mechanisms and\r\ngrowing pressure for access to new land.\r\nThe UXO Lao Trust Fund, supported by the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), continues to be the\r\nmain channel for contributions to the work of UXO Lao.\r\nOver the past three years, funding has been provided by\r\nUNDP, UNICEF, the European Union and the Governments\r\nof Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Finland,\r\nFrance, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New\r\nZealand, Norway, Sweden, the United States and the United\r\nKingdom. The programme is also supported by some\r\ninternational implementing partners such as Handicap\r\nInternational, the Mine Advisory Group and Norwegian\r\nPeople’s Aid, among others. In this regard, my delegation\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to express its sincere\r\nappreciation to all donors for the generous assistance and\r\nsupport which have rendered the UXO Lao Trust Fund\r\nactivities possible.\r\nThe approximate overall mobilization target for the\r\nyear 2000 is over 13 million dollars, to be received either\r\nas cash or in-kind contributions. The fund available\r\nnevertheless is little more than $4 million. We are therefore\r\nquite concerned about this reduction in contributions. Due\r\nto shortfalls in donor support, the status of the programme\r\nremains uncertain and the current level of operations will\r\nnot be sustainable in the future. Therefore, together with\r\nUNDP and UNICEF, we will continue to try hard to\r\nsecure the necessary funding for programme operations\r\nfor the year 2000 and beyond. In this connection, it is our\r\nfervent hope that the international community will\r\ncontinue to lend its support and assistance to our arduous\r\nefforts to achieve the objectives set out in the programme.\r\nAs we stand at the threshold of the new century, let\r\nus rededicate ourselves to demining activities so as to\r\ngive peoples the opportunity to live in an environment\r\nfree from the physical, socio-economic and psychological\r\ntraps these killers create and to ensure that those now\r\nliving with the threat of landmines will have the chance\r\nto enjoy a peaceful and productive existence. We believe\r\nthat only through concerted global efforts and\r\ncooperation, with the United Nations as a focal point for\r\nmine action, will we be able to accomplish the huge tasks\r\nthat lie ahead.\r\nMr. Livermore (Canada): The report of the\r\nSecretary-General on mine action highlights both the\r\nchallenges that lie before the international community and\r\nthe strategies required to address this issue in a\r\ncomprehensive fashion. Canada wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for providing such\r\na comprehensive and timely report.\r\nI was forcefully struck by the magnitude and\r\nseriousness of the landmine problem when I visited the\r\nmost mine-affected State in the Americas —\r\nNicaragua — earlier this month. I talked to people who\r\nlive in fear of the very ground on which they walk. I met\r\nwith survivors of landmine incidents. I saw tracts of land\r\nrendered unusable because of the suspected presence of\r\nmines. The scenes I witnessed in Nicaragua are repeated\r\nall too often in post-conflict situations throughout the\r\nworld. In Croatia, Cambodia, Mozambique, Yemen and\r\ndozens of other States, citizens and societies must contend\r\nwith the deadly legacy of landmines in their attempts to\r\nrebuild lives and communities long after conflicts have\r\nended.\r\nYet, in addition to witnessing the devastating impact\r\nof mines, while in Nicaragua I also saw the hope that\r\nflows from international efforts to address the impact of\r\nlandmines. Through the cooperation of civil society, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the military and the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), hundreds of\r\nthousands of square metres of land have been cleared in\r\nNicaragua and a work programme has been established to\r\ncomplete the task.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThrough the OAS, the United Nations, other\r\ninternational governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations, and other institutional arrangements, Canada\r\nhas committed more than $1 million to support mine-action\r\nactivities in Nicaragua.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOur commitment to mine clearance is multifaceted. In\r\nSouth America, Canada is supporting mine clearance along\r\nthe Peru-Ecuador border. In the Middle East, Canada has\r\nprovided equipment and training to Jordan’s demining\r\nprogramme. In Europe, Canada has made major\r\ncommitments to mine clearance in Croatia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and Kosovo. In Africa, Canada has made a\r\nmultimillion-dollar investment in Mozambique’s mine-\r\naction programme. And in Asia, Canada is continuing its\r\nlong-standing commitment to assist Cambodia with its\r\ndevastating mine problem.\r\nSince the signing of the Ottawa Convention in\r\nDecember 1997, Canada has disbursed more than Can$10\r\nmillion in support of mine-clearance operations. The role of\r\nthe United Nations — of the United Nations Mine Action\r\nService (UNMAS) and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme — in mobilizing donor support and organizing\r\nprogrammes in mine-affected countries has been truly\r\nimpressive.\r\nClearing mined land is, of course, only one aspect of\r\nmine action. Governments, along with international and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, must take action to prevent\r\nnew mine casualties and to provide assistance to survivors\r\nof mine incidents. Canada applauds the leadership of the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund in providing mine-\r\nawareness education to populations at risk, as well as in\r\ndeveloping international guidelines for raising public\r\nawareness about landmines and unexploded ordnance.\r\nCanada has supported mine-awareness programmes in\r\nAfghanistan, Angola, Iraq, Laos and Yemen.\r\nWe also recognize that the international community as\r\na whole has an obligation to meet the needs of survivors of\r\nlandmine incidents. Canada’s commitment to victim\r\nassistance is a global one, including support to programmes\r\nin Cambodia, Afghanistan and Uganda, as well as a\r\nmultimilliondollar commitment to the Pan American Health\r\nOrganization’s victim-assistance programme in Central\r\nAmerica.\r\nThe essence of successfully addressing the landmine\r\nproblem is developing comprehensive, workable strategies\r\nto meet each situation. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that at the heart of mine action are assessment\r\nmissions, comprehensive national surveys and other mine-\r\nrelated information activities, effective coordination and\r\ninformation management, and research into and\r\ndevelopment of mine-related technologies. As a lead\r\nproponent of national level 1 surveys, we have made\r\nmultimillion-dollar commitments to surveys in Yemen and\r\nMozambique.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn addition, Canada is committed to increasing the\r\nquantity and quality of other information that will\r\nstrengthen mine-action efforts. We are supporting the\r\npilot testing of victim-assistance information tools in\r\nAfghanistan and a project in eastern Africa.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWith respect to coordination, Canada emphasizes the\r\nimportant coordination and priority-setting role of the\r\nUnited Nations Mine Action Service. Over the past two\r\nyears Canada has helped to fund some of the core\r\nactivities of UNMAS. This year we provided it with a\r\ndatabase that will enable mine-action donors to\r\ncommunicate about their mine-action efforts.\r\nAdvocacy remains an exceptionally important\r\ncomponent of mine action. Through measures like\r\nadvocacy in support of the comprehensive ban on anti-\r\npersonnel mines, we can help to ensure that the landmine\r\nproblem does not worsen. We applaud the work of\r\nliterally hundreds of non-governmental organizations,\r\nmany under the auspices of the International Campaign to\r\nBan Land Mines, which are the very heart and soul of\r\ninternational advocacy and which have continued to work\r\nto make the landmine ban treaty as universal as possible.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nOne of the most important ways to prevent the\r\nexacerbation of the landmine problem is to destroy mine\r\nstocks. Canada commends those States that have partially\r\nor completely destroyed their mine stocks, and we call on\r\nall signatories to the Ottawa Convention to finalize a\r\ntimetable for the destruction of their stocks. Canada is\r\nworking in partnership with Ukraine to assist in the\r\ndestruction of its anti-personnel mines, and we urge other\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nStates which have the means to do so to provide similar\r\nassistance wherever it may be needed.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIf we are to eradicate the devastating impact of\r\nlandmines, we must continue to support the full spectrum\r\nof activities which form part of mine action. For the 89\r\nStates parties to the Ottawa Convention, providing\r\nassistance to international mine-related activities is an\r\nobligation. Canada also values the contributions of other\r\nStates which have yet to ratify the Convention. While we\r\nwelcome the statements of several States which have\r\nforsworn the production, stockpiling, use or transfer of anti-\r\npersonnel mines, we should be clear that our ultimate goal\r\nis the universal acceptance of the total ban on anti-\r\npersonnel mines through adherence to the landmine ban\r\nConvention. Until we attain this goal, the human security of\r\nindividuals throughout the world in this area cannot be\r\nguaranteed. We should therefore make it our collective goal\r\nto increase the numbers of ratifications, attaining at least\r\n100 prior to 1 March, 2000, the first anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the Convention.\r\nHand in hand with the issue of ratification is the full\r\nand effective implementation of the Convention. We\r\ncongratulate the Government of Mozambique on hosting the\r\nhighly successful First Meeting of States Parties in Maputo\r\nin May of this year. We look forward with anticipation to\r\nthe second meeting next year in Geneva. The inter-sessional\r\nwork programme established under the Convention has been\r\nlaunched successfully and will address such crucial issues\r\nas technology and stockpile destruction at forthcoming\r\nsessions in Geneva. To make this inter-sessional work\r\nprogramme effective, we urge all States parties to provide\r\ncomplete and timely information, as required under article\r\n7, and we invite all States which have yet to ratify the\r\nConvention to provide, on a voluntary basis, the\r\ninformation described in article 7.\r\nWhen I travel within or outside of Canada, I am often\r\nasked: What difference has the Ottawa Convention made?\r\nThe answer is simple: The Convention has provided the\r\ninternational community with a framework for action with\r\nrespect to the mine problem, planting the seeds of hope that\r\nthis is an issue on the way to solution. It has also\r\nestablished an international standard. No longer will\r\ncountries be able to use landmines with impunity. Mined\r\nland is being cleared and returned to the community. In\r\nCroatia, 50 per cent of all mined roads, infrastructure and\r\ninhabited areas have been cleared. Casualty rates are\r\ndropping. In Afghanistan and Cambodia, casualty rates\r\nfell by almost half between 1993 and 1998.\r\nLandmine survivors are now receiving more services\r\nand greater recognition. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, 38\r\nclinics have been set up, providing a full range of\r\nservices to landmine victims. Stockpiled mines are also\r\nbeing destroyed at an impressive rate. Since the beginning\r\nof the Ottawa process, over 14 million mines have been\r\ndestroyed.\r\nThis is not yet a battle won, but over the past two\r\nyears and more we have turned the corner in addressing\r\na severe humanitarian crisis. The challenges ahead are to\r\nmaintain the momentum and to continue to work\r\nconstructively together. The leadership of the United\r\nNations and the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross, as well as the support of all international\r\norganizations, are crucial to this process. We offer the\r\nSecretary-General Canada\u0027s continued cooperation and our\r\nutmost support to achieve a world that is truly mine-free.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Today, the General Assembly is considering for\r\nthe seventh consecutive time the important item on\r\nassistance in mine action. I should like to express our full\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his report, which\r\ncontains most valuable information on the clearance of\r\nmines, which affect almost half the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. The report refers to the First Meeting of\r\nthe States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction, held in May.\r\nThis very important Meeting marked a new stage in\r\ninternational demining efforts.\r\nMines threaten human life everywhere and have\r\nserious social and economic consequences. For this and\r\nother reasons, we have followed with great interest the\r\ndemining efforts of States and attended the First Meeting\r\nin our capacity as an observer. We maintain our observer\r\nstatus because we have some reservations about the\r\nConvention. We believe that the Convention is selective\r\nand does not take into account the need to identify the\r\nlegal responsibility of colonial States that have laid mines\r\non the territories of other States. This issue should be\r\nconsidered in the context of the Convention if the real\r\ngoal is the total abolition of mines and the dangers they\r\npose to all humanity.\r\nFor over 50 years now, my country has been the\r\nvictim of mines laid by other countries. During the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nSecond World War, the warring armies laid mines over vast\r\nswaths of Libyan territory. Studies have shown that there\r\nare tens of millions of such mines in Libya. One study\r\ncarried out by a group of United Nations experts\r\ndetermined that, in the course of various campaigns in\r\nNorth Africa, the Allies and the Axis forces laid between\r\n5 and 19 million explosives and mines. The victorious as\r\nwell as the defeated armies left the countries of the region,\r\nabandoning the mines and the explosives that they had\r\nplanted and stockpiled.\r\nThese mines are now covered by sand and rubble.\r\nThey occasionally explode, claiming men, women, children\r\nand the elderly as victims, who may be mutilated,\r\nhandicapped, blinded or killed. Many have fallen to date.\r\nThe study cited in the report before us describes the large\r\nnumber of victims, echoing a previous study cited in\r\ndocument A/38/383, which noted that, in the 30 years\r\nfollowing the Second World War, 4,000 Libyans were\r\nkilled by mines and many thousands more wounded,\r\nincluding women and children.\r\nMines have claimed other victims as well: thousands\r\nof sheep and cattle. They have shut down roads and other\r\nmeans of transportation and hindered our efforts to combat\r\ndesertification and undertake agrarian reform. The United\r\nNations report issued five years ago shows that about 27\r\nper cent of Libya\u0027s cultivable land is strewn with mines.\r\nThis has been an obstacle to our country\u0027s development,\r\nespecially in the coastal areas. The existence of mines has\r\nalso hindered the exploitation of natural resources such as\r\noil, gypsum and iron ore. To cope with this problem, we\r\nhave devised several demining awareness and training\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe facts show that mine clearance with the means\r\npresently available is a very difficult undertaking because\r\nlands strewn with mines are vast and Libya does not have\r\nmaps or enough information about the location of these\r\nmines. In order to deal with these problems, Libya, like\r\nother States, welcomes any assistance provided by the\r\nUnited Nations in the area of mine clearance. Whatever the\r\nassistance or however much it is, it will never be enough to\r\nrid us of the mines and explosives laid in our territory.\r\nI should like to draw attention to the fact that the\r\ncountries that have laid mines in our territory are the parties\r\nprimarily responsible for their clearance and for\r\ncompensating for all damages and losses resulting from\r\nsuch mines. This is a principle that has been adopted by\r\nmany regional and international organizations, such as the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The latter adopted a resolution\r\nrequesting States that have laid mines to make available\r\nto the victim States the geographical location and maps of\r\nsuch mines. These provisions also allow for compensation\r\nto be paid to the victim States.\r\nIn other resolutions, there are similar provisions to\r\nthe effect that the responsibility for those mines and for\r\nthe effects of war is incumbent upon States that have laid\r\nthe mines and caused the damage. They should therefore\r\noffer technical assistance and necessary information,\r\ncompensate States and help them in every way in their\r\ndemining efforts.\r\nWe have expressed earlier our satisfaction with the\r\nagreement that we reached with Italy in July 1998 for\r\nremoving the mines laid in our territory during the\r\nSecond World War. We are pleased with the ensuing\r\ncooperation and the practical measures taken to train\r\npeople in mine clearance and to establish a medical centre\r\nfor the treatment and rehabilitation of victims of these\r\nmines.\r\nThis agreement with Italy is a very positive one. It\r\ncan serve as an example for the other two States that have\r\nplaced mines on our territory — the United Kingdom and\r\nGermany. These countries should cooperate with us in\r\nputting an end to this problem in all its aspects by\r\nproviding us with locator geographical maps for those\r\nmines, as well as providing assistance and compensation\r\nto our people who have suffered from these attacks for\r\nmore than 50 years.\r\nI wish to thank once again the United Nations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and specialized agencies for\r\ntheir efforts to cooperate with us on mine clearance.\r\nHowever, such efforts have so far been focused on mines\r\nlaid under specific circumstances. The Secretary-General\r\ntold us that the activities conducted by the United Nations\r\nshould deal with other aspects as well. The report does\r\nnot refer to mines laid a long time ago, between the two\r\nWorld Wars, and we hope that this will cover all mines,\r\nthe most recent as well the older ones. It is a devastating\r\nforce, and the older mines, like the newer ones, limit our\r\nagrarian reforms and economic development.\r\nIn addition to causing suffering, human losses and\r\ndamage to the environment, all mines are obstacles to\r\ndevelopment. This is a matter of interest to the entire\r\ninternational community, which should spare no effort to\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nremove all mines from the earth and eliminate this danger\r\nwhich threatens this generation and future ones.\r\nMr. de Beauvais (France) (spoke in French): The\r\nFrench delegation fully associates itself with the statement\r\nmade on behalf of the European Union. The draft resolution\r\non assistance in mine action, introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of Finland in the Presidency of the European\r\nUnion, attests to the dedication of the 15 Union members\r\nto the Ottawa Convention, to their will to actively\r\ncontribute to its universalization and to their interest in the\r\nmost appropriate means to achieve this goal.\r\nThe draft resolution highlights in particular significant\r\ndevelopments regarding the issue of technologies made\r\navailable to the international mine clearance community and\r\nnotes the shortcomings in available equipment for detection\r\nand for removing mines which is reliable and financially\r\naccessible. The draft resolution therefore calls once again\r\nfor the strengthening of international cooperation in order\r\nto have a rapid improvement of needed technologies.\r\nThis aspect of the struggle to eradicate the scourge of\r\nanti-personnel mines deserves our attention for two major\r\nreasons: technological progress, which is the indispensable\r\nkey to decisive progress in the field regarding weapons\r\ndisseminated in huge numbers over vast areas, in 60\r\ncountries; and promising scientific progress which we see\r\ntoday here and there. However, a realistic inventory of what\r\ncan be done today highlights the very traditional nature of\r\nthe equipment most often used, the too low level of security\r\nfor those engaged in mine clearance and the very slow pace\r\nof demining operations.\r\nTherefore, the European Union once again launches a\r\ndouble appeal to all those who have the means — Member\r\nStates, intergovernmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations, public and private foundations — to provide\r\nvictim countries appropriate technological assistance and to\r\npromote a coordinated effort of research and development\r\nlikely to come up with safer, more effective and less costly\r\nmethods of technology. It is also relevant to emphasize, as\r\nthe draft resolution does, how much the efforts of this kind\r\nwill be enhanced if they are accompanied by normative\r\nactivities that are genuinely universal in terms of their\r\ntechnical scope as well as their geographical range.\r\nAmong the standing committees of experts formed by\r\nthe States parties to the Ottawa Convention last May in\r\nMaputo, one committee — to which the chairmanship was\r\njointly entrusted, until the next Meeting of the States\r\nParties, to Cambodia and France — is responsible for mine\r\nclearance technology. Its mandate covers various aspects,\r\nto which brief reference was just made, and that is the\r\nburden and the importance of its task.\r\nCalled upon to meet in Geneva, at the International\r\nHumanitarian Demining Centre next December and then\r\nin May next year, it will engage first in an exhaustive and\r\ncritical inventory of the needs of users. Later it will\r\nreview existing techniques and technologies and those\r\nbeing planned in order to be able to provide, in\r\nSeptember 2000 to the States parties, realistic and\r\nbalanced conclusions as to what can and should be done\r\nby the international community to achieve genuine\r\nprogress in this critical area for humanitarian mine\r\nclearance.\r\nThe mandate of the expert group on the technologies\r\nin question therefore requires a mobilization of numerous\r\nplayers next December: the officials of mine action\r\ncentres, active players in non-governmental organizations\r\ninvolved in such activities, regional organizations and\r\ninternational fund-raisers, researchers and analysts, public\r\nand private research and development institutions, and\r\nStates directly or indirectly responsible for research\r\nefforts in the directions earlier referred to. Participation at\r\nthe highest level of responsibility and expertise of these\r\nvarious elements of the international mine clearance\r\ncommunity will be indispensable for the success of that\r\nwork.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme at the outset to express our thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his progress report on assistance in mine\r\naction and the mobilization of resources for the United\r\nNations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine\r\nAction to help in mine clearance. The Fund has\r\ncontributed clearly and positively to addressing this\r\nquestion.\r\nThe attention given to this subject by the General\r\nAssembly since 1993 and the increased attention to it on\r\nthe part of the international community as a whole\r\nexpress awareness of the gravity of the mine problem,\r\nwhich must be dealt with comprehensively, while taking\r\ninto account all the dimensions and aspects of the\r\nproblem. In this regard, Egypt supports the important role\r\nplayed by the United Nations in the field of assistance in\r\nmine action, be it through the Voluntary Trust Fund or\r\nthrough the United Nations Mine Action Service. It is our\r\nhope that they both will contribute effectively and\r\npositively to solving the severe repercussions of the\r\nquestion of mines in all its aspects.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nIn paragraph 150, the Secretary-General\u0027s report states:\r\n“Though the level of interest in the global\r\nlandmine crisis remains high, the focus of\r\nconcern for humanitarian and development\r\nassistance by donor Governments and donor\r\norganizations is constantly being pulled in many\r\ndirections. Each new humanitarian crisis\r\ninevitably draws the world\u0027s attention and\r\nresources away from other, equally worthwhile\r\ncauses.”\r\nAs a mine-affected country, Egypt fully concurs with what\r\nthe Secretary-General has stated in that paragraph. Once\r\nagain, we reaffirm the need to attach the same level of\r\nimportance to all mine problems, whether they are old or\r\nrecent. They must all be dealt with in a fair and balanced\r\nmanner.\r\nOn another level, we have detected in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report a clear emphasis on the humanitarian\r\ndimension of the mine problem alone, without giving the\r\nother interrelated dimensions of the problem as a whole the\r\nsame emphasis. While we appreciate the importance of the\r\nhumanitarian dimension of the mine problem, we also deem\r\nit necessary that all the other aspects of the problem —\r\nwhether related to development, economics, demographics\r\nor security — must be dealt with, in order to arrive at a\r\ncomprehensive solution to the mine problem and not an\r\ninconclusive, palliative one.\r\nIn this regard, I cannot fail to recall the conclusion of\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s 1997 report, which stated that it was\r\nhigh time to define the scope and magnitude of the mine\r\nproblem once and for all and that a more accurate global\r\nassessment was necessary. According to that report, such\r\nassessment would take into account a number of elements,\r\nincluding political, humanitarian, developmental, economic\r\nand security-related ones.\r\nAllow me now to deal with the problem of landmines\r\nin my country, Egypt. The problem is the presence of\r\nnearly 23 million landmines laid in an area of more than\r\n288,000 hectares of Egyptian territory. This constitutes a\r\nhuge obstacle to the development of these regions. Most of\r\nthese mines were laid by the warring parties during the\r\nBattle of El-Alamein in October and November 1942.\r\nThe Egyptian authorities are currently implementing,\r\nwithin their financial capabilities, an ambitious plan to clear\r\nEgyptian territory of the landmines laid by the warring\r\nparties during the Second World War. Action under this\r\nplan has been carried out since July 1991.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to reiterate the following\r\npoints: first, the implementation of this plan places huge\r\ntechnical and financial burdens that the Egyptian\r\nGovernment should not bear alone. Secondly, there is an\r\nurgent and immediate need for the countries that laid\r\nmines in Egyptian territory to provide accurate maps and\r\ninformation on their location, in addition to assistance in\r\ntheir clearance. Thirdly, the cost of clearing these mines\r\nhas risen sharply, since a large number of them are\r\ncurrently buried under thick layers of sand. In view of the\r\nsand dune shifts in that area over the years, some of those\r\nmines are a few metres below the surface.\r\nFourthly, the presence of such a huge number of\r\nmines over a very large area clearly thwarts the efforts of\r\nthe Egyptian Government to use and exploit natural\r\nresources in that land. It is also an obstacle to the\r\ndevelopment efforts carried out by the Egyptian\r\nGovernment in both the Western desert and Sinai. Fifthly,\r\nthese mines, most of which are a mixture of anti-\r\npersonnel and anti-tank landmines, have caused and\r\ncontinue to cause humanitarian losses and obstacles that\r\nthe human conscience cannot afford to overlook.\r\nAbsent from the Secretary-General\u0027s report is a\r\nreference to the responsibility of those States that laid\r\nmines in the territory of other States in the past. Also\r\nabsent from the report is the call to those States to\r\nprovide assistance to clear the mines that they laid —\r\nthose mines, which as I said before, have caused\r\ninnumerable human tragedies and developmental\r\nobstacles.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt regrets once again that the\r\nreport did not contain the question of the responsibility of\r\nthe countries that have laid the mines as one of the\r\naspects of the problem as a whole. In this regard, I would\r\nlike to reaffirm that mine clearance is not the\r\nresponsibility of the affected countries alone; it is also the\r\nresponsibility of the States that laid the mines in the\r\nterritories of others. In addition, mine clearance is the\r\nresponsibility of the international community as a whole.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the view expressed in the\r\nstatement made by Finland on behalf of the European\r\nUnion regarding the responsibility of the parties that have\r\nlaid mines in the territories of other States.\r\nThe concept of demining has been further developed\r\nsince the signing of the Ottawa Convention. This question\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nis being treated from a new perspective that takes into\r\naccount a number of considerations, in addition to those\r\npertaining to demining per se, including rehabilitation and\r\nadvocacy. This is reflected in the draft resolution under this\r\nagenda item, the title of which was changed from\r\n“Assistance in mine clearance”, its title at the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly, to “Assistance in mine\r\naction”. Although we do not object to this new tendency,\r\nwe continue to believe that attention must be focused\r\nprimarily on demining operations intended to prevent\r\nfurther suffering and human losses.\r\nIn this connection, I must refer to the fact that despite\r\nthe prompt international response by many States to sign\r\nand ratify the Ottawa Convention — whose humanitarian\r\nobjectives have gained my Government\u0027s sympathy — a\r\nnumber of other States, including Egypt, have numerous\r\nreservations about the Convention. Those reservations have\r\nbeen raised at several international forums. We therefore\r\nbelieve that it is necessary to conduct a more\r\ncomprehensive study of the problem of mines at the\r\ninternational forum devoted to this issue, namely the\r\nConference on Disarmament.\r\nFinally, I would like to express our gratitude to the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations Mine Action\r\nService for its praiseworthy efforts in this regard. I would\r\nagain like to reaffirm Egypt\u0027s full readiness to cooperate\r\nwith the United Nations Mine Action Service on this\r\nimportant issue.\r\nMr. Bakhit (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The clearance\r\nof anti-personnel landmines is one of the fundamental\r\ncomponents of post-conflict peace-building, given the\r\nenormous number of landmines in the world, the huge costs\r\nof mine clearance and the fact that the impact of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines goes beyond directly endangering\r\npersons and property and covers a wide spectrum of socio-\r\neconomic aspects in mine-affected countries. Given the\r\nhumanitarian danger anti-personnel landmines represent to\r\ncivilians, and as one of the African countries affected, the\r\nSudan supports international efforts aimed at eliminating\r\nlandmines.\r\nThe Sudan was one of the first signatories to the\r\nOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction. We have taken part in\r\nmany regional and international conferences seeking the\r\nelimination of these devastating weapons. In this regard, the\r\nSudan welcomes the entry into force of the Convention on\r\n11 March 1999 and the outcome of the First Meeting of the\r\nStates Parties to the Convention, which was held at\r\nMaputo in May of this year.\r\nThe General Assembly welcomed Sudan\u0027s signature\r\nof the Convention in its resolution 53/1O of 17 December\r\n1998 regarding Operation Lifeline Sudan and appealed to\r\nthe United Nations and the international community to\r\nextend the necessary mine clearance assistance to the\r\nSudan.\r\nThe Sudan has organized several seminars and\r\nconferences within the framework of local mine\r\nawareness efforts aimed at receiving domestic and foreign\r\nsupport for mine clearance efforts. Moreover, a national\r\ncommittee on mine clearance was established in 1997,\r\nconsisting of representatives of the Government,\r\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations. It has\r\nundertaken several mine action activities, identified the\r\nneeds of the Sudan in the field of mine clearance and\r\ndeveloped comprehensive programmes on mine\r\nawareness. It has also been urging the international\r\ncommunity to extend assistance to support national efforts\r\nin mine clearance and to develop national capabilities in\r\nboth mine clearance and victim rehabilitation.\r\nI would also like to mention the activities undertaken\r\nby the Institute for Disaster and Refugee Studies in\r\nKhartoum and by the artificial limbs centre, which\r\noperates under the Ministry of Social Planning in the\r\nSudan.\r\nThe Sudan continues to look forward to receiving\r\ninternational support in the field of technical assistance\r\nand advanced technology for mine clearance in the\r\nframework of domestic efforts to achieve stability and\r\nsecurity for the civilian population.\r\nThe United Nations report on anti-personnel\r\nlandmines issued in April of this year indicated that the\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has\r\nresponded to a request by the Sudan for assistance in\r\nmine clearance. The Office conducted surveys in the\r\nSudan in 1997 and prepared a report on the question of\r\nlandmines in the Sudan that reflects the country\u0027s financial\r\nneeds for clearing those mines. However, it is with deep\r\nregret that the report indicated a lack of international\r\nfunding necessary to implement national mine clearance\r\nprogrammes in the Sudan.\r\nWhile we praise the efforts deployed by the Mine\r\nAction Service as the focal point to coordinate mine\r\naction within the United Nations, which efforts are\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nreflected in the report of the Secretary-General in document\r\nA/54/445 — which also gave details of the activities of\r\nagencies such as the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund and\r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross in the\r\nSudan — my country nevertheless hopes that these bodies\r\nwill continue their efforts to mobilize the necessary funding\r\nto assist with mine awareness and victim assistance\r\nprogrammes in the Sudan.\r\nAs a signatory to the Ottawa Convention, we hope that\r\nall States parties to the Convention will be treated equally\r\nwith regard to mine clearance assistance and that the focus\r\nwill not be only on certain geographical regions. We call\r\nfor international assistance to secure the materiel,\r\nequipment, technology and financial resources necessary for\r\nmine clearance in the mine affected countries.\r\nMr. Santos (Mozambique): I would like to\r\ncongratulate the President for the excellent manner in which\r\nhe is conducting the affairs of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation commends the inclusion on the agenda\r\nof the General Assembly of item 35, entitled “Assistance in\r\nmine action”, to which my Government attaches great\r\nimportance.\r\nMy delegation has studied with great interest the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/54/445) and considers\r\nthe document well balanced and informative.\r\nLandmines are responsible for a large number of\r\ncasualties and for the suffering of innocent civilians,\r\nespecially in countries affected by internal conflicts. The\r\nwidespread and indiscriminate use of landmines has become\r\na characteristic feature mostly of countries in conflict.\r\nLandmines represent serious obstacles to political stability\r\nand to economic and social development. They impede the\r\nreintegration and return of hundreds of thousands of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons to their fertile land, and they\r\ncause economic, environmental and psychological\r\ndegradation.\r\nAs a result of the long years of conflict in\r\nMozambique, about 2 million landmines have been planted.\r\nMost of them do not have a clear mapping system. Even in\r\nthose areas with mapped minefields, natural disasters such\r\nas heavy rain and flooding have moved a large number of\r\nlandmines from their original positions, thus hampering the\r\ndemining efforts being carried out by my Government with\r\nthe assistance of the international community. Regardless of\r\nthe difficulties we are facing in the implementation of\r\nvarious programmes and field activities, my Government\r\nremains fully committed to devoting adequate attention to\r\nthe question of landmines.\r\nIn the struggle against landmines, strengthening and\r\nenhancing the national capacity of affected countries is of\r\nparamount importance. It was within this context that my\r\nGovernment has transformed the National Demining\r\nCommission into the National Demining Institute. This\r\nmove is meant to give the new institution the necessary\r\nautonomy, flexibility and effectiveness and to ensure\r\nbetter interaction with our cooperating partners in mine\r\naction programmes.\r\nMy Government’s commitment to put an end to the\r\nscourge of landmines is unquestionable and led us to host\r\nin Maputo the First Meeting of the States Parties to the\r\nConvention on anti-personnel mines. That Meeting\r\nadopted the Maputo Declaration, which contains political\r\nguidelines and recommendations for the eradication of\r\nlandmines worldwide. We believe that the international\r\ncommunity must sustain the momentum built in Maputo\r\nthrough its full participation in the inter-sessional work\r\ntaking place in Geneva.\r\nMy delegation would like to stress that no\r\ngovernment, international agency or non-governmental\r\norganization on its own has the capacity to deal with the\r\nproblem of landmines. Furthermore, there are no quick\r\nfixes or single solutions to the humanitarian problems\r\ncaused by landmines. To achieve tangible results in the\r\nstruggle against these insidious weapons, we must work\r\ntogether.\r\nThe ultimate goal of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction is the total eradication of landmines from our\r\nplanet. To achieve this objective, we need a\r\ncomprehensive set of actions that can be tailored to the\r\nneeds and special conditions of each mine-affected\r\ncountry. In our view, this set of actions includes: mine\r\nawareness and the education of children, women, the\r\nelderly and communities on the dangers of landmines;\r\ndisciplined surveys to determine the extent of the problem\r\nin the countries seriously affected; demining of priority\r\nareas that have important economic and social value,\r\nincluding the provision of equipment, financial support\r\nand training to host country deminers, thus enhancing\r\nnational demining capacity; and medical, social and\r\npsychological assistance for the rehabilitation and\r\nreintegration of landmine victims.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nThe true measure of success in this struggle is not\r\nonly the total number of landmines removed from the\r\nground, but also the improvement of socio-economic\r\nconditions in affected countries. In Mozambique, for\r\ninstance, we have cleared 6,000 kilometres of roads, and\r\nthousands of hectares of farmlands have been put back into\r\ncultivation, allowing displaced persons and refugees to\r\nreturn to their homes and resume their normal life.\r\nTo achieve the goals envisaged in the Convention on\r\nanti-personnel mines, international cooperation and\r\nassistance is essential. The international community should\r\nstrengthen and enhance mine action centres in affected\r\ncountries in order to empower peoples to address their own\r\nproblems. The international community should help the\r\ncountries in need to create and maintain a database of\r\nlandmines, demining programmes and victim assistance\r\nefforts around the world.\r\nThese steps, combined with the global humanitarian\r\ndimension of mine action, constitute a pragmatic approach\r\ntowards eliminating the threat of landmines around the\r\nworld by the year 2010, as envisaged in the Convention.\r\nThis is a concrete challenge that enjoys the strongest\r\nsupport from the 136 States signatories and 89 ratifiers of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nBefore I conclude, let me emphasize that, as we deal\r\nwith the landmine issue and its destructive power, we have\r\nto reflect thoroughly on how best to eliminate the scourge\r\nof anti-personnel mines. We must strengthen the alliance\r\namong States and civil society, thus pooling our talents in\r\nthis great battle against landmines.\r\nFinally, it is our sincere hope that the growing\r\nawareness and action on the issue of anti-personnel mines\r\nat various levels, including in the Security Council, will\r\nresult in concrete actions that will relieve the suffering of\r\ninnocent children, women and elderly persons worldwide.\r\nThe faster we act, the more lives we save and the more\r\nprosperity we create for present and future generations.\r\nMr. Yamazaki (Japan): At the outset, I should like to\r\ntake this opportunity to express the deep appreciation of my\r\ndelegation to the Secretary-General and other members of\r\nthe Secretariat of the United Nations, and in particular the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations and the Mine\r\nAction Service, as well as to all the countries and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that have taken initiatives and\r\nmade efforts to achieve progress in the area of mine action.\r\nAnti-personnel landmines are one of the most urgent\r\nproblems that the international community faces today.\r\nEven now, at the end of the century, more than 110\r\nmillion landmines remain in the ground in about 70\r\ncountries, where they pose a continuing danger to\r\ninnocent children playing on the ground and diligent\r\nfarmers working in the field, as well as to peacekeepers\r\nand humanitarian personnel.\r\nIn the light of the inhumane nature of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, which cause human suffering in the most\r\nrandom and brutal manner, the resulting problems must\r\nbe addressed as a threat to human life, survival and\r\ndignity. This is the concept of human security about\r\nwhich Prime Minister Obuchi of Japan is profoundly\r\nconcerned. I feel strongly that, from the standpoint of\r\nensuring human security, the international community\r\nmust work together and with perseverance to tackle the\r\nissue of landmines.\r\nNot only do these devices claim human lives, but\r\nthey remain a serious obstacle to reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment during the post-conflict nation-building\r\nprocess, because the actual or suspected existence of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines means that access is denied to much-\r\nneeded resources and services. Even if we assume that no\r\nnew landmines will be laid, it has been estimated that it\r\nwould take many decades to totally eliminate existing\r\nmines at the present pace of clearing 100,000 a year. As\r\nfor the cost of demining, while a landmine can be\r\nobtained for about $3, it costs the international\r\ncommunity between $300 and $1,000 to remove it. This\r\nis an intolerable situation.\r\nIn the last few years, the international community\r\nhas made significant progress in combating the evil of\r\nlandmines by establishing an international legal\r\nframework. I am referring, of course, to the Convention\r\non the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, which was concluded in September 1997 and\r\nwhich entered into force last March, less than one and a\r\nhalf years later. The Convention can already boast more\r\nthan 130 signatories and more than 85 ratifiers, Japan\r\nbeing one of them. We held the First Meeting of the\r\nStates Parties to the Convention last May in Maputo,\r\nwhere we adopted a Declaration reaffirming our\r\nunwavering commitment to the total eradication of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines. I would like to urge non-signatory\r\ncountries to become parties to the Convention as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nJapan has extended mine-related assistance for more\r\nthan 10 years. The Tokyo Conference on Anti-personnel\r\nLandmines in March 1997 was the first attempt to deal\r\ncomprehensively with demining activities and victim\r\nassistance. Participants identified three important fields in\r\nwhich international efforts should be strengthened: first,\r\nlandmine clearance by the United Nations and other\r\norganizations; secondly, development of new technology for\r\nmine detection and removal; and thirdly, assistance to\r\nlandmine victims. Each of these three fields embodies a\r\ncore concept that is the basis for mine action.\r\nAt the Ottawa Signing Conference in 1997, then\r\nForeign Minister Obuchi proposed that we establish a goal\r\nof “zero victims”, and this idea was adopted in the Maputo\r\nDeclaration by the States parties to the Ottawa Convention.\r\nThe assistance provided by Japan to realize this objective\r\nis based on three principles.\r\nThe first principle is ownership. This is the principle\r\nthat mine-affected countries should play a primary role in\r\nmine action activities. For this purpose, it is important for\r\ndonors to assist mine-affected countries in setting up\r\ndomestic structures for mine action, with an emphasis on\r\ncapacity-building. For its part, for example, Japan has\r\nsupported the establishment of mine action centres in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Cambodia. In these\r\ncountries, mine action centres have played an important role\r\nas a domestic focal point in the establishment and\r\ndevelopment of national mine clearance, mine awareness\r\nand victim assistance capacities. Japan truly hopes that\r\nmine action centres recently established with our financial\r\nassistance in Chad and Thailand will also prove successful.\r\nThe second principle is partnership. It is essential for\r\ndonor countries, international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations involved in mine action to\r\ncoordinate their activities. Accordingly, coordination\r\nthrough the United Nations system is important, and Japan\r\nwishes to emphasize the important role that the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) plays as the focal\r\npoint for coordination and the sharing of information on\r\nmine action by the related United Nations agencies,\r\nregional organizations, national Governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations all over the world.\r\nThe third principle is human security, a theme I\r\ntouched on earlier, which refers to all efforts to ensure\r\nhuman survival, well-being and dignity. It is clear that the\r\nproblem of landmines must be addressed as a threat to\r\nhuman security.\r\nThe financial assistance Japan provides through\r\ninternational organizations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and bilateral channels has amounted to more\r\nthan $40 million to date. It includes disbursements to the\r\nAfghanistan project and the demining project in Peru\r\nmanaged by the United Nations Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) respectively,\r\nthe fund for the Cambodian Mine Action Centre,\r\nmanaged by UNDP, the United Nations Voluntary Trust\r\nFund for Assistance in Mine Action managed by\r\nUNMAS, and other institutions, such as the Organization\r\nof American States and the International Committee of\r\nthe Red Cross. Through the United Nations Voluntary\r\nTrust Fund, Japan has assisted mine action in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Croatia, Angola, Laos, Yemen, Cambodia,\r\nNicaragua, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Chad and Guatemala in\r\nclose consultation with UNMAS. Japan is now seeking\r\npossibilities of assisting in mine action in Ecuador. At the\r\nOttawa Signing Conference, then Foreign Minister Obuchi\r\nannounced that Japan would contribute 10 billion yen, or\r\nabout $80 million in this area over a five-year period\r\nbeginning in 1998, in order to achieve the goal of “zero\r\nvictims”.\r\nIn summary, the position of Japan on the issue of\r\nassistance in mine action is based on the three principles.\r\nThey are ownership, or promoting the efforts of mine-\r\naffected countries themselves; partnership, or promoting\r\ncoordination of the activities of agencies of the United\r\nNations, regional organizations, national Governments and\r\nnon-governmental organizations; and human security, or\r\npromoting the survival, well-being and dignity of all\r\npeople. Because it is for the well-being of all people that\r\nwe have dedicated our efforts in this field, it is natural\r\nthat we should have set for ourselves the goal of “zero\r\nvictims”.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that Japan will do\r\nits utmost to provide the financial, technological and\r\nhumanitarian resources necessary to ensure that\r\ninternational efforts are successful in achieving the goal\r\nof “zero victims”.\r\nMr. Wang Lei (China) (spoke in Chinese): China\r\nunderstands the humanitarian concerns of the international\r\ncommunity concerning the indiscriminate killing and\r\nmaiming of innocent civilians by landmines, and supports\r\nthe humanitarian efforts in this regard. The Chinese\r\nGovernment attaches great importance to the question of\r\nthe indiscriminate killing and maiming of civilians by\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nlandmines, and supports the appropriate and reasonable\r\nregulation of the use of landmines.\r\nSince 1992, the Chinese Government has conducted\r\ntwo large-scale demining activities in the border areas of\r\nYunnan and Guangxi provinces. According to incomplete\r\nstatistics, over 2.2 million landmines and unexploded\r\nordnance have been cleared, more than 7 million tons of\r\nunexploded ordnance have been destroyed, an area of 240\r\nsquare kilometres has been cleared of landmines and over\r\n170 roads and ports in border areas have been opened.\r\nMore than 60,000 acres of arable land, grassland, forests\r\nand mountains have been reclaimed.\r\nThe Chinese Government actively supports and\r\nparticipates in international mine action activities and has\r\ncapabilities to provide assistance to mine-affected countries.\r\nThis year and next, there will be 52 trainees from mine-\r\naffected countries, and a number of personnel from United\r\nNations agencies will come to China to attend the training\r\nworkshops conducted by China in cooperation with United\r\nNations agencies. The first workshop is now under way.\r\nChina, even as a developing country, has the capacity\r\nto join in the efforts of the international community to\r\ncontinue to carry out international assistance in mine action\r\nand to open up more peaceful and safe land for mine\r\naffected countries.\r\nMr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Russian Federation traditionally attaches\r\ngreat importance to the range of problems surrounding mine\r\nclearance, to the mobilization of efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to overcome the negative consequences of the\r\ndanger of mines — which impede the social and economic\r\nrestoration of States affected by conflicts — and to a\r\nsolution to urgent humanitarian problems.\r\nWe can clearly see the humanitarian aspect of the\r\nserious issue of mines, and we consider international\r\ncooperation in the area of mine clearance an important part\r\nof the solution to the complex task of post-conflict\r\nresolution. We understand all too well the sufferings of\r\npeople in all corners of the globe who have fallen victim to\r\nmines, because we, in fact, have first-hand knowledge of\r\nthis problem. Yearly in the territory of Russia, more than\r\n100,000 unexploded ordnance are discovered and destroyed,\r\nand the direct costs for these operations exceed 25 million\r\ndollars a year.\r\nWe agree to a ban on the production, use, stockpiling\r\nand transfer of anti-personnel mines as the ultimate\r\nobjective of agreed international efforts. The Russian\r\nFederation favours gradual progress toward this goal\r\nthrough a number of agreed-upon interim stages,\r\nincluding the establishment of viable alternatives to this\r\ntype of defensive weapon. At this stage we consider as a\r\nparticularly important objective the providing for the\r\nbroadest possible participation of members of the\r\ninternational community in the amended Protocol II, the\r\n“Mines” Protocol, to the Convention on Inhumane\r\nWeapons of 1980, and unswerving compliance with the\r\nnorms and standards which it has introduced. The basis of\r\nthis document is a carefully adjusted balance of the\r\ninterests of States which takes into account their real\r\npossibilities, security and self-defense interests. We hope\r\nthat in the very near future, we will be able to formalize\r\nlegally our participation in the Protocol.\r\nWe are convinced of the urgency of the problem of\r\nstepping up efforts of the international community to\r\nmake fuller use of the potential of States and of the\r\nUnited Nations in mine clearance in areas of regional\r\nconflicts. In light of the above, we consider as relevant\r\nthe problem of improving the convergence of the\r\nactivities of various United Nations organs and making\r\nfull use of their knowledge and resources. On the whole,\r\nin our view, there are good reasons for having the United\r\nNations play a leading role in the coordination of\r\ntechnical assistance and in organizing national potential\r\nfor mine clearance. We are also hoping for real additions\r\nin the very near future to the Voluntary Trust Fund for\r\nAssistance in Mine Clearance established by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nFor Russia, questions of interaction with the United\r\nNations, exchanges of experience and receiving technical,\r\nfinancial and material assistance are of very real and\r\npractical importance. In particular, we are referring to the\r\nfact that during the implementation of peacekeeping\r\noperations on the territory of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States, complex and costly issues are being\r\nresolved with regard to mine clearance localities and\r\nobjectives.\r\nRussia is ready, on an ever larger scale, to take an\r\nactive part in rendering assistance in mine clearance on a\r\nbilateral or multilateral basis to countries in need. We\r\nhave acquired impressive scientific, technical and\r\nindustrial potential and expertise in the area of mine\r\nclearance which could be put to use in future international\r\nprogrammes in this sphere.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nMr. Castellón Duarte (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nI have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the\r\ncountries of Central America and the Dominican Republic.\r\nIn the first place, we would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on assistance in mine\r\naction, document A/54/445, which contains important\r\ninformation on the activities of mine clearance which are\r\nunder way in various parts of the world.\r\nMine clearance operations in Central America are a\r\nhumanitarian task of the greatest importance for the region,\r\nsince thousands of anti-personnel mines and other explosive\r\ndevices were planted there indiscriminately over the past\r\ndecade. These weapons, most of them of produced\r\nindustrially, are true death-traps for the rural population.\r\nAnti-personnel mines have caused loss of human life, of\r\nlivestock and of domestic animals and have been a constant\r\nthreat to the civil population. They have blocked the use of\r\nvast fertile lands for agriculture, consequently impeding\r\ndevelopment in general and limiting the increase in work\r\nopportunities.\r\nBecause of the fact that in many cases mines were\r\nplanted without any plan and that hurricane Mitch and the\r\nresulting floods in November 1998 sometimes managed to\r\nredistribute them to new sites and farm fields, the tasks of\r\nmine clearance have become more urgent than ever, making\r\nthe process slower, more dangerous and more costly.\r\nProducing these mines was incredibly cheap,\r\napproximately one dollar per mine, which allowed these\r\nweapons of war to be easily acquired by the parties in\r\nconflicts who planted them, including indiscriminately in\r\nborder zones of neighbouring countries which had no part\r\nin the conflicts. This is the case, for example, of mined\r\nterritories in Honduras and Costa Rica. In contrast to the\r\ncost of production, the cost of removing the mines and\r\ndetonating them is more than a thousand dollars per mine,\r\nwithout taking into account the human, social and\r\necological costs resulting from each mine.\r\nIn view of the urgency and importance of mine\r\nclearance for the peoples of Central America, and upon the\r\nrequest of the affected countries — Costa Rica, Honduras\r\nand Nicaragua — in 1991 the Organization of American\r\nStates (OAS) provided support to the mine-clearance\r\nactivities being conducted by these countries. The OAS —\r\nwith the Centre for the Promotion of Democracy providing\r\ncoordination and supervision, and the Inter-American\r\nDefense Board providing technical assistance — made\r\npossible the development of a programme to assist\r\nCentral American demining efforts.\r\nThis programme involves the coordinated\r\nparticipation of several components: the donor countries,\r\nwhich are the source of funds; contributing countries\r\nmembers of the OAS which provide specialized demining\r\ntechnology; and the beneficiary countries — in the case\r\nof Central America, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras\r\nand Nicaragua — which, with the help of the other\r\ncountries, provide the sapper team: young people who are\r\ndedicated, disciplined and courageous and who risk their\r\nlives in carrying out their very sensitive and dangerous\r\nwork. Recently, trained dogs have begun to be used,\r\nespecially to sniff out and detect explosives in a given\r\narea. This programme also includes the placing of signs\r\nand reducing risks.\r\nIt is appropriate to thank those countries that\r\ncontribute to this Central American demining programme.\r\nSome of them, such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile,\r\nColombia, El Salvador, the United States, Peru, Uruguay\r\nand Venezuela, are members of the OAS; others, such as\r\nGermany, Spain, the Russian Federation, France, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden and\r\nSwitzerland, are permanent observers of the OAS. Special\r\nassistance has also been provided by Denmark and\r\nNorway.\r\nEl Salvador is another country that has suffered from\r\nthe use of anti-personnel mines. Its Government began a\r\nmine-clearance programme under the supervision of the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador, utilizing\r\na sapper team jointly composed of personnel from the El\r\nSalvador armed forces and ex-combatants of the Frente\r\nFarabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional. They have\r\nundertaken a variety of mine-clearance programmes. We\r\napplaud the cooperation of former enemies that these\r\noperations involve.\r\nAnti-personnel mines cause unnecessary harm, and\r\nwe believe it is unnecessary to prove the tremendous\r\nburden for the entire medical systems of each of our\r\ncountries of providing medical and social assistance to the\r\nvictims of mines, from the evacuation of the wounded\r\nright through to his rehabilitation and reintegration into\r\nsociety. Thus we believe it is very important to point out\r\nthe joint programme of Mexico, Canada and the\r\nPan American Health Organization for caring for victims\r\nof anti-personnel mines in El Salvador, Honduras and\r\nNicaragua. This programme has been structured to deal\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nwith both the physical and psychological rehabilitation of\r\nthe survivors of mine explosions.\r\nThe United Nations and its agencies have also made\r\na significant contribution to demining operations in Central\r\nAmerica. The United Nations Children’s Fund has been\r\nconducting educational programmes on the dangers of\r\nmines in various regions where this scourge remains. In\r\nresponse to a request for assistance from the President of\r\nNicaragua, a project of the United Nations Mine Action\r\nService has made it possible to demine a 527,000-square-\r\nmetre area around four bridges that were destroyed by\r\nfloods caused by hurricane Mitch along the northern section\r\nof the main road between Managua and Honduras.\r\nThe will of our Governments to eliminate these deadly\r\ndevices has been reiterated in various forms, one of which\r\nwas the ratification by our countries of the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction — the Ottawa Convention. Another\r\nmanifestation of this will was the joint declaration of the\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs at the meeting on the progress\r\nof Central American demining activities, which was held on\r\n13 April 1999. This declaration reaffirms the commitment\r\nof our Governments to the tasks of demining and\r\ndestroying explosive devices, as well as the firm will to\r\ncomplete as soon as possible national mine-destruction\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn conclusion, we appeal to the international donor\r\ncommunity to continue to cooperate with demining\r\nprogrammes in Central America in order to rid the region\r\nof this scourge and let it become a zone free from anti-\r\npersonnel mines.\r\nMr. Khan (Pakistan): My delegation wishes to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on assistance in mine\r\naction, contained in document A/54/445.\r\nPakistan remains deeply concerned about the serious\r\nproblem caused by the indiscriminate use of landmines, a\r\nproblem that is deeply affecting the lives of millions of\r\nordinary people in more than 60 developing countries,\r\nincluding Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nCambodia, Iraq, Mozambique and Somalia. The problem\r\ncontinues to manifest itself in various forms. It impedes the\r\neffective execution of peacekeeping operations,\r\nrehabilitation of refugees and displaced persons, and post-\r\nconflict rebuilding and reconstruction.\r\nPakistan appreciates the growing international\r\ninterest in dealing with this problem in its totality. Over\r\nthe past few years concerted efforts have been made to\r\nsensitize world public opinion about the seriousness and\r\nmagnitude of the problem caused by the indiscriminate\r\nuse of anti-personnel landmines. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation notes with appreciation the positive\r\ncontribution made by the United Nations. Efforts to\r\nachieve an integrated and coherent approach\r\nencompassing the entire United Nations system are likely\r\nto yield positive results.\r\nWe continue to follow with great interest the broad\r\nrange of activities undertaken by the United Nations on\r\nlandmines-related issues since the designation of the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations as the overall\r\nfocal point and the United Nations Mine Action Service\r\nas the operational focal point on these issues. We\r\nwelcome and remain supportive of various steps that have\r\nbeen taken to further strengthen the role and capabilities\r\nof the United Nations in this vitally important area.\r\nWe have noted with interest the change in\r\nterminology from “mine clearance” to “mine action”, with\r\na view to adopting a much broader and holistic approach\r\nto dealing with the landmines issue. While welcoming this\r\nbroader focus it is essential not to lose sight of the fact\r\nthat actual demining and mine clearance on the ground\r\nremains at the heart of efforts to deal with this problem.\r\nAlthough mine-awareness and advocacy campaigns are\r\nimportant facets of an overall strategy, these activities\r\nshould in no way divert resources or attention from\r\ndemining and mine clearance.\r\nSimilarly, global conferences and international\r\ninstruments on landmines should focus greater attention\r\non the need for more resources for actual demining\r\noperations in the countries afflicted by this problem. It is\r\na matter of concern that resources for these activities have\r\nnot shown the desired increase, even though the\r\ninternational community today is more sensitized than\r\never before to the seriousness and gravity of the\r\nlandmines crisis. It is hoped that the international\r\ncommunity, especially the developed countries, will\r\ncontribute more resources to overcome this challenge.\r\nPakistan for its part has actively contributed to demining\r\noperations all over the world. Our participation in\r\ndemining operations in Kuwait, Cambodia, Angola,\r\nEastern Slovenia and Western Sahara reflects our\r\ncommitment to dealing with the crisis caused by the\r\nindiscriminate use of landmines.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nIn our view, the issue of mine action needs to be\r\ndifferentiated from the demands for controlling or banning\r\nthe use of landmines. The question of control of the use of\r\nlandmines raises issues that lie in the realm of disarmament.\r\nThese issues should be dealt with in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament. In this context, Pakistan favours the initiation\r\nof negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament on an\r\ninternational legal instrument banning the transfer/export of\r\nanti-personnel landmines.\r\nPakistan imposed a moratorium on the export of\r\nlandmines in March 1997. This moratorium has been\r\nreinforced by the issuance of an appropriate notification by\r\nthe Government of Pakistan completely banning the export\r\nof anti-personnel mines. We have also ratified the amended\r\nProtocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional\r\nWeapons. We look forward to participating constructively\r\nin the First Annual Conference of High Contracting Parties\r\nto Amended Protocol II, to be held in Geneva this year.\r\nPakistan has submitted information required under article\r\n11 (2) and article 13 (4) of the amended Protocol II to the\r\nUnited Nations, which will be available to the participants\r\nof the Conference of High Contracting Parties. Steps now\r\nneed to be taken to ensure universal adherence to the\r\namended Protocol II of the Convention. We remain ready\r\nto consider further measures and initiatives in relevant\r\nmultilateral forums to address the problems arising out of\r\nthe indiscriminate use of landmines.\r\nMr. Tudela (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): At the end of\r\nthe twentieth century, after two World Wars and\r\ninnumerable local conflicts, we find that anti-personnel\r\nlandmines continue to be used in different areas of the\r\nplanet. Two thirds of the world’s countries are\r\ncontaminated by these weapons, which have indiscriminate\r\nand deadly consequences that, by rendering inaccessible the\r\nareas where they are sown, will be felt for many years.\r\nThe permanence of anti-personnel landmines\r\nexacerbates tensions, undermines trust and obstructs\r\ndiplomatic efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to\r\nconflicts. That is why the goal of the complete elimination\r\nof anti-personnel landmines remains a priority for Peru and\r\nfor all those States that seek to eliminate this threat.\r\nPeru has participated since the beginning in the\r\nprocess that led to the adoption of the Ottawa Convention\r\non the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction,\r\nand was one of the first countries to ratify it. We therefore\r\nhail its entry into force in March this year.\r\nThe First Meeting of the States Parties in May in\r\nMaputo, Mozambique, and the Maputo Declaration that\r\nemerged from the Meeting, are important political\r\nexpressions that strengthen the universalization of the\r\nConvention. We therefore believe it necessary for those\r\nStates that are not yet parties to the Convention to sign it\r\nand for the signatory countries to ratify it as soon as\r\npossible. The Meeting served to establish certain\r\nprinciples for the application of the Convention and five\r\nstanding committees of experts for the execution of its\r\nwork programme. Peru is a member of the standing\r\ncommittee of experts on mine clearance, which held its\r\nfirst session last September.\r\nWe believe that it is highly important to continue to\r\nwork to achieve the implementation of the goals and\r\nprovisions of the Ottawa Convention. Our country\r\ntherefore believes it necessary to review the demining\r\nstandards and the criteria used to decide the assignment\r\nof international cooperation; to reassert the existence of\r\nlinks between mine removal and the consolidation of\r\npeace and mutual trust between neighbouring countries;\r\nthe possible participation of armed forces in demining\r\noperations; and the need for the primacy of national\r\ndecisions in the planning and management of mine-action\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn the work of demining, we should also bear in\r\nmind the fact that the Ottawa Convention complements\r\nother international mechanisms on this subject; the\r\necological value of the areas of acknowledged\r\nbiodiversity; the preservation of traditional\r\nanthropological patterns; the priority to be given to\r\ncooperation aimed at training national authorities in\r\ncharge of planning and managing programmes of anti-\r\nlandmine measures within affected countries; the\r\nacknowledgment of the contribution that the regional\r\ncoordination mechanisms for demining, such as the\r\nOrganization of American States, can offer; and the\r\nadvisability of exchanging experiences with other affected\r\ncountries, non-governmental organizations and the United\r\nNations Development Programme.\r\nPeru also believes that the affected countries must\r\ndecide whether their armed forces are capable of\r\ndemining and that international cooperation must assign\r\npriority to the training in all areas that is required by\r\nmedium-and long-term anti-mine measures. We share the\r\nposition in favour of linking demining plans with specific\r\ndevelopment projects.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nConsistent with its position against the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and those with injurious and\r\nindiscriminate effect, in 1997 Peru ratified the Convention\r\non Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\r\nConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be\r\nExcessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and\r\nits Protocols, including Amended Protocol II on\r\nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-\r\ntraps and Other Devices.\r\nWe welcome the First Annual Conference of the High\r\nContracting Parties to Amended Protocol II, to be held from\r\n15 to 17 December this year in Geneva. We also wish to\r\nstate that Peru has complied with its obligation, in its\r\ncapacity as a country that has ratified and deposited the\r\nConvention, to submit to the Secretary-General its first\r\nannual report, in accordance with article 13 (4) of the\r\namended Protocol II.\r\nWithin the regional framework, Peru, together with\r\nother States, has promoted and supported the decision to\r\nmake the western hemisphere a zone free of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines and the creation of a register of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. It has also created a specific mechanism for\r\ninternational cooperation, consisting of a regional list of\r\ndemining experts, in order to supplement the efforts of the\r\nStates to translate the provisions of the Ottawa Convention\r\ninto reality within their respective territories. It has also\r\nproposed a project to contribute to the universalization of\r\nthe Ottawa Convention in the Americas by creating a group\r\nof personalities to publicize the Convention and its scope\r\nthroughout civil society.\r\nUniversalization and cooperation are two essential\r\naspects we must consider if we wish to achieve genuine\r\nimplementation of the Ottawa Convention. Concerted\r\ninternational efforts should not be limited to the prohibition\r\nof anti-personnel landmines. They should also include\r\nfinancial and technical assistance to the countries affected\r\nby the mines, specifically for their removal and for\r\nhumanitarian assistance to mine victims and survivors.\r\nThe Peruvian delegation wishes to express its gratitude\r\nfor the extensive and substantive report submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General on this subject. We are pleased to see\r\nthat the policy laid down by the United Nations on the\r\ncoordination of efforts, activities and resources is now more\r\neffective. We make an appeal that the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Service activities be supplied with sufficient and\r\nforeseeable financial resources that will allow it to develop\r\nits coordination tasks properly.\r\nWe also believe that it is important to develop\r\nnational awareness and extensive coordination at the\r\nnational level to build sustainable national capacity.\r\nAccess to new technologies for the removal of anti-\r\npersonnel mines is also fundamental.\r\nAt the national level Peru has established a juridical\r\nand institutional framework that supplements international\r\nactivities on mines. An inter-sectorial coordination group\r\nhas been set up to evaluate and recommend the political,\r\nlegal and administrative measures that must be adopted in\r\norder to implement the Ottawa Convention in Peru. Some\r\nof the measures recommended by that group have already\r\nbeen approved, including in particular the steps taken so\r\nthat the armed forces and police forces reconvert the\r\nfacilities used to manufacture mine prototypes and\r\nwithdraw, inventory and destroy mines in order to protect\r\nthe basic infrastructure, to train national personnel in\r\ntasks related to demarcation of mined areas, to remove,\r\ndeactivate and destroy mines and to facilitate the\r\nrehabilitation of the victims.\r\nPeru began mine removal from its territory in\r\nDecember 1996, under a two-stage programme. The first\r\nstage was mine removal associated with the demarcation\r\nof the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border, which, under mutual\r\nagreement with Ecuador, was performed with national\r\nresources and the supplementary technical and financial\r\nsupport of four friendly countries: Canada, Spain, the\r\nUnited States and Japan, to whom we reaffirm our\r\ngratitude for their swift and favourable acceptance of our\r\nrequests for assistance. I have the pleasure of reporting\r\nthat that stage was concluded last May.\r\nThe second stage consists of medium- and long-term\r\nnational mine removal, a task which is undergoing\r\nevaluation and logistics planning. Due to the magnitude\r\nof the problem and the climatic and geographic\r\ncharacteristics of mined zones, we believe that this stage\r\ncan be executed within the time-frame stipulated by the\r\nOttawa Convention only if we can gain access to\r\ntechnical and financial cooperation and to logistical\r\nsupport given by other States parties to the Ottawa\r\nConvention, non-governmental organizations and\r\ninternational organizations that are committed to the cause\r\nof achieving a world free of anti-personnel mines.\r\nIt is obvious that such measures are extremely\r\nexpensive, particularly for a developing country such as\r\nPeru. In this context, we wish to emphasize that a fund\r\nspecifically for support of mine removal in Peru has been\r\nopened within the framework of the Organization of\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 18 November 1999\r\nAmerican States in order to continue receiving international\r\ncooperation for projects for prevention, assistance to victims\r\nand gradual demining throughout our national territory.\r\nAs in former years, Peru has co-sponsored the draft\r\nresolution which is being submitted on this subject, which\r\nwe hope the General Assembly will again adopt by\r\nconsensus.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate for this meeting. We shall hear the\r\nremaining speakers tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. as the\r\nfirst item.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
