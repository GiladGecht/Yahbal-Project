(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alberto Fujimori, President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Alberto Fujimori, President of the Republic of\r\nPeru, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru, His Excellency Mr.\r\nAlberto Fujimori, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Fujimori (spoke in Spanish): The\r\ndelegation of Peru is greatly pleased, Sir, at your election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession, especially since Peru was an active participant in\r\nNamibia’s independence process, which was advanced by\r\nthe United Nations. As the first speaker at this morning’s\r\nmeeting I am particularly pleased to congratulate you and\r\nthe other officers of the General Assembly.\r\nThe arrival of the new millennium is a great historic\r\nopportunity to initiate an era of peace, progress and well-\r\nbeing, from which no people on Earth should be excluded.\r\nThat requires a greater commitment on the part of the\r\ninternational community to create conditions that will\r\nenable developing nations properly to channel their own\r\nenergy and potential with a view to achieving\r\ncomprehensive national development.\r\nAt the height of the twentieth century, the majority\r\nof the world’s peoples remain mired in the social, cultural\r\nand technological conditions of the nineteenth century —\r\nor even of earlier centuries. We shall be able truly to\r\nspeak of a new era only if our aspirations for the twenty-\r\nfirst century and the third millennium become tangible\r\nreality for those peoples and if those peoples succeed in\r\nfulfilling their own legitimate aspirations: in other words,\r\nif a globalized world can globalize well-being and dignity.\r\nThe conversion of our economies to adapt them to\r\nglobalization has social costs which we can bear provided\r\nthat this process assures us a future of development and\r\nwell-being, not one of additional frustrations. Such\r\nfrustrations could arise if our national economies, rather\r\nthan growing stronger, are weakened by economic\r\nopening based on unequal or unjust terms of trade. The\r\nreaction, which no one wishes to see, could be a return to\r\ndefeated economic ideas.\r\nIn speaking of my own country, Peru, I can say that,\r\nlike other peoples, it inherited a heavy burden of injustice\r\nand backwardness, but it also has an extraordinary future-\r\nlooking calling that has made it possible over the past 10\r\nyears for our country to become an emerging economy.\r\nThat future-looking calling has enabled us to defeat\r\nthe totalitarian, terrorist designs of the Shining Path and\r\nof the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. It was the\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nlatter group that seized the residence of the Japanese\r\nAmbassador in 1996.\r\nThe destructive capacity of such criminal activity is on\r\nthe increase thanks to access to new technology, and today\r\nit threatens every region and every continent. If it is not\r\nduly stopped, it will undoubtedly become the nightmare of\r\nthe twenty-first century. Both internal and external peace\r\nare essential for the coming of the new era that we are\r\nchampioning.\r\nIn 1998, Peru and Ecuador were at a crossroads: either\r\nto pursue the path of armed conflict, the situation typical of\r\nthe entire century, which has led to the destruction of\r\npeoples; or to follow the path of peace, the only possibility\r\nfor development. Peru and Ecuador chose peace. The 1998\r\npeace agreement between Peru and Ecuador was the\r\nproduct of two equally important factors: the political will\r\nof two Governments taken to its ultimate conclusion; and\r\nthe capacities, energy and awareness of two peoples\r\ndetermined to overcome old prejudices and work towards\r\na future of development. Ecuador and Peru intend to reach\r\nthe twenty-first century without the baggage of the\r\nnineteenth. Peace has opened up possibilities for the\r\ndevelopment of Peru and of Ecuador thanks to savings in\r\nresources once earmarked for defence, and it has shown\r\nagain that Latin America is a mature region that rejects\r\nwarlike tension.\r\nBut tranquility in our region has been disturbed by the\r\nalliance of drug trafficking and terrorism. In some cases,\r\nthese criminal activities have created power sufficient to\r\nchallenge States as well as to upset the world economy:\r\nillicit drug money may have infiltrated productive,\r\ncommercial and even political activities. Terrorism and drug\r\ntrafficking therefore represent a threat to modern society\r\nand to good governance.\r\nIn general terms, poverty, terrorism, drug trafficking\r\nand racial discrimination are the main barriers to our\r\nglimpsing the new era that as civilized peoples we propose\r\nto reach. Our task and our commitment is to overcome\r\nthese obstacles with firm political will if we want this\r\ntransitional period in which we live to mark the threshold\r\nof a new era for mankind.\r\nThe concepts of democracy and fairness must prevail.\r\nIt is important to promote democracy within countries, but\r\nalso to promote it between countries and between peoples.\r\nDemocracy applies not only to the internal structure of\r\nStates, but also to the international relations that will\r\ndetermine the fate of the world.\r\nHuman rights raised to their maximal power and\r\nhighest expression are the rights of peoples, and all\r\npeoples have a right to the future.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Peru for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alberto Fujimori, President of the Republic of\r\nPeru, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. William J. Clinton, President of the\r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the United States of America.\r\nMr. William J. Clinton, President of the United\r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the United States of America, His Excellency\r\nMr. William Jefferson Clinton, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Clinton: Today, we look ahead to the\r\nnew millennium. And at this last General Assembly of the\r\ntwentieth century, we look back on a century that taught\r\nus much of what we need to know about the promise of\r\ntomorrow. We have learned a great deal over the last one\r\nhundred years: how to produce enough food for a\r\ngrowing world population; how human activity affects the\r\nenvironment; the mysteries of the human gene. An\r\ninformation revolution now holds the promise of universal\r\naccess to knowledge. We have learned that open markets\r\ncreate more wealth, that open societies are more just. We\r\nhave learned how to come together, through the United\r\nNations and other institutions, to advance common\r\ninterests and values.\r\nYet for all our intellectual and material advances, the\r\ntwentieth century has been deeply scarred by enduring\r\nhuman failures: by greed and lust for power, by\r\nhot-blooded hatreds and stone-cold hearts. At century’s\r\nend, modern developments magnify greatly the dangers of\r\nthese timeless flaws. Powerful forces still resist\r\nreasonable efforts to put a human face on the global\r\neconomy, to lift the poor, or to heal the earth’s\r\nenvironment. Primitive claims of racial, ethnic or religious\r\nsuperiority, when married to advanced weaponry and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nterrorism, threaten to destroy the greatest potential for\r\nhuman development in history, even as they make a\r\nwasteland of the soul.\r\nTherefore, we look to the future with hope, but with\r\nunanswered questions. In the new millennium, will nations\r\nbe divided by ethnic and religious conflicts? Will the\r\nnation-state itself be imperiled by them, or by terrorism? Or\r\nwill we keep coming closer together instead, while enjoying\r\nthe normal differences that make life more interesting? In\r\nthe new century, how will patriotism be defined — as faith\r\nin a dream worth living, or as fear and loathing of other\r\npeople’s dreams? Will we be free of the fear of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, or forced to teach our grandchildren how\r\nto survive a nuclear, chemical or biological attack? Will\r\nglobalism bring shared prosperity, or will it make the\r\ndesperate of the world even more desperate? Will we use\r\nscience and technology to grow the economy and protect\r\nthe environment, or put it all at risk in a world dominated\r\nby a struggle over natural resources?\r\nThe truth is that the twentieth century’s amazing\r\nprogress has not resolved these questions. But it has given\r\nus the tools to make the answers come out right — the\r\nknowledge, the resources, the institutions. Now, we must\r\nuse them. If we do, we can make the millennium not just\r\na changing of the digits, but a true changing of the times —\r\na gateway to greater peace, prosperity and freedom. With\r\nthat in mind, I offer three resolutions for the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nFirst, let us resolve to wage an unrelenting battle\r\nagainst poverty and for shared prosperity so that no part of\r\nhumanity is left behind in the global economy.\r\nGlobalization is not inherently divisive. While infant\r\nmortality in developing countries has been cut nearly in half\r\nsince 1970, life expectancy has increased by 10 years.\r\nAccording to the United Nations Human Development\r\nIndex, which measures a decent standard of living, a good\r\neducation, a long and healthy life, the gap between rich and\r\npoor countries on this measure has actually declined.\r\nOpen trade and new technologies have been engines\r\nof this progress; they have helped hundreds of millions to\r\nsee their prospects rise by marketing the fruits of their labor\r\nand creativity abroad. With proper investments in education,\r\ndeveloping countries should be able to keep their best and\r\nbrightest talent at home and to gain access to global\r\nmarkets for goods and services and capital.\r\nBut this promising future is far from inevitable. We\r\nare still squandering the potential of far too many. As many\r\nas 1.3 billion people still live on less than a dollar a day.\r\nMore than half the population of many countries has no\r\naccess to safe water. A person in South Asia is 700 times\r\nless likely to use the Internet than someone in the United\r\nStates. Forty million people a year still die of hunger,\r\nalmost as many as the total number killed in World\r\nWar II. We must refuse to accept a future in which one\r\npart of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new\r\neconomy, while the other lives at the knife edge of\r\nsurvival.\r\nWhat must we do? We can start by remembering\r\nthat open markets advance the blessings and\r\nbreakthroughs we want to spread. That is why we in the\r\nUnited States have worked to keep our markets open\r\nduring the recent global financial crisis, though it has\r\nbrought us record trade deficits. It is why we want to\r\nlaunch a new global trade round when the World Trade\r\nOrganization meets in Seattle this fall. It is why we are\r\nworking to build a trading system that strengthens the\r\nwell-being of workers and consumers, protects the\r\nenvironment and makes competition a race to the top, not\r\nthe bottom. It is why I am proud we have come together\r\nat the International Labour Organization to ban abusive\r\nchild labour everywhere in the world.\r\nWe do not face a choice between trade and aid, but\r\ninstead the challenge to make both work for people who\r\nneed them. Aid should focus on what is known to work:\r\ncredit for poor people starting businesses, keeping girls in\r\nschool, meeting the needs of mothers and children.\r\nDevelopment aid should be used for development, not to\r\nbuy influence or finance donors’ exports. It should go\r\nwhere Governments invest in their people and answer to\r\ntheir concerns.\r\nWe should also come to the aid of countries\r\nstruggling to rise but held down by the burden of debt.\r\nThe G-7 nations have adopted a plan to reduce by up to\r\n70 per cent the outstanding debt of the world’s poorest\r\ncountries, freeing resources for education, health and\r\ngrowth.\r\nAll of us, developed and developing countries alike,\r\nshould take action now to halt global climate change.\r\nWhat has that to do with fighting poverty? A great deal.\r\nThe most vulnerable members of the human family will\r\nbe hurt first and hurt most if rising temperatures devastate\r\nagriculture, accelerate the spread of disease in tropical\r\ncountries and flood island nations.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nDoes this mean developing countries must sacrifice\r\ngrowth to protect the environment? Absolutely not.\r\nThroughout history, a key to human progress has been\r\nwillingness to abandon big ideas that are no longer true.\r\nOne big idea that is no longer true is that the only way to\r\nbuild a modern economy is to use energy as we did in the\r\nindustrial age. The challenge and opportunity for\r\ndeveloping countries today is to skip the costs of the\r\nindustrial age by using technologies that improve the\r\neconomy and the environment at the same time.\r\nFinally, to win the fight against poverty, we must\r\nimprove health care for all people. Over the next 10 years\r\nin Africa, AIDS is expected to kill more people and orphan\r\nmore children than all the wars of the twentieth century\r\ncombined. Each year diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis\r\nand pneumonia leave millions of children without parents\r\nand millions of parents without children. Yet for all these\r\ndiseases, vaccine research is advancing too slowly, in part\r\nbecause the potential customers are too poor. Only 2 per\r\ncent of all global biomedical research is devoted to the\r\nmajor killers in the developing world.\r\nNo country can break poverty’s bonds if its people are\r\ndisabled by disease and its Government overwhelmed by\r\nthe needs of the ill. With United Nations leadership, we\r\nhave come close to eradicating polio, once the scourge of\r\nchildren everywhere. We are down to 5,000 reported cases\r\nworldwide. I have asked our Congress to fund a major\r\nincrease to finish the job, and I ask other nations to follow\r\nsuit. We have begun a comprehensive battle against the\r\nglobal AIDS epidemic. This year I am seeking another\r\n$100 million for prevention, counselling and care in Africa.\r\nI want to do more to get to those who need them most new\r\ndrugs that prevent transmission from mothers to newborns.\r\nAnd today I commit the United States to a concerted effort\r\nto accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines for\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and other diseases that\r\ndisproportionately affect the developing world. Many\r\napproaches have been proposed, from tax credits to special\r\nfunds for the purchase of these vaccines.\r\nTo tackle these issues, I will ask public-health experts,\r\nthe chief executive officers of our pharmaceutical\r\ncompanies, foundation representatives and members of\r\nCongress to join me at a special White House meeting and\r\nto strengthen incentives for research and development,\r\nworking with, not against, the private sector to meet our\r\ncommon goal.\r\nThe second resolution I hope we will make today is to\r\nstrengthen the capacity of the international community to\r\nprevent and whenever possible to stop outbreaks of mass\r\nkilling and displacement. This requires, as we all know,\r\nshared responsibility, like the one West African nations\r\naccepted when they acted to restore peace in Sierra\r\nLeone; the one 19 democracies in the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) embraced to stop ethnic\r\ncleansing in Bosnia and in Kosovo; the one that Asian\r\nand Pacific nations have now assumed in East Timor,\r\nwith the strong support of the entire United Nations,\r\nincluding the United States.\r\nSecretary-General Annan spoke for all of us during\r\nthe Kosovo conflict, and more recently in regard to East\r\nTimor, when he said that ethnic cleansers and mass\r\nmurderers can find no refuge in the United Nations, no\r\nsource of comfort or justification in its Charter. We must\r\ndo more to make these words real. Of course, we must\r\napproach this challenge with some considerable degree of\r\nhumility. It is easy to say “never again”, but much harder\r\nto make it so. Promising too much can be as cruel as\r\ncaring too little.\r\nBut difficulties, dangers and costs are not an\r\nargument for doing nothing. When we are faced with\r\ndeliberate, organized campaigns to murder whole peoples\r\nor expel them from their land, the care of victims is\r\nimportant but not enough. We should work to end the\r\nviolence. Our response in every case cannot and should\r\nnot be the same. Sometimes collective military force is\r\nboth appropriate and feasible. Sometimes concerted\r\neconomic and political pressure combined with diplomacy\r\nis a better answer, as it was in making possible the\r\nintroduction of forces to East Timor. Of course, the way\r\nthe international community responds will depend on the\r\ncapacity of countries to act and on their perception of\r\ntheir national interests. NATO acted in Kosovo, for\r\nexample, to stop a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing\r\nin a place where we had important interests at stake and\r\nthe ability to act collectively.\r\nThe same considerations brought Nigerian troops and\r\ntheir partners to Sierra Leone and Australians and others\r\nto East Timor. That is proper — so long as we work\r\ntogether, support each other and do not abdicate our\r\ncollective responsibility. I know that some are troubled\r\nthat the United States and others cannot respond to every\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe in the world. We cannot do\r\neverything, everywhere. But simply because we have\r\ndifferent interests in different parts of the world does not\r\nmean we can be indifferent to the destruction of innocents\r\nin any part of the world. That is why we have supported\r\nthe efforts of Africans to resolve the deadly conflicts that\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nhave raged through parts of their continent. It is why we\r\nare working with friends in Africa to build the African\r\nCrisis Response Initiative, which has trained more than\r\n4,000 peacekeepers from six countries. It is why we are\r\nhelping establish an international coalition against genocide\r\nto bring nations together to stop the flow of money and\r\narms to those who commit crimes against humanity.\r\nThere is also a critical need for countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict to build police institutions accountable to\r\npeople and the law, often with the help of civilian police\r\nfrom other nations. We need international forces with the\r\ntraining to fill the gap between local police and military\r\npeacekeepers, as French, Argentine, Italian and other\r\nmilitary police have done in Haiti and Bosnia. We will\r\nwork with our partners and the United Nations to continue\r\nto ensure that such forces can deploy when they are needed.\r\nWhat is the role of the United Nations of in preventing\r\nmass slaughter and dislocation? Very large. Even in\r\nKosovo, NATO’s actions followed a clear consensus,\r\nexpressed in several Security Council resolutions, that the\r\natrocities committed by Serb forces were unacceptable and\r\nthat the international community had a compelling interest\r\nin seeing them end. Had we chosen to do nothing in the\r\nface of this brutality, I do not believe we would have\r\nstrengthened the United Nations. Instead we would have\r\nrisked discrediting everything it stands for.\r\nBy acting as we did, we helped to vindicate the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter to\r\ngive the United Nations the opportunity it now has to play\r\nthe central role in shaping Kosovo’s future. In the real\r\nworld, principles often collide and tough choices must be\r\nmade. The outcome in Kosovo is hopeful.\r\nFinally, as we enter this new era, let our third\r\nresolution be to protect our children against the possibility\r\nthat nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will ever be\r\nused again. The last millennium has seen constant advances\r\nin the destructive power of weaponry. In the coming\r\nmillennium, this trend can continue or, if we choose, we\r\ncan reverse it with global standards universally respected.\r\nWe have made more progress than many realize. After\r\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus, Kazakhstan and\r\nUkraine courageously chose to give up their nuclear\r\nweapons. America and Russia have moved forward with\r\nsubstantial arms reductions. President Yeltsin and I agreed\r\nin June, even as we await Russian ratification of START II,\r\nto begin talks on a START III treaty that will cut our cold-\r\nwar arsenals by 80 per cent from their height. Brazil has\r\njoined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), capping a process that has almost totally\r\neliminated the threat of nuclear proliferation in Latin\r\nAmerica. We have banned chemical weapons from the\r\nEarth, though we must implement that commitment fully\r\nand gain universal coverage. One hundred and fifty-two\r\nnations have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty and, while India and Pakistan did test nuclear\r\nweapons last year, the international reaction proved that\r\nthe global consensus against proliferation is very strong.\r\nWe need to bolster the standards to reinforce that\r\nconsensus. We must reaffirm our commitment to the\r\nNPT, strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and\r\nmake fast progress on a treaty to ban production of fissile\r\nmaterials. To keep existing stocks from the wrong hands,\r\nwe should strengthen the Convention on Physical\r\nProtection of Nuclear Materials. And today, again I ask\r\nour Congress to approve the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty.\r\nWe must stop the spread of nuclear weapons,\r\nmaterials and expertise at the source. Since 1992, we have\r\nworked with Russia and the other nations of the former\r\nSoviet Union to do that. We are expanding that effort\r\nbecause challenges remain, but thus far we can say that\r\nthe nightmare scenario of deadly weapons flowing\r\nunchecked across borders and of scientists selling their\r\nservices en masse to the highest bidder has been avoided.\r\nNow, we must work to deny weapons of mass\r\ndestruction to those who would use them. For almost a\r\ndecade, nations have stood together to keep the Iraqi\r\nregime from threatening its people and the world with\r\nsuch weapons. Despite all the obstacles Saddam Hussein\r\nhas placed in our path, we must continue to ease the\r\nsuffering of the people of Iraq. At the same time, we\r\ncannot allow the Government of Iraq to flout 40 — and\r\nI say 40 — successive United Nations Security Council\r\nresolutions and to rebuild his arsenal.\r\nJust as important is the challenge of keeping deadly\r\nweapons away from terrorist groups. They may have\r\nweaker capabilities than States, but they have fewer\r\ncompunctions about using such weapons. The possibility\r\nthat terrorists will threaten us with weapons of mass\r\ndestruction can be met with neither panic nor\r\ncomplacency. It requires serious, deliberate, disciplined\r\nconcern and effective cooperation from all of us.\r\nThere are many other challenges. Today I have\r\nspoken about just three: the need to do something about\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nthe world’s poor and to put a human face on the global\r\neconomy; the need to do more to prevent killing and\r\ndislocation of innocents; the need to do more to ensure that\r\nweapons of mass destruction will never be used on our\r\nchildren. I believe they are the most important. In meeting\r\nthem, the United Nations is indispensable.\r\nIt is precisely because we are committed to the United\r\nNations that we have worked hard to support the effective\r\nmanagement of this body. But the United States also has a\r\nresponsibility to equip the United Nations with the\r\nresources it needs to be effective. As I think most Members\r\nknow, I have strongly supported the United States meeting\r\nall its financial obligations to the United Nations and I will\r\ncontinue to do so. We will do our very best to succeed this\r\nyear.\r\nWhen the cold war ended, the United States could\r\nhave chosen to turn away from the opportunities and\r\ndangers of the world. Instead, we have tried to be engaged,\r\ninvolved and active. We know this moment of unique\r\nprosperity and power for the United States is a source of\r\nconcern to many. I can only answer by saying this: In the\r\nseven years that I have been privileged to come here to\r\nspeak to this body, America has tried to be a force for\r\npeace. We believe we are better off when nations resolve\r\ntheir differences by force of argument rather than force of\r\narms. We have sought to help former adversaries like\r\nRussia and China become prosperous, stable members of\r\nthe world community because we feel far more threatened\r\nby the potential weakness of the world’s leading nations\r\nthan by their strength. Instead of imposing our values on\r\nothers, we have sought to promote a system of\r\ngovernment — democracy — that empowers people to\r\nchoose their own destinies according to their own values\r\nand aspirations. We have sought to keep our markets open\r\nbecause we believe a strong world economy benefits our\r\nown workers and businesses, as well as the people of the\r\nworld who are selling to us. I hope that we have been and\r\nwill continue to be good partners with the rest in the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nNot long ago, I went to a refugee camp in Macedonia.\r\nThe people I met there, children and adults alike, had\r\nsuffered horrible, horrible abuses, but they had never given\r\nup hope because they believed that there is an international\r\ncommunity that stands for their dignity and their freedom.\r\nI want to make sure that, 20 or 50 or 100 years from now,\r\npeople everywhere will still believe that about our United\r\nNations. So let us resolve, in the bright dawn of the new\r\nmillennium, to bring in an era in which our desire to create\r\nwill overwhelm our capacity to destroy. If we do that, then,\r\nthrough the United Nations and far-sighted leaders,\r\nhumanity finally can live up to its name.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. William J. Clinton, President of the United\r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe, His Excellency\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: Mr. President, I wish to express\r\nmy warm congratulations to you upon your election to the\r\npresidency of this fifty-fourth session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. Your unanimous election to\r\nthe presidency is not only an attestation to the confidence\r\nwe in Africa have in your leadership ability, but is also\r\nan affirmation of the faith the international community\r\nhas in you to steer this organ successfully into the twenty-\r\nfirst century. You take up the helm of this body at a\r\ncritical juncture, when we are here taking stock of where\r\nwe stand on the eve of the new millennium.\r\nLet me avail myself of this opportunity to express\r\nour sincere gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMinister Didier Opertti of Uruguay, who presided over\r\nthe affairs of this Assembly in a diligent and exemplary\r\nmanner. We thank him for his conscientious efforts and\r\nsterling contribution.\r\nMay I also express our great appreciation of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, having\r\nrecognized the great opportunities and challenges ahead\r\nof us, has worked tirelessly to help us map a noble vision\r\nfor the future of our Organization.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nWe are also witnessing another historic moment for\r\nour Organization, as we admit into our midst three new\r\nmembers: Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga. We welcome them to\r\nour brotherhood of nations and wish them all the best as\r\nthey chart their own destinies and make their contribution\r\nwithin our community of nations.\r\nOn our African continent, the holding of free and fair\r\nelections in Nigeria has ushered in a democratic\r\ndispensation worthy of our attention. This transformation\r\nserves as a monument erected to inform the international\r\ncommunity that Africa has said \"No\" to the\r\ninstitutionalization of the route map from barracks to the\r\nState House, which hitherto the military has traversed with\r\nimpunity. Further, the return to peace and democracy in\r\nLiberia and Sierra Leone bears ample testimony to Africa’s\r\nrenewed quest for democracy, peace and stability. It is,\r\ntherefore, our fervent hope that the implementation of these\r\npeace agreements will lead to the restoration of normality\r\nin the region.\r\nIn the same spirit, the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) alliance intervened in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo to uphold one of the most\r\nfundamental tenets of the United Nations Charter: respect\r\nfor the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nAggression, under whatever pretext, should be condemned\r\nand opposed by the United Nations. We are, therefore,\r\nencouraged by the eventual participation of the rebels in the\r\npeace process.\r\nWe wish to register our most sincere gratitude to His\r\nExcellency President Chiluba of Zambia for his untiring\r\nefforts that succeeded in bringing the rebels on board this\r\npeace process. It must be emphasized, though, that the\r\nsuccess or failure of a peacekeeping mission to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo will be determined by\r\nthe availability of both human and material resources. We\r\nare, however, worried that an inadequately funded\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo peacekeeping operation\r\nwould be a clear manifestation of Africa’s increasing\r\nmarginalization in the new world order. We trust, therefore,\r\nthat the United Nations will now render the requisite\r\nsupport to sustain this achievement.\r\nWe find this an opportune moment to call upon the\r\ninternational community not only to put its full weight\r\nbehind African peace initiatives, but also to assess and\r\nbuttress the institutional and operational capacity of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts in Africa. In this\r\nvein, we hail the European Union’s declaration that its\r\nfuture engagement with the belligerents involved in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo conflict would depend\r\non the latter’s fulfilment of their obligations as spelt out\r\nin the Lusaka ceasefire agreement.\r\nSadly, the gains that we registered in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo peace process are being negated\r\nby the renewed bloodbath in Angola, where, for the\r\nsecond time this decade, UNITA has resumed war,\r\ndisregarding the 1994 Lusaka Peace Agreement. We\r\ntherefore call upon the international community to put in\r\nplace effective mechanisms that tighten the embargo\r\nagainst UNITA, particularly in the light of the recently\r\nconcluded mission of Ambassador Robert Fowler,\r\nChairman of the Security Council sanctions committee on\r\nUNITA.\r\nZimbabwe hails the acceptance by Eritrea and\r\nEthiopia of the OAU Framework Agreement to end the\r\nwar in the Horn of Africa. Zimbabwe, as a member of the\r\nhigh-level committee that coordinated the effort to end the\r\nwar between the two African States, calls upon the United\r\nNations to undergird this successful regional peace\r\ninitiative with the necessary technical and other resources\r\nto make the process irreversible and permanent.\r\nSince its inception the United Nations has had on its\r\nagenda a concern for economic and social development.\r\nThe follow-up to the implementation of the goals of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development is currently being\r\nassessed, and it has become evident that a potentially\r\nexplosive social situation confronts the world today. The\r\nsoaring levels of unemployment, the deteriorating\r\nstandards of living, the abject poverty in most\r\ndeveloping countries, especially on our continent, Africa,\r\nare cause for serious concern.\r\nWe note that Africa’s fortunes have continued to\r\nworsen despite the continent’s best efforts. Growth\r\nslowed in the majority of African countries and, at 2.6 per\r\ncent in 1998, average gross domestic product for all of\r\nAfrica fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth\r\nrate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of\r\nsignificantly reducing poverty levels on the continent.\r\nAdverse factors that contribute to this decline include\r\nslower growth of the world economy, declining\r\ncommodity prices, the contagious effects of the Asian\r\nfinancial crisis, the El Niño weather pattern, civil strife\r\nand political turmoil in several spots.\r\nAt a time when greater challenges and opportunities\r\nare emerging within the context of globalization, it is\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\ncrucial that Africa’s nagging vulnerabilities are highlighted\r\nand addressed. Total African export revenues fell by nearly\r\n$14 billion in 1998, to just $112 billion, an 11 per cent\r\ndrop from the 1997 level, mainly due to price declines.\r\nThat negative trend has continued in 1999.\r\nWe are concerned that at a time when prospects for\r\naid effectiveness in Africa are improving significantly,\r\nofficial development assistance to Africa has fallen to its\r\nlowest level. Between 1993 and 1997, total aid receipts in\r\nAfrica fell by nearly 13 per cent, from $21 billion to $18.7\r\nbillion. At this rate, official development assistance flows\r\nhave fallen far short of the $30 billion a year that\r\neconomists estimate is needed to reduce poverty in Africa.\r\nThe net rate of return on investment in African\r\ncountries remains higher than in other developing countries.\r\nIt was estimated at 20 to 30 per cent during 1990 to 1994,\r\non average, as opposed to 16 to 18 per cent for all\r\ndeveloping countries. Yet in contrast to this great potential,\r\nAfrica has not been a significant beneficiary of the dramatic\r\nincrease in global foreign direct investment flows.\r\nAfrica’s debt is essentially non-payable and certainly\r\nunsustainable under any sensible growth-oriented\r\nmacroeconomic scenario. There is an urgent need to release\r\nmore resources from debt servicing to financing\r\ndevelopment and creating conditions that encourage inflows\r\nof private foreign investment. Although the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative constitutes\r\nan important mechanism for debt relief, its eligibility\r\ncriteria are rather restrictive. While the need for better debt\r\nmanagement by Africa in the future is acknowledged, any\r\ncredible solution to Africa’s debt problem must indeed\r\nentail substantial debt cancellation.\r\nWe in Africa are therefore fully persuaded that it is\r\ntime the international community deliberates on the\r\nsubstance and prospects for new aid modalities which\r\nemphasize a holistic and comprehensive approach. There is\r\nneed for us to share views on how best to foster a new\r\ndonor-beneficiary relationship in which multi-donor\r\nprogrammes focus on supporting an African-driven agenda.\r\nIn our own region of southern Africa, we are at an\r\nadvanced stage of setting up a trade protocol meant to\r\nmaximize our earnings from trade. With a majority of our\r\nmembers having ratified this protocol, only a couple more\r\nremain before it is operational.\r\nWe are also keenly aware of the critical role of\r\ntelecommunications as an effective vehicle for successful\r\ninternational trade. Accordingly, my country only recently\r\nagreed to be a subregional host for the AFRITEL, an\r\nAfrican regional telecommunications centre. We trust that\r\ninternational investors will see this as positive\r\npreparedness on the part of our continent not only to\r\nattract them and their investments, but indeed to\r\nconcretely ensure that they also prosper in their\r\nendeavours on our continent.\r\nThe United Nations decade for the progressive\r\ndevelopment and codification of international law is\r\ncoming to a close on an important note, with the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court.\r\nHowever, the Court can be successful only if it is\r\nuniversally accepted. We must, therefore, lend our\r\nunwavering support to this process so that we can\r\ncomplete this important milestone in the history of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs we look into the new millennium, let us aspire to\r\nhave an international order that espouses the twin\r\nobjectives of universal peace and security on the one\r\nhand, and an improved quality of life for all the earth’s\r\ninhabitants on the other. It must be an order characterized\r\nby justice and respect for international law. Such\r\ninternational law must surely have the effect of restraining\r\nboth regional and international belligerent countries. We\r\nshould join enthusiastically in the promotion of the\r\nachievements of the decade for the development of\r\ninternational law.\r\nZimbabwe is greatly disturbed at the cataclysmic\r\nturn of events in East Timor following the self-\r\ndetermination referendum there. The crisis chronicled in\r\nthe report of the Security Council Mission to Jakarta and\r\nDili was most disquieting. Zimbabwe therefore welcomes\r\nthe deployment of the multinational force to restore peace\r\nand security in East Timor and to facilitate the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. We sincerely hope that the\r\nSecurity Council will soon authorize the deployment of a\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force whose financial and\r\nother resource requirements are vouched for by the entire\r\nmembership of this Organization.\r\nIt would be remiss of me not to mention how\r\ninequitable it is that the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil should remain unreflective of the vastly altered\r\ninternational circumstances. The need for the reform of\r\nthe Security Council is no longer just a lofty ideal we\r\nstrive to achieve, but a prerequisite for the very existence\r\nof this Organization. The Security Council, as a principal\r\norgan of the United Nations, is entrusted to act on behalf\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nof the entire membership, which to date has risen to 188\r\ncountries. The stark realities of the situation in the world\r\nmust be reflected not only in the sheer increase in numbers,\r\nbut also in consideration of the democratic principle of\r\nequitable geographical representation and participation.\r\nIt is grossly unjust that we, the developing countries,\r\nshould remain totally unrepresented in the permanent\r\nmembership of a body entrusted with such power and\r\nauthority. The powers and privileges that the current\r\nmembers of the Security Council enjoy should be extended\r\nto all new members if the Council is to be effective.\r\nAnd so, as we hold the last session of the General\r\nAssembly in the current millennium, it behooves us to\r\nmake one giant leap into the future, not only in terms of\r\nwise and bold decisions, but also in terms of the\r\ncommitment to implement them and see them bear fruit for\r\nus and for posterity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alvaro Arzú Irigoyen, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guatemala.\r\nMr. Alvaro Arzú Irigoyen, President of the Republic of\r\nGuatemala, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala, His Excellency Mr.\r\nAlvaro Arzú Irigoyen, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Irigoyen (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nwish first of all to express our satisfaction at your election,\r\nwhich has accorded you the privilege of conducting the\r\ndebate at this fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI wish also to express our conviction that your recognized\r\ndiplomatic and political experience will lead to creative\r\nresults.\r\nI should also like to pay a tribute to the Foreign\r\nMinister of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti, whose diligence at the helm of the Assembly last\r\nsession not only bore witness to his professional abilities,\r\nbut also confirmed the commitment of that American\r\nnation to the principles on which the United Nations is\r\nbased.\r\nExactly three years ago, on first taking the floor\r\nhere, I began by announcing that we were very close to\r\nachieving peace in my country. Today I return to this\r\nAssembly four months before my term of office expires\r\nto summarize all that has transpired during the past three\r\nyears of changes, many of which Guatemalans could not\r\nimagine when we signed the peace accords on 29\r\nDecember 1996.\r\nThe first and most fundamental change that has\r\ntaken place has been in the hearts and minds of\r\nGuatemalans, as can be seen in the way that the former\r\nguerrillas have been brought back in from the cold and\r\nare no longer outlaws, and in the return of the refugees.\r\nAfter over three decades of an internal armed\r\nconflict marked by extreme cruelty, a conflict which was,\r\namong other things, an expression of profound and deep-\r\nrooted political and ideological intolerance, all the\r\nindications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas\r\nwas going to be a complicated and dangerous process.\r\nNevertheless, against all expectations, from the moment\r\nthe ceasefire took hold until the former guerrillas took\r\npart in the electoral process, reintegration has taken place\r\nin an atmosphere not only of security but also of\r\nopenness and tolerance on the part of all sectors of\r\nsociety. I should also like to highlight here the attitude of\r\nthe Guatemalan army, which involved itself fully in the\r\nnegotiating process and made fundamental contributions\r\nto it and then, once the peace accords had been signed,\r\nnot only complied fully with their provisions but was also\r\npositive in its attitude towards them. By acting in\r\naccordance with the spirit of the accords and not just the\r\nletter, it encouraged reconciliation and peaceful\r\ncoexistence with its former adversaries.\r\nAt the local level, both the refugees and the former\r\nguerrillas have returned to their towns and villages and\r\ntoday, in many of those places, development committees\r\nhave been set up composed of returnees, former\r\nguerrillas, former members of the civil patrols and former\r\nmembers of the armed forces, all of them working\r\ntogether to improve the lot of their communities by\r\nstriking at the roots of their problems.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nAlso, at the public policy level, peace has meant social\r\ninvestment on a scale and of a quality unprecedented in our\r\ncountry’s history. That investment has been effected in\r\naccordance with the social ethic and the development logic\r\nof the peace accords, and have also met the specific targets\r\nset in those accords.\r\nThus we have gone farther than anyone has before.\r\nWe have gone as far as the most remote villages and\r\nhamlets and brought them education, health services, roads,\r\nelectricity and water, though we know that much remains\r\nto be done. What we have achieved so far has already\r\nshown that if we can consolidate the opening to progress\r\nwhich our country has made, we can quickly remedy the\r\neffects of so very many years of backwardness.\r\nWe are also investing in the infrastructure and\r\nfacilities needed for production in order to improve the\r\ncountry’s competitive position in the globalized world of\r\ntoday. I would say that these two fundamental aspects I\r\nhave mentioned, the reintegration of the former guerrilla\r\nforces into society and social investment, contain the\r\nfundamental elements on which a new Guatemala will be\r\nbased.\r\nInherent to the processes through which the former\r\nguerrillas have been reintegrated and the refugees have\r\nbeen repatriated are reconciliation, tolerance, respect for\r\ndiversity and legal or otherwise agreed solutions to\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe main thrust of public investment embodies a\r\nsocial ethic based on the common good and a tangible\r\neffort to improve access to opportunities for the least\r\nregarded sectors. Thus both processes form the foundations\r\nfor maintaining and strengthening peaceful coexistence\r\nbetween Guatemalans, which has been the most significant\r\nqualitative result of the peace accords of December 1996:\r\non the one hand, a peaceful settlement to the conflicts and,\r\non the other, increasing efforts to redress the most serious\r\ninjustices and opportunities for development for all.\r\nNevertheless, our internal endeavours have taken place\r\nin an adverse world economic context. As in almost every\r\nother Latin American country, the economy in Guatemala\r\nis experiencing a slowdown and a financial squeeze.\r\nTogether with the effects of the crises in various regions\r\nand the persistent financial speculation that is constantly\r\nchipping away at productive, job-creating investment, the\r\nprices of our main export products have plummeted while\r\nthe cost of our imports, particularly oil, have gone up\r\nsubstantially.\r\nThe negative impact of this situation particularly\r\naffected the strata of our society who are least capable of\r\nfending for themselves. This trend which is mainly caused\r\nby external factors, has been compounded by the direct\r\nand indirect effects of hurricane Mitch, which struck our\r\nsister countries of Honduras and Nicaragua particularly\r\nhard but also brought serious destruction to our own\r\ncountry and seriously affected trade within the Central\r\nAmerican region, on which we are highly dependent.\r\nAs a result, the State’s efforts to boost development\r\ncannot be as successful as they might otherwise be,\r\nparticularly when compared with our people’s\r\nexpectations. We have created investment incentives,\r\nbeginning with political stability, and going on to\r\neducation and training, creation of infrastructure and\r\nprovision of basic services. What has been accomplished\r\nin the way of public works and public services has\r\ngenerated tens of thousands of jobs. The work done on\r\nthe roads and highways and on the electrical grid and\r\ntelecommunications has significantly expanded the main\r\nbases of our economy. As a result of all these and other\r\nendeavours, the effects in our country of the negative\r\neconomic developments taking place abroad have been\r\nless severe than in our sister countries that have stopped\r\ngrowing or have experienced negative economic growth.\r\nWe have created a foundation that will have a\r\npositive impact on the standard of living of the people,\r\nand especially of the neediest. These beneficial results\r\nwill continue if we stay the course.\r\nFor even if we must continue to swim against the\r\ncurrent of the world economy, which is temporarily\r\nimpoverishing us, we have available internal resources\r\nand can count on ongoing processes that are likely to\r\nproduce structural change, provided that the efforts made\r\nover the past four years are consolidated, sustained and\r\ncontinued.\r\nThe Peace Agreements are, for Guatemala, the\r\nstrategic elements of a profound, comprehensive and all-\r\nembracing effort to change our country. They represent\r\nthe basic guidelines for the fundamental transformations\r\nnecessary to build a different Guatemala, one that is\r\nprofoundly democratic and committed to the integral and\r\nsustainable development of its people.\r\nThe peace agenda is equivalent to the\r\ndemocratization of the country, which is conceived as a\r\nfunctional and participatory democracy encompassing the\r\npolitical and cultural domains. A functioning democracy\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\ninvolves reform of the State, and its participatory character\r\nis what enables it to become a social democracy, which in\r\nturn strengthens its functionality.\r\nIn this respect, I cannot fail to mention the substantial\r\nincrease in opportunities for popular participation that has\r\nresulted from the establishment, as mandated in the peace\r\nagreements, of over 15 multi-sectoral commissions, as well\r\nas the measures taken to extend and complement structures\r\nfor the elaboration and adoption of public policy.\r\nAlso noteworthy are the efforts that have been made\r\nto decentralize the State and strengthen local institutions\r\nwith a view to a rapprochement between the Government\r\nand the people and to giving them a greater say in public\r\naffairs.\r\nAnother fundamental process consists in the efforts\r\nbeing made to build a multicultural, plurilingual and multi-\r\nethnic nation. This involves extremely complex work to roll\r\nback centuries of exclusion, discrimination and racism, and\r\nit presupposes profound cultural changes towards the\r\ntolerance and respect necessary for our cultural diversity to\r\nblossom and make the many contributions it can to our\r\nnational development without putting the unity of the\r\ncountry at risk.\r\nIt has also been essential to redefine national security\r\nand defence. This has involved re-examining principles and\r\nrethinking the public security, national defence and\r\nintelligence apparatuses. We have made progress in the\r\nestablishment of a new national civil police. This is a\r\nprofessional body that is trained to focus on the protection\r\nand defence of the individual and collective rights of\r\ncitizens and is sensitive to, and respectful of, ethnic,\r\ncultural and linguistic diversities.\r\nWe have also further reduced our military forces,\r\ncutting back the budget and dismantling bases and other\r\nimportant elements of the military infrastructure, as\r\nprovided for in the Peace Agreements, with the full\r\nconcurrence and participation of the army.\r\nThe progress made in various areas is a source of\r\nlegitimate pride for all Guatemalans as well as for the\r\nStates that, as the Group of Friends, have supported us, and\r\nin particular for the Organization, whose role as our partner\r\nhas enabled us to maintain optimism and hope in the\r\ndifficult task of building peace and development.\r\nGuatemala has been able to benefit from the essence\r\nof what the Organization does best: make available its good\r\noffices and serve as a facilitator in the various phases of\r\nthe management of a conflict, act as an impartial\r\nverifying agency, provide unconditional cooperation and\r\nact as a trusted partner in assisting Member States to\r\nresolve problems.\r\nI wish to stress the paramount importance of the role\r\nthat has been played in Guatemala by the United Nations\r\nVerification Mission in Guatemala, with a view to\r\nensuring progress in the implementation of the Peace\r\nAgreements. The United Nations presence in our country\r\nand the exercise of its advisory and verification functions\r\nwith impartiality and wisdom have contributed\r\nsignificantly to the implementation of the various phases\r\nof the commitments in the Peace Agreements.\r\nOur Government attaches similar importance to other\r\ninitiatives that the United Nations has undertaken in\r\nsupport of Guatemala’s society. Our country is a testing\r\nground for a new assistance framework that aims, among\r\nother things, to impart greater consistency to the work of\r\nthe various agencies of the Organization. Our own\r\nevaluation of the assistance we have received is highly\r\npositive.\r\nThe number of activities the Organization is carrying\r\nout in Guatemala is quite high and increasing. It is\r\ntherefore only fair to emphasize that the various agencies\r\nhave been able to mobilize a considerable amount of\r\nadditional resources from external sources.\r\nAnother positive contribution of the cooperation in\r\nquestion is the tangible impact it has had, through both its\r\ndirect effects and its catalytic function in respect of public\r\nexpenditure and the policies carried out by the\r\nGovernment.\r\nI therefore wish to convey our deep appreciation to\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations, which have at\r\nall times supported the efforts of the various sectors of\r\nGuatemalan society to restore peace. Their political\r\nbacking has been fundamental to the success of those\r\nefforts. I also extend my gratitude to the Secretariat, and\r\nin particular to Mr. Kofi Annan, as well as to the\r\nexecutive organs of the various agencies of the United\r\nNations system, which have interpreted the mandates of\r\nthe Organization and have demonstrated efficiency in\r\ntheir execution.\r\nFinally, we fully appreciate the value of the work of\r\nother multilateral bodies such as the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the Organization of\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nAmerican States, and in particular the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank, which has played a dual role as direct\r\nsource of financial assistance and organizer of the\r\nConsultative Group for Guatemala.\r\nThe success achieved by intergovernmental bodies in\r\nconnection with the Guatemalan peace process is our basic\r\nreason for reiterating our conviction that cooperation\r\nbetween nations is indispensable in order to achieve peace\r\nand development for our peoples. That is why Guatemala\r\nremains firmly committed to the promotion of various kinds\r\nof multicultural and multi-ethnic undertakings, not only in\r\nthe framework of the United Nations but also with respect\r\nto various endeavours at the regional and hemispheric\r\nlevels.\r\nOne of the boldest and most challenging initiatives is\r\nthe one being undertaken by Central America to achieve the\r\neconomic and political integration of the region. Like the\r\nother States that compose the Central American Integration\r\nSystem, Guatemala is convinced that this strategic\r\nassociation strengthens the region in its relations with an\r\nincreasingly competitive world, and it reiterates its\r\ncommitment to continue promoting actions to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of Central American integration.\r\nFor those same reasons, Guatemala wishes to express\r\nits unreserved support for the strengthening of our\r\nOrganization. We are firmly convinced that the United\r\nNations must be the principal forum responsible for\r\nmaintaining world peace. That is why we welcome the\r\nSecurity Council’s prompt response to the crisis in East\r\nTimor. We believe that United Nations involvement in such\r\nsituations confirms its functions as the sole organ\r\ncompetent to decide on the action to be taken in cases\r\nwhere the principle of non-intervention needs to be\r\ninterpreted with due regard to the existence of violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nIn order that such functions be performed adequately,\r\nwe need an Organization that is strong and flexible, with\r\nmechanisms and procedures that are capable of responding\r\nto the challenges of new world realities. We must\r\naccordingly reflect more deeply on the ideal design\r\nstructure of an Organization that must compensate for the\r\nregional imbalances of power that have arisen in the post-\r\ncold-war world. This also means that we should pursue the\r\nreform of the Secretariat and of the intergovernmental\r\nbodies of the United Nations, including the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe believe also that the United Nations should\r\ncontinue to deal with the greatest unfinished task of the\r\ntwentieth century: wiping out world poverty. Together\r\nwith the multilateral financial agencies, our Organization\r\nshould play an indispensable role in ensuring that the\r\nbenefits of globalization are distributed on a democratic\r\nbasis, and that if we must all be exposed to the risks, we\r\nshould all be entitled to enjoy the benefits.\r\nGuatemala appreciates the Organization’s\r\ncontributions to promoting an international climate\r\nenabling disputes between and within States to be settled\r\npeacefully. As a State Member of the United Nations,\r\nGuatemala has always resolved all its international\r\ndisputes in a peaceful manner and in accordance with\r\ninternational law.\r\nWe wish to reiterate to the Assembly our concern\r\nabout the situation of the 22 million inhabitants of the\r\nRepublic of China in Taiwan whose aspirations for\r\nrepresentation in international organizations have not been\r\nsatisfied.\r\nWe welcome the new impetus that has been seen in\r\nthe Middle East peace negotiations and we trust that they\r\nwill lead to a comprehensive resolution of all the\r\noutstanding issues there. After so many years of conflict,\r\nthe countries of the region, including a future Palestinian\r\nState, deserve to live in peace, security, harmony and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThis is the last statement that I will make to the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the representative of my country,\r\nand I should like to conclude by reiterating my people’s\r\ngratitude for the solidarity shown to us in our efforts\r\ntowards peace and development. The support which the\r\npeoples and Governments represented here have bestowed\r\nupon us, together with the strenuous work of the United\r\nNations and its agencies, make us feel honoured, indebted\r\nand motivated.\r\nThe fruit that our peace process has manifestly borne\r\nin such a short time provides clear evidence of the\r\nvalidity and relevance of the system and of the\r\nfundamental, indispensable and inestimable importance of\r\nthe efforts of the Guatemalan people within the country\r\nand of the unquestionable effectiveness of international\r\nfriendship in the form of respectful, timely and effective\r\ncooperation in building a more democratic country and a\r\nmore equitable and united world.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nGuatemala for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alvaro Arzú Irigoyen, President of the Republic of\r\nGuatemala, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Igor S. Ivanov, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Ivanov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian):\r\nThere is no doubt that the twentieth century, which is now\r\ncoming to a close, will leave a deep imprint on the history\r\nof the world. This has been an epoch of global\r\ntransformation and social change, scientific discoveries and\r\nachievements. The realization of the idea of a universal\r\nworld Organization, which has become the foundation\r\nuniting the entire international community, has indeed been\r\none of the positive things about this century.\r\nHowever, the twentieth century has witnessed the most\r\nsevere upheavals. Millions of people have perished in the\r\nflames of world wars, revolutions and civil and ethnic\r\nconflicts. On a few occasions, humanity teetered on the\r\nbrink of self-destruction, and the burden of outstanding\r\nproblems it has left for the new era is a heavy one. We\r\ncannot resolve all these problems before the advent of the\r\nthird millennium, but we are indeed duty bound to lay\r\ndown the foundations for resolving them in the long-term\r\nand to start moving in that direction.\r\nThe most important thing we should do is to define\r\nthe parameters of the world in which we are going to live.\r\nThis lies at the core of the initiative put forward by the\r\nPresident of the Russian Federation, President Yeltsin, to\r\ndevelop a world concept for the twenty-first century. As a\r\nworld Power and permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil, Russia is fully conscious of its special role in and\r\nresponsibility for world developments and stands for the\r\nestablishment of a multipolar world built on a solid\r\nfoundation of international law. Our country is pursuing in\r\npractice a multifaceted foreign policy with a view to\r\nestablishing equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral and\r\nmultilateral relations with all the countries of the world and\r\nto strengthening international security and stability.\r\nThe world concept for the twenty-first century\r\ninvolves establishing a new culture which would aim to\r\nform a common system of values and models of\r\nbehaviour. A world without wars and conflict, a world of\r\ndemocracy and prosperity must be the highest priority for\r\nall peoples and States. Every nation is entitled to its\r\nrightful place among other nations and to security on an\r\nequal footing in all its aspects, including in the political,\r\nmilitary, economic and social areas.\r\nHow and through what mechanisms can this be\r\nachieved? Is there a body which can reflect the interests\r\nof all States in a balanced manner? The answer is\r\nobvious: it is the United Nations. From the outset, the\r\nUnited Nations Charter put the Organization at the service\r\nof all humankind. There is simply no other universal\r\nmechanism to regulate international relations.\r\nWe are fully aware of the danger posed by the\r\nthreats and challenges facing our world today: the various\r\nmanifestations of militant nationalism, separatism,\r\nterrorism and extremism, which know no borders. This is\r\na common challenge which is claiming countless victims\r\nand wreaking destruction in various parts of the globe.\r\nAggressive separatism, which has become a growth\r\nmedium for various extremist forces, has become one of\r\nthe main sources of domestic conflict and regional\r\ninstability. No one is immune to it. The international\r\ncommunity and, above all, the United Nations, must\r\ndecisively clamp down on any manifestations of\r\nseparatism and strictly and consistently defend the\r\nprinciples of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nStates and the inviolability of their borders. Outside\r\nencouragement and support for separatist forces must be\r\ntotally eradicated.\r\nRecently, separatism has been increasingly merging\r\nwith the monster of terrorism. We could even now, during\r\nthis session, take a number of specific steps to stimulate\r\npractical international cooperation in combating terrorism.\r\nWe must finalize the draft international convention on the\r\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. I therefore\r\nsuggest that we should develop and adopt a declaration of\r\nprinciples for cooperation between States on combating\r\nterrorism more vigorously. It is the States’ bounden duty\r\nto protect their citizens against terrorist attacks and to\r\nprevent activities from taking place in their territory that\r\nare aimed at organizing such acts against the citizens of\r\nother countries. Russia therefore supports the initiative to\r\nconvene, under United Nations auspices, a conference or\r\na special session of the General Assembly next year on\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\ncombating terrorism. Such an event would give a powerful\r\npolitical impetus to the struggle against terrorism at a global\r\nlevel.\r\nThe capabilities of the United Nations should also be\r\nused more efficiently in the fight against drug-related\r\nthreats and organized crime. Only through joint efforts that\r\nare also in strict compliance with the rules of international\r\nlaw can we defeat this evil.\r\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations made\r\nprovision for a law-based response to violations of peace\r\nand security. The international community can take also\r\ncoercive measures, but this should be done in accordance\r\nwith the Charter and following a decision by the Security\r\nCouncil. Unlawful means can only undermine rightful ends.\r\nIt is from this very perspective that we assess such\r\ndoctrines as that of humanitarian intervention. In general,\r\nwe should take an extremely careful approach to coercive\r\nmeasures; what is more, we must not allow them to turn\r\ninto a repressive mechanism for influencing States and\r\npeoples that are not to the liking of some.\r\nOf course, evolution of the international situation\r\nmeans that it is appropriate for existing rules of\r\ninternational law to be developed and adapted to prevailing\r\nconditions, but this should be done through collective\r\ndiscussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions, not as\r\na fait accompli and not working from scratch: it should be\r\nbased on valid rules of international law. This is precisely\r\nwhat Russia had in mind with its initiative to consider at\r\nthe Millennium Summit legal aspects of the use of force in\r\ninternational relations in the era of globalization. We invite\r\nall countries to a broad and open dialogue on this issue.\r\nMuch has been said in recent years about the reform\r\nof the United Nations, which is only natural. Life is an\r\nevolving process and, as times change, any system will\r\nneed to be updated. What objectives future reform should\r\npursue is another matter. In our view, reform means, first\r\nand foremost, the adoption of a package of measures to\r\nenhance the role of the United Nations in the world arena.\r\nThe Organization should be ready to respond in a timely\r\nand appropriate way to the challenges that globalization\r\npresents to mankind. We must give serious thought to how\r\nto enhance the efficiency of the Security Council and how\r\nto make that principal organ of the United Nations more\r\nrepresentative through the inclusion of influential new\r\nmembers, including — and this is absolutely\r\nindispensable — developing countries. This would help\r\nmaintain the overall balance in the system of international\r\nrelations, especially when the use of force, bypassing the\r\nSecurity Council, continues. It is also beyond doubt that\r\npreservation of the right of veto of permanent members\r\nis indispensable for meaningful and efficient work in the\r\nCouncil.\r\nGenerally speaking, the entire system of international\r\norganizations needs sensible and responsible reform. At\r\nthe same time, the United Nations must remain a focal\r\npoint of the international community’s efforts to settle the\r\nmost burning problems of the day. The issue of\r\nstrengthening the authority of the United Nations after it\r\nhas been seriously and painfully tested by the Balkan and\r\nIraq crises is at the very top of the agenda at the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly. First of all, we must\r\ncontinue strenuous efforts to restore the role of the\r\nSecurity Council in world affairs.\r\nWe have managed through joint efforts to bring the\r\nsettlement of the Kosovo problem back within the legal\r\nand political framework of the United Nations. Now we\r\nneed jointly to strive for strict and consistent\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999). We cannot afford to let the re-emerging political\r\nprocess be undermined again, since that could become a\r\ntragedy for all of Europe and could once again bring the\r\nworld to the brink of catastrophe. Equally urgent is the\r\nissue of post-conflict rehabilitation in the Balkans. The\r\nUnited Nations has an important role to play in meeting\r\nthese challenges as well.\r\nWe all should draw serious lessons from recent\r\ncrises. Non-legitimate methods of exerting power only\r\nexacerbate problems and result in even greater deadlock.\r\nDevelopments in the Middle East, where the peace\r\nprocess has of late acquired a new positive impetus,\r\nclearly exemplify the optimal alternative, that of\r\nnegotiated settlement.\r\nAlso on the agenda is the issue of improving\r\nsanctions regimes, to which the international community\r\nhas frequently resorted over the past decade. Sanctions\r\nare an extreme measure. They must be applied only when\r\nother means of political influence have been exhausted\r\nand when the Security Council has established the\r\nexistence of a threat to peace. The Council, for its part,\r\nshould be guided by clear criteria for the imposition and\r\nthe lifting of sanctions, and should not permit any free\r\ninterpretation of the decisions it has adopted, much less\r\npermit the use of its decisions by anyone for selfish\r\npolitical or economic ends. It is necessary to take very\r\nserious account of the humanitarian implications of\r\nsanctions both for the population of the States subject to\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nsuch sanctions and for third countries. The punishment of\r\nentire nations, especially for an indefinite time and\r\nindiscriminately, is inadmissible.\r\nPeacemaking is one of the key areas of United Nations\r\nactivities. During the past 50 years the Organization has\r\nacquired vast practical experience in this field. Having\r\nsuccessfully survived intense disputes and ideological\r\nbattles, peacemaking has proved its vital power and\r\nimportance for securing world and regional stability. The\r\nevolution of the theory and practice of present-day\r\npeacemaking confirms that there is no alternative to\r\nmaintaining the central role of the United Nations in this\r\nsphere. The encouragement of peacemaking and the\r\nstrengthening of its legal basis in strict conformity with the\r\nfundamental principles of the Charter should become an\r\nimportant component of the concept of the world in the\r\ntwenty-first century. Building up and modernizing the anti-\r\ncrisis capability of the United Nations is a key prerequisite\r\nfor tackling these tasks successfully. The top priority here\r\nis to begin truly using the system of stand-by agreements\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nTaking into account the limited resources of the world\r\nOrganization, and given the high demand for peacekeeping\r\noperations, cooperation and division of labour between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional structures has become a\r\npriority. It is of fundamental importance that such\r\ncooperation should be in strict accordance with Chapter\r\nVIII of the Charter and should be fully consistent with the\r\nprerogatives of the Security Council.\r\nFor Russia, the question of peacemaking cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations is\r\nfar from theoretical. For many years, Russian peacemakers\r\nwithin the peacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS) have contributed to stabilizing the\r\nsituations in Abkhazia, Georgia, in Tajikistan, and in Trans-\r\nDniestria, Moldova. This testifies to the fact that the\r\nsettlement of conflicts within the framework of the CIS is\r\na priority for Russia. As before, we do not see any\r\nreasonable alternative to political settlement of these crisis\r\nsituations, for which political will, patience and\r\ncommitment to one’s obligations are needed. We consider\r\nit important for the United Nations to continue to play a\r\nprominent role in finding solutions in Tajikistan and in\r\nAbkhazia, Georgia.\r\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE), which is called upon to play a central role\r\nin ensuring European security and stability, can and should\r\nbe the main United Nations peacemaking partner in Europe.\r\nWhen this arrangement fails to work, not only do specific\r\nEuropean countries suffer, but providing for global and\r\ncontinental security becomes complicated. In a broad\r\nsense, OSCE peacemaking parameters, ranging from\r\nconflict prevention to peacekeeping operations and post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation, should be defined in a charter on\r\nEuropean security. Russia proposes too that the charter\r\nshould also reflect such principles important for the future\r\nof Europeans as ensuring the security and the foundations\r\nof the relations between European and Euro-Atlantic\r\norganizations in this area. Then the charter will indeed\r\nbecome a kind of political constitution for the Europe of\r\nthe twenty-first century. As the Istanbul summit of the\r\nOSCE, which is expected to adopt the charter, is\r\napproaching fast, we should press ahead with the\r\nformulation of a substantive document.\r\nThe Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\r\nbuilding Measures in Asia may become an important\r\nfactor for stability on the Asian continent after the new\r\npositive impetus it received at the recent Almaty Foreign\r\nAffairs Ministers’ Meeting of the founding States. The\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nRegional Forum, a venue for active dialogue on a broad\r\nspectrum of urgent international issues, is yet another\r\nexample of the focus of the Asian countries on the\r\nformation of solid structures for security and cooperation\r\non the continent.\r\nIt is necessary to enhance the potential of African\r\nregional and subregional organizations, which are acting\r\nin close cooperation with the United Nations to curb and\r\ncope with conflicts and humanitarian catastrophes\r\nemerging in Africa. It is the duty of the international\r\ncommunity to render every possible support to the\r\nAfrican peoples.\r\nWhile strengthening the legal and practical basis of\r\npeacemaking activities, special attention should be paid to\r\nwhat is commonly called the human rights dimension.\r\nThis relates not only to measures to minimize human\r\nsufferings caused by armed conflicts, but also to efforts\r\naimed at preventing humanitarian crises.\r\nIn this connection, I cannot fail to mention the\r\nunacceptable situation of countless thousands of people in\r\nthe centre of Europe who, due to arbitrary actions by\r\nauthorities, have found themselves deprived of their\r\ncitizenship and of the right to use their native language\r\nand enjoy full rights in their State of residence. Civilized\r\nintegration, rather than latent assimilation — this is the\r\nway out of the prevailing humanitarian situation in these\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\ncountries. We welcome the efforts of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council\r\nof Europe and the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS)\r\naimed at eliminating violations of human rights and\r\nfreedoms of the non-indigenous population of Latvia and\r\nEstonia. We hope that the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights will make her contribution\r\nto these efforts.\r\nThe risk of losing positive dynamics in the sphere of\r\ndisarmament as a result of attempts to rely on unilateral\r\npower methods cannot but cause concern. If the political\r\nand legal fabric regulating international relations continues\r\nto disintegrate further, then trends to ensure national\r\nsecurity through an arms race will become even stronger.\r\nRussia has consistently advocated the reduction and\r\nlimitation of nuclear arsenals and strict compliance with the\r\nnon-proliferation regime. For without this, ensuring\r\nstrategic stability would prove impossible.\r\nWe realize the importance of early ratification of the\r\nSTART II Treaty and of the initiation of START III\r\nnegotiations, under which Russia would be prepared, on a\r\nreciprocal basis, to agree to considerable further reduction\r\nof strategic offensive armaments. Naturally, this process\r\nwill be feasible only if the existing agreements in this field,\r\nfirst of all the ABM Treaty, are strictly observed. We\r\nbelieve that the General Assembly should come out clearly\r\nin support of the preservation and observance of the ABM\r\nTreaty, which is a cornerstone of strategic stability, because\r\nunilateral actions aimed at undermining the time-tested\r\nregime established by this Treaty are fraught with\r\nextremely dangerous consequences. A collective search for\r\npolitical and diplomatic solutions is the alternative to\r\nmilitary responses to the problems of proliferation. This is\r\nprecisely the target of Russia’s initiative concerning the\r\nglobal system of control over proliferation of missiles and\r\nmissile technologies.\r\nSubstantive discussions on threats to international\r\ninformation security must also be continued within the\r\nframework and under the auspices of the United Nations.\r\nThe time has come to reach, through joint efforts, a\r\ncommon understanding of such threats and of measures to\r\nreduce them.\r\nThe twentieth century has brought about economic\r\nglobalization. All economies have become open and closely\r\nlinked as a result of advances in science and technology.\r\nAll these factors have provided a powerful impetus to\r\nsocial and economic development while creating their own\r\nspecific problems. The gap between the industrial and the\r\nformerly colonial worlds has not only persisted but has\r\nbegun to widen. Development assistance should remain a\r\nprincipal focus of future United Nations activities. Crises,\r\nprimarily financial ones, have assumed an international\r\ncharacter. We must draw the appropriate lessons and\r\nmodernize the architecture of the world financial system.\r\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies should\r\nplay a role here.\r\nThe expansion of human economic activities has\r\nbrought about a globalization of both natural and\r\nman-made disasters, and this has become a major\r\ndestabilizing global factor. The challenges related to the\r\nprevention of such disasters and the elimination of their\r\nconsequences require that the most advanced technologies\r\nbe used for the benefit of the world community as a\r\nwhole. Why not consider, therefore, the establishment,\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, of a specialized\r\ninternational emergency agency which would assume\r\nrelevant functions?\r\nA widely known saying reads: \"It is much easier to\r\nwin a war than a peace.\" The United Nations founders\r\nwon the war and laid the foundations for peace. It is our\r\nduty to win this peace and to make it comprehensive and\r\nirreversible.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs of Ghana, His Excellency Mr. James\r\nVictor Gbeho.\r\nMr. Gbeho (Ghana): Mr. President, I am pleased to\r\njoin previous speakers in congratulating you and the other\r\nmembers of the Bureau on your election to guide the\r\nwork of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.\r\nGiven your vast diplomatic experience and personal\r\nattachment to the principles of the Charter, I have every\r\nhope that our deliberations under your guidance will be\r\nable to determine the necessary mechanisms for dealing\r\nwith the numerous challenges facing our Organization as\r\nwe move into the next century.\r\nI also wish to express the deep sense of gratitude of\r\nmy delegation to your predecessor, His Excellency Didier\r\nOpertti, who served with great distinction in the year\r\nwhich marked the implementation of reforms instituted by\r\nthe Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, to mould the\r\nOrganization into a tool that can better fulfil the needs of\r\nMember States.\r\nAs we enter a new century, our Organization must\r\nmake a realistic assessment of developments in the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nout-going century, especially in this last decade. Such an\r\nassessment will indicate that while global peace and\r\nsecurity have been pursued relentlessly, they have not been\r\neasily nor fully achieved. The reasons are not hard to find.\r\nThe situation is aggravated by the multiplicity of\r\nconflicts that pervades the world, especially in Africa.\r\nIntrastate conflicts, rooted in ethnic, racial and religious\r\nintolerance, pose a threat to the security and stability of\r\nmany States and regions. While we welcome the\r\nagreements to end the conflict in Sierra Leone and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, the prolonged hostilities in\r\nAngola, Somalia, and lately in Kosovo, demonstrate that the\r\ninternational community is still grappling with serious\r\nchallenges to peace and security.\r\nIn spite of such setbacks and disappointments, we\r\nmust continue to maintain trust and confidence in the\r\nUnited Nations ability to achieve sustainable\r\nsocio-economic development for Member States. But that\r\nconfidence will be sustained only when the Organization is\r\nseen to be truly seeking the interest of all Member States,\r\nwithout exception. In this regard, Member States must give\r\nimpetus to the reform process that we initiated a decade\r\nago and maintain its dynamism. We also must accept that\r\nthe core of the reform touches on the Security Council,\r\nwhose decisions bind all Members of the Organization.\r\nThe Security Council must therefore not be allowed to\r\nbecome irrelevant. It should be reformed to ensure that it\r\ncan undertake its responsibilities more effectively under the\r\nCharter. And this reform must be guided by the principles\r\nof democracy, sovereign equality of States and equitable\r\ngeographical representation. In this connection, we wholly\r\nsubscribe to the Non-Aligned Movement’s statement on all\r\naspects of the question of increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, complemented by the African position as\r\nexpressed in the Harare declaration of June 1997. Africa’s\r\nclaim to at least two permanent seats should be adequately\r\naddressed, since Africa is the largest regional group in the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe would also like to reiterate the proposal of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement that a periodic review of the\r\nstructure and functioning of the Security Council is\r\nnecessary in order to ensure at all times that it responds\r\nmore effectively to new challenges in international\r\nrelations, especially in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIt is only through a restructuring of the Council on\r\nthese lines that this body can avoid selectivity in dealing\r\nwith issues of international peace and security and\r\nsustainable development. The present unequal handling of\r\nthe causes and management of conflicts is unacceptable\r\nsince it indirectly allows some conflicts to drag on.\r\nMy delegation believes that we can succeed in our\r\ncollective effort to achieve peace and prosperity in the\r\nnext century if we begin to speak out boldly against some\r\nof the injustices on the international scene. We therefore\r\nreiterate our concern over the continued non-compliance\r\nwith key United Nations resolutions that call for an end\r\nto the commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. It\r\nis our sincere conviction that the economic blockade of\r\nmore than three decades’ vintage against Cuba and the\r\nHelms-Burton and D’Amato legislation are a breach of\r\ninternational law and a violation of the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nParticularly, Ghana considers the extraterritorial\r\neffect of the Helms-Burton and D’Amato legislation an\r\ninfringement on the territorial integrity of States and an\r\nimpediment to international navigation and free trade. In\r\nthis regard, we are concerned that the economic blockade\r\ncontinues to severely aggravate the plight of Cubans,\r\nespecially the vulnerable groups such as women, children\r\nand the elderly.\r\nGiven the United States Government’s recent\r\nsensitivity to the concerns of the international community,\r\nGhana would like to urge it to seriously consider the\r\nresumption of indirect relations with Cuba. We are\r\nconvinced that such contacts will yield desired results,\r\nespecially if they take place in the context of constructive\r\ndialogue with the Cuban Government.\r\nAnother area of concern to the international\r\ncommunity has been the lingering disagreements with the\r\ngreat Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. My delegation welcomes\r\nthe positive events of 5 April 1999, by which the two\r\nLibyan nationals arrived in the Netherlands for trial by a\r\nScottish court, in connection with the Lockerbie incident.\r\nWe therefore can do no less than to reiterate the position\r\nof the Group of African States at the United Nations, the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, and the Council of the League\r\nof Arab States that, as a matter of urgency, the Security\r\nCouncil should move beyond a mere suspension to a\r\ncomplete lifting of the sanctions imposed against the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, since Libya has cooperated fully\r\nand fulfilled all the requirements of the relevant\r\nresolutions.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nNo issue in recent memory has frustrated the\r\ninternational community more than the Middle East peace\r\nprocess. Last year, as the world marked the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the forcible dispossession of the Palestinian\r\npeople of their lands, homes and property, the Wye River\r\nMemorandum was agreed, offering a fresh impetus and\r\nhope for progress. However, subsequent events —\r\ncharacterized by prevarications, recriminations and bad\r\nfaith — inhibited full implementation of the Memorandum.\r\nEven more painful has been the seeming helplessness of the\r\ninternational community in the face of such obvious\r\ninjustice.\r\nGhana reiterates its unwavering support for the\r\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to the\r\nestablishment of an independent sovereign State with\r\nJerusalem as its capital. Happily, recent changes in the\r\npolitical landscape of Israel offer grounds for renewed\r\noptimism. We thus share the conviction of the Palestinian\r\nleader, Chairman Yasser Arafat, that Mr. Ehud Barak’s\r\nvictory has raised hopes for peace throughout the region.\r\nWe commend the bold initiative taken by the Israeli leader,\r\nsoon after assuming office, to resume dialogue and reach a\r\nmeeting of minds with the Palestinians. The challenge\r\nahead is enormous but not insurmountable; it will require\r\npainful compromises on sensitive issues. We urge all parties\r\nto negotiate in good faith towards a comprehensive, just\r\nand lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nGhana is proud of its participation and record in the\r\npeacekeeping efforts of the Organization in all regions of\r\nthe world. The sacrifices in material resources and the costs\r\nin human terms have not been in vain, since the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding have been critical in assuring all of us of the\r\nglobal tranquillity necessary for sustained development.\r\nMy delegation believes therefore that the time has\r\ncome for the international community to do in Africa as\r\nmuch as it has done in other areas, particularly the Balkans,\r\nto guarantee peace. We have seen in the past few months\r\nthe kind of resources that the world has been willing and\r\nable to mobilize in the Balkans on short notice. We do not\r\nsee the same response to the tragedies of Africa. African\r\nMember States feel discriminated against when the response\r\nof the international community to conflicts on the continent\r\ncontinues to be muted or lukewarm.\r\nNuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction are indispensable for the preservation\r\nof world peace. Yet the lack of commitment and political\r\nwill of the nuclear weapon countries continues to impede\r\nthe process of nuclear disarmament. This is demonstrated\r\nby the failure of the three Preparatory Committee sessions\r\nfor the 2000 Review Conference for the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nAgainst this background, my delegation reiterates the\r\nwarning that the parties and non-parties to the NPT alike\r\nwill not continue indefinitely to abide by the Treaty while\r\nthe nuclear-weapon countries continue to ignore the calls\r\nof the international community to abide by their NPT\r\ncommitments and pursue negotiations in good faith on\r\neffective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear\r\narms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament\r\nunder strict and effective international control.\r\nThe proliferation of conventional weapons, notably\r\nsmall and light weapons, is equally of concern, since they\r\nare the tools of violence and conflict in Africa. My\r\ndelegation commends all the efforts aimed at securing\r\ninternational cooperation and coordination in the struggle\r\nagainst the accumulation, proliferation and widespread use\r\nof small arms. Naturally, we welcome the recent decision\r\ntaken on small arms and light weapons by the heads of\r\nState of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at their\r\nrecent summit in Algiers which, among others, called on\r\nOAU member States to adopt a coordinated approach to\r\nthe problems posed by the illicit trafficking, circulation\r\nand proliferation of these arms.\r\nWe also urge all friends of Africa to support the\r\nimplementation of the moratorium on the import, export\r\nand manufacture of small arms and light weapons in West\r\nAfrica, which aims at stemming the illicit traffic in these\r\nweapons in our subregion. My Government, in\r\nrecognition of the need to address this problem and the\r\nrelated issue of the forced participation of children in\r\narmed conflicts, intends to jointly host with the\r\nGovernment of Canada a workshop aimed at building on\r\nthe Mali moratorium and establishing a framework for\r\nkeeping children out of conflicts. It is our hope that the\r\nsupport of the international community will be\r\nforthcoming when the time comes.\r\nWe are at the dawn of the new millennium,\r\nconcluding a period in which the decolonization\r\nmovement has brought about one of the century’s signal\r\ntransformations: that of more than 80 nations from\r\ncolonial status to self-rule and membership of this\r\nOrganization. This is a commendable achievement.\r\nNevertheless, the goal of the Plan of Action for the\r\nInternational Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism\r\nhas not been realized, since 17 Non-Self-Governing\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nTerritories remain on the agenda of this Assembly. We\r\nreiterate our continued belief in the right of all peoples to\r\nself-determination in accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 1514 (XV) and call on the administering,\r\noccupying or colonial Powers to cooperate with the relevant\r\ninstitutions of the United Nations for the speedy\r\ndetermination of self-rule.\r\nWhile we congratulate the United Nations and\r\nourselves for the commendable record in bringing colonies\r\nto self-rule, we cannot hide our deep disappointment at the\r\nrecent turn of events in East Timor. Since a significant\r\nnumber of States Members of the United Nations are the\r\nproduct of self-determination, our Organization has a moral\r\nand political obligation to bring East Timor to self-rule.\r\nWe call on both the United Nations and the administering\r\nPower, therefore, to take all measures necessary to restore\r\npeace and tranquility so that the true wishes of the people,\r\nas clearly expressed in the recent referendum, can be\r\nrespected without further delay.\r\nIf we are concerned about subjugated territories, then\r\nwe cannot remain silent over the continued plight of\r\nWestern Sahara. The people of that territory must exercise\r\ntrue self-determination and we believe that, since the\r\nPolisario Front and Morocco have accepted the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s programme on implementation of the Settlement\r\nPlan for the referendum in the territory, then the promised\r\nreferendum should be held without further delay. We call\r\non all stakeholders to demonstrate good will and fairness by\r\nensuring a free and fair referendum.\r\nThe phenomenon of extreme and widespread poverty\r\nin the midst of plenty in the world is a serious indictment\r\nof the conscience and political will of the international\r\ncommunity. Compared to the social situation at the onset of\r\nthis century, the next century begins with an even bleaker\r\noutlook. More and more people are living at or below the\r\npoverty line, while individual security and well-being\r\ncontinue to face disruptions from civil conflict and disease.\r\nMalnutrition, malaria, AIDS, diarrheal and communicable\r\ndiseases continue to kill millions of people, stifling the\r\neconomic potential of large segments of populations.\r\nHIV/AIDS alone has killed in the last decade more\r\nAfricans than have all the conflicts and other diseases. It is\r\na frightening thought that millions of Africa’s young and\r\nproductive populations will be killed by this pandemic in\r\nthe next few years. What development and progress are we\r\ntalking about, then, if we will have no human resource to\r\nimplement them?\r\nThe continued deterioration of economic conditions\r\nin Africa poses a challenge to all of us, especially as all\r\nstatistics show that the world’s poor continue to wallow\r\nin abject poverty with only a dim hope of improvement\r\nin their living standards. One of the main requirements of\r\nour current session of the General Assembly is therefore\r\nto select for implementation those measures that will\r\nenable developing countries to grow out of poverty in a\r\nsustainable environment.\r\nMy delegation continues to be concerned about the\r\ndeterioration of official development assistance, even\r\nthough we note with gratitude the decision by three\r\nindustrialized countries to increase their gross national\r\nproduct allocation to aid, and the steadfastness of\r\nDenmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, which\r\nare providing more than 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\nnational product. Official development assistance\r\nresources need to be increased to levels which, combined\r\nwith the commitment of developing countries to\r\ndeepening economic reforms, lead to early achievement\r\nof sustainability in growth, poverty reduction and\r\nmacroeconomic stability.\r\nIf we must break the cycle of crises, poverty and\r\ninstability, particularly in Africa, and if we must create\r\nthe conditions for sustainable debt management on the\r\ncontinent, the creditor countries and institutions must be\r\nprepared to wipe out the debts of the countries involved\r\nin the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)\r\nInitiative and begin the new millennium on a clean slate.\r\nIn this connection, we note with appreciation the\r\nrecently announced decision and support of the G-7\r\ncountries in broadening, deepening and accelerating the\r\nHIPC Initiative. While we express our satisfaction, let me\r\nhasten to urge that care be taken to avoid the imposition\r\nof additional difficulties on HIPC countries in the process,\r\nsuch as are likely to befall HIPC gold-producing countries\r\nif the proposal to sell off some of the gold reserves of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to meet part of the\r\ncost of the expanded HIPC Initiative is followed through.\r\nSimilarly, we pray all creditor countries not to present\r\ndebt relief in conditionalities that would compel debtor\r\ncountries to give up the relief option.\r\nIn these days of globalization and trade\r\nliberalization, the developed countries must also open\r\ntheir markets to goods from developing countries,\r\nincluding providing greater access for the latter’s\r\nagricultural produce and services. The developed countries\r\nmust, in addition, implement their trade obligations in the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nspirit that all must benefit from the trade rules. In this\r\nregard, the twin concepts of liberalization and globalization\r\nmust afford developing countries economic justice in terms\r\nof markets and activities. They should not turn developing\r\ncountries into perpetual consumers because of limited\r\nvolume of goods and market access.\r\nAs we approach the next century, we know we cannot\r\nbuild the kind of future we desire without the full\r\nparticipation of women. Although much has been achieved\r\nin advancing the status of women through the\r\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, a lot\r\nstill remains to be done. Discrimination, denial and violence\r\nagainst women and girls persist, embedded in cultural,\r\ntraditional and religious practices around the world, despite\r\nthe increasing public debate on gender issues.\r\nGender mainstreaming into national, regional and\r\ninternational policies and programmes, as well as the\r\nprovision of adequate resources for implementation as spelt\r\nout in the Beijing Platform for Action, represents one of the\r\ncrucial strategies for attaining gender equity and equality.\r\nBut in the final analysis, the critical step in protecting\r\nwomen’s rights is to empower women through education\r\nand increased awareness of their rights. In this connection,\r\nlet me express my delegation’s appreciation for the\r\nadoption of an optional protocol to the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\r\nWomen (CEDAW) which, among others, recognizes the\r\ncompetence of CEDAW to receive and consider\r\ncommunications submitted by or on behalf of individuals or\r\ngroups of individuals, under the jurisdiction of a State\r\nParty, claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the\r\nrights set forth in the Convention by the State Party. We\r\nare happy that after so many years, women now have an\r\neffective instrument in their hands to fight discrimination,\r\nand we urge the adoption of the draft optional protocol to\r\nthe Convention.\r\nThis year, we also commemorate the tenth anniversary\r\nof the adoption by this Assembly of the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child, by which all Member States pledged to\r\npromote and protect the rights of children. Despite the\r\nConvention, however, the rights of children continue to be\r\nviolated through child labour, commercial sex, exploitation,\r\nearly marriage and the use of children in armed conflicts.\r\nThis situation indicates that mere ratification of the\r\nConvention is not enough. Children would be protected and\r\ntheir rights promoted only by a conscious effort on the part\r\nof Governments to effectively implement the provisions of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nThe United Nations and other international\r\norganizations are justifiably preoccupied with governance\r\nbecause it is the basis of all progress. The United Nations\r\nmust therefore play a fundamental and central role in the\r\nre-design of global governance and in global governance\r\nitself. It cannot do so, however, when it is constantly\r\nrequested to do more for all people while it is being given\r\nless and less resources. It will certainly lack the\r\ninstitutional framework for global leadership when\r\nnational leaders fail to stand up for it or its enduring\r\nvalues. Given the onerous responsibilities of the\r\nOrganization and the expectations of the Member States,\r\nthe timely, full and unconditional payment of assessed\r\ncontributions would be an expression of our commitment\r\nand support as the Organization prepares to meet the\r\nemerging challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nIn this connection, it is our firm conviction that the\r\nregular and peacekeeping budgets of the Organization\r\nshould be determined solely by the General Assembly in\r\naccordance with each country’s ability to pay, among\r\nother factors, as objectively evaluated within the\r\nOrganization. Unilateral decisions that worsen the\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations must be avoided.\r\nWe have an opportunity to draw lessons from our\r\nimmediate past history and to shape a new millennium in\r\nour best image, just as the great statesmen of this century\r\ndid in the aftermath of the Second World War. We would\r\nnot be true to ourselves if we sought refuge in half\r\nmeasures. We must use our best endeavours to build a\r\nnew world for a new millennium we can be proud of. Our\r\ncollective wisdom demands this. Our civilized values\r\ninsist on this. We can do no less.\r\nThe President: I call on Her Excellency Ms. Tarja\r\nHalonen, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland, who\r\nwill speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nMs. Halonen (Finland): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union.\r\nMr. President, I would like to congratulate you upon\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly. The\r\nEuropean Union gives you its full support and\r\ncooperation throughout this session. Your predecessor,\r\nMinister Opertti, also deserves our appreciation. I would\r\nalso commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nthe skill with which he has steered this Organization. The\r\nEuropean Union pledges its support also to him, as well\r\nas its full commitment to the United Nations.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nI should like to welcome the three new members of\r\nthe United Nations, the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru\r\nand the Kingdom of Tonga, into our global family.\r\nIn overall terms substantial progress has been made in\r\nhuman development. However, its speed and extent have\r\nbeen uneven. The United Nations has a primary role in the\r\nadvancement of human development. Implementation can\r\nbe carried out only through close cooperation among\r\ndifferent actors: the United Nations, its Member States, its\r\nspecialized agencies, international financial institutions,\r\nregional organizations and civil society.\r\nWe need an efficient and effective United Nations\r\nwhich has a stable financial basis and a full commitment\r\nfrom all its Member States. This also means the full,\r\nprompt and unconditional payment of contributions to the\r\nUnited Nations by all. Unilateral decisions and actions to\r\nthe contrary are not allowed.\r\nThe globalization of the world economy is an\r\nunavoidable process. We see the need to put the\r\nglobalization process and macroeconomic policies in closer\r\ntouch with the lives of ordinary people. We consider this to\r\nbe one of the challenges facing the world community on the\r\nthreshold of the new millennium. The United Nations is\r\nuniquely positioned to provide intellectual leadership to\r\nensure that the advantages of economic globalization are\r\nequally shared by the world’s population. Increasing\r\ninterdependence must work for people.\r\nThe nature of crises has also changed. Most of today’s\r\nconflicts take place within and not between States. We face\r\nsituations where there are serious democracy deficiencies\r\nand where human rights are strongly violated, in particular\r\nthe rights of the minorities. In the worst cases, States with\r\ntheir traditional institutions have ceased to exist, as\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan described so well in his\r\nopening statement.\r\nAt the threshold of a new millennium, we should\r\nintensify our efforts to prevent these situations. We should\r\nstart to consider how to elaborate some criteria and rules\r\naimed at the prevention of humanitarian catastrophes or\r\nalleviation of profound human suffering.\r\nThe international community needs to develop\r\nsolutions and responses to these new and unexpected\r\nchallenges. The international community must play a\r\nproactive role in conflict prevention. There are several\r\nforms of action that have a useful effect in preventing\r\nconflicts. These include strengthening democracy and\r\nrespect for human rights, as well as progress in economic\r\nand social development through good governance. The\r\nmost important factor in conflict prevention is, however,\r\na democratic society which is on a steady foundation and\r\nwhich guarantees human security in its widest possible\r\nsense. Democratic societies do not go to war with each\r\nother, and they are also internally more stable.\r\nEvery human being is entitled to enjoy his or her\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Human rights\r\nare essential in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, economic development and social equality. The\r\nUnited Nations has a primary role in the promotion of\r\nuniversal respect for human rights. These must be further\r\nintegrated in all United Nations activities. The promotion\r\nof universal respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms is central also to the activities of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of the adoption of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child reminds us of the\r\nneed to advance the rights of the most vulnerable:\r\nchildren. The European Union welcomes the recent\r\nadoption of the International Labour Organization (ILO)\r\nConvention on the prohibition and elimination of the\r\nworst forms of child labour. All States should ratify the\r\nConvention as soon as possible and implement it\r\neffectively. The protection of children affected by armed\r\nconflicts also requires constant attention. It is imperative\r\nto adopt without delay the optional protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, on involvement of\r\nchildren in armed conflict.\r\nThe European Union is concerned about\r\ndiscrimination against women. We underline the\r\nimportance of the international human rights instruments\r\ndesigned to protect and promote the human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms of women. The adoption of the\r\noptional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of\r\nAll Forms of Discrimination against Women will be a\r\nhistoric event in this session. The European Union calls\r\non all States to give serious consideration to ratifying it.\r\nTrafficking in human beings violates many of the\r\nmost basic human rights. Most victims of this practice are\r\nwomen and children. Concerted international action is\r\nrequired in the fight against trafficking. The European\r\nUnion supports the work done to develop international\r\nstandards to prevent these crimes and to punish the\r\nperpetrators. Measures must also be taken to help the\r\nvictims of this type of exploitation.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nRacism is a universal problem. Thus, the elimination\r\nof all forms of racial intolerance should be the\r\nresponsibility of every State. We also want to underline the\r\ninput by civil society and non-governmental organizations\r\nin this field.\r\nThe European Union is committed to opposing the\r\ndeath penalty. We call on all States that still impose the\r\ndeath penalty to progressively restrict the offences for\r\nwhich it may be used, and we insist that it be carried out\r\naccording to minimum standards. As a first step, a\r\nmoratorium on executions should be established. The final\r\naim must remain the complete abolition of the death\r\npenalty. The European Union will actively pursue this\r\nmatter in this session.\r\nNo doubt, sustainable development in all areas\r\nenhances crisis prevention. People are at the centre of our\r\nconcerns in sustainable development.\r\nThe Buenos Aires Plan of Action sets out an ambitious\r\nand precise timetable to follow in future negotiations on the\r\nthreat of climate change. However, there are still important\r\noutstanding questions, such as the Kyoto mechanisms and\r\ncapacity-building of developing countries, as well as the\r\ntransfer of technology. In the Intergovernmental Forum on\r\nForests, our common goal is to promote sustainable forest\r\nmanagement worldwide. The European Union also notes the\r\nneed for international coordination on oceans and seas.\r\nThe European Union is fully committed to reducing\r\nextreme poverty in developing countries. We support them\r\nin their efforts to implement the international commitments\r\nfor sustainable development. International cooperation, as\r\nwell as ownership by partner countries, is needed to achieve\r\nthe common goals.\r\nRelieving the unsustainable debt burden of the poorest\r\ncountries requires faster relief through the programme for\r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. The European Union\r\nconfirms its full commitment to the high-level discussion\r\non financing for development. We expect this process to\r\nincrease the political will to implement internationally\r\nagreed strategies for sustainable development.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) remains a cornerstone of global security.\r\nIt is imperative that the four States that have not yet done\r\nso join the NPT. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT) is a key instrument in the field of nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. As we are approaching\r\nthe Conference on the CTBT to be held in October, the\r\nEuropean Union calls upon all States to sign and ratify\r\nthe Treaty.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the entry into force\r\nof the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction. As the international\r\ncommunity moves towards the total elimination of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines worldwide, the recent use of these\r\nweapons is highly deplorable. We must voice concern\r\nabout the misery that anti-personnel mines continue to\r\ncause to the civilian population. The European Union\r\ncontinues to be the main contributor to demining\r\nprogrammes worldwide.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the impact,\r\naccumulation and spread of small arms and light\r\nweapons, and we have intensified our efforts to address\r\nthis problem. The United Nations conference on the illicit\r\narms trade in all its aspects should establish a strong\r\nprogramme of action for international cooperation.\r\nTerrorism constitutes a threat to internal and\r\ninternational security. Therefore, the European Union\r\nreaffirms its unreserved condemnation of terrorism in all\r\nits forms and continues to support initiatives to suppress\r\nit. We call upon all countries to sign and to ratify the\r\ninternational anti-terrorism conventions. We hope that the\r\nconventions on the suppression of terrorist financing and\r\non the acts of nuclear terrorism can be adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly by the end of this year. The European\r\nUnion will look carefully into the proposal of Egypt and\r\nothers to develop further the idea of a United Nations\r\nconference on terrorism.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has said, it would be the\r\nultimate crime to miss the chance for peace and condemn\r\npeople to the misery of war. Even the best plans for\r\nprevention can fail, and the international community has\r\nto address armed conflicts. These conflicts have human,\r\nsocial and environmental consequences which cannot be\r\nrepaired.\r\nThe international community has a long tradition of\r\nsolving crises by peacekeeping operations. Now that the\r\nnature of crises has changed, additional means are needed.\r\nPeacekeeping operations cannot meet all the requirements\r\nwithout increased efforts for civilian crisis management.\r\nIn most crises, societies and their structures are\r\ncompletely destroyed.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nThe international community has called for repair and\r\nrehabilitation. Humanitarian assistance alone is not enough.\r\nReconstruction of societies requires the presence of civilian\r\npolice and other administrators from all fields of civil\r\nactivity. In most cases it is difficult to find the right tools\r\nto cope with conflicts.\r\nThe European Union strongly emphasizes civilian\r\ncrisis management. We hope that it will be more often\r\nresorted to as the principal means to manage and solve\r\ncrises. We will work actively to develop further this\r\nconcept. The European Union is in the process of\r\nimproving its crisis management capabilities, keeping in\r\nmind that the primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security lies with the United Nations\r\nand the Security Council.\r\nRegional organizations have a key role in international\r\nsecurity. For their success, cooperation with the United\r\nNations is essential. The European Union thanks the\r\nSecretary-General for his efforts to strengthen this\r\ncooperation and urges him to continue this work.\r\nThe crisis in Kosovo requires concerted efforts. The\r\nEuropean Union supports the full implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999). With the adoption\r\nof this resolution, the United Nations regained its relevance\r\nas far as Kosovo is concerned. We also support the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\r\n(UNMIK) and KFOR in their efforts to ensure peace,\r\ndemocracy and security in Kosovo. The United Nations\r\nneeds the means and cooperation of all to fulfil its mandate.\r\nAt the height of the Kosovo crisis the European Union\r\nlaunched the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Its\r\naim is to address the questions of democracy, human rights,\r\neconomic reconstruction and security in a comprehensive\r\nand durable manner. We would welcome the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia joining the Stability Pact as a full\r\nand equal participant and beneficiary. The current regime\r\nof Mr. Milosevic is responsible for its present isolation, and\r\nwe look forward to welcoming democratic change inside\r\nSerbia. Meanwhile, we are searching for ways in which\r\nKosovo and the Republic of Montenegro could be made\r\nbeneficiaries of the Pact.\r\nIn Kosovo there is an urgent need to put an end to\r\nhuman suffering. We are concerned about the violence\r\ntowards minorities, which has resulted in a large number of\r\nSerbs and Roma people leaving Kosovo. Urgent restoration\r\nof the rule of law is extremely important.\r\nThe Middle East remains a top priority for the\r\ncommon foreign and security policy of the European\r\nUnion. We find it encouraging that the Middle East peace\r\nprocess has regained momentum and that the negotiations\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians have started again.\r\nNegotiations are the only way to find a just and lasting\r\nsolution to this conflict. We welcome the signing of the\r\nmemorandum on the implementation of the Wye River\r\nAgreement. The European Union has consistently assured\r\nthe parties of its readiness to assist them in their search\r\nfor peace.\r\nAll tracks of the peace process should now be\r\nactivated. We urge the Syrian, Lebanese and Israeli\r\nGovernments to engage in direct talks. The relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions form an internationally\r\naccepted basis for peace.\r\nIt is also important to make progress on the\r\nmultilateral track. Peace can, and must be, rooted in close\r\nregional cooperation. The multilateral track and the\r\nBarcelona process provide good opportunities in this\r\nregard.\r\nThe European Union warmly welcomes the result of\r\nthe popular consultation of the East Timorese people on\r\n30 August 1999. Indonesia’s commitment to the full\r\nimplementation of the relevant Agreements is imperative.\r\nWe are committed to seeing the people of East Timor\r\nenjoy the independence which they have freely chosen.\r\nThe European Union pays tribute to the United Nations\r\nfor the organization of the popular consultation and lauds\r\nthe courage and extraordinary work of the personnel of\r\nthe United Nations Mission in East Timor.\r\nWe condemn in the strongest terms the atrocities in\r\nEast Timor. The Government of Indonesia retains a\r\nresponsibility for security in the Territory.\r\nWe fully support Security Council resolution 1264\r\n(1999) and welcome the early deployment of the\r\nmultinational force. We also welcome the participation of\r\nAsian States in this force. Order, security and the rule of\r\nlaw must be restored immediately. The attitude of the\r\nEuropean Union towards Indonesia will depend on the\r\nimplementation of the undertakings given by the President\r\nof Indonesia. They should be implemented without delay\r\nand without conditions.\r\nWe have agreed, for a period of four months, on an\r\nembargo on the export of military equipment and other\r\nequipment which might be used for internal repression or\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nterrorism. The European Union has also suspended its\r\nbilateral military cooperation with Indonesia.\r\nThe European Union stresses the urgent priority to\r\nremedy the grave humanitarian situation. We will provide\r\nfurther humanitarian assistance to those in need.\r\nWe also support the call of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to convene a special\r\nsession of the Commission on Human Rights. We call for\r\nan investigative mission by the Commission.\r\nEast Timor’s independence must proceed without\r\ndelay, as provided for in the 5 May Agreements. The\r\nMember States of the European Union look forward to\r\nrecognizing East Timor once the process towards\r\nindependence is completed.\r\nWe also emphasize our desire to see a strong,\r\ndemocratic and united Indonesia.\r\nThe European Union continues to fully support the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General towards a negotiated\r\npolitical settlement of the question of Cyprus. We urge the\r\ntwo leaders concerned to accept the invitation to\r\nnegotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General has said that the United Nations\r\ncannot rest until all of Africa is at peace. One third of\r\nsub-Saharan Africa is presently involved in armed conflicts.\r\nThe victims of these conflicts are overwhelmingly civilians.\r\nThe European Union strongly appeals to the parties in these\r\nand other ongoing conflicts to respect human rights and to\r\ncooperate with the humanitarian organizations. We will\r\ncontinue to make all efforts to provide assistance to the\r\nvictims.\r\nConcrete measures have been taken to strengthen\r\nAfrican ownership and capacity to focus on conflict\r\nprevention and resolution. The European Union is\r\nsupporting, in close cooperation with the United Nations,\r\nthe capacity of African organizations in the field of conflict\r\nresolution and peacekeeping.\r\nA stable and democratic political environment is\r\nindispensable for sustainable development. The EU\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa, and we look forward to its effective\r\nfollow-up.\r\nThe first EU-Africa summit is scheduled to take\r\nplace in April 2000. This summit is a clear signal of the\r\nclose cooperation between the EU and the African\r\ncountries aimed at addressing various, even delicate,\r\npolitical and socio-economic issues.\r\nOne of the principal objectives of the Amsterdam\r\nTreaty is to strengthen the EU’s Common Foreign and\r\nSecurity Policy. To achieve this we have created new\r\nunits and instruments to deal with the increasing\r\nchallenges in the field of foreign policy. In accordance\r\nwith the Amsterdam Treaty, we are going to consistently\r\nimprove our capacity for conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement. The EU will increase its ability to contribute\r\nto international peace and security, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\r\nFinally, I should like to say a few words about the\r\nnext millennium. The Millennium Assembly should give\r\nnew direction to the renewal of the United Nations. The\r\nEU supports the overall theme “The United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century”, proposed by the Secretary-General.\r\nIn the view of the EU, the focus should be on poverty\r\neradication in the context of globalization.\r\nPoverty eradication is a major challenge for the\r\ninternational community now that the world’s population\r\nis reaching six billion, with nearly a quarter of that\r\nnumber still living in poverty. It is one of the greatest\r\nchallenges left pending at the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nWith the new millennium, we should also recognize\r\nthe increased importance of civil society in the search for\r\nsolutions. This is one of the cornerstones of the new era in\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
