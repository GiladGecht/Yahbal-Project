(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nEarthquake in China\r\nThe President: I wish to convey to members of the\r\nAssembly that I have learned with shock and sadness of the\r\nearthquake that struck near Taipei yesterday. May I, on\r\nbehalf of the members of the Assembly and on my own\r\nbehalf extend to the people of the Taiwan Province of\r\nChina our heartfelt sympathy at this time of trial.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Chávez Frías, President of the Republic of\r\nVenezuela, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Venezuela, His Excellency Mr.\r\nHugo Chávez Frías, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Chávez Frías (spoke in Spanish): First, I\r\nwish to express my very great pleasure at speaking for the\r\nfirst time in this world forum as head of State and at\r\ngreeting its members on behalf of the people of Venezuela\r\nand my Government, and particularly at speaking at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly, the last of this century\r\nand millennium, which, for us, adds special meaning to\r\nthe event.\r\nMy presence here also affords me an opportunity to\r\nexpress some ideas on the times and circumstances in\r\nwhich we are now living, all of us worldwide but also,\r\nand a little more specifically, about times and\r\ncircumstances in my own country. These are times and\r\ncircumstances, Mr. President and members, which of\r\ncourse we share with you.\r\nA few years ago, when the Berlin Wall fell, I think\r\nsomeone said that peace had broken out. I truly believe\r\nthat that expression covers a series of phenomena which\r\nbegan to surface at that time and subsequently evolved\r\nand developed to become part of the global scenario. In\r\nmy view, this rapid emergence of phenomena,\r\nsimultaneously all round the world, each of them with so\r\nmany distinguishing characteristics, has made it more\r\ndifficult to understand, appreciate and realistically\r\nperceive what is actually happening in the world today.\r\nMany analysts of that time spoke of quantum leaps.\r\nI believe that a quantum leap is indeed under way; there\r\nis an ongoing process of universal change, mutation even.\r\nI also believe that we must sharpen our ability to analyse\r\nand observe this phenomenon — open conflicts, resurgent\r\nnationalisms, racial and religious conflicts — which are\r\noccurring in a world that is undergoing processes of\r\nfusion while at the same time undergoing dangerous and\r\nalarming processes of fission. We are entering the new\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\ncentury with these signs around us which at one and the\r\nsame time are cause for concern and reason for optimism\r\nat the changes unfolding. Actually, there are many\r\npraiseworthy things about the century that is closing, but\r\nthere are also many things worthy of condemnation and\r\nfrom which we should learn our lesson so that they do not\r\nrecur.\r\nWithin that process of universal change, there is a\r\ncountry small in size, a nearby country — Venezuela —\r\nthat faces its own changes; a country that is undertaking its\r\nown irrevocable and necessary changes; a country that is\r\nbeing reborn from its own ashes; a country that is once\r\nagain raising the flag of true, authentic democracy. I shall\r\nspeak a few words here about that country, my country, our\r\ncountry, your country: Venezuela. Venezuela, blessed by\r\nthe hand of God; Venezuela, in the very north with an\r\noutstanding geographic location; Venezuela, full of\r\nincalculable natural wealth; Venezuela, which has one of\r\nthe world’s largest oil reserves and mineral resources of all\r\nkinds, such as gold, diamonds, bauxite and iron ore;\r\nVenezuela, which has water; Venezuela, which has fertile\r\nsoil; Venezuela, which has scarcely 20 million inhabitants\r\nfor almost 1 million square kilometres. But 80 per cent of\r\nthe inhabitants of this wealth-filled country are poor.\r\nFor many years it was said of Venezuela that it was a\r\nmodel of democracy in the world and in Latin America.\r\nHowever, today it is undergoing a process of profound\r\nchange, a crisis unprecedented in our history — a moral\r\ncrisis, an economic crisis, a political crisis, a social\r\ncrisis — which has brought it to dangerous extremes, with\r\nexplosive forces that have been building for decades.\r\nEven so, in Venezuela we have found a peaceful way\r\nout of the morass, the tragedy. We have discovered a way\r\nthat is fully democratic. We have encouraged changes in\r\nVenezuela towards respect for human rights, as is right and\r\nproper, because, however tragic the situation, however\r\nurgent the need for change, never, in our view, should\r\nhuman rights, respect for freedom of expression, respect for\r\nthe intrinsic values of the individual, respect for freedom of\r\nthe press and respect for freedom of thought be set aside.\r\nThe Venezuelan people has arisen from its own ashes.\r\nI should also like to add — and you, Mr. President,\r\nand members undoubtedly know this — that the\r\nVenezuelan people is a people with a great historical\r\nlegacy: it is the birthplace of Simón Bolívar, the Liberator,\r\none of the greats of the millennium. Venezuela carries in its\r\nessence the seed of democracy, of fraternity and solidarity.\r\nWe must therefore acknowledge the ability of Venezuelan\r\npeople, which we represent here in this Assembly, to find\r\npeaceful and democratic solutions to a profound crisis\r\nwhich in other places and other eras, would have given\r\nrise to the violent and regrettable acts that have\r\nsubmerged many peoples in fratricidal conflict for years\r\nand even decades at a time.\r\nWe know that the world has had a great deal of\r\nnews about Venezuela in recent months, some of it a little\r\ndisturbing as a result of the confusion and speed of the\r\nchanges. I thank representatives for allowing me a few\r\nminutes to take the opportunity to assure the entire world\r\nthat in Venezuela there was respect, is respect and will\r\ncontinue to be respect for a democratic process which\r\nemanates from the will of the people. For example, last\r\nDecember there were elections in Venezuela, which\r\nproduced a positive result for democracy. We won the\r\nelections with almost 60 per cent of the popular vote.\r\nSubsequently, on 2 February this year, the very day\r\nthat we arrived at the Government Palace, we did\r\nsomething which had never before happened in my\r\ncountry: we called for a national referendum. In that\r\nreferendum, held on 25 April, the country voted for the\r\nelectoral path leading to a constituent assembly. Ninety-\r\ntwo per cent said “Yes”, and on 25 July there were open\r\nelections, in which all political and social sectors\r\nparticipated, with absolute freedom of expression,\r\nfreedom of criticism and freedom of the press, the likes\r\nof which had never occurred in my country.\r\nThe National Constituent Assembly that resulted\r\nfrom that electoral process consists of 131 Venezuelan\r\nmen and women, representing the broadest segments of\r\nsociety, including indigenous peoples, because for the first\r\ntime in Venezuela\u0027s history a group of aborigines\r\nrepresent the indigenous peoples of Venezuela in the great\r\nAssembly. The Assembly members have been working\r\ntogether for a month and a half on a new national\r\nconstitution in a mechanism of cooperation. The entire\r\ncountry is promoting progress towards this new\r\nConstitution; for the sake of the democracy we are\r\ndefending and advocating, it will be approved only by the\r\ncountry. It will not enter into force until it is approved by\r\nthe Venezuelans in a new referendum, which we hope\r\nwill be held in November, or at the latest in December.\r\nIn other words, when the new century dawns next\r\nyear Venezuela will have a new political project, a\r\nfundamental new charter as the foundation of the new\r\nRepublic and of truly legitimate executive power\r\ngoverning by democracy — as Abraham Lincoln said, for\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nthe people and by the people. We will have a genuine\r\njudicial power, which we had lost in the past few years\r\nowing to corruption. This judicial power will administer\r\njustice. We rely on true legislative power to respond to the\r\ncalls and needs of the Venezuelan people.\r\nWe also propose the establishment of a fourth\r\npower — moral power — to combat corruption, the mother\r\nof all Venezuelan crises of recent years, and to fight for\r\neducation, especially for children. We further propose an\r\nelectoral power to achieve a balance of power. There will\r\nbe a division of powers, particularly legitimate powers, with\r\nthe profound popular content of true democracy.\r\nWe are also promoting a new economic model for\r\nVenezuela. For 20 years we experienced a terrible crisis\r\nthat produced the breakdown of a country, the breakdown\r\nof a model. We are now promoting a humanistic,\r\nproductive, competitive and diversified economic model,\r\nbased on the great potential of our country and\r\nincorporating the world currents of a new international\r\neconomic order, with greater justice and a human face,\r\nwhich will facilitate satisfying the needs of the human\r\nbeing. This must be one of the fundamental goals of any\r\neconomic process.\r\nIn just over six months we have been able to come\r\nhere to tell the world of our successes — small successes,\r\nbut they presage what is going to happen in Venezuela. We\r\nhave undertaken an economic revitalization, respecting all\r\neconomic freedoms. In a healthy coexistence between the\r\nState and the market, we have been gaining ground in the\r\nmacroeconomic area. We have started to bring down\r\ninflation; maintained our international reserves; helped raise\r\nthe price of a barrel of oil, in cooperation with the other\r\noil-producing countries; and brought about an exchange\r\nbalance. We have also been revitalizing some production\r\nsectors, and we are calling on global investors to invest in\r\nvarious petrochemical, gas, touristic, industrial and\r\nagricultural projects and enterprises. We are thus building\r\na new economic model.\r\nWe are also building a new society based on public\r\nmorality in respect of human rights. I shall give an\r\nexample, small, but one which says a lot about what is\r\nhappening in Venezuela in terms of the social order. Barely\r\nthree days ago the 1999-2000 school year began. This year\r\nthe school matriculation — that is, the number of students\r\nin public schools — increased by 25 per cent. As a result\r\nof a model of privatization of education, and of the poverty\r\nthat has been invading the social strata, many children and\r\nyoung people did not go to school; they could not pay the\r\nfees, nor could they pay for school supplies. This year we\r\nhave opened up the schools and we have been repairing\r\nthem. Now we are very happy to tell the world that in\r\njust six months the number of children and young people\r\nstarting a new school year has increased by 25 per cent.\r\nFurthermore, attention to education has gone beyond\r\nbeing one of the principal national priorities; it is now a\r\nmatter of States.\r\nThe same can be said of health. We have activated\r\na special plan which we call “Project Bolivar 2000”. For\r\nsix months we have been dealing with Venezuelans\u0027\r\ngreatest needs, such as health, road repairs and opening\r\nways of penetration and activation of some sectors of\r\nmicroenterprises. We have set up a people\u0027s bank to\r\nprovide microcredit especially to bring about the recovery\r\nof the economy, the microeconomy. We have created a\r\nunique social fund to promote solutions basically for\r\nhealth and education.\r\nAs can be seen, we are promoting a genuine process\r\nof transition: politically, socially, economically and, above\r\nall, ethically. A new Venezuela is being born, born to\r\npresent itself to the world free and sovereign, ready to\r\ntake up firmly the flags of a new world, a fairer world.\r\nWe are in solidarity with the struggles of the world. The\r\nworld of the century to come must be much better than\r\nthe world of the twentieth century which is ending. We\r\ncall out for justice for the peoples of the third world, for\r\nequality and human development. We appeal for the\r\nintegration of peoples and for peace. Only a country\r\nrevitalized from within can be incorporated by its own\r\nstrength into the international relations of a modern world,\r\nsuch as the world which is dawning.\r\nIn this part of South America, Venezuela is being\r\nreborn and offering the world its heart, its arms of\r\nintegration. I give a special salute to all the peoples of the\r\nLatin American continent and the Caribbean, Central\r\nAmerica, North America, Asia, Africa, Europe and\r\nOceania. We must continue together, with a new sense of\r\nbrotherhood, to struggle for a better world.\r\nIn this my first statement to the General Assembly,\r\nin the last session of the century, when we are preparing\r\nfor the Millennium Assembly, I should like to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, the Secretary-General\r\nand all the world representatives gathered here at the\r\nUnited Nations, because we are aware of the great effort\r\nbeing made to reform and perfect the machinery to\r\nachieve peace, brotherhood and solidarity in a world that\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nis, as I said at the beginning, undergoing profound change.\r\nThese words come from my heart and go out to the\r\nentire world in the name of a people who are themselves\r\nbeing reborn — the Venezuelan people — with our best\r\nwishes that each day we may find greater strength and\r\ncome closer to attaining — as I said before — the path to\r\npeace, brotherhood, development, justice and self-\r\ndetermination. Let us not say as someone else has said that\r\npeace has broken out. Rather, let us say that in the next few\r\nyears we may all be able to proclaim loudly that peace,\r\ndemocracy and development have triumphed.\r\nI send a warm embrace to you all on behalf of the\r\npeople of Simon Bolivar, the people of Venezuela.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Venezuela\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the Republic of\r\nVenezuela, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Saúl Menem, President of the\r\nArgentine Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Argentine Republic.\r\nMr. Carlos Saúl Menem, President of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic, His Excellency\r\nMr. Carlos Saúl Menem, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Menem (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nare pleased that an important figure in Namibia\u0027s attainment\r\nof independence has the responsibility of conducting this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI also wish to express my appreciation to the Foreign\r\nMinister of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his skill in\r\npresiding over the previous session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAfter 10 years as President of Argentina, and with my\r\nconstitutional mandate about to end, I should like to share\r\nwith the Assembly the transformations that Argentina has\r\nexperienced during this time, in a world which has also\r\nbeen transformed.\r\nIn the past 10 years we have experienced a change\r\nof Copernican dimensions. It started with the recovery of\r\ndemocracy. Since that time we have built a stable political\r\nsystem based on the popular will and respect for the rule\r\nof law. We have made respect for human rights a sacred\r\nvalue. We are at peace with all our neighbours, with\r\nwhich we have now undertaken a robust integration\r\nprocess. We have put an end to proliferation policies and\r\nhave actively committed ourselves to peacekeeping\r\noperations. We have developed an open and free\r\neconomy, worked to combat poverty and inequality of\r\nopportunity and fought discrimination in all its forms. In\r\nshort, we have recovered and embraced the high values of\r\nour culture, which are the essence of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and which we hope to bring with us into\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nAt the regional level, which is our natural sphere of\r\ninterest, we have solved all outstanding border and\r\ndemarcation issues with the Republic of Chile and thus\r\nopened the way for fruitful integration. We have\r\nestablished consultation and coordination mechanisms\r\nwith Brazil and Chile on security and defence issues. We\r\nare convinced that security depends much more on\r\nfriendship and cooperation with our neighbours than on\r\nwhat we spend on weapons. As one of the guarantors of\r\nthe Rio de Janeiro Protocol, we contributed to the peace\r\nagreement between Peru and Ecuador. We are working\r\ntirelessly for the consolidation of democracy and\r\ndevelopment in our region.\r\nIn the field of disarmament and the non-proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, we have taken the\r\nfollowing steps. On 28 November 1990 we signed the Foz\r\ndo Iguaçú Joint Declaration, which consolidated the\r\npolicy of nuclear transparency with Brazil, and since then\r\nwe have developed a common peaceful and non-\r\nproliferation nuclear policy. Argentina acceded to the\r\nTreaty of Tlatelolco, in 1994; the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in 1995; and the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, in 1998. We are\r\nalso members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and in\r\n1993 Argentina joined the Missile Technology Control\r\nRegime.\r\nIn the field of space activities, the National\r\nCommission for Space Activities has worked with the\r\nUnited States National Aeronautics and Space\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nAdministration (NASA) on the SAC-B satellite mission, the\r\nplacement in orbit and operation of the SAC-A satellite\r\ntechnology mission and the forthcoming launch of the SAC-\r\nC satellite mission, Argentina\u0027s first Earth observation\r\nsatellite. We have also started some ambitious projects in\r\nthis field with Brazil, as well as with Canada, France,\r\nGermany and the United Kingdom.\r\nWe have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention,\r\nand we are working on a monitoring mechanism for the\r\nBiological Weapons Convention. In this context, Argentina\r\njoined the Australian Group on 11 December 1992.\r\nArgentina\u0027s self-restraint in the development of nuclear\r\nweapons is recognized as an example by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nOn 14 September this year Argentina ratified the\r\nOttawa Convention on the prohibition of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines.\r\nAt the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR) summit in Ushuaia, Argentina, on 24 July\r\n1998, MERCOSUR, Bolivia and Chile were declared a\r\nzone of peace and a zone free of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. A commitment was also made to declare the\r\narea a zone free of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nWe believe that all States must renounce nuclear\r\nweapons and give unequivocal guarantees that their nuclear\r\ncapability and most advanced technology are exclusively for\r\npeaceful purposes.\r\nAllow me once more to refer to the pending\r\nsovereignty dispute concerning the Malvinas Islands. One\r\nof the first measures we adopted upon taking office was to\r\nre-establish diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom,\r\nin February 1990. A new stage was thereby begun in which\r\nthe ties between the two countries were taken to their\r\nhighest level in history. This was reaffirmed by my recent\r\nvisit, as President, to the United Kingdom and that of His\r\nRoyal Highness Prince Charles to Argentina. Since then,\r\nwhile reaffirming our sovereignty rights and motivated by\r\na spirit of reconciliation, we have worked harmoniously\r\nwith the United Kingdom on various matters relating to the\r\nSouth Atlantic, such as the rebuilding of a climate of\r\nmutual trust in the area, the preservation of live marine\r\nresources, the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons,\r\nthe resumption of flights between the continent and the\r\nMalvinas Islands, and the access of persons carrying\r\nArgentine identity documents to the Malvinas Islands.\r\nArgentina is a country that is proud of its cultural\r\ndiversity. Our Constitution establishes as a national goal\r\nthe recovery of the Malvinas Islands while guaranteeing\r\nthe strictest respect for the way of life of their inhabitants.\r\nI am convinced that the conditions exist for Argentina and\r\nthe United Kingdom to begin without further delay a\r\ndialogue towards a definitive solution of the sovereignty\r\ndispute, thus fulfilling the numerous resolutions adopted\r\nby the General Assembly and the Special Political and\r\nDecolonization Committee.\r\nArgentina is the sixth-largest troop contributor to the\r\nOrganization. At this time, we are involved in 10 of the\r\n17 current operations, including those in Kosovo and East\r\nTimor. We have also incorporated personnel from other\r\nLatin American countries into our troops.\r\nIn Argentina, the defence and promotion of human\r\nrights is a State policy. That is why we have actively\r\nparticipated in the establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court, as a way to put an end to the culture of\r\nimpunity.\r\nThe numerous humanitarian missions in which\r\n“White Helmets” have been deployed in South America,\r\nCentral America, the Middle East, Africa and the\r\nCaucasus are a reflection of the success of this initiative,\r\nwhich I put forward in 1993. Argentina agrees with the\r\nSecretary-General that the “White Helmets” can provide\r\nassistance, in close partnership with the Blue Helmets, in\r\nconflict situations.\r\nArgentina supports a world economy of open\r\nmarkets. However, we see the re-emergence of hidden\r\nforms of protectionism. This is why we call on all States,\r\nin particular to the most developed ones, to take part in\r\nthe “millennium round”, with the goal of attaining an\r\nopen, multilateral system that excludes no sector of\r\neconomic activity.\r\nAs evidence of our concern regarding environmental\r\nissues, in November 1998 Argentina hosted the fourth\r\nmeeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\r\nwhich adopted the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. During\r\nthe fifth ministerial meeting of the Zone of Peace and\r\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, which was held in\r\nBuenos Aires in October 1998, a Plan of Action was\r\nadopted for the first time in order to carry out the\r\nobjectives of the Zone, which include the protection of\r\nthe environment and of living resources.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nThe international community must urgently prepare\r\ncontingency plans to face the year 2000 problem in such a\r\nway that essential community services are not affected.\r\nSince 1 January 1999, Argentina has been an elected\r\nmember of the Security Council. I would like briefly to\r\nshare some thoughts with the Assembly.\r\nThe responsibility of the Security Council in the\r\nmaintenance of peace cannot be irreplaceable, and its\r\nauthority must be strengthened.\r\nThe Council must work in cooperation with other\r\nbodies of the United Nations system and with regional\r\norganizations in order to carry out its tasks effectively.\r\nWe have a responsibility towards the men and women\r\nwho make up the Blue Helmets, as well as towards those\r\nwho perform humanitarian work in conflict situations. It is\r\nour obligation to protect them. We call upon countries to\r\nratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel.\r\nConcerning the reform of the Security Council,\r\nArgentina supports the creation of a system of non-\r\ndiscriminatory, open rotation. It would be unfair and\r\nunrealistic, at the beginning of a new millennium, to\r\nmultiply the privileges and discriminatory practices that\r\ncame about only as a result of war in 1945. Therefore, no\r\nnew categories of membership should be introduced in\r\nregions where those categories do not exist, especially if\r\ntradition and history do not warrant it.\r\nFinally, I am convinced that the United Nations is\r\ncalled upon to play an even more relevant role in the\r\ntwenty-first century. Argentina, which is now to be among\r\nthe 15 main countries of the Organization, will participate\r\nwith the same conviction as always in the realization of the\r\nnoble objectives of the Charter.\r\nOnce again, I thank you, Sir, and all the Members of\r\nthe United Nations. After 10 years and six months, I bid\r\nyou farewell for the last time.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Argentine Republic for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Carlos Saúl Menem, President of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Mikuláš Dzurinda, Prime\r\nMinister of the Slovak Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Mikuláš Dzurinda, Prime Minister of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mikuláš Dzurinda, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Dzurinda (Slovakia): I would like to express\r\nmy sincere congratulations, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession and to extend my best wishes for a successful\r\nconduct of the deliberations and work of this body.\r\nI wish also to thank your predecessor, Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti, for his leadership and his personal contribution to\r\nthe achievements of the fifty-third session.\r\nThe United Nations was created over 50 years ago\r\nin specific political circumstances marked by enthusiasm\r\nbrought about by the end of the Second World War. Its\r\nestablishment was a very important step towards a new\r\nglobal order, although the political situation dominated by\r\nsuper-Power rivalry over next several decades prevented\r\nit from using its potential to the full. The current\r\ninternational political situation is much more propitious\r\nfor pursuing the original purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Following the end of the bipolar\r\ndivision of the world, we have witnessed new political\r\nprocesses that have profoundly changed the political\r\nlandscape. An ever- growing number of countries are\r\nembracing democratic principles and implementing them\r\nin practice. This should be emphasized, especially in a\r\nforum such as the General Assembly, because the spread\r\nof democracy gives momentum to the work of the United\r\nNations and stimulates the expansion of its activities\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nA growing number of countries are acknowledging\r\ntheir share of the global responsibility for a better life on\r\nour planet and for the wise exploitation of its resources.\r\nIn this era of globalization and interdependence, the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nUnited Nations plays a unique and irreplaceable role. Its\r\nfundamental and key tasks — safeguarding peace and\r\nsecurity; promoting economic cooperation and social\r\ndevelopment, including poverty eradication; strengthening\r\nthe role of international law; and protecting human\r\nrights — are even more relevant today than they were 54\r\nyears ago. The Slovak Republic is very much aware of this\r\nfact.\r\nOne of the crucial issues in reforming the Organization\r\nand preparing it for the challenges that lie ahead is the\r\nreform of the Security Council. The Security Council is the\r\nsymbol and pillar of the concept of collective security,\r\ndesigned in the aftermath of the most tragic conflict of this\r\ncentury in order to prevent its repetition.\r\nThe fundamental political changes that have taken\r\nplace in the world in the last 50 years represent a challenge\r\nto the future role of the Security Council and its legitimacy.\r\nWe must draw lessons from past setbacks. Caused mostly\r\nby the divergent interests of major actors or by a lack of\r\npolitical will, they paralysed the Security Council, which\r\nremained inactive instead of taking effective action on\r\nbehalf of the Member States. Otherwise, we risk the erosion\r\nof the authority of the Security Council and consequently\r\nof its central role in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. The United Nations cannot afford to let that\r\nhappen, because there is no alternative to the concept of\r\ncollective security as embodied in the United Nations\r\nCharter. The modern world needs a supreme security\r\nauthority with unquestioned credibility.\r\nThe key tasks of Security Council reform are to\r\nstrengthen its representative character, improve the\r\neffectiveness and transparency of its decision-making\r\nprocess and working methods and, ultimately, enhance its\r\nlegitimacy. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to reach the\r\nwidest possible agreement on enlarging its membership and\r\non the veto right, which plays a pivotal role in the overall\r\nreform of the Council. Unless the scope of application of\r\nthe veto and its relationship to potential new members of\r\nthe Security Council are clarified, it will be very difficult\r\nto proceed to the enlargement of the category of permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nSlovakia recognizes as legitimate the efforts of some\r\ncountries, which, being capable of assuming a share of the\r\ngobal responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, desire a position in an enlarged Security\r\nCouncil. At the same time, however, it is necessary to\r\nensure the appropriate representation of the developing\r\ncountries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nregion, since those countries represent a significant\r\nmajority of the United Nations membership.\r\nRegrettably, as the past six years of discussions in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council have shown, a\r\nfundamental divergence of views continues to exist with\r\nregard to enlarging the category of permanent members,\r\nthus making it very unlikely that concrete results will be\r\nachieved in the near future.\r\nWe believe that in order to move ahead, we should\r\nproceed gradually rather than running in place in order to\r\nprevent the United Nations from “missing the boat” in our\r\nrapidly changing world. If there is no agreement on other\r\ncategories of membership, Slovakia is ready, at this stage,\r\nto support expanding only the non-permanent category.\r\nThe overall number of seats in the enlarged Security\r\nCouncil would then depend on the scenario eventually\r\nagreed on by Member States. Nevertheless, it should not\r\nexceed the range of 23 to 25 in order to preserve its\r\ncapability to act promptly. I would like to point out that\r\nSlovakia is flexible in this regard. The expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council should also take into account an\r\nappropriate increase in the representation of the Eastern\r\nEuropean regional Group, whose membership has more\r\nthan doubled in recent years.\r\nPeacekeeping operations continue to be one of the\r\nkey instruments available to the United Nations in the\r\ndischarge of its primary responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. Nevertheless, in the\r\nlight of the tragic experience of recent and still-raging\r\nconflicts, it is necessary to reinforce those mechanisms,\r\nwhich would allow the United Nations to more actively\r\nconcentrate on preventing conflicts and addressing their\r\ncauses rather than their consequences. An early- warning\r\nsystem should be further enhanced, and preventive\r\ndiplomacy should play a more active role in potential\r\nconflict situations.\r\nToday’s conflicts have many dimensions, which\r\nmust be addressed comprehensively. An integrated,\r\nmultidimensional approach to peacekeeping and post-\r\nconflict peace-building must be taken if a conflict is to be\r\nresolved in a durable manner. It is important to ensure an\r\neffective coordination among the military, civilian and\r\nhumanitarian components of multidisciplinary operations,\r\nwhich should be given adequate mandates and resources.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nAs time is a crucial factor in most cases of\r\ndeployment of peacekeeping forces, Slovakia supports the\r\nefforts to enhance United Nations rapid-deployment\r\ncapabilities through the United Nations standby\r\narrangements system. Regional initiatives play an important\r\nrole in this respect, and Slovakia has therefore joined the\r\nCentral European Nations Cooperation in Peace Support,\r\naimed at closer cooperation among several Central\r\nEuropean States in the field of the preparation, training and\r\nparticipation of their armed forces in peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nSince its admission to the United Nations Slovakia has\r\nbeen contributing to a number of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia and Europe,\r\nincluding those in Angola, Rwanda, the border region of\r\nUganda and Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Syrian\r\nGolan Heights, Jerusalem, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia\r\nand Eastern Slavonia. The Slovak Government has also\r\nrecently decided to contribute an engineering unit to the\r\nUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western\r\nSahara (MINURSO). Slovakia thus ranks among the leading\r\ntroop contributors in terms of the number of troops per\r\ncapita. I would like to take this opportunity to assure the\r\nAssembly that Slovakia is determined to continue to support\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities in all the main\r\nareas: troops, logistics and training.\r\nThe active participation of the Slovak Republic in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities has proved that it\r\nhas a responsible approach to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and has logically led to the\r\nsubmission of its candidature for the non-permanent seat in\r\nthe Security Council for the term 2000-2001. Through\r\nmembership in the Security Council, Slovakia would like to\r\nprove that small countries, too, can make an important\r\ncontribution to the resolution of conflicts and crises in the\r\nworld.\r\nKosovo is the most recent example of the tragic reality\r\nof the present-day Balkans, driven by violence and ethnic\r\nhatred, which is not only a product of the region’s\r\ncomplicated historical circumstances, but, above all, the\r\nresult of human rights violations and of the misuse of\r\nethnic differences to reach short-sighted political goals.\r\nSlovakia attaches great importance to the political resolution\r\nof the Kosovo conflict, and appreciates the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Secretary-General, the Contact Group\r\ndealing with the former Yugoslavia and regional\r\norganizations to this end. We welcomed with great hope the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), aimed\r\nat creating conditions for building a democratic Kosovo\r\nbased on respect for the human rights of all citizens,\r\nregardless of their ethnic origin and religion, and for all\r\nthe principles enshrined in Article 2 of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nPost-conflict peace-building in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina has proved that reconstruction of a\r\nconflict-torn society on a multi-ethnic basis is in no way\r\nan easy task. However, if new tragedies are to be\r\nprevented, the international community must give a hand\r\nto the people in that part of Europe in their quest for\r\nreconciliation and for building mutual trust. An important\r\nrole in these efforts is to be played by the economic\r\nreconstruction and development of the entire Balkan\r\nregion.\r\nIn this connection, Slovakia welcomes and fully\r\nsupports the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. I\r\nbelieve it will open a new stage in the history of the\r\nregion. The proof of the importance which the Slovak\r\nRepublic attaches to securing stability in this part of\r\nEurope is the appointment of the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Slovakia, Mr. Eduard Kukan, as the Special\r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for the Balkans. A\r\nconference was held under his auspices in Bratislava, the\r\ncapital of Slovakia, on the post-war reconstruction of the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. The conference clearly\r\nshowed the direction which the international community\r\nand Yugoslav society should take if the country is to\r\nbecome a firm part of the community of nations in the\r\nBalkans, built on new foundations.\r\nThe Slovak Republic considers a just peace in the\r\nMiddle East to be an important component of global\r\nstability. For this reason, we welcomed the signing, on 4\r\nSeptember 1999, of a new agreement between Israel and\r\nthe Palestinian Authority on the implementation of\r\nindividual steps of the Wye Memorandum. At the same\r\ntime, we hope that Israel, Syria and Lebanon will also\r\nrenew their dialogues. Although certain issues remain to\r\nbe resolved among the parties, we believe that a final\r\nagreement will eventually be reached and a permanent\r\npeace will be secured for the Middle East region.\r\nThe continent of Africa is suffering from far too\r\nmany conflicts, often fed by poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. Clearly, cooperation between the\r\ninternational community and African States is greatly\r\nneeded in order to prevent and to address conflicts and to\r\nhelp Africa to create conditions for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Slovakia shares the Secretary-General’s\r\nview, expressed in his report on Africa last year, that\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nAfricans themselves must demonstrate the political will to\r\nrespond to problems by peaceful means and to adhere to\r\nthe rules of good governance through ensuring respect for\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law, strengthening\r\ndemocratization and promoting transparency in public\r\nadministration. In the meantime, the assistance of the\r\ninternational community is important not only for the\r\neconomic development of African States, but also to enable\r\nthem to build their own capacity for conflict prevention and\r\nresolution.\r\nThe African regional and subregional organizations,\r\nsuch as the Organization of African Unity, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, should be given credit\r\nfor the role they have played in the implementation of\r\npeace operations in several African countries, and should be\r\nprovided with the necessary financial and material\r\nassistance. Slovakia is ready to contribute its share — for\r\ninstance, by offering its Training Centre for Peacekeeping\r\nOperations, which has specific facilities for training\r\nengineering units.\r\nAnother pressing problem is the prevention of the\r\nillicit flow of arms and military material into zones of\r\nconflict, and the enforcement of an effective\r\nimplementation of the Security Council arms embargoes.\r\nThe most disturbing fact is that the Security Council’s\r\nsanctions are violated mostly by non-African countries\r\nwhich have turned Africa into a store for all kinds of\r\nweapons. Slovakia firmly adheres to all Security Council\r\ndecisions, including sanctions. We believe that Security\r\nCouncil sanctions committees should be actively engaged\r\nin ensuring the concerted efforts of all the actors concerned\r\n— Governments, international governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, private companies and\r\nleaders of opinion — in order to identify the sources of\r\narms flows into zones of conflict and cut off military forces\r\nand rebel groups from their resources, thus eliminating their\r\nability to wage war.\r\nI realize that the United Nations is not only a\r\npeacekeeper; it also has a role to play in the everyday lives\r\nof many people suffering from hunger, poverty, disease,\r\nilliteracy and backwardness. All of us are obligated to\r\npromote sustainable development and to protect the global\r\nenvironment and human rights. The best way to prevent and\r\neliminate conflicts is to create conditions for a worthy life\r\nfor every individual on this planet as well as friendly\r\nrelations among nations based on the principles of equal\r\nrights, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human\r\nrights.\r\nBeing a small country, the Slovak Republic does not\r\nalways have means to resolve global issues comparable to\r\nthose that some big countries have. But it compensates\r\nfor this disadvantage with its determined and active\r\napproach to all the major problems that mankind is\r\nfacing. As experience has shown, small and medium-sized\r\ncountries can contribute significantly to the resolution of\r\ncrises and conflicts. This may be due to the fact that these\r\ncountries are not burdened with power interests and are\r\ncapable of presenting and advocating solutions acceptable\r\nto all. Slovakia has already demonstrated its ability to be\r\nan active player in international relations. The United\r\nNations and its Security Council are the forums in which\r\nwe can put this valuable experience to the best use.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mikuláš Dzurinda, Prime Minister of the Slovak\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nModibo Sidibe, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mali.\r\nMr. Sidibe (Mali) (spoke in French): I wish first to\r\ncongratulate you warmly, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. This does honour to your country, Namibia, and\r\nis a source of joy and satisfaction to all of Africa, and\r\nparticularly to my country, Mali. You may count on the\r\nfull support of my delegation, on behalf of which it is my\r\nhonour to address the General Assembly today. I am\r\nconvinced that with your talent and your experience as an\r\nestimable diplomat you will guide the work of the\r\nAssembly to a successful conclusion.\r\nI wish also to take this opportunity to convey to\r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti, our\r\nsatisfaction at the commitment and skill with which he\r\nguided the work of the Assembly at its fifty-third session.\r\nLet me also reaffirm the gratitude of the Government\r\nof Mali to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for the determination and wisdom he has shown\r\nin the quest for solutions to the central concerns of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\r\ntaking place at the dawn of the third millennium, at a\r\ntime when the gap between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping worlds is growing ever larger. Imbalances in\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nthe world economy, the unequal distribution of wealth,\r\npoverty, grave and massive violations of human rights,\r\nmassacres and conflicts of every kind pose a serious threat\r\nto international stability.\r\nDespite significant progress in many areas, the United\r\nNations continues to face daunting challenges. It must\r\nformulate a collective approach with shared responsibility\r\nand greater, more effective solidarity to bring about the\r\neconomic cooperation that is indispensable for lasting peace\r\nand security for all. In that context, many and varied\r\nchallenges face Mali, Africa, the world at large, and the\r\nUnited Nations at the end of the twentieth century, such as\r\ndebt, development financing, security including\r\ndisarmament and international terrorism, democracy, human\r\nrights, international migration and United Nations reform.\r\nLast year we spoke out from this rostrum against a\r\nglobalization dominated by market forces and a financial\r\napproach, and in favour of a globalization based on\r\nsustainable human development. That is the real challenge,\r\nand our growing conviction is that we can resolve all\r\npresent imbalances if, through renewed, responsible and\r\ncandid political dialogue, we tackle them with a global and\r\nunified vision, with commitment to genuine partnership, and\r\nwith a sense of shared, equal responsibility in the building\r\nof a better world, a world for mankind. That is the\r\napproach we must take to addressing the problems of\r\ndeveloping countries: indebtedness, their integration as real\r\nactors in the world economy, and development financing.\r\nThe problem of developing-country indebtedness must\r\ncontinue to be a focus of the attention of the international\r\ncommunity with a view to finding a lasting solution that\r\nwill be acceptable to all. To be sure, the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative and the initiative\r\nadopted at the Cologne summit of the Group of Seven in\r\nJune 1999 were important steps. But, because it absorbs\r\nmore than a third of the export income of developing\r\ncountries and because debt-servicing costs imperil the\r\nfuture of generations to come, debt is an insurmountable\r\nobstacle to any development effort. The debt burden must\r\nnot merely be lightened; debts must be cancelled. Without\r\nplaying down any responsibility here, debt cancellation has\r\nbecome necessary in order to enable the efforts and\r\nsacrifices made by developing countries to yield their full\r\nbenefits for their peoples. Debt cancellation, along with a\r\nnew, more rational debt policy based on the productive\r\ncapacities of these countries, would lay the foundations for\r\ntrue, sustainable development financing.\r\nLong seen as an act of generosity by the rich\r\ntowards the poor, development assistance is now viewed\r\nas a tangible expression of a solidarity that is\r\nindispensable. It has significantly declined in recent years,\r\nand we must do everything possible to reverse that trend\r\nin order to better meet the financing needs of developing\r\ncountries. My country, Mali — which has already enacted\r\nsignificant political, economic and structural reforms —\r\nhopes that special attention will be given to the situation\r\nof African countries in any consideration of this matter.\r\nI appeal to developed countries completely to fulfil their\r\ncommitment to increase official development assistance,\r\nto build up our economic capacities in the areas of\r\nprocessing and marketing our commodities, and to pay\r\nproper prices for our products and facilitate market\r\naccess.\r\nThe current state of affairs demands a new\r\npartnership based on an acknowledgement that\r\ndevelopment financing is a shared responsibility, which\r\nshould be reflected in more equitable burden-sharing\r\namong donors. Here, the high-level meeting on\r\ndevelopment financing is of crucial importance. My\r\ndelegation believes that that meeting should be seen in the\r\ntwo-fold context of follow-up to the major summits and\r\ninternational conferences of the 1990s and of the General\r\nAssembly’s Agenda for Development.\r\nMore than half a century after the creation of the\r\nUnited Nations, there is no further need to prove its\r\nrelevance and contribution to the disarmament agenda and\r\nto building international peace and security. Here I stress\r\nthe particular importance that Mali attaches to\r\ndisarmament in general and to micro-disarmament in\r\nparticular. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones on the basis of arrangements freely entered into\r\namong the States of the region concerned, and the\r\nextension of such zones to all regions of the world, will\r\nmake a significant contribution to international peace and\r\nsecurity. In that connection, I would recall that Mali has\r\nratified the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty —\r\nthe Pelindaba Treaty — to manifest its support for the\r\ninitiative to make Africa a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nHowever, let us make no mistake about it, what\r\ntoday seriously threatens peace, the security of women,\r\nmen and children in Africa are small arms and anti-\r\npersonnel mines.\r\nAs we take stock of the progress made in combating\r\nthe proliferation of small arms since the fifty-third\r\nsession, while we appreciate the efforts of the United\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nNations Panel of Governmental Experts, we totally support\r\nthe appeal for action adopted by the International\r\nConference on Sustainable Disarmament for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, held in Brussels on 12 and 13 October 1998.\r\nWe should welcome the historic decision of the member\r\ncountries of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), on the initiative of Mali, to declare a\r\nmoratorium on the export, import and production of small\r\narms starting on 1 November 1998 and lasting for three\r\nyears, a moratorium that is supported by a code of conduct.\r\nThe meeting of the ECOWAS Ministers for Foreign Affairs\r\nthat was held in Bamako in March 1999, defined the\r\nmodalities for the implementation of the programme of\r\ncoordination and assistance for security and development,\r\nand adopted a plan of action in nine priority areas to make\r\nthe moratorium operational. These efforts deserve support\r\nfrom the international community so that there will be more\r\noverall cooperation to stem the proliferation of small arms\r\nand mitigate their devastating effects.\r\nAlso, it is essential to support and extend this\r\nmoratorium, to apply more strictly the laws and rules in\r\nforce on arms transfers, to improve them and strengthen\r\nthem at all levels and to back them up with codes of\r\nconduct. We also need to strengthen the capacity of States\r\nand increase coordination to deal with this phenomenon.\r\nBut we also need to work on a progressive and effective\r\ninternational normative mechanism to control the circulation\r\nof small arms. We support very strongly the decision of the\r\nAssembly to convene an international conference on this\r\nquestion.\r\nSimilarly, we must continue our work to free the\r\nworld of the scourge of anti-personnel mines, and in\r\nparticular we need to rid Africa of them, for they continue\r\nto sow death and mayhem even after conflicts end. We will\r\nachieve this by working in the context of the Maputo\r\nDeclaration and seeing to it that everyone, without\r\nexception, ratifies and implements the Convention on the\r\nbanning of anti-personnel mines. We ratified the\r\nConvention very early on, and our country has destroyed its\r\nmeagre stock of these weapons, which we never in fact\r\nused. Mali is now adopting the national legislation required\r\nby the Convention on the banning of anti-personnel mines.\r\nIn the last 50 years, peacekeeping operations have\r\nbecome an important tool for resolving conflicts by\r\npeaceful means and for promoting international peace and\r\nsecurity. However, I would like to say that in and of\r\nthemselves, they are not a solution to conflicts, but only\r\nspecial measures to prevent conflicts from getting worse\r\npending a peaceful solution.\r\nOur constant quest for peace is reflected in our\r\neffective participation in peacekeeping operations and our\r\ntotal support for the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution in Africa, to which the\r\ninternational community should give special attention. We\r\nask the international community to mobilize quickly, in\r\ngood time and to a greater extent to support the\r\nimmediate implementation of hard-to-reach and always\r\nprecarious peace agreements, as well as peace-building\r\nprogrammes.\r\nMali also supports any measures to help create a\r\nclimate allowing us to confront the causes of conflicts,\r\nwhich now relate primarily to underdevelopment, poor\r\ngovernance, deficiencies in democracy and bad\r\ncooperation policies. We pin great hopes on the decision\r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to make the\r\nyear 2000 a year of peace and security in Africa, and we\r\nvery much hope that the international community will\r\ngive strong support to our continent in its prevention and\r\npeacekeeping efforts.\r\nI cannot fail to mention here the close link between\r\nsecurity and development and the consequent need to\r\nfinance security as an integral part of development action.\r\nNor can I conclude without mentioning the ghastly,\r\nappalling question of child soldiers.\r\nPresident Konaré has said in this regard,\r\n“we have an absolute responsibility for the sad lot of\r\nchild soldiers, which is not acceptable and cannot be\r\nborne; we must put an end to it by unambiguously\r\ncondemning all those who use these children and\r\nwho instil in them a culture of violence, thus sowing\r\nthe seeds of the perpetuation of violence and\r\nconflicts ... We must work for a real culture of\r\npeace. The place of our children is in school; it is\r\nour responsibility to put an end to this heinous\r\nphenomenon by denouncing it and taking vigorous\r\nsteps against it, including international criminal\r\nsanctions. Post-conflict programmes must include\r\namong their priorities the reintegration through\r\neducation of child soldiers; and in a general way it\r\nmust make education the heart of the strategy for\r\nbuilding peace and sustainable development.”\r\nThe decision to hold a special session of the General\r\nAssembly to follow-up to the World Summit for Children\r\nin 2001 coincides with the commemoration of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nWe must take that opportunity to hasten our attainment of\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nthe objectives that we have set for ourselves with regard to\r\nchildren.\r\nWe have a unique responsibility towards them. The\r\nleast we can do on the eve of the new millennium is to\r\nprovide all boys and girls better health, schools and\r\nprotection from wars and famines.\r\nMali is staunchly committed to democracy and human\r\nrights. Observance of human, political, civil, economic,\r\nsocial and cultural rights is an integral part of economic\r\nprosperity, social equity and the promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity. In this context, a certain number of minimum\r\nstandards are necessary in any democracy based on law and\r\nrespect for human rights. I am referring to values that we\r\nall deem to be fundamental and the observance of which\r\nwe are committed to: rule of law, respect for human rights,\r\na system of democratic government and the conditions for\r\nnecessary changes of government in a republican and\r\ndemocratic system. In a democracy, this is the minimum\r\nthat we must all, each and every one of us, consolidate,\r\nbuild and develop.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains a source of\r\nconcern, despite the revival of the peace process. I wish to\r\nreaffirm here the unreserved support of Mali for the just\r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people as well as for a\r\ncomprehensive just and lasting solution based on the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council and the\r\nprinciple of land for peace.\r\nTurning now to the Lockerbie crisis, Mali, basing\r\nitself on the progress made in dealing with this question,\r\nappeals for the complete, immediate lifting of the sanctions\r\nthat have been unjustly imposed on the fraternal people of\r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahirya, and I am pleased to renew to\r\nthem the support and solidarity of the people of Mali.\r\nLikewise, we are still concerned at the humanitarian cost to\r\ncivilians in other countries that have been unjustly targeted\r\nby sanctions.\r\nSecurity and stability are facing new threats, including\r\nthe problem of drugs — which has become worse with\r\nglobalization — organized crime, international terrorism,\r\nmoney-laundering and corruption. In the face of these\r\nthreats and their adverse effects of them, the international\r\ncommunity must step up its efforts to put in place the\r\nmechanisms necessary to eradicate them and cooperate\r\nbetter in order to combat them. In regard to international\r\nterrorism, Mali signed the African convention in Algiers,\r\nand we support the appeal of the OAU for the speedy\r\nconclusion of an international convention in order better\r\nto prevent terrorism and to combat it more effectively.\r\nToday, when mankind is preparing for a new\r\nmillennium, it is essential to adapt the United Nations to\r\nthe needs of our time. The challenges that we will be\r\nfacing demand that we adopt appropriate measures now\r\nso that the next century will enjoy more peace and more\r\njustice in a new partnership based on solidarity among all\r\nnations.\r\nIf the United Nations is to remain the gathering\r\nplace in which all countries can make their voices heard\r\nto find solutions to problems that confront them, it must\r\nnot be marginalized. Therefore, it is necessary today more\r\nthan ever to review the functioning of the system of the\r\nOrganization in order to adapt it to present and future\r\ncircumstances.\r\nMy delegation is convinced of the need to\r\ndemocratize further our Organization through a\r\ncomprehensive restructuring of its main organs,\r\nparticularly the Security Council, the composition of\r\nwhich reflects the state of the world as it was 50 years\r\nago and which does not in any way reflect the political,\r\neconomic and social realities of today’s or tomorrow’s\r\nworld.\r\nIn addition, my delegation reaffirms Africa’s demand\r\nfor an equitable division among the two categories of\r\nseats. We call upon Member States to reinforce the\r\nprestige, the authority, the effectiveness and the\r\nlegitimacy of the Council.\r\nThis session gives the international community a\r\nunique opportunity to demonstrate once again that the\r\nUnited Nations is an active, dynamic institution, capable\r\nof confronting the major concerns of the world. In order\r\nto do this it must prove that, despite the sometimes\r\ndiscouraging complexity of the issues involved and the\r\noften divergent national interests of Member States, the\r\nOrganization is capable of working with determination,\r\ncreativity and effectiveness for the common good of all.\r\nThis is what we aspire to.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Japan, His Excellency Mr.\r\nMasahiko Koumura.\r\nMr. Koumura (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): I would like to extend\r\nmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nForeign Minister of the Republic of Namibia, on his\r\nassumption of the office of President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. I would also like to pay\r\nmy respects to Mr. Didier Opertti Badán, Foreign Minister\r\nof Uruguay, for all his efforts during his tenure as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. It is also\r\nmy great pleasure to welcome the admission of the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United Nations.\r\nPermit me on this occasion to extend my heartfelt\r\ncondolences and sympathy to the people of the Republic of\r\nTurkey and the people of Greece, who have suffered greatly\r\nas a result of the recent earthquakes in those countries. I\r\nalso express my deep concern regarding the grave damage\r\ncaused by the earthquake that occurred in Taiwan early in\r\nthe morning of 21 September, and extend my heartfelt\r\ncondolences and sympathy to those who have suffered from\r\nthe disaster.\r\nThis is the last session of the General Assembly\r\nbefore the Millennium Assembly is convened next year.\r\nDuring the one-year period to come, we must identify the\r\nissues, such as conflicts and poverty, which the\r\ninternational community will face in the twenty-first century\r\nand find an answer to what role the United Nations should\r\nplay in addressing these issues.\r\nSince its founding in 1945, the United Nations has\r\nbeen dealing with issues of world peace and security, as\r\nwell as economic and social issues, including development.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, during the cold-war era,\r\nthe ability of the Security Council to cope with conflicts\r\nwas severely restricted. Even under such circumstances,\r\nhowever, the United Nations made creative efforts, such as\r\npeacekeeping operations, and achieved certain results in the\r\nMiddle East and elsewhere. Since the end of the cold war,\r\nthe number of peacekeeping operations that has been\r\ndispatched has increased dramatically, and their mandates\r\nhave become diversified. Their activities bore fruit, for\r\nexample, in Cambodia and Mozambique.\r\nRegarding the issues of refugees and displaced persons\r\ncreated by conflicts, the humanitarian assistance activities\r\nof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) and others are highly appreciated. In\r\nthe economic and social area, the United Nations, along\r\nwith its specialized agencies, has raised issues, set standards\r\nand implemented those standards in every field, including\r\ndevelopment, the environment, human rights, science and\r\nculture. In the area of development, in addition to efforts\r\nundertaken through its programmes and funds, including the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations has achieved certain results in coordinating the\r\nassistance activities of the international community. The\r\nUnited Nations has, furthermore, played a decisive role in\r\nassessing the public opinion of global society. We should\r\nhold in high regard such efforts of the United Nations.\r\nFully recognizing the significance of the\r\nOrganization, the people of Japan regarded their country’s\r\nadmission to membership of the United Nations as their\r\ncountry’s reinstatement in international society after the\r\nSecond World War. They have been supporting and\r\ncontributing to the activities of the United Nations ever\r\nsince.\r\nThere is, however, still much to be done by the\r\nUnited Nations in such areas as the prevention and\r\nresolution of conflicts and poverty alleviation. It is also\r\nimportant to have fresh viewpoints, including that of\r\nhuman security, in addressing such new issues as those\r\nrelating to globalization and other global matters. These\r\nare the issues we will be passing along to the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nOne of the most important issues that the United\r\nNations must continue to address is conflict. In Africa,\r\nconflicts continue in many regions. Although peace has\r\nbeen restored in Kosovo, the conflict there left deep scars\r\non local communities in the region and on the hearts of\r\nthe people, demonstrating once again the importance of\r\nconflict prevention. Furthermore, numerous challenges\r\nexist on the path towards future reconstruction. There are\r\npersistent tensions in Asia. While various conflicts have\r\nbeen resolved in Latin America, there is still work to be\r\ndone to achieve stable post-conflict development,\r\nincluding the development of and the clearing of\r\nlandmines in the border region between Peru and\r\nEcuador, who reached a peace agreement on their border\r\ndispute last year.\r\nRegarding the efforts to deal with conflicts, I would\r\nlike to emphasize the following three points. First, it is\r\nimportant to take a comprehensive approach, which\r\nincludes conflict prevention and resolution, peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building, and the elimination of potential\r\ncauses of conflict, such as poverty. Secondly, it is\r\nnecessary to deal with conflicts in a manner that is\r\nsuitable to the situation in each region. These two points\r\nwere also made in the report of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled “The causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa”\r\n(A/52/871), which was issued last year. Thirdly, as\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nregards peace-building, it is necessary that international\r\nassistance, from post-conflict emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance to long-term development aid, be implemented\r\nseamlessly. In addition to these efforts, it has become\r\nimportant to ensure the security of personnel who are\r\nengaged in humanitarian or development assistance\r\nactivities.\r\nIn Africa, the United Nations is cooperating in efforts\r\nto bring peace in situations of conflict, such as in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone, and\r\nin the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Japan\r\nwill consider extending assistance to the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations as well as to the reconstruction efforts of\r\nthe countries concerned. We think that efforts to tackle\r\npoverty in Africa also contribute to the prevention of\r\nconflicts in the region.\r\nWith regard to Kosovo, Japan has provided the United\r\nNations Mission in Kosovo with personnel and is actively\r\nextending financial support in such areas as humanitarian\r\nand reconstruction assistance. It recently dispatched a study\r\nmission to explore possible concrete assistance projects.\r\nTurning our attention to Asia, we hope that security in\r\nEast Timor will be restored at the earliest possible date,\r\nthrough the activities of the multinational force working in\r\ncoordination with the Government of Indonesia and with\r\nthe Indonesian armed forces. This force is now starting to\r\nbe deployed on the basis of the Security Council resolution\r\nadopted on 15 September.\r\nJapan has already announced that it will extend a\r\nsubstantial financial contribution to the multinational force.\r\nIt is making this contribution with the intention of\r\nfacilitating the participation of developing countries in the\r\neffort. Japan will decide the amount of its contribution after\r\nthe whole picture of the multinational force becomes clear.\r\nThe situation of refugees and displaced persons in and\r\noutside East Timor causes serious concern. Japan has\r\nannounced the contribution of a total of $2 million to the\r\nactivities of UNHCR and the World Food Programme. In\r\naddition, it intends to positively consider further assistance\r\nafter taking into consideration a report from the\r\nGovernment mission now in the region, along with other\r\nfactors. Furthermore, Japan, in the medium and long term,\r\nalso intends to provide appropriate assistance for the\r\nreconstruction and development of East Timor.\r\nAs regards conflict prevention, I wish to commend the\r\nOrganization of African Unity for already launching efforts\r\nto establish an early warning system, and, as regards\r\nAsia, I would like to commend the ministerial meeting of\r\nthe Regional Forum of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations for its decision last July to discuss\r\nconcretely how preventive diplomacy might be dealt with.\r\nNext, I would like to touch upon three issues that are\r\ncommonly observed in regions in conflict: small arms,\r\nanti-personnel landmines, and refugees and displaced\r\npersons.\r\nIn its efforts to cope with the small arms issue,\r\nJapan strongly hopes that the General Assembly will\r\nadopt a resolution at this session promoting the\r\nrecommendations of the report of the Secretary-General\r\ndrafted by the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small\r\nArms. Japan looks forward to working with other\r\ncountries for the implementation of those\r\nrecommendations. Japan will also actively contribute to\r\nthe successful convening of the international conference\r\non small arms to be held by the end of 2001.\r\nOn the issue of anti-personnel landmines, with the\r\nentry into force last March of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, it is now necessary to achieve a universal\r\nand effective ban on anti-personnel landmines and to clear\r\nthe mine areas, while extending assistance to mine\r\nvictims, among whom are many children. Japan has\r\ncontributed financial assistance of more than $40 million\r\nto international and non-governmental organizations and\r\nwill continue to strive to achieve the goal of “zero\r\nvictims” at an early date.\r\nWith regard to the issue of refugees and displaced\r\npersons, Japan highly commends the activities of UNHCR\r\nand others and intends to continue to actively cooperate\r\nwith them.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, international efforts\r\nhave achieved certain results with respect to the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nincluding nuclear weapons, and their delivery vehicles —\r\nnamely, missiles — as well as arms reduction. Yet the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) regime has been challenged by the nuclear testing\r\nor secret development of weapons of mass destruction\r\nconducted by some States.\r\nJapan calls upon the nuclear-weapon and the non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States alike to take constructive actions\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nto ensure the successful convening of the Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the NPT next spring. Japan\r\nalso calls upon the States that have not yet done so to\r\npromptly sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty so that it can enter into force as soon as\r\npossible, and appeals to every country to respect the\r\nmoratorium on nuclear testing. Further, it is also important\r\nto reactivate the START process and promptly to\r\ncommence the negotiations on the fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty.\r\nJapan has consistently called for realistic measures for\r\nnuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Every year since\r\n1994, it has submitted to the General Assembly a resolution\r\non nuclear disarmament with a view to the ultimate\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. Late last July, the Tokyo\r\nForum on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament,\r\nwhich was established at Japan’s initiative, issued its report,\r\nwhich we believe provides a realistic guideline for progress\r\nin nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Japan would\r\nlike to consult actively with other countries with a view to\r\nimplementing the meaningful recommendations contained\r\nin the report.\r\nThe importance of addressing the issue of weapons of\r\nmass destruction other than nuclear weapons, such as\r\nbiological and chemical weapons, as well as the issue of\r\ndelivery vehicles, including missiles, is beyond discussion.\r\nIn particular, Japan will work towards the early conclusion\r\nof negotiations on the protocol to the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling\r\nof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\nTheir Destruction.\r\nWith regard to the North Korean missile issue, Japan\r\nappreciates and welcomes the important progress achieved\r\nin the recent United States-North Korea talks. Japan\r\nstrongly hopes that North Korea’s moratorium on missile\r\nlaunching is further assured.\r\nPoverty continues to be a serious issue in many\r\nregions of the world. There is a vicious cycle in which the\r\nfrequent occurrence of regional conflicts exacerbates the\r\nproblem of poverty, while poverty in turn causes the\r\noccurrence and recurrence of regional conflicts. Indeed,\r\npoverty should be recognized as the primary issue of the\r\ntwenty-first century, and it is incumbent upon various\r\nplayers, such as the United Nations, other international\r\norganizations, States and civil society, to cooperate towards\r\nits eradication.\r\nAt the Second Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development, which was co-organized by Japan,\r\nthe United Nations and others last October, the Tokyo\r\nAgenda for Action was adopted, which encourages\r\nAfrican countries to take initiatives on their own; calls for\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation between African\r\ncountries and developed countries as well as international\r\norganizations; and calls for the promotion of cooperation\r\nbetween Asia and Africa. Japan will remain actively\r\nengaged with the issue of poverty in Africa through\r\nfollow-up efforts for the implementation of the Agenda\r\nfor Action, such as the debt- management seminar which\r\nJapan co-organized with the United Nations and others\r\nlast month in Kenya.\r\nJapan has been the world’s largest donor of official\r\ndevelopment assistance since 1991. Despite the severity\r\nof its domestic budgetary situation, it will continue to\r\nextend effective, efficient and high-quality official\r\ndevelopment assistance and will tackle poverty problems\r\nthrough the further promotion of cooperation with the\r\nrelevant organizations of the United Nations.\r\nDebt problems are making it extremely difficult for\r\ndebtor nations, especially the poorest countries, to achieve\r\ndevelopment. Japan has provided assistance through debt\r\nrescheduling and grant aid for debt relief, and will take\r\ncomprehensive measures to deal with the debt problem,\r\nincluding the steady implementation of the commitment\r\nmade at the G-8 summit meeting in Cologne.\r\nImportant conferences, such as special sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly, are being held successively in the\r\nareas of economic and social development and human\r\nrights. The General Assembly’s special session on\r\npopulation and development was held this June, at which\r\nmeaningful proposals for future action were adopted. The\r\nsustainable development of small island developing States,\r\nwhich are susceptible to the effects of climate change and\r\nare also geographically vulnerable, is the very important\r\nsubject of the twenty-second special session to begin on\r\n27 September. The development of landlocked States,\r\nwhich are also geographically disadvantaged, is important\r\nas well.\r\nThe promotion of the implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action\r\nadopted at the World Summit for Social Development in\r\n1995 will be discussed next year at a follow-up special\r\nsession. The General Assembly special session entitled\r\n“Women 2000” will also be held next year in order to\r\nfurther promote the results of the 1995 Fourth World\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nConference on Women. Building upon the achievements of\r\nthese special sessions, Japan intends to contribute actively\r\nto international cooperative endeavours in these areas.\r\nThis is the final year of the International Decade for\r\nNatural Disaster Reduction. The international community\r\nmust take prompt and concerted action in responding to\r\nlarge-scale natural disasters, as clearly underscored by our\r\nexperience with the recent earthquakes in Turkey and\r\nGreece, last year’s hurricanes in Latin America and the\r\ntsunami in Papua New Guinea. The United Nations is\r\nrequired to play a more active role in this endeavour.\r\nMoreover, efforts in the area of natural-disaster reduction\r\nneed to be strengthened. Recognizing the importance of\r\nnatural disaster reduction in the context of development\r\npolicy and environmental issues, Japan will promote efforts\r\nin this field.\r\nWith regard to the advancement of globalization, while\r\ntaking advantage of the new opportunities it provides for\r\nthe revitalization of the world economy, the improvement\r\nin living standards, the creation of jobs, and development,\r\nwe must also address its negative effects, such as the\r\ngrowing instability in international finance and the widening\r\ngap between the rich and the poor. Japan is steadily\r\ncarrying out financial assistance measures totaling\r\napproximately $80 billion, including the New Miyazawa\r\nInitiative — by far the largest package of assistance\r\nprovided by one country — for the East Asian countries\r\nwhich were hard hit by the economic crisis. We strongly\r\nexpect the economic recovery of the region to resume and\r\nthat a sound and sustainable development of the world\r\neconomy will be achieved.\r\nWe are also concerned that globalization may\r\naggravate such problems as environmental destruction,\r\ninternational organized crime, drug, terrorism and the\r\nspread of infectious diseases. These global issues, which\r\ntranscend national borders and pose direct threats to each\r\nand every person, need to be dealt with by the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. It is necessary that we adopt\r\npolicies that give consideration to women, children and\r\nothers, who are most susceptible to the effect of these\r\nglobal issues.\r\nAlthough globalization also engenders creativity by\r\nfacilitating interaction among various cultures and different\r\nvalue systems, due consideration also needs to be paid to\r\nthe cultural diversity of the world. From this standpoint, we\r\nconsider that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization will play an even more important role\r\nin the coming century.\r\nJapan has been stressing the importance of\r\naddressing the various issues I have just mentioned by\r\nfocusing efforts on human security, that is, the protection\r\nof the dignity and life of every person against the many\r\nthreats posed, for example, by poverty; the outflow of\r\nrefugees; environmental issues; infectious diseases, such\r\nas AIDS; human rights violations; international organized\r\ncrime, including human and drug trafficking; conflicts;\r\nanti-personnel landmines and small arms; and terrorism.\r\nLast June Japan hosted the International Symposium\r\non Development, at which the issue of how to encourage\r\nthe self-reliance of individuals to escape from poverty\r\nwas discussed. On the initiative of Prime Minister\r\nObuchi, Japan established the Human Security Fund\r\nwithin the United Nations to support the activities of\r\ninternational organizations and to promote human\r\nsecurity. Japan recently announced its contribution of\r\n$100 million for reconstruction and assistance for the\r\nreturn of refugees in Kosovo, and it will implement that\r\nassistance through the Human Security Fund and other\r\nsources.\r\nIt cannot be said that the efforts of the United\r\nNations to address the issues that will confront the\r\ninternational community in the twenty-first century are\r\nsufficient. Nevertheless, it is not right to claim that the\r\nUnited Nations is incapable of addressing those issues\r\nadequately, and therefore disregard it. Neither is it right\r\nto simply deplore any attempt to disregard the\r\nOrganization. In as much as many issues today require\r\nefforts of the international community as a whole, and as\r\nthere is no other universal and comprehensive institution\r\nthat can replace the United Nations, our only recourse is\r\nto reform and strengthen the United Nations, so that it\r\nwill be capable of dealing with the issues adequately.\r\nFrom this viewpoint, I would like in particular to make\r\nthe following three points.\r\nThe first is the need for Security Council reform.\r\nDuring the 50 or so years since the end of the Second\r\nWorld War, the international situation has undergone\r\ndramatic changes. Given those changes, the functions of\r\nthe Security Council, as the body primarily responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nneed to be strengthened. Towards that end, it is essential\r\nthat the Security Council be re-created to reflect the\r\npresent international situation, with reform of the\r\ncomposition of both its permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership. Japan would like to assume greater\r\nresponsibilities as a permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nSecond, there is an urgent need for reforms to place\r\nthe United Nations on a sound financial base. It is\r\nnecessary for Member States to fulfil their obligation to pay\r\ntheir assessed contributions, and for the United Nations to\r\nwork to further control its budget. Despite the severe\r\neconomic and financial situations, Japan has been faithfully\r\nfulfilling its obligation to pay its assessed contribution and\r\nhas been making substantial contributions to the United\r\nNations and related organizations. However, as the Security\r\nCouncil reform has not been realized, and as the necessary\r\nbudgetary reforms have yet to be carried out, one cannot\r\nbut question the fairness of a situation in which Japan is\r\nexpected to pay an assessed contribution that exceeds the\r\nsum of the contributions made by four of the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, not including the United\r\nStates.\r\nThird, it is necessary for the United Nations to\r\nstrengthen its efforts in the economic and social area,\r\nincluding development. The Organization is expected to\r\nobtain the active participation of various actors in\r\naddressing problems in the economic and social area, and\r\neffectively coordinate their efforts. Japan attaches\r\nimportance to the role that the United Nations, especially\r\nthe Economic and Social Council, plays in this area, and is\r\ndetermined, if it is elected this year, to work as a member\r\nof the Council towards strengthening the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in such areas as the coordination between\r\nthe United Nations agencies, the promotion of dialogue\r\nwith Bretton Woods institutions and the broad participation\r\nby civil society in activities in this area, and coordination\r\nof these activities.\r\nWe have already devoted a significant amount of time\r\nto the discussion of United Nations reform. Today there is\r\na common recognition throughout the international\r\ncommunity that the reform of the United Nations is\r\nnecessary. Indeed, there is not a single country that is\r\nopposed to reform per se. Nevertheless, progress towards\r\nreform is far from satisfactory. The amount of time that has\r\nbeen expended in discussions so far tells of the difficulty\r\nthat lies in the way of reforming an organization. We must\r\nrecognize at the very core of our being that if we fail to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations through reforms, international\r\ntrust in the Organization will be undermined. This would\r\nnot only destroy the United Nations, but would be suicidal\r\nto all the Member States and the international community\r\nas a whole.\r\nThe Millennium Assembly and the Millennium\r\nSummit, scheduled for next year, will provide an occasion\r\non which the United Nations can demonstrate to the world\r\nthat it is capable of effectively tackling the issues that the\r\ninternational community will face in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The efforts which Member States make during\r\nthe one-year period to come could very well determine\r\nthe viability of the United Nations in the coming century.\r\nI would like, therefore, to conclude my remarks by calling\r\nupon all Member States to cooperate with each other in\r\npursuing the common interests of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Austria, Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Benita Ferrero-Waldner.\r\nMrs. Ferrero-Waldner (Austria): Mr. President,\r\nfirst let me congratulate you on your election to your high\r\noffice and assure you of the full cooperation and support\r\nof the Austrian delegation. I am convinced that we will\r\nhave a successful session of the General Assembly, the\r\nlast in this century, under your able guidance.\r\nAustria fully endorses the statement which was so\r\neloquently delivered by the Foreign Minister of Finland\r\non behalf of the European Union. I would like to add the\r\nfollowing observations to that very comprehensive\r\nstatement.\r\nThe United Nations in many ways finds itself at a\r\ncrossroads. The Organization has to find its role and\r\nstrengthen its relevance in an increasingly turbulent world.\r\nTo be sure, we are able to make progress on specific\r\nissues. But is that enough in the face of mounting global\r\nchallenges? Much has been said and written in the last\r\nfew years about globalization, and I believe we are all\r\naware of the speed and impact of this very dynamic\r\nprocess. What we still need is a coherent political\r\nresponse to this phenomenon. We have to meet the\r\nchallenges and make the best possible use of the\r\nopportunities presented to us.\r\nWhile our everyday work must be focused on\r\nreaching achievable goals within a realistic time, we must\r\nnever lose sight of our larger duty to provide human\r\nsecurity in its fullest sense. This means that we have to\r\nprovide individuals and communities with security,\r\ndignity and quality of life. We have to protect them\r\nagainst threats to their safety and well-being, such as\r\nconflict, discrimination, poverty, organized crime,\r\ncorruption or repression.\r\nIn recent years, a number of initiatives have been\r\nsuccessfully launched, in particular on landmines, small\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\narms and child soldiers. Austria is working very actively to\r\npromote the human security agenda, and I would like to\r\nhighlight three priority areas: human rights education, the\r\nfight against child pornography and the fight against what\r\nthe Secretary-General has aptly termed the uncivil society.\r\nOn the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the\r\npresence of the United Nations in Vienna next month, we\r\nwill organize a high-level meeting on these and other\r\naspects of human security.\r\nMost threats to human security have a human rights\r\ndimension. This is why a human rights security agenda\r\nmust include an overall strategy aimed at the strengthening\r\nof a worldwide human rights culture. Recent events in\r\nKosovo or East Timor have shown that the most basic\r\nrights cannot be taken for granted. Again and again we will\r\nhave to assert the universality and indivisibility of human\r\nrights. We therefore stress the importance of human rights\r\neducation, which is essential for the promotion and the\r\nachievement of stable and harmonious relations within\r\ncountries and among communities. We must redouble our\r\nefforts in support of the United Nations Decade for Human\r\nRights Education. Next year’s mid-term evaluation of\r\nprogress made in the Decade provides an ideal opportunity.\r\nInstitutions and organizations with specialized expertise in\r\nour countries should identify specific ideas for further\r\naction on human rights education activities at national level,\r\nin foreign policy, and in the context of development\r\ncooperation.\r\nEvery man and every woman must know his or her\r\nrights in order to become a full and equal member of\r\nsociety. People must be provided at the national and the\r\ninternational level with effective remedies for human rights\r\nviolations. We therefore welcome the successful conclusion\r\nof negotiations on the Optional Protocol to the Convention\r\non the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\r\nWomen. Its adoption by the General Assembly and its early\r\nentry into force will have great significance for women\r\naround the world.\r\nHuman security starts in the smallest entities of our\r\nsociety. The mutual learning process within families is one\r\nof human beings\u0027 most valuable experiences. The family, as\r\nthe fundamental unit of society and the natural environment\r\nfor the growth and well-being of all of its members, should\r\nbe afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that\r\nit can fully assume its responsibilities within the\r\ncommunity, because it is within the family, first and\r\nforemost, where children, the most vulnerable group in\r\nsociety, seek support and protection.\r\nMillions of children are being exploited worldwide.\r\nTheir basic human rights are being denied in many ways.\r\nFor some time now, and in particular during the Austrian\r\npresidency of the European Union, Vice-Chancellor and\r\nForeign Minister Schüssel has been trying to focus\r\nattention on one particular aspect: child pornography on\r\nthe Internet. Next week, Austria will host an international\r\nconference on combating child pornography on the\r\nInternet. Organized by Austria, the European Commission\r\nand the United States of America, the conference will\r\nbring together high-level officials from Ministries of the\r\nInterior and Justice, the judiciary and the police, experts\r\nfrom international organizations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and the industry, especially Internet service\r\nproviders. The United Nations system will be represented\r\nby experts from the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund and\r\nthe United Nations Centre for International Crime\r\nPrevention. The main objectives of the conference are to\r\nreinforce cooperation between law enforcement officials\r\nand the judiciary, establish codes of conduct for Internet\r\nservice providers and the further development of hotlines\r\nand networks between them. The results of this initiative\r\nwill be presented to the United Nations.\r\nThe fight against drugs and transnational organized\r\ncrime has rightly been accorded priority status in the\r\nwork of the United Nations. I am glad that the reform\r\nmeasures introduced by Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nhave reaffirmed Vienna\u0027s role as the United Nations\r\ncentre for fighting uncivil elements in society.\r\nAustria is particularly worried by reports about the\r\nsituation in Afghanistan, where the areas under poppy\r\ncultivation area apparently doubled in 1998. We are\r\ntherefore appealing to all partners to enhance their efforts\r\nin assisting the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) to combat the cultivation and\r\nproduction of drugs in that region and elsewhere. As a\r\npractical contribution to this effort, Austria will sponsor\r\na UNDCP training seminar for Central Asian drug\r\nauthorities this autumn. Austria strongly believes that drug\r\ncontrol is, above all, in the interests of our children and\r\nfuture generations.\r\nIn April 2000, the first United Nations conference in\r\nthe new millennium, the Tenth United Nations Congress\r\non the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of\r\nOffenders, will take place in Vienna. The key issues\r\ncontained in the preliminary draft of the Vienna\r\nDeclaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges\r\nof the Twenty-First Century (E/1999/30-E/CN.15/1999/12,\r\npara. 3), whose final forum will be adopted at the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nCongress, address the most burning questions in\r\ninternational crime prevention: trafficking in human beings,\r\nsmuggling migrants and illicit transfers of firearms.\r\nIn this context, I can say with satisfaction that the\r\nAustrian initiative to elaborate an international legal\r\ninstrument against the smuggling of migrants, which\r\nAustria presented to the General Assembly two years ago,\r\nhas gathered a great deal of support among United Nations\r\nMember States. Currently, intensive negotiations within the\r\nframework of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of\r\na Convention against Organized Transnational Crime are\r\nbeing held and will hopefully be concluded next year with\r\nthe adoption of a universal protocol against the smuggling\r\nof migrants.\r\nThe last of the series of world Conferences in the\r\n1990s showed that an innovative yet pragmatic approach\r\ncan work. This was the Third United Nations Conference\r\non the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space,\r\nUNISPACE III, which took place in Vienna in July this\r\nyear. The Conference focused on the question of how to\r\nensure that space technology will benefit humanity in the\r\ntwenty-first century and that it is used effectively to\r\npromote security in all its forms for the benefit of all\r\ncountries. It has provided developing countries with\r\nopportunities to define their needs for space applications for\r\ndevelopment purposes and to identify ways and possibilities\r\nfor them to participate in international programmes which\r\ndevelop these applications. UNISPACE III was both a\r\nnovel and a successful type of Conference in bringing\r\ntogether industry and academia, and young people, as equal\r\npartners and incorporating their insights into the final\r\ndocuments.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community will be judged by their capacity to\r\nprevent armed conflict. At a time when the world\u0027s\r\nproblems appear to be growing and the resources to tackle\r\nthose problems seem to be shrinking, we must be more\r\nstrategic than ever in devising new ways to approach these\r\nchallenges.\r\nAgain and again we have had to face the fact that the\r\ninternational community is not in the position to bridge the\r\ngap between early warning and early action. In future,\r\nefficient mechanisms will have to be implemented by\r\ninternational organizations in order to act at an early stage.\r\nIn our response to looming refugee crises, much faster\r\naction is needed to avoid human catastrophes like the ones\r\nwe have witnessed in Kosovo and East Timor.\r\nAs part of its development cooperation concept,\r\nAustria is currently working on a comprehensive strategy\r\nfor conflict prevention which combines all available\r\nmeasures, from facilitation and mediation to a targeted\r\nuse of the instruments of development cooperation.\r\nAustria is actively involved in the Arusha peace process\r\nfor Burundi and is offering a broad range of seminars and\r\ntraining programmes on preventive diplomacy, in\r\nparticular with its partners in Africa. Austria\u0027s\r\ndevelopment cooperation aims to promote both\r\nsustainable development and sustainable peace.\r\nAustria has always lent its active support to United\r\nNations efforts to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity. Since 1960, it has been one of the major\r\ncontributors to United Nations peacekeeping missions. At\r\nthe moment, more than 1,500 Austrian troops, civilian\r\npolice, military observers and civilian experts are serving\r\nin United Nations peacekeeping, and other United Nations\r\nmandated operations, and in missions in which regional\r\norganizations are participating — from Kosovo to East\r\nTimor, and from Western Sahara to Tajikistan. We will\r\ncontinue to do our utmost to assist the United Nations in\r\nits efforts to enhance stability in many areas of tension\r\naround the world.\r\nIf we are to cope with all these challenges, we\r\nclearly have to reinforce the rule of law in international\r\nrelations. A large part of the legal basis already exists.\r\nWhat is needed to make it work is our common political\r\nwill to monitor and to ensure its application. This can\r\nonly happen in the framework of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular through the Security Council.\r\nIn view of the United Nations primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of peace and security, it is crucial\r\nthat the United Nations prove its ability to act quickly and\r\ndecisively in conflict situations. The decisive action taken\r\nduring the Gulf war in 1990-1991 raised international\r\nhopes and expectations for the future.\r\nBut already during the terrible conflicts in the\r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, it took the Organization much longer to\r\nfind a successful crisis solution. It only managed to do so\r\nby applying a sensible subcontracting policy with regional\r\norganizations. The recent tragedies in Kosovo and East\r\nTimor have both brought the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council to the brink of being perceived in\r\ninternational public opinion as ineffective or unable to act.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nThe Security Council, which carries the primary\r\nresponsibility for international peace and security, must\r\nmaintain its ability to act. It cannot be seen to be driven by\r\nthe subjective interest of members rather than by an\r\nobjective assessment of real requirements. It goes without\r\nsaying that the permanent members bear a particular\r\nresponsibility in this regard, which includes financial\r\nobligations. The privileges of permanent membership come\r\nwith a heavy obligation: to act whenever necessary. If a\r\npeace operation has to be established, it must not matter\r\nwhether the conflict situation is located in an area of little\r\nstrategic interest or whether the country in question\r\nmaintains unwelcome relations with another entity. Its\r\nmandate and size must be based on the conditions on the\r\nground, and not depend on anybody’s willingness to finance\r\nit. Should the Security Council be seen to be unable to\r\nfulfil these functions, we will have to heed the call for\r\nreforms, including the role of its permanent members.\r\nOn East Timor, the Security Council has finally lived\r\nup to its special responsibilities assigned to it under the\r\nCharter. This proves that the international community must\r\nact decisively when confronted with massive violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights.\r\nAustria welcomes Security Council resolution 1264\r\n(1999) authorizing a multinational force for East Timor\r\nunder Chapter VII and the commitment of the Indonesian\r\nGovernment to cooperate with this force in the\r\nimplementation of the mandate. We hope that this initiative\r\nwill contribute to bringing about national reconciliation,\r\nlasting peace and respect for the will of the people of East\r\nTimor, expressed so clearly during the consultations on 30\r\nAugust 1999. Austria underlines the necessity to urgently\r\nprovide humanitarian assistance, and will also contribute to\r\nthese efforts.\r\nThe vote on the future of East Timor must be\r\nrespected by all sides. Austria, while underlining its desire\r\nto see a strong, democratic and united Indonesia, looks\r\nforward to recognizing East Timor once the process\r\ntowards independence is complete.\r\nAustria sharply condemns the atrocities committed in\r\nrecent weeks. Those who planned, authorized or executed\r\nthese acts must be held individually and personally\r\naccountable and be brought to justice.\r\nAfter a long impasse the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast is back on track. Austria greatly welcomes the\r\nmemorandum signed by Israel and the Palestinians at\r\nSharm el-Sheikh, which removes the obstacles to the\r\nimplementation of the Wye Agreement. Furthermore, we\r\nhave taken note with satisfaction that implementation on\r\nthe ground has already begun. Here I should especially\r\nlike to point to the handing over of territory, the release\r\nof Palestinian prisoners and the beginning of the final\r\nstatus negotiations. This clear commitment of the parties\r\nshould augur well for further speedy progress on the road\r\nto peace. Now it will also be necessary to bring about\r\nnew momentum in the Syrian/Lebanese track of the peace\r\nprocess by relaunching the negotiations between Israel,\r\nSyria and Lebanon. I think that all parties agree that\r\npeace and mutual understanding are the only viable option\r\nfor a prosperous future for all nations in the Middle East\r\nregion.\r\nThe western Balkans, being geographically so close\r\nto Austria, will remain in the foreground of Austrian\r\nforeign policy. The most burning problem is currently the\r\nsituation in Kosovo, which merits the joint attention of\r\nthe international community. I would like to commend the\r\nwork which has already been carried out by the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\r\n(UNMIK) and by KFOR, and the progress realized so far,\r\nin spite of such difficult circumstances. True, in the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999), and in our efforts to bring Kosovo back to\r\nnormalcy, there are delays and setbacks, in particular the\r\ninsecurity, the tensions in Kosovska Mitrovica, and the\r\nexodus of the majority of Kosovo Serbs and other\r\nnon-Albanians. Nevertheless, one must not forget the\r\nparamount importance of the Kosovo issue for the\r\nstability of the whole Balkan area, which is why we must\r\nnot become discouraged when we meet problems. Rather,\r\nwe have to understand them as an incentive to redouble\r\nour efforts. Yesterday’s demilitarization agreement\r\nbetween KFOR and the UCK is, I would say, a very\r\nencouraging step in the right direction.\r\nIn addition to setting up a functioning civil\r\nadministration, including police, creating a democratic\r\npolitical atmosphere respectful of human rights,\r\nrepatriating over 1 million refugees, and reconstructing\r\nthe infrastructure and the economic life of Kosovo, it is\r\nUNMIK’s crucial task to facilitate a political process\r\nleading to a definite status of the province. This is a very\r\ncomplicated endeavour, which requires sound and prudent\r\npreparation. We must not try to rush things, since it is\r\nclear that stability and reconciliation have to be\r\nestablished and solidified before we can tackle the final\r\nstatus question.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nThe same holds true for Montenegro. We must, and\r\nwe will continue to, support the Montenegrin reform\r\nprocess, and we must not allow forces in Belgrade to\r\nundercut those pluralistic and economic improvements. For\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a whole, we will\r\ncontinue to work towards democratization, political reform\r\nand respect for human and minority rights. Upon such\r\nchanges — which are not only urgently necessary but\r\nwhich are also yearned for by the Serb and Yugoslav\r\npeople — Yugoslavia should, and will, take its rightful\r\nplace in the international community.\r\nIn spite of some progress made by Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, it still needs and deserves our intense help —\r\nboth politically and financially. At the same time, it is\r\nincreasingly necessary for the Bosnians themselves to take\r\non more responsibility for their future and to start a process\r\nof decoupling themselves from dependency on international\r\nassistance.\r\nLet me emphasize at this juncture Austria’s strong\r\nbelief in the protection and promotion of minorities in\r\ngeneral. This attitude is based on historic experience and\r\nthe conviction that ethnic minorities constitute a true\r\nenrichment of our societies.\r\nIt is of interest for the international community to\r\nrecall that there are existing successful settlements of\r\nimportant minority issues in Europe. In particular, I think\r\nof the Austrian minority in the South Tyrol, which today\r\nenjoys a well-balanced autonomy on the basis of the Paris\r\nTreaty of 1946 between Austria and Italy. Time and again\r\nit has been noted that this formula could be an example for\r\nthe settlement of minority disputes in other parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nThough regional organizations and coalitions of the\r\nwilling have credibly shown their readiness to take on\r\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, the United Nations continues to provide the\r\nindispensable political, legal and institutional links to ensure\r\nthe acceptance, legitimacy and accountability of their\r\nrespective efforts.\r\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) plays a central role in promoting peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in the regional context, in particular\r\nthrough its broad range of activities in the area of conflict\r\nprevention, crisis management and post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation. The broad scope and complex nature of the\r\nsecurity challenges in the region requires a pluri-\r\ninstitutional response. But that implies also an effective\r\ncooperation among the institutions concerned. The OSCE,\r\nas a regional arrangement according to Chapter VIII of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, is closely cooperating\r\nwith the United Nations in many fields and regions, such\r\nas in Kosovo. In our capacity as the next Chairman-in-\r\nOffice of the OSCE, we will continue the efforts to\r\nstrengthen the relationship between the OSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations at both the political and field levels.\r\nLet me conclude by confirming Austria\u0027s strong\r\ncommitment to the United Nations. In a little less than\r\none year, our Heads of State or Government will\r\nparticipate in the millennium summit. I hope that this will\r\nbe the occasion to unlock the potential of the\r\nOrganization. We must use the wonderful tool of our\r\nOrganization as it was meant to be used: to ensure our\r\nsurvival on this planet in peace, freedom and dignity. On\r\nspaceship Earth the supplies are limited, so we have to\r\nmake the best possible use of them. Whatever our\r\ndifferences, we all know what needs to be done. Let us\r\nfind the political will to do it.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, His Excellency Mr. Borys\r\nTarasyuk.\r\nMr. Tarasyuk (Ukraine): Allow me first of all, Sir,\r\nto extend my most sincere congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to wish you every success in\r\ndischarging this extremely responsible mission. This\r\nelection is a well-deserved tribute to the personal qualities\r\nof the dean of African Foreign Ministers, as well as\r\nevidence of the indisputable authority your country enjoys\r\namong the members of the international community. The\r\nactive and responsible position of Namibia as a member\r\nof the Security Council serves as another confirmation\r\nthat the right choice was made by this General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to express our gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his effective\r\norganization of the work of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In addition, I have the pleasure to\r\ngreet three new United Nations Members — Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Ukraine\r\nsincerely welcomes them into our family.\r\nThe twentieth century will remain, in the history of\r\nmankind, as one of unprecedented ideological clashes,\r\nwith subsequent divisions of the world. The last 10 years,\r\nhowever, have been marked by an entente universelle to\r\nbuild this world on the basis of respect for cultural\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\ndiversity and universally recognized values. This\r\ntumultuous period of transition from bloc rivalry to\r\nrapprochement and cooperation obviously lacks stability and\r\nclear vision. That is why the role of the United Nations, a\r\nfirm anchor in these troubled waters, takes on increasing\r\nand immense importance for all of its Member States.\r\nI would like to place special emphasis on one\r\nfundamental factor that determines the significance of the\r\nUnited Nations and makes it universally meaningful. On the\r\neve of the twenty-first century, we have to admit that\r\nhumankind is still far from achieving the purposes\r\nproclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations. But at the\r\nsame time, we must recognize that this document, which\r\nhas withstood the test of time, has remained the most\r\nambitious yet most realistic code of world order for more\r\nthan half a century. There exists no alternative to the order\r\ndefined by the rules and principles of the United Nations,\r\nas no alternative exists to the Organization itself, which is\r\ndestined to be the centre for the coordinated actions of\r\nnations in achieving and maintaining such an order.\r\nThis vision of the Organization\u0027s significance to\r\ninternational life is what has prompted Ukraine to take an\r\nactive position in carrying out concerted efforts aimed at\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. Two years ago, we all\r\nwelcomed the programme of institutional reforms put\r\nforward by the Secretary-General, which were designed to\r\nadapt and update the Organization and to ensure its ability\r\nto promptly respond to the challenges of our time. That\r\npowerful start, however, dwindled to a slow pace, while our\r\ninitial optimism and our readiness to go ahead with the\r\nprogramme of reforms of the United Nations remained\r\nlargely unrealized.\r\nThis sort of criticism is all the more pertinent when it\r\ncomes to the reform of the principal United Nations organ\r\nentrusted with primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. For years, all of us seemed\r\nto be in agreement on the need to modernize the Security\r\nCouncil and replenish it with new energy and fresh ideas.\r\nI am confident that a new impetus should be given to the\r\nwork of the Working Group on Security Council reform to\r\nget the matter off the ground in the course of the current\r\nsession.\r\nWhat could our response be to the challenges that\r\nhave haunted humankind for the last 55 years? First, the\r\nmost important conclusion that we can draw from all of the\r\nUnited Nations deficiencies is this: for the Organization to\r\nmanage to unite nations around basic universal values, it\r\nmust have adequate tools to protect these values. Universal\r\nvalues must enjoy full support by means of legal,\r\npolitical, economic and military enforcement.\r\nSecondly, the age of confrontation is giving way to\r\nan age of cooperation. We should create a world order in\r\nwhich it would be in no one\u0027s self-interest to wage wars,\r\noppress national minorities or exert economic pressure on\r\nother nations. A broad and ramified system of regional\r\nand subregional cooperation would serve this purpose by\r\nupholding a universal code of conduct.\r\nIn this context, I wish to refer to the recent summit\r\nheld in the Ukrainian city of Yalta, called “Baltic-Black\r\nSea Cooperation: to the Integrated Europe of the 21st\r\nCentury Without Dividing Lines”. It would be no\r\nexaggeration to say that there is here an unavoidable\r\nparallel with Yalta 1945. That post-war summit was an\r\nexample of how three people decided the fate of the\r\nworld and divided Europe. Yalta 1999, on the contrary,\r\nwas evidence of how 22 neighbouring countries found\r\nsufficient motivation to resolve their problems together\r\nand be unanimous in determining their future in a United\r\nEurope.\r\nWe are particularly encouraged by the increased\r\nattention paid by the Security Council and the United\r\nNations in general to humanitarian issues. A major lesson\r\nlearned from the eruption of numerous local and regional\r\nconflicts is that there is an obvious and urgent need to\r\nrespond to the challenges posed by humanitarian crises\r\nand flagrant mass violations of human rights.\r\nThe primary role of the Security Council in\r\nmaintaining and restoring international peace must be\r\nreiterated. This role is expressed in the clear and proud\r\nlanguage of the Charter. The past and continuing\r\nexperience of the Council underscores the importance of\r\nthe adoption of a holistic approach that brings into\r\nprominence both security and humanitarian issues. As\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan imaginatively put it\r\nyesterday, a global era requires global engagement, and\r\nthe collective interest is the national interest.\r\nHow can this ambitious goal be achieved? An\r\nimportant step forward towards the goal of protecting\r\nhuman life and dignity is, of course, the ongoing process\r\nof establishing the International Criminal Court. Today, a\r\nyear after the remarkable conclusion of the Rome\r\nDiplomatic Conference, we are pleased to observe that the\r\nsignificance of the adoption of the Court’s Statute is\r\nwidely and rightly recognized as it relates not only to the\r\ncodification and progressive development of international\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nlaw but also to the system of international security in the\r\nnext century.\r\nIt is this perception of the nature and purposes of the\r\nfuture judicial institution that determines the position of the\r\nGovernment of Ukraine with regard to the signing of the\r\nRome Statute. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\ninform representatives that Ukraine intends to sign the\r\nStatute in the course of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nGuided by its belief that the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations should play a key role in conflict\r\nprevention, Ukraine was one of the first to come forward\r\nwith peace proposals during the initial stage of the Kosovo\r\ncrisis. The peace plan of President Kuchma of Ukraine\r\nproved to be realistic, since most of its provisions were\r\nconsonant with the provisions of Security Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999).\r\nFor years, Ukraine has been active in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. Last July, the President and the\r\nParliament of Ukraine decided to send an 800-strong\r\ncontingent from Ukraine to participate in KFOR. The\r\nUkrainian military have gained a very positive profile,\r\nmerited by their earlier service in the United Nations\r\nProtection Force, the Implementation Force and the\r\nStabilization Force in Bosnia. Their expertise and\r\ncontributions outweighed by far the financial costs entailed.\r\nWe fully recognize our share of responsibility in the\r\ncommon cause of restoring and strengthening peace in the\r\nBalkans.\r\nAt the same time, recent events in Kosovo and East\r\nTimor provide evidence that we should continue to increase\r\nthe level of security for peacekeepers. As a co-author of the\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated\r\nPersonnel, Ukraine appeals for the elaboration of further\r\npractical measures to implement its provisions.\r\nThe lesson of Kosovo proves that as long as human\r\nrights or the rights of national minorities and international\r\nlaw are ignored, the world will continue to be threatened by\r\nhumanitarian disasters. It is therefore necessary to pay\r\nspecial attention to regions with so-called frozen conflicts:\r\nareas with the potential for new outbursts of violence,\r\nrefugee flows and economic recession. As a guarantor of\r\npeaceful settlement in Transdniestria, Moldova, and an\r\nactive supporter of the peace process in Abkhazia, Georgia,\r\nand in Nagorny Karabakh, Azerbaijan, Ukraine is doing its\r\nutmost to translate the relevant agreements into real peace\r\nsettlements.\r\nJoint efforts are also necessary in post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation. Ukraine therefore welcomes both the idea\r\nand the adoption of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern\r\nEurope and is actively proposing specific projects in\r\ncooperation with its neighbours. The purpose of the Pact\r\nis not only to help reconstruct the Balkans but, most\r\nimportantly, to give those countries a clear perspective on\r\nEuropean integration.\r\nIntegration into European and Euro-Atlantic\r\nstructures remains the key priority of Ukraine’s foreign\r\npolicy. Membership in the family of European nations\r\nand sharing common values means economic growth,\r\nstable democratic development and the consolidation of\r\nthe European identity of Ukrainians. At the regional level,\r\nUkraine is an active participant in the Organization for\r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation, the Council of the\r\nBaltic Sea States, the Central European Initiative and the\r\nGUUAM forum, to which Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,\r\nAzerbaijan and Moldova belong.\r\nI have already mentioned the Yalta Conference and\r\nthe summit of the leaders of Baltic and Black Sea States.\r\nIn addition, last May Ukraine hosted a summit meeting of\r\neight Central European States. We are developing\r\nconfidence-building measures on a bilateral basis with our\r\nneighbours and in a multilateral framework to reduce\r\nnaval military activity in the Black Sea region. Pursuing\r\nthe line that intensive cooperation is the best remedy for\r\nconflicts, Ukraine is engaged in various trilateral\r\ncooperative agreements promoting free economic areas\r\nand transborder projects.\r\nAs one of the founders of the United Nations,\r\nUkraine continues to make its contribution to United\r\nNations efforts in strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity, the non-proliferation regime, disarmament and\r\narms control, crisis management, the promotion of\r\neconomic and social development, human rights and\r\nfreedoms and compliance with the fundamental principles\r\nof international law. By fostering internal harmony in\r\nsociety, creating an environment of stability and shaping\r\na vast network of regional cooperation, Ukraine is striving\r\nto make the fullest possible use of its rich experience and\r\nconstructive potential for the benefit of the whole\r\ninternational community.\r\nOver three years ago, Ukraine voluntarily renounced\r\nits nuclear stockpile — the third largest in the world —\r\nand it is strictly abiding by its commitments as a\r\nnon-nuclear State. We should multiply our efforts to\r\nenhance the efficiency and universality of the Treaty on\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In this\r\ncontext, it is of the utmost importance to break the\r\nstalemate in the preparatory process for the 2000 NPT\r\nReview Conference.\r\nUkraine has signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) and is now successfully completing\r\nlegislative procedures to fulfil its international obligations\r\nunder this Treaty. Last February, our country became a\r\nparty to the Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, while in March Ukraine’s Government\r\ndecided to prolong the moratorium on exports of all types\r\nof anti-personnel landmines.\r\nMy country is ready to participate in the development\r\nof collective measures to fight the proliferation of and\r\nillegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons. We\r\nsupport the initiative of Canada and the Netherlands to\r\nestablish an international regime for the control of light\r\nweapons and to start negotiations on working out a\r\nconvention on the prevention and combating of the illegal\r\ntransportation of firearms and light weapons.\r\nAware of the danger of the uncontrolled circulation\r\nand accumulation of conventional weapons, Ukraine strictly\r\nabides by Security Council and General Assembly\r\nresolutions imposing restrictions on international arms\r\ntrafficking. All of these factors explain Ukraine’s ambition\r\nto be elected as a non-permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil. Our ambition is particularly strong since it is our\r\nfirst bid for this seat as an independent State.\r\nIf elected, Ukraine would base its position in the\r\nSecurity Council on the following fundamental principles:\r\npaying adequate attention to conflicts and tense situations\r\nin different parts of the world, judging them by the real\r\nrequirements of each particular case; using all political and\r\ndiplomatic means available to the Security Council to\r\nprevent or manage conflicts; increasing the importance of\r\nthe humanitarian dimension among the Council’s priorities;\r\nand enhancing the ability of non-members of the Security\r\nCouncil to influence the decision-making process in that\r\nbody. In addition, there is a need to analyse the present\r\nmechanism of sanctions to ensure that their imposition is\r\nbalanced and well-grounded, in particular taking into\r\naccount eventual negative consequences for third countries.\r\nUkraine remains deeply concerned at the problems of\r\nAfrica. Our concerns are nurtured by the strong traditional\r\nties of friendship that unite Ukraine with African nations.\r\nOne could hardly disagree that Africa is a continent with\r\nunlimited potential for economic and social development.\r\nAt the same time, it is absolutely imperative that the\r\ninternational community take very concrete and effective\r\nsteps to assist African States in developing that potential\r\nand in responding to the challenges facing their continent.\r\nNowadays it is difficult to blame the United Nations\r\nfor the lack of attention to Africa. For example, at this\r\nvery moment, the members of the Security Council are\r\nresponding to a briefing on recent developments in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, given by the President\r\nof the Republic of Zambia, His Excellency Mr. Frederick\r\nChiluba. In just a few days, the Security Council will\r\nhold another meeting to reaffirm its commitment to the\r\ncause of peace and prosperity in Africa. I intend to\r\npresent my delegation\u0027s contribution to the deliberations\r\nof the Council, and will make more specific remarks on\r\nthis matter in the course of that meeting. At the same\r\ntime, Ukraine hopes that commitment to Africa on the\r\npart of the Security Council and the United Nations as a\r\nwhole will be reflected in concrete deeds that benefit\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East requires closer\r\nattention by the Security Council. We believe that the\r\nSecurity Council should send strong encouragement to all\r\nthe parties to the Middle East peace process. It is time to\r\ncome back to the negotiating table to find a final\r\ncompromise solution to the pending problems on the basis\r\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions. In that\r\ncontext, Ukraine welcomes the recent signing of the\r\nSharm el-Sheikh Memorandum on 4 September, brought\r\nabout thanks to the constructive approach of the new\r\nIsraeli Government and to the position taken by the\r\nPalestinian leadership.\r\nEast Timor continues to be a hot spot. Ukraine\r\nwelcomed the success of the 30 August 1999 popular\r\nconsultation of the East Timorese people, which was\r\npossible thanks to the constructive position taken by the\r\nGovernment of Indonesia and the active intermediary\r\nmission of the Secretary-General. Ukraine supported the\r\nSecurity Council\u0027s adoption of its resolution 1264 (1999),\r\nwhich authorized the establishment of a multinational\r\nforce pursuant to the request of the Government of\r\nIndonesia.\r\nThe past year has been marked by an unprecedented\r\noutbreak of terrorist acts in various parts of the world.\r\nWe are convinced that intensified international efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism need a more concentrated focus on the\r\nunderlying causes of this extremely acute international\r\nphenomenon, on its deep social roots and on relevant\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nhistorical conditions, as well as on situations that may give\r\nrise to international terrorism and endanger international\r\npeace and security. At the same time, whatever actions are\r\nundertaken at the international, regional or national levels,\r\nthey must all be in full conformity with the basic principles\r\nof international law and must not run counter to the\r\nfundamental provisions of the United Nations Charter.\r\nUnderdevelopment and impoverishment, the threat of\r\nmarginalization, the burden of external debt, a lack of\r\nresources, and ecological disasters pose a real threat to\r\ninternational peace and sustainable development.\r\nCircumstances such as the global financial crisis and the\r\nwar in Kosovo have considerably impeded economic\r\nprogress in many parts of the world. Ukraine has managed\r\nto curb its losses and maintain macroeconomic stabilization\r\nsince August 1998. On the other hand, the curtailment of\r\nnavigation on the Danube has paralysed economic the\r\nactivities of Ukrainian shipping companies, ports and\r\nenterprises. The total accumulated losses of Ukraine amount\r\ntoday to more than $300 million. Together with Romania,\r\nBulgaria and other interested parties, we are ready to clear\r\nthe waterway for the soonest possible resumption of\r\nnavigation as the best way to cope with the humanitarian\r\nhardships of Balkan peoples.\r\nSpeaking about global issues requiring joint efforts of\r\nthe international community, I must again emphasize the\r\nproblem of Chernobyl, which is so painful for Ukraine and\r\nfor its neighbours, Belarus and Russia. Our country is\r\nmeeting its commitments to decommission the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant as envisaged in the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding between the Government of Ukraine and\r\nGovernments of the Group of Seven and the European\r\nUnion. It therefore has every ground to expect the\r\nfulfilment by its partners of their obligations. We welcomed\r\nthe statement issued by the Group of Seven in Cologne last\r\nJune regarding the convening of a second pledging\r\nconference for the mobilization of financial resources to\r\nimplement the working plan on the transformation of the\r\nShelter facility into an ecologically safe system. We\r\nconsider this to be a confirmation by our partners of their\r\ncommitment to the memorandum of understanding.\r\nFrom this rostrum I call upon all potential donors to\r\ntake part in that conference and to make pledges to the\r\nChernobyl Shelter fund, to enable it to reach the required\r\namount of just $770 million. According to the Human\r\nDevelopment Report published by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, expenditures for cigarettes in\r\nEurope amounted to $50 billion in 1998 alone. Compared\r\nto this, the amount needed for Chernobyl looks like quite\r\na small price to save the environment of that vast region.\r\nThe present century gave the world so notable a\r\ndocument as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nStill, we have witnessed the most brutal and massive\r\nviolations of those rights. Famine, genocide, ethnic\r\ncleansing, torture and various forms of discrimination\r\ncontinue to haunt mankind. That is why the strengthening\r\nof international mechanisms to monitor human rights\r\nviolations is especially urgent today. The Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nshould play a leading role. Cases of the most massive\r\nviolations of human rights should be considered by the\r\nSecurity Council with a view to taking preventive or\r\ncoercive measures.\r\nHence, it is imperative to strengthen the role of\r\ninternational law in international relations in order to\r\nensure strict observance of the main norms and principles,\r\nfirst and foremost respect for sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Ukraine\r\ncontinues to support the International Court of Justice as\r\nthe Organization\u0027s principal legal institution.\r\nThe establishment of a world system that would\r\nguarantee peace and security, prosperity and sustainable\r\neconomic development, and the preservation of the\r\nenvironment for future generations requires decisive joint\r\naction by the international community. That process\r\nshould be led by a reformed and renewed United Nations,\r\nan organization with great experience and opportunities to\r\nsolve problems of global dimensions. For that purpose,\r\nthe General Assembly has approved a comprehensive\r\nprogramme for United Nations reform — by the way,\r\nunder the presidency of my predecessor Hennadiy Y.\r\nUdovenko, who is present in this Hall today. But while\r\ndebating it, we did not notice that two years had passed\r\nand that we were approaching the brink of the\r\nmillennium. The prominent Ukrainian philosopher of the\r\neighteenth century, Grigory Skovoroda, said that a waste\r\nof time is the heaviest of all losses. Let us bring to life\r\nwhat we have conceived for the benefit of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I call next on His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohamed Benaissa, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Morocco.\r\nMr. Benaissa (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): It gives\r\nme great pleasure to congratulate you, Mr. President, and\r\nthe sisterly country of Namibia on your election to chair\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nthe proceedings of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly. This choice is truly an honour for our continent\r\nand a tribute to your promising country. We are convinced\r\nthat under your leadership our work this year will be\r\nsuccessful, and this session will constructively result in the\r\nrealization of our expectations.\r\nI would also like to express appreciation and gratitude\r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, Foreign Minister of\r\nthe friendly country of Uruguay, for his excellent conduct\r\nof the work of the previous session.\r\nWe also welcome the new Member States that have\r\njoined our Organization: the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to thank the\r\nSecretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nhis admirable management of the Organization and for his\r\ncommendable efforts to infuse it with a new dynamism so\r\nthat its organs can fulfil our aspirations. He deserves our\r\nadmiration and appreciation.\r\nMany important events have marked this century to\r\nwhich we are about to bid farewell. They have led to a new\r\npolitical and economic balance of power and a modification\r\nof the international system. With the disintegration of\r\nborders, the evolution of means of communication and the\r\nspread of globalization in the financial and technological\r\nfields, the universality of the issues affecting mankind has\r\nbecome the most distinctive characteristic of international\r\nrelations, and the problems of the age have become too\r\ndifficult for individual countries to resolve.\r\nThe tragedies witnessed over the last few years,\r\nincluding ethnic cleansing and blatant defiance of the\r\nuniversal human conscience, call more than ever before for\r\npooling the efforts of the international community and\r\nconsolidating the role and the efficiency of the United\r\nNations, which is indeed the best-suited forum for settling\r\ninternational disputes. This would make it possible for the\r\nOrganization to fully shoulder its responsibilities and keep\r\nabreast of current challenges, while displaying a political\r\nwill that would enhance its credibility and strengthen its\r\nability to achieve its goals.\r\nAs regards the Security Council, current events on the\r\ninternational scene require that we reconsider its working\r\nmethods and its composition in order to enhance its\r\ncredibility, promote its ability to preserve international\r\npeace and security and ensure balanced representation in its\r\nmembership on the basis of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution.\r\nEconomic and social conditions in the world still\r\nrank high among the concerns of mankind. Indeed, as\r\nillustrated by widely divergent indicators between the\r\nNorth and the South, the world is suffering from a\r\nwidening gap in economic and social conditions and\r\nstrong disparities in human development. Those ever-\r\nincreasing disparities constitute a basic factor in the\r\ninstability that characterizes our world today. This\r\nimbalance has led to a proliferation of poverty in various\r\nparts of the world, as well as to the spread of illiteracy,\r\nunemployment and several other social ills that now\r\nthreaten world peace and security.\r\nWe recall with appreciation the distinguished role\r\nplayed by the United Nations, as it has developed over\r\nthe last few years a special interest in various economic\r\nand social development issues.\r\nMorocco is fully aware of the importance of social\r\ndevelopment as a fundamental means of achieving\r\ncomprehensive development. This awareness was the\r\ncornerstone of several pioneering initiatives taken by\r\nMorocco to overcome social problems, especially the\r\nplague of poverty. To that end, an institution known as\r\nthe Mohammed V Solidarity Foundation was set up, and\r\nis now under the supervision of His Majesty King\r\nMohammed, to fight poverty by mobilizing the active\r\ncomponents of civil society.\r\nIn keeping with its firm belief that individual and\r\ncollective prosperity cannot take place outside the\r\npurview of democracy and respect for human rights,\r\nMorocco has taken keen interest in the consolidation of\r\nhuman rights and democratic practices. Hence, Morocco\r\nhas undertaken some pioneering initiatives in the area of\r\npromoting human rights, disseminating a human rights\r\nculture, and protecting them against any violation or\r\ntransgression. It has enhanced the role of the various\r\ncomponents of civil society, including institutions that\r\npromote the role of women, in various political,\r\neconomic, social and cultural fields. Opting for the\r\nmultiparty system and democratic alternation of\r\ngovernment as a political system, Morocco has made\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms an individual and\r\na collective principle that is considered a strong pillar of\r\nthe Moroccan political system. This, in turn, has made it\r\npossible for Morocco to hold a distinguished position\r\namong the countries that have adopted democracy as a\r\nsystem and as a way of life.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nConvinced of the absolute necessity of coexistence\r\nwith its neighbours, in keeping with the strong historical\r\nties between Morocco and Spain, and given the desire of\r\nboth countries to further enhance their cooperation and\r\ngood neighbourliness, Morocco has been calling for the\r\nimplementation of the initiative of the late King Hassan II\r\naimed at setting up a joint Moroccan-Spanish working\r\ngroup to reach a final settlement of the current status of the\r\ntwo cities, Ceuta and Melilla, and the neighbouring islands,\r\nin a way that ensures Morocco’s sovereignty over those\r\nregions while guaranteeing Spain’s economic interests. We\r\ndo hope that the deep historical ties between the two\r\ncountries, the solid and privileged relations that exist\r\nbetween them, and the ambitions of both peoples to achieve\r\nfurther rapprochement and cooperation, will be a strong\r\nincentive towards reaching a final solution to this problem,\r\nsatisfactory to both parties.\r\nEver since their independence, Arab Maghreb\r\ncountries have believed in the inevitable necessity to\r\nachieve regional integration in order to counter the\r\nchallenges of development and to ensure the progress and\r\nprosperity of their peoples. In keeping with those\r\nobjectives, the Arab Maghreb Union was set up as a\r\nreflection of the region’s age-old shared history and an\r\nembodiment of its peoples’ unity of faith, language, history\r\nand common destiny. Given the blocs and groupings that\r\ncharacterize the world today and the challenges imposed by\r\nthe current economic situation, we believe that it is\r\nnecessary to pursue efforts to give fresh impetus to the\r\nArab Maghreb Union as well as a new dynamism to its\r\nvarious organs, while strengthening cooperation among its\r\nmembers so that it may discharge its mission by taking up\r\ndevelopment challenges and building an integrated Maghreb\r\neconomy.\r\nMorocco welcomes with deep satisfaction the positive\r\ndevelopments witnessed on the Lockerbie issue, which have\r\nled to the suspension of the sanctions imposed on the\r\nsisterly Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Because of its solidarity\r\nwith that country, a founding member of the Arab Maghreb\r\nUnion and one of the pioneering leaders among Arab and\r\nAfrican countries, Morocco notes with deep regret the long\r\nlasting hardships and the grave tragedy endured by the\r\nLibyan people due to the embargo imposed on them. We\r\nhope that sanctions applied to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\r\nwill be completely and definitively lifted as soon as\r\npossible, on the basis of the principles of justice and equity,\r\nand that the sisterly Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will resume its\r\nconstructive role, within the international community, for\r\nthe establishment of security, stability and peace.\r\nThe international community has followed with\r\nsatisfaction the beginning of a comprehensive settlement\r\nof the Middle East crisis. This has been achieved through\r\nvarious agreements reached by the parties concerned, the\r\nlatest being the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum. Those\r\naccords rekindled the hopes of the peoples of the region\r\nin building a new future based on security, stability and\r\ncoexistence. The agreements that have been signed —\r\nwhich are founded on the principle of land for peace —\r\nset the stage for a new era based on international law, as\r\nattested to by the commitments made by the parties\r\nconcerned. The accords uphold the right of all peoples of\r\nthe region to live in security and stability, and the right of\r\nthe Palestinian people in particular to exercise self-\r\ndetermination and to establish its independent State.\r\nThe brotherly Iraqi people have been suffering for\r\nyears from the impact of an economic embargo that has\r\nhad pernicious effects on them, especially children,\r\nwomen and the elderly. As it voices full solidarity with\r\nthe fraternal Iraqi people, Morocco calls for the pooling\r\nof international efforts in order to lift the embargo and to\r\nfind a peaceful settlement to this problem within the\r\nframework of international law and in compliance with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. In this respect, we stress the\r\nneed to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq, its security and\r\nits territorial integrity.\r\nSolving the many problems affecting Africa requires\r\nthat the international community seriously tackle the\r\neconomic and social conditions and the various conflicts\r\nthat beset most African countries, conditions that have\r\nhad a negative effect on the hopes of African peoples, as\r\nwell as on their legitimate right to achieve comprehensive\r\ndevelopment and to live under stable and safe conditions.\r\nBeing deeply committed to our ties of brotherhood\r\nand solidarity with all African countries, Morocco has\r\nconsistently placed African issues at the forefront of its\r\nconcerns. As a token of its unwavering solidarity with\r\nAfrican countries, Morocco devotes 95 per cent of its\r\nannual international assistance appropriations to African\r\ncountries.\r\nMorocco has followed with keen interest the\r\ninternational endeavours aimed at restoring peace in\r\nKosovo and at putting an end to the bloody conflict and\r\nethnic-cleansing campaigns that have claimed the lives of\r\nthousands of innocents Kosovars, in blatant violation of\r\ninternational law and of the most fundamental principles\r\nof human rights. Given its keen desire to strengthen peace\r\nin the region, Morocco has expressed its readiness to\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nparticipate in KFOR and has made all possible humanitarian\r\nefforts to provide material assistance to Kosovar refugees.\r\nTo this end, it also set up, at the initiative of Her Royal\r\nHighness Princess Lalla Meryem, a fund to collect\r\ndonations for Kosovar children.\r\nBecause of its geographical location, its historical ties\r\nand its economic and cultural relations with Mediterranean\r\ncountries, Morocco believes that the consolidation of\r\nsecurity and stability and the promotion of cooperation in\r\nthe region are an absolute necessity. Thus Morocco took\r\npart in the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, from the\r\nBarcelona conference to the Stuttgart conference, which\r\nprovided an opportunity to assess the Barcelona process\r\nthree years after its inception. During the Stuttgart\r\nconference Morocco voiced its conviction that for security\r\nand stability to prevail in the Mediterranean basin there has\r\nto be an effective partnership between the countries of the\r\nregion that takes into consideration the political, economic,\r\nsocial and cultural dimensions.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco has always taken a great\r\ninterest in the question of disarmament, because it is linked\r\nboth to international peace and security and to economic\r\nand social development. In this respect, we reiterate the\r\nneed to ensure that all the countries of the Middle East\r\nregion join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and submit their facilities to the safeguards\r\nsystem of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This\r\naction, along with making the Middle East region a nuclear-\r\nweapons-free zone, would be a decisive contribution to\r\nrestoring confidence and peace in that region.\r\nAs regards the question of the referendum in our\r\nsouthern desert provinces, Morocco reiterates its full\r\nsupport for the efforts of the United Nations, especially\r\nthose of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, aimed at\r\ncompleting the process as soon as possible and under\r\nconditions most conducive to transparency, justice and\r\nsuccess. As a contribution towards that objective, Morocco\r\nhas endeavoured, from the start of the process, to inform\r\nthe United Nations of any deviations that might affect the\r\nlegitimate rights of the potential participants in the\r\nreferendum. Thus, following the publication of the first part\r\nof the preliminary lists of the Sahraouis that have been\r\nidentified, Morocco expressed concern over practices that\r\nhave affected the identification process and have led to the\r\nelimination of thousands of names of people of Sahraoui\r\norigin, despite the fact that they had met the agreed criteria\r\nand conditions.\r\nIt is our dearest hope that the United Nations will\r\ncome up with equitable solutions that take into\r\nconsideration our concerns and those of thousands of\r\nSahraoui candidates who, had they not been compelled to\r\nleave the region because of the fight they were waging\r\nagainst colonialism, would have been covered by the\r\ncensus and therefore been accepted directly by the\r\nIdentification Commission.\r\nThe phenomenon of economic globalization has been\r\nswiftly developing and expanding. It has led to a\r\nliberalization of markets, swifter exchange relations,\r\nenhanced global productivity and greater financial flows.\r\nThe economic changes affecting the international arena\r\ncall for a comprehensive review of the rules of\r\ninternational economic interactions in order to adapt them\r\nto those changes and to the development needs of all of\r\nhumanity. This aspect was at the forefront of the concerns\r\nof His Majesty King Mohammed VI in the address he\r\ndelivered, when he was Crown Prince, on the occasion of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the multilateral trading system,\r\ncelebrated in Geneva in 1998. His Majesty pointed out\r\nthat\r\n“the comprehensive project advocated by the\r\nfounders of our system remains fragile because of\r\nthe fate of hundreds of millions of people who will\r\nnot accept indefinite marginalization while\r\ntremendous progress and prosperity are being\r\nenjoyed by the advanced countries of the world.”\r\nIn future negotiations, and within the framework of\r\nthe World Trade Organization, Morocco is of the view\r\nthat the adoption of a global and balanced approach\r\nreflecting the legitimate interests of all countries, while\r\ntaking into account the developmental dimension of\r\nadvanced countries, should be the best means to achieve\r\na just and balanced international trade system. Morocco\r\nbelieves that effective solutions to the debt problem\r\nshould not be restricted to partial alleviation of the debt\r\nburden of some countries only, but should, rather, take\r\nthe form of a comprehensive policy to stimulate the\r\neconomic activity of debt-ridden developing countries\r\nthrough promoting their exports and encouraging direct\r\nforeign investments in them.\r\nFollowing the ninth ministerial meeting of the Group\r\nof 77 and China — which I had the honour of chairing\r\nand which was held in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 13 to\r\n16 September 1999, in preparation for the tenth session of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nDevelopment — the Group of 77 and China adopted the\r\nMarrakesh Declaration, which pointed out that\r\n“the disparities in the scope and impact of\r\nglobalization have led to economic disharmony, both\r\nat the international and national levels. This translates\r\ninto new challenges to our development ambitions.\r\nMany developing countries are facing difficulties in\r\ntheir attempts to effectively integrate with the world\r\neconomy and are suffering the consequences of\r\nglobalization.”\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that, as we stand on the\r\nthreshold of the new millennium, the international\r\ncommunity should exert greater efforts to create a political,\r\neconomic and social environment conducive to further\r\ncooperation and rapprochement among peoples, so that all\r\nof mankind can enjoy the fruits of peace and live in\r\nprosperity and tranquility.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uzbekistan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdulaziz Kamilov, to whom I give the floor.\r\nMr. Kamilov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian): In my\r\nstatement, I should like to dwell on those questions, which,\r\nin our opinion, demand special attention. First among these\r\nis the issue of security and the maintenance of regional and\r\nglobal stability.\r\nToday, we are forced to recognize that terrorism is one\r\nof the principal challenges and threats to international\r\nsecurity and stability in the twentieth century. Should the\r\nUnited Nations react to this most daunting challenge? Yes.\r\nThe coordination of the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity in the search for legal mechanisms to fight\r\nterrorism at the global level has become urgent. The\r\nstruggle against terrorism transcends the problems of one\r\ncountry or even groups of countries. I take this opportunity\r\nto emphasize in particular the serious threat of terrorism\r\nfacing the States of Central Asia. In this respect, I wish to\r\nsay the following.\r\nFirst, terrorists, using Islam — one of the world’s\r\nmost peaceful religions, founded on the greatest cultures of\r\ncivilization — as a cover, are seeking to attain the broadest\r\nof political goals: the creation of a new regional and\r\nultimately global order. The terrorists’ methods of\r\nassassinating peaceful civilians and creating diversions\r\nradically contradict the principles and values of Islam.\r\nSecondly, terrorism is undergoing an intensive\r\nprocess of internationalization. Extremists working in\r\nCentral Asia are consolidating their ranks with recruits\r\nfrom throughout the world. Terrorism has neither\r\nnationality, borders nor any particular belief. Attempts to\r\ngive terrorism, and international terrorism in particular, a\r\nnational or ethnic character do not reflect reality and have\r\ntheir own dangerous consequences.\r\nThirdly, the fight against terrorism requires\r\ncoordinated international efforts and wide recognition of\r\nthe legitimate rights of States to protect their citizens\r\nfrom terrorist assaults. Terrorists casually and most\r\ninsolently attack peaceful populations and deprive human\r\nbeings of their fundamental right to life.\r\nFourthly, the global danger of terrorism is obvious\r\ntoday. There is an understanding at the international level\r\nof the need for coordinated action. At the same time, we\r\ndo not fully understand the rather subdued reaction of the\r\ninternational community and the major States to the most\r\ndangerous spread of terrorism in Central Asia, posing the\r\nthreat of regional and global destabilization.\r\nFinally, the contemporary wellsprings of terrorism,\r\nwhere it is born and nurtured, are the theatres of military\r\nconflict. In our region, that means Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Ingólfsson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nA working meeting of the “six plus two” group in\r\nthe special format, with the participation of\r\nrepresentatives of the two main parties to the Afghan\r\nconflict, was held in Tashkent two month ago. The\r\ndiscussion resulted in the signing of the Tashkent\r\nDeclaration, defining the fundamental principles for the\r\npeaceful settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan.\r\nUzbekistan supports increased international efforts to\r\nfurther assist the stabilization of the situation in Tajikistan\r\nand the rapid elimination of new hotbeds of tension in\r\nsouthern Kyrgyzstan, which has become a new target for\r\ninvasion by international terrorists and extremist forces.\r\nIn this regard, I would propose the adoption of a\r\nresolution by the General Assembly to consider the\r\nproblem of terrorism in the framework of the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as the establishment of an informal\r\ngroup to coordinate efforts aimed at fighting terrorism and\r\nextremist crimes. We also support the proposal to\r\nconvene an international conference on the fight against\r\nterrorism. We believe that the international community, in\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\npreparing for the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000,\r\nshould show its determination by defining extremist crimes\r\nand drafting its explicit understanding of the threat of\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan is recognized around the\r\nworld as an authoritative supporter of the non-proliferation\r\nof the nuclear weapons. Uzbekistan is party to the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the\r\nConvention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The\r\nRepublic was among first countries to sign an Additional\r\nProtocol to its agreement with the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency on the application of safeguards in\r\nconnection with the NPT. These actions revealed not only\r\na deep understanding of the importance of these\r\ninternational documents, but also our desire to make a real\r\ncontribution to solving the problem of the non-proliferation\r\nof nuclear weapons, improving the planet’s ecology and\r\nstrengthening global security and regional stability.\r\nThe issue of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is\r\nfirmly established on the disarmament agenda. It is already\r\nwidely recognized that the creation of such zones is a\r\nunique instrument in the process of nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament, which undoubtedly\r\nstrengthens international and regional peace and security.\r\nLet me express the conviction that this topic will be\r\nconsidered as one of the major issues in the work of the\r\n2000 NPT Review Conference. The value of this step is of\r\nspecial importance in the light of nuclear testing in South\r\nAsia and the clear tendency towards a global arms race.\r\nSubstantial progress has been achieved towards the\r\nrealization of the Central Asian initiative to establish a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. The Central Asian countries,\r\nthrough their common efforts and with the support of the\r\nUnited Nations, have come considerably closer to\r\nconcluding a treaty on the establishment of a Central Asian\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. I hope that, at the meeting to\r\nprepare the draft treaty to be held in Japan in few days, the\r\nexperts of the Central Asian countries will be able to\r\nfinalize the draft.\r\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan supports the measures\r\nproposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to reform the\r\nUnited Nations. The implementation of the reform\r\nprogramme will go a long way towards adapting the United\r\nNations to the demands of the modern world. The\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to convene the Millennium\r\nAssembly and the Millennium Summit in the year 2000\r\nmust be implemented. The year 2000 is a unique symbolic\r\nmoment to affirm the position of the United Nations and\r\nto strengthen its role as a leading force in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan continues to consider\r\nSecurity Council reform to be a necessary and urgent\r\nprocess. Any delay in this process will prevent the United\r\nNations from adapting efficiently to the dynamics of the\r\ncoming millennium. We are convinced that Germany and\r\nJapan can rightly claim permanent membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. We are also in favour of an increase in\r\nthe number of new non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe deteriorating problem of the Aral Sea requires\r\nme once again to call on the Assembly for support. With\r\nthe help of international organizations, the opinion that\r\nthe Aral Sea crisis can be resolved only through\r\nhumanitarian intervention has gradually taken root in the\r\nperception of the international community. But this is not\r\nthe case.\r\nMeasures of this kind have not given positive results\r\non any continent where mankind has been faced with\r\necological catastrophes. In this connection, it is necessary\r\nto develop and implement, with the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies and donors, a\r\nspecific, long-term strategy and programme of\r\nrevitalization for the Aral area, that would affirm the\r\nprinciples of sustainable development, prevent a\r\ndeterioration of quality of life for people living in the\r\nregion and ensure a dignified standard of living for future\r\ngenerations.\r\nWe are hoping for the effective support of such\r\ninternational financial and economic institutions as the\r\nWorld Bank, the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) and others, as well as donor countries, in the\r\nnormalization of the ecological situation and in meeting\r\nthe pressing needs of the population living in the affected\r\narea. The problem of Aral Sea can be solved only with\r\nthe help of an adjusted financing mechanism and the\r\nconscientious work of experts.\r\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan comprehensively\r\nsupports efforts of the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community aimed at counteracting the illegal\r\ncultivation, transportation and consumption of narcotic\r\nsubstances. The problem of drugs should be considered a\r\ndanger in that it gives rise to terrorism, international\r\ncrime and money-laundering.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nThe illegal sale of drugs is the most profitable shady\r\nactivity in the modern world. The transnational structures\r\ncontrolling global trade in drugs appear in most cases to be\r\nmore mobile than the structures opposing them. Today, as\r\nhas been pointed out by previous speakers, more than 90\r\nper cent of the drugs in some European countries are of\r\nAfghan origin.\r\nAccording to a 1998 annual report on international\r\ndrug control, starting in 1995 Uzbek customs employees\r\nhalted the attempted illegal export from Europe to\r\nAfghanistan of 72 tons of raw chemical material used for\r\nheroin manufacturing. This reaffirms the conclusion about\r\nthe internationalization of the narcotic business and the\r\nemergence of international terrorism, which is no less\r\ndangerous.\r\nDuring the twentieth special session of the General\r\nAssembly, devoted to the fight against the illegal\r\nmanufacturing, sale, purchase, transport, trafficking and\r\nspread of narcotic substances, we advanced many concrete\r\nproposals, including the establishment of a regional\r\ncoordination centre to fight drug-trafficking and the drug\r\nbusiness. Concrete forms of cooperation between Central\r\nAsian countries and the European Union were defined.\r\nWe call for more work by the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) in the\r\nregion of Central Asia. The conclusions of experts show\r\nthat the Central Asian region is considered by the criminal\r\nworld an important transit area for the transport of drugs to\r\nEurope and North America.\r\nSpecific UNDCP projects aimed at the development of\r\ntechnical possibilities to control the transit of goods by\r\nproviding border services with up-to-date methods of drug\r\ndetection could contribute to this fight, which can hardly be\r\nregarded as the problem of one region alone. In this regard,\r\nwe welcome the establishment, on the initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General, of the United Nations Office on Drug\r\nControl and Crime Prevention’s regional office operating in\r\nUzbekistan.\r\nThe process of democratization is long and\r\ncomplicated, especially if it runs parallel to large, extensive\r\neconomic reforms. However, the real threat to democracy,\r\nsecurity and stability in the region stems from the sphere of\r\ntransnational crime. In this respect, we state our firm\r\nsupport for the work of the Commission on Crime\r\nPrevention and Criminal Justice.\r\nFor this reason, the Republic of Uzbekistan has\r\nexpressed its intention to present its candidature for\r\nmembership of the United Nations Commission on Crime\r\nPrevention and Criminal Justice for the period of\r\n2001-2004. We hope that the tenth United Nations\r\nCongress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of\r\nOffenders, to be held from 10 to 17 April 2000, in\r\nVienna, will be devoted to the search for answers to the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, as indicated in a\r\nnumber of its main topics.\r\nWe would like to focus on the work of UNDP in\r\nUzbekistan. As the largest United Nations programme\r\nrendering assistance to developing countries in their\r\nprocess of development, UNDP, together with the\r\nGovernment of Uzbekistan, is carrying out a number of\r\nuseful projects. We hope that such cooperation will be\r\ncontinued in the future as well.\r\nNevertheless, I would like to say a few words about\r\none problem that has emerged in our cooperation with\r\nUNDP and that, in our view, must be explained. The\r\nproposed regional UNDP Programme for development of\r\nthe Fergana Valley has not received the support of our\r\nGovernment. In our opinion, the substance of the project\r\nhas not been sufficiently considered and could entail\r\nnegative consequences.\r\nDespite the exhaustive and comprehensive\r\nsubstantiation by our Government of the unacceptability\r\nof this project, which interferes with the security of the\r\nregion, attempts to involve our country in the participation\r\nof the programme by distributing erroneous information\r\nthroughout the international community have been\r\nundertaken during the last three years by UNDP and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nWe sincerely hope that the new UNDP\r\nAdministrator, Mr. Brown, will take note of Uzbekistan’s\r\nassessments. At the same time, we note with satisfaction\r\nthe new style of work at the UNDP mission in\r\nUzbekistan, which was recently headed by Mr. Kral.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to the book written by\r\nthe President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Islam A. Karimov, Uzbekistan at the\r\nThreshold of the Twenty-first Century: Threats to\r\nSecurity, Conditions and Guarantees of Progress, which\r\nsays,\r\n“As we enter the new millennium, we extend to\r\neveryone the hand of friendship and mutual\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nunderstanding, symbolizing this with the words\r\nsecurity, stability and sustainability of growth and\r\ndevelopment. For we believe that the realities these\r\nwords signify constitute the most solid foundation for\r\nglobal geopolitical balance, and for the peace,\r\nprosperity and well-being of every individual country,\r\nwhich will enable every human being to face the\r\nfuture with confidence”.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Sweden, Her Excellency Ms. Anna\r\nLindh.\r\nMs. Lindh (Sweden): The past year has been a\r\ndifficult one for the United Nations. Its principles have\r\nbeen challenged. Its relevance has been questioned. Still, at\r\nthe end of the millennium, we have proved ourselves\r\nunable to prevent war between Ethiopia and Eritrea and\r\nunable to prevent genocide in Rwanda or ethnic cleansing\r\nin Kosovo. Still, we see flagrant disrespect for international\r\nlaw, humanitarian law and human rights. Children are used\r\nas soldiers in Sierra Leone, women are denied all rights in\r\nAfghanistan, fundamentalist forces have demonstrating\r\nstudents arrested and possibly sentenced to death in Iran.\r\nOther tragic examples can be found in almost all parts of\r\nthe world.\r\nWe can change all that, if only there is political will.\r\nIt is up to us, the Member States, to ensure that the United\r\nNations and the Security Council are able to uphold\r\ninternational law and their responsibility for international\r\npeace and security.\r\nI would like to highlight four key areas that we, the\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States, need to address to\r\nmake the United Nations truly relevant: the questions of\r\nintervention; early action and prevention; nuclear\r\ndisarmament; and human rights. To succeed, the United\r\nNations system also needs to be reformed, and I will come\r\nback to that.\r\nWhen it comes to intervention to secure peace,\r\nregional organizations and arrangements, as well as so-\r\ncalled coalitions of the willing, can have important roles,\r\ntogether with the United Nations, as we have just seen in\r\nEast Timor. But it is for the Security Council to provide the\r\nlegal foundation — the mandate — for such action, in\r\nparticular when force has to be used. Without such a legal\r\nfoundation, we run the risk of anarchy in international\r\nrelations, and in fact we undermine the prospects for peace\r\nand security; and that long-term perspective must never be\r\nlost.\r\nOur responsibility for international peace and\r\nsecurity implies that necessary action by the Security\r\nCouncil should not be hindered by a veto. If the Security\r\nCouncil in an urgent situation is paralysed by a veto or a\r\nthreat of veto, this may undermine the authority and the\r\nrelevance of the United Nations itself. It also presents the\r\ninternational community with a difficult dilemma.\r\nWhen human life is threatened on a massive scale,\r\nit is not possible to remain passive. Humanitarian\r\nintervention has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in\r\nview of the values at stake and whether all other means\r\nhave been exhausted. The effects on international law and\r\ninternational security at large have to be considered as\r\nwell.\r\nAs the Secretary-General said yesterday, we must\r\nensure that the Security Council is able to rise to the\r\nchallenge. It must negotiate in earnest, with creativity and\r\nwithout the threat of veto, to define threats to peace and\r\nsecurity at an early stage, and to deal with a crisis before\r\nan emergency situation arises. Council action does not\r\nnecessarily mean the use of force. The use of force\r\nalmost inevitably causes suffering for the innocent. It\r\nshould, therefore, only be the last resort. There are many\r\nother tools available. The United Nations Charter offers\r\nseveral options.\r\nThe most obvious alternative to the use of force is\r\nconflict prevention and early action. Member States, in\r\nparticular the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil, must share information on conflict situations and\r\nearly warning signals with the Secretariat. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be invited to react to such reports and to\r\npropose appropriate and timely action to the Security\r\nCouncil. The United Nations offices in the field and early\r\nfact-finding missions dispatched to areas of potential\r\nconflict could help the Secretary-General formulate such\r\nproposals. Academic institutions and non-governmental\r\norganizations could also be helpful in this regard.\r\nThe Swedish Government has adopted a programme\r\nof action to facilitate and contribute to the prevention of\r\narmed conflict. It is our hope that this action plan will\r\nstimulate a debate on how to change the focus from crisis\r\nmanagement to early preventive action in order to\r\npromote a culture of prevention.\r\nWhen considering peacekeeping operations, the\r\nSecurity Council should not be hampered by short-term\r\nbudgetary considerations. This sends a very negative\r\nmessage and runs counter to the need for early and\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\npreventive action. All countries must pay their assessed\r\ncontributions in full, on time and without conditions.\r\nNaturally, that also goes for the host country. The United\r\nNations must be given the necessary resources to be able to\r\nact swiftly upon decisions by the Security Council.\r\nThe danger of nuclear devastation has not faded. On\r\nthe contrary, we are faced with new threats. Last year the\r\npositive trend set by Argentina, Brazil and South Africa\r\nhaving joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) was reversed by India and\r\nPakistan, which both tested nuclear weapons. Their actions\r\nhave endangered international peace and security, as well\r\nas stability in the region, and are a serious setback to our\r\nhopes for a world without nuclear weapons.\r\nSweden will follow up its call of last year for a new\r\nagenda for complete nuclear disarmament. India and\r\nPakistan have taken us further away from that goal. We call\r\nupon them, and all other States which have not yet done so,\r\nto give up their nuclear ambitions. All countries should\r\nbecome parties to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT) and the NPT.\r\nThe five nuclear-weapon States also have a\r\nresponsibility to complete nuclear disarmament.\r\nDeployment of national missile defence systems in the\r\nfuture would create uncertainties and have a negative\r\nimpact on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We\r\nencourage the United States and Russia to re-establish a\r\nnew momentum in the stalled START negotiations, and\r\nespecially we call upon Russia to ratify the Start II\r\nagreement without further delay. Reductions should be\r\nextended to non-strategic nuclear weapons. Furthermore, we\r\nurge the three nuclear-weapon States which have not yet\r\ndone so to ratify the CTBT. All this should be done in an\r\neffort aimed at the elimination of all kinds of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, which still pose a threat to human beings\r\nall over the world.\r\nAny regime violating human rights paves the way for\r\ncrisis and armed conflict. The defence of human rights is a\r\nlegitimate concern for the Security Council and the\r\ninternational community. It is our duty to react when the\r\nrights of individuals are violated, wherever it happens.\r\nStill, disrespect for democracy and human rights is\r\nobvious in many parts of the world. The events in East\r\nTimor show how the will of the people can be totally\r\nignored by armed thugs. In Kosovo, innocent civilians are\r\nattacked for belonging to a certain ethnic group.\r\nStill, poverty and social injustice deprive people of\r\nhealth and education.\r\nStill, women and girls are facing discrimination. The\r\nbrutalizing and killing of women is carried out with\r\nimpunity in many countries. In wars, rape is used as a\r\nmeans of terror. Often women are deprived of their right\r\nto earn their own living or participate in the economic\r\nand political life of their countries. I urge all countries to\r\nadhere to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\r\nof Discrimination against Women, without reservation.\r\nStill, 10 years after the adoption of the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child, the hopes of children for the\r\nfuture are overshadowed by daily hardship and fear. Too\r\noften their talents and skills are buried in poverty or\r\ndiseases which are curable but not attended to. Too often\r\nthey are denied proper education, or suffer from\r\ndiscriminatory school systems. The recruitment of child\r\nsoldiers is a shameful practice that causes individual\r\nsuffering and will harm the security and development of\r\nsocieties for many years to come. I appeal to all\r\nGovernments to assist in the conclusion of the two\r\noptional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild in order to prohibit sexual abuse of children and the\r\nuse of children below the age of 18 in armed conflict.\r\nThe use of the death penalty has no place in a\r\ncivilized society. Sweden welcomes moves taken in a\r\nnumber of countries to put an end to this repugnant\r\npractice. The abolition of the death penalty would\r\nenhance human dignity worldwide.\r\nStill, the ugly face of racism appears in all parts of\r\nthe world. Manifestations of racism are an affront to the\r\nfundamental principle of non-discrimination and a threat\r\nto the fragile fabric of peaceful relations between people\r\nin an increasingly global community. The preparations for\r\nthe World Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\r\nprovide an important opportunity to identify concrete and\r\naction-oriented ways to combat racism. Another important\r\nmanifestation will be the Stockholm International Forum\r\non the Holocaust, to be held in January 2000.\r\nThe early entry into force of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court would send a clear signal\r\nthat the international community is determined to end the\r\nculture of impunity for the most heinous crimes under\r\ninternational law. Sweden is committed to early\r\nratification, and we urge all countries to be similarly\r\ncommitted.\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nAs I said at the outset, in order to have an efficient\r\nand relevant United Nations, not paralysed by the veto and\r\nable to cope with the challenges of conflict prevention,\r\nnuclear disarmament and the protection of human rights, we\r\nalso need reforms. In particular, we need to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations capacity for conflict prevention and to\r\naddress root causes of conflict. This is a moral imperative\r\nas well as a humanitarian, political and economic necessity.\r\nThe Security Council should be enlarged to better\r\nreflect the realities of today’s international relations. A\r\ngeographical balance is important in this regard so that the\r\nCouncil can become truly representative of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe use of the veto, or even the threat of its use,\r\nhampers the work of the Council. We support the proposal\r\nthat as a first step the right of veto should be limited to\r\ndecisions on enforcement action under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter. We would also like to see the five permanent\r\nmembers agreeing on a moratorium on the use of the veto.\r\nThe Security Council should be more transparent and\r\nopen. This would contribute to the acceptance and\r\nlegitimacy of its decisions. The Council should be able to\r\nhear the views of all relevant parties to a conflict without\r\nthe implication of political recognition.\r\nThe involvement of humanitarian organizations in the\r\nCouncil’s deliberations would enhance the quality of its\r\ndecisions. The humanitarian consequences of Security\r\nCouncil action should always be taken into consideration.\r\nThis is particularly important when sanctions are imposed.\r\nSweden welcomes the Secretary-General’s efforts to\r\nreform the Secretariat and modernize its management\r\nculture, and we appreciate the improved efficiency that has\r\nfollowed. Reform is not only about cost-cutting. The aim\r\nmust be to revitalize the Organization and the multilateral\r\nsystem to cope with the many challenges before us.\r\nLong-term security is closely linked to sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. We need to\r\nstrengthen not only the United Nations capacity to provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance but also its long-term social and\r\neconomic development efforts.\r\nA basic problem is the lack of funds. The donor\r\ncommunity needs to ensure sufficient and predictable\r\nfinancial resources to allow the reforms to produce long-\r\nterm results. Sweden is one of only four countries that meet\r\nthe United Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product. Development requires a true partnership\r\nbetween countries, ensuring sufficient external resources,\r\nsound use of internal resources and good governance.\r\nThe reform process has to continue, and we look\r\nforward to the Millennium Assembly and the summit next\r\nyear as an opportunity to accelerate the work.\r\nWe all have a tendency to blame the United Nations\r\nfor our own failures and shortcomings. In fact, when the\r\nUnited Nations fails, it is because we fail. If the United\r\nNations loses its relevance, we lose. There is no real\r\nalternative to global cooperation to cope with increasingly\r\nglobal problems, and for this, we need the United\r\nNations — but a strengthened and reformed United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Rashid Abdullah Al-Noaimi.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to extend to\r\nyou, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, my congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. I am confident that your experience, diplomatic\r\nskills and political ability will contribute effectively and\r\npositively to the success of the session’s proceedings.\r\nI should also like to express my thanks to your\r\npredecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, for the prudent manner in which he\r\ndirected the work of the previous session.\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to express our\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nhis efforts in strengthening the role of the United Nations\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe welcome the admission of the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga to membership in the United Nations, which\r\nstrengthens its universality.\r\nAs this session convenes on the eve of the third\r\nmillennium, the international environment remains\r\nplagued by a multitude of problems and challenges, the\r\nmost salient of which are manifest in the ever-increasing\r\ngrowth of the phenomena of poverty, environmental\r\npollution, armed conflicts, ethnic and religious cleansing,\r\nthe race to acquire proscribed weapons, organized crime,\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\ndrugs and international terrorism in its various forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nDealing with such global problems and phenomena\r\nrequires that all States adhere to the Charter of the United\r\nNations, respect international law and work on\r\nstrengthening the mechanisms for cooperation among\r\nnations, including the completion of the structural reforms\r\nin the United Nations, particularly in the Security Council\r\nand the Economic and Social Council.\r\nIn this connection, we express our appreciation for the\r\npositive role played by the specialized agencies and\r\norganizations of the United Nations in providing emergency\r\nhumanitarian and development assistance to the many\r\npeoples affected by the consequences of conflicts and by\r\nnatural and other disasters.\r\nThe course of political events and the wars that raged\r\nin the Arab Gulf region in the past two decades, as well as\r\ntheir political, economic and social implications, have more\r\nthan ever before reinforced the conviction of the members\r\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council of the importance of\r\nconsolidating the bonds of bilateral and multilateral\r\ncooperation between the States of the region and the other\r\nmembers of the international community. This must be\r\nbased on the principles of good neighbourliness,\r\nconfidence-building measures, peaceful coexistence, non-\r\nintervention in the internal affairs of countries, mutual\r\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States,\r\nrenunciation of the threat or use of force and the settlement\r\nof existing disputes through dialogue and peaceful means.\r\nIn addition regional and international cooperation and the\r\nstrengthening of national capabilities must be reinforced and\r\nencouraged, particularly in the fields of social, economic,\r\ncultural and human development.\r\nIt is this conviction that underlies the position of the\r\nmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council in providing\r\nvarious forms of humanitarian and development assistance\r\nto the many countries of the third world that have been\r\naffected by wars, conflicts and natural disasters, the most\r\nrecent of which was the allocation of $400 million for\r\nfinancing reconstruction and development in the earthquake-\r\nstricken areas of Turkey.\r\nThe continued occupation by the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran of three United Arab Emirates islands, Greater Tunb,\r\nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa, for almost 29 years stands out\r\nin stark contrast not only to the clearly peaceful attitudes\r\nadopted by the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, but\r\nalso reveals the true intentions of Iran, which persists in\r\nviolating the territorial integrity of the United Arab\r\nEmirates. We had hoped that the Iranian political\r\ndiscourse on this issue would be translated into practical\r\nand positive steps in response to the peaceful initiatives\r\nof our Head of State, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin\r\nSultan Al-Nahyan. Those initiatives, which had met with\r\nthe support and backing of all friendly and fraternal\r\nStates, called for either entering into serious bilateral\r\nnegotiations, with transparent intentions, or accepting the\r\nsubmission of the dispute to the International Court of\r\nJustice.\r\nWe had also welcomed the establishment of a three-\r\nmember ministerial committee by the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil to be charged with developing a mechanism for\r\nthe start of serious negotiations between the United Arab\r\nEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The underlying\r\nhope is that a peaceful, just and lasting settlement be\r\nreached, one that would bring to an end the Iranian\r\noccupation of our three islands.\r\nIt is truly regrettable that the consecutive Iranian\r\nGovernments, rather than dealing with our peaceful\r\ninitiatives in a spirit of responsibility and political will,\r\nhave deliberately resorted to a policy of escalation and\r\nprovocation. They have done so by carrying out naval and\r\naerial military manoeuvres, by establishing civilian and\r\nmilitary installations on our occupied islands, and by\r\nrelentlessly seeking to change their demographic, legal\r\nand historical characteristics. The aim is to consolidate\r\nthe Iranian occupation of these islands and to establish a\r\nfait accompli by force.\r\nSuch actions represent a direct threat to regional and\r\ninternational security and stability. We consider these\r\nIranian excesses null and void, with no legal validity or\r\nbasis in the rules of international law or in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations or that of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference. They are also inconsistent with the\r\ndocumented fact that, historically and legally, these three\r\nislands are an integral part of the territorial sovereignty of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates, regardless of the duration of\r\ntheir occupation.\r\nThe security of the Arab Gulf is the collective and\r\njoint responsibility of the States of the region. Therefore\r\nwe stress the importance of promoting a political and\r\ndiplomatic dialogue as well as cooperation between those\r\nStates and of channelling their wealth and human and\r\nnatural resources towards achieving the desired economic\r\nand social development for their peoples.\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nIn this context, we call upon the Iraqi Government to\r\ncomplete its implementation of the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council, in particular those relating to the fate,\r\nwhereabouts and release of Kuwaiti nationals and citizens\r\nof other countries who are detained or held as prisoners of\r\nwar by Iraq. This is in addition to the return of Kuwaiti\r\nproperty, documents and archives, an act that would\r\ncontribute to Iraq\u0027s resuming its natural role at the regional\r\nand international levels.\r\nThe inhumane conditions visited upon the Iraqi people\r\nmake it incumbent upon all of us to seek an early end to\r\ntheir suffering. We therefore call upon the Security Council,\r\nand in particular its permanent members, to reach consensus\r\non the draft projects before it that would lead to the full\r\nimplementation of all its resolutions and to lifting the\r\ninternational economic sanctions imposed on Iraq while\r\nemphasizing the importance of respect for its sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity.\r\nProceeding from its belief in the need to achieve a just\r\nand comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on the\r\nprinciple of land for peace and on the relevant resolutions\r\nof the Security Council, the United Arab Emirates\r\nwelcomes the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and the\r\npreliminary contacts between the Palestinian and Israeli\r\nsides regarding the final status negotiations, which are to\r\ndeal with the issues of Jerusalem, settlements, refugees and\r\nborders.\r\nWe attach great importance to the political\r\ndevelopments that will lead to the realization of the\r\nobjectives and aspirations on which the peace process is\r\nbased — namely, the achievement of a peaceful, just and\r\nlasting settlement of the question of Palestine and of the\r\nMiddle East problem. We call upon the Israeli Government\r\nto implement fully and scrupulously, and without further\r\ndelay or obstructions, all of the obligations and\r\ncommitments it has assumed within the framework of these\r\nagreements. I refer in particular to those relating to halting\r\nsettlement activities and policies in various parts of\r\noccupied Palestinian land and other occupied Arab\r\nterritories, including Jerusalem, and to the return of\r\nPalestinian refugees in accordance with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the international community and the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention.\r\nIn applauding the positive role played by the United\r\nStates of America in reviving the peace process, we express\r\nthe hope that further efforts will be made by the co-\r\nsponsors of the process and by the members of the\r\nEuropean Union and other influential States to persuade the\r\nIsraeli Government to fulfil its historical, political and\r\nlegal obligations that are based on the principles of\r\ninternational law and the principle of land for peace. This\r\nwould restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate\r\nrights and would enable them to exercise self-\r\ndetermination and establish their own independent state in\r\nPalestine, with Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nWe also reiterate our full and unqualified support for\r\nthe position of Lebanon and demand that the Government\r\nof Israel implement Security Council resolution 425\r\n(1978). That resolution calls for the Israeli forces to\r\nwithdraw, without any preconditions, from southern\r\nLebanon and from the West Bekaa Valley, and to resume\r\nnegotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks at the\r\npoint where they were cut off. The aim is to ensure a\r\ncomplete Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Arab Golan\r\nHeights to the line of 4 June 1967, in accordance with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nThe acquisition and possession of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons, are contrary to\r\nthe objectives and recommendations unanimously adopted\r\nby members of the international community at the 1995\r\nReview and Extension Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). This not only contributes to the escalation of the\r\nproscribed arms race and the heightening of tensions, but\r\nalso disrupts the security balance at the regional and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nConsonant with its position that favours the\r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones throughout\r\nthe world, the United Arab Emirates emphasizes the\r\nimportance and necessity of establishing a zone free from\r\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons,\r\nin the region of the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf. It\r\nrenews its call to the international community to exert\r\ngreater efforts, demanding that Israel accede to the NPT\r\nand place all of its nuclear facilities under the safeguards\r\nregime of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in\r\norder to ensure peace and security in the region and the\r\nattainment of the desired economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council\r\nfollowed with keen interest the recent developments in\r\nEast Timor and the pressures placed on the Republic of\r\nIndonesia despite its acceptance of the results of the\r\nreferendum in that territory. In this connection, we\r\nwelcome the positive stance of the Indonesian\r\nGovernment, especially its readiness to provide necessary\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nsupport for the peaceful transfer of authority in that\r\nterritory, in cooperation with the United Nations. We\r\ntherefore stress the importance of respecting the territorial\r\nintegrity of the Republic of Indonesia in order to restore\r\nsecurity and stability in that region.\r\nThe continuing state of conflict between our two\r\nfriends, India and Pakistan, over the question of Kashmir,\r\nis a source of profound concern to us because it constitutes\r\na direct threat to regional and global security and stability.\r\nWe therefore invite both Governments to exercise a policy\r\nof self-restraint and to resort to dialogue and peaceful\r\nnegotiations in settling their differences, in accordance with\r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the rules\r\nand regulations of international law and the provisions of\r\nthe recent Lahore accord. We also support all efforts\r\ndesigned to bring about peaceful resolutions of the conflicts\r\nin South-East Asia and the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe international community recently followed the\r\ndevelopments of the deplorable events to which the people\r\nof Kosovo, particularly the Muslims, were subjected. These\r\nevents included ethnic and religious cleansing, population\r\ndisplacements and other heinous crimes by Yugoslav and\r\nSerbian forces, in blatant violation of international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates, acting on high-level\r\ninstructions from an informed leadership, was one of the\r\nfirst countries to participate in the international relief\r\noperation. Our armed forces, together with the Red\r\nCrescent Society and other humanitarian organizations,\r\nprovided humanitarian, medical, food and development\r\nassistance to the people of Kosovo. In addition, military\r\ntroops from the Emirates participated in the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operation in Kosovo, helping to ensure the\r\nreturn of the refugees to their homes and land, maintain\r\ninternal security and initiate and develop vital projects such\r\nas schools, roads and hospitals. It is essential for\r\ninternational efforts to continue in order to provide the\r\npeople of Kosovo with security and humanitarian\r\nguarantees and enable them to achieve their legitimate\r\naspirations. It is also in the interest of establishing peace\r\nand security in the Balkans.\r\nDespite the positive initiatives by the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the Security Council, and by the Organization\r\nof African Unity to contain conflicts, resolve the internal\r\nand regional security problems which plague certain States\r\nin Africa and promote national reconciliation between the\r\nvarious political factions, conditions there remain,\r\nregrettably unstable. We therefore call upon the States\r\nconcerned to assume their historic and political\r\nresponsibilities and resolve their problems by peaceful\r\nmeans so as to enable the peoples of Africa to achieve\r\ntheir aspirations for peace and sustainable development.\r\nIn this context, we should like to reiterate that the\r\nsanctions imposed on Libya must be lifted now that it has\r\nimplemented the Security Council resolutions in respect\r\nof the Lockerbie issue.\r\nNotwithstanding the relatively positive changes in\r\ninternational economic relations, the liberalization of\r\nworld trade and multilateral cooperation in the fields of\r\ndevelopment, finance and trade, the economic and social\r\ngap between developed and developing countries is still\r\nwidening. The consequences of the financial crises in the\r\ncountries of South-East Asia and elsewhere continue to be\r\nfelt: they have contributed to the decline in economic\r\ngrowth in many States. Dealing with these and other\r\nsimilar dysequilibria will require a comprehensive and\r\nobjective assessment of financial, investment, customs\r\ntariff and trade arrangements with a view to initiating\r\nNorth-South and South-South dialogue to promote\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation and coordination.\r\nIn this connection, the relevant international and\r\nregional development institutions have an important role\r\nto play in ensuring the stability of the world economic\r\nand financial order, a continued flow of development\r\nassistance from developed to developing countries and\r\ncancellation of the poorest countries debts. Cooperation at\r\nthe bilateral, regional and subregional levels is also a\r\npositive step towards stabilizing international economic\r\nrelations and, if carried out on the basis of\r\ncomplementarity, equality and justice, should enable the\r\ndeveloping countries to become effective participants and\r\nshould ensure regional and international security and\r\nstability.\r\nIn conclusion, we express the hope that the\r\npreparatory meetings for the Millennium Assembly in\r\n2000 will have a positive outcome, leading to the\r\nfulfilment of our countries’ and peoples’ aspirations for\r\npeace, security and sustainable development.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Spain, His Excellency Mr.\r\nAbel Matutes, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Matutes (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I sincerely\r\ncongratulate Mr. Gurirab on his election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at this session, the last to be held\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nbefore the start of the new millennium, and I wish him\r\ngreat success in the performance of his duties. At the same\r\ntime I wish to thank his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for\r\nthe effective way in which he presided over the previous\r\nAssembly.\r\nSpain subscribes fully to the statement made by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Finland on behalf of the\r\nStates members of the European Union and should like to\r\ncontribute to this general debate by presenting my\r\ndelegation’s point of view with regard to the complex\r\nproblems facing the United Nations at this time.\r\nI should also like to welcome the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Spain\r\noffers them its full cooperation in the tasks that await them\r\nas new Members of the Organization.\r\nThis has, indeed, been a difficult year for the\r\nOrganization. Serious crises have arisen in different parts of\r\nthe world and, at times, the role played in them by the\r\nUnited Nations has been questioned. We are all aware of\r\nthe efforts made by the Secretary-General to enable the\r\nOrganization fully to play the role for which it was founded\r\nin 1945. However, in certain sectors of international public\r\nopinion the idea has taken hold that the United Nations has\r\nbeen incapable of assuming its central and proper role in\r\nsuch situations.\r\nLike any human institution, the United Nations has\r\nhad its successes and its failures. Nevertheless, it has been\r\na key factor in international relations throughout the second\r\nhalf of the twentieth century and it continues to be so on\r\nthe threshold of the twenty-first. It fulfils an essential\r\nfunction, which will have to be progressively strengthened\r\nas the phenomenon of globalization develops. It is indeed\r\na unique instrument for the international relations we are\r\nsharing for the twenty-first century.\r\nIt is obvious that, while acknowledging the unique\r\nvalue of the United Nations, we must revise some aspects\r\nof the way in which it operates. That is why the process of\r\nreform undertaken by the Secretary-General is so important.\r\nWe must continue to make further progress in that\r\ndirection.\r\nI should like to stress that Spain does not think of the\r\nreform of the United Nations as an exercise whose sole and\r\nessential objective is to save money. Rather, we consider\r\nsuch reform to be a way of enabling it successfully to meet\r\nthe challenges of the new century.\r\nA key aspect of this process is the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Spain believes that such reform must\r\npursue three basic goals. First, there must be greater\r\ntransparency in its working methods, with an increase in\r\nthe number and the quality of the consultations, both\r\nbetween the countries that make up the Council and\r\nbetween those countries and other Member States.\r\nSecondly, it should be more efficient, for which purpose\r\nit would be advisable to limit the exercise of the right of\r\nveto. There are instances in which the exercise of this\r\nright, or even the more or less veiled threat to exercise it,\r\nhas blocked the functioning of the Security Council and\r\nprevented the adoption of essential decisions that enjoyed\r\na broad consensus within the international community. To\r\na large extent, that has promoted the image of the United\r\nNations as inefficient and impotent in the eyes of some\r\nsectors of public opinion. Thirdly, it should be made more\r\ndemocratic, which would mean adapting the Council’s\r\ncomposition to recent developments in the international\r\ncommunity. In current circumstances, and given the split\r\nbetween Member States, it seems possible to reach a\r\nsufficient consensus only with regard to the idea of\r\nincreasing the number of non-permanent members. Spain\r\nis in favour of increasing the representation on the\r\nSecurity Council of all regional groups.\r\nDelays in the payment of contributions by some\r\nStates are unjustifiable and endanger the very operation of\r\nthe Organization at the very time when it is called upon\r\nto carry out increasingly complex tasks. It is not possible\r\nto tolerate the current level of non-payment and at the\r\nsame time require the United Nations to set up the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, to\r\norganize the transition to independence in East Timor, to\r\nestablish international criminal courts, to deal with the\r\nplight of refugees, to send peacekeeping forces to various\r\nparts of the world, and to allocate sufficient resources to\r\nits numerous development programmes.\r\nI would like my Government’s position on this\r\nsubject to be properly understood. Spain is the eighth-\r\nlargest contributor to the Organization’s regular budget,\r\nand as such has a very direct interest in matters such as\r\nbudgetary discipline and the effective use of resources.\r\nMoreover, Spain considers that all matters of concern to\r\nMember States on this issue can and must be thoroughly\r\ndiscussed. What is not acceptable, however, is for anyone\r\nto make payment conditional on the granting of unilateral\r\ndemands.\r\nThe coming Millennium Assembly will provide a\r\ngood opportunity to reflect on all these issues, as well as\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\non the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. That Assembly, in the preparation of which civil\r\nsociety will participate, must likewise encourage vigorous\r\ndebate yielding concrete results. That debate must, in my\r\nopinion, focus on two main issues: the elimination of\r\npoverty and the consequences of globalization.\r\nA policy to eliminate poverty involves, inter alia, a\r\nstrategy of conflict prevention, sustainable development\r\npolicies, good governance and the regular provision of\r\nfunds for development financing. All these mean that\r\nefforts must be pooled and responsibilities shared by\r\ndeveloped and developing States alike.\r\nGlobalization is a phenomenon that involves risks, but\r\nthat also creates opportunities. The risk is that the weakest\r\ncountries and the most defenceless sectors of the population\r\nwill be marginalized from its benefits. Clearly, decisive\r\naction by Governments is needed, along with international\r\ncooperation. Threats to cultural and linguistic plurality\r\nlikewise require decisive defensive measures.\r\nAt the same time, globalization also generates\r\nopportunities and benefits: economic growth, better\r\ncommunications and greater access to information, as well\r\nas possibilities for bringing different peoples and cultures\r\ncloser together. It is especially here that the unique value of\r\nthe United Nations is most striking. In the face of all these\r\nnew global problems, which go far beyond the capacity of\r\nStates for individual action, only a multilateral response\r\nwill suffice, the result of dialogue and international\r\ncooperation. The United Nations is the most appropriate\r\nforum for this.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping operations, only the\r\nUnited Nations, in the final analysis, has the legitimacy\r\nnecessary to authorize them. This year Spain has doubled\r\nthe number of troops that it contributes to these operations;\r\nthey are currently deployed in United Nations missions in\r\nGuatemala, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and East\r\nTimor. To this should be added the large number of troops\r\nthat my country has placed at the service of missions\r\nauthorized by Security Council resolutions, such as the\r\nStabilization Force (SFOR) and KFOR. Spain participated\r\nin the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola\r\n(MONUA) until its recent termination, and is now\r\ncooperating with the project to strengthen African\r\ncapabilities for peacekeeping operations.\r\nAs a reflection of my country’s commitment, Spain\r\nwill in the next few weeks sign a memorandum of\r\nunderstanding on placing a rapidly deployable\r\npeacekeeping force at the disposal of the United Nations.\r\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, it is no longer\r\ntolerable to mankind’s ethical conscience that atrocities\r\nand war crimes should go unpunished. But until recently\r\nthe international community had not channeled these\r\ngeneralized feelings into a course of concrete action. Yet\r\nagain, it was the United Nations that did this, by\r\nconvening the Rome Conference at which the Statute of\r\nthe International Criminal Court was adopted. Spain\r\nsigned the Statute, and the ratification process is now at\r\nan advanced stage. Moreover, Spain has taken initiatives\r\nto promote the signing and ratification of the treaty in\r\norder that it may enter into force as soon as possible.\r\nThe United Nations has made a vital contribution to\r\nthe universalization of human rights. Having been elected\r\na member of the Commission on Human Rights for a\r\nthree-year period, Spain will continue to cooperate with\r\nthe United Nations in the defence of these rights in line\r\nwith one of the basic tenets of its foreign policy.\r\nClosely related to this issue is the concept of human\r\nsecurity. At a previous session of the General Assembly,\r\nSpain took the initiative to propose a draft resolution on\r\nthe safety and security of international humanitarian\r\npersonnel, which was ultimately adopted as resolution\r\n52/167. The activity of the Special Committee on\r\nChildren and Armed Conflict is especially important at\r\nthis time, as is the significant work of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Representative on this matter, Mr. Olara\r\nOtunnu. The recent Security Council resolution 1261\r\n(1999) is a major step forward in the approach to this\r\nproblem.\r\nDevelopment cooperation is undoubtedly one of the\r\nmain global issues on the United Nations agenda. The\r\nspecial meeting on development financing planned for\r\n2001 must be properly prepared, and the follow-up of the\r\nmajor conferences must continue.\r\nSpain attaches special importance to the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative, whose\r\nscope and depth must be enhanced. In the wake of\r\nhurricane Mitch, Spain initiated debt-cancellation\r\nprogrammes for the most harshly affected countries of the\r\nCentral American region.\r\nMy country has made a substantial effort in recent\r\nyears in respect of its development cooperation\r\nprogrammes. Not many years ago Spain was an aid\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nrecipient, while it now stands above the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development average in the\r\npercentage of its gross domestic product devoted to\r\ndevelopment. In 1998, official development assistance funds\r\ngrew by 14 per cent, placing Spain among the three\r\ndeveloped countries which had most increased these funds\r\nduring the year.\r\nWith regard to disarmament, the United Nations and\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament will continue to prepare\r\nfor a conference on small arms to be held in 2001, and will\r\nattempt to offset recent reversals in the non-proliferation\r\nregime. It is essential that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty should speedily enter into force, and that\r\ndifficulties in the preparation of the next review conference\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nbe overcome.\r\nIt is also necessary to conclude negotiations on a\r\nverification protocol to the Convention on the Prohibition\r\nof the Development, Production and Stockpiling of\r\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\nTheir Destruction, and to address the issue of fissile\r\nmaterials.\r\nThere are many other global issues on which the\r\nUnited Nations plays a vital role, such as the fight against\r\nterrorism, drugs and organized crime. However, I should\r\nlike to dwell for a moment on another matter to which my\r\nGovernment attaches great importance: problems of ageing\r\nand of older people. Spain wishes to contribute to the\r\ndebate on an international strategy on older people based on\r\nthe existing model in my country. Spain has also submitted\r\nits candidacy as the venue for the second World Assembly\r\non Ageing, which could be convened in 2002.\r\nFinally, allow me to refer to the problem of\r\ndecolonization. At the conclusion of this Decade for the\r\nEradication of Colonization, my country continues to\r\nendure the presence of a colonial enclave on its territory.\r\nGibraltar was occupied by British troops in 1704, during\r\none of the European wars of succession. The Territory was\r\nturned into a military base and the Spanish population was\r\nexpelled. Until very recently Spanish citizens in Gibraltar\r\nsuffered grave discrimination in the exercise of their rights.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2353 (XXII) backed the\r\nSpanish views on the decolonization of the Territory,\r\nrecognizing that Gibraltar’s colonial situation should be\r\nsettled not through self-determination, but, rather, through\r\nthe restoration of Spanish territorial integrity. Unfortunately,\r\nits terms have been ignored by the colonial Power. Spain\r\nand Great Britain began a process of negotiation on all\r\nthe issues, including sovereignty, based on the 1984\r\nBrussels Declaration, but no significant progress has been\r\nmade. Spain has made a proposal to the United Kingdom\r\nthat takes into account the interests of the inhabitants of\r\nthe colony and would allow for the recovery of\r\nsovereignty over the Territory after a lengthy period, so\r\nfar without reply. My Government will continue both its\r\ndialogue with the United Kingdom and cooperation with\r\nthe decolonization Committee in following up on this\r\nissue.\r\nFrom the crises the world has lived through this\r\nyear, we must learn certain lessons. One is without doubt\r\nthat the political resolution of the crisis in Kosovo has\r\nonly been possible thanks to the United Nations, which\r\nfaced an urgent challenge, and on the success or failure\r\nof its response depends to a large extent the public image\r\nof our Organization.\r\nIn the Western Sahara Spain has supported with\r\nconcrete measures the action of the United Nations\r\nMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\r\n(MINURSO), and also the Secretary-General’s settlement\r\nplan. It is willing to increase this support if asked to do\r\nso by the Organization and if the parties directly involved\r\nagree.\r\nThe new possibilities in the Middle East after the\r\nsigning of the Sharm-el Sheikh Memorandum are seen by\r\nmy country with great hope, and we are firmly committed\r\nto continue cooperating with all sides so that the process\r\nbegun in Madrid continues on track.\r\nOther regions of the world have suffered particularly\r\nduring this past year. Unfortunately, this is especially true\r\nof Africa, and therefore I wish to emphasize my country’s\r\nsupport for the integrated approach taken by the\r\nSecretary-General in treating the causes of the conflicts\r\nand promoting peace on that continent.\r\nFinally, the most recent challenge to the United\r\nNations is the situation in East Timor. Spain welcomed\r\nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 1264 (1999),\r\nand is willing to contribute to the multinational force to\r\nguarantee security in the Territory. My country, likewise,\r\nhas announced a special contribution to the fund\r\nestablished by the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees(UNHCR) to deal urgently\r\nwith the acute humanitarian situation and the refugee\r\nproblems on the island.\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nThe Organization’s undertakings are sometimes\r\nvisible, at other times hidden, but they are always\r\nindispensable. The citizens of our countries must value\r\nthem so that the United Nations may enjoy the backing that\r\nit needs in order to perform its important duties effectively.\r\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, Spain\r\nreiterates yet again its firm commitment to the Organization\r\nand its willingness to put its capacity for external action at\r\nthe service of the purposes and principles enumerated in the\r\nCharter.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right\r\nof reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in the exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Flores (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation\r\nwould like to comment on the references to the Spanish\r\ncities of Ceuta and Melilla, and other parts of Spanish\r\nterritory, made in the speech this afternoon by the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco, a country with which Spain maintains, and wants\r\nto continue to maintain, excellent relations.\r\nI would like to repeat that the places mentioned are an\r\nintegral part of Spanish territory, whose citizens are\r\nrepresented in the Spanish Parliament on precisely the same\r\nfooting and under the same conditions as their compatriots.\r\nMr. Kourosh (Iran): Some claims raised today by the\r\nForeign Minister of the United Arab Emirates against the\r\nterritorial integrity of my country are unacceptable and\r\nbaseless. Since our position on this issue is very clear, I\r\nneed not get into specifics. I would just like to emphasize\r\nthat my country is fully committed to its international\r\nobligations, including those arising from the 1971\r\nUnderstanding. We have friendly ties with our neighbours\r\nin the Persian Gulf, and we stand ready, as in the past, to\r\nenter into substantive discussion with United Arab Emirates\r\nofficials in good faith and with no preconditions in order to\r\nsolve any possible problem.\r\nOur message to our neighbours, including the United\r\nArab Emirates, is one of friendship, fraternity and\r\ncooperation. We continue to make efforts to strengthen\r\nconfidence and cooperation in the Persian Gulf region.\r\nConsolidation of peace and security is a matter of great\r\nimportance in our region, and in this context my country\r\nhas so far spared no efforts to further the cause of peace\r\nand security in the region.\r\nMr. Richmond (United Kingdom): I would like to\r\nsay a few words in response to the remarks by the\r\nForeign Minister of Spain about Gibraltar. The long-\r\nstanding position of the British Government on this matter\r\nis well known to the Government of Spain. I will simply\r\nrestate it briefly here.\r\nBritish sovereignty over Gibraltar was clearly\r\nestablished in the Treaty of Utrecht. This legal fact is\r\nincontrovertible. Moreover, the British Government stands\r\nby the commitment to the people of Gibraltar contained\r\nin the preamble to the 1969 Constitution of Gibraltar,\r\nwhich states that the United Kingdom will not enter into\r\narrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would\r\npass under the sovereignty of another State against their\r\nfreely and democratically expressed wishes.\r\nThe British Government believes that issues relating\r\nto Gibraltar can be resolved only by direct talks, such as\r\nthose established under the 1984 Brussels Declaration. In\r\nthat regard, we attach importance to continuing the\r\ndialogue with Spain as a means to overcoming our\r\ndifferences.\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The representative of Iran made a statement in\r\nresponse to the Foreign Minister of the United Arab\r\nEmirates on the question of his country\u0027s occupation of\r\nour three islands. This statement has not added to the\r\npositions of Iran, which continue to threaten peace and\r\nstability in the region. They run contrary to the statement\r\nmade in this forum by President Khatami on the dialogue\r\nof civilizations, which must be based on the principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter and on respect for\r\ninternational law, not the occupation of the territories of\r\nothers.\r\nI would like here to remind the representative of Iran\r\nthat the chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard last\r\nweek adopted positions that threaten the security of the\r\nregion,\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 21 September 1999\r\nby threatening to use force if the United Arab Emirates\r\nwere to restore its legitimate rights in the three islands. The\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates\r\nhas reiterated our firm position regarding Iran\u0027s occupation\r\nof our three islands. We will continue our efforts and\r\npeaceful endeavours to put an end to this situation. It is our\r\nhope that Iran, our neighbour, will respond to our peaceful\r\ninitiatives — which enjoy the support both of the members\r\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and of the\r\ninternational community — to ensure the stability, security\r\nand safety of our region, and to improve the relations\r\nbetween the members of the GCC and the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.35 p.m.\r\n42\r\n"
