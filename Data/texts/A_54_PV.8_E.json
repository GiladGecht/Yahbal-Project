(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Roberto Flores Facussé,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Honduras.\r\nMr. Carlos Roberto Flores Facussé, President of the\r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras, His Excellency Mr.\r\nCarlos Roberto Flores Facussé, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Facussé (spoke in Spanish): I wish to\r\nexpress my pleasure at your recent election, Mr. President.\r\nI also wish to acknowledge the work of your illustrious\r\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti. The Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, also deserves acknowledgement for his\r\nuntiring efforts to ensure that peace and security govern\r\ninternational relations in this turbulent world in which we\r\nlive, always showing sensitivity and a very special concern\r\nfor those who suffer the most, have the least, and therefore\r\nneed the greatest care.\r\nAlmost a year ago, Central America was tragically\r\nstruck by one of the most terrible hurricanes of the century.\r\nOur country, Honduras, was the most severely damaged,\r\nwith billions of dollars in losses resulting from the\r\ndestruction of more than 70 per cent of its infrastructure\r\nand economy. More than 15,000 people were killed,\r\ninjured or went missing and more than 1.5 million\r\nsuffered losses, either directly or indirectly, a high\r\npercentage of whom lost their homes, belongings and\r\nbusinesses in their entirety.\r\nThose unfortunate circumstances through which we\r\nhad to live, the consequences of which we have only just\r\nbegun to recover from, have been aggravated in recent\r\nweeks by the severity of the winter and high levels of\r\nprecipitation. Once again, the banks of our country’s main\r\nrivers have overflowed, as it was not possible to dredge\r\nthem because of lack of time and resources. This is again\r\njeopardizing the safety of numerous population centres\r\nand cities, causing more flooding and mudslides and\r\nblocking the country’s main transportation arteries. This\r\nhas brought further insecurity and anguish to our\r\npopulation, adding new losses and difficulties to the\r\nalready grave state of affairs we have faced since last\r\nOctober.\r\nHurricane Mitch and other natural phenomena of\r\nuncommon violence lay bare the physical vulnerability of\r\nour countries and highlight the absolute necessity of early\r\nand organized preventive measures. Such preventive\r\nmeasures can be achieved at the national, regional,\r\ncontinental and, indeed, global levels only through\r\ncombined, joint efforts and resources. No country, much\r\nless a country that is poor in material resources, is up to\r\nthe task of bearing the massive destructive power of these\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nphenomena alone. This is a huge new challenge for the\r\nUnited Nations, whose diligent attention to this matter we\r\ntake this opportunity to request, knowing that it stands to\r\nsave thousands upon thousands of lives, spare us enormous\r\ndamage, and deflect immense ills.\r\nWe, the Honduran people, have always valued the\r\nworld’s solidarity, for which we are most grateful, and have\r\nalso learned that brotherhood among men and among\r\nnations is a value that we must not lose. On the contrary,\r\nwe must revitalize, strengthen and disseminate it, especially\r\nnow that globalization and high-speed communications are\r\ndrawing States and continents closer together, making it\r\npossible for one nation instantly to feel the pain that afflicts\r\nanother as if it affected us all directly.\r\nMore than neighbours, we must be brethren. Beyond\r\ncooperation, we must sow the seeds of brotherhood.\r\nSolidarity is a fine thing, but brotherhood is stronger and\r\nmore human, because it breathes from the depth of our\r\nhearts that divine, universal breath of life with which God\r\nendows each and every one of his creatures so that we\r\nshould be equal and enjoy the planet’s wealth as equals.\r\nSince its founding in 1945, the United Nations has\r\nplayed a preeminent role in the life of our planet. The 50\r\nnations that met at San Francisco, California, among which\r\nthe Honduran people were honoured to count ourselves, and\r\nthat signed the United Nations Charter, have increased in\r\nnumber over the years. Some have changed, while others\r\nhave disappeared as multinational or federated structures.\r\nTherefore, the challenges that the next century will place\r\nbefore the United Nations are new, even greater challenges,\r\nand most likely will be even more difficult and will arise\r\never more frequently.\r\nThe growing victories of human rights; the accelerated\r\nexpansion of democracy as a system of governance and\r\ncoexistence among peoples; the rights of women and\r\nchildren, and the imperative to protect both against abuse,\r\ndiscrimination and violence: these are matters that challenge\r\nthe creative imagination of the world’s peoples and\r\nGovernments. They are paradigms for a new millennium,\r\nwhose portals we approach with a watchful mind and a\r\nhopeful heart.\r\nPeace; the environment; population growth; the\r\nabandonment of the fields and the forced, chaotic\r\nurbanization of our cities — which have thus become\r\nruralized; issues of food; the vast differences between a\r\nsmall cluster of rich nations and an immense universe of\r\nnations that are in a permanent process of pauperization;\r\nand the eradication of weapons of mass destruction: these\r\nare but a few of the topics that transcend the boundaries\r\nof the centuries. These issues demand new approaches\r\nand solutions formulated in the light of the experiences\r\nthat this waning century leaves us.\r\nNow, when the end of the twentieth century enables\r\nus to be exceptionally privileged witnesses to a change of\r\nmillennium, is a time for reflection, so that we may\r\nharvest the century’s finest fruits and bear them across the\r\nbridge between the centuries. However, we must not carry\r\nto the other frontier of time those things that in this\r\ncentury have produced the great disasters of war and\r\nagonizing tensions on the international scene; nor must\r\nwe hold on to those that have segregated peoples and\r\ndismembered entire States or that have spawned the\r\nmarginalization and exclusion that still torment a large\r\npart of humanity.\r\nIt is of the utmost necessity, then, that fraternity\r\nshould return to its rightful place in the triangle of liberal\r\nprinciples, the very ideals that gave birth to the rule of\r\nlaw and the concept of constitutionality, to harmony and\r\nequality among individuals and among nations, thus\r\nshaping democratic States and the paradigm of human\r\nfreedom as the basis of the existence of humankind, its\r\nvery raison d’être on this planet.\r\nWe say that the elder siblings among the community\r\nof nations must adopt the concept of fraternity as a\r\nprinciple and a guiding ethic for international coexistence\r\nwith their brethren, so that together — without exclusion,\r\nwithout the yawning chasms that separate the great from\r\nthe small, the wealthy from the impoverished — we may\r\nall cross to the other side of the millennium with a new\r\noutlook of justice, opportunity and hope, for the sake of\r\nall that we are as the human race, and for the sake of all\r\nthe efforts, sacrifices and suffering expended in our\r\nattempts to dodge the blows of economic disparity and\r\nunjust treatment in finance and markets. Yet we have\r\nremained steadfast, and continue to do so through titanic\r\nefforts and countless sacrifices, to avoid being left behind\r\nby development, cultural trends and the scientific and\r\ntechnological benefits of transportation and\r\ncommunications. We have struggled for all of this while\r\ngiving our heroes and martyrs to the cause of freedom;\r\nwe stretch as far as we can to develop democratic rule in\r\nour States. We struggle each and every day to make\r\ndemocratic rule able to govern, credible, hope-inspiring\r\nand trustworthy in the eyes and hearts of the many who\r\ndo not always have the patience to wait until the benefits\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nof the system materialize, who despair and grow weary of\r\ndreaming dreams that are difficult to attain.\r\nFor democracy to survive the times and to justify the\r\nhigh price that we have paid for it, it must respond to the\r\nconcerns and aspirations of peoples. Protecting against\r\nregression in what so many have paid dearly to achieve;\r\npreserving the advances we have made; and finding a way\r\nto ensure that there will respond in a positive way for the\r\nbenefit of peoples: these are the greatest challenges that we\r\ncarry with us as we meet the coming millennium.\r\nCentral Americans have learned, through bitter\r\nexperience and a painful toll of blood and sacrifice, that\r\nfraternity is a higher value than mere neighbourliness, that\r\ncooperation and understanding yield better fruit for us than\r\npast rivalries and local nationalisms and that there is no\r\ndifference, however serious it may appear, that we cannot\r\nresolve in a peaceful, harmonious and civilized manner.\r\nA few days ago the presidents of El Salvador and\r\nHonduras set a beautiful example for the continent and the\r\nworld when they ratified the Convention on Nationality and\r\nAcquired Rights which covers the inhabitants of the areas\r\ndelimited by the Judgment of 11 September 1992 of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice in the land, island and\r\nmaritime frontier dispute between El Salvador and\r\nHonduras. With this action, we have resolved, definitively\r\nand in perpetuity, the frontier dispute which for many years\r\ncast a pall over our fraternal relations.\r\nThe Central American bloc is today working towards\r\naccess to the United States market under conditions as\r\nadvantageous as those already enjoyed by other partners to\r\nour north; also, as a region we are seeking to open up the\r\nfield for ourselves in trade throughout the continent through\r\nagreements with other existing blocs and with individual\r\nnations, including Mexico and countries of South America.\r\nCentral America is preparing to cross the bridge\r\nbetween the millennia with all its republics more integrated\r\nwith each other than ever before, identifying with each\r\nother in the common ideal of keeping ourselves united so\r\nthat we are stronger, of playing a stellar role in the\r\nAmerican continent, of turning the isthmus into a point of\r\nstrategic convergence for world trade, and of writing\r\nourselves into a success story that will serve as an example\r\nand touchstone to the world community.\r\nThe globalization process, which has accelerated over\r\nthe last decade, will continue to expand, creating challenges\r\nand chances, problems and opportunities. The dizzying\r\nflows of capital which in a single day can wreak\r\ncatastrophic collapse on the economies of entire countries\r\nand regions must surely merit special attention from this\r\nOrganization. Our peoples fail to understand why they\r\nshould be affected by breakdowns in the financial system\r\narising out of risk-taking and speculative flows in regions\r\nof the world that are remote, alien and even unknown to\r\nthem. We are affected by them although we play no part\r\nin them and are not to blame for them, yet they raise the\r\nprices of our staples, rob us of development opportunities,\r\nimpoverish us even further and make life harder for us.\r\nGlobalization ought to be an experience that generates\r\nbroader possibilities and greater opportunities for all\r\ncountries and for all people, not greater imbalances and\r\ninequalities.\r\nIn stark contrast to the elimination of customs and\r\nborder posts and to equal access to markets stands the\r\nneed to reinforce the identity of ethnic groups, nations,\r\ncountries and regions. Cultural diversity is a source of\r\nlegitimate pride, and of wealth, creativity and global\r\ncomplementarity. Automation of mass production cannot\r\nand should not make human behaviour, the most precious\r\nresource on our planet, automatic. Homogenizing the\r\nworld’s cultural diversity, by whatever means, would be\r\nas serious and unthinkable as eliminating the planet’s\r\nbiodiversity.\r\nThe world’s age-old desire for a new world order\r\nbased on peace, cooperation and fraternity between all\r\ncountries rather than on a balance of arms between\r\npowerful and hegemonic States has already come to pass.\r\nAlthough there are still some local problems, and\r\nalthough some old nationalisms are once again raising the\r\nflag, the world is generally a much more peaceful and\r\nstable place than it was 100 years ago. Although small\r\ngroups of terrorists are still rattling various countries in\r\nthe old world and the new, the truth is that, broadly\r\nspeaking, we live in a world which is more peaceful —\r\nthank God — than the one our forebears knew. That is\r\nwhy we must indeed acknowledge that, despite all its\r\nimperfections, the world has brought in a new world\r\norder at the end of this century and the dawn of the new,\r\nan order led by the United Nations.\r\nIn this new world order which we are seeing at the\r\nend of the second millennium, there is no more room for\r\nthe struggle left us by the Cold War, much less for\r\nEurope’s various hegemonies of the past three centuries.\r\nNor is there any possibility that one State alone can\r\ndominate the rest, as neither the human capacity nor the\r\nmaterial resources exist to do so. Rather than the balance\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nof compulsion upon which the politics of coexistence\r\nbetween the world’s strongest States was based, what\r\npredominates now is multiple independence,\r\ncomplementarity between States and international\r\ncooperation and, of course, teamwork as much in the quest\r\nfor peace as in coping with civilian crises and natural\r\ndisasters.\r\nEven a superficial look at events north and south, east\r\nand west gives us an inkling that peace, international trade\r\nand the fact that States now have no choice but to\r\ncooperate with each other have levelled the playing field in\r\ninternational relations: on the world stage, it is now not so\r\nmuch a State’s economic clout or military capability that\r\ndetermine whether its voice is heard in the debate but rather\r\nits moral force, and especially its democratic values and its\r\nideals in terms of protecting human rights. In our specific\r\ncontext here, there are no more big States and small States,\r\njust members of the world community whether committed\r\nor not to the common task of making Planet Earth a real\r\nand effective place for human happiness for everyone\r\nwithout exception.\r\nWith this in mind Honduras, together with the other\r\nrepresentatives of this great community, the United Nations,\r\ncelebrates the new world order in which all of us are\r\nneeded and are even indispensable to maintaining and\r\ndeveloping it. A crisis between one State and another, or\r\nany internal difficulties arising out of conflicts rooted in\r\ninequity or because of nationalist, racial or religious\r\ndemands, are no longer matters to be shrugged off.\r\nOn the contrary, today, with the globalized view of the\r\nEarth, each State assumes responsibility for its own\r\nprotection, not merely for its own sake, but because in that\r\nway it guarantees the life and happiness of humankind for\r\ncenturies to come.\r\nDifficulties such as those in East Timor, the crisis in\r\nKosovo, the increasing nuclearization of the Indian\r\nsubcontinent or the rise in terrorism in Colombia and\r\nRussia are issues that concern us all. Although not all\r\ncountries participate in each peacekeeping and humanitarian\r\nmission, there is a disposition and openness in each and\r\nevery one of their inhabitants to respond to the calls for\r\ninternational solidarity, whose strongest voice is that of the\r\nUnited Nations, and especially that of its Secretary-General.\r\nIn the Sahara, for several years now Honduran soldiers\r\nhave participated in peacekeeping missions under United\r\nNations command. We are sure that, like us, no other\r\ncountry skimps when it comes to offering cooperation and\r\nmaking sacrifices.\r\nBoth the intervention of the Security Council in the\r\nKosovo conflict just recently and the organization of an\r\ninternational peacekeeping force for East Timor illustrate\r\nthe efficacy of this system, which makes all of us\r\nbrethren, neighbours, friends and partners.\r\nIt is undeniable that, even as the world has changed\r\nand with obvious respect among all States, the United\r\nNations still operates using the mechanisms that were\r\nestablished at its founding in 1945. The limited number\r\nof Member States on the Security Council leaves out\r\nother States that, because of their contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of the world, should participate in the high-\r\nlevel decisions of that important organism of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nLikewise, we believe it is time to provide\r\nalternatives so that the veto power enjoyed by certain\r\nStates is limited to certain matters and certain\r\ncircumstances, and so that the mere protection of private\r\ninterests does not have excessive influence or provide\r\njustification for aggressions directed at the rest of the\r\nworld community. To end the practice whereby the veto\r\nserves as the Organization\u0027s last word should be a goal to\r\nwhich all of the States represented here dedicate ample\r\ntime and consideration.\r\nThe incorporation of three new Members into this\r\nOrganization fills us with joy and hope, while inspiring\r\nconfidence that the Organization will treat the Republic of\r\nChina in the same manner — that, as Taiwan expects, the\r\nnew world order will be reflected in greater respect for\r\nthe rights and values of Taiwan\u0027s inhabitants, including\r\nrenewed respect for its aspirations to participate fully in\r\nthe greatest human organization on Earth. I do not wish\r\nto miss this opportunity to express the solidarity of the\r\npeople of Honduras and of all Central America with the\r\npeople of Taiwan as they suffer the terrible misfortune\r\nthat is afflicting that sister region of the world.\r\nTo summarize, with regard to the new world order,\r\nwhich we hope will prevail in this global forum,\r\nHonduras supports broader representation of the peoples\r\nand the nations of the world, and a more just and\r\nbalanced representation in the discussions and decisions\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAlmost a year ago, my country was lashed by the\r\nmost fearsome and destructive hurricane in history. Along\r\nwith causing suffering among a noble and stoical people,\r\nthe tragedy made evident the sensitivity and diligence of\r\ninternational cooperation and fraternity. Marked by\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nauthentic sincerity and dedication to the highest values of\r\nbrotherhood, in which we profoundly believe, messages of\r\nconcern poured in from all over the world, along with\r\nassistance, which continues to flow, enabling the people and\r\nGovernment to reconstruct what the hurricane wrecked.\r\nThanks to that fraternity, we have moved forward in\r\nthe process of rehabilitation and reconstruction and created\r\na foundation for the transformation of Honduras — and the\r\nsame applies to Central America. I hereby declare that we,\r\nthe people of Honduras — with the tears from this recent\r\nand painful event still fresh, and while facing a new round\r\nof anguish — are back on our feet, brimming with the\r\nvibrant spirit of utmost hope, ready to become a success\r\nstory in this world, to convert tragedy into opportunity.\r\nRegarding the cooperation that most of the countries\r\npresent here have offered and continue to offer us, we take\r\nthis occasion, on behalf of the Honduran people and the\r\nGovernment over which I preside by the sovereign will of\r\nits citizens, to extend our most heartfelt gratitude to all, and\r\nlikewise to confirm before the Assembly Honduras\u0027s desire\r\nto reciprocate — in a way that is commensurate with the\r\ngreatness of its heart and the legitimacy of its democratic\r\ninstitutions — for all that the world has with such deep\r\naffection provided us in our time of trouble.\r\nAll I would add is our most respectful request that\r\ncooperating institutions and nations expedite the resources\r\nand projects that they have committed to Honduras\u0027s\r\nreconstruction, which we urgently require now more than\r\never.\r\nOn this occasion our country, never forgetting that it\r\nis a founding Member of the United Nations, calls for a\r\nreform of our Organization so that a new order, based on\r\nworldwide cooperation and fraternity, can guarantee for all\r\nof us that the Earth was created not for the strongest and\r\nthe most powerful, but for all human beings.\r\nMay God bless all nations. May God illuminate us all.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Honduras\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Carlos Roberto Flores Facussé, President of the\r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Luis Angel González Macchi, President\r\nof the Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Luis Angel González Macchi, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay, His Excellency\r\nMr. Luis Angel González Macchi, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident González Macchi (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, I wish to greet the President of the General\r\nAssembly, His Excellency Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, whom I congratulate on his\r\nelection and offer all the cooperation of the delegation of\r\nParaguay in his work.\r\nIn greeting Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I\r\ncongratulate him on his excellent work for the\r\nOrganization and reaffirm the full support of the Republic\r\nof Paraguay for his efforts on behalf of world peace.\r\nAt the same time, the delegation of Paraguay wishes\r\nto welcome the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga to membership of the United Nations.\r\nWe are convinced that their work will contribute to\r\ninternational peace and development and that their\r\npresence among us is further evidence of the\r\nuniversalization foreseen under the Charter.\r\nThis regular session of the General Assembly finds\r\nParaguay at a crucial moment in its political life and for\r\nits expectations for economic and social development. The\r\nParaguayans have very recently overcome internal\r\ndestabilization. However, a rapid, broad and heroic\r\nmobilization of the citizenry, in particular the members of\r\nParliament, youth, workers and peasants, formed an\r\nimpenetrable barrier against an attempt to foment a\r\nconstitutional collapse and provided support for the\r\nresistance to this attack on democracy.\r\nAs a result of the crisis of March 1999, the gravity\r\nand importance of which caused it to be followed by the\r\nmedia throughout the world, a Government of national\r\nunity was established in the framework of the National\r\nConstitution. That Government, which I have the honour\r\nto represent before this Assembly, is composed of all\r\npolitical parties through democratically elected\r\nparliamentarians. Today, it faces the great challenge of\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\npulling Paraguay out of chronic economic stagnation and\r\ngreat social inequity.\r\nIn various international forums, and yet again in this\r\narena of brotherhood among the States of the world,\r\nParaguay appeals for the solidarity and cooperation of the\r\nmultilateral and bilateral organizations in carrying out its\r\neconomic reactivation programme and the implementation\r\nof social and anti-poverty policies. This activity will be the\r\nbasis and guarantee of the survival of our democracy.\r\nIn this context, for the first time in my country\u0027s recent\r\nhistory, the political parties, the authorities of the State and\r\nthe representatives of civil society have agreed in a patriotic\r\nconsensus on policies and strategies to rechannel economic\r\ngrowth, alleviate poverty, combat social exclusion and\r\nachieve well-being for our people. Democracy, as an ideal\r\nform of organization and coexistence, will be insured for\r\nhistory by sustainable development, which will guarantee\r\nthe material well-being of the impoverished majority.\r\nIn this respect, my country has subscribed to and fully\r\nsupports the principles, objectives and measures adopted at\r\nthe United Nations Conferences on social development,\r\npopulation and development, and women. We are\r\nunswervingly committed to political democracy because we\r\nknow that we must consolidate it with justice, social equity,\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. My\r\nGovernment is firmly decided to participate and act jointly\r\nwith other countries of the world at all levels to enhance\r\nnatural resources and preserve the environment as an\r\nirreplaceable framework for human development.\r\nIn a significant response to the requirements of the\r\nCairo Conference, Paraguay has adopted a national plan and\r\na Council for Reproductive Health. With the establishment\r\nof the Women\u0027s Secretariat, we have strengthened women\u0027s\r\npresence in government and made available a programme\r\nfor women\u0027s equality in education. This measure has\r\nallowed us to incorporate gender equality into educational\r\nreform and to adopt a women\u0027s equal-opportunity plan.\r\nWe have attributed equal importance to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and to the\r\ncommitments made at the Children\u0027s Summit. In this\r\nrespect, the Executive Power has submitted a code for\r\nminor\u0027s for parliamentary approval.\r\nClearly, these important steps have had a positive\r\neffect. Paraguay today, according to the most recent report\r\nof the United Nations Development Programme, is in a\r\ncomparatively improved position that favours its human\r\ndevelopment indicators.\r\nThe dynamic of today\u0027s world is an unavoidable\r\nchallenge demanding not only domestic democratic\r\ncooperation, but also negotiations that will raise countries\r\nto a level of development at which they can work with\r\nother regional and multilateral partners.\r\nConvinced of this, Paraguay, freely and in full\r\nsovereignty, has decided to join the great Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) project, a regional\r\nexperiment that has proved to be a useful instrument for\r\naddressing the challenges of an ever-changing world\r\neconomy. Thus, we look forward to the opening of\r\nnegotiations to establish a free-trade zone between\r\nMERCOSUR and the European Union. Similarly,\r\nParaguay is actively participating in the ambitious Free\r\nTrade Area of the Americas, an undertaking that will\r\nhave enormous repercussions for the American continent.\r\nIn its decisive struggle for comprehensive progress,\r\nmy country is participating with renewed hope and great\r\nfaith in the ideals that formed the basis for the\r\nestablishment and existence of the United Nations. We\r\ntherefore reaffirm our full commitment to the principles\r\nof multilateralism, equal sovereignty of States and respect\r\nfor the legal order that support the essential principles of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nIn this respect, Paraguay is examining the process of\r\nchange and the strengthening of this Organization. We\r\nwill support all efforts to improve its efficiency and\r\noperational capacity to maintain peace and contribute to\r\nthe human development of all peoples.\r\nNevertheless, my country believes that the structure\r\nof the United Nations must be made less costly and more\r\nefficient. The Organization should strengthen the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, continue to streamline the\r\nSecretariat and reduce the overlap of its specialized\r\nagencies, through efficient rationalization of the flow of\r\nresources for cooperation for sustainable development.\r\nGiven the challenges facing the United Nations, we\r\nattach considerable importance to the adoption of\r\nmeasures to ensure the good financial functioning of its\r\norgans, and we therefore urge Member States, particularly\r\nthe most developed, to meet their financial obligations as\r\nan essential prerequisite for the reform of the\r\nOrganization.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nSimilarly, the Government of my country does not\r\nconsider that the present composition of the Security\r\nCouncil reflects the presence of all the main actors of the\r\ninternational community, nor that its numbers are in\r\nproportion to the totality of Members. Only an increase in\r\nthe number of permanent and non-permanent Members will\r\nensure more equitable participation within the Security\r\nCouncil and, thus the necessary political balance. In that\r\nrespect, the progressive process of international\r\ndemocratization must conclude with the elimination of the\r\nright of veto of its permanent members.\r\nTherefore, Paraguay supports the aspiration of Latin\r\nAmerica and other continents to have greater representation\r\nin the Council, where the presence of Brazil as a permanent\r\nmember, could represent the great interests of our region.\r\nParaguay is convinced that maintaining international\r\npeace and security must continue to be one of the priorities\r\nof the United Nations, in particular in those areas of\r\nconflict where its intervention can contribute decisively to\r\nstabilizing the situation on the ground and achieving peace.\r\nAs proof of its commitment to these noble purposes,\r\nthe Government of Paraguay has officially offered the\r\nSecretary-General the participation of members of its armed\r\nforces in United Nations peacekeeping operations, a\r\ndecision which will contribute to this noble humanitarian\r\npurpose. To that end, a battalion of elite officers of the\r\nParaguay army is receiving special training to participate in\r\nthose operations, in accordance with the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding to be signed between the Republic of\r\nParaguay and the United Nations.\r\nHowever, we truly believe that the best guarantee of\r\npeace, together with the monitoring of human rights and\r\nequal opportunity for development, is to reduce armaments\r\nprogressively and in a sustained manner until they are\r\ntotally eliminated.\r\nParaguay strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms,\r\nregarding it as one of the most serious threats to our\r\nsocieties. In that respect, we have supported all the United\r\nNations initiatives to counteract this scourge, making clear\r\nour resolve to prevent it, combat it and eliminate it. It is\r\ntimely to recall that my country has itself suffered from the\r\neffects of this terrible scourge; in this very year we have\r\nsuffered the horrendous assassination of the Vice-President\r\nof the Republic, Luis María Argaña. I take this opportunity\r\nfor the President of the Republic of Paraguay to thank the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the tribute which was paid to him.\r\nParaguay will not cease its struggle to eradicate terrorist\r\nbands, which are alien to our tradition and our history.\r\nWith regard to other scourges which afflict our\r\nsocieties, I must emphasize with great satisfaction the\r\nefforts which my country is making in the crusade against\r\nillicit drug-trafficking and related crimes, a struggle which\r\nis carried out with the greatest cooperation. The twentieth\r\nspecial session of the United Nations, on the question of\r\ndrugs, held in New York in June 1998, conveyed in its\r\ndecisions that spirit, which should lead us inexorably to\r\nthe final destruction of the merchants of death, a victory\r\nwhich will be achieved with the shared responsibility of\r\nthe nations committed to the crusade.\r\nThese purposes will be achieved with the faithful\r\nfulfilment of the commitments undertaken with regard to\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. In this respect,\r\nmy country has followed the recommendations of the\r\nUnited Nations with regard to signing, adhering to and\r\nratifying those commitments, whose purpose it is to\r\nstrengthen the framework for the promotion and\r\nprotection of the rights of the individual. International\r\nlegal instruments in this regard form part of the law in the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay.\r\nFor that reason, my Government accepts verification\r\nand monitoring by organizations concerned with the\r\nprotection of human rights, thus complying with the\r\nprovisions of the covenants which it has ratified, as a\r\ncommitment of its will to fulfil them. We must note here\r\nthat Paraguay has just received a visit from the Inter-\r\nAmerican Commission on Human Rights, which arrived\r\nin the country in response to an invitation by the\r\nGovernment.\r\nWith regard to the priorities of justice concerning\r\ncrimes of international scope, we find it very satisfactory\r\nto note a most promising event: the approval in 1998 of\r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, to\r\npass judgement on individuals accused of the crimes\r\nwhich most offend the human conscience. Paraguay,\r\nbeing one of the signatories, has submitted this document\r\nfor parliamentary approval.\r\nFurthermore, Paraguay, whose population includes\r\n15 per cent of foreigners, the majority of whom live in\r\nborder areas, free of segregation or discrimination, notes\r\nwith satisfaction that the problem of the Balkans is\r\nmoving back to its natural ambit, the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council, which must necessarily approve any\r\ndecision.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nOur permanent, determined support for the Conference\r\non Disarmament is one of the pillars of our international\r\npolicy. Paraguay, which supported the process of\r\ndecolonization and the autonomy of peoples from the time\r\nthe United Nations was established, has followed with great\r\nconcern the events in East Timor. I sincerely hope that with\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations, the best solution will be\r\nfound to the problem, with the consecration of the rights of\r\nthis people, legitimized in the referendum and encouraged\r\nby our Organization.\r\nMy country has firmly decided to keep to the essential\r\nprinciples of coexistence and civilization; this is a necessary\r\nresult of its belonging to the international community.\r\nFollowing the principle of universality, Paraguay supports\r\nthe right of all the peoples of the world to make their\r\nvoices heard at the United Nations.\r\nParaguay believes that the situation in the China Strait\r\nmust be resolved within the framework of international law,\r\nnon-aggression and peaceful coexistence of nations.\r\nI cannot fail to state here that we share the sorrow of\r\nthe people of the Republic of China at the catastrophe\r\nafflicting its territory. We must all commit ourselves to\r\noffering cooperation and help to achieve its full recovery.\r\nIn my country there is an unswerving commitment to\r\ndemocracy and the belief that this can be consolidated only\r\nthrough justice, social equity, economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. That is why my Government has\r\nresolved to participate and act together with other countries\r\nin all efforts aimed at preserving natural resources and the\r\nenvironment, an indispensable task for comprehensive\r\ndevelopment. For the same reasons, in this year when\r\nhumanity will achieve the surprising figure of six billion\r\ninhabitants in the world, we, the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment and political leaders and officials have the\r\nhistoric responsibility to respond to the needs and\r\nexpectations of this huge world population. But let us not\r\ndo it with hunger, thirst, wars, terrorism, discrimination,\r\ngenocide, tyranny and injustice — let us do it with\r\nresponsibility, with positive actions, and with security for\r\nthe human person.\r\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, Paraguay is\r\nprepared to participate in this urgent task of improving\r\nhuman civilization.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Paraguay\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Luis Ángel González Macchi, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of\r\nthe Republic of Latvia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Latvia.\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia, Her Excellency Mrs.\r\nVaira Vike-Freiberga, and to invite her to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Vike-Freiberga (Latvia) (spoke in\r\nFrench): It is a great honour for me to address the\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session, and its President, Mr.\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab. You may be assured, Sir, of my\r\nhighest respect, and may I extend to you my best wishes\r\nfor success in your efforts.\r\nThis fifty-fourth Assembly, the last before the year\r\n2000, inevitably gives us food for thought. On the one\r\nhand, it urges us to turn to the achievements and the\r\nmajor successes of which the United Nations can rightly\r\nbe proud. On the other hand, it urges us to rise to all the\r\nchallenges which the new millennium will not fail to put\r\nbefore us. May our debates here help establish peace and\r\nsecurity throughout the world, settle conflicts and develop\r\ninnovative solutions to the problems we will have to face.\r\nThe noble ideals which have guided the United\r\nNations over the years have neither become outdated nor\r\nlost their relevance. Peace in the world, combating\r\npoverty, defending human rights — this is a programme\r\nwhich is still in force and whose goals could not be more\r\nclear-cut. It is rather like the struggle of the mythical hero\r\nagainst the Hydra: he cuts off one head and nine more\r\ngrow in its place. Nevertheless, we cannot possibly give\r\nup the fight and we must not drop our guard, not if the\r\nworld we wish to build is a civilized one.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe fifty-fourth General Assembly of the United\r\nNations is being held at a time when the United Nations\r\nsystem has experienced a certain amount of strain and is\r\nfaced with important challenges. These have given rise to\r\nquestions about the effectiveness and the very relevance of\r\nthis body within the contemporary international system.\r\nThis scepticism ranges from concerns about the capability\r\nof the Organization to address regional conflicts and the\r\nneeds of the developing world, to concerns about budgetary\r\nmanagement problems. No doubt there is some basis for\r\neach of those concerns. Nevertheless, they should not\r\nundermine the fundamental importance of a truly global\r\nOrganization which over a period of decades has earned\r\nrespect around the world. Our ranks are constantly growing,\r\nand the United Nations continues to approach the goal of\r\ntruly worldwide representation.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to congratulate the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga upon their admission to United Nations\r\nmembership.\r\nThe reform process of the United Nations is under\r\nway, and my country, Latvia, fully supports it. After all,\r\nMember States are the ones that set the agenda of the\r\nOrganization, and it will be the quality and commitment of\r\neach State that will ultimately determine the success or\r\nfailure of our common efforts.\r\nSome of the negative feelings about the United\r\nNations stem from excessive expectations. One cannot view\r\nthe United Nations as a panacea, particularly where\r\ndecisions on long-lasting regional problems are concerned\r\nor when preventive actions on a regional level are long\r\noverdue. Yet even in those situations a modern United\r\nNations system is expected to seek earlier and more\r\neffective involvement than was the case in South-East\r\nEurope, East Timor or the Middle East. It must be stressed\r\nthat the painful refugee crisis of Kosovo could not possibly\r\nbe resolved without the direct involvement of the United\r\nNations and its institutions. But, sadly, the maximum\r\npotential of the United Nations cannot always be utilized\r\nbecause of prejudice, lack of political will or perceived\r\npolitical ambitions. Let us not forget that the costs of our\r\nreluctance to take action are extremely high: too often our\r\nreluctance results in the deaths of innocent people and is\r\nthe cause of wholesale destruction which may take years\r\nand decades to remedy.\r\nThe topical issues of cooperation, conflict\r\nprevention, non-proliferation, arms control and\r\ndisarmament, humanitarian questions, environmental\r\nprotection, poverty eradication and gender equality need\r\nto be addressed on a global scale. Without a doubt, the\r\nUnited Nations and its institutions must play an\r\nincreasingly important role in resolving these issues.\r\nSince the mandate of the United Nations is to serve\r\nhumanity, the United Nations should observe the principle\r\nof universality. The United Nations capacity for conflict\r\nprevention and preventive diplomacy is by no means\r\nexhausted and further attention should be paid to fostering\r\nthe observance of these preventive principles throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nEven as we speak here today, many people in this\r\nworld are suffering at the hands of terrorists or live under\r\nterrorist threat. Any instances of terrorism should be\r\nuniversally condemned, and steps must be taken to\r\nstrengthen the international response to this problem.\r\nFor the United Nations to become a truly modern\r\nOrganization, it must reflect the new realities of a\r\nchanged international context. Reform of the Security\r\nCouncil remains central to the revitalization programme\r\nof the United Nations and should reflect both the needs of\r\nthe international community and present-day realities. The\r\nacquisition or possession of nuclear weapons must no\r\nlonger be the basis for super-Power status, and the future\r\nmodel of the Council will have to reflect this reality. That\r\nmodel should also make the Council more open to the\r\nviews and contributions of smaller States and non-\r\npermanent members.\r\nHow does Latvia see its contribution to the new\r\nUnited Nations? My country is one of those nations that\r\ncould not be a part of the United Nations at its inception;\r\nbecause freedom of choice was forbidden our people\r\nwhen Latvia lost its independence in 1940, we have\r\nspecial respect for this principle today. We also reserve a\r\nspecial place in our hearts for the United Nations because\r\nit was the first international Organization which we joined\r\nafter the restoration of independence in 1991. It was a\r\nmoment of celebration, pride and even euphoria as justice\r\nprevailed and a long struggle to join the community of\r\nnations finally came to an end.\r\nBut our people quickly realized that we were now\r\nsetting out along a new road. After a 50-year delay,\r\nLatvia was faced with the task of becoming an equal,\r\nresponsible and contributing member of a new Europe\r\nand a new, globalized international community.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nMembership in the United Nations was just the first\r\nstep along that road towards reasserting our national and\r\nour human rights. More importantly, we recognized our\r\nresponsibility to help other nations setting out on this path.\r\nYet, even at the very end of this century, we still\r\nencounter thinking which a priori denies the right of nations\r\nto choose their own destiny. Thankfully, such views are\r\nbecoming less and less acceptable as the years go by. For\r\nLatvia, as a free and sovereign nation, the last few years\r\nhave been a remarkably successful period of active\r\nintegration into the international community, of internal\r\nrestructuring, of wide-ranging reforms and societal\r\nregeneration. Fifty years of occupation have left us with a\r\nheavy social, economic and psychological legacy, but we\r\nhave made tremendous efforts to overcome this in every\r\nway. The support offered by the United Nations in this\r\nonerous task has been of enormous significance and I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to reiterate the heartfelt\r\nappreciation of Latvia for the invaluable assistance provided\r\nby the United Nations.\r\nDuring this century Latvia has made a remarkable\r\nturnaround. It has gone from the depths of tragedy to the\r\nheights of success. In a few short years, Latvia has grown\r\ninto a politically stable State with strong democratic\r\ninstitutions and practices. Latvia has restored a thriving\r\nmarket economy and a deep respect for individual rights\r\nand freedoms. Over the past few years and with the help of\r\nthe international community, Latvia has attached particular\r\nimportance to the process of forming a fully integrated,\r\nharmonious society. It is a challenging but critically\r\nimportant task for my country, the more so because of the\r\nburdens imposed by our historical legacy. We perceive it as\r\nan ongoing process that involves many cultural and\r\neducational aspects and includes the important element of\r\nthe individual’s right to choose. Our goal is to give each\r\nresident of our country an equal opportunity to contribute\r\nto a civic identity that shares common goals and values\r\nwith all Europe. As part of this programme, my country\r\nwill continue to attach particular importance to\r\nstrengthening the role of the Latvian language and\r\nincorporating minorities into the everyday affairs of the\r\ncountry.\r\nLatvia believes in complementarity between regional\r\nand global efforts. For Latvia, integration into Europe\r\nremains a high priority but it is not the end of the road.\r\nIntegration into the transatlantic security alliance would be\r\na prudent step but not a sufficient one. For Latvia to\r\nsucceed, and for the people of Latvia to have the full\r\nopportunity they deserve to live secure, healthy and\r\nprosperous lives, Latvia must be integrated into the\r\npolitical, business and intellectual exchange of the global\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe are very proud that on 10 February 1999 Latvia\r\nbecame the first Baltic State to join the World Trade\r\nOrganization as a full-fledged member.\r\nWithin the range of its capabilities, Latvia has\r\nparticipated in peace operations in the Balkans and has\r\ncontributed to relieving the suffering of Kosovo refugees.\r\nLatvia has been an active contributor to United\r\nNations revitalization through its membership in the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nLatvia has put forward its candidature for the\r\nSecurity Council elections in 2005. This spring my\r\ncountry signed the Statute of the International Criminal\r\nCourt and is currently planning the ratification process.\r\nA very visible indication of our appreciation of the\r\nwork of the United Nations and a concrete manifestation\r\nof Latvia’s support for the Secretary General’s\r\nprogramme for United Nations reform is our donation of\r\na historic, fully renovated building in the centre of our\r\ncapital as a shared home for all United Nations agencies\r\nin Latvia. On 16 July this year, and as one of my first\r\nofficial functions as President, I had the pleasure of\r\nparticipating in the official inauguration of the United\r\nNations House in Riga, one of the first United Nations\r\nHouses in Europe and the very first in our region.\r\nI should like to express my country’s full support for\r\nthe proposed Millennium Assembly of 2000 and trust that\r\nit will become a landmark in setting our sights for the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nMay the results of the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly advance our common cause at the\r\ndawn of the new millennium.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI thank the President of the Republic of Latvia for the\r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Vice-Chancellor and\r\nFederal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Joschka Fischer.\r\nMr. Fischer (Germany) (spoke in German; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): First of all, I would like\r\nto warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly and to wish you every success in this difficult\r\noffice.\r\nI should also like to thank Foreign Minister Opertti for\r\nhis tireless dedication in successfully presiding over the\r\nfifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nI welcome Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga, with which\r\nGermany has long enjoyed friendly ties, as new Members\r\nof the world Organization.\r\nI endorse the statement of my Finnish colleague, Tarja\r\nHalonen, on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is the last in\r\nthis “century of extremes”, as the British historian Eric\r\nHobsbawm called the century now drawing to a close. That\r\nis reason enough to take stock. Since its foundation, the\r\nUnited Nations has greatly enhanced relations between\r\npeoples. The development of international law, protection\r\nof human rights, decolonization, worldwide humanitarian\r\nand disaster aid, arousing awareness of the great problems\r\nfacing mankind, such as population growth, poverty and the\r\nglobal environmental crisis — all of this would be\r\ninconceivable without the United Nations.\r\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations\r\nobjectives and values — peace, human rights, freedom,\r\njustice and development — and they have gained\r\nworldwide recognition, even if, unfortunately, they are not\r\nalways respected everywhere. Nevertheless, even after more\r\nthan 50 years, there is still a long way to go before they are\r\nuniversally respected and implemented. Despite all its\r\nefforts, the international community has not yet succeeded\r\nin ridding our planet of war, oppression, tyranny, expulsion\r\nand grave human rights violations, including genocide. At\r\nthe close of this century, the United Nations and its\r\nMember States are unable to fully master their core task,\r\nnamely, safeguarding peace and security. The great hope\r\nthat following the end of the East-West conflict the era of\r\nmultilateral cooperation and worldwide rule of law would\r\ndawn has not yet come to fruition.\r\nToday the question of peacekeeping must be\r\nconsidered under conditions very different to those during\r\nthe United Nations early years. First, most conflicts today\r\nare internal rather than international, as in earlier times.\r\nSecondly, the role of the nation State has been\r\nconsiderably relativized by the increased importance of\r\nhuman rights and the globalization of the economy and\r\nsociety. Against this background, the question of\r\npeacekeeping arises more and more in an area of tension\r\nbetween traditional State sovereignty and protection of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWhat is to be done when entire States collapse and\r\nthe civilian population is massacred in never-ending civil\r\nwars from all sides? What if ethnic tensions in a State are\r\npartly provoked by criminal Governments, which then\r\nrespond with pogroms, mass expulsions and mass\r\nmurders, even genocide? Should the United Nations then\r\nregard State sovereignty as more important than\r\nprotection of individuals and their rights? Rwanda,\r\nKosovo and East Timor are dramatic examples of this.\r\nIn many ways, therefore, the Kosovo conflict\r\nrepresents a turning point. The international community\r\ncould no longer tolerate a State waging war against its\r\nown people and using terror and expulsion as a political\r\ninstrument. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his\r\nbrilliant and trail-blazing speech to the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the Commission on Human Rights, no Government has\r\nthe right to use the cover of the principle of State\r\nsovereignty to violate human rights. Non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs must no longer be misused as a shield for\r\ndictators and murderers. The World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights in Vienna reaffirmed this in 1993, with the\r\napproval of all United Nations Members States, with the\r\nwords:\r\n“the promotion and protection of all human rights is\r\na legitimate concern of the international\r\ncommunity”. (Vienna Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action, I, para. 4)\r\nHowever, the Kosovo conflict also marks a change\r\nof direction in the development of international relations.\r\nHow will the international community decide in the\r\nfuture — this question has just been raised once more in\r\nEast Timor — when it comes to preventing massive\r\nhuman rights violations against an entire people? Two\r\ndevelopments are conceivable.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nA practice of humanitarian interventions could evolve\r\noutside the United Nations system. This would be a very\r\nproblematic development. The intervention in Kosovo,\r\nwhich took place in a situation where the Security Council\r\nhad tied its own hands after all efforts to find a peaceful\r\nsolution had failed, was intended to provide emergency\r\nassistance and, ultimately, to protect the displaced Kosovo\r\nAlbanians. The unity of the European States and the\r\nWestern Alliance, as well as various Security Council\r\nresolutions, were of crucial significance here. However, this\r\nstep, which is only justified in this special situation, must\r\nnot set a precedent for weakening the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council\u0027s monopoly on authorizing the use of legal\r\ninternational force. Nor must it become a licence to use\r\nexternal force under the pretext of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThis would open the door to the arbitrary use of power and\r\nanarchy and throw the world back to the nineteenth century.\r\nThe only solution to this dilemma, therefore, is to\r\nfurther develop the existing United Nations system in such\r\na way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time\r\nin cases of very grave human rights violations, but not until\r\nall means of settling conflicts peacefully have been\r\nexhausted and — this is a crucial point — within a strictly\r\nlimited legal and controlled framework.\r\nIn the twenty-first century the individual and his rights\r\nmust take a more prominent place alongside the rights of\r\nStates in the concept of security as defined by the\r\ninternational community. The reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, the central body for safeguarding world peace,\r\nmust be oriented towards this principle. The Security\r\nCouncil is, in fact, authorized to act, and able to do so,\r\nwhere peace or security are at risk due to internal\r\ndevelopments. This has been demonstrated by a long chain\r\nof decisions, from the apartheid resolution to the\r\ninterventions in Iraq, Bosnia and Haiti. However, in\r\nRwanda, Kosovo and the Congo, decision making in the\r\nSecurity Council was blocked, thus rendering it unable to\r\nlive up to its responsibilities enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter, with disastrous results for the peoples in\r\nquestion.\r\nThese conflicts are a pressing reason, particularly in\r\nview of the important Millennium General Assembly, to\r\nfinally carry out the long-overdue substantial reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council must be adapted to\r\nthe new realities of the global political situation. It must\r\nhave a more representative composition and, above all, it\r\nmust be equipped to react to the crises and conflicts of\r\ntoday. Reform must involve enlargement to include both\r\nmore permanent and non-permanent members, as well as a\r\nstrengthening of its decision-making powers. As the\r\nAssembly knows, Germany has for some time now\r\nexpressed its willingness to assume more and lasting\r\nresponsibility in this connection. We stand by this\r\nunreservedly.\r\nIn the debate on reform we must not avoid the issue\r\nof the permanent members\u0027 right of veto, a question of\r\nkey importance for the Security Council\u0027s capability to\r\nact. The right of veto is regarded by many as outdated in\r\nits current form. However, it is a situation with which we\r\nhave to reckon internationally for a long time to come.\r\nHow then can decision-making in the Security Council be\r\nmade more efficient?\r\nAccording to the Charter, the Security Council acts\r\nwith the mandate, and on behalf, of all United Nations\r\nMember States. But hitherto they have not been entitled\r\nto learn why a State has exercised its right of veto. This\r\nis not only neither democratic nor transparent, but also\r\nmakes it easier for States to veto a draft resolution\r\nunilaterally for national rather than international interests.\r\nThe introduction of an obligation for a State to explain to\r\nthe General Assembly why it is vetoing a draft resolution\r\nwould make it more difficult to do so and thus bring\r\nabout substantial progress towards using the right of veto\r\nmore responsibly. Why should not the General Assembly\r\nassume more responsibility in the future, too?\r\nA second approach to making the international\r\npeacekeeping system more efficient would be via Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter, namely by\r\nstrengthening the regional security systems and\r\nredistributing tasks and areas of responsibility among\r\nthem and the United Nations. It is becoming clear that the\r\nregional organizations could be allocated an even greater\r\nimplementation role. This would also foster the\r\ncapabilities of regional organizations to engage in security\r\ncooperation, as well as their collaboration with the United\r\nNations. However, the primacy of the Security Council\r\nremains absolutely essential.\r\nWithout reforms in the area of peacekeeping, the\r\nSecurity Council will be circumvented more and more\r\nfrequently, resulting in the erosion of the Security Council\r\nand, ultimately, of the entire United Nations system. The\r\nUnited Nations, one of civilization\u0027s greatest achievements\r\nthis century, as well as the values and principles it\r\nrepresents, would thus be at risk of subsiding into\r\ninsignificance. We must prevent that.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThe disaster in East Timor is currently demonstrating\r\nhow necessary close cooperation is between a Security\r\nCouncil capable of taking action and the countries in the\r\nregion. The Security Council\u0027s mandate to send a\r\nmultilateral peacekeeping force must be fully implemented.\r\nIndonesia must now cooperate closely with the United\r\nNations Mission and do everything in its power to\r\nguarantee its success. The bloodshed must end. The victims\r\nmust be helped. Those displaced must be able to return\r\nhome safely. Germany has already provided humanitarian\r\nand food aid. We will send a medical corps to assist the\r\npeacekeeping troops and make further contributions towards\r\nrebuilding the destroyed country. I am confident that our\r\nParliament will lend this plan its full backing.\r\nIn Africa, the Great Lakes region, the Congo and\r\nSierra Leone have for many years been the scene of terrible\r\nwars, mass murders, destruction and much suffering on the\r\npart of refugees. The Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nand the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and its Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) have\r\ndone much to contain and resolve these conflicts. However,\r\nthese organizations also need the support of the United\r\nNations, in Sierra Leone, in the Congo and, in particular, in\r\nthe conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Both parties to\r\nthe conflict must observe the agreements concluded and\r\nwork closely together with the United Nations and the OAU\r\nso that the peace process now begun can be brought to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\r\nThe international community must focus on the causes\r\nrather than merely the symptoms of wars and conflicts in\r\nthe context of multilateral peacekeeping. Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan rightly called for a “culture of prevention” to\r\nbe developed in order to prevent the outbreak of wars and\r\navert natural disasters more effectively in future.\r\nEveryone knows how difficult the transition from the\r\n“culture of reaction” to the “culture of prevention” will be.\r\nIt takes a lot of persuading to summon up the political and\r\neconomic will for measures intended to prevent something\r\nwhich we hope will never happen. However, on financial\r\ngrounds and, above all, on humanitarian grounds, it is our\r\nduty and responsibility to revise our thinking here. Progress\r\nis urgently required in four areas.\r\nFirst, we must move on from early warning to early\r\nresponse. The United Nations has considerable resources at\r\nits disposal for preventive diplomacy, which must be used\r\neven more. There is also a great potential for synergy in\r\ncooperation with non-governmental organizations.\r\nSecondly, peacekeeping operations must be carried\r\nout before conflicts erupt. The United Nations mission in\r\nMacedonia has set a standard in this respect.\r\nThirdly, disarmament and the non-proliferation of\r\nmeans of mass destruction are in need of fresh political\r\nimpetus. It is essential that the Geneva negotiations gain\r\nmomentum, particularly in the fields of global nuclear\r\ndisarmament and the verification of biological weapons,\r\nand in the implementation of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention. Furthermore, Germany advocates the\r\nadoption of a convention on preventing the illegal transfer\r\nof small arms worldwide.\r\nFourthly, peace-building is a prevention task of\r\ngrowing importance. With the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the United\r\nNations is facing one of the most comprehensive tests in\r\nits history. Building public order by creating an efficient\r\njudicial system and quickly sending the pledged\r\ninternational police units is now crucial. Since the United\r\nNations began incorporating national police units in the\r\ninternational standby system, they have been able to act\r\nmore swiftly. We must continue along this path.\r\nProtection of human rights and the growing\r\ndemocratization of States form the basis for a preventive\r\npeace policy and civil conflict management. It is a\r\nhistorical fact that democracies with a well-developed\r\ncivil society hardly ever wage war against each other.\r\nLasting economic success cannot be achieved in the\r\nglobalized information society of tomorrow without good\r\ngovernance founded on human rights, the separation of\r\npowers and a functioning legal and constitutional\r\nframework.\r\nIn the field of human rights, welcome progress has\r\nbeen made towards broadening the legal basis for\r\ninternational relations, particularly during the last year.\r\nThe detention of Pinochet and the indictment of Milosevic\r\nby the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia are milestones along the path towards creating\r\na world in which the rule of law prevails. In future,\r\ndictators and perpetrators of human rights violations will\r\nno longer be able to rely on not being called to account\r\nfor their actions. This must also apply to the murderers of\r\nDili and those who issued the orders. Just like everywhere\r\nelse in the world, internal peace is contingent upon\r\njustice.\r\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court represented a quantum leap in the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\ndevelopment of international law. I call upon all States to\r\nrespect the integrity of the Rome Statute, to sign it and to\r\nswiftly ratify it, so that the Court can commence work next\r\nyear.\r\nGermany is doing all it can to bring about progress in\r\nthe following fields of human rights. The heinous crimes of\r\nchild trafficking and child prostitution must be banned\r\nthroughout the world, as must the use of child soldiers. In\r\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts,\r\nthe age limit must be raised to 18.\r\nIn many countries women are still largely without\r\nrights and protection and subjected to discrimination and\r\nviolence. This is an unacceptable injustice. Unfortunately,\r\nour world is still a long way from genuine equality, even\r\nwith regard to fundamental rights. We must therefore aim\r\nto adopt the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the\r\nElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.\r\nIn our view, the death penalty cannot be justified\r\neither ethically or legally. Together with its European\r\npartners, Germany will therefore continue to vigorously\r\nwork towards ensuring the implementation of the joint\r\nresolution on abolishing the death penalty.\r\nProtection of press freedom must be improved. The\r\nfreedom to inform is a reliable gauge of respect for human\r\nrights. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights guarantees the right to freedom of opinion.\r\nHowever, censorship, intimidation and reprisals are the\r\norder of the day in many countries. It is particularly\r\nshocking that year after year dozens of journalists are killed\r\nwhile on assignment. The United Nations should take a\r\ncloser look at this issue and consider practical solutions as\r\nwell as enhance legal protection for journalists. To this end\r\nwe will shortly be extending invitations to a conference to\r\nbe held in Germany.\r\nThe United Nations third major task alongside\r\npeacekeeping and promoting human rights in the coming\r\ncentury will be to bring about a reconciliation between rich\r\nand poor countries.\r\nThe tenth Human Development Report of the United\r\nNations Development Programme came to the sad\r\nconclusion that globalization has further widened the gap\r\nbetween rich and poor countries. The international\r\ncommunity must endeavour to counter this trend. The\r\ndevelopment of the poorer and the poorest countries must\r\nnot be left to the invisible hand of the global market. The\r\nindividual, not the market, must be the focus of the\r\nglobalization debate. This will also require greater\r\nsteering at the political level.\r\nThe rich countries have a responsibility to help poor\r\ncountries take advantage of globalization and enable them\r\nto have a fairer share of the world economy by assisting\r\nthem with internal reforms and by opening up markets.\r\nWithin the framework of its European Union and Group\r\nof 8 presidencies, Germany launched substantial\r\ninitiatives, which must be further developed in the form\r\nof the 1999 Köln Debt Initiative and the commencement\r\nof negotiations on a follow-up arrangement for the Lomé\r\nConvention.\r\nDevelopment cooperation in the broadest sense must\r\nbecome one of the United Nations core tasks to a greater\r\ndegree than hitherto. Science and technology are geared\r\nfar too much to the problems of rich countries. Why do\r\nwe not make greater use of the United Nations framework\r\nto build bridges here? The economist Jeffrey Sachs made\r\nthe interesting suggestion, for example, that a millennium\r\nvaccine fund could be established, with guaranteed\r\nmarkets in the future for vaccines against tropical viruses\r\nsuch as tuberculosis, malaria and, above all, AIDS.\r\nFurthermore, in the context of the emergence of a global\r\nknowledge society, the international regime for the\r\nprotection of intellectual property must be revised in order\r\nto ensure that the world’s poor do not lose a large part of\r\ntheir rights and freedoms in the near future. Rich and\r\npoor countries should get together with one another more\r\nfrequently to discuss such proposals. During its\r\npresidency of the Group of Eight, Germany made a start\r\nby meeting the non-aligned countries and the Group of\r\n77.\r\nThe destruction of the environment has long since\r\nceased to be a soft issue, but, rather, has become a very\r\nhard question which will have an increasingly strong\r\nimpact on international security. According to the new\r\nstudy by the United Nations Environment Programme\r\n(UNEP), global warming and water shortages will be the\r\nbiggest problems facing humanity in the coming century.\r\nUNEP also rightly draws attention to the close connection\r\nbetween environmental destruction, poverty and excessive\r\nconsumption. The deadlock in the climate protection\r\nnegotiations must finally be overcome and the Kyoto\r\nProtocol implemented. The destruction of the rain forest\r\nmust be stopped and further desertification prevented, and\r\nwe must halt the squandering of our planet’s natural\r\nresources and switch to renewable energy as quickly as\r\npossible. The world does not have much time left to\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nremap a course towards sustainability. This will also require\r\na much more active population policy, including a\r\nlong-term strategy to deal with the ageing of our world’s\r\npopulation. The International Plan of Action on Ageing,\r\nadopted in 1982, is in need of urgent revision. We intend\r\nto hold a ministerial conference in Germany on this issue\r\nunder the auspices of the Economic Commission for\r\nEurope.\r\nWith the leap into the next millennium, the nation\r\nState principle will continue to diminish in importance. It\r\nwill no longer be possible to find answers to major global\r\nproblems within the framework of the traditional nation\r\nstate. Rather, this will take place in a strengthened\r\ninternational structure and with a transfer of power to\r\ninternational organizations, with the United Nations at their\r\nhead. This will entail a transformation of traditional power\r\ninto justice, the reconciliation of interests and a greater role\r\nfor civil society in the international political system, with\r\nthe ever-greater involvement of representatives of civil\r\nsociety and industry. Reaching agreement on minimum\r\nstandards with regard to social issues — on the issue of\r\nchild labour, for example — will be possible in many cases\r\nonly in a global context. I support the proposal put forward\r\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on\r\ncommon values and principles be concluded within the\r\nframework of a public/private partnership, between the\r\nUnited Nations and major companies, in order to lend the\r\nlaw of the market a human face.\r\nThe United Nations must become the core of effective\r\nglobal governance. Strengthening the United Nations, which\r\nmust begin by guaranteeing its financial basis, is therefore\r\none of Germany’s most important foreign policy objectives.\r\nDuring the past 50 years, and for the first time in its\r\nhistory, Germany has been opting wholeheartedly for\r\nintegration into multilateral structures, thereby achieving\r\ndemocracy, freedom and reunification. Today, out of a\r\nsense of deep conviction and historical responsibility, our\r\ncountry is committed to peaceful reconciliation of interests\r\nand to multilateralism. We are taking this conviction with\r\nus to our old and new capital, Berlin. In the international\r\nState system of tomorrow the answer to the challenges of\r\nglobalization will come from multilateralism alone. Our\r\nworld will always be plural, and no form of unilateralism\r\ncan therefore work in the long run. For that reason, the\r\ntwenty-first century, with its more than 6 billion people and\r\ntheir States, will need a United Nations that is capable of\r\ntaking action. The United Nations and its Members can\r\ntherefore be certain that we Germans will be their\r\nstaunchest allies in the efforts to strengthen the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of China, Mr. Tang Jiaxuan, on whom I\r\nnow call.\r\nMr. Tang Jiaxuan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nPlease allow me to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nthis session. I am confident that with your wisdom and\r\nexperience, you will be able to accomplish your lofty\r\nmission successfully. At the same time, I would like to\r\nexpress my appreciation to Mr. Opertti for the\r\ncontribution he made as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its previous session. I also wish to take this\r\nopportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga on their admission to the membership\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is of\r\nspecial significance, as it is the last one of this century. A\r\nreview of the past may help us predict the future. In\r\nretrospect, during the past century humanity, on the one\r\nhand, created unprecedented material wealth and culture\r\nand, on the other, suffered from the scourge of two world\r\nwars and the ordeal of the cold war, which lasted for\r\nalmost 50 years. Since the end of the cold war, the world\r\nhas been moving towards multipolarity and the overall\r\ninternational situation has started to relax. The\r\nmaintenance of peace, the pursuit of stability and the\r\npromotion of development have become the common\r\naspiration and demand of the people of all countries.\r\nNevertheless, the harsh reality suggests that the world is\r\nfar from tranquil. The cold-war mentality still lingers on.\r\nHegemonism and power politics have manifested\r\nthemselves in new expressions. Military blocs are being\r\nexpanded and reinforced, and there is an increasing\r\ntendency towards military intervention. Triggered by\r\nethnic, religious and territorial issues, regional conflicts\r\nand disputes continue to emerge one after another. The\r\nconflict between the North and the South has become\r\never more acute. The gap between the rich and the poor\r\ncontinues to grow. World peace is still elusive, and\r\ndevelopment faces even more serious challenges.\r\nHegemonism and power politics are the root causes\r\nof the turmoil in today’s world. The outbreak of war in\r\nKosovo sounded a resounding alarm. A regional military\r\norganization, in the name of humanitarianism and human\r\nrights, bypassed the United Nations to take large-scale\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nmilitary actions against a sovereign State, thus creating an\r\nominous precedent in international relations. This act was\r\na violation of the United Nations Charter and other\r\nuniversally recognized norms governing international\r\nrelations. It has eroded the leading role of the United\r\nNations in safeguarding world peace and security and\r\ngravely undermined the authority of the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council. During that war, the Chinese Embassy in\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was bombed, which\r\ncaused heavy casualties and much loss of property. It was\r\nan incident such as has rarely been seen in diplomatic\r\nhistory, and naturally roused the utmost indignation of the\r\nentire Chinese people and the strong condemnation of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council,\r\nChina has held a clear and consistent position on the issue\r\nof Kosovo. We seek no selfish interests and are only\r\nupholding justice. For the sake of peace, we maintain that\r\nthe Kosovo issue should be resolved through peaceful\r\nnegotiations on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nand with guarantees of the legitimate rights and interest of\r\nall ethnic groups in Kosovo. We are opposed to the use of\r\nforce under any pretext.\r\nMankind is on the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Where should the world go? What kind of new\r\ninternational political and economic order should be\r\nestablished? These are urgent questions facing the\r\nGovernments and the peoples of all countries.\r\nThe world is undergoing significant and profound\r\nchanges. A changed world calls for a corresponding new\r\ninternational political and economic order. World peace and\r\ndevelopment demand the establishment of a just and\r\nreasonable new international order, which is the common\r\naspiration of the international community. It should be\r\nbased on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\nother universally recognized principles governing\r\ninternational relations. In this connection, I wish to\r\nhighlight the following points.\r\nThe first relates to sovereign equality and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of others. Such arguments\r\nas human rights taking precedence over sovereignty and\r\nhumanitarian intervention seem to be in vogue these days.\r\nSome countries have even put such arguments into practice.\r\nWe believe that it is the sacred duty of all Governments to\r\npromote and protect human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, and that all countries have an obligation to\r\npromote and protect the human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms of their own peoples in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational human rights instruments, and in the light of\r\ntheir respective national conditions and relevant laws. But\r\nas political systems, levels of economic development,\r\nhistory, cultural background and values vary from country\r\nto country, it is only natural that countries should have\r\ndifferent interpretations and even diverging views on\r\nhuman rights. Countries should engage in dialogue and\r\nexchanges on the basis of equality and mutual respect so\r\nas to better understand each other, expand common\r\nground and handle their differences properly, rather than\r\nresort to confrontation or interference in the internal\r\naffairs of others under the pretext of human rights.\r\nThe issue of human rights is, in essence, the internal\r\naffair of a given country, and should be addressed mainly\r\nby the Government of that country through its own\r\nefforts. Ours is a diversified world. Each country has the\r\nright to choose its own social system, approach to\r\ndevelopment and values that are suited to its national\r\nconditions. The history of China and other developing\r\ncountries shows that a country’s sovereignty is the\r\nprerequisite for and the basis of the human rights that the\r\npeople of that country can enjoy. When the sovereignty\r\nof a country is put in jeopardy, its human rights can\r\nhardly be protected effectively. Sovereign equality, mutual\r\nrespect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of others are the basic principles governing\r\ninternational relations today. In spite of the major changes\r\nin the post-cold-war international situation, these\r\nprinciples are by no means out of date. Any deviation\r\nfrom or violation of these principles would destroy the\r\nuniversally recognized norms governing international\r\nrelations, and would lead to the rule of hegemonism; if\r\nthe notion of “might is right” should prevail, a new gun-\r\nboat policy would wreak havoc, the sovereignty and\r\nindependence by virtue of which some small and weak\r\ncountries protect themselves would be jeopardized and\r\ninternational peace and stability would be seriously\r\nendangered.\r\nThe Kosovo crisis has proved that to engage in so-\r\ncalled humanitarian intervention in a sovereign State with\r\nneither a mandate from the Security Council nor the prior\r\nconsent of the country concerned will cause a greater\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe instead of resolving the problem.\r\nIn view of this, under the current circumstances, the\r\nprinciples of respect for State sovereignty and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of others must be\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\neffectively strengthened rather than weakened in order to\r\nmaintain world peace and stability.\r\nThe second principle is the pacific settlement of\r\ninternational disputes. This principle, initiated by the Hague\r\npeace conference 100 years ago, is now an important\r\nprinciple of the United Nations Charter and a basic\r\nprinciple of contemporary international law. History shows\r\nthat deviation from this principle over the past century has\r\nled to, “the scourge of war, which twice ... has brought\r\nuntold sorrow to mankind”, and to foreign aggression,\r\nwhich has inflicted tremendous suffering on the peoples of\r\na number of countries. In the current international situation,\r\nadherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of\r\ninternational disputes is still highly relevant to the\r\ncontemporary world.\r\nThe pacific settlement of international disputes is\r\npredicated on the non-use and non-threat of force in\r\ninternational relations. We maintain that handling State-to-\r\nState relations with the mentality and modalities of “hot”\r\nwars, cold wars, power politics or bloc politics will get\r\nnowhere. All international disputes and regional conflicts\r\nshould be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner through\r\npeaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis of\r\nequality, rather than through the arbitrary use or threat of\r\nforce based on the power of military superiority. Only in\r\nthis way can fundamental solutions to disputes or conflicts\r\nbe found without complicating or aggravating them or\r\nleaving behind a hidden peril. And only in this way can\r\nStates coexist in harmony and achieve common\r\ndevelopment. This is the only way to lasting peace and\r\nstability in the world. Otherwise, the world will never be a\r\ntranquil place.\r\nThe third principle relates to strengthening the role of\r\nthe United Nations and preserving the authority of the\r\nSecurity Council. The role of the United Nations is\r\nindispensable for the achievement of genuine peace and\r\ndevelopment and for the establishment of a just and\r\nreasonable new international order. Strengthening the role\r\nof the United Nations is in line with the historical trend; it\r\nmeets the needs of the times and conforms to the shared\r\naspiration of all the world’s peoples. In order to strengthen\r\nthe role of the United Nations, efforts should first be made\r\nto uphold the sanctity of the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter. The most important reason why the United Nations\r\nhas been able to grow from 51 founding Members to its\r\ncurrent size is that it has acted according to these purposes\r\nand principles. Those purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations have already taken deep root in\r\ninternational practice and form a legal basis on which\r\npeaceful and friendly relations between countries are\r\nguided. It is the view of the Chinese Government that\r\ndespite the great changes that have taken place in the\r\ninternational situation, the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter are still relevant. We are opposed\r\nto any irresponsible interpretation or revision of them,\r\nwith whatever excuse.\r\nIf the United Nations role is to be strengthened, the\r\nauthority of the Security Council must be preserved.\r\nAccording to the provisions of the Charter, the Security\r\nCouncil shoulders primary responsibility for safeguarding\r\ninternational peace and security. It has been proved that\r\nthe role of the Security Council is irreplaceable. Given\r\nthe current circumstances, it is imperative to preserve its\r\nauthority and leading role. Any act to weaken this\r\nauthority or to impose the will of an individual country or\r\na group of countries on the Security Council is very\r\ndangerous. Instead of contributing to the maintenance of\r\npeace, it will further breed power politics and\r\nhegemonism and will give rise to endless troubles.\r\nIf the United Nations role is to be strengthened, it is\r\nessential to ensure that all Member States have the right\r\nto equal participation in international affairs, so that their\r\nreasonable propositions will be fully reflected and their\r\nlegitimate rights and interests protected by the United\r\nNations. Decisions adopted by the United Nations must\r\ngive expression to the common will of the majority of its\r\nMember States. Any attempt by a few countries or a\r\ngroup of countries to monopolize world affairs and decide\r\nthe destiny of the people of other countries goes against\r\nthe trend of the times and will never succeed.\r\nFourthly, we must foster a new security concept and\r\nsafeguard international security. The old security concept\r\nis based on military alliance and arms build-up and does\r\nnot help safeguard international security, still less build a\r\nlasting peace in the world. In today’s world it is\r\nnecessary to foster a new security concept that satisfies\r\nthe needs of the times and to explore new ways of\r\nmaintaining peace and security. The core of the new\r\nsecurity concept should be mutual trust, mutual benefit,\r\nequality and cooperation. The Five Principles of Peaceful\r\nCoexistence and the purposes of the United Nations\r\nCharter are the political foundation for the maintenance of\r\ninternational security, while mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation and common development constitute its\r\neconomic guarantee. Dialogue on an equal footing, full\r\nconsultation and peaceful negotiations are the right way\r\nto maintain international security.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nRelaxation in the international situation and the\r\ndisarmament process are complementary to each other. It is\r\nregrettable, however, that some recent negative\r\ndevelopments in the international situation have seriously\r\nhindered the healthy development of the disarmament\r\nprocess. How to promote the disarmament process, prevent\r\nan arms race and safeguard international security have\r\nbecome pressing concerns for the international community.\r\nWe are opposed to any attempt, on the basis of excuses that\r\nare not genuine, to seek military strength that goes beyond\r\na country’s legitimate defence needs. We are also opposed\r\nto any attempt to restrict and weaken other countries in the\r\nname of disarmament and non-proliferation in order to seek\r\nabsolute, unilateral security supremacy for one country or\r\ngroup of countries. We call on the international community\r\nto take the new security concept as a guideline and\r\nwholeheartedly promote the healthy development of the\r\ndisarmament process, in the interest of world peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nFifthly, we must reform the international economic\r\nsystem and promote the common development of all\r\ncountries. The old and irrational economic order has\r\nseriously impeded the sound development of the world\r\neconomy, further widening the wealth gap between the\r\nNorth and the South. The East Asian financial crisis that\r\nbroke out two years ago has affected many countries in the\r\nworld. To prevent financial risks and ensure economic\r\nsecurity has become an urgent task facing many countries,\r\nespecially the developing countries. The world economy is\r\nan interrelated and indivisible whole. All members of the\r\ninternational community should take a responsible approach\r\nand, in a spirit of risk sharing, strengthen their cooperation\r\nand jointly promote a steady growth of the world economy.\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to reform the current\r\ninternational economic and financial systems. The United\r\nNations and the international financial institutions should\r\nearnestly construct a framework to prevent and overcome\r\nfinancial and other economic risks. Accordingly, the\r\ndeveloped countries should take on more obligations. The\r\ndeveloping countries have the right to equal participation in\r\nworld economic decision-making and the formulation of\r\nrelevant rules. In the new round of negotiations that will\r\nsoon begin in the World Trade Organization, the reasonable\r\ndemands of developing countries should be fully reflected.\r\nCooperation should be strengthened on the basis of mutual\r\nbenefit. No country should prejudice other countries’\r\neconomic security and development by virtue of its\r\neconomic, technological and financial advantages. We\r\nshould all oppose trade discrimination, the rich bullying the\r\npoor and the arbitrary resort to economic sanctions or the\r\nthreat of sanctions against other countries. The developed\r\nand developing countries both have their own advantages\r\nand should learn from each other to make up for their\r\ndeficiencies so as to achieve common sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMoreover, on such global issues as the environment,\r\npopulation, poverty and debt the developed countries\r\nshould not shirk their responsibility and obligation; rather,\r\nthey should take the lead in providing technological and\r\nfinancial assistance to the developing countries. We deem\r\nit necessary for the United Nations to hold a special\r\nconference at an appropriate time to discuss the\r\nglobalization of the world economy, in order to promote\r\ninternational cooperation in this field and to achieve\r\ncommon prosperity.\r\nThe People’s Republic of China will soon celebrate\r\nits fiftieth anniversary. For half a century, especially in\r\nthe last 21 years of reform and opening-up, earth-shaking\r\nchanges have taken place in China, and the Chinese\r\npeople have scored tremendous achievements in socialist\r\neconomic, political and cultural development as well as in\r\ndiplomatic and other endeavours. Following Hong Kong’s\r\nreturn to the motherland the year before last, the Chinese\r\nGovernment will soon resume the exercise of sovereignty\r\nover Macao. At present, China enjoys political stability,\r\nsustained economic growth, national unity, social\r\ntranquillity and progress. Although difficulties and serious\r\nchallenges still lie ahead, we are confident and capable of\r\novercoming the difficulties, rising to the challenges and\r\nforging ahead with every aspect of the socialist cause of\r\nbuilding a strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally\r\nadvanced country.\r\nIn the face of international vicissitudes, the Chinese\r\nGovernment will steadfastly take up economic\r\ndevelopment as the central task, resolutely press ahead\r\nwith reform and opening up, consistently maintain social\r\nstability and unswervingly pursue an independent foreign\r\npolicy of peace. We are willing to continue to develop\r\nfriendly relations and cooperation on the basis of the five\r\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence with all other countries\r\nin the world and to make our due contribution to\r\nsafeguarding world peace and promoting common\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Chinese Government and people will, as always,\r\nresolutely safeguard China\u0027s sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity and will continue to advance the great cause of\r\nnational reunification. It is a fact universally recognized\r\nby the international community that there is only one\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nChina in the world, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of\r\nChinese territory and that the Government of the People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of China is the sole legitimate government\r\nrepresenting the whole of China. China\u0027s territory and\r\nsovereignty are absolutely indivisible. The ultimate\r\nreunification of the motherland represents the common\r\naspiration and firm resolve of all the Chinese people,\r\nincluding our compatriots on Taiwan. No force can hold us\r\nback in this great cause.\r\nThe Chinese Government will continue to adhere to its\r\nestablished policy for settling the question of Taiwan. We\r\nare firmly opposed to any efforts to create “independence\r\nfor Taiwan”, “two Chinas”, or “one China, one Taiwan”.\r\nAll moves to divide the motherland are doomed to failure.\r\nChina\u0027s great cause of national reunification can and will be\r\naccomplished.\r\nA few days ago a powerful earthquake shook China\u0027s\r\nprovince of Taiwan. This earthquake caused heavy loss of\r\nlife and property damage for our compatriots in Taiwan.\r\nWe are extremely concerned about this catastrophe and\r\nexpress our sympathy to our compatriots on the island. We\r\nalso express our condolences to the families of the victims\r\nof the earthquake. People on both sides of the strait are\r\nbrothers and sisters in one big family. The disaster that hit\r\nTaiwan and the pains of our compatriots on the island are\r\nshared by the entire Chinese people. We will provide every\r\npossible support and assistance to alleviate the harm caused\r\nby the earthquake.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the international community as a\r\nwhole for their sympathy, condolences and assistance.\r\nThe twenty-first century is dawning. The future of the\r\nworld is bright, and the new century is bound to be a more\r\nsplendid one than this. The Chinese people stand ready to\r\nwork with the people of other countries for the\r\nestablishment of a just and rational new international order,\r\nfor peace and development in the new century, and for the\r\noverall progress of human society.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Italy, His Excellency Mr. Lamberto Dini.\r\nMr. Dini (Italy): I congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly; it is a sure\r\nguarantee of success for the fifty-fourth session. I also wish\r\nto thank your predecessor, Didier Opertti, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Uruguay, for his exemplary management of the\r\nAssembly\u0027s work during the past year.\r\nOn the many issues facing the General Assembly in\r\nthe year to come, Italy shares and supports the statement\r\nmade yesterday by the Foreign Minister of Finland\r\nspeaking on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe last few years of this century have disproved the\r\nnotion that people and human freedoms take second place\r\nto State sovereignty. In Kosovo and East Timor a\r\ncoalition of States resorted to the use of force, but not for\r\nself-seeking national interests, not to defend their borders,\r\nnot to impose new hegemonies.\r\nThe end of the nuclear nightmare has coincided with\r\na rampant proliferation of local conflicts, terrorist acts and\r\ntraumatic economic and financial crises. Can the end of\r\ncommunism have given peace to former cold-war enemies\r\nand conflict to the rest of the world? The cold war\r\nbrought a precarious, imperfect peace. Was that preferable\r\nto the tragic series of conflicts that have embroiled\r\nhumanity over the past 10 years? The division of Europe\r\nhelped neutralize tensions throughout the planet. Does this\r\nmean that nuclear weapons brought about a period of\r\nunprecedented stability, and — as some have suggested,\r\nparadoxically — that we should award the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize to the bomb? The breakdown of the former\r\ninternational order has created a plethora of new States.\r\nDoes this mean that dividing the world in two was the\r\nonly way to grant common citizenship to peoples and\r\nreligious groups that have never learned the art of\r\npeaceful coexistence? The international community now\r\ntakes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few\r\nyears ago would have left us indifferent, and yet we are\r\nstill influenced by military assessments, strategic interests,\r\nregional solidarity, public opinion and the magnitude of\r\nany human rights violations. How can we act according\r\nto more precise rules, based primarily on the duty of\r\nStates to protect the rights of individuals?\r\nThe crises that have broken out in recent years have\r\nraised agonizing dilemmas and difficult questions that\r\ndemand answers. It would be wrong to use the\r\nimperfections of the international system as an excuse for\r\ninaction. But it would also be wrong to ignore the new\r\ndemands for certainty and the rule of law: the greatest\r\nchallenge is how to relate authority to law and lay down\r\ncodes of conduct and political discipline that reconcile\r\npower with legitimacy.\r\nAllow me to articulate a set of principles that could\r\nguide our action in the new century. First, we should\r\nenhance crisis prevention rather than conflict suppression.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has rightly observed that\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nwe must eradicate the cultural and economic causes of\r\nconflicts and that a culture of conflict prevention must\r\nprevail over the culture of conflict suppression. We know\r\nwhat these causes of conflict are: the huge gap between the\r\nliving standards and incomes of different classes and\r\nnations; the exponential increase in mass migration from\r\npoor to rich countries; cultural difference and the conflicts\r\nand fanaticism it triggers; criminal acts for the sake of\r\nglorifying or even creating a nation. These are the four\r\nhorsemen of the contemporary Apocalypse.\r\nSecondly, we should use force only as a last resort.\r\nArms should be used to stop criminal behaviour only when\r\neconomic and political instruments are inapplicable or have\r\nfailed. Ten years ago, these same instruments brought down\r\ntotalitarian communism, which was a more formidable\r\nenemy than today\u0027s tyrants. In the Balkans and in East\r\nTimor, peacekeeping operations were launched to address\r\nserious, massive and systematic violations of human rights.\r\nThe decisions to intervene were made after repeated\r\ndemands that the culprits end a state of illegality; after an\r\nexhaustive and fruitless search for a diplomatic solution;\r\nand by a group of States rather than by a single Power.\r\nWe are living in an age of unfinished wars. In Iraq as\r\nin Serbia, authoritarian rulers have been seriously\r\nweakened, but they are still in power. How and how much\r\ncan sanctions be used to replace or complement the use of\r\nforce? Perhaps we need clearer international strategies and\r\nrules that pay heed to the most vulnerable members of\r\nsociety, to the political opposition and to the risk of\r\nstrengthening despots through sanctions. Our focus should\r\nbe more on incentives than on sanctions.\r\nThirdly, we need to define rules. No one knows the\r\nsize or shape of the next challenge. But our response must\r\nbe dictated by respect for universal principles rather than by\r\na balance of power. We must beware of conjuring up the\r\nspectre of international law as the law of the strongest. We\r\nmust beware of making some countries more equal than\r\nothers. To do so would run counter to our best political and\r\ncultural traditions, in which the law is meant to protect the\r\nweak.\r\nThe Western world and the Euro-Atlantic institutions\r\nare no threat to anyone\u0027s integrity, prosperity and freedom.\r\nBut we must perfect the instruments that uphold the\r\ninternational rule of law. We must spell out the duties of\r\nStates. We must create a fully fledged corpus of case law\r\non universal human rights. We must work out rules and\r\nprocedures that will justify the erosion of sovereignty in the\r\nname of global responsibility. This is why every country\r\nmust make it a priority to ratify the international\r\ninstruments for safeguarding human rights. I am thinking\r\nin particular of the International Criminal Court, which\r\nwas instituted in Rome in June of last year. These\r\ninstruments should be reflected in our national legislation\r\nand practice. Finally, we should encourage the\r\ninvolvement of our own institutions. It is in this spirit that\r\nwe have invited the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, to address the\r\nItalian Parliament.\r\nUntil human rights are firmly institutionalized,\r\ndoubts will remain over the relationship between\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness. The gradual construction of\r\nuniversal citizenship is a learning process to which we all\r\nshould contribute. Otherwise we shall be racing towards\r\nfragmentation, seeking forms of independence that are not\r\neconomically viable and that are vulnerable to others\u0027\r\ndesire for hegemony.\r\nFourthly, we must learn to appreciate the judgement\r\nof others. I would like to quote, in this respect, one of the\r\nfounding fathers of American democracy, James Madison.\r\nHe said:\r\n“An attention to the judgement of other nations\r\nis important to every government for two reasons.\r\nThe first one is that, independently of the merits of\r\nany particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on\r\nvarious accounts, that it should appear to other\r\nnations as the offspring of a wise and honourable\r\npolicy. The second is that, in doubtful cases,\r\nparticularly where the national councils may be\r\nwarped by some strong passion or momentary\r\ninterests, the presumed or known opinion of the\r\nimpartial world may be the best guides that can be\r\nfollowed.”\r\nToday\u0027s world has acquired a new sensitivity. It will\r\nno longer tolerate the oppression of the weak. This\r\nimplies a rethinking of the principles of national\r\nsovereignty and non-interference that have governed the\r\ncommunity of nations for over three centuries, beginning\r\nin Europe. But we must avoid double standards, applying\r\none yardstick to friendly countries and another to those\r\nthat are not. This is what makes the ultimate sanction of\r\nthe United Nations so indispensable, since an international\r\nlegal standard cannot — except in exceptional temporary\r\nsituations — be the prerogative of any single group of\r\nStates.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nWhen we defend the rights of others, we cannot\r\npretend that the lives of our own people are not also at risk.\r\nBy the same token, it would be inconsistent not to place the\r\nsame value on other human lives as we do on our own.\r\nEvery culture and tradition must be involved in the\r\ndefence of liberties and freedom. We cannot ignore the\r\nregional dimension of human rights, whose inviolable\r\nuniversal character can be enriched by the varieties of\r\nhistoric experiences. But stalemates and the paralysis of\r\nintersecting vetoes must be avoided by anchoring even the\r\nstrongest States to a system of rules and principles,\r\nbalancing their power against the effectiveness and strength\r\nof the international institutions.\r\nFifthly, we should strengthen the institutions. The\r\naftermath of the cold war has proved that large political and\r\neconomic groupings can more easily guarantee ethnic\r\ncoexistence, religious tolerance and economic advancement.\r\nThis should be kept in mind whenever pressure builds to\r\nrelease the genie of self-determination from the bottle of\r\nState sovereignty.\r\nOnly the great institutions, whether regional — such\r\nas the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance — or\r\nuniversal — such as the United Nations — can close the\r\ngap between democratic codification of laws and their\r\neffective enforcement. Unless we have a strong institutional\r\nnetwork, every peacekeeping operation could end up\r\nlooking as if we were taking the law into our own hands.\r\nEveryone would feel as if he should look out only for his\r\nown security, leading to a proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Therefore, let us resume the disarmament talks,\r\nas President Clinton proposed in his statement yesterday,\r\nand place our common security on more solid foundations.\r\nThere is one lesson to be learned from these years of\r\nturmoil: actions to prevent and repress the most serious\r\nviolations of human rights may take precedence over\r\nrespect for national sovereignty. No Government can hide\r\nbehind the shield of its own borders. Legitimacy demands\r\nthe redefinition of relations between States and the\r\ninternational community. It demands the reformulation of\r\nthe principle of non-interference, which has sometimes\r\nallowed States to neglect their duties towards their citizens.\r\nAlthough the United Nations is an organization of States,\r\nthe rights and the ideals it protects are those of individuals.\r\nI have listed some rules that will help redefine\r\ncoexistence among peoples through the work of the United\r\nNations. We live in a world in which threats against one\r\ngroup immediately affect every other group and impel them\r\nto take responsibility, a world in which the concept of\r\nnon-interference can no longer be invoked to obstruct\r\naction in the face of serious violations of fundamental\r\nrights. We must ask ourselves how to address all these\r\nchanges, for the sake of closer and more equitable\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nOf course, States will continue to have different\r\nperceptions of national interests, and there will be a\r\ncontinued need to reconcile them peacefully. But for the\r\nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the new century,\r\nour codes of conduct must be placed within a more solid\r\ninstitutional framework. The United Nations Security\r\nCouncil should be made more representative and\r\ndemocratic in composition, in line with proposals of a\r\nnumber of Member States. All the citizens of the world\r\nshould be able to identify themselves with the United\r\nNations and feel a part of its decision-making and law-\r\nmaking processes; this for the sake of universal\r\nsovereignty, which is not the prerogative of a few, but the\r\nright of all.\r\nThe cold war represented an international order\r\ndominated by two super-Powers and held in check by\r\nnuclear weapons. Today’s world is economically more\r\nunited, but politically more divided. The watchword of\r\nthe economy is deregulation. But politics requires rules if\r\nwe do not want anarchy to prevail. Unlike the market, in\r\npolitics no invisible hand can generate peace and\r\nprosperity. What we need is a visible hand that enacts\r\nrules and regulations, and obliges States to respect them,\r\nboth beyond their borders and in the treatment of their\r\ncitizens. Let us make the United Nations the visible hand\r\nof peace and prosperity. This may be the greatest\r\nchallenge awaiting us. We must face it together, here in\r\nthis forum, and place it at the centre of the upcoming\r\ndebate on the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe President: Before I give the floor to the next\r\nspeaker, I should like to remind representatives that, in\r\naccordance with the decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at its third plenary meeting, on 17 September\r\n1999, the list of speakers will be closed today at 6 p.m.\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign and Political\r\nAffairs of San Marino, His Excellency Mr. Gabriele Gatti.\r\nMr. Gatti (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Mr. President, on behalf\r\nof the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I wish\r\nto congratulate you on your election to the presidency of\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You\r\nrepresent a geographical region, the African continent,\r\nwhich can significantly contribute to identifying the major\r\ncauses of world problems and help to evaluate their effects.\r\nYou can lead this Organization towards desirable and\r\nconcrete results.\r\nA particular acknowledgment goes to President Didier\r\nOpertti. San Marino had the opportunity and privilege to\r\nwork in close cooperation with him and to ascertain his\r\nundeniable and extraordinary skills and the remarkable\r\naccomplishments reached during his mandate.\r\nFinally, I would like to congratulate the three new\r\nStates which have recently joined the big family of the\r\nUnited Nations. I am deeply convinced that countries never\r\ninvolved in wars possess an inestimable richness and can\r\ntransmit to the whole world their history of peace and\r\ntolerance, helping us reach the goals set forth in the\r\npreambular paragraphs of the Charter.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino believes that the United\r\nNations is, and must remain, the forum for international\r\nnegotiations best suited to the nations’ expectations. We\r\nreiterate its central role in the prevention and management\r\nof international crises, particularly in the field of peace and\r\nsecurity, through the necessary updating process of its main\r\noperative organs, and primarily the Security Council, which\r\nshould never be delegitimized.\r\nThe Council’s reform, in the context of a larger reform\r\nof the United Nations system, is a fundamental step in the\r\nconstruction of the new international structure. The reform\r\noriginated from the need to update the composition and the\r\nmodus operandi of the most important United Nations\r\norgan to operate in a deeply changed international\r\nenvironment.\r\nWe are particularly thankful to the Secretary-General\r\nfor courageously proposing, and partly already\r\naccomplishing, a complete, wide-ranging programme of\r\nreforms to strengthen the United Nations. This programme\r\nwill progress because only an Organization in constant\r\nevolution will be able to prevent, in some cases, and to\r\ntackle, in others, the challenges of the next millennium.\r\nSan Marino feels internationally responsible and it\r\nfeels the need to mobilize all its strength to find solutions\r\nof solidarity to the serious problem of the external debt of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nFaced with 3 billion people who still live with less\r\nthan $2 a day, faced with 130 million children without\r\naccess to education and 1.5 billion people without\r\ndrinking water, we must support action aimed at creating\r\nsustainable development and healthy economic policies.\r\nThe imbalance between rich and poor countries must not\r\nbecome irreversible, with tragic consequences for all\r\nhumankind.\r\nSan Marino shares and supports the series of\r\nprogrammes and plans announced and applied by creditor\r\ncountries and by the major world financial institutions to\r\ntackle this serious emergency. Programmes and plans\r\nhave so far shown themselves to be insufficient to tackle\r\nthe problem of debt in a decisive way.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations will intensify the\r\ndebate aimed at an equitable and durable solution to the\r\nproblem. In particular, we hope that the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council will\r\nrepresent the best laboratory of ideas for its definition.\r\nSan Marino shares the ethical approach to the situation\r\nthrough solidarity and development. We believe this will\r\ngive more hope to the people affected by this heavy\r\nburden.\r\nIn the past year the Republic of San Marino was one\r\nof the first countries to ratify the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, convinced that such an\r\ninstitution is indispensable for the future world order. In\r\ninternational society, it represents not only a political\r\nadvance, but moral progress, too.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino has recently established\r\na permanent court of arbitration, trusting it will become\r\na trustworthy and impartial international instrument for\r\nthe resolution of national and international disputes. We\r\nare convinced that such an instrument will be duly\r\nevaluated by all Member States of the United Nations and\r\nthat they will shortly be able to subscribe to a proper\r\nconvention. We further believe that this initiative could\r\nrepresent a significant contribution by our country to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAt the outset of the third millennium, we still find\r\ndisconcerting the coexistence of a large, consolidated\r\ncorpus of humanitarian laws and human rights and the\r\nspread of atrocities beyond all limits, affecting almost\r\nexclusively civil populations, mainly women and children.\r\nThe international community can rightly state that it\r\nhas reached goals in the field of humanitarian law and\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nhuman rights that were unimaginable 50 years ago.\r\nHowever, these considerable goals have been reached only\r\nwith the simultaneous application of established rules. In\r\nthis regard, we appreciate the tireless work of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children and\r\nArmed Conflict, aimed at filling the deep gap between\r\nlegality and accepted practice, and at underlining the\r\nabsolute need in the community of States for the full\r\napplication of and respect for, international law. San\r\nMarino has great expectations of the future World Summit\r\nfor Children.\r\nIn every country and in every culture there are\r\nmessages of peace which are often forgotten, neglected or\r\nignored. It is the responsibility of the United Nations, its\r\nspecialized agencies, and all of us to rehabilitate those\r\nmessages through the awakening of our conscience and the\r\napplication of a universal culture of peace. This will happen\r\nif we are able to courageously identify and defeat the seeds\r\nof violence.\r\nTherefore, we have to decide now what culture we\r\nwant to defend: a culture where violence is considered an\r\ninevitable evil from which we can only protect ourselves,\r\nor a culture where violence can and must be eradicated.\r\nThe preamble to the Constitution of the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), which includes the words,\r\n“since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in\r\nthe minds of men that the defences of peace\r\nmust be constructed”,\r\nremains today, in our opinion, the right perspective, because\r\npeace-building through dialogue, education and acceptance\r\nof differences is the best guarantee for the survival of\r\nhumanity.\r\nWe all know that there are 45 armed conflicts going\r\non at this very moment all over the world. Sadly, the\r\nspilling of stains of hate and violence constantly destroys\r\nthe hope that humanity will soon prepare to use the so-\r\ncalled “peace dividend”, resulting from the end of the\r\nbalance of terror between the super-Powers, for positive\r\ngoals.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino deeply appreciates the\r\nrecent Security Council resolution expeditiously\r\nestablishing a multinational peace force to change the\r\nsituation in the East Timor crisis. What the United\r\nNations is starting is a risky mission, but it will contribute\r\nto increasing the role and dignity of the United Nations,\r\nunderlining its force as an impartial and neutral institution\r\ndeploying itself as a bulwark against prevarication to\r\ndefend the life and the dignity of humankind.\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that the Government of\r\nSan Marino acknowledges the renewed impetus and\r\nmomentum of the Arab-Israeli peace process negotiations.\r\nSan Marino regards with equal satisfaction the present\r\nsearch for political solutions at the end of the Balkans\r\nconflict, activating a channel of concrete solidarity for the\r\npopulation of Kosovo.\r\nThe people of San Marino sadly regret to see that\r\nthe important and topical question of the death penalty\r\nhas not been included in the General Assembly’s agenda.\r\nSan Marino intends to continue to voice its protest against\r\ncapital punishment, firmly convinced that the abhorrent\r\ninstrument of death consciously and legally inflicted by\r\none human being on another can be considered neither a\r\nvalid and effective answer to defend society nor a\r\ndeterrent against the spreading of criminality.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of San Marino, I wish\r\nto acknowledge once more the focal role of the United\r\nNations with respect to the major challenges at the end of\r\nthis millennium and the momentum that the greatest\r\ninternational Organization can provide for a new century,\r\nin which the supremacy of a culture of peace over a\r\nculture of war, of a culture of life over a culture of death,\r\nof the full realization of human dignity over its systematic\r\nviolation, will prevail.\r\nIt is in this spirit that I wish good work to you, Sir,\r\nand to all the members of the Assembly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
