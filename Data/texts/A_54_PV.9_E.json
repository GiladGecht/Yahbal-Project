(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of the\r\nRepublic of Djibouti\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Djibouti.\r\nMr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of the Republic of\r\nDjibouti, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of Djibouti, His Excellency Mr. Ismail Omar\r\nGuelleh, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Guelleh (spoke in French): On the occasion\r\nof this historic final session of the General Assembly of the\r\ncurrent millennium, which is my first, as I took office in\r\nMay this year, I extend, on behalf of the people of Djibouti,\r\nour sincere best wishes to all the members of the Assembly.\r\nI should also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at this fifty-\r\nfourth session. Your long and extensive experience with the\r\nUnited Nations, beginning as the representative of the\r\nSouth-West Africa People\u0027s Organization (SWAPO) before\r\nyour country\u0027s independence and continuing as its\r\nPermanent Observer, has afforded you a deep insight into\r\nthe internal workings of the Assembly, and the challenges\r\nit now faces. We are convinced that, thanks to your ample\r\nskills and commitment, this session of the Assembly will\r\nbring a remarkable period to a close on a very positive\r\nnote.\r\nWe also wish to express our gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for the\r\nexemplary manner in which he conducted the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The fact that the Assembly was able\r\nto accomplish so much at its fifty-third session was in\r\ngreat measure due to his dedication, skill and intelligent\r\nmanagement.\r\nWe must also acknowledge our great admiration for\r\nthe tireless efforts of the Secretary-General in continuing\r\nhis exemplary work under difficult and trying\r\ncircumstances. On too many fronts the Organization has\r\nbeen facing challenges which jeopardize its proper\r\nfunctioning, whether dealing with issues of peace and\r\nconflict, development, or addressing the severe poverty\r\nfaced by many in the world community. Despite a sharp\r\nreduction in the inflow of funds at a time of escalating\r\ndemands on the Organization, the Secretary-General has\r\nsucceeded in maintaining a high degree of effectiveness\r\nthrough intelligent rationalization and restructuring. The\r\nOrganization is therefore continuing to play an important\r\nrole in world affairs, which is in no small measure\r\nattributable to the enlightened leadership of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nAs this millennium draws to a close, we find\r\nourselves in a post-cold-war era of globalism. The\r\ndoctrine that the general pursuit of economic and financial\r\nprosperity will necessarily lead to open markets, greater\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\ninternational movement of resources, capital and labour is\r\ndeeply entrenched. As we progress, it is claimed, this global\r\nsystem will produce freer societies and expanding middle\r\nclasses, which, in turn, will exert pressure for political\r\nfreedoms. In the end, it is also claimed, we can all expect\r\nthe spread of peace as countries become more\r\ninterdependent and economically integrated, for free\r\nsocieties do not go to war, at least with each other.\r\nThis model calls for the ascendancy of a more\r\nefficient private sector and a reduced role for government.\r\nFor developing countries, the pursuit of maximum\r\neconomic flexibility has been accompanied by a massive\r\nreorganization of legal, social, financial, economic, political\r\nand institutional structures — or, as it is known, structural\r\nadjustment. The cost of these changes has been\r\nconsiderable, not only in financial terms, but also in human\r\nand social terms as well. As the social safety net in many\r\ncountries consists of government jobs and services,\r\ndownsizing government has meant considerable suffering,\r\nand often with a political price to be paid.\r\nThanks to the spread of technology, particularly in the\r\ncommunications sector, it is now possible for companies\r\nand organizations to operate on a global scale and to enter\r\nvirtually any local market of their choosing. Consequently,\r\neconomic domination has shifted to the large, transnational\r\ncorporations and financial conglomerates, which are\r\nincreasingly the prime movers in most economic systems.\r\nPredictably, the poor and unprepared are increasingly\r\nisolated and marginalized. It is therefore not surprising that\r\nthere is a mounting and widespread backlash against the\r\ndestructive effects of this global juggernaut.\r\nThe old market economy system following the Second\r\nWorld War — the Marshall Plan era — survived because\r\nthere were few persistent losers. Everyone got something\r\nfrom the system and could claim ownership. We cannot say\r\nthat today, for the roster of losers is mounting ominously.\r\nThis is a distressing omen for the new millennium, made all\r\nthe more tragic and infuriating because of the abundance of\r\npossible remedies. We can make the system work\r\neffectively and beneficially if the will is there. But at\r\npresent the international community lacks determination and\r\na sense of compassion. That does not bode well for\r\nmankind.\r\nGlobalization and the rapid expansion and integration\r\nof the international economy have undoubtedly brought\r\nimmense benefits to many countries and positive changes\r\nin the living conditions of many individuals. However,\r\nmany countries and their populations, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping world, are increasingly facing marginalization\r\nand hopelessness because they are not able to cope with\r\nthe rapid pace of integration. The least developed\r\ncountries in particular require special attention so that\r\nthey do not slip further into the abyss of poverty and\r\ndisintegration.\r\nClearly, the Horn of Africa has had far more than its\r\nshare of wars, natural disasters, collapsing States,\r\neconomic decline and wasted national and human\r\npotential. For Djibouti, survival alone has consistently\r\npresented an enormous challenge. However, our nation\r\ntoday is stronger and more unified than ever before. We\r\nowe this to the wisdom, perseverance and foresight of our\r\nfirst President and father of the nation, my mentor, The\r\nHonourable Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who voluntarily\r\nretired a few months ago — a praiseworthy decision. He\r\nforged a nation and gave it purpose and strength. His\r\nenlightened leadership enabled us to remain at peace,\r\nwhile sensitive to our region\u0027s difficulties and needs. I am\r\nproud to follow in the footsteps of this great soul, and I\r\nam determined to safeguard his legacy and our democratic\r\ntraditions and institutions.\r\nDjibouti will continue to work for good governance,\r\ndemocracy and independence, with respect for human\r\nrights. We will continue, true to our cultural heritage, to\r\ngive sanctuary to people displaced by conflicts in our\r\nregion, despite the severe strain this puts on our meagre\r\nresources.\r\nAfrica has many hopeful spots, but there remain a\r\nnumber of disturbing conflicts involving nations, countless\r\nrebel and separatist movements and factions. Democratic\r\nelections took place a few months ago in two major\r\nStates of sub-Saharan Africa — Nigeria and South\r\nAfrica — and in smaller ones, such as Djibouti, while in\r\nmost of the major conflicts ravaging the continent\r\nceasefires or peace processes are under way.\r\nIn looking over these developments, what can we\r\nreasonably expect? What must we strive to bring about?\r\nOur first priority must be to bring conflict and destruction\r\nto an end. That is why ceasefires, the withdrawal of\r\ncombatants, disarmament, the settlement of conflicts, and\r\nthe resettlement of displaced persons are important\r\npriorities for Africa.\r\nAs conflicts rage in the heart of the continent, a\r\ndangerous new tendency has begun to appear. Conflicts\r\nare no longer localized or fought between two clear\r\nadversaries, but attract a growing legion of participants\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nwith divergent agendas. It is depressing to witness the\r\nmassive loss of life, the wanton destruction and the virtual\r\ncollapse of societies.\r\nWe are therefore relieved that the brutal conflict in\r\nSierra Leone is at last resolved. Besides Somalia, perhaps\r\nthe most worrying conflict now is Angola, where again\r\noutside actors appear to be playing significant roles.\r\nWe therefore naturally support the call of the\r\nSecretary-General, who in his report on conflict in Africa\r\ncalled for a reversal of the international community\u0027s great\r\nreluctance in recent years to assume the political and\r\nfinancial responsibilities associated with deploying\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nWe must also do everything we can to augment the\r\nUnited Nations capacity in humanitarian assistance, as well\r\nas in post-conflict peace-building.\r\nNone of this, though, should absolve Africa of the\r\nneed to come together to strengthen its own crisis response\r\nand peacekeeping capability, through the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations.\r\nLast year, in his address to this Assembly, my\r\npredecessor noted the sudden and surprising outbreak of\r\nmassive hostilities between our neighbours, Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea. This has been the cause of much anguish,\r\napprehension and instability in the Horn of Africa. The loss\r\nof life on both sides is among the greatest ever witnessed\r\nbetween African States. Persistent efforts by the OAU and\r\nvarious countries, including Djibouti, have proved to be in\r\nvain. Ethiopia is presently seeking further clarification on\r\nthe “technical arrangements” proposed by the OAU, and we\r\nhope that the ongoing efforts will produce the desired\r\nbreakthrough. If a ceasefire does not take effect and\r\nagreement is not reached, the destruction and further loss of\r\nlife will once again be deplorable. Years will be needed to\r\nrepair the damage done to ethnic tolerance and trust in the\r\nHorn of Africa. We therefore support the OAU, which is\r\ndemonstrating its tenacity and foresight in trying to bring\r\nabout a lasting resolution of this crisis.\r\nClearly, Eritrea needs to be a good neighbour to all its\r\nneighbours. Djibouti is now facing a relentless threat of\r\ndestabilization through incursions and landmines, as well as\r\nthe training and arming of disaffected elements. Rather than\r\nbeing confined to Ethiopia, hostilities have spread to\r\npractically every country in the Horn. We sincerely believe\r\nthat Eritrea would gain more as an equal partner in the\r\ncollective regional efforts to fashion a comprehensive\r\npeace, augment development and address the challenges\r\nof environmental degradation, rather than pursuing a\r\npolicy of confrontation and senseless and reckless\r\ndestabilization.\r\nThe renewed dialogue between the Palestinians and\r\nthe new Israeli leader appears to offer a promising\r\nopportunity for charting a new course in the Middle East.\r\nThe most urgent need is to restore confidence — a task\r\nthat will involve winning over the hearts and minds of\r\nPalestinians jaded by the cynicism of successive Israeli\r\nGovernments. The timely implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the recent agreement should help build the\r\nnecessary confidence by making the parties see reason.\r\nAdvantage must be taken of the current momentum,\r\ndespite the efforts of hostile factions.\r\nNow that a time-table has been set for the\r\nconsideration of final-status issues such as borders,\r\nsettlements, the status of Jerusalem, refugees, water and\r\nstatehood for Palestine, the outcome will depend on the\r\nwill and commitment of both sides. The road should also\r\nbe cleared for a settlement of the Golan Heights question\r\nand for the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\r\nThe crippling sanctions imposed on Iraq almost a\r\ndecade ago have taken a heavy toll on the population,\r\nparticularly on the elderly, women and children. We urge\r\nthe international community to undertake a realistic\r\nreview of these sanctions with a view to lifting them\r\naltogether.\r\nThe Arab world and the world as a whole have\r\nrecently lost several remarkable and pragmatic leaders.\r\nKing Hussein of Jordan, the Amir of Bahrain and King\r\nHassan II of Morocco are no longer with us. Although we\r\nall feel a sense of loss at their premature demise, we have\r\nevery confidence their legacies will live on.\r\nMr. President, I beg your indulgence, as I would\r\nnow like to speak at length about the tragedy in Somalia.\r\nFor nearly a decade now we have been witnessing the\r\ninexorable disintegration of Somalia. With their country\r\nracked by violence and lacking a government, the Somali\r\npeople are being denied their basic human rights. It is\r\nimperative that every effort be made to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of the millions of Somalis who have been living\r\na precarious existence for a decade now. Housing and\r\nwater are alarmingly scarce. Rampant lawlessness\r\nprevails, the country is at a political impasse, and its\r\nfuture is bleak. If no concrete steps are taken, the result\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nwill be continued misery and despair, as well as the\r\ncontinued destabilization of Somalia\u0027s neighbours.\r\nThis unique situation, I would even say this tragedy,\r\nought to be given priority — the kind of serious\r\nconsideration that is given to other tragedies. We strongly\r\nbelieve that international and regional stability depend to a\r\nlarge extent on the domestic stability of all of the States\r\nMembers of this Organization.\r\nIt is tragic indeed that the international community is\r\nunwilling to acknowledge this reality, simply because, it\r\nseems, it has no vital national interests at stake there. So\r\nthe warlords are left to fight it out until a victor emerges\r\nand a degree of order is restored. Political will on the part\r\nof the international community can bring peace to Somalia,\r\ntoo.\r\nBecause of pervasive indifference and a lack of\r\nresolve, vision and action on our part, Somalia is\r\ncrumbling. It is no longer a politically viable entity. Indeed,\r\nthe continued anarchy in that country is indicative of the\r\nfailure of global governance to serve poor countries in the\r\ndeveloping world. The Somali people know that only too\r\nwell. A decade of violence, hunger, disease and uncertainty\r\nhas given rise to unparalleled levels of despair. All Somalis,\r\nit is safe to say, are living below the poverty line, and the\r\ndevastating civil war shows no signs of abating in most\r\nparts of the country. Somalia could easily become a magnet\r\nfor criminal elements, drug traffickers and terrorists as well\r\nas a dumping ground of dangerous toxic wastes.\r\nOverfishing by foreigners of Somalia\u0027s unprotected waters\r\nis also a cause of great concern to us.\r\nThe latest comprehensive report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Somalia accurately notes that the country has\r\ndegenerated into a black hole of anarchy, with no national\r\ngovernment or attributes of statehood. The principal victims\r\nof this senseless conflict are an entire generation of Somali\r\nchildren, who are being denied access to education.\r\nThe United Nations intervened in Somalia in 1992\r\nwith all the right intentions: to restore peace, stability, and\r\nlaw and order. In this respect, it was entrusted with\r\nassisting the Somali people in rebuilding their economy and\r\ntheir social and political life; restoring their institutional\r\nstructures; achieving national political reconciliation; and\r\nrecreating a Somali state based on democratic governance.\r\nRegrettably, those laudable intentions came to naught\r\nfollowing the termination of the United Nations Operation\r\nin Somalia, due to the lack of cooperation from the Somali\r\nfactions over security issues, and despite the exceptional\r\ncircumstances, in particular the absence of a government\r\nin Somalia.\r\nSince the end of the United Nations operation, two\r\nconferences have given rise to a certain optimism — the\r\nEthiopian-sponsored Sodere conference and the Cairo\r\nconference, sponsored by the Egyptian Government.\r\nHowever, both conferences succeeded only in highlighting\r\nthe divisions among the warlords on the one hand and the\r\ninterested countries on the other.\r\nSeveral countries and organizations have worked\r\ntirelessly to restore some measure of governance in\r\nSomalia. The focus, though, has always remained on\r\nbringing together the feuding warlords in order to assist\r\nthem in reaching an agreement that would end the\r\nstalemate. But seeking a lasting settlement through the\r\nwarlords, as has repeatedly and unambiguously been\r\ndemonstrated throughout the conflict, has proved to be\r\nwishful thinking; uncertainty reigns, and the culture of\r\nimpunity persists. Lately, we have seen the formation of\r\nall sorts of political and military alliances across factional\r\nlines in a bid to pacify the country, but such initiatives\r\nare often greeted with scepticism or even criticism by\r\nother factions and even by certain countries. Clearly, not\r\na single factional leader can claim national support or\r\nacceptance, because Somali civil society has grown\r\ncynical about a political game devoid of sincerity, vision\r\nand substance.\r\nEverybody agrees in recognizing that the warlords\r\ncan offer nothing that would lead us to believe that they\r\nwill ever agree on a lasting settlement, much less the\r\nimplementation of conclusions agreed between them. The\r\npeople are tired of false rhetoric and deception, as they\r\nbecome poorer and their future becomes bleaker every\r\nday. Even beyond Somalia, the warlords pose a potential\r\nthreat. They need to be resisted, for there is the very real\r\nproblem of a “contagion” effect, whereby chronic\r\ninstability in one country in the Horn might prove to be\r\na real threat to its neighbours, if it is not contained or\r\neliminated within a reasonable period of time.\r\nLiberia’s seven-year war, with its child soldiers and\r\nunspeakable atrocities against civilians, helped set a tragic\r\npattern that was repeated in Sierra Leone. Obviously,\r\nalready inundated with weapons, Somalia hardly needs\r\nexternal involvement by way of arms supplies or proxy\r\nconfrontations, but that is precisely what is now taking\r\nplace in that country. For all of us, this situation only\r\nincreases our worry about Somalia’s future.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThe challenge that we now face is therefore of\r\nestablishing an authority to fill the void that is continuously\r\nbeing exploited by the warlords. Convening more\r\nconferences that always yield the same results, as has been\r\nthe case over the last 10 years is not the remedy. If we\r\ncontinue to entertain the notion of holding yet more of the\r\nso-called national reconciliation conferences indefinitely, or\r\ninto the next decade, in search of peace in Somalia, then\r\nwe are, in effect, saying that Somali civil society is\r\ncondemned to an uncertain future, because the international\r\ncommunity is not prepared to protect it from criminal\r\nelements that usurped power. Despite the “legitimacy”\r\nwrongly accorded them by the international community,\r\nthey have never agreed, and will never agree, on anything.\r\nTrying to appease the warlords has never succeeded and\r\nnever will.\r\nThe Somalis, too, have human rights; they have the\r\nsame right as others to be protected from oppressive,\r\nmalicious and power-hungry individuals who continually\r\nand freely move from one capital to another, raising funds\r\nand securing armaments. Although these individuals are\r\nresponsible for the destruction of their country, for the\r\ndeaths of tens of thousands of innocent civilians, countless\r\nnumbers of casualties and for the paralysis that immobilizes\r\nthe country to this day, the international community did not\r\nintervene in Somalia, “to defend humanitarian principles\r\nand to stand up for the values of civilization and justice”,\r\nas one Western leader stated in justifying the Kosovo\r\noperation. The United Nations Operation in Somalia was\r\nalso saddled with ambiguities in its mandate and there was\r\nnever an intention to rid the country of the warlords.\r\nFurthermore, Kosovo represents a clear case of\r\ndetermined and vigorous action to achieve a specific\r\nobjective — to drive the marauding Serb army from\r\nKosovo. Furthermore, the United Nations operation in\r\nKosovo is vested with unprecedented power, because the\r\ncircumstances warrant the exercise of nearly sovereign\r\npowers. It has authority over the territory, the people of\r\nKosovo, the legislative and the executive powers of\r\nKosovo, including the administration of the judiciary\r\nsystem. That mandate is a far cry from that in Somalia; but\r\nthen Somalia is not Kosovo.\r\nWe all agree that the current level of fragmentation\r\ncannot be allowed to continue. Many ideas have been\r\nfloated in the past, but none of these will succeed or even\r\nsurvive as long as the warlords have the luxury of\r\ndetermining the fate of Somalia. Indeed, they continue to\r\nexercise a veto over the restoration of peace and national\r\nauthority. The question remains, for how many more years\r\nwill Somali society have to wait until the warlords accept\r\na power-sharing coalition? Until a final victor emerges?\r\nFor ever?\r\nLiberia was reconstituted through strong international\r\nefforts. Warlords of varying levels of power and support\r\neventually submitted to international pressures and\r\naccepted independent, internationally supervised\r\ndemocratic elections, followed by the implementation of\r\nagreements during a year of transition carried out under\r\nthe leadership of an individual — in fact, a woman — not\r\naffiliated with any of the warlords. The elections were\r\ndescribed as “free and fair”, and Liberians were thus able\r\nto bid farewell at last to a destructive and intractable\r\nconflict. This was indeed an exemplary process in which\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States,\r\nsupported by the United Nations, played a leading role.\r\nSince the outbreak of the Somali crisis some 10\r\nyears ago, the United Nations, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, the League of Arab States, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development and our\r\nsubregional organization, as well as many countries, both\r\nwithin and outside the region, have tried to salvage that\r\nnation from mayhem, anarchy and political paralysis\r\nthrough all kinds of conferences, meetings and contacts\r\nwith and among the warlords. Sadly, however, the\r\nwarlords have repeatedly demonstrated their unwillingness\r\nto heed the international community’s call to put the good\r\nof the country above their individual lust for power and\r\ncontrol.\r\nWe have to ask ourselves, as leaders of the world\r\nassembled here, what should be done about Somalia. The\r\ntime has come, in our view, for the international\r\ncommunity to take a decision to break the long silence on\r\nthis forgotten conflict by supporting bold, decisive\r\nmeasures against the warlords.\r\nThat is why, after deep reflection and after taking\r\ninto account all relevant factors, I felt compelled to set\r\nout before the Assembly today a series of proposals and\r\nphased measures that would be the expression of our\r\noutrage, frustration and impatience with the status quo\r\nperpetuated by the warlords.\r\nThe first phase has to do with the fact that the\r\nwarlords, as I have described with great sorrow, have\r\nfailed on every count during this long, intractable civil\r\nwar. Thus, I am loath to support yet another conference\r\nheld for these men who have completely lost the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nconfidence of their people. It is time Somali civil society —\r\nincluding intellectuals, artists and mothers — assumed\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe Somali people has matured politically during these\r\nyears of suffering and knows what it needs: economic\r\nprosperity and social progress in a context of democracy,\r\nliberty and peace.\r\nIn line with the wishes of the Somali people, Djibouti\r\nis embarking upon measures intended; to enhance and\r\nstrengthen Somali’s confidence in themselves, in each other\r\nand in their common destiny; to make a real contract of\r\ntrust and progress between the actors of economic, social,\r\ncultural and intellectual life; and to implement with\r\ndetermination, serenity and equity the work of\r\nrehabilitation, political, economic and administrative\r\nnormalization and the promotion of the culture of dialogue\r\nbetween the Somali people in order to create a lasting\r\nenvironment of dialogue for the emergence of a new\r\ngeneration of decision makers.\r\nIn order for Djibouti to have confidence in the Somali\r\npeople’s responsibility for its future, Somali citizens must\r\nfinally be given the right to speak out so that they can\r\nrestore the essential values of liberty, truth, justice,\r\nresponsibility and transparency. By working for and basing\r\nthemselves on Somali civil society through the holding of\r\na genuine reconciliation conference, the representatives of\r\nthe Somali people, including the warlords, will be\r\ncommitting themselves to the path of peace and national\r\nreconciliation.\r\nWe seek a Somalia led and governed by the best\r\npeople drawn from all generations, in particular people who\r\ninspire confidence because of their commitment to law,\r\njustice, freedom and peace; those who will govern with a\r\nview to fulfilling a mandate that can be withdrawn at any\r\ntime in accordance with the requirements of the common\r\ngood; those who do not think only of profiting by the\r\nmisfortune of their brethren to gain a scrap of power no\r\nmatter what the cost to the Somali nation. Somalia needs\r\nthose men and women who in spite of everything have\r\nretained their ethical values, the force of their personalities\r\nand their intellectual and spiritual dynamism: free men and\r\nwomen who are ready to offer their fellow Somalis a\r\ncredible way out of their tragedy that will be consistent\r\nwith the cultural heritage and collective memory of the\r\nSomali people.\r\nThe reconciliation conference must give rise to\r\nagreement and commitment by all Somalis to the following\r\nprinciples. First, there must be acceptance of the basic\r\nprinciple that the Somali people is free to exercise its\r\ndemocratic right to select its own regional and national\r\nleaders in accordance with a time-frame of its own\r\nchoosing. Secondly, the warlords must agree to convert\r\ntheir factions into political parties that can compete in\r\nelections if they choose to do so. Thirdly, the warlords\r\nmust agree to the complete and verifiable disarmament of\r\ntheir fighters. Fourthly, the warlords must submit to the\r\nprimacy of law. Fifthly, the warlords must accede to the\r\ninternational community’s request to participate in the\r\nrestoration of normalcy, law and order, and a framework\r\nfor governance. And finally, a national police force must\r\nbe established, one that will represent the entire Somali\r\ncommunity and that can incorporate the various militias,\r\nwhich will have the opportunity to participate in it.\r\nHere I should say that some countries in or outside\r\nof the Horn of Africa, which in one way or another are\r\nfueling the conflict in Somalia, must reconsider their\r\npositions. These countries are pursuing narrow national\r\ninterests by supporting the profusion of warlords in\r\nvarious ways, and they are only prolonging the agony and\r\nprivation of Somali civil society. I call on all actors in the\r\ncivil war to review their priorities with a view to\r\nachieving peace in Somalia. It is time that they controlled\r\nthemselves: high time.\r\nWhen they can agree that the warlords fully support\r\nor accept the parameters of phase one, the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU), the United Nations and the\r\ncountries of the region must work together to help\r\nSomalia in its transition to democracy. As in Guinea-\r\nBissau, the United Nations should establish a post-conflict\r\npeace-building office in Somalia to initiate projects in\r\nsupport of this process, including by coordinating and\r\nmonitoring the holding of legislative and presidential\r\nelections.\r\nI turn now to phase two. If the warlords place\r\ninsurmountable obstacles on the road to peace, the\r\ninternational community will have to shoulder its\r\nresponsibility and demonstrate robustly that it cannot let\r\nthe persecution of Somali civilians continue indefinitely\r\nwithout taking action. The warlords must in that case be\r\nprosecuted for crimes against humanity: for abuse of\r\npower, especially through the unjustified persecution of\r\ncivilians; for flagrant violations of human rights; and for\r\nhaving caused the collapse of the State and the\r\ndestruction of their country. With their unabated violence\r\nand their erratic behaviour, the warlords have stolen the\r\nchildhood from Somalia’s young people; they have\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\ndeprived their nation of hope and of a future; they have\r\ncondemned their people to a precarious existence.\r\nMoreover, harsh and targeted punishment must be\r\nmeted out to warlords who do not agree to the international\r\ncommunity’s demand that peace and a framework for\r\ngovernance be restored in Somalia: they must be confined\r\nto their bleak and battered areas; they must be banned from\r\nfreely traveling abroad to further their sinister designs; all\r\nforeign support and all assistance, whether monetary or\r\nmaterial, must be banned; and all their assets, in all forms\r\nand wherever they are located, must be frozen.\r\nTurning to phase three, if the measures set out in the\r\nfirst two phases cannot achieve the objectives because of\r\nobstruction by the warlords, we would be faced with two\r\ndifficult choices: We could continue to remain indifferent\r\nand to do nothing about the decade-old siege of Somalia; or\r\norganizations to which Somalia belongs, first and foremost\r\nthe Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab\r\nStates, with support from the United Nations and from\r\nother countries, could decide that they were obliged to\r\nresolve the situation by using all necessary means on the\r\nprinciple that no State — or criminal warlord in this\r\ncase — may continue indefinitely to commit flagrant\r\nviolations of human rights and to hold a country hostage\r\nforever.\r\nThose are the critical scenarios we need to discuss,\r\nbecause, however much one might wish to forget Somalia,\r\nit will not just go away. We must do something to remedy\r\nthe situation, and we must do it as quickly as possible.\r\nLet me reiterate that we must put an end to the\r\ncomplacency we have displayed towards the warlords, and\r\nthat Somali civil society must be more closely involved in\r\nany future process.\r\nIt is important to note that the situation is not the same\r\nin all regions of the country; anarchy does not prevail\r\neverywhere. Somalia has many contrasting faces depending\r\non the region. While disorder reigns in areas of the centre\r\nand the South, northern regions such as the self-proclaimed\r\nstates of Somaliland and Puntland are enjoying relative\r\npeace and stability. Those two areas fortunately escaped\r\nmost of the conflict that ravaged the country in the 1990s.\r\nThey have made a great effort to strengthen security and,\r\nwith very little outside assistance, have carried out\r\nadmittedly limited economic reconstruction programmes.\r\nThe international community has thus far been wary of\r\nproviding meaningful assistance, on the pretext that the\r\npolitical and security situation makes it impossible.\r\nAs we meet here today, communities in many towns\r\nand regions are organizing to determine their own future.\r\nThis trend towards decentralization or self-administration\r\nis based on the strong determination of the Somalis not to\r\nsuccumb, but rather to survive. The international\r\ncommunity is duty-bound to provide economic support for\r\nthese regions and communities that have achieved relative\r\npeace, security and the beginnings of development: near-\r\nnormalcy. The international community should reward\r\nthose who are trying to provide their people with basic\r\nservices, including an institutional framework and mine-\r\nclearance efforts.\r\nI am grateful to the Secretary-General, who has\r\nplaced the question of Somalia high on the international\r\nagenda, and to United Nations agencies such as the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food\r\nProgramme and their partners, who have provided food\r\nand care to the Somali people despite the risks for the\r\nsafety of their personnel. But these praiseworthy efforts\r\nseem to be showing some fatigue, even frustration,\r\nbecause of inadequate support from donors, as reflected\r\nin the lukewarm response to the 1999 United Nations\r\nappeal. We urge the international community to continue\r\nto help the Somali people during these times, which are\r\nparticularly difficult due in part to the long drought,\r\nfurther exacerbated by the ongoing civil war.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Djibouti\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of the Republic\r\nof Djibouti, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Echeverría,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Costa Rica.\r\nMr. Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Echeverría, President\r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica, His Excellency\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nMr. Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Echeverría, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rodríguez Echeverría (spoke in Spanish): Let\r\nme congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\r\nof this General Assembly, a truly global parliament where\r\nall mankind is represented and finds expression in its\r\ndiversity and its fundamental unity. Your election and your\r\npersonal qualities honour your country and your region.\r\nI would like to congratulate also the delegations of\r\nKiribati, Tonga and Nauru, and through them their\r\nGovernments and peoples, on their recently becoming\r\nMembers of this Organization. We are convinced that they\r\nwill contribute constructively and positively to the work of\r\nthe United Nations, and that their presence here reaffirms\r\nthe universal and democratic vocation of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are holding this session at a transcendental\r\nmoment in human history. At the threshold of a new\r\ncentury and a new millennium, it is timely for the peoples\r\nof the world to reflect on the future of our countries and of\r\nthe international system. Facing the new millennium, we\r\nmust draw lessons from the era that we are leaving behind,\r\nin which we learned all the good and all the evil that we\r\ncan do. We saw the first man walking on the moon, the end\r\nof apartheid in South Africa and peace agreements signed\r\nin Central America; but we witnessed also the consequences\r\nof the nuclear mushroom cloud and the aberration of the\r\nHolocaust, ethnic conflicts and local wars which in the last\r\n40 years have caused more deaths than the two world wars\r\ntogether. We have seen the bright-lights of democracy and\r\nfreedom, but also the deep shadows of poverty and the\r\nviolation of human rights.\r\nThis has been a century of great contrasts. While in\r\nsome parts of the globe peace is signed, in others war is\r\nnever ending. While thousands of millions live in poverty,\r\na small group lives in opulence. While we celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, in many parts of the world gross violations of\r\nhuman dignity are committed. Yes, this has been a century\r\nof many contrasts. It has given us plenty of reasons to be\r\nproud, but it has also made us ashamed of the cruelty and\r\nhardness of the human heart. For these reasons we should\r\nnever forget the lessons of the twentieth century.\r\nIn the context of these lessons, we, the 188 nations\r\ngathered here — each with its own flag and symbols, each\r\nwith its own political, commercial and strategic interests,\r\neach with its own problems, suffering, visions and\r\ndreams — express our readiness to take up the challenges\r\nof the new century, which must take shape, beginning\r\nnow, as the century of human rights and human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFor these reasons, we have to recognize that the\r\ngreatest failure of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity in recent years has been the persistence of\r\ncruel armed conflicts and civil wars, which cause\r\ncontinued humanitarian crises and prevent the peaceful\r\ndevelopment of nations. The real victims of war are the\r\ndisplaced and refugee children and elderly, the raped\r\nwomen, the youngsters killed, the workers whose\r\nworkplaces are destroyed, the students whose schools are\r\nbombed and the sick who cannot receive treatment. While\r\nwar persists, human rights cannot be respected.\r\nIn this sense, we condemn the atrocities committed\r\nin East Timor against the civilian population, and we join\r\nthe whole world in demanding that its will, democratically\r\nexpressed, be respected. We view with satisfaction the\r\nquick action of the Security Council, which will allow for\r\nthe deployment of an international peacekeeping force in\r\nthat Territory in order to prevent a greater humanitarian\r\ncrisis. In retrospect, this crisis teaches us that the\r\ninternational community must be willing to actively and\r\npromptly support the processes that it initiates.\r\nRegarding the situation in the Middle East, we watch\r\nwith hope the progress in the search for a peaceful and\r\ndefinitive solution on the basis of full compliance with\r\nthe Oslo accords. We acknowledge the tireless efforts of\r\nPresident Barak, of Israel, and President Arafat, of the\r\nPalestinian Authority, and their commitment to peace and\r\nthe future of their peoples.\r\nI would like to express my condolences to the\r\npeople of the Republic of China on Taiwan for the tragic\r\nearthquake that devastated its territory on Monday, 20\r\nSeptember, and the recent after-shock. My most heartfelt\r\nsympathy goes to the families of the victims and the\r\ninjured.\r\nCosta Rica has a firm relationship with the Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan. We admire its shared economic\r\nprogress, its respect for human rights and its democracy,\r\nmuch promoted by President Lee. Our deep commitment\r\nto the cause of peace prompts us to view with concern the\r\ngrowing differences and instability in the region during\r\nthe last year. We fear that these threaten peace and might\r\nunleash a new armaments race. For this reason, we trust\r\nthat the differences will be resolved through constructive\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\ndialogue and negotiation in good faith, with respect for the\r\ninterests of the whole Chinese people.\r\nWe must remember that the United Nations was\r\nestablished with precisely the mandate of eradicating the\r\nscourge of war, and it must again take the lead in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Costa Rica\r\ntherefore supports the efforts to reform the Security\r\nCouncil, which cannot be limited simply to an increase in\r\nthe number of its members, even if this might be useful.\r\nRather, the reform effort must centre on the Council’s\r\nrevitalization.\r\nFifty years ago Costa Rica abolished its army. In line\r\nwith this example, it has advocated disarmament throughout\r\nthe history of the United Nations, in order to build a world\r\nof progress and peace. The abolition of the army allowed\r\nour society to become an example of dialogue, respect and\r\nthe peaceful coexistence of all social groups. Costa Rica\r\nactively promotes demilitarization because it knows its\r\nextraordinary benefits for human development; in this\r\ncontext, we have proposed the creation of a fund for the\r\ndemilitarization of Central America, as well as the\r\nstrengthening of, and full compliance with, the mechanisms\r\nof international law, in order to guarantee international\r\npeace and security and respect for human rights throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nCosta Rica considers that humanitarian crises are in\r\nthemselves threats to international peace and security. When\r\nthey arise, the United Nations and the Security Council\r\nmust not attempt to avoid their responsibility, whatever\r\nreasons are invoked. Nowadays any massive violation of\r\nhuman rights, any humanitarian emergency, requires the\r\ncoordinated action of the international community, through\r\nthis Organization. For there to be justice at the global level,\r\nthe rule of law and full compliance with the principles that\r\ngave birth to the United Nations must prevail.\r\nIn this context, we recall the importance of the prompt\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, and thus\r\ncall on all States that have not yet done so to sign the\r\nStatute with a view to its prompt ratification, and we\r\nreiterate the need to accelerate the negotiations on its rules\r\nof procedure. Costa Rica hopes to receive promptly the\r\nfinal text in order to proceed to its ratification.\r\nFurthermore, we must recognize that conflicts and\r\ncrises are multifaceted and that they present a series of\r\npolitical, military and economic problems. In this context,\r\naction undertaken by the United Nations must be designed\r\nnot only to re-establish peace in military terms but also to\r\nre-establish peace in terms of social justice, democracy\r\nand development. The actions taken by this Organization\r\nshould not be centred only on the Security Council but\r\nmust actively include the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme as participants in the peace-\r\nbuilding process.\r\nMy people’s manifest desire is for the new century\r\nto be truly the century of human rights and human\r\ndevelopment. I would like to express to the international\r\ncommunity the desire of a people that, since the\r\nnineteenth century, has been building the foundation of a\r\nfar-sighted society by balancing in a single equation\r\nrespect for human rights, freedom, peace, active tolerance,\r\nfraternity, democracy and solidarity.\r\nThe end of the cold war, the knowledge-based\r\neconomy, awareness of gender issues, an understanding of\r\nthe rights of the persons with disabilities and of\r\nminorities, respect for the rights of the future generations\r\nand for environmental protection, and the processes of\r\nglobalization have all begun to delineate a new human\r\norder: a twenty-first century with a more human mankind.\r\nIn this new context, which is just now showing its initial\r\ncharacteristics, the human development agenda and the\r\nhuman rights agenda must coincide and complement each\r\nother. The twenty-first century is taking shape as that in\r\nwhich individuals and peoples will demand the right to\r\nhuman development, which is nothing more than the\r\nappropriate implementation and effectiveness of the\r\ninstitutions of freedom: human rights, the rule of law,\r\npluralism, competition, solidarity and harmony with\r\nnature.\r\nIt is at once a right and a duty to take part, actively,\r\ncreatively and jointly, in the creation of such\r\ndevelopment, because the twenty-first century is called\r\nupon to be the century of high-intensity citizenship. Male\r\nand female citizens are, together with the State and the\r\ninternational community, the creators of their own\r\nopportunities and the builders of their own development.\r\nPassivity is a thing of the past.\r\nWe in Costa Rica who are part of this change\r\ngreatly value the foresight and sense of responsibility of\r\nour forefathers, which have made of our small motherland\r\nthe second-ranking country in Latin America in terms of\r\nhuman development and the oldest and most stable\r\ndemocracy in the region. Even as early as the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, Costa Ricans enjoyed the continent’s\r\nhighest levels of education and health, thanks to the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\ncountry’s far-sighted devotion to education, the rule of law,\r\ndemocracy, social solidarity and international trade. Since\r\nthe early days of our independent and republican life,\r\nsolidarity and human rights, in their fullness, have been a\r\nway of life for us Costa Ricans. Not in vain was our first\r\nConstitution called the “Covenant of Harmony”. Thus, last\r\nyear when hurricane Mitch devastated Central America, in\r\nthe midst of the pain over the loss of Costa Rican lives and\r\nthe serious economic damage, we also took on the suffering\r\nof our Central American brothers and sisters. We were side\r\nby side with them, sharing with them our food, medicine\r\nand territory.\r\nFaithful to its humanitarian tradition, Costa Rica\r\nimplemented the most generous immigration policy put\r\nforward by any nation in recent years, giving hundreds of\r\nthousands of illegal immigrants from the region —\r\namounting to more than 10 per cent of our population —\r\nthe opportunity to normalize their situation with a minimum\r\nof requirements, as well as the opportunity to enjoy full\r\nequality with our nationals in access to our social welfare\r\ninstitutions. We hope that other countries that are sought\r\nout by immigrants because of war, poverty, natural\r\ncatastrophes and ethnic conflicts will follow this example.\r\nOur country is making great efforts to look after these\r\nhundreds of thousands of immigrants; therefore, we reiterate\r\nour need to be helped so that we can strengthen the health,\r\neducation and basic-services systems that we use in order\r\nto meet their needs.\r\nAt this end of the century, it has been my task to\r\npromote vital transformations for the future of our small\r\nnation. We are protecting human beings even before they\r\nare born. We are fighting against child labour and the\r\nsexual exploitation of minors. We are opening havens for\r\nour adolescent mothers, and we are fighting the aggression\r\nsuffered by women in many homes the world over. We are\r\nstrengthening the family, providing it with more and better\r\nopportunities. We are working in favour of the rights of\r\nelder adults and those of workers, in order to deepen our\r\nsocial achievements of the 1940s and to guarantee a\r\nretirement pension in old age as a universal human right.\r\nCosta Rica is today acknowledged to be the healthiest\r\nsociety in Latin America, with high levels of computer\r\nliteracy. It is the oldest democracy on the continent and a\r\nleader in the conservation and protection of the\r\nenvironment. Its human development levels are comparable\r\nto those of developed countries. Nevertheless, we face\r\nserious problems that prevent us from indulging in\r\nmisguided self-congratulation.\r\nWe are aware that progress in the field of\r\ndevelopment depends on our own actions and on the\r\ninternational context. Human, civil, cultural, economic,\r\npolitical and social rights have equal importance and\r\ncomplement one another. Having acknowledged the\r\nindivisibility and interdependence of these rights, it is a\r\nmatter of concern that there is still some reluctance to\r\naccept the right of all nations to human development.\r\nThe awarding of the Nobel Prize to Amartya Sen for\r\nhis work on the welfare economy and on the\r\nunderstanding of poverty, inequality and hunger reminds\r\nus that global development must include the fight against\r\ninequalities and extreme poverty. This, however, must not\r\nbe a struggle in which developed countries take part only\r\nout of a feeling of human solidarity; rather, it must be a\r\nstruggle that involves the entire system of nations through\r\nthe creation of appropriate instruments and mechanisms\r\nfor action that offer opportunities for development\r\nthrough trade and investment. We welcomed the views of\r\nHarvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs — published\r\nrecently in The Economist and supported yesterday by\r\nPresident Clinton and today by Vice-Chancellor Fischer\r\nof Germany — regarding the urgent need to establish new\r\nmechanisms to ensure the necessary resources for the\r\npurchase of medicines and vaccines to combat tropical\r\ndiseases, thus securing their development and ensuring\r\ntheir distribution to the poorest and most helpless sectors\r\nof mankind.\r\nCosta Rica has spoken out to have the international\r\neconomic order allow the development of those countries\r\nthat are lagging behind. If we do not take action in this\r\ndirection, the conditions necessary for the long-term\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security will not\r\nbe created. We have constantly advocated a more just and\r\nequitable economic and commercial order, one that will\r\nprovide all nations with access to the benefits of the\r\nglobalization process and that will provide small\r\ndeveloping States with better opportunities to enter into\r\ncommercial agreements. Before the European Union we\r\nhave also advocated secure and tariff-free access for Latin\r\nAmerican agricultural products to the European Union\r\nmarkets, whose protectionism costs Latin America $4.223\r\nbillion dollars annually.\r\nIn order to promote the development of small States,\r\nit is indispensable to establish open trade systems so that\r\ntrade and investment can become engines of economic\r\ngrowth and so that more and better opportunities for\r\nemployment will be created in a region that suffers\r\npoverty and unemployment.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThe developed countries\u0027 trade restrictions are barriers\r\nto our human development, as are the policies of the\r\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrict\r\nsupplies of oil and to raise its price artificially at a time\r\nwhen the traditional exports of Latin America are suffering\r\na dramatic slump in prices.\r\nOn the other hand, the nations gathered here face the\r\nchallenge of building an international financial system that\r\nwill protect small States from economic crises. Small\r\neconomies do not cause the crises, but we do suffer their\r\nadverse effects and we have not received the necessary\r\nsupport to face them. To correct this situation, Costa Rica\r\nproposes the creation of a precautionary fund with a\r\nflexible and speedy financial mechanism to solve the\r\nfinancial emergencies of small and vulnerable States, which\r\nare frequently forgotten by the international financial\r\ncommunity because of their limited global impact.\r\nAs a country that has succeeded in building a culture\r\nof protecting and preserving the environment, we stress, as\r\nwe did at the summit between Europe and Latin America\r\nheld this year in Rio de Janeiro, the urgent need to build an\r\ninternational system that will reward those who protect the\r\nenvironment and penalize those who contaminate or destroy\r\nit. Currently, my country is developing a system of\r\npayments to the owners of forests for environmental\r\nservices and more than one fourth of our territory is\r\nprotected in reservations or national parks. Costa Rica\r\nreiterates the need to take action to better apply the Kyoto\r\nProtocol; to make greater use of new markets; and to\r\ndetermine efficiently the costs of pollution and the profits\r\nof preservation in order to maintain the sustainable use of\r\nnatural resources.\r\nJointly with Norway, we performed the first global\r\ntransaction of certificates of greenhouse-gases reduction.\r\nThis mechanism should receive the support of all countries,\r\nnot only in order to apply the right to human and\r\nsustainable development in each country, but also to extend\r\nthe life of the human species on our planet. Let us recall\r\nthat, in this task, the obligations are shared but\r\ndifferentiated. It is time to move from words to deeds.\r\nIt is clear that, if financial systems of broader\r\ncoverage are not established; if more open trade schemes\r\nare not implemented; if protectionism by developed\r\ncountries, which limits our access to their markets, is not\r\nreduced; and if the global benefits of our forests are not\r\nrecognized, developing countries will see a decline in their\r\nopportunities for economic growth; inequalities will\r\nincrease; poverty will further deepen; political stability and\r\nsocial peace will be threatened; the loss of natural\r\nresources will rise; and illegal immigration towards\r\ndeveloped nations will intensify, all creating an\r\nenvironment of instability and uncertainty harmful to the\r\nnew millennium.\r\nWanting the developed countries to recognize the\r\nright to human development of small countries is not\r\nutopian. It is the real aspiration of those peoples that have\r\nfaced with meagre resources the tragedies of wars and the\r\nwrath of nature. Solidarity and fraternity among nations\r\nmust be genuine. The twenty-first century awaits us. Let\r\nus all join hands. Humankind must enter this new age\r\nunited. The twenty-first century must be the century of\r\nhuman rights — the century of human development.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Costa\r\nRica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Miguel Angel Rodríguez Echeverría, President\r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jules Albert Wijdenbosch, President\r\nof the Republic of Suriname\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Suriname.\r\nMr. Jules Albert Wijdenbosch, President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jules Albert Wijdenbosch, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Wijdenbosch: First of all, I would like to\r\nextend to you, Sir, my warm congratulations on your\r\nelection to the helm of our General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfourth session. We are confident that, in view of your\r\nlong experience in the affairs of our Organization, we\r\nmay look forward to a fruitful and constructive year for\r\nthe work of the General Assembly and its Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nAllow me also to thank Mr. Didier Opertti, who led\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-third session with\r\nremarkable distinction and efficiency.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, we wish\r\nto express our sincere gratitude for his dynamic leadership\r\nand his continued efforts to promote durable peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to join previous speakers in\r\nwelcoming the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru\r\nand the Kingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United\r\nNations family.\r\nThe ongoing globalization process has increased the\r\ninfluence of markets, benefiting a small group of countries,\r\ntheir corporations and people. At the same time, it has\r\nmarginalized the majority of developing nations, in\r\nparticular the small and vulnerable ones, undermining\r\ndecades-long efforts by these countries to create economic\r\nwell-being, social justice and sustainable human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt has, furthermore, eroded trade preferences and\r\nchallenged and undermined the basic principles of\r\ninternational cooperation. It has also eroded international\r\ncommitments to financing for development through the non-\r\nfulfilment of agreed targets of official development\r\nassistance and through the reduction in contributions to the\r\ncore resources of the different programmes and funds of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nThe drop in prices of primary commodities to their\r\nlowest level in a century and a half and the reduction of\r\nofficial development assistance have brought many\r\nGovernments in developing countries face to face with the\r\ndangers of not being in a position to address in a\r\nsatisfactory manner the just socio-economic demands of\r\ntheir respective peoples. In many cases, this has triggered\r\nsocial unrest and political instability and hampered efforts\r\nto achieve sustainable development.\r\nAccess to financing for development has been\r\nrendered more difficult, since the flow of private capital\r\nresources has been limited to certain regions and to a few\r\ndeveloping countries, resulting in a further widening of the\r\ngap between developed and the majority of developing\r\ncountries. As a consequence of this widening gap, poverty\r\ncontinues to rise, leading to increased migration,\r\nenvironmental deterioration, political conflicts and\r\ninstability, which eventually will have long-term negative\r\nconsequences not only for developing, but for developed\r\ncountries as well.\r\nThe international community therefore has a moral\r\nobligation to ensure that these negative influences of\r\nglobalization are contained so that the benefits of\r\nglobalization are shared among all nations. It must also\r\nguarantee special and differential treatment to small,\r\nvulnerable developing countries in the international\r\nsystem. Such treatment must, specifically, extend to the\r\nfinancial, monetary and trading system, in order to\r\nsupport these countries in successfully adjusting to the\r\ndemands of globalization.\r\nThe traffic in illegal drugs has become a serious\r\nthreat to the national security of many nations, in\r\nparticular the small and vulnerable ones such as\r\nSuriname, because it promotes violence, corruption,\r\nmoney-laundering and illegal arms trafficking. In this\r\nway, countries can be manoeuvred into dangerous waters\r\nand be accused of interference in the internal affairs of\r\nothers. It has become practically impossible for Suriname,\r\nwith its limited resources, to combat this scourge on its\r\nown. We are therefore actively pursuing bilateral\r\nagreements with friendly nations to assist us in this\r\ndifficult task. In this context, I would mention the\r\nagreement on cooperation in maritime law enforcement\r\nwhich we recently signed with the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America. We will continue to work\r\nclosely with our neighbours, with friendly nations and\r\nwith the relevant regional and international institutions to\r\ncontribute to the ongoing fight to eradicate this evil from\r\nour region.\r\nThe information superhighway, the Internet, is\r\nnowadays the means of choice for the exchange of\r\ninformation, with a great impact on the social and\r\neconomic life of the international community. This new\r\nform of technology offers great possibilities for\r\naccelerated development in many fields. At the same\r\ntime, however, we should note that the development of\r\nthis technology involves the risk of further marginalizing\r\nvulnerable economies.\r\nIn addition to the positive effects of the Internet, we\r\nsee that the adverse effects on trade, the ever widening\r\ngap in the field of education, the threat to social and\r\ncultural values and the abuse of this technology by people\r\nwith malicious intentions often cause great concern in\r\nthird world societies. I am convinced that in applying\r\ninnovative technology, equal attention should be given to\r\nthe negative effects for societies with limited or no access\r\nto it.\r\nI therefore urge the United Nations to ensure that\r\nthis disparity, with its far-reaching consequences in the\r\nsocio-economic, educational and cultural fields, is\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\neliminated by augmenting the availability of and access to\r\nthis technology. Furthermore, it is of great importance to\r\nset up a legal framework to prevent the abuse and crime\r\nwhich can emanate from use of the Internet.\r\nThe Surinamese Government is of the opinion that its\r\nforeign policy must be fully at the service of its social and\r\neconomic development. In our view, the State should no\r\nlonger fulfil the role it has traditionally performed of\r\nbearing full responsibility for development strategies and\r\nacting as a dirigiste and sometimes even as a welfare State:\r\ndevelopment requires a State which is effective, fulfils the\r\nrole of catalyst and facilitator, and encourages and\r\ncomplements the activities of the private sector.\r\nGood governance is not a luxury, but an absolute\r\nnecessity. In addition, I should say that without an\r\neffectively operating State it would be impossible, from\r\nboth the economic and the social points of view, to\r\nimplement a policy for sustainable development. For\r\ndevelopment does not presuppose that there will be only the\r\nappropriate economic, social and technical inputs: in today\u0027s\r\nworld, sustainable development and welfare can be attained\r\nonly if regulations in a country are supportive so that the\r\nState can contribute to the effectiveness of the intended\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is my Government\u0027s objective to develop our natural\r\nresources in cooperation with identified partners in the\r\ninternational community in such a manner that the\r\nenvironment and the ecosystem will be preserved for future\r\ngenerations. In this light, may the unique decision by\r\nSuriname to offer almost 10 per cent of its territory as a\r\ngift to humankind by creating a nature reserve of nearly\r\n1.16 million hectares, serve as an example. The\r\nenvironment and its biodiversity shall, especially in this\r\nnature reserve, always be fully protected.\r\nThe Government of Suriname is convinced that\r\neffective democratic structures are fundamental to a\r\nsatisfactory enjoyment of democracy, so conditions have\r\nbeen created for the fullest development of Suriname\u0027s\r\ncitizens. Since the beginning of its period of administration,\r\nthe Government has devoted itself to strengthening\r\ndemocratic institutions and anchoring the rule of law. Law\r\nand justice, and effective institutions to implement them,\r\nare the basis for the comprehensive and balanced\r\ndevelopment of the nation.\r\nMy Government\u0027s policy is aimed also at promoting\r\nand safeguarding fundamental human rights and freedoms.\r\nThus, we are creating ideal conditions for the optimal\r\nemployment of human and natural resources in the\r\ninterests of the development of our nation. We realize that\r\ndemocracy, development, peace and social progress do\r\nnot enjoy special attention only within the borders of\r\nSuriname, but that the international community, more\r\nparticularly the United Nations, thoroughly examines,\r\npromotes and safeguards them.\r\nOn 25 May 2000, the Surinamese people will decide,\r\nthrough general and free elections by secret ballot, on the\r\nappointment of a national Government at the highest level\r\nof State. My Government and the independent institutions\r\ndesignated by law are engaged in preparations for the\r\napproaching elections. In this respect, we know we have\r\nthe support of the Organization of American States and\r\nthe United Nations, as well as other international\r\norganizations. Talks on possible financial assistance by\r\nthe European Union are in a phase of conclusion. The\r\nprimary goal of the Government is to hold general and\r\nfree elections, with the greatest possible care, by secret\r\nballot, and once again to confirm to the world Suriname\u0027s\r\nexcellent reputation in this field.\r\nOur world is closing this millennium, in which\r\nhumankind has made enormous progress in science and\r\ntechnology, enhancing its capacity for its own security\r\nand survival. The millennium has been an era of untold\r\nhuman suffering caused by wars waged between and\r\nwithin States, with the means capable of destroying all\r\nthat which the human race has so far achieved. It has also\r\nbeen an era in which many developing countries gained\r\nconstitutional independence. Unfortunately, however, it\r\nhas not brought them economic independence and hence\r\nactual decolonization. Consequently, their full\r\nparticipation in developments relating to the formation of\r\neconomic blocs was seriously impeded.\r\nThis millennium has also seen the birth of a unique\r\nworld Organization, the United Nations, to assist us in\r\novercoming the threat of complete destruction. Let us\r\nallow this unique instrument to assist humanity in\r\nachieving its noble desire for a peaceful world — a world\r\nwith equitable economic, trade and development systems;\r\na world with a protected and safe environment and\r\necosystem; a world in which human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms are protected, promoted and\r\nguaranteed to all its citizens; a world with adequate\r\ndevelopment opportunities for everyone; a world in which\r\nhuman potential can be fully developed, irrespective of\r\nrace, sex, creed or religion; and a world from which all\r\ntendencies and signals regarding recolonization originating\r\nfrom former colonizers are banished.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nLet us all, upon entering the new millennium,\r\ncontribute wholeheartedly to these noble goals.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Suriname\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jules Albert Wijdenbosch, President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Leo A. Falcam, President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia.\r\nMr. Leo A. Falcam, President of the Federated States\r\nof Micronesia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Federated States of Micronesia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Leo A. Falcam, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Falcam: I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Mr. Gurirab, on your\r\nassumption of the office of President of this body. My\r\nGovernment hails the selection of a distinguished leader\r\nfrom a new developing nation to lead the General Assembly\r\ninto the new millennium. We are also confident that you\r\nwill live up to the high standards of your esteemed\r\npredecessor, Mr. Opertti.\r\nIt is with pride that I congratulate and extend a\r\nwelcome to our Pacific island neighbours — the Republic\r\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the great Kingdom\r\nof Tonga — on their admission into the United Nations\r\nfamily. This represents a large contribution from our region\r\nto the attainment of a key goal of the United Nations\r\nsystem, that of universality.\r\nI want to extend the sincere condolences of the people\r\nof the Federated States of Micronesia for the earthquakes\r\nin Turkey, Greece and, more recently, in Taiwan.\r\nWe are saddened by the violence in East Timor as its\r\npeople seek to exercise their right to self-determination.\r\nWe also feel deep sympathy for the innocent\r\nfamilies in Russia, exposed to merciless bomb attacks,\r\nand for those people in all regions of the world who are\r\nsuffering today from violence, terrorism and violations of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nCondolences are also in order on the recent death of\r\nHis Majesty Hassan II of Morocco. His strong personal\r\ncontributions to the process of achieving peace in the\r\nMiddle East will be remembered.\r\nAs Chairman of the South Pacific Forum, I am\r\nprivileged to deliver the following remarks on behalf of\r\nits 16 member countries.\r\nThe South Pacific Forum is a unique organization\r\ncentred on the Heads of Government of 16 Pacific nations\r\nwhich share a very special part of the world: the vast\r\nexpanses of ocean and islands in the central and western\r\nPacific, both north and south of the Equator. Forum\r\nmember countries vary greatly in land area, ocean area,\r\npopulation, resource endowment, economic development,\r\nsocial structures, language and culture. However, we all\r\nshare a common bond as Forum members and have\r\nestablished consensus positions, which transcend our\r\ndiversity, on a wide range of issues. We have also agreed\r\nto work together in pursuit of regional stability and\r\ntowards the well-being of our people. Fourteen of these\r\nForum members are small island developing States. Much\r\nwork has been done to assist these smaller members in\r\ntheir pursuit of sustainable development. Such initiatives\r\nare reflected in proposals by the Forum’s Ministers of\r\neconomics, for extensive economic reforms. Recently,\r\nForum trade Ministers made ground-breaking\r\nrecommendations on trade initiatives which include the\r\nestablishment of a Pacific free trade area consistent with\r\nthe rules and standards of the World Trade Organization.\r\nThese recommendations will be considered by the Forum\r\nheads of Government at their annual meeting in Palau\r\nnext month.\r\nPast practice has been for the formal statement from\r\neach annual meeting, known as the Forum Communiqué,\r\nto be offered for inclusion as a document of the General\r\nAssembly. As the meeting this year will take place after\r\nthe conclusion of the general debate, a request for\r\ninclusion of the Forum Communiqué from the Palau\r\nmeeting will be made at a later date.\r\nLast year, at their meeting in Pohnpei, Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, all 16 Forum leaders reaffirmed\r\ntheir endorsement of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States. The leaders saw the Programme of\r\nAction as a comprehensive framework with great potential\r\nfor the region, and commended implementation efforts\r\nalready under way at the national and regional levels.\r\nIn this regard, Forum leaders strongly supported the\r\nGeneral Assembly initiative to hold, next week, the special\r\nsession to review progress under the Barbados Programme\r\nof Action. Forum countries have maintained close\r\ninvolvement with the preparatory process for the special\r\nsession, and appreciate the strong focus on the concerns of\r\nsmall island developing States in the work of United\r\nNations bodies such as the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. We look forward to outcomes from the\r\nspecial session that will bring a new and stronger focus on\r\nour needs in the pursuit of sustainable development, and\r\nstep up the pace of measures to implement the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nThe common need for accelerated and sustainable\r\neconomic development remains a major focus among the\r\nForum member countries; in fact, the Forum itself has for\r\nsome time been implementing what is known as the Forum\r\nEconomic Action Plan. The Plan attempts to address\r\nregional concerns, which are echoed in the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action. Forum members feel that the\r\nadvancement of this collective, regional Plan is a\r\nconstructive response to the mandate for regional action\r\nexpressed in the Barbados Programme.\r\nIn the context of overall economic development\r\nplanning and assistance and of social and ecological\r\nconcerns, Forum members continue to maintain a keen\r\ninterest in having the United Nations adopt a vulnerability\r\nindex. The existing criteria for determining eligibility for\r\nconcessional aid and trade treatment and for critical\r\nclassifications such as least developed country status are\r\npurely macroeconomic, without any consideration of the\r\nenvironmental and natural risks we face, as a region, on\r\na daily basis. Regional work has already begun under the\r\nSouth Pacific Geoscience Commission on developing an\r\nenvironmental vulnerability index. Only by encompassing\r\nsocial and environmental factors within its assessments\r\nwill the international community be able to achieve equity\r\nwhen addressing the special circumstances and needs of\r\nsmall island developing countries. We appreciate the\r\ncontinuing discussion of this matter by the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development, including at its most recent\r\nsession, and call for tangible action by the year 2000.\r\nIn last year’s general debate, the Forum expressed\r\nrenewed hopes for the United Nations process to combat\r\nanthropogenic global warming, sea-level rise and other\r\nadverse effects of global climate change. We took a\r\nmeasure of pride that our group, which includes both\r\nAnnex I and developing countries, found common ground\r\nat the political level to call for effective action, despite\r\nthe widely differing circumstances of member States. It\r\nseemed that with the successful negotiation of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol, the world’s nations had finally recognized the\r\nneed to begin taking action, on the basis of legally\r\nbinding commitments, to achieve specified targets and\r\ntimetables. Forum members were also relieved by the\r\nrecognition that small island developing States have\r\nparticular needs for assistance with adapting to the effects\r\nof climate change. We welcomed the formulation of\r\nspecific tools, such as the Clean Development\r\nMechanism, which promise to be useful in enabling island\r\ncountries to do their part in combating combat climate\r\nchange, within the framework and parameters of our own\r\nnational circumstances.\r\nThere is of course no time to be lost. People\r\neverywhere are experiencing the sometimes disastrous\r\neffects of climate change. From record-setting droughts to\r\nkiller floods, hurricanes and typhoons, the effects of sea-\r\nlevel rise are already taking a toll on small island States.\r\nUnfortunately, even as scientific evidence of climate\r\nchange has become impossible to ignore, the parties to\r\nthe Convention have yet to go very far towards getting\r\nthe Kyoto process under way. The political will of the\r\nGovernments of the parties simply does not match the\r\ntechnical dedication of delegates to pursuing solutions at\r\nthe numerous meetings that are taking place on this\r\nsubject.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nAfter attending the Conference of the Parties to the\r\nConvention last year in Buenos Aires, I came away with\r\nthe impression that without a real sense of urgency the\r\nConvention might choke on its own complexity, to the\r\ndelight of the minority that opposes it. Unless all countries\r\nalign themselves with the Convention’s purposes and take\r\nurgent collective action, we could find ourselves here at the\r\nseventy-fifth session of the General Assembly, without\r\nbeing any closer to meaningful implementation of the\r\nConvention. By that time, leaders would be expressing\r\nregret over a steadily growing list of climate-related\r\ndisasters and watching the pile of sandbags along the FDR\r\nDrive outside as the tidal surges along the East River grow\r\nstronger. By that time, of course, most island nations in the\r\nForum would have disappeared and we would have failed\r\nutterly. Discussing emission reductions would be a hollow\r\ngesture by then.\r\nEven though our spirits are bolstered by the\r\nencouragement of our annex I Forum partners Australia and\r\nNew Zealand, the 14 Forum small island States grow weary\r\nof calling attention to our special vulnerability to climate\r\nchange and to our status on the front line of potential\r\nworldwide catastrophe. I would sincerely hope that by now\r\na great majority of people, not only in the United Nations\r\nsystem but from all across the globe, have a strong mental\r\npicture of the helpless situation of low-lying islands and\r\ncoastlines in the face of rising seas. We are very grateful\r\nfor the considerable extent to which our pleas have been\r\ntaken into account, but while we may flatter ourselves that\r\nwe have served, in a way, as a voice of conscience for the\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, we wish also\r\nto make positive contributions to its implementation.\r\nThus, the emphasis of all Forum members now is to\r\nassure that we do our part to participate in and to advance\r\nthe considerable amount of work that must be done. The\r\nSouth Pacific Regional Environmental Programme\r\ncontinues to serve our governments as a useful focal point\r\nand to provide valuable expertise. Forum countries have\r\nlong been active in working to understand the potential of\r\nthe Clean Development Mechanism for the region. The\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands recently hosted an\r\nimportant workshop on the Clean Development Mechanism\r\nthat was attended by more than 40 countries, and in June,\r\nAustralia and the Forum secretariat hosted a workshop in\r\nNadi.\r\nWe are severely hampered, however, by the shortage\r\nof personnel and financial resources to maintain continuous\r\nparticipation in the host of ongoing activities. The United\r\nNations and bilateral donors have been very generous in\r\nsupporting our attendance at conferences, but the time\r\ndemands on our short-staffed officials at home and abroad\r\ncan be overwhelming, considering other growing concerns\r\nsuch as biodiversity, the oceans and coral reefs.\r\nI know that this problem is by no means unique to\r\nForum island countries, nor even to small developing\r\ncountries as a group. But for us, as well as for many\r\nothers, we ask that these limitations should not be\r\ndisregarded by larger countries and organizations in the\r\nmanagement of the international agenda. Once again, we\r\nexpress sincere appreciation for the support of donors that\r\nhave made our participation possible. In addition, we\r\nwould emphasize the importance of applying a\r\ncoordinated approach to scheduling in order to facilitate\r\nthe participation of small delegations that would not wish\r\nto be marginalized by overlapping meetings on topics of\r\ncritical concern to us.\r\nFinally, another topic of concern for the Forum at\r\nthe next annual meeting will be the continuing shipment\r\nby industrialized Powers of plutonium and radioactive\r\nwastes through our region. Forum nations have\r\nconsistently expressed their concerns on this issue,\r\nespecially about liability and compensation arrangements\r\nin the event of an accident. From 16 to 17 September this\r\nyear, discussions took place in Suva between the legal\r\nexperts of the Forum countries and the representatives of\r\nFrance, Japan and the United Kingdom concerning trans-\r\nshipments of nuclear materials through the region. This\r\nmeeting was arranged by the Forum secretariat, in line\r\nwith the 1998 Forum Communiqué. We are encouraged\r\nby this development and strongly urge the representatives\r\nof the three shipping States to demonstrate their readiness\r\nto explore innovative ways to address the concerns of\r\nForum members: there is more at stake than the well-\r\nbeing and comfort of the larger populations in the North.\r\nPutting this disregard for the sovereign interests of\r\nForum countries to one side for a moment, the Pacific\r\nOcean is a vital breadbasket for the entire planet: any\r\naccident will have serious and adverse implications far\r\nbeyond our shores for generations to come.\r\nForum countries have derived some encouragement\r\nfrom the decision by France, Japan and the United\r\nKingdom to consult with Forum members regarding\r\nsafety and compensation arrangements for the most recent\r\nshipment of mixed oxide fuel from Europe to Japan. We\r\nare further encouraged by the decision of the three\r\nshipping States to provide information on the shipping\r\nroutes of the two ships carrying the fuel, consistent with\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nthe rigorous safety and security obligations with which they\r\nmust comply under the international conventions governing\r\ntransport of nuclear materials, including the Convention on\r\nthe Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials.\r\nWe, the Forum countries, earnestly hope to make\r\nsome inroads, not only in the immediate situation but, more\r\nimportantly, in the long run, into the ethical consciences of\r\nthe developed nations. Since time immemorial they have\r\nregarded our region as a convenient area for any kind of\r\ndangerous or undesirable activity that serves their interests\r\nat home. With the welcome admission to this body of three\r\nmore of our number, we are now numerous enough in this\r\nforum to assert forcefully that we wish no further invasion\r\nto place our peoples at risk, irrespective of the reasons\r\nothers may have for choosing to disregard our concerns.\r\nI have by no means touched on every topic of concern\r\nthat is to be discussed at the next Forum meeting.\r\nFollowing that meeting, as I stated earlier, the complete\r\nCommuniqué will be submitted to this body, and I\r\ncommend it to all delegations.\r\nThe views I have expressed on behalf of the South\r\nPacific Forum are, of course, fully embraced by my\r\ncountry, the Federated States of Micronesia. I would like\r\nnow to address other issues, speaking only for my own\r\nsmall island developing State.\r\nSince 1991, when the Federated States of Micronesia\r\nwas admitted to membership in this body, we have\r\nexperienced — from the viewpoint of a developing country\r\nand particularly as a small island developing State — a\r\ntruly unique decade in multilateral relations. We emerged\r\non the international scene just in time to become a part of\r\nthe movement that radically changed previous notions about\r\ndevelopment, namely the Rio process. The timing could not\r\nhave been better for us. Just as we took up the task of\r\nformulating our own agenda for the future of our island\r\nnation, the world as a whole came to recognize that the\r\nissues of environment and development are not opposed\r\nbut, rather, are intertwined. We thus incorporated into our\r\ndevelopment planning from the outset a mandate not just\r\nfor development, but for sustainable development.\r\nWe feel fortunate in this regard and in how the\r\nprinciple of sustainability is fully integral to our activities,\r\nfor, while we are deeply appreciative of the concerns that\r\nother nations have shown for the difficulties faced by small\r\nisland States like ourselves, and while we remain anxious\r\nfor the further implementation of the Barbados Programme\r\nof Action, we realize that the action referred to must be,\r\nfirst and foremost, our own. We ourselves must be very\r\nserious not only in recognizing our special development\r\nobstacles but in instituting and carrying out programmes\r\nto overcome them in a sustainable way. And this must be\r\ndone, not as a temporary, short-term or even medium-\r\nterm proposition, but as a way of life for generations to\r\ncome.\r\nNo amount of outside assistance can provide\r\nsustainable development. As small-island countries, we\r\nmust individually and collectively commit ourselves to\r\nstaying the course once we have seen it and possess the\r\nmeans to navigate it. Without that commitment, our sails\r\nwill never fill and we will remain adrift on a journey that\r\ncan only come to a sad end.\r\nAs a new member of the international community,\r\nwe have been faced with the need to rapidly become\r\nfamiliar with the dynamics of multilateral interaction\r\nwithin the United Nations system while at the same time\r\ntrying to acquire a practical working knowledge of the\r\nvarious simultaneous processes. But there is no\r\napprenticeship here at the United Nations.\r\nFrom the outset, it has been our full responsibility to\r\nparticipate, on a basis of equality, in the ongoing work of\r\nnumerous bodies directly integral to the United Nations or\r\nrelated to it. It has been, and continues to be, a\r\ndemanding experience, but inasmuch as we have learned\r\nabout others, we are also learning more about ourselves\r\nand moving towards greater maturity as a nation.\r\nWe have also developed a deep appreciation for the\r\noften unheralded but vital work of translating global\r\nproblems into solutions that is pursued faithfully by the\r\nthousands of administrative and diplomatic members of\r\nthe United Nations family. It is difficult to conceive of a\r\nfuture in which the nations of our ever-shrinking planet\r\nwill not have a forum such as this — the United Nations.\r\nYet one cannot help but be uneasy on hearing\r\nwhispers of discouragement as the United Nations is\r\nchallenged by issues that seem to grow in number and\r\ncomplexity. We sometimes hear that perhaps the\r\nOrganization has outlived its usefulness and has\r\ninadequate capacity to deal with global crises in the areas\r\nof security, social justice and the environment. Some are\r\nsaid to feel that other, more sharply focused bodies would\r\nbe better suited to dealing with the anticipated crises of\r\nthe new millennium.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nWithout question, the effective responsiveness of this\r\nOrganization is constantly being challenged. But this is not\r\na sign of failure, nor of a lack of capacity. Neither does it\r\nsuggest that we need another instrument. It is, rather, an\r\nindication of the growing interconnectedness of the global\r\ncommunity, and of the growing inclination among nations\r\nto find and recognize their common interests and to work\r\ntogether to advance global peace and harmony.\r\nIn order to maintain and improve the responsiveness\r\nof the United Nations in a world of increasing demands and\r\nchallenges, it is necessary that we continually evolve and\r\nadapt effectively in our pursuit of the ideals of the Charter\r\nof this Organization. Only in this way can we keep the\r\nOrganization on a positive course and faithfully translate\r\nthe mandates of the Charter into terms of continuing\r\nrelevance. This is the attitude with which we must approach\r\nreform. It is not a consequence of inadequacy, which the\r\nword “reform” may suggest, but, rather, it is a positive and\r\nevolutionary process.\r\nThis is easily said, but, as we all know, it is very\r\ndifficult to put into practice. Even so, we must not allow\r\nthat high degree of difficulty to plunge us into frustration\r\nand defeat. The great achievements of those who have\r\ncome before us in the last 54 years must be honoured by\r\nour unshakable determination to take the United Nations\r\nseriously into the next millennium as the single most\r\neffective multilateral instrument for the betterment of\r\nhumankind.\r\nIf the United Nations is to maintain and even improve\r\nits capacity to deal with major issues and improve the lot\r\nof disadvantaged peoples, I respectfully suggest that there\r\nis a need for broader incorporation of developing countries\r\nin the decision-making process. More and more, it seems,\r\na relatively small group of developed countries are seen on\r\nthe front lines here and in other related international bodies.\r\nThere is a perception that, despite the formal application of\r\nthe rules, the substantive participation of developing\r\ncountries in dealing with world problems is in reality\r\nwaning rather than increasing. This does not bode well for\r\nthe future of international relations. As the trend towards\r\nglobalization continues to strengthen, this body as a whole\r\nwill need to be more involved in making important\r\ndecisions — not a permanent 5, not a G-7, but a “G-188”.\r\nProbably the single most urgently needed reform is the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council. Naturally, such an\r\nimportant step must not be taken in haste, but by this time\r\nwe should be closer to finding an acceptable formulation.\r\nThe plain fact is that the openness of the most powerful\r\nnations to accept rational and realistic change in the\r\nSecurity Council is a key indicator of the future of global\r\nmultilateral relations in general, and of this Organization\r\nin particular. The impact of success with this issue would\r\nbe felt in positive ways throughout the United Nations\r\nOrganization, and it would stimulate renewed confidence\r\nin the Charter. That result alone is badly needed and\r\nshould itself inspire greater effort to overcome the\r\ndifficulties ahead.\r\nIt would be unrealistic to ignore the inevitability of\r\nthe fact that larger, more powerful nations will most often\r\ntake the lead in the United Nations. In fact, they should\r\ndo so as a matter of responsibility; they possess the\r\nresources and the capacity. However, leadership should\r\nnot become domination, and it should not leave the\r\ndeveloping world marginalized. I therefore emphasize the\r\nneed for a restructured Security Council. I also visualize\r\na General Assembly that remains in the forefront of\r\nglobal decision-making, for real outcomes on real issues.\r\nBeing from a Pacific island nation, I naturally have\r\nparticular concerns about our region. Without demeaning\r\nin any way the considerable attention that we do receive,\r\nI must say that the Pacific islands region often takes a\r\nback seat in the councils of the greater Powers, which are\r\nprone to include only the Pacific rim countries among\r\ntheir primary concerns. This can be understood, given our\r\nsmall populations and land masses, which only underscore\r\nour remoteness in the vast Pacific Ocean.\r\nBut it should not be forgotten that we Pacific\r\nislanders are custodians of some of the world\u0027s greatest\r\nuntapped wealth. In the coming millennium, our region is\r\ncertain to play a greater role than ever before in meeting\r\nthe needs of the rest of the world for food and mineral\r\nresources. If these resources are to be conserved in the\r\nproper way and harvested in a sustainable manner, the\r\npeoples of the Pacific islands must be dealt with fairly,\r\nand on a basis of partnership with the developed world.\r\nAnd the time to start is now.\r\nThe growing global involvement with and reliance\r\nupon the tremendous resource base in our region must\r\nrest on a foundation of regional security. Nowhere is\r\nthere a better example of the need for comprehensive\r\nsecurity in the modern sense, extending beyond military\r\nconsiderations and also including economic, social and\r\nenvironmental security.\r\nThis leads me to the present need for proper\r\nstewardship of the oceans and seas throughout the world.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThis subject was recently discussed in depth by the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, and it is on our\r\nagenda at this session. I want to emphasize that the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia solidly supports the\r\npositions expressed by the Alliance of Small Island States\r\non this subject. We believe that oceans and seas present a\r\nspecial, even crucial, case for international cooperation and\r\ncoordination, and that the General Assembly is the\r\nappropriate body to provide this oversight. Indeed, it was\r\nmandated to do so by Agenda 21.\r\nFurthermore, the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea provides the framework for action in this\r\narea. We thus have existing structures; there is no need to\r\ncreate new institutions. We believe that the size of the task\r\nwill require continuing effort on an annual basis, so that an\r\nongoing working-group format within the context of\r\npreparations for each annual General Assembly will be\r\nmore rewarding than a large, one-time conference. Above\r\nall, the process must seek the widest possible input,\r\ndrawing upon expertise at the regional level, and providing\r\nassistance to ensure the participation of developing\r\ncountries, especially small island States.\r\nIn these brief moments it is not possible to express all\r\nour views on all the matters we deem important. Of\r\nnecessity, therefore, I must leave much to the work of our\r\nrepresentatives in the Committees here and in other United\r\nNations organs throughout the year.\r\nI wish, however, to plead with this body for a\r\nuniversal awakening to the single most important reality of\r\nour lives today. This reality is that all our interests become\r\nmore closely linked with each passing generation. We are\r\nall responsible for turning back the consequences of our\r\npast selfish behaviour. The destruction of war, the improper\r\nstewardship of our natural resources and the pollution of\r\nour living space are looming global disasters. Combined,\r\nthey will overwhelm the Earth\u0027s population unless we find\r\ncommon ground and take action.\r\nThat common ground exists. It exists here. It does not\r\nask us to surrender our nationhood or our cultures. It is the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, a visionary document that\r\nhas guided our troubled world through the faltering steps of\r\nincreasing multilateral awareness, and today provides a\r\nformat for our very survival. God grant that we will have\r\nthe political will to sustain it.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Leo A. Falcam, President of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Frederick Chiluba, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zambia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Frederick Chiluba, President of the Republic of\r\nZambia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Frederick Chiluba, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Chiluba: I join other speakers who have\r\nalready addressed the Assembly, Sir, in congratulating\r\nyou on your well-deserved election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Your\r\nunanimous election is a clear demonstration of the\r\nconfidence this Assembly has in you and in your country,\r\nNamibia, with which my country enjoys very friendly and\r\nwarm relations. It is especially significant that you come\r\nfrom Namibia, a country whose independence stands as\r\na crowning moment in our Organization’s support for the\r\nright of peoples under colonial and foreign domination to\r\nself-determination and independence. I am confident that,\r\ngiven your experience and diplomatic skills, you will\r\nguide the work of this session successfully.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to commend your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti of\r\nUruguay, for the able manner in which he presided over\r\nthe fifty-third session.\r\nIn the same vein, I would like to place on record my\r\ncountry’s deepest appreciation of the work of the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nwhose leadership is well respected and has given new\r\nimpetus to the implementation of the United Nations\r\nreform programme.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nAs you rightly observed in your statement to this\r\nAssembly, Sir, the fifty-fourth session is the last to be\r\nconvened in the twentieth century, a century that saw the\r\ncreation of the United Nations from the ashes and ravages\r\nof the Second World War. Indeed, the world cannot but\r\nthank the founding fathers of our Organization for their\r\nforesight and wisdom. The relevance of this Organization\r\nhas continued to grow since its inception, and is today\r\nexemplified by the universality of its membership, which\r\nhas grown from the original 51 States in 1945 to the\r\npresent 188 States.\r\nIt goes without saying that since the membership of\r\nthe United Nations has been growing, there should have\r\nbeen a continuous and corresponding process of reform of\r\nthe decision-making structures and processes of the\r\nOrganization in order to make the world body as\r\nrepresentative as possible. It is a matter of considerable\r\ndisappointment, however, that while reform of the\r\nadministrative structures has, to a large degree, been\r\naccomplished, reform of the Security Council has not\r\nmoved in tandem.\r\nAs members are all aware, the creation of the United\r\nNations was intended to strengthen international peace and\r\nsecurity. Regrettably, a number of States continue to be\r\nthreatened in our time by the dangerous proliferation of\r\nsmall arms and light weapons acquired by non-state entities.\r\nThe continued proliferation and illegal transfer of small\r\narms, among other factors, are responsible for the supply of\r\nthe weapons being used in conflict situations across the\r\nAfrican continent. I would therefore like to appeal to all\r\nMember States to support and strengthen the United\r\nNations monitoring mechanisms on the transfer of these\r\narms, particularly to non-state entities, in order to forestall\r\nthis problem.\r\nRelated to the problem of small arms is the question\r\nof landmines planted in large tracts of land in many\r\ncountries, rendering unusable what otherwise is productive\r\nland. The impact of landmines has also had a telling toll on\r\nthe provision of social services in the affected countries. I\r\nequally appeal to Member States, parties to the United\r\nNations Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction, to implement the Maputo\r\nDeclaration and programme of action, adopted in May this\r\nyear. Only a strong and viable United Nations can\r\nconstitute the much-needed viable vehicle to achieve this\r\ngoal.\r\nMy delegation is therefore deeply concerned about\r\nthe continued deterioration of the financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations. This situation is well known to all of us\r\nin this Assembly, as it has been the focus of our\r\ndiscussions for the past five years. Reform of the United\r\nNations will not be implemented effectively if the\r\nfinancial situation is not seriously addressed. It is the\r\ninescapable duty of all of us to honour our obligations by\r\nensuring that we pay our assessed contributions in full, on\r\ntime and without conditions. This will enable the\r\nOrganization to function smoothly and more effectively to\r\nexecute the mandate we have entrusted to it.\r\nThat among many other reasons is why we want to\r\nbuild strong economies in Africa to enable us shoulder\r\nour obligations. But external debt remains both a burden\r\nand a major impediment to the development process of\r\nmany developing countries, including my country,\r\nZambia. While we welcome the recent outcome of the\r\nGroup of Eight meeting held in Cologne, Germany, on\r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)\r\nInitiative, the measures for faster, broader and deeper debt\r\nrelief, in our view, will not be sufficient to resolve the\r\nexternal debt problem of developing countries, especially\r\nthe poorest among them, unless they are translated into\r\nreal tangible, practical economic development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIt is the view of my Government that the Group of\r\nEight target for debt relief of about $100 billion for the\r\npoorest countries in the world, the majority of which are\r\nin Africa, will have little effect on the problem unless the\r\nterms of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative are further revised in such a way as to make\r\nthem more flexible and better tailored to suit the specific\r\nconditions of the targeted countries.\r\nMany of us in the developing countries understand\r\nthat, in order to survive and contribute positively in the\r\nglobal markets, we need to make our economies more\r\ncompetitive. In this regard, many of our countries have\r\nembarked on the implementation of structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes. Our efforts are, however, hampered by the\r\nhuge debt burden which takes away large amounts of\r\nresources from our countries through debt servicing. The\r\ndeclining levels of official development assistance and\r\nforeign direct investment to our countries, combined with\r\nthe debt burden, have made economic reforms difficult\r\nand have slowed down the pace of economic growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThe solution to this is for all concerned to approach\r\nthe question of debt with open minds, with a view to\r\nfinding a lasting solution to the problem.\r\nAdded to that problem is the spread of HIV/AIDS.\r\nThis is a matter of grave concern to my country and to\r\nAfrica as a whole. This disease has continued to overwhelm\r\nthe continent and to rob it of its meagre material and\r\nfinancial resources through devastation of its youthful and\r\nactive population. It is therefore necessary for all humanity\r\nto rise to regard HIV/AIDS as a global problem and to act\r\nin unison. I therefore call upon the international community\r\nto redouble its efforts in fighting this scourge. Let me take\r\nthis opportunity to report to this body that last week, from\r\n12 to 16 September 1999, Zambia hosted the eleventh\r\nInternational Conference on AIDS and Sexually\r\nTransmitted Diseases in Africa. The holding of that\r\nConference, which adopted a programme of action to fight\r\nthe spread of this deadly disease in Africa in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, is among other things a demonstration of the\r\nAfrican continent’s commitment to fight against this deadly\r\ndisease. It is my hope that the United Nations will therefore\r\nembrace the outcome of the Conference and provide the\r\nnecessary leadership in the fight against this pandemic,\r\nwhich threatens the very survival of humankind. The AIDS\r\nproblem deserves our collective moral and political will to\r\ncombat it successfully.\r\nLet me now turn to the phenomenon of the conflicts\r\nwhich have continued to bedevil Africa. In our own\r\nSouthern African subregion, the conflicts in Angola and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo are not only a threat to\r\npeace and security but have also been a major impediment\r\nto the economic development of the region.\r\nThe resumption of hostilities in Angola in December\r\n1998, after four years of relative peace following the\r\nsigning of the Lusaka Protocol, is regrettable. As the\r\nAssembly is aware, this unfortunate state of affairs was\r\noccasioned by the intransigence of UNITA with regard to\r\nthe implementation of the remaining tasks under the Lusaka\r\nProtocol. Every effort should therefore be made to bring an\r\nend to the hostilities.\r\nWith regard to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the\r\nAssembly will recall that on 2 August 1998 a conflict\r\nerupted in that country. In response to this serious\r\ndevelopment, a series of efforts by regional heads of State\r\nand the Organization of African Unity (OAU) were\r\nimmediately undertaken in search of a peaceful solution to\r\nthe conflict. At the summit held at Victoria Falls,\r\nZimbabwe, from 7 to 8 September 1998, the regional heads\r\nof State mandated me to chair the regional mediation\r\neffort, with the assistance of OAU.\r\nFor a period of almost a year, I have, on behalf of\r\nour region, carried out exhaustive consultations inside and\r\noutside Zambia, and convened a number of meetings at\r\nthe level of experts and Foreign Affairs and Defence\r\nMinisters.\r\nLet me state here that, right from the outset, regional\r\nleaders acknowledged the need to involve the Congolese\r\nrebel movement in the mediation process to ensure that\r\nthe outcome would be respected by and acceptable to all.\r\nThe process initially engaged the rebel movement through\r\na proximity mechanism. Later, however, the rebels, who\r\nnow included the Movement for the Liberation of the\r\nCongo (MLC), were invited to participate directly in the\r\npeace talks with all the other parties to the conflict.\r\nOn 10 July 1999, our perseverance on the regional\r\nand Pan-African levels finally paid off when heads of\r\nState of all the six States parties to the conflict signed the\r\nCeasefire Agreement in Lusaka. Unfortunately, a split in\r\nthe Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) the previous\r\nMay led to differences over who should sign the\r\nAgreement on behalf of the movement, which prevented\r\nthem from appending their signature on that occasion.\r\nThe other non-State party to the conflict, the MLC, also\r\nchose not to sign the Agreement until the differences\r\nwithin the RCD were resolved.\r\nIn order to secure the signatures of the RCD and the\r\nMLC, I was mandated by the regional heads of State to\r\ncarry out further consultations with the two movements.\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that these efforts\r\nculminated in the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement by\r\nthe MLC and the RCD on 1 August and 31 August 1999\r\nrespectively.\r\nAllow me at this juncture to place on record my\r\nsincere appreciation for the cooperation and assistance I\r\nreceived from all my colleagues in the region and other\r\nAfrican leaders, the United Nations, OAU and the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) in\r\nthe execution of my mandate. The Ceasefire Agreement\r\nis an all-embracing document which addresses all aspects\r\nof the conflict, including the security concerns of all the\r\ncountries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nI wish to inform the Assembly that the\r\nimplementation process of the Agreement has already\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nbegun in earnest. Both the Political Committee and the\r\nJoint Military Commission met on 2 and 3 September 1999\r\nin Lusaka with the participation of all members except the\r\nMLC, whose representatives were not able to travel to\r\nLusaka because of logistical constraints.\r\nAmong the issues considered by the meetings were:\r\nfirst, the formal installation of the Chairman of the\r\nCommission, Brigadier-General Rachid Lallali, from\r\nAlgeria; the budget of the Joint Military Commission; its\r\nstructures; and its programme of work.\r\nThe representative of OAU briefed the meetings on\r\nOAU activities in support of the peace process in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and the United Nations\r\nrepresentative briefed them on the relationship that is\r\nexpected to prevail between the United Nations and the\r\nJoint Military Commission. The Commission is scheduled\r\nto meet again on 10 October 1999.\r\nFor peace to prevail in the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo, United Nations support for the successful and\r\ncomprehensive implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement\r\nis of paramount importance. For this reason, I wish to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his timely and positive\r\nresponse in sending a team of military liaison personnel to\r\nthe region. The United Nations must move more\r\nexpeditiously than it has in the past if the job it does is to\r\nbe commensurate with the tasks facing it in the field.\r\nTo this end, I make an earnest appeal to the United\r\nNations that the Organization, first, should authorize and\r\nsupport the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping\r\nforce in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with an\r\nappropriate mandate and, on an appropriate scale, based on\r\nthe assessed needs on the ground; second, it should quickly\r\ndispatch the technical survey team to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo in addition to the team of military\r\nliaison personnel which has already been sent to that\r\ncountry and some of its neighbours; third, it should make\r\navailable adequate resources for the peacekeeping mission;\r\nfourth, it should extend necessary and adequate support to\r\nfacilitate the process of internal dialogue within the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo; fifth, it should help in\r\nthe mobilization of humanitarian assistance for the\r\nCongolese refugees and internally displaced persons and\r\nfacilitate their return and resettlement; and sixth, it should\r\nassist with resources for the economic reconstruction of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nI need not remind the Assembly of the solemn and\r\nimportant responsibility that the United Nations bears on\r\nbehalf of us all in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. It is, therefore, incumbent upon it to ensure\r\nthat peace prevails in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. To this end, it should learn from the lessons of\r\nthe past and avoid costly mistakes.\r\nTime is of the essence. What is equally of the\r\nessence is the need to address the root causes of the\r\npoverty confronting third world countries. The world\r\ncommunity must tackle those root causes with speed and\r\nurgency.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is meeting\r\nagainst a backdrop of growing tensions and armed\r\nconflicts, especially in the third world. These\r\ndevelopments, coming towards the close of the twentieth\r\ncentury, are an indictment of the world’s global\r\nstructures, which pose today, more than at any other time\r\nin history, a challenge to the very articles of faith upon\r\nwhich this organization was founded. The challenges\r\ncannot be wished away, nor can they be remedied by\r\nempty words. Global poverty can be eradicated only with\r\na concerted global programme. Solving the issue of\r\npoverty would solve the problem of conflict and\r\ninstability in the developing countries, and unless the\r\nworld addresses these underlying causes of conflict, they\r\nwill continue to be major sources of friction that will\r\nthreaten and undermine international peace and security.\r\nEvents in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in\r\nKosovo and now in East Timor cannot but exert more\r\npressure on the time and resources of the international\r\ncommunity in general and particularly on the Security\r\nCouncil. But this is the mission of that world body: to\r\nattend to just such areas of conflict. Admittedly, these are\r\nthe most perilous times Africa has ever faced. The\r\nmultiple dangers of armed conflict and general political\r\ninstability and the ever-growing danger posed by the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic can only call for concerted joint\r\nworld efforts to help reduce the dangers that face Africa\r\nand the world in general.\r\nThere are various ways the world can come to the\r\naid of Africa, the most important of which are through\r\naid and by creating conditions to make it possible for\r\nAfrica to trade with the international community on terms\r\nacceptable to all. Africa is not asking for charity. No,\r\nAfrica is asking for genuine trade. Africa is not asking for\r\narms. No, Africa is asking for fair and equitable\r\nrecompense for its labour and resources. Africa is not\r\nasking for pity, but genuine partnership based on mutual\r\ninterests.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThe relationship between poverty and political\r\ninstability can no longer be in any way doubted. It is not\r\ngood enough for the developed world to demand good\r\ngovernance — an indefinable term — while creating\r\nconditions of poverty by bad governance in the economic\r\narea. Justice must prevail in our economic relations in order\r\nto lay the foundation for political and social justice.\r\nA start should now be made by reviewing the\r\ninequitable conditions imposed by the World Trade\r\nOrganization, which, if maintained, will only ensure\r\ncontinued marginalization of third world countries,\r\ncondemning them to poverty and further instability.\r\nI am quite aware that this forum may not be the\r\nappropriate one for addressing these issues, but it definitely\r\nhas the right people to address the issues I have raised.\r\nTherefore, my fervent prayer and hope is that we enter the\r\nnew millennium with a renewed sense of unity of purpose\r\nto eradicate manifest global injustices and create a more\r\nequitable world where want will not create chaos and\r\ninstability.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Zambia for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Frederick Chiluba, President of the Republic of\r\nZambia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: As members can see, it has taken us\r\nalmost three hours to hear five speakers, and we still have\r\nseven speakers remaining on the list for this meeting. In\r\norder to accommodate all the remaining speakers on the\r\nlist, this meeting will most likely continue for at least\r\nanother two hours.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to again remind\r\nmembers that the General Assembly, in paragraph 21 of the\r\nannex to resolution 51/241, indicated a voluntary guideline\r\nof up to 20 minutes for each statement in the general\r\ndebate. I strongly appeal to speakers to make an extra effort\r\nto observe this 20-minute voluntary guideline for the\r\ngeneral debate so that we can finish hearing all speakers at\r\na reasonable hour.\r\nI thank you for your kind cooperation.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Denzil Douglas,\r\nPrime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister of Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, The\r\nHonourable Denzil Douglas, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Douglas (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I wish most\r\nheartily to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to lead\r\nthis body at this most significant time, as we stand at the\r\nthreshold of the new millennium. I am persuaded that\r\nyour antecedents, both in your own country and here at\r\nthe United Nations, have eminently prepared you for the\r\nrole that you have been elected to fill. I, for my part,\r\npledge the total support and assistance of my delegation\r\nfor the accomplishment of your great task.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the work of your\r\npredecessor, the Foreign Minister of Uruguay, a\r\nrepresentative of the Group of Latin America and\r\nCaribbean States, who steered the General Assembly\r\nthrough the difficult period of the fifty-third session.\r\nOnce again, I would like to express my unreserved\r\nesteem for the Secretary-General, whose charm, affability\r\nand intellect have been of great benefit to the United\r\nNations system. It is clear to all that Mr. Kofi Annan is\r\nmaking a unique contribution to the development of this,\r\nour Organization. My country, Saint Kitts and Nevis, its\r\nGovernment, its people and myself heartily commend the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to say a word of\r\nwelcome and congratulations to the three new Member\r\nStates admitted at the opening of this fifty-fourth session:\r\nthe Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga. As representative of a small island\r\nState from the Caribbean, I am happy to welcome them\r\nas small island States from the Pacific region. I recognize\r\nthat even though they have only now attained full\r\nmembership in the United Nations they are well seized of\r\ntheir obligations and they will play their full part in\r\nupholding the principles of the Charter. Once again I\r\ncongratulate them and wish them well for the future.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nWhen this Organization was formed, some 54 years\r\nago, it ushered in bright hopes and held out bright promise.\r\nIt was an Organization dedicated to the ending of war and\r\nthe enhancement of peace. Nations were to have beaten\r\ntheir swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning\r\nhooks. I wish that, as we come to the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury and embark upon the twenty-first, we really could\r\nhave celebrated this bright new world. But even now,\r\nduring the closing months of the closing year of the\r\nmillennium, mankind has been afflicted by violence and\r\nbrutality, and man\u0027s inhumanity to man has been expressed\r\nin some of the most outrageous fashions.\r\nThe recent development in Kosovo, the terribly\r\ndisturbing stories of the human tragedy that befell its\r\npeople, the injustices that were highlighted during that\r\nconflict — all this constitutes a severe limitation in the\r\nwork of the United Nations.\r\nMy Government takes the view that genocidal activity,\r\nfrom whichever sources it emanates, is unacceptable and a\r\nviolation of international law. The United Nations must\r\ntherefore be vigilant as it continues its pacification efforts.\r\nNow that the job of rebuilding is under way, let us look\r\nforward — look forward with hope to an era of peace and\r\nreconstruction — and let us hope that what may have\r\nseemed initially a failure may turn out to be part of the\r\nstriking success of the United Nations.\r\nAs if there is to be no respite from the challenges\r\naffecting this body, while we thought we were overcoming\r\nthe problems of Kosovo there flared up the problem of East\r\nTimor. Saint Kitts and Nevis, as a small State, has been\r\nappalled at the wanton violence and death visited upon the\r\nEast Timorese people since the referendum. This world\r\nbody must roundly condemn the inhumane activities\r\nperpetrated against the people of East Timor only because\r\nin seeking to fulfil their aspirations to live as a sovereign\r\npeople, they gave legitimate expression them.\r\nMy Government would like to commend the work of\r\nthe Secretary-General and all others who have sought to\r\npull us back from this abyss of human disaster. Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis urges the Indonesian authorities to discharge\r\ntheir obligations with maturity and to work together with\r\nthe international community for the preservation of the\r\npeace and the protection of the people of East Timor. We\r\nwelcome the acceptance by the Indonesian authorities of an\r\ninternational protective force and we pray that the people of\r\nEast Timor will have their rights respected and be able to\r\ndevelop in freedom and democracy. We commend the\r\nrecent commitment of the international community to the\r\nreconstruction and development of Kosovo and, now, to\r\nthe people of East Timor.\r\nWe still hope, however, that there will be equal\r\nresponsiveness to the people of the Great Lakes region\r\nand the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nSince I have referred to the outrages in areas of the\r\nworld which constitute a dark blot on the human\r\ncondition, perhaps I ought to balance my remarks by\r\nrecognizing that, in one area of the world, the Middle\r\nEast, where peace for such a long time seemed illusive,\r\na process of peace is now finally under way. I should\r\nplace on record the appreciation of my country for all\r\nthose who are assisting in the process of peace. We must\r\ncontinue to support the efforts of the peacemakers in\r\norder to ensure that the rhetoric of violence is silenced.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis urges the United Nations and\r\nfellow world leaders to work towards preserving the\r\nintegrity of the country and the people of Kuwait and to\r\nensure that they enjoy the dignity of life without fear. The\r\nterritorial integrity of their national must be respected and\r\npreserved and the Security Council solution concerning\r\nIraqi aggression in Kuwait should be fully implemented.\r\nBy the same token, Saint Kitts and Nevis notes the\r\npeace process in Ireland and compliments all those who\r\nare contributing to the process. The world community\r\nshould give its support to this initiative so that those who\r\nare seeking to retard the process of peaceful development\r\nwill find no encouragement.\r\nAt this point, Saint Kitts and Nevis would like to\r\nexpress profound condolences to the Government of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan on the loss of lives which\r\nresulted from the recent devastating earthquake. We hope\r\nthat the process of recovery will be speedy. I call on the\r\ninternational community, therefore, to come to the\r\nassistance of Taiwan, which in times past has assisted\r\nwillingly in bringing relief to countries facing similar\r\ndisasters.\r\nLet me know say a word about the unsettled issue of\r\nthe Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. In\r\ndoing so, let me first make it clear that it never has been\r\nand is not now the intention of my country to interfere in\r\nthe internal affairs or to give offence to any State\r\nMember of the United Nations. Saint Kitts and Nevis is\r\npersuaded that the Chinese people have the capacity and\r\nthe accumulated wisdom to find a solution to whatever\r\ntheir differences appear to be, but our relationship with\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nthe authorities of the Republic of China, with whom we\r\nhave conducted diplomatic relations since our independence\r\nin 1983, convinces me that the 22 million Chinese on\r\nTaiwan have a valuable contribution which they can make\r\nto international dialogue. The record of their development\r\nas a freedom-loving, peaceful, pluralistic democracy; the\r\nmiraculous rebuilding of their economy; and their\r\ncontribution to developing countries are all attributes which,\r\nin our view, require that they be recognized as being\r\ncapable of making a contribution in international forums,\r\nincluding those of the United Nations.\r\nIn addition to the scourges of human conflict, there are\r\nother evils which still stare us in the face in these last few\r\nmonths of the closing year of the century. Poverty still\r\nconfronts the vast majority of mankind. Children are still\r\ndying of malnutrition and some, in order to get food, have\r\nto allow themselves to be victimized and turned into cannon\r\nfodder. Some still do not get an education. Indeed, there are\r\nmany children around the world who do not enjoy a\r\nchildhood. I am happy that the United Nations has declared\r\nthe decade beginning 2001 to be the International Decade\r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children\r\nof the World. The new millennium belongs to our children.\r\nIt belongs to our children in Saint Kitts and Nevis and to\r\nthe children of the world. We have a duty to help make, for\r\nthem and with them, a better world than the one in which\r\nwe now live.\r\nAdditionally, I have noted that the agenda for this\r\nfifty-fourth session includes an item entitled “Building a\r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic\r\nideal”. Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to place on record its\r\ncountry\u0027s support for that item, as we are doing everything\r\nin our power to build the development of our youth through\r\nsports.\r\nBy the same token, I am proud to report that our\r\neducational policies are yielding very positive results. We\r\nin Saint Kitts and Nevis have achieved a 98 per cent\r\nliteracy rate and we have not only begun, but are\r\nintensifying the process of making all of our young people\r\ncomputer-literate and equipped to face the challenges of the\r\nnew dawning century. Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the\r\nassistance of the international community to enable us to\r\nrealize our objectives in this regard and to give this\r\nprogramme even greater forward thrust.\r\nIt is our view that the technological advancement of\r\nthe past 54 years, instead of creating dislocations, should be\r\nused to improve understanding. It should be used to\r\nimprove efficiency of production and to provide better\r\nrevenue allocation and better living standards. Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis urges those countries with the wherewithal to\r\ndemonstrate appropriate leadership. I encourage them to\r\nuse the availability of and their access to these\r\ntechnologies not only to generate greater economic wealth\r\nfor themselves, but also to advance the economic and\r\nsocial well-being of the citizens of the world.\r\nWe applaud the progress being made with regard to\r\nwomen in development since the adoption of the Beijing\r\nDeclaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women on 15 September 1995. Our\r\ncountry has demonstrated its unswerving commitment to\r\ngender equity by our participation in the Committee on\r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW). For its part,\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is currently implementing a new\r\ngender management system and is introducing measures\r\nto ensure that the national budget in my country is more\r\nsensitive to gender issues. We are grateful to the\r\nCommonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation for\r\ntechnical assistance in this regard.\r\nIn a few days, the United Nations will convene a\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly for the review\r\nand appraisal of the implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action for the small island developing\r\nStates. We trust that the international community will give\r\ndue recognition to the efforts being made by small island\r\nStates to implement their commitments under the\r\nProgramme of Action and note that those efforts have\r\nbeen affected by financial and other resource constraints\r\nand by global, economic and environmental factors. We\r\nlook forward, therefore, to the international community\u0027s\r\nproviding continued support for capacity- and institution-\r\nbuilding programmes and projects in the small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nIn the meantime, my Government welcomes the\r\ncontinued efforts of the Alliance of Small Island States\r\n(AOSIS) in promoting the interests and concerns of small\r\nisland States. All small island developing States, like\r\nthose of us in the Caribbean, are susceptible to the\r\nvagaries of nature as well as to man-made difficulties.\r\nJust last week our brothers and sisters in the Bahamas,\r\nlike those along the south-eastern coastal states of the\r\nUnited States of America, suffered terrible and destructive\r\nlosses as a result of hurricane Floyd. I urge States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to be generous in their\r\nsupport for any reconstruction endeavours for the\r\nthousands of displaced people.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nLast year Saint Kitts and Nevis suffered a similar\r\nmajor blow, from hurricane Georges. The Assembly\r\nexpressed its support for the efforts of my Government, and\r\nseveral other governments in the region, as we coped with\r\nthat particular disaster. The Assembly also urged all States\r\nas a matter of urgency to contribute generously to the relief,\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. It further requested\r\nthe Secretary-General, in collaboration with the\r\ninternational financial institutions and other bodies and\r\nagencies of the United Nations system, to assist the affected\r\nGovernments in identifying their medium- and long-term\r\nneeds and in mobilizing resources, as well as helping with\r\nthe task of rehabilitation and reconstruction in the affected\r\nCaribbean countries.\r\nI have dealt with this at some length because Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis wishes to thank the Assembly for the\r\nsupport expressed in that decision. We hereby place on\r\nrecord that we have received assistance from the United\r\nNations system and, in particular, from the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), and I assure the\r\nrepresentatives in this world body that our efforts at\r\nrehabilitation have proceeded with what some have\r\ndescribed as remarkable speed. But, however commendable\r\nemergency assistance is, it is not a formula for long-term,\r\nsustainable development. Countries such as ours need the\r\ncontinued support of the international community to ensure\r\nthat our development is not sacrificed on the altar of\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization.\r\nHow will the banana farmers in Saint Lucia, Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines, and Dominica, or the sugar-\r\ncane workers in Saint Kitts and Nevis preserve the integrity\r\nof their families? How will they preserve the dignity of a\r\ngood standard of living when the impersonal tentacles of\r\nglobalization reach out to deprive them of the resources\r\nthey need to survive? Human rights, in their purest and\r\nmost practical sense, embody the human condition in all its\r\nbasic elements. Therefore, the United Nations, as a major\r\nguarantor of these rights, should act as a counterbalance to\r\nglobalization, which has begun to take food away from our\r\npeople instead of helping them.\r\nThe World Trade Organization is expected to play a\r\nkey role in promoting trade liberalization, thereby fuelling\r\nthe globalization process. The World Trade Organization,\r\nhowever, is not a panacea for the ills of world trade. No\r\nnew rules can alter the fact that in most areas of exports,\r\ndeveloped countries will have a comparative advantage over\r\ndeveloping countries. It is a basic principle in economics\r\nthat a country with a comparative advantage in producing\r\ngoods and services in given areas will always make money\r\nat the expense of countries that are less equipped. In\r\nshort, the rules as now written will inevitably lead to a\r\nzero-sum situation where trade between developed\r\ncountries and developing countries is concerned.\r\nA regime, therefore, of unrestricted trade can lead to\r\ntremendous shocks in the economy of the less developed\r\ncountries with very critical repercussions for their\r\ncitizens. As part of the Caribbean Community, we have\r\nalready witnessed how the logic of applying the same\r\nrules to all, regardless of the level of economic\r\ndevelopment, has led to serious dislocation within the\r\nbanana-producing countries of our Caribbean subregion.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would prefer to see this body,\r\nthrough the United Nations Conference on Trade on\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), take up the issue of what\r\nhappens to countries caught in the toils of a free-trade\r\nregime. Saint Kitts and Nevis believes that this matter\r\nrequires careful study by experts with a global perspective\r\nand it is our view that the United Nations is the one\r\nOrganization capable of studying this issue objectively\r\nand putting recommendations before the leaders of the\r\nworld to remedy what could potentially be a disaster for\r\nsmall, vulnerable economies.\r\nBy and large, a country such as Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis, which depends upon a buoyant tourist sector, the\r\nexport of sugar and the provision of financial services\r\ncannot — I repeat, cannot — object in principle to a\r\nworld of open economies. But our position is that a world\r\neconomic order predicated upon open economies works\r\nbest with countries whose economies are roughly equal.\r\nIf we are committed to eradicating poverty in every area\r\nof this world, then we must address the implications for\r\npoverty that are inherent in trading arrangements.\r\nThose of us who live in the Caribbean, mostly in\r\ndeveloping countries and small island States, are\r\nvulnerable and also affected by, inter alia, lack of\r\ncapacity and human resource bases, the need for financial\r\nresources, social problems, high levels of poverty and the\r\neffects of globalization. We rely heavily on the coastal\r\nareas, as well as the marine environment in general, to\r\nachieve sustainable development, and meet our needs and\r\ngoals. For us, in the context of sustainable development,\r\nthe Caribbean Sea must be seen as a special area. Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis earnestly expects that Member States, the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations system\r\nwill actively support our efforts in order to develop and\r\nimplement this concept and take action so as to avert the\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nthreat of pollution from ship-generated waste, as well as\r\naccidental release of hazardous and noxious substances.\r\nDespite the socio-economic quagmire that bedevils and\r\nundermines our efforts, my Government has remained\r\nsteadfast. It has remained committed to create more\r\nopportunities for the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis. But\r\nwe are aware that the Government cannot solve these\r\nproblems alone. There is a critical role for the private sector\r\nas well. My Government is equally committed to working\r\nwith local and international businesses, without, however,\r\nsurrendering the fate of our nation to disinterested forces\r\nthat could wreak further havoc on their lives.\r\nMy Government repeats its call for an expansion of\r\nthe interpretation of human rights to incorporate fully\r\neconomic rights and the right to development. In\r\nrecognizing that there is an inseparable link between the\r\nhuman rights and economic rights of the individual, my\r\nGovernment has pledged to continue our programme to\r\nbuild affordable houses, create jobs, fight poverty and\r\npursue new sources of local and foreign investment. My\r\nGovernment will be an avid partner and facilitator of\r\nbusiness without compromising the quality of life for each\r\nof our citizens.\r\nThere is an important part for national Governments\r\nto play in the protection of their citizens’ human rights, but\r\nthere is a more substantial, comprehensive and far-reaching\r\nrole for the United Nations as ultimate protector of the\r\nentire body of human rights.\r\nThis means that there should be a greater partnership\r\nbetween the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations human\r\nrights mechanisms and other agencies and organs. In this\r\nway, new strategies can be devised for opening access to\r\nmarkets for those countries that continue to find themselves\r\non the periphery of the international trading system. The\r\nOrganization should help to create and investigate practical\r\nalternatives.\r\nHence, I maintain that we need a United Nations that\r\nis informed by the inequities of the world economic\r\nsystems, and is able to respond to the social challenges that\r\nare being exacerbated as a result.\r\nWe do our best to achieve the eradication of poverty.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis seeks the support of the international\r\ncommunity, thus building a bridge to a better world.\r\nTomorrow’s world should open with our people finding\r\nanswers to the request to give them each day their daily\r\nbread, and the kingdom of peace should be realized here\r\non Earth. There is an urgency to match our deeds with\r\nour words so that we may, all of us, find the forgiveness\r\nwhich is necessary as the basis for building peace in this\r\nworld.\r\nLast year I spoke of the viability of social-venture\r\nphilanthropy through which Governments and businesses\r\nmay collaborate with each other. This concept already\r\nexists at a similar level within many corporate structures.\r\nCompanies are already engaged in projects that enhance\r\nand maintain a positive corporate image. We would take\r\nthis further if companies would recognize the importance\r\nof preserving a good corporate culture by improving the\r\nstandard of living of the national constituencies in which\r\nthey do profitable business. A reformed United Nations,\r\nwith its existing organs, funds and programmes, can help\r\nto implement such strategies.\r\nWe must move with informed haste, because I fear\r\nthat if we fail to translate the benefits of democracy,\r\ntechnological growth and economic wealth into tangible\r\ngains for our people, future chaos will not be far behind.\r\nI am one of those who refuse to accept that the developed\r\nworld could be ignorant of the challenges facing the small\r\nand poor economies. I am reluctant to think that national\r\ninterests could be so blinding that Governments neglect to\r\nrealize that the problems plaguing any one region, for\r\ninstance, have serious ramifications much further afield.\r\nWe have to recommit to the elimination of the\r\npotent cancer of illicit drugs and global consequences. We\r\nare all victims. Therefore, we must all become partners.\r\nLet us commit to root out the menace of narco-trafficking\r\nthat is becoming embedded in our various societies.\r\nI dare say that the multitude of problems before us\r\nis complex and very involved. The old paradigms that\r\nprevailed in the cold war have outlived their usefulness.\r\nIt is not only those elements that directly threaten our\r\npolitical and strategic interests, but also those factors that\r\nundermine a country’s ability to preserve its economic,\r\nsocial and cultural fabric that should guide national\r\ninterests. There is no longer one giant enemy, but there\r\nare a number of persistent factors that could conspire at\r\nany one time to destroy the delicate balance of our\r\nsocieties.\r\nIn spite of all the shortcomings of this body, if the\r\nUnited Nations did not exist, it would be necessary to\r\ninvent it, because there is no other organization that has\r\ncontributed as much to the development of humankind.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nMoreover, the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nis happy to be given this opportunity to express its views\r\non a number of issues of concern to my country.\r\nWithout the United Nations, a micro State such as\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would never have been heard.\r\nTherefore, as we cross over into the new millennium, Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis joins with the rest of the world as we\r\ncommit ourselves to the continued development of the\r\nUnited Nations in order to ensure that all people\r\neverywhere will enjoy the fulfilment of the promise of\r\npeace, prosperity and progress.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of\r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister\r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister of\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Sartaj Aziz, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Aziz (Pakistan): Mr.President, it is an honour to\r\naddress the General Assembly at this session, the last to be\r\nheld in the twentieth century.\r\nMay I begin by welcoming the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the\r\nfamily of the United Nations. We look forward to working\r\nclosely with the new Members.\r\nThe twentieth century has been described as the age of\r\nextremes. In this century, human civilization made quantum\r\nstrides in progress and prosperity. We discovered the ocean\r\ndepths, travelled into the outer space and landed on the\r\nmoon. We have witnessed the technological and\r\ninformation revolutions transforming the wide world into a\r\nglobal village.\r\nThe twentieth century has also been a violent and\r\ntragic century. Millions died in the two world wars and\r\nhundreds of other conflicts. Millions perished as a result\r\nof poverty and disease.\r\nThis session of the Assembly offers an opportunity\r\nto identify the major global challenges which humankind\r\nis likely to confront in the next century. The United\r\nNations should therefore devote the next year to evolving\r\nways and means to address these challenges and to\r\npromoting an agreed approach next year at the\r\nMillennium Assembly.\r\nPeace remains the foremost challenge of our times.\r\nThe end of the cold war and the triumph of the principles\r\nof democracy and free markets created hope for the dawn\r\nof universal peace. This, unfortunately, turned out to be\r\nelusive. Instead, conflicts have continued to ravage the\r\nworld.\r\nLong-suppressed national aspirations, as well as\r\nfrustration with continuing inequity and deprivation, have\r\nled to widespread violence and wars, between and within\r\nStates. The several conflicts afflicting Africa, the Balkans\r\nand the Caucasus, as well as Palestine, Kashmir and\r\nAfghanistan, are painful reminders of the ascendance of\r\nwar and the absence of peace.\r\nThe United Nations, under the wise leadership of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, has endeavoured to cope\r\nwith these conflicts and crises. Unilateral approaches,\r\naccompanying the centralization of global influence, have\r\nnot always ensured just and durable solutions to complex\r\nproblems rooted in history, religion, politics and\r\neconomics in various parts of the world.\r\nIn the final and decisive confrontation of the cold\r\nwar, 1.5 million Afghans were killed, a million were\r\nmaimed, and a whole country was destroyed. Ten years\r\nafter the foreign intervention ended, almost 3 million\r\nAfghan refugees are still in Pakistan and Iran. With no\r\nreconstruction and no development in that poor country,\r\nthe new generation knows nothing but war. Rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction are the right of the valiant Afghan\r\npeople. Economic development, accompanied by\r\neducation and modernization, is the best way to end\r\nviolence, promote human rights and improve social\r\nconditions in Afghanistan.\r\nPeace in Afghanistan is vital for Pakistan. Turmoil\r\nin Afghanistan creates turbulence on our frontier. The\r\npreservation of Afghanistan’s territorial integrity is pivotal\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nfor peace and stability throughout Central Asia. Peace in\r\nAfghanistan will open vast opportunities for commerce and\r\neconomic interaction between Central Asia and South Asia\r\nand beyond.\r\nPakistan has persisted in promoting peace and\r\nreconciliation in Afghanistan. We support the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations as well as the “six plus two” process.\r\nPakistan is constantly endeavouring to bring about an end\r\nto the fighting and promote reconciliation and political\r\naccommodation between the Taliban Government and the\r\nNorthern Alliance.\r\nThe world has welcomed the resumption of the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East. We earnestly hope that it will\r\nproceed smoothly to culminate in the establishment of a just\r\nand durable peace based on the fundamental rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, including their right to their own State,\r\nand the withdrawal of Israel from the Syrian Golan Heights\r\nand southern Lebanon.\r\nWe are glad that the tension between morality and\r\nlegality has been overcome in Kosovo. We are happy the\r\nKosovar refugees have returned home. Yet Kosovo’s\r\ntravails are not over. Pakistan will continue to support the\r\nefforts of the United Nations for peace in the Balkans.\r\nIn East Timor, we trust that the human tragedy has\r\nended, even as the United Nations peacekeepers arrive\r\nthere. I wish to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan and my compatriot, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker,\r\nwho were greatly challenged in the process of fostering\r\nfreedom in East Timor while safeguarding stability.\r\nWe have learned valuable lessons from Kosovo and\r\nEast Timor: a people’s aspiration for freedom cannot be\r\nsuppressed indefinitely; a free exercise of the right of\r\nself-determination is indispensable for peace; self-\r\ndetermination can be best exercised in an environment free\r\nof fear and coercion; and the United Nations is best placed\r\nto oversee the exercise of self-determination.\r\nThese conclusions were already accepted for Kashmir\r\n50 years ago. The Security Council decided that the final\r\ndisposition of the disputed State of Kashmir should be\r\ndetermined by its people, in a free and impartial plebiscite\r\nheld under United Nations auspices. India resiled from its\r\nacceptance of this agreement and from its own pledge to\r\nallow the Kashmiri people to decide their own future. On\r\none pretext or another, it refused to implement the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolutions.\r\nIndia\u0027s repression in Jammu and Kashmir has killed\r\nthousands of Kashmiris, forced hundreds of thousands\r\ninto exile, led to three wars between Pakistan and India\r\nand consigned the two countries to a relationship of\r\nendemic conflict and mistrust. Pakistan and India can and\r\nmust overcome this unfortunate legacy.\r\nTo this end, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, soon after\r\nassuming office two and a half years ago, proposed the\r\ninitiation of a comprehensive, structured and sustained\r\ndialogue between Pakistan and India to address Kashmir,\r\npeace and security and other outstanding issues. India\r\nagreed, after one year, to a dialogue on Kashmir. To\r\nprovide political momentum to the bilateral dialogue,\r\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif invited Prime Minister\r\nVajpayee to visit Pakistan.\r\nAt the Lahore summit, India and Pakistan committed\r\nthemselves to intensify their efforts to resolve Kashmir,\r\nbuild mutual confidence and peace and pave the way for\r\nbroader cooperation. In Lahore, the Pakistan Prime\r\nMinister urged his Indian counterpart to ease the\r\nrepression in Kashmir. He cautioned that without progress\r\non Kashmir political dynamics could compromise the\r\ngood intentions reflected in the Lahore Declaration. But\r\nIndia displayed no desire to genuinely address, let alone\r\nresolve, the Kashmir issue. Its cruel repression of the\r\nKashmiri people continued unabated.\r\nThe Kargil crisis was a manifestation of the deeper\r\nmalaise spawned by the unresolved Kashmir problem and\r\nIndia\u0027s escalating repression of the Kashmiri people. India\r\nlaunched a massive military operation in Kargil and\r\nthreatened a wider conflict by mobilizing its armed forces\r\nall along the Pakistan-India international border. Pakistan\r\nacted with restraint. We believed that war between two\r\nnuclear-armed neighbours must be avoided. We offered\r\nimmediate de-escalation and negotiations to address\r\nproblems along the Line of Control, including India\u0027s\r\nviolation of this Line and occupation of Chorbatla,\r\nSiachen and Qamar. Pakistan\u0027s efforts led to the\r\ndisengagement by the Kashmiri freedom fighters from the\r\nKargil heights and offered a renewed opportunity for\r\nnegotiation and dialogue.\r\nPakistan is ready for the resumption of the Lahore\r\nprocess with India. However, instead of reciprocating\r\nPakistan\u0027s willingness to pursue negotiations, India has\r\nposed preconditions for resuming the talks. The Indian\r\nmilitary deliberately shot down an unarmed Pakistan\r\nnaval aircraft on a routine flight within our airspace,\r\nkilling 16 of our naval personnel — mostly young\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\ntrainees — in cold blood and without any warning. India is\r\nalso continuing hostilities along the Line of Control and has\r\nrepeatedly launched attacks across the Line in several\r\nsectors.\r\nKashmir is not a dispute over land. It is about the\r\ndestiny of a people; it is about implementation of the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council; it is about respect for\r\nthe fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, especially\r\ntheir right to self-determination. The complete boycott by\r\nthe Kashmiris of the sham elections in Kashmir organized\r\nby India earlier this month is clear testimony of their total\r\nalienation from India. No settlement can be durable if it is\r\ncontrary to their wishes.\r\nThe Kashmir issue cannot be frozen while its people\r\nare determined to secure their freedom; while the blood of\r\nKashmiri martyrs is being shed by the bullets and bayonets\r\nof the 700,000-strong Indian occupation force. Human\r\nrights must be upheld not only in Kosovo and Timor, but\r\nalso in Kashmir. To make progress towards a settlement,\r\nthe world must demand that India take immediate steps to\r\nhalt its repression of the Kashmiri people.\r\nFor this purpose, India must: first, stop the cruel\r\ncrackdowns against Kashmiri villages and urban areas;\r\nsecond, release the thousands of Kashmiris held in\r\ndetention centres and jails; third, remove military pickets\r\nand troops stationed in Kashmiri towns and villages; fourth,\r\nallow the presence of international human rights\r\norganizations in Kashmir; fifth, agree to the stationing of\r\nimpartial human rights monitors in Jammu and Kashmir;\r\nsixth, entrust the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\n(ICRC) with a larger role in Kashmir, including the\r\nprovision of relief and help to the thousands of Kashmiri\r\nwidows and orphans; and, seventh, agree to a progressive\r\nreduction of the 700,000 Indian troops deployed in\r\nKashmir.\r\nThe international community is increasingly conscious\r\nof the imperative for a just resolution of the Jammu and\r\nKashmir dispute. The risk of a wider conflict cannot be\r\ncontemplated in a nuclear environment. Kashmir remains on\r\nthe Security Council\u0027s agenda. The Council\u0027s resolutions\r\nremain to be implemented. The promise of self-\r\ndetermination made by the United Nations to the Kashmiri\r\npeople remains to be fulfilled. Therefore, while we will,\r\nhopefully, soon resume bilateral talks with India, Pakistan\r\nwould welcome the association of the genuine\r\nrepresentatives of the Kashmiri people with the negotiating\r\nprocess to promote a solution consistent with the United\r\nNations Security Council resolutions.\r\nIndia\u0027s ambitions threaten to further propel our\r\nregion towards a dangerous nuclear and conventional\r\narms race. For decades — even after India\u0027s first nuclear\r\nexplosion in 1974 — Pakistan sought to exclude nuclear\r\nweapons from South Asia. Ironically, the advocates of\r\nnon-proliferation imposed discriminatory restrictions\r\nagainst Pakistan while ignoring India\u0027s steady\r\ndevelopment of nuclear and missile capabilities. Last May\r\nIndia put the final nail in the coffin of South Asian non-\r\nproliferation when it conducted five nuclear tests and\r\ndeclared itself a nuclear-weapon State. Its leaders then\r\nproceeded to threaten Pakistan. Confronted by an\r\naggressive nuclear India, Pakistan was obliged to\r\ndemonstrate its nuclear capability and thus restore nuclear\r\ndeterrence and strategic balance in South Asia. The\r\nresponse of the major Powers, to penalize not only the\r\noffender but also the victim, was patently unfair.\r\nEven after our tests, Pakistan proposed nuclear\r\nrestraint to India, consistent with our conviction that\r\nnuclear deterrence can and should be maintained between\r\nPakistan and India at the lowest possible level. In our\r\nseparate dialogues with the United States and India, we\r\nproposed a strategic restraint regime outlining specific\r\nmeasures for nuclear restraint and stabilization,\r\nconventional arms balance and the resolution of\r\noutstanding disputes. Hopes for restraint have been\r\nshattered by the announcement of India\u0027s nuclear doctrine,\r\nsetting out plans to acquire and operationally deploy a\r\nhuge arsenal of land-, air- and sea-based nuclear weapons\r\nand to further build up its conventional forces, almost all\r\nof which are deployed against Pakistan. Even the Indian\r\noffer of non-first use of nuclear weapons is designed to\r\ngain it acceptance as a nuclear-weapon State and to\r\njustify the acquisition of a massive nuclear arsenal as a\r\nsecond-strike capability.\r\nIndia\u0027s pursuit of this doctrine will destabilize South\r\nAsia. Pakistan will be compelled to enhance its nuclear\r\nand missile capabilities and operational readiness to\r\npreserve deterrence. India must test again to develop\r\nwarheads for its missiles. This would subvert the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). India\u0027s\r\nquest for its large nuclear arsenal could jeopardize\r\nprospects for the conclusion of a fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty. India\u0027s ambitions threaten peace and stability not\r\nonly in South Asia, but also in adjacent regions, including\r\nthe Gulf and the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean.\r\nThe international community must act — and it must\r\nact immediately — if it is to avoid a hair-trigger security\r\nenvironment in South Asia, with grave implications for\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nglobal peace, security and disarmament. To this end, the\r\nAssembly should endorse the concept of strategic restraint\r\nin South Asia.\r\nFor this purpose, it should urge India to do the\r\nfollowing.\r\nFirst, India should disavow the proposed nuclear\r\ndoctrine. Secondly, it should refrain from any further\r\nnuclear tests and adhere to the CTBT. For its part, Pakistan\r\nremains committed to adhering to the CTBT in an\r\natmosphere free of coercion. Thirdly, it should undertake\r\nnot to operationally deploy nuclear weapons on land, air or\r\nsea. Fourthly, it should open negotiations with Pakistan for\r\nan agreement to achieve balance in fissile material stocks,\r\nwhile both India and Pakistan participate in the fissile\r\nmaterial treaty negotiations, expected to commence early\r\nnext year in Geneva. Fifthly, India should eschew the\r\nacquisition of anti-ballistic missile systems and any\r\nmilitary-related capabilities in space; and sixthly, cut back\r\ndrastically on its plans to purchase and develop various\r\nadvanced and destabilizing conventional weapons systems.\r\nIn this context, Pakistan appeals to those countries which\r\nintend to supply these conventional weapons to India to\r\nreconsider their policies.\r\nPakistan believes that it is now essential to convene a\r\nconference, with the participation of all the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council and other interested\r\nPowers, as well as Pakistan and India, to promote the goals\r\nof strategic restraint and stability in South Asia.\r\nThe threat of nuclear war does not emanate only from\r\nSouth Asia. Although the strategic confrontation of the cold\r\nwar is over, the major nuclear Powers, even while pressing\r\nfor non-proliferation by others, have asserted their own\r\nright to possess nuclear weapons indefinitely. The\r\nimplementation of strategic arms reduction agreements is\r\nstalled. If the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty is\r\nrescinded or revised, and missile defence plans are\r\nimplemented, the nuclear-arms race may well be revived\r\namong the nuclear-weapon States. And heightened tensions\r\namong them, over new or old disputes, could once again\r\nmove the nuclear doomsday clock closer to midnight.\r\nPakistan supports the endeavours to achieve nuclear\r\ndisarmament and the early elimination of all nuclear\r\nweapons. Multilateral negotiations can evolve agreed plans\r\nto realize these vital objectives. We also support the call for\r\npreserving the ABM Treaty and avoiding the development\r\nand deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems.\r\nNegotiations to prevent the further militarization of outer\r\nspace should be initiated forthwith in the Geneva\r\nConference on Disarmament.\r\nIn a globalized yet divided world, with modern\r\nweaponry and communications available to almost\r\neveryone, terrorism has emerged as a pervasive challenge\r\nin many parts of the world. It is a complex phenomenon\r\nwith many manifestations, a lethal tool used by ruthless\r\nindividuals, groups and States.\r\nPakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, wherever it occurs. For a decade, during\r\nthe Afghan war, Pakistan was the single largest target of\r\nterrorism from across our borders. Even today, our\r\nadversaries foment fear in Pakistani cities by sponsoring\r\nand financing terrorist bomb blasts and random violence.\r\nOur eastern neighbour has mastered the black art of state\r\nterrorism in Kashmir, utilizing the tactics of crack-downs,\r\ncustodial killings, disappearances, arson, torture and rape,\r\nas tools of repression against the Kashmiri people\u0027s\r\nstruggle for freedom and self-determination. It is with\r\ngood reason that the non-aligned countries have\r\ndenounced the repression of peoples under foreign\r\noccupation as the worst form of terrorism.\r\nPakistan condemns the reprehensible tendency in\r\ncertain quarters to link manifestations of terrorism with\r\nIslam. We welcome the resolution adopted earlier this\r\nyear by the Commission on Human Rights which\r\ndenounced attempts, including in the media, to defame\r\nIslam and link it with terrorism.\r\nFree markets and free political systems, accompanied\r\nby breath-taking technological advances, are rapidly\r\nintegrating our world across frontiers and continents.\r\nUnfortunately, most developing countries have been\r\nbypassed by the benefits of globalization. Income\r\ninequality has increased among and within countries. And,\r\nas the Asian financial crisis showed, growth has often\r\nbeen fragile.\r\nMarket forces alone will not yield an equitable\r\neconomic outcome for all peoples. At the tenth United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD X) and other international conferences, we\r\nneed to rethink current development strategies and\r\nformulate new approaches for broad-based development,\r\nguided by the need for economic equity for individuals\r\nand nations.\r\nAction is required in three main areas. First, in the\r\narea of trade, we need a truly level playing field to\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nencourage greater balance in the benefits of a rules-based\r\nmultilateral trading system for the developing countries.\r\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\r\nConference in Seattle can advance this goal by resolving\r\nproblems involved in the implementation of the Uruguay\r\nRound agreements on textiles and agriculture and\r\naddressing priority issues for developing countries in future\r\nnegotiations — not by insisting on premature liberalization\r\nin sectors where they are unable to compete. In Seattle, we\r\nmust also oppose the forces of protectionism disguised as\r\nmovements to promote environmental and social standards.\r\nSecondly, in the financial area, we need a more stable\r\nfinancial order which can control the volatility of capital\r\nflows, make available adequate liquidity, especially for the\r\ndeveloping countries, alleviate their debt burden, and ensure\r\ncoherence between global financial and trade policies. The\r\nhigh level “event” on financing for development could help\r\nto build agreement on these issues.\r\nThirdly, technology: in an increasingly knowledge-\r\nbased global economy, the technology and knowledge gap\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries must be\r\nrapidly narrowed. To this end, it would be useful to evolve\r\nglobal principles and guidelines for access to and transfer\r\nof technology.\r\nIn our globalizing yet fractured world, marked by stark\r\ncontrasts between prosperity and poverty, between\r\ntranquillity and turbulence, the hopes of hundreds of\r\nmillions of people lie in the United Nations, the most\r\nuniversal global institution. The United Nations must play\r\nits role, as prescribed in the Charter, as the centre for the\r\nharmonization of the policies of Member States and as the\r\ncentral instrument for collective security. The Security\r\nCouncil\u0027s procedures must be made more transparent and\r\ndemocratic, to reflect the collective will and views of all\r\nStates Members of the United Nations.\r\nThe Assembly must also agree on the objectives and\r\nprinciples and the approaches and instruments which will\r\nenable the international community to respond to the\r\nemerging challenges posed by conflicts, arms proliferation\r\nand unequal globalization. It is here, at the United Nations,\r\nthat we must seek consistent respect for the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter, and respect for its\r\nbinding decisions. Only thus can we realize the vision of\r\npeace and prosperity for all peoples in a global environment\r\nof freedom and democracy.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call\r\non the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece,\r\nMr. George Papandreou.\r\nMr. Papandreou (Greece): I should like to express\r\nmy most sincere congratulations to Mr. Gurirab on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at this\r\nsession. It is significant that his country, which gained\r\nindependence as a result of the struggle of its people and\r\nthe successful efforts of this Organization, will be\r\npresiding today over this Assembly and will, I am certain,\r\nbring its work to a successful conclusion. I extend my\r\ncongratulations to his predecessor for the commitment\r\nwith which he conducted his duties. I express our\r\nwarmest support to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his tireless efforts. He has used his competent\r\npolitical skill, his moral authority and his deep knowledge\r\nof the opportunities and limitations of his office to pursue\r\ndaunting tasks, often working against all odds.\r\nMy Government fully subscribes to the statement\r\ndelivered by Ms. Halonen, the Foreign Minister of\r\nFinland, on behalf of the European Union, and to the\r\nmemorandum circulated by the Union.\r\nGlobalization in the field of information, ideas, the\r\neconomy, democracy and human rights has been the\r\ndominant feature of the last years of our century. Some\r\npeople fear it; some try to ignore it; a few try to fight it;\r\nothers try to avoid it. Many welcome it as a creative\r\nchallenge. We Greeks are among the last category: we\r\nthrive on openness, freedom of exchange, freedom of\r\nthought, expression and inquiry. We speak the language\r\nof dialogue, the language of ideas. That is our tradition.\r\nWe are proud of that tradition which sparked off the\r\nRenaissance and supported the Enlightenment, whose\r\nessence was captured by Immanuel Kant\u0027s motto sapere\r\naude: dare to think. Globalization challenges us to dare to\r\nthink the unthinkable in terms of sovereignty,\r\ninternational relations and human rights. But that is not\r\nenough: we know we must go beyond it; we must dare to\r\nstate a vision for our world; we must dare to hope.\r\nWe take heart that at the end of our century\r\ndemocracy is being celebrated as the universal system of\r\npolitical rule, the only secure basis for legitimacy in the\r\nmodern world. Experience teaches us that democracy not\r\nonly institutionalizes freedom but also brings prosperity.\r\nCelebrated economist Amartya Sen has conclusively\r\nproved that a democratic system of Government is no\r\nobstacle to the creation of wealth: development does not\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nrequire an authoritarian ruler. Sen has observed that no\r\nsubstantial famine has ever occurred in any country with a\r\ndemocratic form of government and a relatively free press.\r\nWe take heart from the fact that more States claim to\r\nbe democratic now than ever before in human history, and\r\nwe are firmly committed to seeing this trend expand.\r\nSlowly but surely, we are observing the globalization of\r\ndemocracy, and we dare to hope.\r\nNevertheless, our challenges and political dilemmas\r\nare formidable. We need to globalize peace. We watch in\r\nawe as Israelis and Palestinians shake hands once again.\r\nThe peace might be local, but our pride is international.\r\nEqually, when watching India and Pakistan, we dare to\r\nhope for non-proliferation. We cringe as pictures of war\r\ncome out of Africa. We cannot hope for peace yet shut our\r\neyes to war.\r\nWe need to globalize human rights. Do we apply the\r\nsame standards everywhere, from Kosovo and East Timor\r\nto Cyprus and Rwanda? We need to globalize our concept\r\nof rights pertaining to human beings. We understand\r\nmultinationals that support human rights to protect their\r\ninvestments, but who will protect individuals who seek\r\nprotection from the indignities of the world market?\r\nWe need to globalize ethics. From Kosovo to East\r\nTimor we have bowed our heads, for we are still ill-\r\nequipped to deal with global ethical dilemmas such as those\r\nmentioned by the Secretary-General. Can human suffering\r\nbe subordinated to sovereignty? Can we afford to be\r\ninconsistent in the application of military intervention? Is it\r\nright to impose trade sanctions on Governments that violate\r\ninternational rules, at the expense of their innocent\r\npopulations?\r\nWe seek to globalize values. Technological innovation\r\nis calling into question some of our most deeply felt beliefs.\r\nFrom cloning to brain transplants, scientists now face\r\ndilemmas that have global implications. We must make sure\r\nthat fear does not inhibit scientific development, but also\r\nthat curiosity does not inhibit civility.\r\nWe need to globalize wealth. The growing gap\r\nbetween rich and poor countries has marginalized a large\r\nsegment of the world\u0027s population and led to dangerous\r\nsocial problems, from illegal immigration to drug\r\ntrafficking, terrorism, child labour and sexual exploitation.\r\nIn an effort to contribute what little we can, Greece decided\r\nto increase its official development assistance by an annual\r\naverage of 27 per cent over a five-year plan, targeting in\r\nparticular sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nHow can we hope to face these challenges if the\r\npeople of this world do not share a basic education and\r\ndo not enjoy basic health? While the electronic media\r\nhave minimized the restrictions of borders in the transfer\r\nof resources, wealth and information, democratic\r\ninstitutions and social policies remain confined within the\r\nborders of nations. We cannot wait for democracy to\r\nspread at this pace: we need a faster cure. We need to\r\nconfront this global democratic deficit by supporting\r\nglobal democratic institutions.\r\nBeyond the globalization of democracy, I call for the\r\ndemocratization of globalism. This is a vision worthy of\r\nthe United Nations. We seek a United Nations that is an\r\nactive centre for peace and justice, a centre for the\r\nimprovement of the life of each individual on this Earth.\r\nWe expect a United Nations to respond to our needs for\r\nglobal ethics and global values. We believe in a strong\r\nUnited Nations that will act swiftly and effectively against\r\nthose who wage war, harbour terrorism and destroy our\r\nplanet. We aspire to a United Nations which will become\r\nthe centre for democratic thinking and democratic practice\r\nthroughout our world.\r\nMay these United Nations, on our behalf, develop a\r\nculture of dialogue and a dialogue of cultures. For this is\r\nthe essence of democratic politics: not a clash of different\r\ncivilizations, but an educative dialogue that allows all to\r\ntake part. We must educate each other to find peaceful\r\nand democratic ways to confront our challenges.\r\nThis is a task for the United Nations. We yield to its\r\nauthority as the only forum able to democratize the\r\nglobalization process. We call for all Member States to\r\nprovide the United Nations with the authority and the\r\nmeans to perform its duties. Greece will do so. As our\r\nGhanaian colleague said yesterday, we continue to ask\r\nmore of the United Nations, and yet we continue to\r\nendow it with fewer resources. We feel that following the\r\nimportant reforms of the Secretariat, the time has come to\r\nexpand this Organization\u0027s authority, responsibility and\r\nbudget. Do we dare allow this Organization to hope? In\r\nGreece we do.\r\nMy country believes in strengthening the United\r\nNations, but it also believes in doing its own work, on the\r\nground, in the region. Uri Savir, the Israeli negotiator in\r\nOslo, has said that peacemaking is a gradual revolution\r\nthat moves from hostility to a desired conciliation, a\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\ncollection of moments in which a new trend is set in\r\nmotion.\r\nTogether with the International Olympic Committee,\r\nGreece has proposed the creation of such a moment — a\r\nglobal moment: we would like to see the revival of the\r\nancient Greek tradition of the Olympic truce. We hope that\r\nthis Assembly, which has unanimously endorsed that\r\nproject, will give its full support to the observance of the\r\nOlympic truce during the games of the year 2000 in\r\nSydney, Australia, in Athens in 2004 and at all future\r\nOlympics, so that the event may become a momentous\r\nfestival of excellence, cross-cultural dialogue and peace in\r\nour global village.\r\nFrom Cyprus to Bosnia, a “collection of moments” is\r\nproviding a ray of hope that, one day, a united Balkans and\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe will belong to a united Europe: a\r\nfamily of nations, a bouquet of cultures, a kaleidoscope of\r\nethnicities, where diversity is our strength and where\r\nborders are so profoundly respected that they cease to exist.\r\nCan we dare see that far? Do we dare not to? We dare to\r\nhope.\r\nTurning first to Cyprus: following the declaration on\r\nCyprus by the leaders of the Group of Eight and Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 1250 (1999) and 1251 (1999) of last\r\nJune, there is hope that a new initiative may break the\r\ndeadlock. Just as we envision a multicultural Balkans, we\r\nare striving to see Cyprus as a federal State with a single\r\nsovereignty and a single citizenship, a united, demilitarized,\r\nindependent country with its territorial integrity safe from\r\nencroachments and with no foreign troops on its soil. The\r\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union would certainly\r\nbenefit both communities living on the island. We invite the\r\nTurkish Cypriots, in the spirit of a newfound friendship\r\nbetween Greeks and Turks, to grab this historical\r\nopportunity. Let us break down the last “Berlin wall”,\r\nwhich artificially divides those two peoples. Let us show\r\nthe world and our children that, yes, we can live together\r\nin peace and harmony with respect for human rights and\r\ndemocratic principles, within a wider European family.\r\nThe tragic events in Kosovo will be remembered for\r\nacts of brutal ethnic cleansing and a military intervention\r\nthat ensued without the authorization of the Security\r\nCouncil. Today, I encounter individuals who, under\r\npressure to “close the case of the Balkans”, opt to redraw\r\nthe maps, believing that ethnic isolation, constructing new\r\nwalls and barriers between our peoples of the region, will\r\nsolve our problems. But it can only compound our\r\nproblems.\r\nI assure the Assembly that there is no short path, no\r\nlazy road if you will, to lasting peace in the Balkans.\r\nConsistent with our policy in our region is our belief that\r\nborders are sacrosanct. But within them we must do our\r\nutmost to protect minorities, democratic procedures and\r\nhuman rights. We must strive to develop the three pillars\r\nof the Stability Pact for South-eastern Europe: democracy,\r\nsecurity and reconstruction. We need to build democratic\r\ninstitutions, judicial and financial systems, competitive\r\nbusiness and free media, things we often take for granted.\r\nWe need to be aggressive in ensuring that all forms of\r\nlikely threat to security within and among our countries\r\nare dealt with directly, openly and with vigour. The\r\nprotection of minorities is of fundamental importance. We\r\nneed, as the Secretary-General has said, a new\r\ncommitment to the prevention of conflict. We need to\r\nprovide basic economic help that will fight against the\r\npoverty and degradation that lead to ethnic and religious\r\nfanaticism.\r\nBut more important, we need a total Balkan\r\napproach. When I say “total”, I mean a coherent and\r\nconsistent approach by the international community. The\r\nBalkans are badly served by mixed signals.\r\nGreece has drawn for itself a creative and effective\r\nrole in the region. Greece supports all efforts to deepen\r\ndemocracy in the region. A total Balkan approach to\r\ndemocracy, security and reconstruction will pave the way\r\nfor our neighbours to enter the European Union.\r\nYugoslavia, of course, is also an integral part of this total\r\nBalkan approach. So too are Greece\u0027s bilateral and\r\ntrilateral contacts of very close cooperation with Albania,\r\nthe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria\r\nand Romania. We worked closely together during the\r\nrecent Kosovo crisis for stability in the region and in\r\nproviding humanitarian aid to Kosovo refugees.\r\nWe believe that in our region there are no good or\r\nbad people, just good and bad practices. We have\r\ndelivered and continue to deliver humanitarian assistance,\r\nas major humanitarian problems remain in many parts of\r\nYugoslavia, and peacekeeping forces. We have conducted\r\nmultilateral diplomacy, and we have promoted every\r\neffort that adheres to principles I have just stated without\r\ndiscrimination. Yes, in the total Balkan approach there is\r\nroom for both the Albanian and the Serbian people. We\r\nask them to dare to have a vision, the same vision: that,\r\none by one, each Balkan country will become part of a\r\nunited democratic Europe.\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nIf the road to peace is indeed made up of a collection\r\nof moments, then I also dare hope for our relations with\r\nTurkey. My Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, and I have\r\nbeen engaged in careful diplomacy for many months. We\r\nrecently inaugurated discussion committees to address a\r\nnumber of bilateral concerns, including trade, tourism, the\r\nenvironment and security, where we feel our two countries\r\nhave much to gain from mutual cooperation.\r\nPeoples\u0027 aspirations for the principles of democracy,\r\nsecurity and prosperity can overcome historical strife. In\r\nthis democratic spirit, we believe that our security is bound\r\nby the stability in the region; that our neighbours\u0027 strength\r\nis our own strength. From the outset, therefore, Greece\r\nshared with Turkey the vision that one day Turkey would\r\nbecome a worthy member of a united Europe. But we\r\nrecognize today that our role needs to be to lead the\r\nprocess.\r\nThe terrible earthquakes that shook both our countries\r\nhave accelerated that process. Spontaneous and dramatic\r\nacts of fraternity and solidarity between our citizens short-\r\ncircuited elaborate diplomatic strategies and exerted\r\npowerful pressure on our Governments to move ahead\r\nboldly. I for one shall never forget the sweat, the tears and\r\nthe genuine expressions of solidarity and friendship shared\r\nby so many non-governmental organizations, and\r\nparticularly by Greek and Turkish rescue workers from the\r\nDisaster Management Special Unit (EMAK) and the\r\nTurkish Search and Rescue Team (AKUT), sifting through\r\nthe rubble of buildings destroyed by the earthquakes,\r\nlooking for survivors. These people did not wait for us to\r\nact. Their actions globalize democracy, human solidarity\r\nand peace.\r\nThat is one more lesson for democracy. International\r\nrelations, humanitarianism, peace and cooperation have\r\nmuch to gain if we allow for citizens\u0027 diplomacy and give\r\nour full support to constructive roles for non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nBuilding on this unique experience, in our first joint\r\nact as members of this Organization, I join hands today\r\nwith my Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem. I join hands with\r\nhim to announce to the Assembly the establishment of a\r\njoint stand-by disaster response unit composed of\r\ncontingents drawn from governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental agencies of both countries, Greece and\r\nTurkey, to reinforce the United Nations capacity in this\r\nfield.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the victims of the recent disastrous\r\nearthquake in Taiwan, and to their families.\r\nA comprehensive and methodical approach to\r\ndealing with natural disasters is in line with the recent\r\nstatement by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, that\r\nsome major risk reduction and disaster prevention\r\nprogrammes require levels of funding that many poor\r\ncountries simply cannot afford.\r\nIn this Assembly, great visions founded on a strong\r\nsense of realism have helped to make the world more\r\ndemocratic, safer, and a little less painful for those in\r\nneed. In Greece and south-east Europe, similar visions are\r\nhelping to build democratic institutions, cement peace and\r\npave the way to prosperity. There simply is no truth in\r\nthe saying that we in the Balkans are trapped, that we\r\nhave produced more history than we can consume and\r\nthat we are prisoners of past conflicts and hatreds. History\r\nis not duress unless one makes it so. The challenge to\r\nevery new generation of Greeks, and the challenge to our\r\nneighbours, is to learn from our history, and not to\r\nbecome slaves to it. We are building a new collective\r\nvision for the region, slowly but surely. We look forward\r\nto the day when Belgrade and Pristina will be an easy bus\r\nride away, when Jerusalem and Damascus, Athens and\r\nAnkara and, of course, the two parts of divided Nicosia,\r\nwill no longer be separated by fear and suspicion, but will\r\nbe joined in peace. Perhaps that day is still far away but,\r\nas a Chinese proverb has it, a journey of a thousand miles\r\nbegins with one small step.\r\nHistory is not compulsion unless one makes it so.\r\nThe challenge to every new generation of Greeks, the\r\nchallenge to our neighbours, is to learn from our history\r\nrather than become slaves to it. We are building a new\r\ncollective vision for the region, slowly but surely.\r\nWe look forward to the day when Belgrade and\r\nPristina will be an easy bus ride away from each other,\r\nwhen Jerusalem and Damascus, Athens and Ankara and,\r\nof course, the two parts of divided Nicosia, will no longer\r\nbe separated by fear and suspicion, but be joined in\r\npeace. Perhaps that day is still far away, but as a Chinese\r\nproverb has it, a journey of a thousand miles begins with\r\none small step.\r\nThis step we dared take this year. We dared to\r\nimagine the world at the end of a thousand miles. Rigas\r\nFereos, a prominent Greek revolutionary, wrote in a\r\nconstitution for the Balkans more than two centuries ago,\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\n“All should be equal with equal rights without\r\nprejudice in the Balkans: Christian, Muslim and Jew,\r\nAlbanian, Slav, Romanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Turk,\r\nArmenian, from Bosnia to Arabia.”\r\nToday, 100 days before the next millennium, we\r\ncommit ourselves to keep walking in this direction of a new\r\nhope and vision for our world. As they say in Latin\r\nAmerica, se hace camino al andar.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Niels Helveg Petersen, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): Let me first associate\r\nmyself with the statement of my colleague, the Finnish\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nLet me also, Mr. President, congratulate you on your\r\nelection. Denmark\u0027s relations with Namibia and with you\r\npersonally go back to long before your country\u0027s\r\nindependence. I am therefore particularly gratified to see\r\nyou in this position.\r\nIn my statement today, I should like to dwell upon the\r\nresponsibility of the international community, including, of\r\ncourse, the United Nations, for human security and\r\ndevelopment. We live in an ever more globalized world.\r\nAlmost every day we are confronted with new challenges\r\nthat must be met. Distance or ignorance of events no longer\r\nprovides a sense of security.\r\nClose international cooperation is needed to meet the\r\nchallenges. But paradoxically, although the challenges are\r\nglobal, policy-making and institutions still remain\r\npredominantly national in focus and scope.\r\nIncreasingly we see internal conflicts and blatant\r\nviolations of human rights and humanitarian law pose a\r\nspecial and serious kind of threat. Terrorism, drug-\r\ntrafficking and international crime also thrive in a\r\nglobalized world.\r\nThe international community must possess the means\r\nand display the resolve to confront such challenges. Our\r\nfundamental concerns about human security and human\r\ndevelopment cannot be met only in a domestic context.\r\nI should like to illustrate these concerns, first, in\r\nrelation to the Kosovo and East Timor crises and, secondly,\r\nwith regard to international development cooperation.\r\nKosovo and East Timor raised serious questions with\r\nregard to the classic concepts of State sovereignty, the\r\nrespect for human rights and the non-use of force in\r\ninternational relations. How do these concepts interrelate?\r\nHow do they relate to our concern for human security?\r\nAnd what does the interrelationship mean for the role and\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations and for the Security\r\nCouncil?\r\nThe first point to be made is that the international\r\ncommunity cannot be idle in the face of gross and\r\nsystematic violations of human rights. Nor can we stand\r\nidly by if the United Nations and its representatives, who\r\nhave assisted a people in exercising its right to self-\r\ndetermination, are trampled on.\r\nInternational law finds itself at a crossroads. We\r\nhave spent the last 50 years developing an impressive\r\nbody of human rights law, applicable in time of peace as\r\nwell as during armed conflict, starting with the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Indeed, there is no shortage\r\nof rules. What is lacking is effective implementation of\r\nexisting rules, in the very last resort through the use of\r\nforce.\r\nWe must now aim at enforcement in order to\r\nprovide assistance, regardless of frontiers, to the victims\r\nof human rights violations. We must show resolve in\r\npromoting respect for the rule of law and for the\r\ninstitutions called upon to uphold the rule of law. A broad\r\nspectrum of actions is available; the choice of action must\r\ndepend on the problem we face. The thorny question is\r\nwhether and when to use military force in the face of an\r\nemerging humanitarian catastrophe, such as a planned\r\nethnic cleansing or downright genocide.\r\nIt cannot be emphasized too often that a negotiated\r\nsettlement must remain the primary and ultimate goal of\r\nany conflict solution. If, however, all attempts at securing\r\na peaceful solution fail or are brushed aside, the question\r\nof whether to use force in one form or another arises.\r\nThis brings the United Nations Security Council to the\r\nforefront. The Council has the primary responsibility for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. It has carried\r\nout its functions as foreseen in the United Nations Charter\r\nin a much more effective and innovative way since the\r\nend of the cold war. I am referring, in particular, to the\r\nconflicts in relation to Iraq, Bosnia, Haiti, and Albania. A\r\nmain challenge for the Security Council remains that of\r\nreacting effectively against gross and systematic violations\r\nof human rights conducted against an entire population.\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThe Council has interpreted its competence under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter to cover humanitarian situations\r\nthat shock the conscience of mankind. This augurs well for\r\nthe victims of brutal oppression and ill for the dictators of\r\ntoday. Oppressors of whole peoples, mass murderers and\r\nethnic cleansers can no longer invoke the shield of national\r\nsovereignty. Nor can they expect impunity. The\r\ninternational community has a responsibility to act in the\r\nface of a humanitarian tragedy such as the one we\r\nwitnessed in Kosovo and the one we are witnessing in East\r\nTimor.\r\nUnfortunately, the Council was not able to live up to\r\nits responsibilities concerning the ethnic cleansing in\r\nKosovo. Should the paralysis of the Council lead to blind\r\nacceptance? No; the international community could not\r\nstand idly by and watch, while the principle of State\r\nsovereignty was misused in Kosovo to violate international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nIn this serious situation the decision to launch the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization campaign was legitimate\r\nand justified. It opened the way to a political solution,\r\nbringing the United Nations back into a central role.\r\nIn East Timor we were faced with widespread,\r\norganized atrocities against a civilian population exercising\r\nits right to self-determination. In addition, the risk of total\r\ndisregard for the United Nations was looming. Fortunately,\r\nthe Security Council was not paralysed. Pressure from the\r\ninternational community brought about action. An\r\nagreement was reached to deploy a multinational force.\r\nWe welcome this development.\r\nWe urge the Indonesian Government to cooperate fully\r\nwith the multinational force. In the meantime, the\r\nIndonesian Government remains responsible for the security\r\nof the population. It must make it possible for the\r\nhumanitarian organizations to provide assistance for the\r\nlarge number of displaced persons in East Timor.\r\nWe all share the responsibility for enabling the\r\ninternational community to address these issues and for\r\nenabling the United Nations to act. Where force has to be\r\nresorted to, we have to look to countries possessing that\r\ncapability. In practical terms, this means that we often have\r\nto rely upon countries and organizations in the region.\r\nThe Security Council must do its utmost to live up to\r\nits primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace,\r\nsecurity and humanitarian decency — a primary\r\nresponsibility that all the Member States have vested in\r\nthe Security Council in accordance with Article 24 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nThe Council\u0027s permanent members should apply the\r\nveto only in matters of vital importance, taking into\r\naccount their unique responsibility for the interests of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. And they should state on what\r\ngrounds they consider such a situation to be present.\r\nThe Secretary-General has said,\r\n“any armed intervention is itself a result of the\r\nfailure of prevention”. (A/54/PV.4)\r\nI agree with the Secretary-General that conflict prevention\r\nand resolution must be given the highest possible priority\r\nin international relations. It should be carried out on the\r\nbasis of a common resolve to secure human rights for all.\r\nThe United Nations constitutes a needed and valuable tool\r\nto this end.\r\nConflict resolution must, of course, not become only\r\na question of the use of force. Let me point to two\r\nimportant aspects of the post-conflict situation. First,\r\nthose who are responsible for war crimes and crimes\r\nagainst humanity must be brought to justice. The creation\r\nof the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and\r\nRwanda were important first steps towards establishing an\r\neffective international legal order based upon democratic\r\nvalues and the rule of law. The work of the tribunals has\r\nunderlined the need for a permanent international criminal\r\ncourt designed to bring to justice those who have\r\ncommitted crimes of the most heinous kind. The\r\nprospects for lasting peace and reconciliation are severely\r\nundermined if war criminals and the like remain at large.\r\nThe historic adoption last year in Rome of a statute\r\nfor a permanent international criminal court is a landmark\r\ncontribution to restoring the rule of law and ending\r\nimpunity. Although not perfect, the Rome Statute\r\nprovides a satisfactory basis for an effective and credible\r\ncourt. We urge all States to ratify the Statute as early as\r\npossible in order to put this historic building block in\r\nplace. Denmark intends to ratify in the spring of the year\r\n2000.\r\nSecondly, post-conflict assistance must be provided\r\nto the societies split by civil strife or war. Denmark is\r\nready to do its part. With respect to the western Balkans,\r\nwe initially provided assistance to refugees and for their\r\nsafe return. Now we are gradually turning to assistance in\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nreconstruction and rebuilding of both physical and social\r\ninfrastructure. A plan of action for Denmark\u0027s support in\r\nthis respect has been drawn up. The plan expects Danish\r\nfunds in the order of $100 million dollars to be used in the\r\nregion in 1999 and around $120 million dollars in the year\r\n2000.\r\nThe reconstruction of Kosovo is important. It includes\r\nthe establishment of a well-functioning civil administration.\r\nThe United Nations family and many non-governmental\r\norganizations are undertaking important tasks which deserve\r\nour full support. All parties must strive to heal the wounds\r\nof conflict.\r\nInternational relations and international cooperation are\r\nnot based on a one-issue agenda. Certain issues may grab\r\nand almost monopolize the headlines for a while. In Europe\r\nwe have to deal with the Balkans. But we must not neglect\r\nthe other important issues on the international agenda, in\r\nparticular international development cooperation and the\r\nstruggle for the eradication of poverty.\r\nIn a world where a third of the population of\r\ndeveloping countries earns less than $1 per day, where 30\r\nper cent of all children under five in those countries are\r\nunderweight, where 14 per cent of the population will not\r\nattain the age of 40, where financial crisis has led to a\r\nmajor setback in poverty reduction — in such a world\r\ndevelopment cooperation must remain an integral part of\r\nthe effort of the international community to promote and\r\nprotect human security and human development.\r\nThe international community must acknowledge its\r\nshare of the responsibility for making the opportunities of\r\nglobalization available to all. Globalization must not\r\nbecome identical with protected and selective prosperity.\r\nEradication of poverty is an essential goal in its own\r\nright. Furthermore, poverty is an important cause of\r\nconflict. And again, violent conflict may undo the results of\r\ndecades of development. Development cooperation,\r\ntherefore, constitutes an effective crisis-prevention effort for\r\nthe long term.\r\nInternational development cooperation must be based\r\non the fulfilment as soon as possible of the agreed target of\r\n0.7 per cent of gross domestic product for official\r\ndevelopment assistance and on implementing the decisions\r\nof the big United Nations conferences of recent years with\r\nregard to human and social development, eradication of\r\npoverty, sustainable development and gender equality. The\r\nfollow-up conferences to the Beijing conference and, in the\r\nyear 2000, to the Copenhagen summit are important\r\nevents requiring our full attention.\r\nDenmark stands by these commitments. We will\r\ncontinue our policy of contributing 1 per cent of our gross\r\nnational product to official development assistance.\r\nPoverty reduction is the prime goal of our development\r\ncooperation programmes. In addition, we are providing\r\nfunding to help address global problems in the field of the\r\nenvironment as well as peacekeeping and conflict\r\nprevention. These grants will grow in the coming years,\r\nreaching half of 1 per cent of gross domestic product by\r\nthe year 2005, thus bringing Denmark\u0027s total contribution\r\nto international assistance to 1.5 per cent of gross\r\ndomestic product.\r\nCreating an enabling environment for development\r\nis a challenge, first of all for developing countries\r\nthemselves. Reforms cannot be imposed from the outside.\r\nIf they are to succeed, local ownership and local roots are\r\nessential. Official development assistance has an essential\r\nrole to play in helping the poorest countries, particularly\r\nin Africa. Official development assistance also assists in\r\nbuilding up the sectors that do not attract private\r\ninvestment: health, education, the social sectors and\r\ncapacity-building in general. In this way, countries may\r\nalso, eventually, become able to attract private investment\r\nand to avail themselves of the opportunities of\r\ninternational trade.\r\nIn this context, it is deplorable to see official\r\ndevelopment assistance reaching its lowest point ever.\r\nHonouring the commitments of official development\r\nassistance entered into internationally by industrialized\r\ncountries has become a question of credibility. It is also\r\na question of the effectiveness of the multilateral system.\r\nThe United Nations system cannot perform the tasks we\r\nask of it if we deny it the necessary means. The\r\ndownward trend of official development assistance must\r\nbe reversed and a higher share should be multilateral.\r\nMany poor countries are crippled with debt\r\nhampering their development. We therefore welcome the\r\nproposals to improve the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\nDebt (HIPC) Initiative. We are, however, disappointed by\r\nthe lack of progress in financing the Initiative. We appeal\r\nto the major donor countries to live up to their\r\nresponsibilities following the debt declaration of the\r\nCologne summit.\r\nBesides aid, not instead of aid, developing countries\r\nneed trade. In the forthcoming new global trade round,\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nevery effort must be made to ensure better market access\r\nfor developing countries and to enhance their real capacity\r\nto take part in international trade.\r\nThe pursuit of human security and human development\r\nare not two independent paths. They are interrelated.\r\nWithout economic and social development, it makes no\r\nsense to talk about human security. Where security does not\r\nexist, there will be no sustainable development. When\r\nviolent conflict erupts, the results of decades of\r\ndevelopment may be undone in a very short time. We must\r\nuphold the importance of both concerns and we must\r\nemphasize that they are a national as well as an\r\ninternational responsibility.\r\nWe thus face a major challenge at the threshold of the\r\nnext millennium — a challenge we should give proper\r\nattention to at the Millennium Assembly next year.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call\r\non the Minister of External Affairs of India, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jaswant Singh.\r\nMr. Singh (India): It is a particular pleasure to see\r\nMr. Gurirab presiding over the last session of the General\r\nAssembly of the twentieth century. I consider myself\r\nsingularly fortunate and greatly honoured to be representing\r\nmy country, India, on this occasion. I do believe that, in the\r\nmany years that he spent here pursuing the dream of\r\nindependence for his people — which, happily, is now a\r\nreality — he, more perhaps than others, has seen the United\r\nNations at its best. That is why the perspective that he\r\nbrings to the office of the President, enriched as it is by\r\nliving through the very articles of faith of the United\r\nNations, is near unique. I am sure we will all profit from it.\r\nI take this opportunity also to warmly welcome three\r\nnew Members to the United Nations: Kiribati, Nauru and\r\nTonga. I have no doubt their presence shall enrich our\r\ndeliberations.\r\nEven as I address this Assembly, the century draws to\r\na close and the world prepares to meet the year 2000. It is\r\nonly appropriate and instructive, therefore, to look back and\r\nto reflect upon the journey that humanity set out upon 100\r\nyears ago. Where did we think we were then headed and\r\nwhere have we actually reached? Could any then foresee\r\nwhat 1999 would bring? Thus, are there, in the passage of\r\nthe years that have gone by, any landmarks that could\r\nindicate a path for our future? For that, we need to assess\r\nthe twentieth century, and there is but one yardstick by\r\nwhich we can judge: the criteria of the stated objectives\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIndisputably, the twentieth has been the bloodiest of\r\nall centuries. But, in contradistinction, it has also been a\r\ncentury of the most profound transformations and of the\r\nmost significant social, political and technological\r\nadvancements. This, above all, has been the century of\r\nthe ascendancy of the individual and of democracy. It is\r\nthat period in which dynasties vanished and revolutions\r\nswept empires off the face of ancient lands. Centuries-old\r\ncolonialism became history against the irresistible heave\r\nof the colonized to reclaim their lands, their souls, so that\r\noppressed humanity could regain a voice, a say in its own\r\npolitical and economic destiny. It is the century in which\r\nwe plumbed the depths of the oceans and soared into the\r\ninfinities of space; when man first set foot on the moon,\r\nreached Mars and even deeper into the recesses of the\r\nunknown. In a wired-up world, the computer has today\r\nbecome what the fountain pen was in the early years of\r\nthe twentieth century. The revolution of the digital has\r\narrived.\r\nHumanity today is healthier, better fed and more\r\nsheltered than our forefathers were. But want and hunger,\r\ndisease and deprivation are still widespread, including in\r\ndeveloped societies. We have at our command more\r\ninformation than ever before, but are we that much wiser?\r\nLiteracy has spread, but is mankind better educated? We\r\nare more connected globally, but are we as humankind?\r\nHave this linkage and interconnection reduced conflict\r\nand animosity? And thus, the tabulation of our assets and\r\nliabilities of this century flows.\r\nAs we have improved upon and added to almost\r\neverything that we inherited in 1900, so most sadly have\r\nwe to violence, too. This century has been the most\r\nbloodthirsty, perhaps because it is in these last 100 years\r\nthat humanity has employed science to perfect means of\r\nkilling as never before. Our passage has seen us move\r\nfrom the Gatling gun to a world menaced today by\r\nMIRVs. That early machine gun, the then-great mower\r\ndown of the early 1900s, seems today almost a toy by\r\ncomparison. We have split the atom, but employ the\r\nreleased energy less for peace and more for weapons of\r\nunimaginable destruction. Chemical defoliants and\r\nsophisticated biological weapons are also this century\u0027s\r\ncontribution.\r\nThe century that passes experienced not two, but\r\nthree great wars. Each was a cataclysm, fought globally\r\nand at enormous cost. When the first ended, the survivors\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nemerged from the trenches, searching for a better world so\r\nthat war would not recur. In response, we created the\r\nLeague of Nations. But war, regrettably, was not avoided.\r\nThe League failed because we failed the League. And thus\r\nfollowed the second great war, at the end of which the\r\nworld emerged armed with weapons that could destroy all\r\nthat human genius and ingenuity had created and every\r\nvestige of life. But, from the ruins and devastation of the\r\nsecond also emerged the United Nations, with mandates of\r\nbroader powers and responsibilities. The third great conflict\r\nwas the cold war. This deeply affected, shaped and\r\ninfluenced the development of the United Nations. This\r\nwar, too, extracted a heavy price, directly and through\r\nproxy conflicts, as well as political and social upheavals,\r\nbut then these became its epilogue. What significance lies\r\nin the observation that no global peace conference has taken\r\nplace to mark the end of this last war?\r\nThe United Nations could have been cast anew, made\r\ncontemporary and democratized, drawing upon our\r\ncollective experience to tackle new challenges with greater\r\nresponsiveness. Can we, even now, do something at this\r\nlast session of the General Assembly of this millennium to\r\ncorrect this? Can we pledge afresh to invest this institution\r\nwith faith, commitment, political will and the resources that\r\nit needs to make it the vehicle capable of realizing the\r\naspirations of all humanity, an instrument that will steer\r\nplanet Earth into the next century?\r\nWe do not enjoy an abundance of options. The\r\nsapping of the vitality or the diminishing of the centrality\r\nof the United Nations must not be permitted. We have but\r\none Earth, and there is but one United Nations.\r\nAnother development of this century, of crucial\r\nsignificance, is the transformation that we have experienced\r\nin the role of the State. From an agency that controlled and\r\nregulated all spheres of human activity, we move into a\r\nphase wherein the State must become more supportive,\r\ncaring and encouraging of the citizen\u0027s individual and\r\ncollective endeavours; it must release, not contain, the\r\nenergies and genius of its people.\r\nIt would be an error, however, to assume that the days\r\nof the State are over. The State continues to have a crucial\r\nrole and relevance; also, therefore, do national\r\nsovereignties. The United Nations was not conceived as a\r\nsuper-State. It will not ever become so, principally because\r\nthere is no viable substitute for the sovereign State. Even\r\nglobalization can work only through State intermediaries.\r\nTo diminish, marginalize or ignore the State would also be\r\nbad practice, because the weaker the State is rendered, the\r\nless it shall be able to promote the interests of its citizens.\r\nThe State needs to be strengthened functionally, not\r\nweakened. Besides, it is axiomatic that a United Nations\r\nof weak nations can only be a weak United Nations.\r\nGlobalization is an idea that has re-emerged, but also\r\nits reverse: fragmentation. The first is politico-economic,\r\nthe second entirely political. Let us dwell a bit on this.\r\nObviously, the technology that is driving this process can\r\nnow scarcely be unlearned; the speed of travel and of\r\ncommunications will only increase; the age of the digital,\r\nas I said, has dawned. However, though globalization may\r\napparently be driven by impersonal market forces, it is in\r\nreality impelled by power seeking political and financial\r\nadvantage. It is, in essence, a political process, and if\r\nhistory teaches us anything, it is that such processes are\r\nnot linear. Simply in terms of economic indicators, the\r\nworld was as globalized at the turn of the century as it is\r\nnow. A backlash followed: barriers went up, confrontation\r\nreplaced cooperation and the world jostled into the\r\ntensions that led to the first great war. Are we, for the\r\nsake of temporary gain, perhaps even unwittingly,\r\nrepeating yesterday\u0027s mistakes? Political hindsight tells us\r\nthat globalization has to be politically directed for\r\ncreating equal economic opportunity, both within States\r\nand among States.\r\nIn India, we cherish the creative genius of the\r\npeople. We believe that Indian excellence lies in the\r\nfreedom of the individual. We do not subscribe to\r\nconstricting choice through State impositions. But can free\r\nmarkets offer true freedom of choice to those that are not\r\neven a part of the market? That is why the State\r\ncontinues to have the responsibility to protect the needy,\r\nto strengthen the weak. That is a part of our democratic\r\ncreed, too.\r\nWe note that human rights have been made a cross-\r\ncutting theme of the work of the United Nations. That is\r\nimportant. The flowering, however, of human rights\r\nrequires economic development and growth because many\r\nof the deprivations faced by individuals, whether in the\r\ndeveloped or in the developing world, are rooted in\r\nmarginalization created by poverty. We believe, therefore,\r\nthat development should be the cross-cutting theme of the\r\nUnited Nations and that the multilateral development\r\nsystem, which has been one of its successes, must be\r\nstrengthened, its focus narrowed to the core challenges of\r\neconomic growth with social justice, and it must be given\r\nthe resources it requires to respond to the needs of the\r\ndeveloping countries. The international community will\r\nfind that no investment yields better returns.\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nI have the honour to address the Assembly as a\r\nrepresentative of the largest democracy in the world. Even\r\nnow, as I share these thoughts, an electorate of about 600\r\nmillion, matching the combined populations of the United\r\nStates, Canada and Western Europe, is going through the\r\nexciting process of democratically electing its next\r\nGovernment in my country. It is an awe-inspiring spectacle,\r\nthis unstoppable flow of the great Ganga of Indian\r\ndemocracy. It is a democracy whose economy grew by\r\nmore than 6 per cent last year, even in the aftermath of the\r\nmajor shocks to the international economy brought about by\r\nwhat was described as the East Asian meltdown of the mid-\r\n1990s.\r\nWe move with the challenges posed by globalization,\r\nwithout either retreating into a “fortress India” or\r\nabandoning our social objectives. We have worked out our\r\nown answers and devised our own policies to meet these\r\nnew challenges because we hold that the sheer diversity of\r\nmankind dictates differences in approach, in human beings\u0027\r\nrespective search for relevant alternatives. This is a truth\r\nborne out by the fact that the twentieth century has been\r\nwitness to the detritus of many false certainties.\r\nToday, when capital moves without almost any\r\nconstraint, it is virtually impossible for developing countries\r\nto resist either its demands or manage the consequences of\r\nits sudden departure. Let us reflect upon the absence of\r\norder, system or any global oversight of currency flows,\r\nparticularly short-term flows, even as we attempt to bring\r\norder and equity to trade in goods, services and\r\ncommodities. But how are we to address the problem when\r\ncurrency, instead of being a vehicle of trade, has in itself\r\nbecome a commodity of trade, when the volume of trade in\r\ncurrency daily has outstripped global trade in goods and\r\nservices or even global gross national product manifold?\r\nIf globalization is to benefit all, and as we simply\r\ncannot accept that wheels of progress should grind down\r\nthe common man, then surely some new international\r\nregulation, some order, is needed here. Let the United\r\nNations take the initiative to hold an urgent international\r\nconference on financing for development.\r\nIn the political domain, too, managing change\r\ndemands openness and reasoned discourse, an essential\r\ningredient of which is abjuring violence. That is why\r\nterrorism is the very antithesis of all that the United\r\nNations represents and stands for. Terrorism is the great\r\nglobal menace of our age. In this age of democracy, it is a\r\nviolation of the very basic precepts of it. Because its\r\nprincipal targets become the innocent, it is a crime against\r\nhumanity, a violation of basic human rights. It is also\r\nnow a grave threat to international peace and security.\r\nThat is why I urge that we strengthen the international\r\nconsensus against terrorism. India has called for a\r\ncomprehensive international convention against terrorism.\r\nWe hope to make progress on the issue in this session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nWe also know how terrorism uses the international\r\nfinancial system, how it exploits the breakdown of\r\ncountries and societies, and how it has preyed on the\r\nnexus between drugs and the proliferation of small arms.\r\nThus, today, we witness a scimitar of narco-terrorism\r\ncutting across the Caucasus to the South Asian\r\nsubcontinent. Two of the world’s largest sources of illicit\r\ndrugs flank us. Terrorism financed by drugs has for years\r\nbeen the deadly export of our neighbours.\r\nHere the crippling intermixing of cause and effect is\r\ncruelly exemplified in Afghanistan. The world has been\r\nwitness to the decades-old distress of the innocent men,\r\nwomen and children of that country. The disorders of\r\nAfghanistan, and the near anarchy into which that country\r\nhas been pushed, are a consequence, chiefly, of the play\r\nof external forces and of a reversion to medieval\r\nfundamentalism of the most obscurantist variety. This\r\ndisorder now overspills; it is also exported. It is not that\r\nhuman rights, particularly of women and children, are\r\nroutinely violated there; they simply do not exist.\r\nOur relationships with this neighbour are ancient and\r\nrooted in a past that we share. That is why we urge this\r\nAssembly to be seized of the enormous human suffering\r\nof the Afghans, and to encourage and support the early\r\nformation of a Government truly representative of all\r\nsections of that society and country.\r\nTerrorism is a menace to which open societies are\r\nvulnerable; it becomes particularly difficult for\r\ndemocracies to counter when terrorists are armed,\r\nfinanced and backed by Governments or their agencies,\r\nand benefit from the protection of State power. Cross-\r\nborder terrorism, sponsored from across our borders, has\r\ntaken the lives of thousands of our citizens and ruined\r\nthose of countless others. We will counter it, as we have\r\ndone over the past decades, using the methods available\r\nto a democracy. India will defeat such forces. That is both\r\nour duty and our obligation to our citizens.\r\nEarlier this year India was subjected, yet again, to an\r\nact of premeditated aggression. In February this year,\r\nhoping yet again to set aside the sterility of relations of\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nthe past half century to set the South Asian subcontinent on\r\nthe path of development, with a view to addressing the real\r\nadversaries of our region — poverty, want and hunger —\r\nPrime Minister Vajpayee extended a hand of peace, amity\r\nand cooperation to neighbouring Pakistan. The pathbreaking\r\nbus journey from Delhi to Lahore followed. In Lahore we\r\nconcluded a triad of agreements, among which was the\r\nLahore Declaration. It was the route chart of moving\r\ntowards lasting amity and peace.\r\nThis act of faith was betrayed. Premeditated\r\naggression by regular forces was committed against India.\r\nNot simply was the Lahore Declaration violated, but so was\r\nthe Simla Agreement, which had prevented conflict for\r\nmore than a quarter of a century. In self-defence, yet with\r\nthe utmost restraint, India took all necessary and\r\nappropriate steps to evict the aggressor forces from its\r\nterritory. Most regrettably, this aggression has set back the\r\nLahore process of peace that we had initiated. For whereas\r\naggression over territory can more easily be vacated, that\r\nterritory of trust which has been transgressed is infinitely\r\nmore difficult to restore.\r\nPermit me, Sir, to draw attention to the fact that this\r\naggression upon India in Kargil was a demonstration of\r\nwanting to hold to ransom the world, through an act of\r\naggression. It was also a manifestation of the larger\r\ndisorders that the world has been witnessing in Afghanistan.\r\nThere is an aspect that I stress. It was a gross violation\r\nof the Geneva Conventions when Indian soldiers taken\r\nprisoner were tortured, subjected to inhuman treatment and\r\nkilled in captivity. These violations took place at a time\r\nwhen the international community has repeatedly been\r\ntrying to establish the rule of law, stripping away the layers\r\nof impunity that have protected those who give the orders\r\nthat lead to violations of international humanitarian law.\r\nAnd it is thus that I find it necessary to reiterate some\r\nessential verities of Indian nationhood. From the earliest\r\ndays of our struggle against imperialism and colonial rule\r\nit has been an unquestionable article of faith with us that\r\nIndia is one nation: a nation of many faiths, a diversity of\r\nbeliefs, a cultural harmony arranged through the interplay\r\nof myriad forms and manifestations, but a unity,\r\nstrengthened by its pluralism, that is beyond question. And\r\nof this is born India’s democratic vitality, too. Also of this\r\noneness and unity, the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir\r\nis an integral part, and shall remain so. Because this is not\r\nany territorial dispute; it is the assertion of two antipodal\r\napproaches to national identity. India has never represented\r\ndenominational nationhood; it is civic nationalism to which\r\nwe subscribe. That is why Jammu and Kashmir is not a\r\nso-called core issue. It is at the very core of Indian\r\nnationhood.\r\nYet the path of the India-Pakistan composite\r\ndialogue process is open. No preconditions attend it. The\r\nonly essential ingredient that remains is an abjuring of\r\nviolence and cross-border terrorism, principles that are\r\nintegral to both the Simla Agreement and the Lahore\r\nDeclaration — indeed, the very process of peace itself.\r\nThis process needs to be resumed.\r\nWe have been greatly disappointed by this\r\ncompulsive hostility of Pakistan, because it is an\r\naberration in our region today, where all the other South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\r\ncountries are at peace with each other, and are trying,\r\nbilaterally and through the SAARC mechanisms, to tackle\r\ntogether the great challenge of development. But we\r\nremain unshaken in our vision of cooperation and shared\r\nprosperity of the South Asian region, as embedded in the\r\nCharter of SAARC, as well as in our faith in the ability,\r\ntalent and will of the people of the region to take their\r\nrightful place in the world community. The destiny of all\r\nour peoples is linked. It is a region with a collective\r\nhistory reaching back to the beginnings of human history\r\nand of the highest civilizational accomplishments. In\r\nstriving to attain the promise of the future in our region,\r\nwe also see the recovery of a great past.\r\nThis is perhaps the right juncture at which to say a\r\nfew words about pluralism in an age of globalization.\r\nThough we find sterile the debate over universal and\r\nregional values, extreme positions are still taken on both\r\nsides. In a spirit of engagement, we would urge our\r\npartners in the West to be a bit more tolerant, and a bit\r\nmore introspective. While all democratic Governments try\r\nto promote good governance, human rights and social\r\nresponsibility, the perspective they approach them from,\r\nand their ability to implement them, vary. Rigidly\r\napplying, as a universal paradigm, value systems that\r\nreflect the state of western economies and societies in the\r\nlate twentieth century, produces an inevitable reaction,\r\nwhich does not make either for dialogue or constructive\r\ndecisions.\r\nGlobalization has also influenced our thinking on\r\nsecurity issues by generating a greater awareness about\r\nnew security concerns. Equally important, with the end of\r\nthe cold war there is a growing realization that peace\r\ncannot be maintained through balance of power or\r\nhegemonic order. To maintain global peace and security,\r\n42\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nto deal with threats of a global nature, the international\r\ncommunity has to accept the concept of collective security.\r\nThe United Nations provides a framework for such a\r\ncontract among nations. With the cold war behind us, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should reactivate this framework.\r\nGlobal nuclear disarmament was the objective set out\r\nby the 1946 General Assembly in the first resolution that it\r\nadopted. That objective still beckons us.\r\nI say this as the representative of a country that has\r\nbeen obliged to acquire nuclear weapons because of the\r\nfailure of the existing non-proliferation regime to address\r\nour primary security concerns. Yet let me also state with\r\nfull conviction that India’s commitment to global nuclear\r\ndisarmament stands undiluted. India is the only nuclear-\r\nweapon State ready to negotiate a nuclear weapons\r\nconvention that will prohibit for ever the development,\r\nproduction, stockpiling, use and threat of use of nuclear\r\nweapons and provide for the elimination of all existing\r\nweapons under international verification.\r\nIf this can only be a step-by-step process, the first step\r\nat a technical level is for all countries possessing nuclear\r\nweapons to take measures that will reduce the dangers of,\r\nand provide added safeguards against, any unintended or\r\naccidental use. Coupled with this is the political step of\r\nreorienting nuclear doctrines, towards no-first-use, and then\r\nnon-use, thus delegitimizing nuclear weapons globally.\r\nIndependent expert opinion across the globe has spoken\r\nstrongly in favour of such measures. In fact, every single\r\nstudy that has been published since the end of the cold war\r\non the measures to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world\r\nhas highlighted the need for shifting to doctrines based on\r\nno-first-use and non-use, and technical measures towards\r\nde-alerting, as the inevitable first steps in the process. We\r\nhave taken initiatives to urge the international community\r\nforward on both counts, and hope that in this General\r\nAssembly session the Indian initiatives will receive the\r\nunanimous support that they merit.\r\nLast year my Prime Minister declared in this\r\nAssembly that India was engaged in discussions on a range\r\nof issues, including the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT). These discussions are in process and will\r\nbe resumed by the newly- elected Government of my\r\ncountry. Our position remains consistent. We remain ready\r\nto bring these discussions to a successful conclusion.\r\nNaturally, this requires the creation of a positive\r\nenvironment as we work towards creating the widest\r\npossible consensus domestically. We also expect that other\r\ncountries will adhere to this Treaty without any conditions.\r\nNotwithstanding India’s readiness to engage in\r\nconstructive negotiations on a treaty to prohibit the future\r\nproduction of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and\r\nnuclear explosive devices, the Conference on\r\nDisarmament in Geneva has so far, sadly, been unable to\r\nregister any forward movement. This, too, is something to\r\nponder over, for we all know that a fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty (FMCT) can only contribute to our shared objective\r\nas part of a step-by-step process. Let us then overcome\r\nthis reluctance and agree to look beyond the FMCT.\r\nSo, at the end of this centennial audit, what is it that\r\nwe would want the United Nations to do in the first few\r\nyears? It is clear that there are two major problems facing\r\nthe United Nations as an institution: Security Council\r\nreform and the United Nations financial crisis. These need\r\nto be addressed. The Security Council must be made\r\nmore representative, with developing countries inducted\r\nas permanent members, to reflect the changes in the\r\nUnited Nations membership and today’s political realities.\r\nAs we said earlier, on any objective criteria, India’s\r\ncredentials for permanent membership are persuasive.\r\nSustainable and environmentally sound development\r\nis a goal to which India continues to attach the utmost\r\nimportance. In 2002 we will complete a decade of\r\nAgenda 21, adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. I\r\ntrust that the current session of the General Assembly will\r\nput in place a preparatory process for the “Rio + 10”\r\nreview. This will enable the Member States to take stock\r\nof the implementation of the commitments undertaken by\r\nthe Member States in Agenda 21 over the past decade.\r\nSuch a process is vital for attaining our common goal of\r\nsustainable and environmentally sound development.\r\nThis century has shown us that our challenges are\r\ncommon; they are intertwined. Problems flow across\r\nboundaries, they batten on each other. Political, security,\r\neconomic and social challenges are braided around each\r\nother; when they form a knot, that has to be cut by all of\r\nus together. Here, and nowhere else, can we do this. It is\r\nconvenient to look at security issues in the First\r\nCommittee, at economic issues in the Second, at human\r\nrights and social issues in the Third, and so on, but we\r\noften do not see them together, and so fail to use the\r\nUnited Nations as we should.\r\nMay I, in conclusion, therefore, propose that in the\r\nnext decade the United Nations endeavour to address the\r\nmost urgent problems that face us today. We have to do\r\nthis as a unity of nations, as also of issues, for it is\r\nevident that solutions in one field will depend on, or be\r\n43\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nfacilitated by, progress in another. Without tackling them\r\ntogether we will fail to address them at all. Therefore, may\r\nI urge the Assembly to consider the following areas for\r\naction in the opening years of the next decade: an\r\ninternational conference on financing for development;\r\nbinding, irreversible steps to reduce the dangers of use of\r\nnuclear weapons; reform and expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil; a comprehensive convention against terrorism; and\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations development system in\r\nthis era of globalization.\r\nI leave you with a sloka from the Rigveda. Though\r\nwritten 5,000 years ago, it reaches across time to us as at\r\nthis session of the General Assembly, in the last year of the\r\ntwentieth century. In translation, it reads,\r\n“Be of one heart, one mind and free of hate.\r\nLet your aim be common, your assembly common,\r\nUnited your mind and thoughts;\r\nMay you make your resolutions with one mind,\r\nPerform your duties righteously.\r\nLet our hearts be together”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic) : I now call\r\non the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boris Shikhmuradov.\r\nMr. Shikhmuradov (Turkmenistan): First of all,\r\npermit me to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly. I would also like to\r\nexpress words of gratitude to Mr. Didier Opertti Badán for\r\nhis dynamic and competent work during the entire course\r\nof the preceding session.\r\nFor the United Nations, last year — if it were\r\nmeasured by the magnitude of military and political\r\nupheavals — would be equal to a calendar year that thrust\r\nupon mankind natural calamities that had catastrophic\r\neffects on people. In many respects it was a year from\r\nwhich we had to draw lessons. It made us ponder seriously\r\nthe political survival of States and the physical protection\r\nof people. It made us take a fresh look at the system of\r\ninternational relations, which was helpless in the face of the\r\nnew challenges of the times. Nowadays we can no longer\r\nwrite everything off as costs of the cold war.\r\nThat is why we have paid special attention to the part\r\nof the Secretary-General’s report in which he tried to give\r\na analysis of present-day conflicts. Those conflicts, because\r\nof the nature of their origins and the dynamics of their\r\nevolution, did not always yield to traditional forms and\r\nmethods for their successful resolution. There is a fact\r\ndescribed in the report that requires special consideration,\r\nnamely, that over the past decade 90 per cent of armed\r\nconflicts took place inside States and not between them.\r\nThis phenomenon shows how relevant the problem of\r\nstatehood is, as well as defining the correct orientation, in\r\nchoosing the road to development in today’s world. The\r\npreservation of national unity, inter-ethnic harmony and\r\nsocial guarantees, coupled with a reasonable pace of\r\nreform, can today be considered as the basic universal\r\ncriteria for ensuring the peaceful development of every\r\nnation. This statement is substantiated by the experience\r\nof our newly independent State, which managed to avoid\r\nmany cataclysms in the difficult period of its emerging\r\nstatehood.\r\nThis is the eighth time that Turkmenistan has taken\r\npart in a session of the General Assembly as an\r\nindependent subject of international relations. Without the\r\nactive support of our friends, it would be hard to imagine\r\nthe state of Turkmenistan’s development today, which\r\nallows us to look with optimism at the future and to\r\nestablish long-term programmes of social and economic\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, we are grateful to our close\r\nneighbours — Iran, Russia, Turkey, Pakistan, China and\r\nIndia — and our partners in the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe. From a conceptual point of\r\nview, the system of Turkmenistan’s international relations\r\nis based on sincerity and reciprocity of mutual interests,\r\nneutrality and non-alignment, which form the two pillars\r\nof our statehood.\r\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\r\nexpress words of gratitude to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and to emphasize its\r\nlarge-scale activities, which merit all-round support. The\r\nGovernment of Turkmenistan, together with UNDP, has\r\nundertaken a number of major national projects that have\r\nyielded concrete results in the reforms of the social\r\nsphere, public health, the system of education and other\r\nareas. Turkmenistan intends to continue to maintain close\r\nties with that important agency of the United Nations,\r\nwith the aim of identifying and implementing new\r\nopportunities for cooperation. In view of the major\r\ndevelopment tasks lying ahead, UNDP personifies for us\r\nthe United Nations system as a whole.\r\nPurposeful cooperation between specialized agencies\r\nof the United Nations and national Governments makes it\r\npossible to identify the main parameters of the conflict-\r\nprevention strategy in each individual region. Ever-\r\nincreasing flows of refugees and displaced persons to\r\n44\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nneighbouring countries from conflict areas and zones of\r\nnational disasters are fraught with a certain potential for\r\ntension. As regards this important matter, we attach great\r\nimportance to the work of the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The\r\nGovernment of Turkmenistan, together with UNHCR, is\r\nimplementing an ad hoc programme of assistance to\r\nrefugees that is based on a joint plan of action.\r\nIn close relation to the above subject, I would like to\r\ndraw attention to the situation in Afghanistan, which\r\ncontinues to cause serious concern. Historically,\r\nTurkmenistan had close fraternal ties with that long-\r\nsuffering nation. Hence, we have a sincere interest in the\r\nre-establishment of peace and the restoration of\r\nAfghanistan. Since the first days of independence,\r\nTurkmenistan built its relations with Afghanistan on the\r\nbasis of mutual trust and respect. Our position is absolutely\r\ntransparent and clear: neutrality with respect to the parties\r\nto the conflict; a constructive attitude towards and a due\r\naccounting of the realities of today’s Afghanistan; a desire\r\nto engage conflicting parties in a dialogue; and creative\r\neconomic reconstruction programmes.\r\nIt is precisely this desire that underpinned our\r\ninitiative of holding two rounds of direct inter-Afghan talks\r\nin Ashgabat early this year, which were supported by the\r\ntwo key factions and bore fruit, giving hope for the future.\r\nHowever, in our opinion, this process did not receive\r\nadequate support from the outside, from those who are\r\nmore prone to making declarations of good intentions and\r\nadvancing their own interests rather than taking practical\r\nsteps to help the Afghan people. Turkmenistan has been\r\nworking on the Afghan issue and will continue to work on\r\nit under any format of international cooperation, including\r\nthe mechanism of the “six plus two” group under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, as that mechanism\r\npossesses an enormous untapped potential. We all have\r\ngrounds to raise this issue because we have actually\r\nencountered a situation that may not be the best one for the\r\nUnited Nations, which has financed a Special Mission in\r\nAfghanistan — a Mission that until now has failed to\r\nproduce any practical results. Smoothly written reports\r\nshould not substitute for real political work in the field.\r\nWe share a commonly held view that the United\r\nNations system needs rational reform in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The Millennium Assembly, on the theme of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century, will become a\r\nmajor landmark in this process, and Turkmenistan\r\nwholeheartedly supports the idea of holding such a session.\r\nThat Assembly could provide a unique opportunity to\r\nidentify the problems that we will face in the future and\r\nto undertake a creative process of strengthening and\r\nenhancing this unique institution.\r\nStatements by heads of delegations at the current\r\nsession contain many ideas regarding the need to reform\r\nthe United Nations and the Security Council and to\r\nbalance the right of veto, among many others.\r\nTurkmenistan adheres to the view that while seeking to\r\nimprove the situation, the most important thing is to take\r\na well-considered and balanced approach to the solution\r\nof the issues concerning the destiny of the Organization,\r\nrather than cause it harm by becoming hostage to\r\nemotions. It is our opinion that while encountering some\r\nglitches in the work of the mechanism, we should not\r\nrush into its complete replacement but should try to\r\nproperly diagnose the weakness in the available resources.\r\nIt may be a case of the problem not being in the system\r\nitself, but rather in those who are called to represent it at\r\nvarious levels.\r\nTurning once again to the problem of the elaboration\r\nand implementation of a system to prevent conflicts and\r\nensure safe development, I would like to emphasize that\r\nthe foreign policy course of neutrality pursued from the\r\noutset by Turkmenistan has always been aimed at\r\nprecisely this goal. It is explicitly mentioned in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report that the struggle for control\r\nover economic resources is one of the main causes of\r\nconflicts. Therefore the implementation of the foreign\r\npolicy initiative concerning Turkmenistan’s permanent\r\nneutrality, in the form of a special resolution adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly on 12 December 1995, has a very\r\nimportant meaning in this regard. The development of the\r\nextremely rich hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian\r\nbasin is tied to the interests not only of regional countries\r\nbut also to those of major Powers and transnational\r\ncompanies. Turkmenistan’s neutrality is aimed at a\r\nsituation of combined rather than conflicting interests.\r\nWe believe that in today’s world there can, and\r\nshould, exist zones of interest, but we resolutely oppose\r\nthe concept of spheres of influence. The issue concerning\r\nthe status of the Caspian Sea is highly relevant in this\r\nrespect. We have on numerous occasions stated our\r\nposition on this issue: we would like to prevent the work\r\non the status of the Caspian Sea from turning from an\r\ninternational law problem into a political problem. In any\r\ncase, we consider it appropriate at this forum to draw\r\nattention to this issue, so that we can avoid the\r\npoliticization of issues concerning the legal definition and\r\ndevelopment of the energy resources of the sea and\r\n45\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nunderline Turkmenistan’s readiness for constructive\r\npartnership and clearly defined reasonable compromises.\r\nThe highly complex nature of the tasks facing States\r\nMembers of the United Nations is clear. The momentous\r\nchallenges confronting the Organization are commensurate\r\nwith the hopes of people around the globe, who believe that\r\nreal change for the better will take place with the change of\r\nepochs. This concerns both large and small nations, the rich\r\nand the poor, newly independent and long-existing States.\r\nWe all face challenges that can be overcome only by means\r\nof collective efforts, recognizing at the same time individual\r\nresponsibilities. Such is the logic of Turkmenistan’s\r\npolitical behaviour and its readiness to be an active Member\r\nof the Organization.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call\r\non the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic,\r\nMr. Jan Kavan.\r\nMr. Kavan (Czech Republic): By way of introduction,\r\nlet me congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President\r\nof the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly and\r\nwish you every success in the execution of your important\r\nfunctions. I would like to use this opportunity also to\r\nexpress thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of\r\nUruguay, for his responsible work and for the efforts he has\r\ndevoted to United Nations activities throughout the year.\r\nThe Czech Republic is very pleased that after five\r\nyears the Assembly again has an opportunity to welcome\r\nnew United Nations Members — Nauru, Kiribati and\r\nTonga. This further expansion of the United Nations family\r\nis evidence of its increasingly universal nature, which the\r\nCzech Republic unequivocally supports.\r\nThis year marks an important milestone for the Czech\r\nRepublic, which this past spring became a member of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), together with\r\nHungary and Poland. Recalling Article 1 of the Washington\r\nTreaty, which refers to the United Nations Charter and\r\ncommits its members to address international conflicts by\r\npeaceful means, we believe that this historic first\r\nenlargement of the Alliance following the end of the cold\r\nwar will contribute to the enhancement of stability and\r\nsecurity, and do so not only in our region. We support\r\nNATO’s continued enlargement through the inclusion of\r\nother countries, and we are convinced that this first step\r\nwill also have a motivating and mobilizing character for\r\nthem.\r\nNATO’s new strategic concept emphasizes its broad\r\napproach to security issues; it envisages the necessity of\r\nnot only facing military risks but also of monitoring\r\neconomic, social, environmental and political issues that\r\nmay disrupt security and stability. NATO has\r\ndemonstrated that it has both the functional mechanisms\r\nfor crisis management and the capacities to manage\r\nhumanitarian crises. However, there is an obvious need\r\nfor the Alliance’s potential to be fully utilized by an\r\neffective cooperation with the United Nations, which has\r\nthe ability to oversee the restoration of civil\r\nadministration and infrastructure. It is this close\r\ncooperation that underlines the fact that our commitment\r\nto peace is as strong as our will to challenge gross\r\nviolations of human rights by military means. And, of\r\ncourse, the concept of regional security in Europe cannot\r\nbe imagined without NATO’s cooperating also with the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the Western European Union or the Council of\r\nEurope.\r\nBecause development in Europe is profoundly\r\ninfluenced by ever-deeper integration, the successful\r\ncompletion of the long-term process of our country’s\r\nentry into the European Union is currently the highest-\r\npriority goal for Czech foreign policy. Having started\r\naccession talks in the spring of last year, the Czech\r\nRepublic is promoting political dialogue with the\r\nEuropean Union member States and associated countries.\r\nThrough our active involvement in the Common Foreign\r\nand Security Policy, we are assuming our share of\r\nresponsibility for development in Europe and the world,\r\nobviously, to date, within the restrictive framework of our\r\nstatus as an associated country. We attach major\r\nimportance to the social and environmental dimensions of\r\nEuropean integration. We are fully aware that the\r\nimportance of these dimensions will continue to increase\r\nin order to keep up with the advancement of\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe disintegration of the bipolar world has brought\r\nabout a transition from confrontation to cooperation given\r\nrise to efforts to create a new security architecture, and\r\nled to integration processes, particularly on the European\r\ncontinent. However, it has also brought about the\r\nresurgence of dormant threats and the emergence of new\r\ncentres of instability. The Kosovo tragedy and other crises\r\nhave brought us closer to recognizing the importance of\r\nthe principle of the personal security of human beings and\r\nits guarantees as a precondition of peace and security in\r\nthe world. The fact that the worst atrocities, which have\r\nnothing in common with the civilized world, are still\r\n46\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nbeing committed at the end of the twentieth century makes\r\nthis recognition all the more sad and alarming. In this\r\ncontext, the Czech Republic would express its appreciation\r\nand support for the work of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Former Yugoslavia. The Czech Republic is convinced\r\nthat the international community’s efforts should result in\r\njust punishment for all the atrocities committed.\r\nThe United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Foreign\r\nand Commonwealth Affairs, Robin Cook, correctly argued\r\nhere that we must counter the culture of impunity. All\r\ncriminals should be held to account. As Secretary- General\r\nKofi Annan said, massive and systematic violations of\r\nhuman rights should not be allowed to stand, wherever they\r\nmay take place.\r\nKosovo will be the benchmark for the success\r\nachieved by international institutions. Kosovo is now in a\r\nperiod when it is necessary to defend peace, a period in\r\nwhich to achieve political stability and democratization,\r\neconomic stabilization and a gradual development of the\r\nregion. The Czech Republic is interested in the region’s\r\nstability in all respects. That is why it participated, in its\r\ncapacity as the currently presiding country of the Central\r\nEuropean Initiative, in the Stability Pact Summit meeting at\r\nSarajevo and why it will be working towards\r\ndemocratization, economic reconstruction and security in\r\nthe region. We are, of course, fully aware that this is far\r\neasier said than done. The obstacles on the road are\r\nnumerous and enormous.\r\nThe United Nations plays an irreplaceable role in\r\nproviding for international peace and security. The peaceful\r\nresolution of disputes will undoubtedly continue to be one\r\nof the main priorities of the United Nations. The Czech\r\nRepublic therefore attaches great importance to the use of\r\npeacekeeping operations in dealing with crisis situations and\r\nsupports the efforts directed towards their greater efficiency,\r\nparticularly as regards their rapid deployment. Speed\r\nappears to be the key aspect in many cases. However, the\r\nUnited Nations must also have adequate funding to carry\r\nout this demanding role effectively; unfortunately, its\r\nfinancial resources are considerably limited at present\r\nbecause of the fact that some Member States fail to honour\r\ntheir financial obligations. The United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has been\r\nmarked by these problems: the Mission was not financially\r\nsecured to the degree which would have corresponded with\r\nthe security situation at hand and with the very difficult\r\ntask of restoring the civil administration in Kosovo. On the\r\nother hand, it was probably the most rapidly deployed\r\nmission in the history of the United Nations.\r\nThe importance of UNMIK is shown by the fact\r\nthat, as the highest civilian authority in Kosovo, it\r\ncoordinates activities of international regional\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The\r\nCzech Republic greatly appreciates the positive\r\ncooperation between UNMIK and KFOR, although it is\r\nevident that the international security forces cannot in the\r\nlong term replace civilian administration and police\r\nforces.\r\nA major degree of responsibility lies on the\r\nshoulders of the United Nations, and especially on those\r\nof the Secretary-General’s Special Representative, Mr.\r\nBernard Kouchner, in Kosovo. I had an opportunity to get\r\nto know his difficult task at first hand during my visit to\r\nPristina a few days ago. The Secretary-General’s Special\r\nRepresentative needs the full support of the international\r\ncommunity in his efforts, including the transformation of\r\nthe UCK into a non-military Kosovo protection corps.\r\nThe Czech Republic obviously supports all steps and\r\nmeasures which may bring about the establishment of a\r\ndemocratic and multi-ethnic society in Kosovo as\r\nstipulated by the Washington North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) Summit. Unfortunately, during my\r\nstay in Kosovo I did not come across any convincing\r\nevidence that that vision could really be implemented in\r\nany foreseeable future — just the contrary. The\r\ndiminishing number of Serbs in Kosovo, the continuous\r\nthreats of murder — even to very old Serbian ladies —\r\nthe rising influence of a mafia, which Mr. Kouchner told\r\nme about, the ever-present spirit of revenge, the lack of\r\ntrained police forces, the absence of local civil\r\nadministration, the disease of corruption and rivalry\r\nbetween different sectors of the Kosovo Albanians are\r\njust some of the obstacles which have to be dealt with\r\ndecisively in order to prevent the vision of the future\r\nfrom becoming nothing but a never-fulfilled dream.\r\nI wholeheartedly agree with the Secretary-General’s\r\nunequivocal statement that commitment to humanitarian\r\naction must be universal if it is to be legitimate. This\r\nmeans not only that our commitment to peace and\r\nstability cannot end with the cessation of hostilities but\r\nthat we have to be seen to be objective and even-handed\r\ntowards all ethnic groups, as well as towards all regions.\r\nI am glad to note that the recent argument that “East\r\nTimor is not Kosovo” was quietly dropped. The\r\nSecretary-General has said that humanity, after all, is\r\nindivisible; we have to wholeheartedly agree with him.\r\nThe Czech Republic intends to continue its\r\ninvolvement in peace operations under the leadership of\r\n47\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nboth the United Nations and regional organizations, as\r\nborne out by, among other actions, the operation of Czech\r\nunits under NATO command in Bosnia and Herzegovina as\r\nwell as in Kosovo. The first Czech policemen should arrive\r\nin Kosovo to join the UNMIK police force within the next\r\nfive days. The number of police necessary to maintain civil\r\norder in Kosovo is now more than double the figure\r\noriginally estimated, Mr. Kouchner told me. Police officials,\r\nnot the military, are trained to investigate murders or, even\r\nmore importantly, to take measures to prevent murders or\r\nother grave challenges to law and order. The Czech\r\nRepublic is also prepared to consider sending military\r\nobservers to the United Nations peace missions in Sierra\r\nLeone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, of\r\ncourse, following a recent request we received from\r\nAustralia and the agreement on the Security Council\r\nmandate, also to East Timor.\r\nThe Czech Republic is concerned about the\r\ndevelopments in East Timor. We welcome the fact that\r\nafter decades, the people of East Timor were given an\r\nopportunity to implement their right to self-determination,\r\nand we feel very shocked that the results of the referendum\r\nled to bloodshed and indiscriminate killings. Indonesia’s\r\nacceptance of the United Nations military peacekeeping\r\nforces has made us confident that the United Nations will\r\nsucceed in ensuring peace in that area.\r\nPeace and security in crisis-ridden areas are also\r\nclosely related to humanitarian relief, which is provided as\r\na rule to afflicted civilian populations. A radical\r\ndeterioration in the security situation may cause a\r\ndevastating humanitarian crisis, as we have seen in Kosovo.\r\nHere, too, there is a need to look at the possibilities of\r\nsimplifying the United Nations decision-making\r\nmechanisms. It is disturbing that, for example, the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees did\r\nnot have sufficient resources and capacities to tackle the\r\nhumanitarian crisis in that region, which was due mainly to\r\nsomewhat rigid procedures.\r\nOne of the most important tasks of the international\r\ncommunity is undoubtedly to prevent the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and to eliminate them\r\ncompletely. Our aim is still a world without any nuclear\r\nweapons. With regard to the forthcoming Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to be held in\r\nthe year 2000, the Czech Republic calls for overcoming the\r\nstagnation in negotiations on the relevant treaties supporting\r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and for developing\r\nmore positive attitudes, particularly on the part of nuclear\r\ncountries, which will create a more favourable atmosphere\r\nin the disarmament process and lead to the adoption of\r\nclear, practical and implementable nuclear disarmament\r\nmeasures in the new millennium.\r\nThere is no question but that early ratification of the\r\nSTART II Treaty between the United States and Russia\r\nwould help considerably to revive the disarmament\r\nprocess. We consider the achievement of universal\r\napplicability of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and their speedy\r\nratification a very urgent task. In this respect, we\r\nparticularly appreciate the CTBT ratification by France\r\nand by the United Kingdom. The Czech Republic hopes\r\nthat the conference of CTBT countries, to be held at\r\nVienna in October this year, will help to accelerate\r\nratification in other countries.\r\nWe welcome efforts to improve the effectiveness of\r\nthe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons, and we continue to express our support for\r\nearly negotiation of a verification protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)\r\nand Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.\r\nRegarding conventional arms, the Czech Republic\r\nsupports all measures that contribute to greater\r\ntransparency. It consistently fulfils its obligations to notify\r\nthe relevant registers and supports the efforts for an\r\nexpansion of their procedures which would cover\r\nadditional types of weapons. The Czech Republic also\r\nfully shares the international community’s grave concern\r\nover illegal transfers of hand-held and light weapons, and\r\nsupports all measures required to stop such activities. In\r\nthe context of the international efforts to limit and ban the\r\nuse of anti-personnel landmines, I can inform the\r\nAssembly with satisfaction that, following last year’s\r\nratification of Protocol II to the Convention on\r\nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\r\nConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be\r\nExcessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects,\r\nthe Czech Republic has completed the process of ratifying\r\nthe Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction and will soon deposit our\r\nratification instrument with the Secretary-General. We\r\nsupport all efforts towards achieving universal\r\napplicability of that Convention. We continue to be\r\ninvolved in international activities focused on demining\r\nand on providing help to landmine victims.\r\n48\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThe Czech Republic welcomed the enlargement of the\r\nConference on Disarmament by another five countries, to\r\nwhich I extend warm congratulations. At the same time we\r\nexpress our hope that the Conference on Disarmament will\r\nsucceed in overcoming the current stagnation and will start\r\ntalks not only on a treaty banning the production of fissile\r\nmaterials for military purposes but also on other topical\r\nproblems of arms control and disarmament, including\r\nnuclear disarmament, and on security guarantees for non-\r\nnuclear countries.\r\nThere is no doubt that this year has been a real test for\r\nthe United Nations, as well as a critical test of transnational\r\ndecision-making during crises. This test, so crucial for the\r\nfuture of the United Nations, has not yet been concluded\r\nand properly evaluated. It is not only Kosovo that has\r\nrevealed that the United Nations in its present form does\r\nnot make full use of its potential to be an irreplaceable\r\nvehicle for achieving the goals set out in the Charter. At the\r\nthreshold of the third millennium, the Organization\r\ntherefore looks for an answer to the question of how the\r\ninternational community can become a truly responsible\r\ncommunity and what role the United Nations will play in\r\nthis process.\r\nIn our view, the United Nations must first of all\r\nrespond to the changed substance of conflicts in today’s\r\nworld. These are not classical conflicts between States but,\r\nin most cases, internal conflicts rather similar to civil wars.\r\nThe United Nations and the international community in\r\ngeneral face the need to clearly define the relationship\r\nbetween national sovereignty and the protection of human\r\nrights and ultimately to engage in a discussion on how they\r\nshould support sensible civilian Governments that keep\r\narmed forces under control. In this context, we should\r\nclearly focus on the Secretary-General’s argument about\r\nindividual sovereignty and the right of every individual to\r\ncontrol his or her own destiny.\r\nSecondly, the urgency of a radical acceleration of the\r\nprocess of United Nations reform, particularly reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, is becoming increasingly evident. The\r\nCzech Republic fully supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nreform efforts, and I would like to share the optimism\r\nconcerning early substantial progress in reform negotiations\r\nwhich Mr. Annan expressed to me during our talks in\r\nPrague last July. I have to admit that we consider the\r\nresults of this year’s negotiations, especially those on\r\nSecurity Council reform, to be inadequate. This, of course,\r\ncorresponds to the role of the United Nations during the\r\ninitial stages of the Kosovo conflict. The composition of the\r\nSecurity Council requires change. The Czech Republic\r\nbelieves that the number of both permanent and non-\r\npermanent members of the Security Council needs to be\r\nincreased, while representation of developing countries\r\nhas to be strengthened.\r\nThirdly, conflict-prevention mechanisms need to be\r\ncreated, and attention should be devoted to questions such\r\nas discrimination, poverty, access to raw materials and the\r\narms trade. The arms trade does not include only\r\nextensive, elaborate weapons systems. It is the excessive\r\naccumulation of hand-held and other small arms which\r\nabove all requires our tough response, because these\r\npersonal weapons play a key role in most conflicts. I\r\nwould like to express my full support for the call by the\r\nUnited Kingdom Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, to halt\r\nthe illegal trade in small arms. Cooperation with regional\r\norganizations such as the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe and the Organization of African\r\nUnity, which may be more successful in dealing with\r\nconflicts, should also play a role in preventing conflicts.\r\nI very much welcome the Secretary-General’s emphasis\r\nhere on moving from a culture of reaction to a culture of\r\nprevention.\r\nFourthly, the role of the United Nations in the area\r\nof human rights and as part of a broader concept of\r\nhuman security should be considerably intensified. We\r\nwelcomed the Secretary-General’s personal statement in\r\nhis address at this year’s session of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights, in which he said, “I have made human\r\nrights a priority in every United Nations programme”.\r\nThis, it seems to me, accurately reflects the importance\r\nwhich the United Nations should give human rights issues\r\nin the future. The United Nations should ensure that the\r\nuniversal nature of human rights is accepted and projected\r\nas a leading principle for the conduct of the international\r\ncommunity. By our joint efforts we should guarantee a\r\ndignified and complete life for every individual in the\r\nnext millennium. It is unacceptable at the threshold of the\r\nnew millennium to claim that human rights are relative\r\nand that their violation by sovereign States on their own\r\nterritory is solely their internal affair and as such may not\r\nbe a subject of interest to other members of the\r\ninternational community. If the United Nations were\r\nunable publicly to defend the existence of human rights,\r\nit would be unable to defend its own existence.\r\nAt the same time, let us not forget the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s warning about the need to ensure universal\r\nlegitimacy, which he issued in connection with the\r\nbombing campaign against Yugoslavia. Incidentally, the\r\nnew Czech Government has adopted a foreign policy\r\n49\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nconcept which regards human rights as one of its main\r\npillars and which at the same time stresses the desirability\r\nof United Nations mandates for peace-enforcing operations.\r\nFifthly, it is in the vital interest of the United Nations\r\nfor the world to step into the twenty-first century under the\r\nrule of law in international relations. The situation in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, including developments in Kosovo,\r\nclearly shows the extremely important role already played\r\ntoday by international judicial bodies in enhancing the\r\nprestige of international law and its gradual integration into\r\nthe political decision-making processes. The implementation\r\nof international law by the United Nations international\r\njudicial bodies has considerable positive influence on how\r\nglobal public opinion perceives the United Nations itself.\r\nLet me now touch briefly on one more serious\r\nproblem. Recent earthquakes in Turkey, Greece and Taiwan\r\nhave underlined the need for the world to be prepared to\r\nprovide coordinated help to an area hit by a massive natural\r\ndisaster. This experience should, in our view, lead to the\r\nfurther strengthening and deepening of the idea already\r\npresented some time ago, namely, the idea of the “White\r\nHelmets”. The challenge is to extend “White Helmets“ into\r\nregular international rescue forces under United Nations\r\nleadership, capable of coordinated action on the spot —\r\nnaturally, with the consent of the countries receiving such\r\nassistance. The ultimate goal could be the formation of rapid-\r\nresponse international forces, formed of national\r\ncontingents and permanently available, well-equipped expert\r\ngroups which could be dispatched to the stricken area in a\r\nmatter of minutes or hours.\r\nIn conclusion, let us remind ourselves once again that\r\nthe future of the United Nations is primarily a matter of the\r\npolitical will of its Member States. Finding answers to the\r\nquestions which have been raised at this year’s session of\r\nthe General Assembly is therefore not only up to the United\r\nNations, but up to the entire international community. The\r\nMillennium Assembly should give us a major opportunity\r\nfor finding answers to these questions. I also hope that the\r\nMillennium Assembly will contribute decisively to the\r\nacceleration of work on the United Nations reforms, the\r\nneed for which was so clearly highlighted by the Kosovo\r\ncrisis. I am sure that the recovery of the commitment to\r\nmultilateralism and to the leading United Nations role in the\r\nstruggle to uphold basic Charter values, such as democracy,\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law, is now in sight.\r\nMy traditionally cautious optimism was, I admit,\r\nslightly strengthened in this respect by listening here to\r\nsome politicians representing countries with far more\r\nresources than the Czech Republic has at its disposal. Our\r\nresources are, unfortunately, fairly limited. Nevertheless,\r\nwe will continue to support the United Nations and, as I\r\nhave said, to participate in its missions to pour millions\r\nof dollars into humanitarian and development aid, and so\r\non. The point I wish to make clear in this speech, even so\r\nlate in the evening, is that we will always be ready to\r\nhelp.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I call on\r\nthe representative of Pakistan, who wishes to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind delegations that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and 5 minutes for the second intervention and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Haque: I am taking the floor to respond to the\r\nstatement made by the Foreign Minister of India earlier\r\nthis evening, wherein he accused Pakistan of compulsive\r\nhostility towards his country. This statement is as\r\ndisingenuous as it is hypocritical. In the light of history,\r\nit would be difficult, if not impossible, to be misled by\r\nIndian protestations of its pious intentions towards its\r\nneighbours.\r\nSince its independence, Indian ambitions in the\r\nregion and beyond, its proclivity for resorting to the use\r\nof force and its hegemonic and expansionist policies have\r\nbeen amply demonstrated on numerous occasions. To\r\nrecap briefly, since its independence, India has occupied\r\na number of territories by the use of force. I refer to the\r\nterritories of Hyderabad, Junagadh, the Portugese\r\nterritories of Goa, the Kingdom of Sikkim, Jammu and\r\nKashmir and India’s repeated aggression and imposed\r\nwars against Pakistan.\r\nIndian ambitions have also impelled it to acquire\r\nnuclear weapons, thus plunging South Asia into a nuclear\r\narms race. Pakistan’s compulsion is to defend itself, to\r\ndefend its sovereignty, to defend its territorial integrity\r\nand to defend its independence, since Pakistan has\r\nsuffered the brunt of Indian aggression and has once been\r\ndismembered as a result of that aggression.\r\nThe Foreign Minister of India also referred to\r\nJammu and Kashmir as the very core of Indian\r\nnationhood. If this indeed is the core of Indian\r\nnationhood, it must be a rotten core, because this core is\r\nbuilt on the denial of the right of self-determination of the\r\n50\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir, pledged by India to the\r\ninternational community, to the Security Council and to the\r\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nMost of the nations represented in this body have\r\nacquired nationhood and independence as a result of the\r\nexercise of this inalienable right. No core of nationhood can\r\nbe built on the denial of this basic right. If Jammu and\r\nKashmir is the core of Indian nationhood, it is built on the\r\nviolation and open flouting of the resolutions of the United\r\nNations Security Council — incidentally, the very body in\r\nwhich India aspires to achieve a permanent seat — as well\r\nas of international law and morality.\r\nIf this is the core of Indian nationhood, it is built on\r\nmassive repression, on murder, on arson, on the rape of\r\nwomen — since in Jammu and Kashmir in the last decade\r\nalone more than 60,000 innocent people have been\r\nmurdered, thousands of women have been raped, entire\r\nvillages have been burnt to the ground. No nation can pride\r\nitself on having a core that is based on these despicable\r\nactions. If this is indeed the core of Indian nationhood, the\r\nless said about it the better.\r\nThe facts of the Jammu and Kashmir situation are that\r\nJammu and Kashmir is not a part of India and never has\r\nbeen a part of India. There are Security Council resolutions\r\npledging to the Kashmiri people their right to self-\r\ndetermination. These were accepted by India. The people of\r\nJammu and Kashmir have boycotted the most recent\r\nelections and earlier elections, the sham elections held by\r\nIndia. They have not participated in those elections in order\r\nto show their alienation and rejection of Indian rule.\r\nThere are more than 700,000 Indian soldiers and\r\nparamilitary forces engaged in efforts to quell the struggle\r\nof the Kashmiri people and to break their spirit through\r\nmassive violations of their human rights, murders,\r\natrocities, repression, custodial deaths and the destruction of\r\nKashmir’s economy. All this has been documented by\r\ninternational human rights organizations, such as Asia\r\nWatch, Amnesty International and a host of others,\r\nincluding some within India itself.\r\nThe Foreign Minister of India also referred to Kargil.\r\nKargil was a manifestation of the continuing struggle of the\r\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir to achieve their right to self-\r\ndetermination. Until such time as the Kashmiri people\r\nachieve their right to self-determination, their struggle will\r\ncontinue.\r\nThe Foreign Minister also took it upon himself to\r\naccuse Pakistan of torturing some Indian soldiers or\r\nkilling them while they were in captivity. There could be\r\nno worse falsehood than this one. Pakistan abides by\r\ninternational law. It neither tortured nor killed any Indian\r\nsoldier. It did not have to do so.\r\nIn the face of these false Indian accusations, we\r\nhave now resorted to the practice of inviting International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross personnel to observe the\r\nhanding over of any Indian soldiers who are imprisoned\r\nby Pakistan or captured by Pakistan when they cross over\r\ninto our territory.\r\nThe Foreign Minister of India also talked about\r\ninternational terrorism. It is odd that he should have done\r\nso since it is India that has written the book on the\r\npractice of State-sponsored terrorism. India’s State-\r\nsponsored terrorism against the Kashmiri people is well\r\ndocumented. India’s State-sponsored terrorism against\r\nPakistan has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people,\r\nin random violence — all in an effort to break the spirit\r\nof the people, to sow divisions among them. And we have\r\nconfessions of hundreds of Indian agents attesting to this\r\nfact.\r\nPious sentiments about democracy and pluralism do\r\nnot mean anything unless they are put into practice. India\r\nis a country that talks of peace and builds nuclear\r\narsenals. India is a country that talks of peace at the\r\nUnited Nations while it makes unremitting war on the\r\ninnocent people of Jammu and Kashmir for having dared\r\nto ask for their right to self-determination.\r\n51\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 22 September 1999\r\nThe path to peace is indeed open. Pakistan has all\r\nalong offered India a dialogue, a results-oriented dialogue.\r\nWe call upon India to take the first step on this path\r\nby ending its repression in Kashmir and entering into a\r\ndialogue with Pakistan, to find a just solution to the Jammu\r\nand Kashmir problem in accordance with the wishes of its\r\npeople, as well as to all other outstanding issues between\r\nour countries.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.05 p.m.\r\n52\r\n"
