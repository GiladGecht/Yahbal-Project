(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Patrick Leclercq, Prime\r\nMinister, Minister of State and Director for\r\nExternal Relations of the Principality of\r\nMonaco\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister, Minister of State and\r\nDirector for External Relations of the Principality of\r\nMonaco.\r\nMr. Patrick Leclercq, Prime Minister, Minister of\r\nState and Director for External Relations of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister, Minister of State and\r\nDirector for External Relations of the Principality of\r\nMonaco, His Excellency Mr. Patrick Leclercq, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Leclercq (Monaco) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme, first of all, to congratulate you most warmly, Mr.\r\nPresident, on your election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Allow me\r\nalso to express the conviction that under your authority\r\nour work will be conducted with the same high level of\r\nvision and competence demonstrated by the President\r\nof your country, Ms. Tarja Halonen, in her\r\nCo-Chairpersonship of the Millennium Summit at the\r\nside of the President of Namibia, Mr. Sam Nujoma. I\r\nalso extend my thanks and congratulations to the\r\nSecretary-General, who continues to imbue the\r\ninternational Organization and the entire international\r\nstaff he commands with the virtues of rigour,\r\nmoderation and integrity that he embodies in his\r\nservice to the great ideals of the Organization.\r\nThose are the same ideals that have just been\r\nreaffirmed by the Heads of State and Government.\r\nThey also reaffirmed their confidence in the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations to ensure the advancement of, and\r\nrespect for, those ideals so long as the international\r\ncommunity gives the Organization the necessary\r\nsupport through a renewed commitment.\r\nFor a small State such as Monaco, nothing is\r\nmore important than such a reaffirmation of the ideals\r\nthat should govern relations between sovereign States\r\nin a spirit of equality and dignity. It is not a question of\r\ndisregarding the profound differences that may exist\r\nbetween States with regard to their objective\r\ncharacteristics, influence or weight in the affairs of the\r\nworld. However, it is appropriate to reaffirm the fact\r\nthat, no matter how small, each State should enjoy the\r\nright to respect, and that all States are be bound by the\r\nsame rules in conducting international affairs.\r\nIts history of over seven centuries makes it\r\npossible for Monaco to gauge what that reaffirmation\r\nrepresents, a reaffirmation supported by the common\r\ndetermination of all States represented here. For its\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\npart, the Principality associates itself fully with the\r\nimpetus provided by the Millennium Summit. To the\r\nextent it is able, Monaco intends to contribute to\r\ndeveloping the full potential of that impetus.\r\nAllow me, before I touch on the principal issues\r\nwe will be dealing with at this session  in which\r\nMonaco has a longstanding interest  to address a\r\ntopic that seems to require some clarification: the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco itself.\r\nThough the notoriety enjoyed by the Principality\r\nseems well established, since the whole world has\r\nheard of it, all too often people have a one-sided view\r\nof it in which it is reduced to a set of appealing but\r\nvaguely archaic clichés.\r\nMany people still believe that the casino is the\r\nmain source of income for the State, while in fact the\r\nassessment paid by the Societé des Bains de Mer,\r\nwhich manages the casino, yields only 4 per cent of\r\npublic revenue. The rest derives primarily from taxes\r\nand income from public property. In truth, the structure\r\nof our budget is not very different from that of any\r\nother country. As concerns expenses, many might envy\r\nus, as we are able each year to devote a third of our\r\nresources to investing in civil engineering projects.\r\nMany people also believe that we depend to a\r\nlarge extent on tourism. We are pleased, of course, that\r\nMonaco attracts about 6 million visitors a year. But\r\nhere again reality contradicts the image of a tourism-\r\ndependent economy, because tourism accounts for only\r\n10 per cent of the principalitys revenues. Of the rest,\r\n40 per cent  are the product of local or international\r\ncommerce, 20 per cent of banking activities, 10 percent\r\nof industrial activities  emanating from about 100\r\nhigh-technology, non-polluting companies  and the\r\nrest derive from a variety of services.\r\nClearly, Monaco, rather than being a sort of old-\r\nstyle paradise for a happy few, has all the\r\ncharacteristics of a highly developed country.\r\nIn this connection, we must also note to what\r\nextent the Principality provides jobs in the region.\r\nThough Monaco has 30,000 residents, it has 38,000\r\nworkers, some 30,000 of which live outside of Monaco\r\nand commute to the Principality every day, which\r\nenables them and their families to enjoy the same\r\nsocial benefits and educational, sports and medical\r\namenities as the people of Monaco themselves.\r\nMonaco is undoubtedly a small country, but it\r\ndoes not live in the past. On the contrary, we have a\r\nbroad and modern outlook, and it is this vision that has\r\nenabled us to become a highly developed State that use\r\nstate-of-the-art technology and is involved in massive\r\nprojects, such as the one that has enabled us to build\r\nout over the sea and thus expand our territory by more\r\nthan 20 per cent during the reign of the current\r\nSovereign Prince.\r\nAlthough all of this is based on unarguable fact,\r\nsome still question the source of our prosperity. To our\r\nsurprise and indignation, we recently heard it said that\r\nthe Principality was too lenient with respect to certain\r\ncriminal activities. Quite the opposite: we have sought\r\nways and means of combating criminal activities and\r\nhave consistently reaffirmed our will to strengthen the\r\nmeasures we take to meet the challenges of today.\r\nAll foreign activities require Government\r\nauthorization, which is granted only following an in-\r\ndepth investigation. Nearly every week the\r\nGovernmental Council must veto certain projects. In\r\nthe area of banking and finance, monitoring systems\r\nhave been set up, and here we also rely on the help of\r\nour great friend and neighbour, France. The legislation\r\nin place to combat money-laundering is the same as\r\nthat in most developed countries. In fact, in certain\r\nareas, it is even more stringent.\r\nMonaco has set up an information and monitoring\r\nservice on financial flows to allow for the involvement\r\nof legal authorities when necessary and for the\r\nexchange of information with the equivalent foreign\r\ninstitutions. The Principality is in no way a laissez-\r\nfaire zone in which all types of wealth can be\r\naccumulated. Nor can it be termed an opaque\r\nfinancial venue, unless we believe that transparency\r\ndoes not exist anywhere.\r\nSome see Monaco as a kind of fiscal paradise, as\r\nif we had attempted to create artificial mechanisms to\r\nattract floating capital and wealthy people trying to\r\navoid taxation in their own countries. The truth is that\r\ndirect taxation was abolished in 1869, at a time when\r\nthere was no tax on the income of natural persons\r\nanywhere in the world, and thus competition could not\r\nhave been an issue. The fact that this situation\r\ncontinues to prevail today certainly places Monaco\r\namong the countries having soft tax laws. But there\r\nare, in fact, taxes: two-thirds of the countrys income\r\nemanates from direct or indirect fiscal contributions,\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nthat is to say, the value-added tax and the tax on the\r\nprofits realized from commercial, industrial and\r\nintellectual activities.\r\nIn sum, Monaco is a highly developed country\r\nthat wishes to be an active participant in the European\r\nsphere and that observes all international commitments\r\nto combat present-day scourges such as financial\r\ncriminality and money laundering, which pose a clear\r\nthreat to the equilibrium of financial systems. The\r\nPrincipality is, by its very nature, supportive of its\r\nenvironment, but this is also the will of leadership.\r\nI now turn to the basis of its external activities,\r\nwhich also reflect its status as a small State focusing on\r\na few areas in which its tradition, experience and\r\nabilities can provide added value at the international\r\nlevel.\r\nOne of our priorities has always been\r\nhumanitarian action and social development. This was\r\nmade clear when, on 26 June last, His Serene Highness\r\nthe Hereditary Prince of Monaco, signed, in the\r\npresence of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, the two Optional Protocols to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, on the\r\ninvolvement of children in armed conflict and on the\r\nsale of children, child prostitution and child\r\npornography.\r\nThe actions taken in relation to the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development will be followed up during the\r\nspecial session to review the achievement of the goals\r\nof the World Summit for Children, to be held next year.\r\nWe expect that session effectively to address the issue\r\nof the protection of children, who are always the first\r\namong the civilian population to suffer in time of war.\r\nThe Principality also wishes to contribute to\r\ndevelopment at the public level as well as in terms of\r\nthe non-governmental organizations, which are very\r\nactive in Monaco, where they receive the strong\r\nsupport of all those who feel themselves morally\r\nobligated to contribute to the activities undertaken in a\r\nspirit of solidarity by a country that allows them to lead\r\na privileged life. We expect from the upcoming\r\nConference on the fight against poverty in the least\r\ndeveloped countries, to be held next May, and in\r\nparticular from the 10-year review of the outcome of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, known as Rio + 10, a new impetus for\r\ninternational cooperation in these areas so vital to the\r\nfuture of humanity, in which progress is currently\r\nlagging.\r\nIt goes without saying that environmental issues,\r\nincluding in particular those relating to the marine\r\nenvironment, have always been priority concerns for\r\nMonaco, situated as it is on the Mediterranean coast.\r\nWe will continue to follow up on these activities and to\r\ntake initiatives along the lines of those we have been\r\npromoting.\r\nI can only reaffirm the role that the Principality\r\nplays in all relevant forums to intensify the struggle\r\nagainst the severe scourges of our times, such as\r\nterrorism, trafficking in drugs and in human beings,\r\nand the illegal financial flows which they create or\r\nsustain.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing the hope that I\r\nhave been able to provide a clearer view of the\r\nsituation in present-day Monaco, a situation of\r\ncontrasts. Monaco is one of the smallest countries in\r\nthe world, but at the same time one of the most highly\r\ndeveloped. It is an anachronism for those with an\r\nunrealistic or prejudiced view, but its economic\r\nstructures reflect great modernity and dynamism. Its\r\nimage may be identified with play and leisure, but the\r\nfact is that it creates jobs well beyond its borders. It is\r\nviewed as a curiosity, yet it remains an acknowledged\r\nsovereign State, as proved by its participation in the\r\nprincipal international organizations and by the fact\r\nthat its voice is heard in areas where its contribution\r\ndeserves to be taken into account.\r\nI could continue that list of contradictions, but I\r\nthink those are sufficient to provide a key to what His\r\nSerene Highness Prince Rainier III said when he\r\nopened the fabulous new Grimaldi Forum  a\r\nconference and cultural centre in Monaco  in\r\nsummarizing the inspiration that has always sustained\r\nhis dynasty and the Principality over the centuries:\r\nOne does not need a great territory to have great\r\ndreams, or a great number of people to make\r\nthem come true.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister\r\nof State and Director for External Relations of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nMr. Patrick Leclercq, Prime Minister, Minister of\r\nState and Director for External Relations of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, President of\r\nthe Togolese Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Togolese Republic.\r\nMr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, President of the\r\nTogolese Republic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Togolese Republic, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Eyadema (spoke in French): Before\r\ndiscussing some of the concerns of the African\r\ncontinent and our views on some of the problems\r\nfacing the United Nations, I should like at the outset to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on having been chosen\r\nto guide the work of our world body at this important\r\nsession. The high office to which you have risen in\r\nyour country, Finland, and the major role that Finland\r\nplays in the world constitute a guarantee that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is truly in good hands.\r\nI wish also to pay tribute to our brother the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose ability and\r\ndedication we highly appreciate.\r\nThe General Assembly session that took place 40\r\nyears ago was seen as the session of Africa. It was at\r\nthat session that many newly independent African\r\ncountries participated in the work of United Nations\r\nbodies for the first time as States Members of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nYet despite the progress our continent has made\r\nover the past 40 years, Africa continues to be\r\nweakened by the ills of underdevelopment. Today, 33\r\nof the worlds 48 least developed countries are African\r\ncountries. In other words, three fifths of the States of\r\nour continent belong to that group of countries that are\r\nlagging behind in the pursuit of development.\r\nAs the worlds least developed region, Africa\r\nsuffers from a number of specific ills which hamper its\r\ngrowth and for which it is important that the\r\ninternational community help provide a substantial,\r\neffective remedy. Here I would first mention two\r\npandemics that ravage the continent and whose human\r\nand economic consequences are particularly severe and\r\nalarming: AIDS and malaria. We are most grateful for\r\nthe initiative taken last January by the Security Council\r\nto consider the question of AIDS in Africa. More\r\nrecently, the Thirteenth International AIDS\r\nConference, held at Durban, South Africa, took stock\r\nof the situation regarding the advance of the epidemic\r\nand of possible ways to control it. Members are\r\nundoubtedly aware that 70 per cent of the 34 million to\r\n35 million AIDS sufferers worldwide live in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, and that in some African countries\r\nschools have been closed because of the ravages of\r\nAIDS among the teachers.\r\nIn a number of countries the skilled workforce\r\nhas been considerably reduced by AIDS. The number\r\nof orphans in many countries affected by this epidemic\r\nis relatively high, thus exacerbating the economic and\r\nsocial situation of those countries. Therefore, it is\r\nessential that the international community rapidly and\r\ngenuinely mobilize in order to help the African\r\ncontinent control AIDS and eliminate its ravaging\r\neffects.\r\nWith respect to malaria, a special summit of\r\nheads of State and Government of the countries\r\nconcerned was held on 24-25 April in Abuja, Nigeria,\r\nwhere a plan of action was adopted to combat the\r\ndisease. Malaria kills one person somewhere in the\r\nworld every 30 seconds. The Assembly of Heads of\r\nState and Government of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), meeting in Lomé from 10-12 July this\r\nyear, appealed to the United Nations to proclaim the\r\nperiod 2001-2010 the decade to combat malaria. We\r\nfirmly hope that this Assembly will respond positively\r\nto our appeal, at this session, taking the necessary\r\nmeasures to ensure the decades success.\r\nThe African debt problem was also of concern to\r\nthe OAU Heads of State and Government at the Lomé\r\nsummit. At a session more than 12 years ago, the\r\nAfrican countries adopted a common position on the\r\nAfrican foreign debt crisis. Unfortunately, our\r\ncontinent continues to be the region of the world where\r\nthe debt burden is heaviest. As the General Assembly\r\nnoted last year in resolution 54/202,\r\nthe continuing debt and debt-servicing problems\r\nof heavily indebted developing countries\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nare one of the factors that hinder their development and\r\neconomic growth. This finding should motivate the\r\ninternational community, especially the developed\r\ncountries and international financial institutions, to\r\ntake more courageous measures, such as the outright\r\ncancellation of the African countries debt. Such a\r\ndecision would greatly contribute to the success of the\r\nefforts of our countries, which have committed\r\nthemselves to implementing sustained programmes to\r\neradicate poverty.\r\nThat is why we strongly support the proposals of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who believes that the\r\nindustrialized countries should take a number of\r\nmeasures for the benefit of the African countries and\r\nother developing regions to ensure the possibility of\r\ntheir making significant progress in the new world\r\neconomy.\r\nThe African continent is grateful to the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) for its\r\ninvaluable assistance over many years, resulting in the\r\ncarrying out of numerous projects. However, the\r\ncontinuous decline in UNDP resources worries us,\r\nbecause it affects our development prospects.\r\nAt a more global level, we note that major\r\ntransnational companies, which play a crucial role in\r\nthe world economy, are remarkably absent from United\r\nNations economic forums. As in the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO), where representatives of\r\nGovernments, employers and employees work together,\r\nit is desirable that in the Economic and Social Council\r\nrepresentatives of Governments should sit side by side\r\nwith those of multinational companies. That would\r\nenhance the effectiveness and impact of this important\r\nUnited Nations body. The international community, for\r\nits part, should prove, by decisive action, that it truly\r\nwishes to put an end to the suffering of the poorest\r\npeoples, the largest proportion of whom, unfortunately,\r\nare in Africa.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank President Bill\r\nClinton for having the United States Congress approve\r\na law making possible the establishment of a closer\r\npartnership between the United States of America and\r\nthe African States.\r\nI also welcome the convening in Cairo in April\r\nthis year of the first Africa-Europe summit. We place a\r\ngreat deal of hope in such meetings, which can only\r\nstrengthen the existing cooperation between the\r\nEuropean Union and the African countries.\r\nIt is well known that our continent is not afflicted\r\nsolely by the economic underdevelopment that puts it\r\nin last place in terms of the quality of life. It is also a\r\nregion of the world where numerous lethal conflicts\r\ncontinue to sow death and desolation. Consequently,\r\nAfrica accounts for the largest number of refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons. We are grateful to the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies,\r\nparticularly the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, for their assistance in\r\nhelping our continent to control various conflicts and\r\nmitigate their disastrous consequences.\r\nWe must recognize very sadly, however, that, by\r\ncomparison to other regions of the world that have also\r\nexperienced bloody conflicts, the attention that our\r\ncontinent receives from the international community is\r\nsomewhat meagre. We strongly urge the Security\r\nCouncil to demonstrate the same concern for us that it\r\nbestows on other regions of the world that have been\r\naffected by conflicts, inter alia, Europe and Asia.\r\nWe subscribe to the relevant recommendations\r\nmade by the Panel of experts which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has mandated to consider all problems related\r\nto the improved use of peace operations. We are of the\r\nview that the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions should be clear, credible and achievable.\r\nThese missions must be adequately financed and\r\nrapidly deployed where they are expected. They must\r\nbe capable of fulfilling their mandates successfully and\r\nable to defend themselves and control all those who\r\nwould seek to hinder their action on the ground.\r\nIn the area of peacekeeping in Africa, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has endowed\r\nitself over the years with valuable instruments for\r\nmanaging conflicts, such as the Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, the Conflict Management Centre\r\nand the Early Warning System. More than five years\r\nafter the creation of these mechanisms, we believe that\r\nthey should be complemented by the establishment of\r\nan operational and effective African peacekeeping\r\nforce. If such a force were created, it would discourage\r\nall subversive actions that underpin conflicts.\r\nThat is why I have proposed, with a view to\r\nstrengthening that force, the establishment of an\r\nAfrican institute for peace and conflict prevention, with\r\nthe assistance of the United Nations and the OAU. This\r\ninstitution would train African cadres in the art of\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nnegotiation, conflict management and the culture of\r\npeace.\r\nThe persistence of conflicts in Africa seriously\r\naffects the continents opportunities for development\r\nand hampers its efforts to achieve unity. It was with a\r\nview to remedying this situation that the heads of State\r\nand Government of the OAU decided in Syrte, Libya,\r\non 9 September 1999, to transform the OAU into a new\r\norganization to be known as the African Union. Its\r\nCharter was unanimously adopted at the 36th Assembly\r\nof Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at\r\nLomé last July. We are convinced that, with the birth of\r\nthe African Union, the continent will hasten its process\r\nof economic and political integration and strengthen\r\nthe peace and solidarity that are indispensable to\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe General Assembly was right to convene the\r\nMillennium Summit that was held here last week from\r\n6 to 8 September. That historic conference was held to\r\nconsider the role of the United Nations in the world at\r\nthe dawn of the twenty-first century. In my message to\r\nthe Millennium Summit, I stressed two basic problems.\r\nOne related to the activities of the United Nations in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe other concerned the stakes of development,\r\nparticularly in relation to Africa.\r\nWhen the Organization was established 55 years\r\nago, two thirds of its current Members did not exist as\r\nsovereign States and their peoples still lived under the\r\ncolonial yoke. The planet had a scant 2.5 billion\r\ninhabitants, as compared to 6 billion today. Despite the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council over the years, its\r\ncomposition has in truth remained virtually unchanged\r\nsince the establishment of the United Nations. To use\r\nthe words of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, this\r\ncomposition\r\ndoes not fully represent either the character or\r\nthe needs of our globalized world. (A/52/2000,\r\npara. 44)\r\nWe therefore think that it is high time to\r\nreconsider the composition of the Security Council,\r\nwith a view to admitting new permanent members\r\nselected from the new economic Powers that have\r\nemerged since the Second World War, to which would\r\nbe added regional Powers from the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThese are a few ideas that I wanted to contribute\r\nto this general debate.\r\nDespite its imperfections and shortcomings, I\r\nthink that the United Nations is irreplaceable, but we\r\nmust do everything possible to enhance its impact and\r\ninfluence.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore that the\r\nAfrican continent, despite its difficulties, continues to\r\nbe a region of great potential wealth; however, its\r\nresources have inadequately been inventoried,\r\ndeveloped and exploited.\r\nWe must not despair and think that Africa will not\r\novercome these difficulties. We are resolved to do\r\neverything within our power to improve the political,\r\neconomic and social situation of our continent.\r\nWe simply need the benevolent assistance of all\r\nthose who are today richer and are prepared to join us\r\nto bolster our efforts.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Togolese\r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, President of the\r\nTogolese Republic, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Indulis Bērziņ, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLatvia.\r\nMr. Bērziņ (Latvia): Finding ourselves in a new\r\ncentury and in a new millennium, it is natural to review\r\nwhat we have done right and to meditate also on what\r\nwe could have done better. The United Nations is the\r\nforum and the system that allows us to contemplate the\r\nstatus of the worlds development from the widest\r\npossible perspective.\r\nLatvia is small, but the success of our democracy\r\nand the success of our efforts at European integration\r\nwill have a strong positive effect on the destiny of the\r\nBaltic Sea region. The success of an Organization like\r\nthe United Nations can be measured by how its work\r\nhas affected the lives of individual people in all\r\ncountries. In the age of globalization the challenge we\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\ncollectively face is to ensure that all can be\r\nbeneficiaries.\r\nAs a result of the revolution in information\r\ntechnology, the world has grown smaller. Nations and\r\npeople are closer to each other than ever before. This\r\nunderlines the importance of the principle of\r\nuniversality. Today the decisions taken in one part of\r\nthe globe affect people and nations all around the\r\nworld. This calls for wider representation and, in the\r\ncase of the United Nations, for the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, which needs to be carried out to\r\nreflect the present political and economic realities.\r\nTo respond to modern challenges, the United\r\nNations needs both political will and courage. In this\r\nregard, I would like to express my appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his efforts in strengthening and\r\nmodernizing the Organization through its reforms.\r\nThe United Nations also needs to be better\r\nequipped to prevent and manage conflicts.\r\nUnfortunately, the demand for peacekeeping is still\r\nhigh. The Member States, both individually and\r\ncollectively, must do more to meet this demand. Latvia\r\nhas done its best to make its practical contribution to\r\npeace and security. During the past year Latvias\r\npeacekeepers have been present in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and Kosovo as a part of North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization-led forces. In accordance with the\r\nUnited Nations decision to extend the mandate for the\r\noperation in Kosovo, Latvia will continue its\r\nparticipation and will allocate more resources for\r\npeacekeeping operations in next years budget.\r\nAs a future member of the European Union,\r\nLatvia attaches great importance to the development of\r\na common European security and defence policy that\r\nwill increase the European capabilities in conflict\r\nprevention and crisis management. We are willing to\r\ncontribute our forces and to participate in European\r\nUnion operations.\r\nTo provide the United Nations with proper tools\r\nfor peacekeeping, the reforms of the scale of\r\ncontributions must be implemented to reflect the\r\ncapabilities and responsibilities of every Member State.\r\nAt the same time, the United Nations must ensure that\r\nthe resources are spent wisely and operations managed\r\nproperly. For its part, Latvia is considering a review of\r\nits contribution to the peacekeeping budget with a view\r\nto gradually increasing its share.\r\nHuman rights must remain high on the agenda of\r\nthe United Nations in the twenty-first century. As a\r\nmember of the Commission on Human Rights and its\r\nBureau, Latvia remains strongly committed to the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations human rights\r\nmechanisms. In particular, the role of the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nand its programmes, including the development of\r\nnational capacities for the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights, should be strengthened.\r\nLatvia remains committed to the establishment of\r\nthe International Criminal Court. We welcome the\r\nefforts of its Preparatory Commission in tackling the\r\ntask of finalizing the texts of the rules of procedure and\r\nevidence, and the elements of crime, in a timely\r\nmanner. Those who commit crimes against humanity\r\nmust not go unpunished.\r\nFifty years of foreign occupation left us with a\r\nheavy social, economic and psychological burden.\r\nFrom the time of our return to independence in 1991,\r\nLatvia has made every effort to overcome this legacy.\r\nTo be successful in the new millennium, we need the\r\nconsolidated input of all our people, regardless of their\r\noccupation, ethnicity or place of residence. That is why\r\nthe Latvian Government has elaborated its programme\r\nof integration of society. This is an experiment and in\r\nmany ways unique. The integration programme is our\r\nvision of how our society can function most effectively\r\non the basis of democracy and respect for human\r\nrights.\r\nThis programme complements the integration\r\nmeasures being implemented through education with\r\nthe help of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme. The programme will increase public\r\nparticipation and it will reduce differences among the\r\nvarious regions of Latvia. It is a sign of Latvias\r\nreadiness to explore new ways of improving the living\r\nstandards and the social climate.\r\nLatvias international role has grown in the past\r\ndecade of freedom. Each year we are able to do more\r\nfor the people of Latvia and the international\r\ncommunity. With the beginning earlier this year of\r\ntalks for European Union membership, Latvia entered a\r\nnew phase in its international relations. This November\r\nLatvia will assume the presidency of the Council of\r\nEurope  our first presidency in a pan-European\r\norganization.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nLatvia is determined to participate even more\r\nactively in the work of the United Nations. Therefore\r\nLatvia has put forward its candidacy to be a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod of 2006 to 2007. I believe Latvia is ready to\r\nassume this high responsibility.\r\nIt is an honour to present Latvias perspective\r\nhere today at the outset of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish all of us a very useful and\r\nproductive session.\r\nThe President: I now call the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Senegal, His Excellency Mr. Cheikh\r\nTidiane Gadio.\r\nMr. Gadio (Senegal) (spoke in French): The\r\nGeneral Assembly has unanimously chosen you, Sir, to\r\nguide our debates. This is a tribute both to your\r\nqualities as a diplomat and statesman and to your\r\ncountry, Finland, for the very positive role it plays in\r\naddressing the great issues of our modern world.\r\nSenegal is happy to convey to you, through me, its\r\ncongratulations and hopes for success in leading this\r\nsession.\r\nYou were preceded in this office by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of our sister Republic of Namibia, who\r\npresided in the name of our continent, Africa. He\r\nguided our debates successfully throughout his\r\nmandate, which was full of important events for our\r\nOrganization.\r\nI would like at the same time to pay tribute to the\r\nwork of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who\r\nhas devoted himself and all his energy to our\r\nOrganization, in an increasingly complex world. Let us\r\npay him the tribute he richly deserves for the success of\r\nthe Millennium Summit, which proved to the world\r\nthat Mr. Kofi Annan has achieved what he set out to\r\ndo, i.e. to restore the dignity and prestige of the\r\nOrganization as the indispensable forum for\r\nconcertation and concord, and as a peacemaker and\r\npromoter of progress for all.\r\nI would also like, finally, to welcome the\r\ndelegation of Tuvalu, which has become the 189th\r\nMember State.\r\nHistory will recall that, in the framework of the\r\nMillennium Assembly, the Millennium Summit\r\ngathered in this venerable Hall our illustrious heads of\r\nState and Government, who examined the role our\r\nOrganization is being called upon to play in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. These eminent dignitaries thereby gave us\r\na new vision of how to take up the great challenge\r\nposed by globalization  by promoting a new human\r\ninternational order.\r\nThe first half of the year 2000 was also an intense\r\ntime for the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity, what with the holding in June of two major\r\nspecial sessions of the General Assembly. These two\r\nspecial sessions  following up on and reviewing the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women, which was held\r\nin Beijing, and the World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen  produced\r\nencouraging results. My delegation cherishes the hope\r\nthat these sessions will contribute to strengthening the\r\nstatus and role of women in our respective societies by\r\npromoting gender equality, the eradication both of\r\npoverty and of its feminization, and the promotion of\r\nproductive employment and social integration. If we do\r\nnot fully respect women and recognize their essential\r\ncontribution to the progress of our societies, our world\r\nis going continue walking on one leg, when obviously\r\nthere are two.\r\nDespite these new perspectives and their\r\nhistorical importance, this session is not without causes\r\nfor grave concern and even despair. Despite our\r\nongoing efforts, a number of conflicts are persisting\r\nand deepening. From Sierra Leone to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, from Angola to the border\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea, from Burundi to\r\nSomalia, from Kosovo to East Timor we hear the\r\nechoes and see the images and the horror of conflict\r\nzones.\r\nSenegal would like to here voice its great concern\r\nat what is occurring between Guinea and Liberia. Our\r\ncountry calls upon these two countries to carry out a\r\nbrotherly, peaceful dialogue in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). We make the\r\nsame urgent request of the political leaders of Côte\r\ndIvoire, urging them to find a political compromise\r\nthat will enable the great country, Côte dIvoire, which\r\nwe love so well, to live in peace, stability and unity.\r\nIt is in view of such situations that regional\r\norganizations, aware of the fact that Africa is paying a\r\nhigh price for all these conflicts, have resolutely\r\nundertaken to seek political solutions, with the help of\r\nthe international community. This is what occurred in\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nSierra Leone, where the Lomé Agreement, reached\r\nunder the aegis of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States, allowed us to nourish hopes for a\r\nlasting solution. The same can be said for Angola and\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the two\r\nLusaka agreements of 1994 and 1999, respectively.\r\nUnfortunately, these praiseworthy efforts often run up\r\nagainst a lack of commitment on the part of rebel\r\nmovements or armed factions to the very agreements\r\nthat they themselves have signed.\r\nHowever, in spite of this bleak situation, we\r\nshould not give in to discouragement. As the\r\nconstitution of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization says,\r\nsince wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the\r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be\r\nconstructed.\r\nWe have a moral obligation to continue to act with\r\ndetermination and perseverance, bringing the\r\nprotagonists of these conflicts to recognize and\r\nembrace a culture of peace that will allow people to\r\nprogress, committing themselves to forgiveness and\r\nreconciliation.\r\nIt is in this context that my delegation\r\ncongratulates the members of the Panel on United\r\nNations Peace Operations for its recent report. The\r\nsubtlety of the analyses and the relevance of the\r\nrecommendations contained therein open new\r\nperspectives for the United Nations in terms of\r\nreducing tensions and wisely managing conflicts.\r\nSenegal attaches great importance to the consideration\r\nof the Panels recommendations, so that a new\r\npeacekeeping doctrine can be established.\r\nExperience has shown us that the language of\r\nweapons, as well as feeding conflicts by illicitly\r\nexploiting natural resources, cannot produce humanly\r\nacceptable solutions. The only possible solution is one\r\nthat allows peoples to fully enjoy conditions of peace\r\nand economic and social security.\r\nIt is in this context that the Constitutive Act of\r\nthe African Union was signed on 12 July at Lomé, at\r\nthe thirty-sixth session of the Assembly of Heads of\r\nState and Government of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), committing Africa to resolutely engage\r\nin a spirit of unity in finding African solutions to its\r\nmany challenges. This is why the President of the\r\nRepublic, Maître Abdoulaye Wade, a convinced Pan-\r\nAfricanist, led to its completion the procedure making\r\nSenegal the second African country to ratify this\r\nhistoric Act.\r\nBefore Lomé, Africa had already taken another\r\nmeaningful decision, at the Algiers summit, by\r\nproclaiming 2000 the year of peace and concord on the\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe advent of democracy in Guinea-Bissau and\r\nthe efforts to bring about a gradual return to normality\r\nin the life of its citizens and institutions are part of the\r\nresponse to the demand for democracy. Is not the\r\nrecent peaceful political transition in my country,\r\nwhich brought Maître Abdoulaye Wade to the highest\r\nexecutive position, further proof that our peoples can\r\nchoose their leaders in a sovereign and democratic\r\nfashion?\r\nI now turn to the Middle East, where my country\r\nhas noted the major breakthroughs this year in the\r\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, at the heart of which is the\r\nquestion of Palestine. The evacuation of Lebanese\r\nterritory by the Israeli occupation troops and the long\r\nand delicate negotiations at Camp David between\r\nPalestinians and Israelis give rise to hope, despite the\r\ntalks relative failure. Our hopes include that of seeing\r\nthe creation of a space of lasting cohabitation between\r\nIsraelis and Palestinians, as well as between Israel and\r\nits Arab neighbours, with respect for the dignity and\r\nrights of the peoples and States of the region.\r\nIt is only right to pay tribute to all the participants\r\nin this positive development, in particular the\r\nPalestinian and Israeli leadership, who, thanks to their\r\npolitical courage and sense of history have opened this\r\navenue towards a new dawn of peace in the Middle\r\nEast. Senegal reiterates its constant support for\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat and its admiration for his\r\ncourage and political lucidity. He has never dropped\r\nthe olive branch to which he referred here in 1974. Our\r\ncongratulations also go to President Clinton. We\r\nexpress our support for the Prime Minister of Israel,\r\nMr. Barak, as well as the other actors in the peace\r\nprocess, whom we commend for their determined\r\nefforts in search of peace and reconciliation between\r\nall the peoples of the region. We hope that their efforts\r\nwill soon be crowned with positive results.\r\nThe year 2000 was also marked by a relaxation of\r\nmajor importance in relations between the two Koreas.\r\nThis highly significant political development will\r\ncontribute to consolidating peace and security on the\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nKorean peninsula and in the entire subregion of South-\r\nEast Asia. The United Nations, universal symbol of the\r\npeoples aspirations to peace and security, should make\r\na significant contribution to protecting the ongoing\r\nprocess between the two Koreas.\r\nIt is in the name of rapprochement between\r\npeoples and the principle of universality that my\r\ncountry supports the request of the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan to rejoin the concert of free nations within\r\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies, and\r\nthus to participate in the consolidation of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWith the completion last June of the definition of\r\nwhat constitutes crimes, and of the rules of procedure\r\nand testimony, the Preparatory Committee for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court passed a significant\r\nmilestone in the establishment of this important legal\r\ninstitution. This progress and the new ratifications of\r\nthe Rome Statute, are encouraging signs of the\r\ninternational communitys rejection of criminal faits\r\naccomplis, injustice and impunity. I repeat Senegals\r\nsupport for the process, which should bring about a\r\ncredible, independent and efficient International\r\nCriminal Court.\r\nBuilding and consolidating peace also, and above\r\nall, means to meeting the chronic challenge of\r\nunderdevelopment, for, as we know, development is\r\nanother name for peace. Twenty years ago the North-\r\nSouth Commission on development problems strongly\r\nemphasized that where hunger reigns there cannot be\r\npeace, and that whoever wants to banish war must also\r\nbanish poverty. Yet today, despite that warning, poverty\r\npersists and grows, although we have the means to\r\nfight it.\r\nWe dare to hope that next years high-level\r\nmeeting on financing development will be a unique\r\nopportunity to examine in depth the causes of the\r\ndecline in official development assistance and will find\r\nways and means to redress this worrying situation: the\r\nurgent need to deal with the debt crisis, rebalance\r\ninternational trade and deal with the risks of\r\nmarginalization resulting from globalization.\r\nI recall President Wades appeal, warmly received\r\nby his peers, for an in-depth analysis of the African\r\ndebt and for a world summit on globalization to correct\r\nits injustices and contradictions.\r\nI would also like to reiterate Senegals support for\r\ncooperation frameworks such as the EU-ACP\r\nagreements and the Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development (TICAD). We hope that recent\r\ndecisions made at the G-8 Summit in Okinawa, as well\r\nas the American initiative, African Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act, will be the starting point of a new\r\npartnership based on solidarity and mutual benefits.\r\nDevelopment is inseparable from the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights, the rule of law and\r\nsound governance, principles to which my country\r\nremains firmly attached. By creating a human rights\r\nunit attached to the presidency of the Republic, the\r\nHead of State has shown his personal commitment to\r\nthe protection and promoting of citizens fundamental\r\nrights and freedoms by the Administration and at every\r\nlevel of public life. Senegal will continue to make\r\nevery effort to consolidate the foundations of the rule\r\nof law, to protect human rights defenders and to honour\r\nthe obligations it assumes by its adherence to\r\ninternational legal instruments on human rights.\r\nWith the momentum created by the success in\r\nSenegal of the peaceful change-over of political power\r\nand a peaceful transition, my country feels equipped to\r\ncontinue to defend the image of a serene Africa, a\r\nmature Africa, a tolerant and democratic Africa.\r\nToday, more than ever, our people wonder about\r\nthe political will and capacity of our States to take\r\nadvantage of the current international climate, which\r\nseems propitious for a dynamic of peace and for taking\r\ninto account the human dimension in technological\r\ninnovations.\r\nIn Africa our thoughts often turn to the anguish\r\ncaused by the ravages of HIV/AIDS, although with a\r\nl.6 per cent rate, Senegal strengthens the hope that this\r\nscourge will be defeated.\r\nFifty years ago, at the end of the planetary\r\nnightmare of the Second World War, a hope and\r\nconviction were born: that men and women throughout\r\nthe world would do everything possible to prevent new\r\nwars from breaking out and would work together to\r\nensure respect for the right of each individual to\r\nfreedom, justice and progress. Today the intellectual\r\nand material resources available to humanity should\r\nlogically be increasingly dedicated to building a future\r\nof peace, progress and shared happiness. But it must be\r\nsaid that for the great majority of peoples and nations\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nthe international situation does not meet their\r\naspirations to peace and progress.\r\nIn the final analysis, to build a pan-human society\r\nwhich is at peace with itself we must unite all our\r\nenergies to create the basis for more human\r\ndevelopment with greater solidarity, bringing new hope\r\nto future generations. This is the importance and\r\nmeaning of the Millennium Summit, in urging us to\r\nmake a collective contribution to strengthening our\r\nOrganization for the salvation of humanity.\r\nAs it has become a tradition in my country, I will\r\nleave the last word of my statement to the inimitable\r\nSenegal-Cameroon poet of love and hope, David\r\nMandesijop, who said:\r\nHope lived in us as in a citadel.\r\nI hope the aspiration to a more just and happy\r\nworld will live within us all as an impregnable citadel\r\nso, as Mandesijop said, that spring will grow beneath\r\nour footsteps.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): I call on\r\nthe Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Erlan Idrissov.\r\nMr. Idrissov (Kazakhstan): The current political\r\ndebate is taking place against the background that is\r\nnot quite usual. This Hall just heard statements by the\r\nparticipants in the Millennium Summit. Unprecedented\r\nround tables have just been conducted. The last several\r\ndays have brought unusual hectic activity to the United\r\nNations and the city that hosts the headquarters of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe most spectacular thing, however, is that the\r\nSummit has triggered an intellectual burst, an\r\nexplosion of collective thinking. Apparently, this has\r\nbeen predetermined by a special quality of this\r\nparticular moment in time, as we find ourselves at the\r\nthreshold not just of a new century, but of a new\r\nmillennium. Our acquisitive mind tries to look forward\r\nas far as possible and aspires to see there, against all\r\nodds, a better future. Such is the predominant human\r\ntrait  to look forward with optimism.\r\nOur past experience, however, warns us against\r\nexcessive euphoria and illusions. We realize that the\r\nworld is still full of threats, and our common impulse is\r\nto understand these threats and their causes and to find\r\nways to overcome them collectively.\r\nThis is what I felt during the days I spent at the\r\nSummit. I am probably not the only one who thinks the\r\nsame way. But let us hope that the intellectual tide\r\ngenerated by the Summit will not just die down in the\r\nhumdrum of everyday life, but will force us to get\r\ndown to business in order to make our planet a safe and\r\nprosperous place.\r\nAs we approach the new millennium, we surely\r\nwant to take a fresh look at the road we have travelled\r\nso far. At the threshold of a new century, we are in a\r\nposition to say that our most important achievement is\r\nthat the world has become freer. I believe that the key\r\nword explaining the substance of the changes that are\r\ntaking place today should be the word renewal. By our\r\ndefinition, it means an absolutely new era of relations\r\nbetween nations, free of the vestiges of the past:\r\npressure and diktat. It should be a triumph of the\r\nprinciple of genuine democracy and justice when all\r\nStates have equal rights and obligations, irrespective of\r\ntheir economic and political differences.\r\nThe renewal of international relations should be\r\nguided by the understanding that we live now in a\r\nglobal and interdependent world whose overriding\r\nprinciple is global partnership. The United Nations\r\nSecretary-General has rightly proclaimed a three-\r\npronged task: freedom from fear, freedom from want\r\nand saving the human environment, precisely in the\r\ncontext of globalization. It is also true that\r\nglobalization should not overshadow the problems and\r\nconcerns of the ordinary man. Our efforts will be futile\r\nif we do not address the issues we face today in this\r\nlogical sequence.\r\nLet me dwell on the three main components of\r\nour common goal: making the world a safe, free and\r\nprosperous place.\r\nWhile recognizing that global security and\r\nstability increasingly depend on economic,\r\nenvironmental and humanitarian aspects of\r\ndevelopment, we should not belittle the importance of\r\nthe military and political dimension of security. A\r\nfundamental issue of the elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction continues to be a matter of our\r\ncommon concern. International instruments in this\r\nfield, first of all the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention\r\nhave not yet gained universal support and, thus, cannot\r\nbe fully effective. The situation with regard to the Anti-\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nBallistic Missile Treaty is also a cause for concern. We\r\ncall on all countries to radically change this state of\r\naffairs and to support the Secretary-Generals proposal\r\nto hold an international conference to find ways to\r\navert the nuclear threat.\r\nKazakhstan, having been the epicentre of cold-\r\nwar nuclear confrontation and having resolutely\r\nresisted the temptation to turn into a nuclear power\r\nafter it gained independence, has every right to raise\r\nthis issue with vigour.\r\nAs for Kazakhstan, it continues to contribute to\r\nefforts to ensure global security. Fully respecting its\r\nobligations under the above-mentioned international\r\ninstruments, Kazakhstan has been consistently\r\npromoting its initiatives with regard to the Conference\r\non Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in\r\nAsia (CICA) and the establishment of a nuclear-free\r\nzone in Central Asia. We are convinced that the CICA\r\ninitiative has a rational kernel, and we call on the\r\nUnited Nations and the Asian States to continue their\r\nsupport of the CICA process in the interests of Asian\r\nand global security.\r\nWe should be no less and, probably, more\r\nconcerned by new threats: international terrorism,\r\nextremism, illegal trafficking in arms and drugs, and\r\norganized crime. Our newly independent State has\r\ncome into direct contact with these threats. We are\r\nseriously alarmed by the situation in Central Asia and\r\nview the conflict in Afghanistan, the bandit groups\r\ninfiltrations in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and the\r\nsituation in Chechnya in Russia as links in one and the\r\nsame chain. Members have heard our neighbours -\r\nUzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan - talking here\r\nabout the same thing.\r\nI want to emphasize again that the way we see it,\r\nthe root of the evil is the prolonged war in Afghanistan,\r\nand we urge the Security Council to seriously address\r\nthe problem in that country on a long-term basis.\r\nWithout addressing it, it would be naïve to hope for the\r\nelimination of the threat to stability in our region and,\r\nthus, in the whole world. At the same time, we believe\r\nthat the key to the solution of the Afghan problem is in\r\nthe economic revival of Afghanistan. Our common\r\nexperience points to the futility of palliative measures\r\nand attempts to bring the conflicting sides to the\r\nnegotiation table without a clear economic plan. There\r\nshould be a comprehensive plan for the economic\r\nrehabilitation of Afghanistan which, together with\r\neconomic measures, should incorporate the fight\r\nagainst the production of drugs, illegal arms trade,\r\nterrorism and extremism, and should take into account\r\nthe specificity of the ethnic and religious situation in\r\nAfghanistan. Of course, adequate financial resources\r\nshould bolster this comprehensive approach. The price\r\nof peace and human life is worth it.\r\nI would like now to look at the threat to the\r\nstability in our region through the prism of the Caspian\r\nSea. The Caspian treasure-trove has turned now into\r\nthe centre of attention. The interests of many States,\r\nnot just of our region, converge there. The recent\r\ndiscovery in Kazakhstans part of the Caspian Sea of\r\nthe Kashagan oilfield, which is the largest one in the\r\nlast 30 years, with forecasted reserves of 7 billion\r\ntonnes of high-quality oil, confirms once again that the\r\npotential of the Caspian Sea is enormous. It is our\r\ngenuine desire and intention to see that this gift of God\r\nserves the interests of peace and prosperity.\r\nGlobalization involves a new level of interaction\r\nand interdependence of States. However, along with the\r\nobvious benefits, globalization entails the danger of a\r\nlopsided distribution of these benefits, both at the inter-\r\nState and intra-State levels.\r\nA widening gap between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries is a burning issue. In fact, this\r\ngap is getting bigger, and debates are underway as to\r\nthe forms of involvement of both groups of countries in\r\nthe processes of globalization, particularly from the\r\npoint of view of the solution of the problems facing the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe situation with regard to the future of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) provides a good\r\nexample of the differences in appraising the\r\nglobalization phenomenon. This organization, uniting\r\nsome 140 States, has become a trade and economic\r\ncounterpart of the United Nations. It should be said,\r\nhowever, that the WTO has to be thoroughly reformed\r\nin order to really liberalize and democratize trade\r\nrelations. It should not be a controlling and selectively\r\ndiscriminating body of world trade policy.\r\nThe Bretton Woods institutions also have to be\r\nreformed. We believe that the most important goals in\r\nreforming them are to ensure their openness and\r\ndemocratization, competence and adequacy and to\r\nimprove cooperation with the United Nations. We share\r\nthe criticism of the International Monetary Fund\r\nregarding its arm-twisting policy when loans are\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nconditioned on many political factors that have nothing\r\nto do with the actual economic situation.\r\nIn the context of the role of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions in the world, I would like to mention the\r\nissue of the integration into the world economy of the\r\neconomies in transition. The role and importance of\r\nthis group of countries, which includes my own, in the\r\nworld economy and politics will grow. I stress that it is\r\nimportant for Kazakhstan to continue constructive\r\ncooperation with the agencies of the United Nations\r\nfamily, as well as with the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nand other international organizations, in promoting\r\neconomic reforms in my country.\r\nKazakhstan continues to give priority attention to\r\nthe development of the transit transport system in the\r\nStates of Central Asia and in neighbouring developing\r\ncountries. We think it is important to actively pursue\r\nthe improvement of existing programmes and the\r\ndevelopment of new ones designed to raise the\r\nefficiency of the present transit system in Central Asia.\r\nOur landlocked country, and the region as a whole,\r\nshould have secure multiple access to the world\r\nmarket. This is a matter of strengthening our\r\nsovereignty and independence.\r\nEnvironmental issues  particularly the\r\nmanagement of transboundary water resources,\r\nenvironmental pollution and the greenhouse effect \r\nlong ago moved from the social and economic plane to\r\nthe political one, and have acquired truly global\r\nsignificance. All countries face the problems of\r\nprotecting the environment. Yet the effect on the\r\nenvironment experienced by developing countries and\r\neconomies in transition is immeasurably much greater.\r\nEconomic growth has increased the pressure on all the\r\nnatural resources of our planet. The problem of lack of\r\nnatural resources and their depletion creates serious\r\neconomic problems and poverty. Economic\r\ndevelopment cannot stop. However, it should follow a\r\ndifferent path. It should cease to destroy the\r\nenvironment so aggressively. It is because of the\r\nunderestimation of environmental factors that\r\nKazakhstan today faces such ecological disasters as\r\nthose involving the Aral and Caspian Seas and the\r\nformer Semipalatinsk testing ground.\r\nThere have been many cases in history of nations\r\nand States being in conflict over the lack of drinking\r\nwater and water for irrigation. Thousands and\r\nthousands of people have often had to pull up their\r\nroots because of problems with water. Reducing the\r\nnumber of people without access to safe water is as\r\nvital today as ever. Kazakhstan calls for every country\r\nto adopt, under bilateral and multilateral treaties,\r\nlegislative and administrative measures with regard to\r\ntransboundary water resources and their management.\r\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for\r\nEurope and the United Nations Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific have devised a\r\njoint Special Programme for the Economies of Central\r\nAsia (SPECA), which encompasses all priority issues\r\nfacing the region: development of the transit transport\r\ncapacity and multiple pipeline systems; the\r\nmanagement of energy and water resources;\r\nenvironmental protection; and technological growth.\r\nSuch a comprehensive approach promotes better\r\nregional cooperation in Central Asia and the\r\nintegration of its considerable potential into the world\r\neconomy. It serves common interests. We therefore\r\nurge the international donor community to actively\r\ncontribute to the SPECA programmes and to promote\r\nthe economic and democratic growth of Kazakhstan\r\nand other newly independent States in Central Asia.\r\nThe three-pronged goal of global development,\r\nwhich I mentioned at the beginning of my statement,\r\nwould be unattainable without an effective common\r\ntool. Such a took we see in the United Nations, and we\r\nare convinced that there is no alternative to our\r\nOrganization. But the next century and the new, highly\r\ncomplex tasks we face will demand a radically renewed\r\nOrganization free from the stereotypes of the past. This\r\nmatter is in our hands. We should support the genuine\r\ndesire of the Secretary-General to drastically revamp\r\nour Organization.\r\nWe believe that it is important to start from the\r\nhead  that is, the Security Council. The debates on\r\nthat subject have gone on far too long. Shall we\r\ncontinue to mark time, or shall we take a responsible\r\ncollective decision? We stand for the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council, in both categories of membership, on\r\nthe basis of equitable geographic representation and\r\nrespect for the sovereign equality of all United Nations\r\nMember States. Kazakhstan supports the inclusion of\r\nGermany and Japan, as well as major developing\r\ncountries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, as\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, and also\r\nsupports an increase in the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nWe believe that the peacemaking capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations should also be strengthened\r\nconsiderably, and we support the conclusions of the\r\nreport (A/55/305) by the Brahimi Panel. As for\r\nKazakhstan, it is forming peacekeeping forces through\r\nits participation in the Central Asian battalion,\r\ncomposed of three States of Central Asia, and through\r\nthe creation of its own Kazakhstan battalion.\r\nThere is no doubt that the financial capacity of\r\nthe United Nations should be commensurate with the\r\nnew tasks that the Organization is asked to perform.\r\nAll Member States should meet their financial\r\nobligations under the United Nations Charter. In spite\r\nof its temporary economic difficulties, Kazakhstan is\r\nstriving to do just that and is taking practical steps in\r\nthat direction. As to the scale of assessments and its\r\nmethodology, we have always believed, and continue to\r\nbelieve, that the main criterion should be a countrys\r\nreal capacity to pay.\r\nWe have set ambitious tasks for ourselves. Are\r\nwe up to them? I am absolutely sure that we are, if we\r\njoin our efforts. In fact, there is no other way. Such is\r\nthe imperative of a new era, such are the aspirations of\r\nour nations.\r\nI thank the Assembly for its attention and wish it\r\nsuccess in its endeavour to build a safer and better\r\nworld in the next century.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Soledad Alvear Valenzuela.\r\nMrs. Valenzuela (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): First\r\nof all, Mr. President, permit me to congratulate you on\r\nyour election to preside over the Assemblys fifty-fifth\r\nsession, the first of the new millennium. I wish you\r\nevery success in your presidency, and promise you\r\nChiles full cooperation as you carry out your\r\nimportant duties. I would like to express our\r\nadmiration and affection for the country you represent,\r\nFinland. My appreciation also goes to the praiseworthy\r\nefforts of Foreign Minister Gurirab of Namibia during\r\nthe work of the session that has just come to an end.\r\nLikewise, we congratulate the Secretary-General on the\r\nleadership he has demonstrated since taking office. We\r\nrecognize and value his commitment to the vision of a\r\nnew United Nations for the twenty-first century. We\r\nencourage him to continue his efforts to reform the\r\nOrganization.\r\nGlobalization is without a doubt the name of our\r\nera. Today it is pointless to ask ourselves whether we\r\nwant to participate in globalization. Isolation is not a\r\nrealistic option. Chile views globalization as an\r\nunquestionable reality and as a font of opportunity that\r\nhas brought us very valuable benefits. The opening of\r\nour economy has enabled us to double the size of our\r\ngross domestic product within 10 years, compared with\r\nthe almost 50 years it took to accomplish the previous\r\ndoubling. Technological advances have helped to bring\r\nus closer to major world centres.\r\nGlobalization gives rise to opportunities, but it\r\ncan also deepen the inequities which have always\r\ncharacterized the international system. The United\r\nNations can help to ensure that globalization does not\r\nresult in exclusion, with the benefits of modernization\r\nlimited to a lucky few. We must make a firm\r\ncommitment to developing a new form of international\r\ncooperation, focused in particular on broadening access\r\nto the knowledge-based economy.\r\nThe flows of goods, services, capital, information\r\nand technology characteristic of globalization tend to\r\nbypass domestic regulations and escape the control of\r\nGovernments. This lack of regulation is generally not\r\ncounterbalanced by other standards or authorities. It is\r\nup to us to fill this vacuum by using all available\r\nmultilateral forums.\r\nAs never before in the history of humanity,\r\nresolving the daily problems faced by people\r\nworldwide depends on collective international\r\ndecision-making. The challenge confronting the United\r\nNations today is to lend a certain degree of order to\r\nglobalization; to establish effective institutions and\r\nrules, so that globalization will serve to advance the\r\ndevelopment of our peoples; and to ensure that the\r\nfruits of scientific and technological advances benefit\r\nall peoples.\r\nAt the Rio Groups most recent Summit of Heads\r\nof State or Government, held in Cartagena, Colombia,\r\nthe countries that make up this regional political\r\ncoordination body prepared a joint contribution to the\r\nMillennium Summit, reaffirming the central role of the\r\nUnited Nations in this new era on which we are\r\nembarking.\r\nThe past year has given rise to a mixture of hope\r\nand concern with regard to peace and security. Chile\r\nfollowed with particular interest the historic talks held\r\nbetween the leaders of North and South Korea, from 13\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nto 15 June of this year. We congratulate the leaders and\r\nthe peoples of both countries on the progress made at\r\nthis groundbreaking summit.\r\nThe conflict in the Middle East has entered what\r\nseems to be a decisive stage. We are heartened by the\r\nadvances made this year and encourage the parties to\r\ncontinue their negotiations in accordance with the\r\nestablished timetables and relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. We are confident that Israel and the\r\nPalestinian National Authority will find satisfactory\r\nsolutions to the remaining issues, particularly those\r\nrelated to Jerusalem. We are also encouraged by\r\nIsraels withdrawal from southern Lebanon.\r\nWe support the Security Councils decisions\r\nestablishing a massive humanitarian programme for\r\nIraq  under the oil-for-food formula, and we favour\r\nan ongoing evaluation of that programme. We urge the\r\nIraqi Government to cooperate effectively with the new\r\ninspection agency  the United Nations Monitoring,\r\nVerification and Inspection Commission  whose\r\nwork we deem particularly important.\r\nWe have followed closely developments in the\r\nBalkans. The seeds of intolerance and ethnic\r\ncleansing are still present in the region. Chile views\r\nwith fear the possibility of a new Balkan conflict. Only\r\nfull respect for democracy and human rights can bring\r\nabout peace in the region.\r\nWe are concerned by the conflicts in Africa. We\r\nare hopeful as to the significant mediating role played\r\nby regional entities such as the Organization for\r\nAfrican Unity, especially in the Ethiopia-Eritrea\r\ndispute, and the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity. We hope that these efforts, along with\r\nthose of the United Nations, can bring about peace,\r\nallowing the continent to fully develop its enormous\r\npotential.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Security Council\r\nhas directly addressed the scourge of HIV/AIDS in\r\nAfrica, designating it as an international security issue\r\nrequiring urgent action. We hope that initiatives will be\r\nadopted to effectively combat this problem, which casts\r\nan even greater shadow over the future of the continent\r\nthan the current armed conflicts.\r\nWe view with concern the difficulties surrounding\r\nthe upcoming referendum in the Western Sahara. Chile\r\nwould like to see the elections take place as soon as\r\npossible, on the basis of a free and secret ballot and\r\nadequate voter information. We are concerned about\r\nthe obstacles that are hindering this undertaking.\r\nAlthough post-cold-war hopes for a world free of\r\nnuclear weapons in the near future have been tempered,\r\nthat goal remains fully valid. I have the honour to\r\nreport than on 12 July, Chile deposited its instrument of\r\nratification for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty  the sixteenth country to do so. We call upon\r\nall nations to ratify this Treaty as soon as possible in\r\norder to reach the quorum of 44 countries necessary for\r\nits entry into force.\r\nIn our information-based society, the problems\r\nexperienced by any one country affect the world\r\ncommunity as a whole. No state can shirk its the\r\nresponsibility to promote peaceful coexistence within\r\nand among nations. From the ethical standpoint of our\r\ncommon humanity, we have viewed with interest the\r\ndevelopment of the concept of humanitarian\r\nintervention. Chile continues to abide by the principles\r\nof non-intervention and the self-determination of\r\npeoples. But these principles must be linked to other\r\nprinciples of equal or higher priority, which have\r\nemerged prominently since the end of the cold war. We\r\ncannot remain impassive in the face of the\r\nhumanitarian catastrophes caused by great conflicts.\r\nThus, we propose that in specific cases, and in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nconcerted multilateral action be taken to provide rapid\r\nassistance to those who are suffering. Chile is also an\r\nenthusiastic participant in the Human Security\r\nNetwork, in response to an initiative put forward by\r\nCanada and Norway.\r\nChile considers it an ethical and political\r\nimperative of the greatest urgency to expand its\r\nparticipation in the United Nations peacekeeping\r\nforces. Since 1999, we have developed an internal legal\r\nframework that is in closer harmony with international\r\nrequirements for participation in these operations.\r\nThose legal modifications have enabled us to\r\nparticipate in the United Nations Transitional\r\nAdministration in East Timor, beginning in February of\r\nthis year.\r\nMy country is also willing to discuss a new\r\npayment scale for the financing of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. We believe that this scale\r\nmust be adjusted to reflect the current financial\r\nsituation of Member States.\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nWe cannot fail to mention the process of Security\r\nCouncil reform. While some progress has been noted in\r\ndiscussions of the Councils methods of work and of\r\nthe degree of transparency required by this body, we\r\nnote that there have been few, if any, advances toward\r\nthe expansion of its membership.\r\nChile feels a certain dismay and fatigue at the\r\nlack of progress, which is the result of positions that\r\nappear irreconcilable. The issue of the veto further\r\ncomplicates this sensitive subject. Until we seriously\r\naddress the question of limiting the veto with a view to\r\nits ultimate abolishment, we doubt that the discussions\r\nundertaken by the Assemblys Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security\r\nCouncil will bear fruit.\r\nGlobalization is not limited to the economic\r\nsphere. It also involves the universalization of values\r\nand principles of our common humanity, and the\r\nstrengthening of the rights of the individual, which\r\nhave increasingly become subjects addressed by\r\ninternational law. The absence of democracy and good\r\ngovernance, and the peoples lack of a voice and\r\nparticipation in public affairs in States Members of the\r\nOrganization are of concern to us all. The United\r\nNations exists for individuals, not for those who\r\ngovern. Under the imperative of putting people at the\r\ncentre of all our efforts, we must support and promote\r\nhuman rights and democratic processes.\r\nChile was among the countries that worked to\r\nconvene the Towards a Community of Democracies\r\nconference held at Warsaw, Poland, last June. More\r\nthan 100 United Nations Member nations participated\r\nin that gathering and endorsed its final declaration. We\r\nare convinced that, as time passes, the community of\r\ndemocracies will be an increasingly potent moral force\r\nwithin the United Nations, provided that it maintains\r\nits high standards and requirements.\r\nDemocracy is based on justice, both national and\r\nuniversal. Chile enthusiastically supports the\r\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court, and\r\nhopes that all countries will ratify its statute.\r\nEstablishing a permanent body to exercise criminal\r\njurisdiction over those accused of crimes that fall\r\nwithin its purview will discourage the irregular\r\ndomestic proceedings which have allowed such\r\nindividuals to enjoy impunity, as well as limiting\r\njurisdictional disputes among countries.\r\nAt the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nheld at Copenhagen in 1995, heads of State or\r\nGovernment met for the first time in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations to declare with force and clarity that\r\nthe chief responsibility of our societies is to improve\r\nthe quality of life of our populations, particularly for\r\ntheir most marginalized and dispossessed members.\r\nThis year, in a special session, the Assembly reviewed\r\nthe progress made towards fulfilling the Summits\r\ncommitments and launched new initiatives on their\r\ngenuine implementation. That was an important step in\r\nthe quest to better humanize the process of\r\nglobalization. We must continue to incorporate the\r\nobjectives of the social Summit into our national and\r\nmultilateral policies.\r\nIn the social sphere, the United Nations has\r\nrecognized the vital need to promote gender equality.\r\nChile has worked together with our regional\r\nneighbours in Latin America and the Caribbean to\r\nreaffirm the principles and proposals of the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women. We have renewed our\r\ncommitment to the advancement of women, and have\r\ndeveloped a new plan to equalize opportunities for men\r\nand for women. A concrete demonstration of that\r\ncommitment is the fact that about one third of\r\nPresident Lagos Escobars cabinet members are\r\nwomen.\r\nWe reiterate Chiles strong support for\r\npreparations for the General Assemblys 2001 special\r\nsession to follow up the World Summit for Children.\r\nWe also attribute special significance to the concern of\r\nthe United Nations for the rights and welfare of\r\nindigenous populations and of the elderly.\r\nChile has volunteered to host the regional\r\npreparatory meeting for the World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance. We aim to contribute to the\r\nregional consensus in that area, confirming our very\r\nfirm commitment to tolerance and respect for diversity.\r\nEnvironmental protection is an issue that crosses\r\nnational borders and has become a global concern,\r\ndriven in part by an emerging international civil\r\nsociety. Here, international cooperation, under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, continues to be an\r\nurgent necessity. The United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro,\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nlaid the foundations for agreements on climate change,\r\nforest conservation and biodiversity. It is very\r\nimportant that we fulfil and gradually expand those\r\ncommitments with new agreements and protocols\r\nensuring the management, protection and conservation\r\nof our planets resources. This session, as well as the\r\nRio + 10 event which will take place in 2002, must\r\ncontinue to spur commitment to a new ethic of\r\nenvironmental conservation.\r\nWe are witnessing the globalization of financial\r\nmarkets, which significantly affect capital, currency\r\nand credit flows, as well as the economies of all of\r\nnations. As recent experience demonstrates, a financial\r\ncrisis in one corner of the world can rapidly trigger a\r\ndomino effect, spreading the crisis even to faraway\r\nnations with no responsibility for or control over the\r\ncauses of the original disturbance. It is a great injustice\r\nthat countries that have been prudent and responsible in\r\nthe management of their domestic economies can be\r\naffected by problems with which they had nothing to\r\ndo. It is urgent for us to find ways to impose order and\r\nstandards of good management on the international\r\nworld. This does not mean obstructing international\r\ncapital flows, but rather establishing an appropriate\r\ninternational framework to address the problems they\r\nmay cause.\r\nChile has enthusiastically supported the\r\ninternational communitys progress towards free trade\r\nthrough deregulation and the elimination of\r\nprotectionist measures and barriers. The failure of the\r\n1999 Seattle World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nconference was unfortunate. But let us be frank: that\r\nfailure was not brought about by civil-society\r\ndemonstrations, but by the lack of agreement among\r\nthe worlds leading commercial Powers. Chile\r\ncontinues to believe in the urgent necessity of initiating\r\na new round of multilateral trade negotiations.\r\nThe United Nations must play a key role in\r\nbringing about substantive improvements in the\r\nmanagement of commercial, monetary and financial\r\nsystems, so that their operations will take into account\r\nthe needs of all countries. The Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has done commendable work to coordinate\r\nUnited Nations activities with those of the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. But the General Assembly too has\r\na critical role to play in this area.\r\nThe decision to hold a High-level International\r\nand Intergovernmental Event on Financing for\r\nDevelopment in 2001 was of groundbreaking\r\nsignificance, and we must resolve to carry forward the\r\ncommitments expressed at the Millennium Summit to\r\nensure the success of that event. That would lead to a\r\nnew phase in North-South relations, since the political\r\nlegitimacy arising from a broad multilateral consensus\r\nwill allow us to design a new financial architecture and\r\na system of international trade and exchange that\r\nreflect the legitimate interests of all the worlds\r\npeoples.\r\nMy country believes that official development\r\nassistance is still necessary to promote the\r\ndevelopment of many countries and regions. A\r\nglobalized world cannot neglect the principle of\r\nsolidarity, which is an idea so central to the United\r\nNations tradition. In the same spirit, international\r\nassistance must be provided to relieve the distressing\r\nconditions of many countries burdened with\r\nunsustainable debt, so that they can meet the\r\nchallenges of development.\r\nThis year Chile began a new six-year political\r\nterm, under fully democratic conditions. Our country is\r\nin complete harmony with the international community.\r\nWe possess a vibrant civil society, which made its own\r\ncontributions to our preparation for the Millennium\r\nSummit. Human rights and the rule of law are\r\nrespected in Chile. Our courts impart justice with\r\nrigour and a sense of responsibility. We enjoy a\r\nvigorous and open economy, and we have resolved to\r\ncontinue reducing inequalities in our country. We reach\r\nout to the world from a firm foundation in our own\r\nregion, Latin America. We are strengthening our\r\nmultilateral policies, based on open regionalism and on\r\ncooperation with countries with similar criteria\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWe are confident that this General Assembly\r\nsession, dedicated to the millennium, will be recorded\r\nas the one in which we began to address the great\r\nchallenge of our time: to give order to the forces of\r\nglobalization and promote the extension of its benefits\r\nto an ever-increasing number of the inhabitants of our\r\nplanet. You can rest assured, Mr. President, that Chiles\r\ndelegation will lend its full support to meeting this\r\nchallenge.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Vice-\r\nChairperson of the delegation of Finland, Ms. Marjatta\r\nRasi.\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nMs. Rasi (Finland): I will deliver this statement\r\non behalf of Mr. Erkki Tuomioja, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Finland.\r\nThe heads of State and Government have just\r\ncompleted the largest-ever United Nations gathering,\r\nthe Millennium Summit. They adopted a forward-\r\nlooking and ambitious Millennium Declaration. This,\r\ntogether with the Secretary-Generals report for the\r\nSummit, sets a demanding agenda for the United\r\nNations for the new millennium. A new spirit was\r\nkindled in the Summit. We need to keep that spirit alive\r\nin the Assembly, which now has the responsibility to\r\nstart the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe President of Finland made a statement on the\r\nneed for the United Nations to be relevant for the\r\nMember States and their people. I should like to\r\nelaborate on some of her ideas a little further, fully\r\nsupporting the statement made by the French Foreign\r\nMinister, Mr. Védrine, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nOne of the most inspiring concepts that the\r\nSecretary-General has advocated is the culture of\r\nprevention. If we want the United Nations to be\r\nrelevant, we must equip it with the means to be one\r\nstep ahead of developments. Successful prevention\r\nrequires a profound understanding of underlying\r\ncauses. By understanding these causes, we can\r\nestablish an early warning system that allows us to act\r\nin time, before the conflicts erupt.\r\nOne of the root causes of conflicts is poverty. As\r\nalmost half of the worlds population still have to make\r\ndo with less than $2 dollars a day, and struggle for\r\nexistence, conflicts can flare up easily. Poverty is also\r\nan affront to human dignity. Trying to halve the\r\nproportion of people living in extreme poverty requires\r\ncommon efforts. Democracy and respect for human\r\nrights are important preconditions for all development\r\nand for poverty eradication to be sustained. Without\r\ndemocratic decision-making, respect for the rule of\r\nlaw, human rights and fundamental freedoms, gender\r\nequality and good governance, it is unrealistic to\r\nexpect sustainable results in poverty reduction.\r\nDemand for respect for human rights will\r\ncontinue to shape the destiny of humankind in the\r\nfuture. One of the greatest achievements of the United\r\nNations has been the codification of a core set of\r\nhuman rights standards. Governments have the\r\nobligation to implement these standards. The United\r\nNations is the only global organization primarily\r\nmandated to ensure respect for human rights. It should\r\ndevote more attention and resources to the full\r\nrealization and enjoyment of these rights universally.\r\nGlobalization is not only an unavoidable process\r\nbut also something which is on the whole beneficial for\r\nhuman development. Globalization today is not merely\r\na continuation of the familiar process of\r\ninternationalization of trade, market integration and\r\ngrowing interdependence. In these processes, we\r\nencounter the phenomenon of quantity changing into\r\nquality. The development of new technologies greatly\r\nmultiplies the effects, both positive and negative, of\r\nglobalization. I believe that the great majority of the\r\nworlds population have benefited from globalization.\r\nSome have certainly made vast profits from it. As such,\r\nthis is not to be deplored; but, at the same time, too\r\nmany people are losers in the same process. Many\r\nmore fear the potential threats and losses they perceive\r\nas negative effects of globalization. Still more are\r\nanxious as to whether global processes are under\r\ncontrol any longer. For these reasons, it is of the utmost\r\nimportance for us to be able to face the challenges of\r\nglobalization and to counter many of its negative\r\neffects.\r\nMr. Sychov (Belarus), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe United Nations, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nas well as other international actors, must join forces in\r\nadopting and implementing the common rules needed\r\nto harness the positive power of globalization. Trade\r\nliberalization and trade rules under the auspices of the\r\nWTO should be implemented in such a way that they\r\nbenefit all, particularly the poorest, as well as\r\nsafeguard our common environment.\r\nOne aspect of managing globalization is the need\r\nto enhance stability, transparency and responsible\r\nbehaviour in international financial markets. We must\r\ncounter disturbances caused, for example, by short-\r\nterm speculative capital movements. Initiatives such as\r\ncurrency transaction taxes, the so-called Tobin tax,\r\ndeserve careful consideration. If, as some studies\r\nindicate, such a tax is unworkable, it is all the more\r\nimportant to propose and adopt other means and\r\ninstruments to achieve the same aims.\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nOne of the most recent challenges is the digital\r\ndivide created by the revolution in information and\r\ncommunication technology. Computerization and\r\nInternet literacy are not an end as such. They should\r\nserve the purposes of development: education, literacy,\r\nhealth care, empowerment and inclusion. By closing\r\nthe digital gap, we help developing countries join the\r\nknowledge-based global economy. In the long run, the\r\ndigital revolution has the greatest potential for the\r\ndeveloping countries. Information and communication\r\ntechnology (ICT) will make technological leap-\r\nfrogging possible for developing countries.\r\nThe global agenda set in the United Nations\r\nconferences and summits in the 1990s addressed many\r\nsuch basic needs of human life which need common\r\nattention in the process of globalization. Progress was\r\nmade on human rights, gender equality, population,\r\nsocial development, sustainable development, drugs,\r\nenvironmental issues and many others. In the new\r\nmillennium, we must focus on the accelerated\r\nimplementation of the plans of action adopted at these\r\nconferences. Still, our agenda keeps growing. Children,\r\nHIV/AIDS, racism and racial discrimination, financing\r\nfor development, least developed countries as well as\r\nsustainable development and the environment require\r\nmore profound attention from the world community.\r\nEven with these issues, I am afraid that our agenda is\r\nnot exhausted. The growing agenda poses valid\r\ndemands of coherence on the United Nations system\r\nand its work, as well as on the Member States.\r\nNo matter how well we implement the global\r\nagenda and no matter how much we resort to\r\npreventive actions, we have to have improved means to\r\nsolve crises and conflicts as peacefully and rapidly as\r\npossible. Finland welcomes the Secretary-Generals\r\ninitiative to take a critical look at the United Nations\r\npeace operations by a Panel of eminent persons. The\r\nBrahimi report suggests a comprehensive reform of\r\npeace operations. We need a detailed discussion on the\r\nreport without delay. There are lessons to be learned\r\nfor the United Nations and its Member States. We\r\nshould particularly learn from the failures so as not to\r\nrepeat them, but we also must learn from successes and\r\nsee what works.\r\nWe need to address the whole continuum of peace\r\noperations from the standpoint of prevention. It is most\r\nimportant to try to prevent crises from erupting.\r\nPrevention is an important element during a crisis as\r\nwe try to stop its escalation. Prevention continues after\r\ncrises in post-conflict peace-building, as we need to\r\nminimize their consequences and their duration, not to\r\nspeak of their repetition. Kosovo is a prime example of\r\nthis.\r\nI am stating the obvious when I say that the\r\nUnited Nations needs a rapid-reaction capability,\r\nqualified and experienced personnel to perform the\r\noperations, as well as the money to pay for them. This\r\nwould make it easier to address an increased demand\r\nfor United Nations peacekeeping.\r\nThe critical approach taken in the Brahimi report\r\nshould also be extended to other fields and activities of\r\nthe United Nations in order to attain efficiency within\r\nthe Organization. Reorganization and prioritization\r\nwould free both human and financial resources for the\r\ncore areas of our responsibilities.\r\nThere have been positive developments in some\r\ncrises that have long been on the United Nations\r\nagenda. A most encouraging example is the\r\nrapprochement in the Korean peninsula. Finland\r\nwelcomes the positive development to bring peace,\r\nstability and reunification to the Korean peninsula and\r\nencourages the two parties to advance the process of\r\ndialogue. Finland also welcomes the withdrawal of\r\nIsraeli troops from southern Lebanon in accordance\r\nwith Security Council resolution 425 (1978). We hope\r\nthis leads to a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\r\nthe Middle East.\r\nThe nation-building process in East Timor has\r\nstarted successfully. I hope that the present transition\r\nperiod will soon lead to full independence for East\r\nTimor. Recent incidents in West Timor against United\r\nNations personnel, however, jeopardize the progress\r\nand the capabilities of the United Nations system to\r\nhelp. We also strongly support the Secretary-Generals\r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the\r\nCyprus problem.\r\nDevelopments in Africa have not been\r\nencouraging. I regret deeply that the safety and security\r\nof United Nations personnel have not been guaranteed\r\nin all United Nations operations, such as that in Sierra\r\nLeone. However, Eritrea and Ethiopia have reached an\r\nagreement and international monitoring can start. I am\r\nhappy to announce that Finland will participate in the\r\nUnited Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.\r\nThe continuum of multidimensional crises must\r\nbe prevented, managed and solved with appropriate\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nmultidimensional means. Addressing them requires\r\ncooperation among different organizations, such as the\r\nUnited Nations, the European Union, the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and the Organization of American\r\nStates, to mention but a few. The complexity of crises\r\nhas shown that no single organization is capable of\r\ndealing with all aspects of a crisis  military, civilian\r\nand humanitarian. Sad experiences, for example from\r\nthe Balkans, remind us that many weaknesses still exist\r\nin the conflict-prevention and management capabilities\r\nof the international community. A clearer division of\r\nlabour between the organizations is needed. They must\r\nconcentrate on what they can do best, following the\r\nprinciple of comparative advantage. Complementarity\r\nand cooperation are the friends, and rivalry the enemy,\r\nof any operation.\r\nCoherent action is needed to address the\r\nsituations, bearing in mind the comprehensive concept\r\nof security. I stress the need to enhance our civilian\r\ncrisis-management capabilities in all relevant fields.\r\nComplex crises need expertise in the fields of civilian\r\npolice, the rule of law, human rights, justice, electoral\r\nassistance, institution-building, economic reconstruction\r\nand rehabilitation, as well as impartial media. As stated\r\nin the Brahimi report, doctrinal shifts and more\r\nthorough strategic planning are needed at the United\r\nNations to address complex and often intrastate\r\nconflicts.\r\nPeace and security are indivisible. Disarmament\r\nis a part of comprehensive and integrated action in\r\npreventing conflicts and in promoting a global dialogue\r\non peace and stability. Arms control agreements,\r\nincluding the Treaty between the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\r\non the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems,\r\nremain a cornerstone of international security. The\r\nsuccessful outcome of the Review Conference of the\r\nStates Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) created a new momentum in\r\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must be\r\nratified by all. We hope for a swift entry into force of\r\nthe START II Treaty and we are looking forward to the\r\ncommencement of the START III negotiations.\r\nOne of the main concerns is the regional arms\r\nrace. We need to ensure that the few countries\r\nremaining outside the NPT regime do not develop\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Also, conventional arms,\r\nand in particular anti-personnel landmines, small arms\r\nand light weapons, remain a concern in regional and\r\ninternal conflicts. The United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nAll Its Aspects should aim at achieving significant\r\nresults in adopting a comprehensive approach\r\nintegrating security and development.\r\nEnhanced international action is also needed in\r\nhumanitarian demining, particularly in post-conflict\r\nsituations where civilian populations continue to be\r\nvictims of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nI wish to join the Secretary-Generals call on all\r\nStates to sign and ratify the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) at the earliest\r\npossible date. It is important now to build on what has\r\nbeen achieved in and after the Rome Conference and to\r\nsecure the early establishment of the ICC, fully\r\nrespecting the integrity of its Statute. More and more\r\nStates, including my own, are approaching the stage of\r\nratification of the Rome Statute. We are confident that,\r\nin the long run, all States will recognize the benefits of\r\na permanent International Criminal Court.\r\nTerrorism is an evil we must combat decisively\r\nand effectively so that everyone can live and travel\r\nfreely in the world without having to fear crime and\r\nkidnappings. We have negotiated 12 major anti-\r\nterrorism conventions within the United Nations\r\nframework that make it clear that terrorist acts are\r\ncriminal and can never be justified by any ends. This\r\nobviously also applies to the means used to combat\r\nterrorism.\r\nFinland welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to offer an opportunity to sign any treaty or\r\nconvention of which the Secretary-General is the\r\ndepositary. In this connection, I should also like to\r\nmake reference to the Tampere Convention on the\r\nProvision of Telecommunication Resources for\r\nDisaster Mitigation and Relief Operations. As the host\r\ncountry of the relevant conference, Finland would like\r\nto encourage all States to sign and ratify the\r\nConvention in order to bring it into force as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nThe purposes enshrined in the Charter and the\r\nnew challenges the United Nations is facing require\r\nunwavering support for the United Nations and for\r\nmultilateralism from its Member States. The United\r\nNations is an expression of the will of its Member\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nStates to deliberate and act multilaterally. There are\r\nmany reasons why multilateralism is the preferred, as\r\nwell as perhaps the only sustainable, way to deal with\r\nproblems. It involves all the actors that are needed for\r\nthe long-term solution of conflicts. It provides the\r\ntransparency that modern conflict resolution requires.\r\nIt strengthens respect for international law in general.\r\nLast but not least, it diminishes the possibility that\r\nforce will be used unnecessarily or disproportionately.\r\nA tendency towards unilateralism would only\r\nreopen old divisions or create new ones. The United\r\nNations is a stronghold of multilateralism, and it\r\nshould be used to safeguard the primacy of multilateral\r\naction. In this respect, we must ensure that the United\r\nNations is able to act effectively when the need arises.\r\nThe role and ability of the Secretary-General must be\r\nenhanced to enable the Organization to act when it is\r\notherwise threatened with paralysis.\r\nIn this context, I want to make it clear that the\r\ncrisis management capacity under construction in the\r\nEuropean Union will be at the service of the\r\ninternational community. It is not intended for\r\nunilateral interventionism. The Union will contribute to\r\ninternational peace and security in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the\r\nprinciples and objectives of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe Charter on\r\nEuropean Security.\r\nFor this kind of a multilateralism to work, United\r\nNations finances must be put on a sound, sustainable\r\nand equitable basis. This is crucial for its strength and\r\ncredibility. Charter obligations related to the payment\r\nof contributions must be fulfilled by all, on time, in full\r\nand without conditions.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations,\r\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations has\r\nbeen very successful, and it must be intensified and\r\nfacilitated. It has to be extended to cover the whole of\r\ncivil society. Present challenges are too heavy for the\r\nUnited Nations to carry alone. I commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his several initiatives in this\r\nrespect. In particular, I would mention his Global\r\nCompact initiative, which seeks to engage corporations\r\nin the promotion of equitable labour standards, respect\r\nfor human rights and the protection of the environment.\r\nCooperation with civil society is a necessity for the\r\nnew millennium. Strong partnerships are needed to\r\nmeet the challenges posed every day in the present\r\nworld. This trend should be strengthened and\r\nencouraged.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Roberto Flores Bermúdez, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Honduras.\r\nMr. Flores Bermúdez (Honduras) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to address the General\r\nAssembly, which will complement the recent\r\nMillennium Summit by providing a fundamental\r\ncontribution to the current stage of transition towards a\r\nUnited Nations in tune with reality.\r\nInternational peace and security, along with\r\ncooperation and solidarity for sustainable human\r\ndevelopment, must become the fundamental\r\ninstruments of our new Organization in the new\r\nmillennium. Peace and security require a renewed\r\ncommitment to international law, full respect for and\r\nfaithful, prompt compliance with the decisions of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, national compliance\r\nwith the standards imposed by treaties and good faith\r\nin the application of laws, uncompromised by domestic\r\npolitical agendas.\r\nHonduras, a founding Member of the United\r\nNations, considers that the decisions of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice are a solid basis for the\r\nresolution of international conflicts and that they\r\nrepresent the fundamental norms for coexistence\r\namong States, with the support of the Security Council\r\nas the guarantor of their implementation.\r\nPeace and security among nations require the\r\ndelimitation of land and maritime areas, in keeping\r\nwith the rules of international law. They require respect\r\nfor historical rights and the non-use of force. Only with\r\ndefined boundaries can we determine clearly what\r\ncontribution everyone can make to our common causes\r\nand promote the development of borders of solidarity\r\non the basis of a culture of peace.\r\nThe 1,000 years that now lie behind us produced\r\nextraordinary advances in the history of humanity. But\r\nthey also left us tasks to be completed relating to\r\nproblems such as racism, xenophobia, an arsenal of\r\nweapons of various magnitudes and the effects of a\r\nculture of violence and destruction. This is why we\r\nfirmly support the consolidation of the peace process in\r\nthe Middle East. We welcome the constructive dialogue\r\nlaunched by the two Koreas in an effort to normalize\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\ntheir relations, as we welcome peaceful solutions for\r\nany divided society.\r\nAs regards globalization, we must tackle not only\r\nthe economic aspect, but also social well-being.\r\nEducation is a passport to the future, but only if the\r\neducation provided is the same for all, and not just for\r\na minority, and only if education is life-affirming and\r\npromotes change so as to teach all human beings on the\r\nearth to live together.\r\nFor this purpose, as the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  has\r\npointed out, we must learn to know, we must learn to\r\ndo, we must learn to be. In this area, we believe that\r\nthe Economic and Social Council of our Organization\r\nmust promote and pursue its initiative for greater\r\ndissemination of technological information, as\r\nproposed by its members during the high-level segment\r\nthis year. It must try to prevent disparities in\r\ntechnological development that benefit only\r\nindustrialized countries.\r\nMillions of human beings are noting with\r\namazement that there exist realities very different from\r\ntheir own harsh conditions. When they try to travel to\r\nthat fantastic world, to that dream of hope, they find\r\nout that borders do exist and that they are free only to\r\ncontinue dreaming.\r\nGlobalization is a coin with two faces. On the one\r\nhand, it creates wealth, benefits, possibilities, but on\r\nthe other, poverty, problems, inequity and even new\r\nforms of exclusion. Instead, globalization should create\r\nfor the benefit of all a world without any exclusions.\r\nOur responsibility is to bring about the globalization of\r\nthe development of the human being.\r\nHonduras is participating in the Central American\r\nintegration process. We see this as a way of having a\r\ngreater presence and being more active in this\r\nglobalized world. This is why we actively support the\r\nstrengthening of the institutional process of Central\r\nAmerican integration.\r\nDespite the advances that occurred in the past\r\nmillennium, the terms of trade continue to work against\r\nthe development of many of our countries. The\r\nincrease in oil prices has a devastating effect on the\r\nweakest economies, and, paradoxically, the more we\r\nincrease production, the more we open our doors to\r\ninternational trade and eliminate barriers, the more\r\nobstacles we encounter to gaining access to\r\ninternational markets. This creates a crisis for our\r\nexport capacity. Trade globalization must produce\r\nbenefits in both directions.\r\nIn addition to the asymmetries and disparities to\r\nwhich I have referred, there are also threats of different\r\ntypes that no State, however powerful or strong, can\r\nsuccessfully confront in isolation. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General to the Millennium Summit attached\r\nas much importance to the topic of the environment as\r\nit did to peace and development. This demonstrates that\r\nin the year 2000 we recognize that, in addition to\r\nachieving peace and economic development, we must\r\ntake care of our environment. If we do not, the future\r\nof humanity will continue to be threatened. Every day\r\nwe are increasingly threatened by the lack of drinking\r\nwater, desertification, the destruction of the ozone\r\nlayer and climate change. These processes have\r\nproduced an increase in natural disasters. Honduras,\r\nmy country, was the victim of a disaster of catastrophic\r\nproportions. This is why we attach such priority to\r\ncaring for the environment and to education on how to\r\npromote and preserve it.\r\nThe need to control the production of greenhouse\r\ngases, the widening of the hole in the ozone layer, the\r\ndrop in oxygen production, the pollution of fresh and\r\nsalt water, the extinction of thousands of species  all\r\nthese form part of that greater concern that we must\r\nconfront jointly.\r\nSimilarly, terrorism, organized crime and drug\r\ntrafficking can be combated effectively only if we act\r\njointly and in coordination. If we do not, we will be\r\njointly responsible as accomplices in the destruction of\r\nthe hopes of the future youth and children.\r\nOur Organization should make a greater effort to\r\novercome the disparity between abundance and want,\r\nof which very concrete examples abound. For instance,\r\ntoday hundreds of thousands of medicines are\r\nproduced, but the millions of human beings affected by\r\nHIV/AIDS need access to these medicines if their pain\r\nis to be relieved. It is truly horrifying that the world\r\nproduces thousands of metric tons more food than is\r\nneeded to feed its population, and yet people are dying\r\nof hunger and malnutrition. The poverty and hunger of\r\nmillions of human beings is an insult to humanity and\r\nan affront to the dignity of individuals. Here there is\r\nroom for improved coordination.\r\nOur Organization continues its important efforts\r\nto prevent world conflicts. There have been many\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nachievements in implementing machinery for world\r\norder and peace, including peacekeeping activities and\r\nthe work of the international tribunals. We have also\r\nseen progress in disarmament, particularly in terms of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Aware of its international\r\nresponsibilities, Honduras, to the extent that its\r\nresources permit, has also contributed to international\r\npeace and security, participating in the missions in\r\nHaiti and Western Sahara.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) has also acted as a partner in the development\r\nprocess in many countries around the world. It has\r\nworked with national Governments, with society and\r\nlocal communities. UNDP is a trustworthy, active\r\npartner in the elaboration and implementation of\r\nmedium- and long-term national strategies to\r\ncontribute to the reduction of poverty. The Executive\r\nBoard meeting of UNDP, held yesterday, was very\r\nsuccessful in advancing UNDP reform. Honduras is\r\nactively participating in this process.\r\nThe world of bipolar confrontation is no longer,\r\nand the era of cooperation is under way. Nevertheless,\r\nour Organization is still leaving out States that have\r\ncontributed to development, that represent millions of\r\nbeings and that participate actively in the world\r\neconomy. For these and other reasons, which we have\r\noften cited in this General Assembly and in other\r\ninternational forums, these States should be\r\nparticipating in our debates and decisions. One such\r\nState is the Republic of China.\r\nAt the dawning of the new millennium we must\r\nstrengthen our membership, expand our representation\r\nof peoples and nations and ensure fairer and more\r\nbalanced representation in the discussions and\r\ndecisions of the Security Council. To this end,\r\nHonduras believes that the Security Council should\r\nmake room for important development partners and\r\nrepresentatives of the developing world, on the basis of\r\nequitable geographical representation and with the\r\nconsensus of the existing regional groups.\r\nWe also believe that the right to exercise the veto\r\npresently enjoyed by a limited number of States should\r\nbe confined to specific topics and circumstances, so\r\nthat it is not used merely to protect vested interests.\r\nThe new vision we have of a renewed United\r\nNations requires that our Organization become more\r\ncompetent, more agile and more responsible; that it be\r\nbetter administered, with a healthy financial system;\r\nand that it produce more tangible results for the\r\npeoples of the world. This is why we support the\r\nresults of the Working Group of the General Assembly\r\nand believe that reforming and expanding the Council\r\nmust be based on the broadest possible consensus and\r\nbe in keeping with fair and equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation, by which developing countries will be\r\nable to make substantial contributions to the decision-\r\nmaking process so as to solidify world peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nOur Organization must engage in self-criticism\r\nand be the first to propose changes to its working\r\nmethods. Thematic dialogues designed to produce\r\nconsensus and plans of action should replace the long,\r\ncostly world conferences, the concrete results of which\r\nare not always easy to see. These lofty conferences\r\nshould be replaced by a genuine debate in the General\r\nAssembly, and the procedures should be simplified so\r\nas to save the Organization the large sums that we are\r\npresently wasting because of duplication of efforts.\r\nI conclude by referring to the Millennium Summit\r\nheld just last week. I would like to recall the idea of the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras, Mr. Carlos\r\nFlores, that the United Nations can and must work to\r\nbring about the required coexistence of the poor and\r\nthe rich, the large and the small, by means of a\r\nplatform of sovereign equality and human solidarity.\r\nAnd our President said,\r\nMore than a world pained by poverty and\r\ninequity for the overwhelming majority, the world\r\nshould be the sum of its peoples with at least their\r\nbasic needs and essential requirements met.\r\n(A/55/PV.3)\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Culture, Youth and Sport of\r\nLiechtenstein, Her Excellency Ms. Andrea Willi.\r\nMs. Willi (Liechtenstein): Allow me to begin my\r\nremarks by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I wish you much success in\r\nguiding the Assembly to a fruitful outcome and I\r\npledge to you the full support of the Liechtenstein\r\ndelegation. I would also like to congratulate the newest\r\nMember, Tuvalu, on its admission to the United\r\nNations and in particular, to welcome Tuvalu into the\r\ngroup of small countries.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nI have had the honour of participating in the\r\ngeneral debate before, but this year is very special. It\r\nmarks the tenth anniversary of Liechtensteins\r\nmembership in the United Nations. I would therefore\r\nlike to include in my remarks some of the issues to\r\nwhich Liechtenstein attaches particular importance in\r\nits United Nations engagement. For Liechtenstein, as\r\nfor many other countries, the United Nations stands for\r\nthe protection of human rights and human dignity and\r\nfor the promotion of common values.\r\nThe United Nations has been particularly\r\nchallenged during the last 12 months in playing its\r\nrightful role in the pursuit of peace and security.\r\nAlthough remarkable efforts have been made, some\r\nconflict situations still do not allow for effective\r\npeacekeeping to take place. When the Secretary-\r\nGeneral called last year for a culture of prevention, my\r\ndelegation fully supported his ideas and we still believe\r\nthat the prevention of conflicts must be the key concept\r\nin the maintenance of peace. We all know that\r\npreventing conflicts can save hundreds of thousands of\r\nlives. Political energy and enormous financial\r\nresources can be used for other purposes. The term\r\nculture of prevention entails a comprehensive\r\napproach to different kinds of problems. However,\r\npreventive approaches can be perceived as a threat to\r\nthe sovereignty of a State. The classic notion of the\r\nterm obviously no longer enables us to cope with the\r\nchanged realities of the world. The sovereignty of\r\nStates remains a cornerstone of the United Nations.\r\nCreating a culture of prevention is therefore a process\r\nthat requires a concerted effort by the United Nations\r\nmembership as a whole. Addressing the root causes of\r\nso many of todays internal conflicts will constitute a\r\nfurther step in meeting this humanitarian, political and\r\neconomic necessity. Liechtenstein has for several years\r\npromoted ideas and suggestions on a preventive\r\napproach with regard to problems arising from the\r\napplication of the right of self-determination. It is time\r\nto free ourselves of biased and obsolete thinking and to\r\nrecognize that the effective application and exercise of\r\nthe right of self-determination is the basis for\r\npreventing internal conflicts and the violent\r\ndisintegration of States.\r\nThe adoption of the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998 was an\r\nhistoric step. The conclusion of the work on the\r\nelements of crimes and the rules of procedure by the\r\nPreparatory Commission this summer was a further\r\nstep forward, and the ratification process is promising.\r\nWe hope to be able to contribute to the entry into force\r\nof the Statute soon. It is of crucial importance that the\r\nintegrity of the Rome Statute be maintained throughout\r\nthe remaining work to be done by the Preparatory\r\nCommission. The qualities of the ICC have often been\r\npraised. The ICCs potential for prevention is certainly\r\none of its outstanding characteristics. An effective\r\ncriminal court will make an important contribution to\r\nterminating the practice of impunity which has\r\nprevailed for so long without being seriously\r\nchallenged.\r\nLiechtenstein has always supported enhanced\r\nUnited Nations cooperation with regional\r\norganizations, inter alia,  the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as well as the\r\nCouncil of Europe, in particular in the areas of human\r\nrights, conflict prevention and post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights\r\ncan also contribute to the prevention of conflicts. This\r\nis more than a legitimate concern for all of us  it is\r\nour duty. Ever since Liechtenstein became a Member of\r\nthe United Nations 10 years ago, this issue has been a\r\ntop priority. In recent years, human rights have become\r\nmore important in foreign policy and in the world\r\neconomy. There is increased awareness that human\r\nrights issues cannot be considered in an isolated\r\nmanner, since there is a clear connection between\r\nhuman rights and economic prosperity, social welfare,\r\nand peace and security.\r\nThe full enjoyment of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms by women must be the basis for\r\nfull equality in a stable society and we must continue\r\nto take further action in order to achieve the full\r\nadvancement and empowerment of women. Together\r\nwith 12 women Foreign Ministers, I last night signed a\r\nletter addressed to the Secretary-General in which we\r\nnoted the special needs of women in HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention, care and treatment, and called upon the\r\nUnited Nations membership to take into account the\r\nneed for an enhanced availability of education, testing,\r\ncounselling, care and treatment designed to address the\r\nspecific needs of women and girls.\r\nLiechtenstein fully supports the fight against\r\ntransnational organized crime, in particular trafficking\r\nin persons, and offences against children as well as the\r\nfight against money laundering. Financial crime is\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nincreasingly a key concern in todays open and global\r\nfinancial world, which is characterized by the high\r\nmobility of funds and the rapid development of new\r\npayment tools. In our view, international cooperation in\r\nthe global fight against money laundering can only be\r\nenhanced if all international financial services centres\r\nwork towards full implementation of internationally\r\nagreed standards, and my Government therefore fully\r\nsupports the objectives of the United Nations Global\r\nProgramme against Money Laundering (GPML)\r\nForum. The approach must, however, be transparent,\r\ninclusive and non-discriminatory, and the positive\r\naction already taken or being taken by individual\r\ncountries must be properly recognized. Any punitive\r\napproach, including the establishment of lists and the\r\nimposition of sanctions on individual jurisdictions, as\r\nwell as the failure to distinguish between the fight\r\nagainst money laundering and tax issues, runs counter\r\nto the spirit of international cooperation. We therefore\r\nregret, in particular, recent proceedings by some\r\ninternational and regional bodies directed against\r\ncertain financial centres, including Liechtenstein. The\r\nlack of transparency and the manner in which this was\r\ndone are not in conformity with the established\r\nprinciples and procedures of international cooperation.\r\nThese established principles and procedures must\r\nguide the cooperation between States and the resolution\r\nof difficulties they may have. International cooperation\r\nmust be handled in the same way when large States are\r\ndealing with small States and when small States are\r\ndealing with large States. No organization should be\r\nallowed to depart from established practice in\r\ninternational relations. Cooperation by small States\r\nmust never be interpreted as capitulation; cooperation\r\nimplies consideration of the rights and interests of all.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency Ms.\r\nNadezhda Mihailova, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBulgaria.\r\nMs. Mihailova (Bulgaria): First of all, on behalf\r\nof the Bulgarian delegation, I take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, and the other members\r\nof the presidency on assuming the particularly\r\nimportant task of presiding over this important\r\nmillennium session of the General Assembly and to\r\nwish you every success in guiding it to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nLet me start by saying that the Republic of\r\nBulgaria, as an associated country, aligns itself with the\r\nstatement delivered on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThis past year has been marked by a series of\r\nevents, culminating in the Millennium Summit. From\r\nthis General Assembly session we expect consensus\r\ndecisions aimed at a strengthened and more efficient\r\nUnited Nations, capable of bringing us closer to a\r\ncommon vision for a better future, rid of the scourge of\r\nconflict and war, poverty and disease, backwardness\r\nand under-development, and based on peace and\r\nsecurity, sustainable development and prosperity in the\r\ncontext of a dominating tendency towards a more\r\nglobalized and interdependent world. This truly is a\r\nformidable task. It cannot be achieved by or for a\r\nseparate country or region. It requires a broad and\r\nsustained effort to create a shared future, based upon\r\nour common humanity in all its diversity, as rightly\r\npointed out in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nOn the verge of the new millennium, it would not\r\nbe an exaggeration to say that humanity has achieved a\r\nlot. Nowadays we have at our disposal far better and\r\nefficient means to produce more goods and services, to\r\nfight diseases and live longer and better lives, to reap\r\nthe benefits of the new information technologies in all\r\nspheres of life. But at the same time, we cannot but\r\nrecognize that humanity is still confronted by\r\ntremendous challenges. Poverty and misery are still\r\ndominant over large parts of the world. People in so\r\nmany places are still exposed to conflict and violence.\r\nThe world is still threatened by weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. New threats, such as terrorism,\r\ninternational crime, illicit traffic in narcotics and small\r\narms, are coming to the fore. Also of particular concern\r\nare the changes in the world climate and environment,\r\nwhich are bringing disasters capable of destroying the\r\nhomes and livelihoods of millions.\r\nTo cope with these challenges we must act\r\ntogether. This is the reason why we need a\r\nstrengthened and effective United Nations, which could\r\nbe achieved through the shared responsibility and the\r\ngood political will of all its Member States. The\r\nMillennium Assembly is giving us the opportunity to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the purposes and the\r\nfounding principles of the United Nations, to go ahead\r\nwith reforms and to strengthen its role and\r\neffectiveness, so as to make it serve us all better in\r\nmeeting the challenges we are confronted with at the\r\nbeginning of the new millennium.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nBulgaria joins the other Member States in\r\nsupporting the proposals, contained in the Millennium\r\nReport of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\n(A/54/2000) and aimed at the system-wide streamlining\r\nand strengthening of the Organization and at making it\r\nmore efficient and responsive to new realities. Of\r\nparticular importance in this regard is the strengthening\r\nand revitalization of the principal organs of the United\r\nNations, in particular the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nRegarding the reform and the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council, we share the view that this process\r\nshould result in a more representative, effective and\r\nlegitimate Security Council, taking into consideration\r\nboth the increased number of the United Nations\r\nmembership and the enhanced role and political and\r\neconomic potential of certain States, like Germany and\r\nJapan, for example, which could assume the\r\nresponsibilities of permanent members. In our view, a\r\nreformed Council should be more transparent, open and\r\naccessible to the interested non-member States. A fair\r\nand balanced representation, including the Group of\r\nEastern European States, whose membership has\r\ndoubled in the last decade, should definitely be\r\nsecured. A decision on the enlargement of the Council\r\nand on its working methods should be supported by the\r\nbroadest possible consensus, including all the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council.\r\nDuring the past year, the international community\r\ncontinued to be engaged closely with the situation in\r\nsouth-east Europe. As a country, suffering most\r\ndirectly the impact of the developments in the region,\r\nBulgaria is particularly concerned with the situation in\r\nKosovo. We note that progress in implementing\r\nresolution 1244 (1999) of the Security Council has\r\nbeen achieved, particularly with regard to restoring\r\npeace and stability in the province. At the same time, it\r\nmust be recognized that in terms of multi-ethnic\r\ncoexistence the situation is still far from satisfying.\r\nContinuing ethnic violence is causing serious concern.\r\nParticularly worrying are the attacks against members\r\nof the international peacekeeping contingents and\r\nUnited Nations personnel. The situation requires\r\nresolute steps on behalf of all community leaders in\r\nKosovo to reject violence and to promote tolerance and\r\ncooperation in compliance with the adopted\r\ndeclarations. We see such an approach as a key\r\nprerequisite for building up an atmosphere of\r\nconfidence and ethnic tolerance.\r\nThe successful preparation and holding of\r\nmunicipal elections with the participation of all ethnic\r\nminorities, including refugees and displaced persons, is\r\nparticularly important for speeding up the political\r\nprocess in Kosovo and for securing lasting peace and\r\nstability.\r\nSince the very beginning of the Kosovo crisis,\r\nBulgaria has been actively engaged in the overall\r\nefforts of the international community to settle the\r\nconflict and ensure lasting peace and stability in the\r\nregion. As is well known, Bulgaria participates in the\r\ninternational peacekeeping forces in Kosovo and\r\nrenders logistical support to the peacekeeping Mission\r\nin the province. Furthermore, my country has been\r\nmobilizing significant resources, in accordance with\r\nour potential, to increase its contribution to\r\ninternational peace activities.\r\nIn response to the appeal to increase the size of\r\nthe United Nations civilian police force in Kosovo,\r\nBulgaria has increased its contingent to 60 police\r\nofficers, and is now considering the possibility of\r\nincreasing that number to 100. Bulgaria has sent an\r\nengineering platoon to join the international presence\r\nin the field. Bulgarian companies are engaged in the\r\nconstruction and assembling of houses to shelter\r\ndisplaced persons and refugees in Kosovo. Last, but\r\nnot least, Bulgaria has been supplying low-cost\r\nelectricity to Kosovo. The overall cost of these\r\nendeavours has so far reached $6 million.\r\nWe deem particularly important the involvement\r\nof all the countries of the region in the process of\r\nseeking settlement of the outstanding issues through\r\nthe process of multilateral and bilateral negotiations. In\r\nthis context, the informal meetings held at the level of\r\nprime ministers and the meetings of the foreign and\r\ndefence ministers of the countries neighbouring the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia that are devoted to\r\ndifferent aspects of cooperation are useful.\r\nOf particular importance to the post-conflict\r\nreconstruction of conflict-stricken areas is the\r\nelaboration and the implementation of a long-term\r\nstrategy for the economic reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment of the countries of the region through\r\ntheir integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic\r\nstructures. The speedy implementation of the different\r\nprojects within the framework of the Stability Pact for\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe could contribute significantly to\r\nthe economic development and stability of the region.\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nWe deem infrastructure projects as being  particularly\r\nimportant in that regard. Such projects will contribute\r\nto enhancing the transportation and communications\r\nlinks of the region and connecting them with the rest of\r\nEurope. Attracting investments and developing trade\r\nand the participation of companies from the region in\r\nthe reconstruction process are important as well.\r\nWe highly appreciate the progress achieved in\r\nstrengthening cooperation between the countries of the\r\nregion in such fields as fighting organized crime and\r\ncorruption, the illicit traffic in narcotics, curbing the\r\nuncontrolled possession of small arms, and so on. An\r\nimportant achievement of that cooperation is the\r\ncreation of a multinational peace force in south-eastern\r\nEurope, with joint headquarters in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.\r\nWe are confident that the establishment of this force\r\nwill strengthen the spirit of confidence and cooperation\r\nin the region of south-eastern Europe.\r\nAn issue of special relevance to Bulgaria and\r\nalso, I believe, for other countries of the region, is the\r\nnegative impact on the national economy of the strict\r\nimplementation of the economic sanctions imposed\r\nuntil recently by the Security Council on the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. As is well known, Bulgaria\r\nstrictly abided by the decisions of the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council, and as a result suffered economic\r\nlosses commensurate with the countrys foreign debt.\r\nThose losses still affect our economic development.\r\nGiven the continued relevance and importance of this\r\nissue under the present international setting, Bulgaria\r\nsupports the view that, since the provisions of the\r\nCharter have equal importance, the issue of assisting\r\nthird States affected by sanctions has to be taken into\r\nconsideration together with the imposition of sanctions.\r\nThe elaboration of a concrete mechanism for that\r\npurpose is therefore important for the United Nations,\r\nwhich must find ways and means of alleviating their\r\nnegative effects, in particular on third States. The\r\ninternational community as a whole should take care of\r\nthis. In our view, it is necessary that there be closer and\r\nmore direct participation in the whole process by all\r\nthird States that could potentially be adversely affected\r\nby the imposition of sanctions. We are confident that\r\nthe discussions on this issue at the present session,\r\nbased on the decisions already adopted and on the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General under resolution\r\n54/107, will result in more concrete decisions to that\r\nend.\r\nBulgaria not only supports international efforts to\r\novercome the crisis in south-eastern Europe, but it also\r\nfully supports the efforts aimed at resolving conflict\r\nsituations in Cyprus, the Middle East, the Caucuses,\r\nAfrica and elsewhere in the world. Bulgaria notes with\r\nsatisfaction the positive progress in the relations\r\nbetween South and North Korea.\r\nIn the context of the new challenges in the field\r\nof international peace and security, United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations continue to be a crucial\r\nelement in the activities of the United Nations. My\r\ncountry supports the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity aimed at ensuring the necessary tools and\r\nresources required to promote conflict prevention, the\r\npeaceful resolution of disputes, and post-conflict\r\npeace-building and reconstruction. We are convinced\r\nthat the new generation of peacekeeping operations\r\nshould include in their mandates a proportionate\r\ncombination of political, military, humanitarian,\r\nreconstruction and other relevant activities.\r\nIn this regard, we believe that there are still\r\nunexploited opportunities to strengthen the cooperation\r\nof the United Nations and to make its cooperation with\r\nregional organizations in the field of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, crisis management and peacekeeping more\r\neffective on the basis of on their competitive\r\nadvantages. We share the concern of other Member\r\nStates over ensuring the United Nations ability to\r\ndeliver on its mounting array of peacekeeping\r\ncommitments, and we are committed to work together\r\nto strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in this\r\nvital area.\r\nWe fully support the need to reform the United\r\nNations peacekeeping scale of assessments. I would\r\nlike to point out, as a clear demonstration of this fact,\r\nthat the Government of Bulgaria has decided to assume\r\nan additional financial commitment by increasing its\r\ncontribution to peacekeeping operations.\r\nAn issue closely linked to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security is the fight against\r\nterrorism and international crime. Bulgaria attaches\r\nparamount importance to the efforts of the world\r\ncommunity in the fight against terrorism. We condemn\r\nall terrorist acts and lament the loss of life and the\r\ndestruction inflicted by such acts. We share the view\r\nthat the threat of terrorism is assuming a magnitude\r\nthat requires a decisive and joint response by the whole\r\ninternational community. Bulgaria supports the\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nactivities of the United Nations aimed at setting norms\r\nand standards for the fight against terrorism and\r\ninternational crime through the negotiation of various\r\nlegal instruments and by creating appropriate\r\ninstitutions for that purpose.\r\nWe consider that the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is a significant\r\nachievement in that regard. I would like to reiterate my\r\ncountrys strong commitment to the fight against the\r\nmost serious kinds of international crime in all their\r\nforms. That commitment is a consistent part of\r\nBulgarian policy. We are confident that the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court will\r\nbe an efficient step by the international community\r\ntowards deterring the potential perpetrators from\r\ncommitting such acts.\r\nTogether with peacemaking and the building of a\r\nmore secure world, the broadening of the human aspect\r\nof development through democracy and participation\r\nhas been widely accepted and has become one of the\r\npriorities of the activities of the United Nations. The\r\nprinciple of the indivisibility of the universally\r\nrecognized civil, political, economic, social and\r\ncultural rights continues to be a key element of todays\r\nsystem of promotion and protection of human rights\r\nand freedoms. Bulgaria is confident that the activities\r\nof international forums in the field of human rights\r\nshould be aimed at ensuring the effective and universal\r\nenjoyment of those rights on a global scale.\r\nThe principle of the indivisibility of universally\r\nrecognized civil, political, economic, social and\r\ncultural rights continues to be a key element in todays\r\nsystem of promotion and protection of human rights\r\nand freedoms. Bulgaria is convinced that the activities\r\nof international forums in the field of human rights\r\nshould be aimed at ensuring the effective and universal\r\nenjoyment of those rights on a global scale. In this\r\nrespect, the monitoring and effective control of the\r\nimplementation of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms remain of crucial importance. Guided by this\r\nunderstanding, Bulgaria is now party to all universal\r\nhuman rights instruments that have established specific\r\nmonitoring bodies and has recognized their competence\r\nto consider communications from individuals.\r\nIn our view, the relevant experiences of some\r\nregional organizations with competence in the human\r\nrights field also could be taken into consideration. We\r\nshare the view that a more effective coordination and\r\nexchange of information and even joint efforts are\r\nneeded between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations such as the Council of Europe and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE).\r\nA better implementation of international\r\nstandards could be achieved by improving existing\r\nmechanisms and by constructive and open dialogue on\r\nthe most sensitive issues, including those related to\r\nhuman rights in individual States. Accordingly, the\r\nBulgarian Government attaches great importance to the\r\nenjoyment of all human rights by Bulgarians living\r\nabroad and considers respect for their rights as an\r\nessential element in the enhancement of relations.\r\nEnhanced socio-economic development is another\r\nimportant factor for securing stability and peace in the\r\nworld. The achievements registered in this field should\r\nbe recognized and encouraged. The review process,\r\nbased on the relevant ideas contained in the millennium\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, must result in the\r\nstrengthening of the coordinating role of the Economic\r\nand Social Council and of the entire machinery of this\r\nOrganization. Of particular relevance in this regard are\r\nthe steps aimed at the practical realization of the\r\nfollow-up measures to the major international\r\nconferences.\r\nBulgaria attaches major importance to the role of\r\nthe United Nations in the field of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and is following closely the United\r\nNations dialogue and the activities of the respective\r\nUnited Nations bodies and agencies on issues related to\r\ndemographics, social development, women, the fight\r\nagainst diseases and drugs, and so on.\r\nBulgaria is cooperating actively with the United\r\nNations system of specialized agencies and\r\nprogrammes. We are interested in further developing\r\nthis cooperation. We are looking forward to more\r\ndynamic and streamlined activities, especially through\r\nthe use of the potential of United Nations Development\r\nProgramme for capacity-building and assistance in the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of joint projects. In\r\nthis regard, the system of resident coordinators and the\r\nefforts to make that system more operational will\r\nundoubtedly play an important role.\r\nBulgaria shares the concern of the international\r\ncommunity regarding the spread of diseases, in\r\nparticular the AIDS virus. We support the activities of\r\nthe United Nations in this field, and we join our efforts\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nto those of Governments, non-governmental\r\norganizations, and academic and research institutions\r\nin the fight against this dangerous disease.\r\nDevelopment and economic growth are\r\nimpossible without full participation in global\r\neconomic and financial exchanges. In our opinion, the\r\nUnited Nations and its institutions could play a more\r\nactive role with regard to the specific problems related\r\nto economic transition and reforms.\r\nDisarmament issues continue to play an important\r\nrole in overall efforts to secure a better world for future\r\ngenerations. The Bulgarian Government attaches high\r\npriority to international efforts to strengthen the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. We call for an early\r\nentry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty as an important step in that direction and\r\nsupport the decision of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament to establish an ad hoc committee to\r\nconduct negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.\r\nWe favour the strengthening of the Biological and\r\nToxin Weapons Convention and believe that a further\r\nacceleration of the negotiations and an early conclusion\r\nof the protocol to the Convention is required.\r\nAs a State party to the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention, Bulgaria would like to contribute to\r\nincreasing the number of accessions to the Convention\r\nin order to achieve recognition of the prohibition of\r\nchemical weapons as a universal norm of international\r\nlaw. As a concrete effort to this end, we are hosting a\r\nregional seminar of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons in Sofia from 28 to\r\n30 September of this year.\r\nWith regard to conventional arms, anti-personnel\r\nlandmines are widely recognized as a terrible weapon,\r\nwhich kills and maims hundreds of thousands of people\r\nworldwide. Convinced of the need for a total\r\nprohibition of anti-personnel mines, on 29 July 1999\r\nthe Bulgarian Parliament ratified the Ottawa\r\nConvention, thus contributing to its early entry into\r\nforce.\r\nWe are also ready to contribute to the efforts of\r\nthe international community to reduce conventional\r\nweapons, including small arms, especially their\r\nexcessive and destabilizing accumulation in areas of\r\nconflict. We regard universal participation in the\r\nUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms as an\r\nimportant step towards effective transparency, on both\r\na regional and a global scale.\r\nFor Bulgaria this past year has been a period of\r\ncontinued intensive efforts by the Government to build\r\non the economic stabilization that has been achieved\r\nand to move forward with structural reforms,\r\nmodernizing State administration, enforcing the rule of\r\nlaw in civil society and creating favourable conditions\r\nfor sustainable economic growth. The steps and\r\ninitiatives that have been undertaken in compliance\r\nwith the Government programme Bulgaria  2001\r\nare directed at moving ahead with the integration of\r\nBulgaria into European and Euro-Atlantic structures.\r\nBeing an integral part of Europe, Bulgaria regards\r\naccelerated accession to the European Union and full\r\nmembership in North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) as an expression of our sovereign political\r\nchoice based on broad public support. Since Bulgaria is\r\nendeavouring to promote and enhance the values of\r\ndemocracy, we are sincerely interested in seeing these\r\nvalues become widely accepted throughout South-\r\neastern Europe. The Republic of Bulgaria welcomes its\r\ninclusion in the process of enlargement of the European\r\nUnion, together with other associated countries from\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus. The\r\nBulgarian Government is fully aware that our accession\r\nendeavours are contingent on the success of domestic\r\neconomic and legislative reforms.\r\nThe Bulgarian Government has developed a\r\nclear-cut national strategy to meet the criteria for\r\nNATO membership, based on a comprehensive national\r\nprogramme of preparation, which is being updated and\r\noptimized. Bulgaria has the political will and is\r\nundertaking concrete steps to translate and fulfil in\r\nregional terms the objectives of the Euro-Atlantic\r\nPartnership Council and the enhanced Partnership for\r\nPeace. Our positive attitude is reflected in the ongoing\r\nregional political dialogue and the practical follow-up\r\nmeasures to enhance regional security and defence\r\ncooperation in South-eastern Europe.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to declare\r\nmy countrys readiness to cooperate actively with all\r\nMember States for the successful implementation of\r\nthe lofty goals which we have before us at the present\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\r\ndiscussions on important agenda items will be\r\ntranslated into practical measures.\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Colombia, His Excellency Mr.\r\nGuillermo Fernández de Soto.\r\nMr. Fernández de Soto (Colombia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at the\r\ncurrent session. I am confident that under your able\r\nguidance our deliberations will yield success. I also\r\nwish to thank your predecessor for his leadership and\r\nfor the his exemplary work as President of the\r\nAssembly during the fifty-fourth session. I also have\r\nthe honour to extend convey my greetings to the\r\nSecretary-General and to acknowledge his firm\r\nleadership and his continuing interest in the search for\r\npractical and innovative solutions.\r\nFor Colombia, this session represents a historic\r\nchallenge: the challenge to forge new relationships\r\naimed at carrying out the mission agreed upon by heads\r\nof State or Government at the Millennium Summit.\r\nThey have defined the parameters of the world in\r\nwhich we wish to live and the conditions for creating a\r\nnew international political and economic order. My\r\ncountry had the honour to submit the Cartagena de\r\nIndias Declaration (A/54/929), a commitment adopted\r\nby heads of State of the Rio Group, which enunciates\r\nthe aspirations of our region and is an exceptional\r\ncontribution to the future of the United Nations. We\r\nwill now undertake a careful follow-up of these\r\ninitiatives so as to translate them into realities for the\r\nbenefit of humankind.\r\nPerhaps the dawn of the new millennium will\r\nenable us to face this challenge with optimism, to\r\nsignal a break with the legacy of half a century and\r\nwith the many proposals that have so often met with\r\nindifference. It represents an opportunity to translate\r\nour collective aspirations into tangible reality.\r\nIn large part, our expectations relate to the\r\nmeaning and scope of globalization. Sweeping\r\nrevolutions are taking place in the fields of\r\ntransportation, communication and the electronic\r\nmedia. Every day we are astonished by advances in\r\ntechnology and by the discoveries of applied science.\r\nThe main purpose of the United Nations and of its\r\nvarious forums and agencies is to channel this\r\nenormous store of technological and scientific\r\nknowledge towards the poorest and most vulnerable\r\nsectors of the population.\r\nInformation technology is bringing structural\r\nchange to the international economy and unprecedented\r\nopportunities to promote creative cultural interaction\r\namong peoples. But the information revolution can also\r\nbecome a source of exclusion. We face the risk of\r\ncreating a new form of illiteracy: cyber-illiteracy. We\r\nmust bridge the digital divide and convert information\r\ntechnology into a positive factor for education and\r\npoverty-reduction so that the information revolution\r\nmay become truly global. Failure to do so will increase\r\nthe gap between rich and poor.\r\nOne of our principal challenges is therefore to\r\nglobalize globalization and to make it an imperative for\r\nthe twenty-first century. It is, in other words, to bring\r\nthe benefits of this process to more regions, nations\r\nand individuals by democratizing access to new\r\ntechnologies, eliminating barriers to trade and\r\ninvestment and recognizing that the resources with\r\nwhich nature provides us are the common heritage of\r\nfuture generations.\r\nHere, preservation of the environment is a key\r\nelement. We have an obligation to respect nature and to\r\nbuild a sustainable future. We must put an end to the\r\ndestruction being caused by the irrational use of natural\r\nresources and by unsound patterns of consumption and\r\nproduction. This requires greater political commitment\r\nto control climate change, eliminate sources of water\r\npollution and put an end to the loss of our forests. The\r\nprovision of financial resources and transfer of\r\nenvironmentally safe technologies are issues still to be\r\nresolved. The international community must honour the\r\ncommitments it has assumed in this field before it is\r\ntoo late.\r\nFor their part, the United Nations and the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions must develop a new\r\nframework to prevent and respond to risks and\r\neconomic crises. We need a stable, ordered, transparent\r\nand predictable financial system, one in which we can\r\nstrengthen our early warning capacity, effectively\r\ncontrol the volatility of capital flows and ensure\r\nsufficient liquidity to provide timely support to\r\ncountries affected by crisis. Another urgent priority is\r\nto create social protection networks that can be used in\r\ntimes of financial crisis.\r\nThe beginning of the millennium is marked also\r\nby new concerns and threats to peace and security. The\r\nproliferation and illicit trade in small arms is one of\r\nthese. The illegal traffic in such arms has reached\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nunacceptable proportions; its impact has been even\r\nmore devastating than that of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Despite this, the international community\r\nis not giving it the importance and priority which this\r\ngrave problem demands. Urgent and effective measures\r\nare needed to halt and completely eliminate this illegal\r\ntrade.\r\nCountries affected by this phenomenon must not\r\nremain exposed to the criminal activities of the\r\nnetworks of arms traffickers who, taking advantage of\r\nthe absence of monitoring and oversight mechanisms,\r\nare causing irreparable damage to our societies.\r\nGovernments have the political and moral\r\nresponsibility to act decisively against illicit arms\r\nexports and to bring all the force of the law to bear\r\nagainst the merchants of death and violence who profit\r\nfrom this nefarious trade. My country, Colombia, has\r\npaid a very high price in human lives as a consequence\r\nof this criminal activity.\r\nCountries that are exporters of small arms must\r\nestablish controls on intermediaries and refrain from\r\nauthorizing sales if there is a risk of improper use.\r\nThere is a need for greater transparency and for the\r\nexchange of information on the modalities and routes\r\nof this trade. We must urgently create mechanisms to\r\nprovide financial and technical assistance so that\r\naffected countries will be better able to implement\r\neffective controls. We have a responsibility to ensure\r\nthat the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade\r\nin Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects, to\r\nbe held in 2001, results in concrete commitments and\r\neffective action.\r\nThe global problem of illicit drugs, for its part,\r\ncontinues to be one of the most serious threats of our\r\ntime. It is a factor for violence and corruption,\r\neconomic disruption and impoverishment, erosion of\r\nthe social fabric and instability in democracies. It is\r\nalso a cause of alarming environmental disasters.\r\nNo nation has suffered as tragically as Colombia\r\nfrom the consequences of this global problem. Every\r\nday, lives are lost in Colombia through the action of\r\noutlaw groups whose activities are financed from\r\nresources obtained from the traffic in drugs. Now,\r\nwhen all our efforts are focused on the difficult battle\r\nagainst this problem, we need increased support and\r\nthe effective solidarity of the international community.\r\nOnly by accepting and fully implementing the\r\nprinciple of shared responsibility will humankind be\r\nable to free itself from the scourge of illicit drugs. We\r\nask for no more. Let us all assume the cost that is our\r\nshare to bear in order to wipe this illegal activity from\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\nColombia is making extraordinary efforts to\r\nadvance towards a solution to its internal conflict. It is\r\na fundamental objective that we will never renounce.\r\nWe are aware that the building of peace takes time, but\r\nwe are making steady progress. In the midst of the\r\ncomplexities of our situation in Colombia, and despite\r\nthe cruelty of the present conflict, we have made\r\nprogress in confidence-building, in the dialogue, in the\r\ndiscussion of the thematic agendas and in the\r\nparticipation of civil society. We know full well that\r\nthe achievement of peace requires in-depth action in\r\nthe economic and social fields that could give real and\r\nlasting content to these efforts.\r\nA number of countries have joined in this\r\nprocess, at the request of the Government. Today,\r\npeace in Colombia is important for the world. I appeal\r\nto the international community to reaffirm its solidarity\r\nand offer its material support to our peace process.\r\nOne of the most important developments of the\r\nlast two decades has been the increasing commitment\r\nto respect for human rights. We have made some\r\nprogress in defining economic and social rights as an\r\nindivisible component of so-called traditional rights or\r\nindividual freedoms. The old objections that prevented\r\nus from proclaiming the universal validity and\r\napplication of human rights are gradually losing way\r\nand States have accepted their responsibility for\r\nensuring compliance.\r\nIn recent years, civil conflicts have become a\r\nmajor expression of violence. International\r\nhumanitarian law is essential to deal with the\r\nconsequences of these confrontations. Its enforcement,\r\nhowever, requires agreement on the minimum rules of\r\nrespect for the civil population and the interests of\r\nStates. The key to that enforcement is that\r\nhumanitarian law  its postulates, norms and\r\nmechanisms  should be equally applied by all parties\r\nin conflict.\r\nThe movements of people, including refugees or\r\nmigrants, must also be recognized as a priority issue.\r\nThey are protected by a concrete framework of human\r\nrights. In a world that promotes the free movement of\r\ncapital and free trade, it is unacceptable that unjustified\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nrestrictions continue to be applied to the movement of\r\npeople.\r\nThe solution to concrete problems on the\r\ninternational agenda necessarily requires concerted\r\naction and multilateralism; Colombia has always been\r\nand will continue to be firmly committed to it. We\r\nbelieve that this multilateralism can be supplemented\r\nby convergent regional initiatives and bilateralism as\r\npart of an approach to reduce distances and\r\nimbalances  in other words, a multilateralism that\r\nserves as a bridge for rapprochement, solidarity and\r\nshared responsibility, concepts upon which the entire\r\nbuilding of the contemporary international order must\r\nbe constructed.\r\nOur peoples, in whose name the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations was conceived, yearn to see how the\r\nfulfilment of the purposes and functions of the United\r\nNations can be reflected in the satisfaction of their\r\nhopes and aspirations. Even though in many respects\r\nwe are still far from this objective, we must preserve\r\nthe gains achieved. An attitude of passivity is not\r\nconvenient for the Organization. This Assembly must\r\nadopt decisions to reactivate the process of United\r\nNations reform, on realistic grounds, but without\r\nfurther delaying the measures that require urgent\r\nimplementation. There are many initiatives that can be\r\nrealized without the need for reform of the Charter. The\r\nonly thing required is the will to show solidarity and to\r\nmake timely political decisions.\r\nThe United Nations acts as the worlds\r\nconscience, requiring greater priority in order to meet\r\nthe needs of the poor countries. Strategies must be\r\nurgently developed to mobilize funds to remove the\r\ncauses of underdevelopment. The growing gap between\r\nthe wealth of the prosperous and the poverty of those\r\nwho are marginalized from progress is in itself an\r\nappeal for attention which should be listened to and\r\nshould lead to the translation of words into deeds.\r\nIn this connection, we welcome the growing role\r\nbeing played by non-governmental organizations,\r\nwhose activities should be accompanied by a proper\r\ndefinition of their responsibilities. For their part, the\r\ntransnational corporations, which play such an\r\nimportant function in the global economy, should give\r\nserious consideration to the United Nations through\r\nfinancial support to the Organization, which is in\r\nurgent need of additional resources. This support could\r\nwell be channelled towards United Nations poverty-\r\nreduction programmes.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council continues to\r\nbe one of the principal reforms anticipated from the\r\nexpected adjustment of multilateral political\r\ninstitutions. But in this area we need a gradual, less\r\nmaximalist approach. Formulas must be explored to\r\nensure greater participation of developing countries.\r\nWe must take effective steps to promote greater\r\nrepresentativity in the Council, on the understanding\r\nthat this does not constitute a privilege, but rather a\r\nresponsibility. Broader regional representation,\r\nrestrictions on the use of the veto and greater\r\ntransparency in the decision-making process could\r\nbring the Security Council closer to a reality that is not\r\nthe same now in the twenty-first century as it was in\r\n1945.\r\nThe election of new members to the Council will\r\ntake place in a few weeks. Colombia has the support of\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean to be elected as a\r\nnon-Permanent Member of this important organ. Once\r\nour entry is approved by the General Assembly, we will\r\nassume this responsibility as of 1 January. It will be an\r\nopportunity to reaffirm Colombias commitment to, and\r\nconfidence in, multilateralism and its resolute and\r\nunconditional commitment to the norms and principles\r\nof international law. We will also reaffirm our\r\nconviction that peaceful and negotiated solutions to\r\ndisputes and respect for international humanitarian law\r\nby all parties to a conflict are essential in order to build\r\nfirm and lasting foundations for peace and security. We\r\nwill promote better functioning of the Council,\r\nespecially in terms of information and consultation\r\nwith States that are not part of that organ, and we will\r\nfoster a more permanent and closer relationship with\r\nthe General Assembly as the supreme organ of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nNever before has humankind had the prospect\r\nlike the one now afforded at the beginning of the new\r\nmillennium to make steady progress towards peace,\r\nprogress and international stability. It is an opportunity\r\nfor the leaders of the world to make a decisive political\r\nstep in that direction. Let us give our peoples new hope\r\nthat the change in the millennium will signify not\r\nmerely a chronological change but also the beginning\r\nof a true political and social transformation. Only thus\r\nwill future generations recognize that we had the\r\ncourage to assume our obligations with responsibility.\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.11\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nWould anybody wish to take the floor at this\r\nstage?\r\nI see none.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.40 p.m.\r\n"
