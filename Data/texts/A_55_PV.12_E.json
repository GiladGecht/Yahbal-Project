(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 122 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/55/345/Add.3)\r\nThe President: In a letter contained in document\r\nA/55/345/Add.3, the Secretary-General informs me\r\nthat, since the issuance of his communications\r\ncontained in document A/55/345 and addenda 1 and 2,\r\nCape Verde has made the necessary payment to reduce\r\nits arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of\r\nthe Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly\r\ntakes note of the information contained in that\r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, His Excellency The Honourable\r\nSam Condor.\r\nMr. Condor (Saint Kitts and Nevis): The\r\ndelegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis congratulates you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. We pledge our full\r\nsupport and our assistance in the work ahead. Permit\r\nme also to pay tribute to the work of your predecessor,\r\nwho took us through a challenging fifty-fourth session.\r\nAs the new Foreign Minister of Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis, I am deeply honoured to be addressing the\r\nAssembly at this historic moment of increasing\r\nexpectations at the national level. At the same time, we\r\nsalute the dawn of this millennium with consternation\r\nin the face of the unprecedented challenges that\r\nconfront us.\r\nThe United Nations has matured in the past five\r\ndecades, but we recognize that this is an institution\r\nwhere maturity cannot be measured in days or decades.\r\nThe maturity of which I speak should be measured by\r\nthe quality of our commitment and the depth of our\r\nvision.\r\nThe phenomenon of globalization has been\r\ncharacterized by growth in the level of trade, increased\r\nflows of capital, and advanced technology. Although\r\nwe do not question this reality, we are cognizant of the\r\ninherent challenges and inequalities of globalization\r\nresulting from our varied levels of development. Small\r\nisland developing States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nhave yet to access a significant share of the vaunted\r\nbenefits that globalization has brought in its wake. We\r\ncontinue to bear a disproportionate share of its costs\r\nwhile experiencing continuous marginalization due to\r\nour small size and to the volatility of financial flows.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to influence\r\ndeveloped countries to improve market conditions for\r\nexports from small developing States, which are\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nespecially vulnerable. We are inclined to ask the\r\npertinent question: Why is globalization, with all its\r\ninherent benefits, not improving the lot of the poor\r\namong us?\r\nIt is evident that globalization is creating new\r\nscenarios on our landscape; as these new situations\r\nemerge, we must develop new strategies to remain\r\nrelevant. What is critical, therefore, is the need for\r\nincreased cooperation among Member States in our\r\nefforts to secure our various interests.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would like to stress the\r\nimperative of giving the United Nations the political\r\nimpetus necessary to address the inequalities\r\ncharacterizing inter-State relations. This Organization,\r\nwith its tradition of democracy, should resolve the\r\nanomalies created by globalization. We welcome the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General intended to\r\nensure that this multifaceted phenomenon will work to\r\nthe advantage of small island developing States. We\r\nintend to persevere in our efforts to adopt the requisite\r\nmacroeconomic policies. However, effective\r\ngovernance and cooperation at the global level must\r\ncomplement our democratic will and our political will\r\nat the national level.\r\nWe should commit ourselves to strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations as the multilateral institution which\r\nprovides a forum of inclusion. We shall also persist in\r\nour efforts to ensure the development of mechanisms\r\nand modalities to make possible equitable results. In\r\nparticular, we urge the use of a vulnerability index to\r\nbe factored into any assessment of small island States\r\nby the United Nations and by international\r\ndevelopment and financial institutions.\r\nAs for globalization and governance, Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis is concerned by the recent action taken by\r\nthe financial action task force of the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\r\ncountries, which has sought to put pressure on the\r\nalready weakened economies of several Caribbean\r\nStates, including Saint Kitts and Nevis. In recent times,\r\nmany of us, in our efforts to diversify our economies,\r\nhave undertaken to build a strong financial service\r\nsector. But sadly, as I speak, my people find\r\nthemselves, along with the collective populations of\r\nfour other Caribbean neighbours, assaulted through\r\nnegative advisories.\r\nWe urge the United Nations, through the\r\nSecretary-General, to impress upon OECD countries\r\nthat unilateral attempts to effect multilateral solutions\r\nin their own self-interest weaken the democratic fibre\r\nof international relations. We urge, therefore, that any\r\ndiscussion on the development strategies of countries\r\nlarge or small must be raised to the level of inclusive\r\ndiscussions or multilateral forums.\r\nWe would like to emphasize that there is no harm\r\nin a competitive, well regulated, supervised financial\r\nservice sector. However, a unilateral challenge to the\r\nsovereign rights of States to implement legal tax\r\nregimes is an unwarranted attack on the integrity of\r\nthose States. We believe that the development of the\r\nfinancial services sector holds valuable opportunities\r\nfor small developing countries. We understand also the\r\nneed for due diligence and for appropriate checks and\r\nbalances to frustrate and deter money laundering.\r\nThe coupling of the financial services sector and\r\nmoney laundering without distinguishing between the\r\ntwo does grave injustice to a legitimate economic\r\nenterprise. Saint Kitts and Nevis is committed to\r\nensuring that no individual or entity abuses our\r\nfinancial services sector for illicit purposes. To that\r\nend, we have enacted legislation and have established a\r\nfinancial intelligence unit. We will be vigilant and will\r\ncontinue to take the necessary steps to keep this sector\r\nfree from abuse. Members can thus see that we are\r\naware of the difference, and that we are committed to\r\nensuring that our jurisdiction complies with\r\ninternational standards.\r\nThe convening earlier this year of the special\r\nsession on the World Summit for Social Development\r\nallowed us to focus attention on the human face of\r\npoverty, which is overlooked by globalization. While\r\nwe, as developing countries, continue to adopt a\r\nproactive approach to our social development agenda,\r\nthe United Nations, through its specialized agencies,\r\nshould continue to support national poverty reduction\r\nprogrammes so as to promote favourable economic and\r\nfinancial opportunities for all young people.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, therefore, regards as\r\ncritical the meeting on financing for development,\r\nscheduled for the year 2001. We hope that it will\r\nprovide the appropriate opportunity to adopt measures\r\nto strengthen the international financial system; this\r\ncould ensure long-term access to resources and\r\ntechnical assistance.\r\nSt. Kitts and Nevis welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative for the establishment of a disaster\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nresponse programme that would complement the\r\nresilience of our people to contribute to effective and\r\ntimely reconstruction efforts. However, the impact\r\nfrom man-made disasters is even more devastating. The\r\nfrequent passage through our waters of shipments of\r\ntoxic and hazardous waste poses a serious threat to our\r\nfragile ecosystems. We urge the United Nations to\r\nassume a greater role in mobilizing support within the\r\ninternational community to implement this policy. We\r\nhave to take action to avert the threat of pollution from\r\nship-generated waste, as well as accidental release of\r\nhazardous and noxious substances.\r\nWe regard the progress achieved in promoting\r\nwomen in development as vital to the global agenda of\r\nhuman rights. Hence, St. Kitts and Nevis welcomed the\r\nconvening this year of the special session on the status\r\nof women, which allowed Member States to review and\r\nassess the progress made since the Beijing Declaration\r\nand Plan of Action.\r\nMy Government is currently implementing a new\r\ngender management system and has introduced\r\nmeasures to ensure that the national budget and\r\ndevelopment programmes are more gender sensitive.\r\nWe are committed to strengthening and promoting the\r\nmainstreaming of a gender perspective at all levels.\r\nThere has been much debate about the critical\r\nrole of information technology in bridging the global\r\ndigital divide. We welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal for a United Nations Information Technology\r\nService, which could go a long way towards our efforts\r\nto sustain our future through capacity-building.\r\nIn the Group of 77 Summit convened earlier this\r\nyear, the developing countries committed to\r\nstrengthening South-South cooperation through the\r\ntransfer of knowledge and technology. St. Kitts and\r\nNevis intends to forge ahead on the information super-\r\nhighway. My Government has embarked on a\r\nprogramme to make each child in St. Kitts and Nevis\r\ncomputer literate by the year 2005. We encourage\r\ndeveloped countries to use the availability of\r\nappropriate technologies, not only to generate wealth\r\nfor themselves but also to advance the economic and\r\nsocial well being of the citizens of the world. In the\r\nwords of Dr. Martin Luther King,\r\n“Through our scientific genius we have made the\r\nworld a neighbourhood; now, through our moral\r\nand spiritual development, we must make it a\r\nbrotherhood”.\r\nThe plethora of issues on the United Nations\r\nagenda is complex and involved. Indeed, these\r\nchallenges sometimes even exceed the capacity of\r\nindividual States. Therefore, we need to harness the\r\ncollaborative energies of States and non-State actors to\r\ncope with the fundamental changes in the world. This\r\nOrganization should be guided by the foresight of\r\nPresident Truman who, in reference to the Charter,\r\nstated,\r\n“The Charter will be expanded and improved as\r\ntime goes on. Changing world conditions will\r\nrequire readjustments”.\r\nChange is the only constant. St. Kitts and Nevis\r\nencourages Member States to recognize the importance\r\nof change as we embrace the true concept of\r\ndemocracy within the Security Council. The\r\nundemocratic structure and lack of fairness within the\r\nSecurity Council threaten to undermine Member\r\nStates’ commitment and trust in the Organization.\r\nEven as we forge ahead into a new millennium,\r\nwe still are witnessing some of the most gruesome\r\nforms of man’s inhumanity. War and other inter-State\r\nconflict still litter the landscape of many societies\r\nthroughout the world. We must continue to support\r\npeacekeeping operations to ensure that the rhetoric of\r\nviolence is silenced. The concepts of peace-making and\r\npeacekeeping must also be complemented by the\r\nimperatives of development. Once we have established\r\npeace, we must also lay the foundation to support\r\nlasting peace.\r\nWe welcome and congratulate the State of\r\nTuvalu, admitted at the opening of this fifty-fifth\r\nregular session. As a vulnerable small island Caribbean\r\ndeveloping State, St. Kitts and Nevis is pleased to\r\nwelcome another vulnerable small State from the\r\nPacific, convinced that it is seized of its obligations to\r\nuphold the principles of the Charter.\r\nIn addition, St. Kitts and Nevis reiterates its call\r\nfor discussion of the Chinese people on Taiwan. Again,\r\nwe  emphasize that our policy seeks to promote respect\r\nfor the sovereignty of States. However, as we reflect on\r\nthe mission of this institution, we deem it appropriate\r\nto consider the invaluable contribution of the 23\r\nmillion Chinese people on Taiwan who can add great\r\nsubstance to international discourse.\r\nThis Millennium Assembly affords us the\r\nopportunity to reflect on the Secretary-General’s\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nreport, which focuses on the world’s people and the\r\nUnited Nations role in ensuring their well-being.\r\nWe welcome the importance attributed to peace\r\nand security on the agenda of the United Nations and\r\nwelcome the proclamation of the year 2000 as the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace. We further\r\napplaud the decision to declare the decade beginning in\r\n2001 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace\r\nand Non-violence for the Children of the World. Our\r\nchildren are our future; the new millennium belongs to\r\nthem. It behooves us to dissipate the ominous clouds\r\non the horizon of their dreams so they can awaken to a\r\nworld free of fear.\r\nThe experts contend that there is an obvious\r\ncorrelation between the persistence of poverty and poor\r\nhealth.\r\nThe statistical reports on HIV/AIDS paint a\r\nsinister picture. Saint Kitts and Nevis is disturbed by\r\nthe rapid increase in the number of persons infected\r\nwith the HIV/AIDS virus and its economic and social\r\nconsequences for growth in developing countries. This\r\ndisease does not recognize national boundaries and\r\nthreatens to undermine future economic and social\r\ndevelopment in many of our nations. We look forward\r\nto a United Nations special session on HIV/AIDS to\r\nintensify and better coordinate our approaches at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nDespite all its shortcomings, the United Nations\r\nhas a critical role to play in the international system.\r\nWithout the United Nations, many small States like\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would lose a champion of\r\ncollective interests. That is unacceptable. One of the\r\nmost valuable gifts to humanity in the last millennium\r\nhas been the United Nations. We must therefore\r\ncommit ourselves to preserving it.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nTang Jiaxuan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China.\r\nMr. Tang Jiaxuan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nPlease allow me to extend my warm congratulations to\r\nyou, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its current session. I am confident\r\nthat, with your wisdom and experience, and with the\r\nsupport and coordinated efforts of the member States,\r\nthe Millennium Assembly will successfully complete\r\nall its work. At the same time, I would like to express\r\nmy appreciation and thanks to Mr. Gurirab for the\r\ncontribution he made as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its last session.\r\nThe Millennium Summit, which attracted\r\nworldwide attention, has just concluded. The United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration is a consensus reached\r\nby world leaders on how to meet the major challenges\r\nfacing mankind today. The Declaration reviews and\r\nsums up the course that the United Nations has\r\ntravelled over the past 55 years. More importantly, it\r\noffers a blueprint for the United Nations in the new\r\ncentury and the new millennium and important\r\nguidance to people around the world in their pursuit of\r\npeace, development and common progress. I would like\r\nto add my voice to the call to action made by\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan at the closing ceremony\r\nof the Summit. We should work together to turn the\r\nconsensus reached at the Summit into action and usher\r\nin a new era of peace and development for people all\r\nover the world.\r\nIt is the primary mission of the United Nations in\r\nthe new century to uphold the purposes and principles\r\nof its Charter, promote democracy in international\r\nrelations, maintain world peace and stability and\r\nfacilitate the development and prosperity of all\r\ncountries. The United Nations Charter is a\r\nmanifestation of the peoples’ aspiration to equality,\r\njustice and freedom. Over the past 55 years, the United\r\nNations has adhered to the Charter aims of\r\nsafeguarding peace, developing friendship and\r\npromoting cooperation, as well as the core principles\r\nguiding international relations, such as sovereign\r\nequality and non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates. It is precisely for these reasons that the United\r\nNations has grown in strength and its membership\r\nincreased from 51 to 189. This Organization is still\r\nplaying an irreplaceable role in world affairs.\r\nThe history of the past 55 years has amply proved\r\nthe effectiveness of the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Today, global issues have\r\nmade our interests intertwined and modern technology\r\nhas made our communication easier. In these\r\ncircumstances, we need more than ever to face our\r\ncommon challenges together on the basis of equality,\r\nmutual respect and democratic consultation. The\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter are by no means\r\noutdated, but are rather of greater relevance today.\r\nDemocracy in international relations requires\r\ncompliance with the principle of sovereign equality, as\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nprovided for in the United Nations Charter. Countries\r\ndiffer in size, strength and wealth, but they are all\r\nequal members of the international community. None\r\nshould be discriminated against and their state\r\nsovereignty brooks no encroachment. The internal\r\naffairs of a country should be managed by the people of\r\nthat country and major world affairs should be decided\r\nby all countries through consultation. The response to\r\nglobal challenges calls for worldwide cooperation and\r\ncoordination. This is a necessity of our times and a\r\nprerequisite for the establishment of a fair and just new\r\ninternational political order. It is also the foundation\r\nand source of vitality for the United Nations in the new\r\ncentury.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations should give full\r\nexpression to democracy in international relations. The\r\nreform is aimed at better safeguarding the fundamental\r\nrights and interests of all Member States and,\r\nespecially, at truly reflecting the will of developing\r\ncountries, which make up the bulk of United Nations\r\nmembership. It should not merely satisfy the needs of a\r\nfew countries. The reform of the Security Council\r\nshould seek primarily to increase representation of\r\ndeveloping countries and should be based on extensive\r\ndeliberations among Member States. It is against the\r\nwill of the overwhelming majority of Member States to\r\nset arbitrar deadlines or to force the passage of\r\nimmature plans.\r\nThere is general agreement among the United\r\nNations Member States on basing the scale\r\nmethodology of regular budget and peacekeeping\r\nassessment on the principle of the capacity to pay. This\r\nmethodology is also one that has been confirmed time\r\nand again by the General Assembly through its\r\nresolutions and should therefore be abided by in\r\nwhatever circumstances. Any adjustment to this\r\nmethodology should take into full account the specific\r\neconomic conditions of developing countries. Such\r\nadjustments should be made only when there is\r\nconsensus among all Member States through extensive\r\nconsultation, thus facilitating the normal and sound\r\noperation of the United Nations.\r\nAnother important historical task facing the\r\nUnited Nations is to respond to globalization and to\r\nachieve the common development of mankind. The\r\ntwentieth century has seen both unprecedented\r\neconomic prosperity and the greatest polarization. In\r\nthe last decade of the century, economic globalization\r\nhas advanced at the fastest pace, while the gap between\r\nthe North and the South has continued to widen.\r\nAccording to the World Bank, the revenue of the low-\r\nincome countries accounts for only 6 per cent of the\r\nworld’s total, although they make up more than half of\r\nthe world’s population, while that of the developed\r\ncountries is 80 per cent with only one sixth of the\r\nworld population.\r\nIt is especially worrisome that there is an even\r\nwider gap between developing and developed countries\r\nin the field of advanced technology. The new economy\r\nis so far benefiting only the rich countries. Most\r\ndeveloping countries are still information have-nots.\r\nShould this situation be allowed to continue, many\r\ndeveloping countries will long remain deprived of the\r\nopportunity to participate in technological progress and\r\neconomic growth and the world will be further\r\npolarized.\r\nTo prevent poverty from swallowing up\r\nachievements of development and to prevent social\r\ninjustice from shaking the basis of global stability, the\r\nUnited Nations must play its due role in narrowing the\r\ngap between the rich and the poor and bringing about\r\ncommon prosperity to the world. It is an unavoidable\r\nmajor responsibility of the United Nations in the new\r\ncentury to promote the establishment of a new\r\ninternational economic order based on cooperation on\r\nan equal footing and aimed at common development\r\nand to ensure that economic globalization benefits\r\neverybody in the world.\r\nThe United Nations should give top priority to the\r\nissue of development, make efforts to change the\r\ncurrent situation in which global economic affairs are\r\ndominated by only a few countries and ensure\r\ndeveloping countries their right to equal participation\r\nin economic decision-making. In making or revising\r\nglobal economic rules of the game, consideration\r\nshould first be given to the need of developing\r\ncountries in order to facilitate their development and\r\nreduce the risks they may face when participating in\r\nglobalization. The United Nations should also mobilize\r\nall the resources available and encourage the\r\ninternational community to narrow the “digital divide”,\r\nand it should help developing countries to seize, as far\r\nas they can, the opportunities brought about by the\r\nscientific and technological advancement driven by the\r\ninformation revolution. The United Nations also has\r\nthe responsibility for introducing new rules to the\r\nworld to make science and technology truly serve all of\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nmankind and the lofty cause of peace and development\r\nin the world.\r\nAs drastic and profound changes are taking place\r\nin the international situation, what kind of security\r\nconcept should be embraced is a major subject before\r\nthe United Nations and all its Member States. Global\r\nstrategic stability is the foundation on which world\r\nsecurity rests. And the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile\r\n(ABM) Treaty is an important cornerstone for global\r\nstrategic stability. Any move to undermine the totality\r\nand effectiveness of the Treaty will have a profound\r\nnegative impact on world peace and security. The\r\nproposal for a national missile defence system that is\r\nprohibited by the ABM Treaty is essentially aimed at\r\nseeking unilateral military and strategic supremacy, and\r\nthus a typical example of the cold war mentality. Such\r\na plan, if implemented, will only bring serious negative\r\nconsequences to the security of the whole world. The\r\nadoption by the General Assembly of the resolution on\r\npreservation of and compliance with the ABM Treaty\r\n(A/54/54 A) at its fifty-fourth session by an\r\noverwhelming majority is an indicator of the firm will\r\nof most countries in the world to maintain and strictly\r\nobserve the ABM Treaty. The United Nations should\r\ncontinue to show serious concern over the attempt by a\r\ncertain country to develop a missile defence system to\r\nthe detriment of global strategic stability, and it should\r\ntake necessary measures to stop this dangerous\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSecurity is mutual and relative. No country\r\nshould enhance its security at the expense of that of the\r\nothers. To seek absolute unilateral security is not\r\nfeasible and will lead to greater insecurity. With\r\nincreased international contacts and exchanges,\r\ncountries of the world will find themselves sharing\r\nmore common interests and facing more common\r\nchallenges. Security can only be realized through\r\ndialogue on an equal footing and in the spirit of mutual\r\nunderstanding and mutual accommodation. It can only\r\nbe maintained on the basis of mutual respect and\r\npeaceful coexistence, and it can only be consolidated\r\nthrough mutually beneficial cooperation and common\r\ndevelopment. The only way to protect the fundamental\r\ninterests of all countries and enhance universal security\r\nis to replace the old security concept based on military\r\nalliances and military build-up with a new one that is\r\ncharacterized by equality, mutual trust, mutual benefit,\r\ncooperation and settlement of disputes through\r\ndialogue.\r\nIn recent years, China, Russia, Kazakhstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have reached, within the\r\nframework of the Shanghai Five and through\r\nconsultation and cooperation based on equality, an\r\nagreement among themselves on confidence-building\r\nin the military field and reduction of military forces in\r\nthe border areas. This offers something useful for the\r\ninternational community to draw upon in its\r\nexploratory efforts for a new security concept.\r\nWe have noted with pleasure the positive changes\r\nin the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the\r\npositive outcome of the successful historic summit\r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nand the Republic of Korea. It has shown once again\r\nthat dialogue and consultation based on equality serve\r\nto enhance mutual trust and improve relations between\r\nStates. We appreciate the efforts made by both the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the\r\nRepublic of Korea to promote peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment on the peninsula and in the region.\r\nWe deeply regret that the tripartite summit at\r\nCamp David failed to produce any agreement. We\r\nbelieve that the Middle East peace process will move\r\nforward as long as the parties concerned earnestly,\r\npatiently and unswervingly engage themselves in\r\nnegotiating and seriously implement the agreements\r\nthat have already be reached among them on the basis\r\nof the relevant United Nation resolutions, in\r\naccordance with the principle of land for peace and in\r\nthe spirit of mutual trust and mutual accommodation.\r\nIn the twentieth century, mankind suffered a great\r\ndeal from the scourges of war. In the twenty-first\r\ncentury, humanitarian crises of a massive scale must be\r\nprevented, and the tragedy of innocent people being\r\nslaughtered on a large scale must not be allowed to\r\nrepeat itself. The United Nations shoulders a primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of world peace, and\r\ntherefore it should work harder to stop conflicts and\r\neliminate wars.\r\nIn the present-day world, hegemony and power\r\npolitics still exist. Territorial disputes, ethnic feuds and\r\nreligious rifts have all led to incessant regional\r\nconflicts. Some countries and regions hope that the\r\nUnited Nations will assist them in stopping conflicts,\r\nwhich we fully understand. At the same time, we must\r\nnot fail to see the complexity of international\r\nintervention and the danger of inappropriate\r\nintervention. The United Nations intervention should\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\naim at eliminating the root causes of a given conflict\r\nrather than delaying its settlement. It should aim at\r\nfacilitating reconciliation between the conflicting\r\nparties rather than deepening their hatred and hostility.\r\nWe are of the view that major powers and groups of\r\ncountries should respect the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of the countries concerned rather than\r\nmeddling in their internal affairs or triggering new\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn the new circumstances, peacekeeping\r\noperations remain an important means for the United\r\nNations to fulfil its obligations in safeguarding world\r\npeace and security. In this regard, it is essential to\r\nensure and enhance the Security Council’s\r\nresponsibility and political leadership in peacekeeping\r\noperations and to ensure the observance of the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations should be\r\nlaunched with a sense of realism and within the\r\ncapacities of the United Nations. The limited resources\r\nshould be put to where they are most needed.\r\nHuman beings are the most precious among all\r\nthe creatures on earth. To promote human development\r\nand protect all the rights and interests of mankind is the\r\nprimary responsibility of all countries. China is the\r\nmost populous country in the world. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has taken upon itself to safeguard the\r\nindependence and dignity of the Chinese nation and to\r\nensure the almost 1.3 billion Chinese the right to a\r\ndecent life and all-round development. It has regarded\r\nthis as its sacred duty and will do all it can to achieve\r\nthis end.\r\nHuman rights improvement is an ongoing\r\nprocess. The human rights conditions of a country are\r\nup to the people of that country to assess and improve.\r\nSince people live under different circumstances, the\r\nform in which human rights are embodied changes with\r\nthese circumstances and with time. Therefore, how to\r\nprotect and promote human rights depends on the\r\nactual conditions and specific needs of a country. To\r\narbitrarily impose a fixed set of human rights rules,\r\nregardless of the differences in the specific\r\nenvironment and reality, will not serve the interests of\r\nthe people of any country. To interfere in other\r\ncountries’ internal affairs in the name of protecting\r\nhuman rights in order to advance one’s own political\r\nagenda is simply to blaspheme and betray the human\r\nrights cause.\r\nThe United Nations should vigorously encourage\r\ndialogues and exchanges among different civilizations\r\nand countries on human rights and discourage\r\nconfrontation and exclusion — which are the general\r\ntrend of the human rights movement. In providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance, the United Nations should\r\ngive equal priority to the prevention of conflicts and\r\nthe protection of human rights, on the one hand, and to\r\nthe reduction and elimination of poverty and the\r\npromotion of human development, on the other hand.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations should work in\r\nclose coordination and cooperation with the countries\r\nand Governments concerned, instead of bypassing\r\nthem, and ensure human rights for the majority of the\r\npeople. Otherwise, such operations will trigger a\r\nhumanitarian disaster of a greater scale. Only when the\r\nabove-mentioned principles are abided by can the\r\nUnited Nations play a useful role in protecting human\r\nrights.\r\nA few days ago, from this solemn podium\r\nChinese President Jiang Zemin proclaimed to the\r\nwhole world the Chinese people’s firm determination\r\nto turn China into a strong, prosperous and united\r\ncountry with a high degree of democracy, and to\r\npromote world peace and development. In the past 20\r\nyears and more since the inception of reform and\r\nopening-up, China completed the first and second\r\nphases of its modernization strategy. With the advent of\r\nthe new century, China will begin the third phase of the\r\nstrategy and enter a new stage of accelerated\r\nmodernization. Once China becomes a member of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), there will be major\r\nbreakthroughs in its opening-up. China will honour its\r\ncommitments and seriously fulfil its obligations, while\r\nenjoying its rights.\r\nAlthough there will be difficulties, risks and\r\nchallenges on the road ahead, China is capable of\r\nremoving every obstacle and achieving its grand\r\nobjective of modernization. China will unswervingly\r\nstick to its independent foreign policy of peace and\r\nfurther develop its friendly relations with the rest of the\r\nworld on the basis of the five principles of peaceful\r\ncoexistence. A strong and developed China will not\r\nonly benefit more than a billion Chinese people but\r\nalso serve prosperity and progress worldwide.\r\nTo resolve the question of Taiwan once and for all\r\nand complete the reunification of the motherland is a\r\nshared aspiration of the entire Chinese people,\r\nincluding our Taiwan compatriots. Adherence to the\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nprinciple of peaceful reunification and one country, two\r\nsystems in resolving the Taiwan question will serve the\r\ndevelopment of the two sides on either side of the\r\nstraits, contribute to amity and unity among\r\ncompatriots on both sides, and facilitate peace and\r\nstability in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese\r\nGovernment and people have committed themselves\r\nmore strongly than anyone else to a peaceful\r\nreunification. They have demonstrated the utmost\r\nsincerity and made the greatest efforts to this end. We\r\nare convinced that — with the concerted efforts of the\r\nentire Chinese people, including those living in\r\nTaiwan — China will be able to realize its complete\r\nreunification at an earlier date.\r\nWe are entrusted with the important task of\r\ncharting a course for mankind for the coming century.\r\nLet us join hands and work together to build a more\r\nsecure, prosperous and progressive world in the new\r\ncentury.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Lamberto Dini.\r\nMr. Dini (Italy): I wish to congratulate the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Namibia, Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, on his wise leadership of the fifty-fourth\r\nGeneral Assembly and his able preparation of the\r\nMillennium Summit. I would also like to offer the\r\nincoming President, Harri Holkeri, my best wishes\r\nupon your assumption of this high office. Your\r\ncommitment and experience will be invaluable in\r\nensuring the success of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nItaly fully supports the statement made on behalf\r\nof the European Union by the current President, French\r\nForeign Minister Hubert Védrine, and will make a\r\ndecided contribution to the objectives he has indicated.\r\nAllow me to add that it is also in order to step up our\r\ncommitment to achieving common goals that Italy is\r\npresenting its candidature for the Security Council for\r\nthe next biennium.\r\nThe year 2001 will be the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations. By unanimously\r\nadopting the relevant resolution in its fifty-third\r\nsession, the General Assembly demonstrated its great\r\nsensitivity and attention to the profound structural\r\nchanges under way in our national societies. It thereby\r\nsent a strong signal on a number of themes that the\r\nSecretary-General has put forth in his report on the role\r\nof the Organization in the twenty-first century. These\r\nthemes cannot fail to include the new face of\r\ninternational migration, whose gravest aspects include\r\nillegal immigration and the trampling of human\r\ndignity.\r\nDialogue among civilizations should not be\r\naddressed in the abstract, academically. It demands real\r\ncontact and a bond between individuals and peoples.\r\nTo ensure that these contacts and this bond do not\r\nmutate into tensions and strife, the community of\r\nStates must try to understand and manage migratory\r\nphenomena. We must work together to prevent\r\nmigration flows from plunging into chaos, a chaos for\r\nwhich the human person ultimately has to pay the\r\nhighest price.\r\nMigration needs to be governed by fixed,\r\ntransparent rules. The source, the rationale of these\r\nrules is the United Nations, to which the San Francisco\r\nCharter in Article I, paragraph 3, entrusts the\r\nfundamental role:\r\n“To achieve international cooperation in solving\r\ninternational problems of an economic, social,\r\ncultural, or humanitarian character.”\r\nI submit to you that today migration between or\r\nwithin continents has become an international problem\r\nwith an economic, social, cultural and humanitarian\r\ncharacter.\r\nAny solution to the problems connected with\r\nmigration must come to terms with the globalization\r\nprocess. Globalization has reduced distance and time.\r\nTo an unprecedented degree it has linked countries at\r\nopposite ends of the earth. There are even those who\r\nspeak, perhaps not wrongly, of “the end of geography”.\r\nThe paradox facing us stems from the real\r\ndifficulties of globalization extending not only to the\r\neconomy, finance and information but also to the\r\nmovements of peoples. Most of these difficulties can\r\nbe ascribed to the complex transition of many advanced\r\ncountries to multi-ethnic and multicultural societies.\r\nHuman beings are not commodities. When\r\nindividuals move, they preserve their roots, their\r\nspecificity and their experience, even when they come\r\ninto permanent contact with societies different from\r\ntheir own. Hence the need for mutual tolerance, to\r\nsafeguard our respective customs and traditions.\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nThe growing dimensions of migration have\r\nwidened the gap between individual government’s\r\nmanagement capabilities and the individual person’s\r\nability to move, which is heavily influenced by\r\nprogress in communications. All too often this gap is\r\nfilled by organized crime, by ruthless criminals who, in\r\nsome cases, traffic in human beings, in what amounts\r\nto a modern form of slavery.\r\nWe need to ask how we can safeguard freedom\r\nwhile impeding slavery; how we can prevent global\r\neconomic development from sparking social tensions;\r\nhow we can ensure that the growing contact between\r\ndifferent civilizations will produce dialogue rather than\r\nintolerance. It will take a strong, determined\r\ncommitment from all of us to draft rules that, if\r\napplied, can have a positive impact on international\r\nmigration flows, to the benefit of both home and host\r\ncountries.\r\nImproving millions of human lives is the\r\nfundamental challenge of development: we need a\r\nclear, explicit and effective commitment to eradicate\r\npoverty. We must realize that in a globalized world,\r\nmigration can gradually impoverish areas that are\r\nalready economically and socially disadvantaged.\r\nDevelopment assistance initiatives from\r\nindustrialized countries and non-governmental\r\norganizations alike cannot defeat misery and poverty,\r\nunless they are accompanied by an awareness that\r\nforeign debt is a huge burden for Governments,\r\nfamilies and individuals. Generous remission of the\r\npoorest countries’ debt is not just an option: I feel it is\r\na must. This is why the Italian Parliament recently\r\napproved a law to reduce foreign debt owed to Italy by\r\na total of $6 billion over the next three years.\r\nItaly will also play a pro-active role in urging the\r\nleading actors in the field of development assistance to\r\nshow determination in preparing the conference on\r\nless-developed countries scheduled to take place in\r\nBrussels next May. Moreover, my country confirms its\r\nsupport for the needs and aspirations of the small-\r\nisland States and the landlocked countries, as it has\r\nemphasized in the Economic and Social Council and\r\nother forums.\r\nBut debt reduction is not enough. It should be\r\ncoupled with sound government policies in the\r\nbeneficiary countries, as part of an integrated strategy\r\nunderlying a new international social contract. In other\r\nwords, we must promote a package that combines\r\nresponsible political, economic and social reforms with\r\nan opening-up of international markets. The 2001 high-\r\nlevel intergovernmental meeting on financing for\r\ndevelopment will provide us with a close opportunity\r\nto finalize a strategy.\r\nThe fears that immigration sometimes generates\r\nshould not lead industrialized countries to build new\r\nwalls and fences. Such fears reject contact with\r\ndiversity and make some feel as if they were strangers\r\nin their own country. A Europe built on fear, for\r\nexample, would ultimately cast immigrants as the\r\nimaginary enemy, as a race apart. Any effort to\r\novercome such negative stereotyping should be\r\napplauded, such as the Conference against Racism,\r\nscheduled for 2001 in Pretoria.\r\nThe European Union has a great capacity to take\r\nin people, and already has large immigrant\r\ncommunities. But only now is it developing a common\r\napproach to immigration. The European Union’s\r\nstrategy relies on cooperation with other countries,\r\nsince the issue cannot be addressed solely through\r\nborder patrols and tougher repression of illegal\r\nimmigration, regardless of the cost.\r\nFor many years Europe did not have to worry\r\nabout the long-term consequences of immigration. But\r\ntoday, with a declining birth rate and an ageing\r\npopulation, Europe needs a strategy that embraces the\r\ncomplex process of integrating people from different\r\nregions of the world.\r\nThen, there is the tragic, heinous trafficking in\r\nhuman beings. As the United States Secretary of State\r\nMadeleine Albright stated in this Assembly, we must\r\nput a stop to this trafficking, a stop to boats being cast\r\ninto the sea, filled with sadness and desperation, driven\r\nby hopes in a promised land. The pictures of these\r\nillegal crossings have become unbearable. They\r\nepitomize a state of affairs governed by the black\r\nmarket, where there is an over-abundance of illegal\r\nlabour. This new form of piracy would be impossible if\r\nthose involved knew that they could not count on\r\ncollusion, safe havens and, all too often, impunity.\r\nFor example, the Mediterranean Sea, around\r\nwhich great civilizations have prospered, is being\r\ncrossed by people who pay ruthless exploiters and\r\nsometimes become their victims. In many cases, illegal\r\nimmigrants find it hard to gain access to the rule-of-\r\nlaw society, and end up being treated as commodities.\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nAs we know, immigration has various causes:\r\npoverty, ethnic and religious strife, the repression of\r\ntotalitarian regimes, and the demands of more affluent\r\neconomies. Today, as never before, immigration is\r\ndriven by broadcast images that often distort honest\r\nhopes for a better life. Moreover, it has reached\r\nunprecedented proportions. In fact, since the early\r\neighties the number of countries that receive\r\nimmigrants has risen from 39 to 67, while the number\r\nof countries of emigration has risen from 29 to 55. We\r\nwould be fooling ourselves to think that a phenomenon\r\nof such proportions could be brought under control\r\nsolely through bilateral agreements.\r\nThe European Union has made cooperation\r\nbetween national Governments a priority since the\r\nEuropean Council meeting of October 1999. But recent\r\nexperience points to the need for an approach in which\r\nonly the United Nations can confer the indispensable\r\ncharacter of universality.\r\nItaly has much to share in this regard. Until a few\r\ndecades ago, large sections of our population were\r\nforced to seek work in distant lands with different\r\nlanguages and traditions. Their lives were often marked\r\nby hardship, want and family separation. This chapter\r\nof social history had points of light and of darkness,\r\nbut on the whole it was a source of great moral and\r\nspiritual wealth.\r\nStarting in the early 1970s, Italy became a land of\r\nimmigration, although it could not yet provide full\r\nemployment for all its people. As a land of both\r\nemigration and immigration, Italy is well situated to\r\naddress in a constructive manner global migration\r\ntoday. Italian domestic law is based on the principle of\r\n“soft integration”, designed to provide permanent\r\nresidents with an opportunity that does not force them\r\nto renounce the rich heritage of their native cultures.\r\nIt is on these grounds that, here before the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I urge the United Nations to raise\r\nthe awareness of the community of States and\r\nintroduce appropriate instruments. Three instruments,\r\nin my view. deserve to be coordinated and integrated.\r\nFirst is assistance to the developing countries;\r\nassistance in preventing and quelling the tensions that,\r\nat least in part, give rise to migration flows, as well as\r\nassistance in easing the integration of their economies\r\nwith those of the more advanced countries. As we all\r\nknow, this is a priority that the United Nations is\r\npursuing through various committees and through the\r\nenhanced role of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme. We must strive to improve the instruments\r\nalready available to us, responding to the visionary\r\nproposals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\r\nSecondly, as a deterrent to illegal entry, we need\r\nstricter and more consistent law enforcement. Success\r\ndepends on effective cooperation between the countries\r\nof origin, the countries of transit and the countries of\r\narrival. Such efforts should also aim to prevent the\r\nspread of pockets of illegality and organized crime by\r\npromoting greater stability, moral authority and control\r\nin fledgling democracies. This would be invaluable to\r\nsecuring the support of public opinion in industrialized\r\ncountries for cooperation policies.\r\nThirdly, we need to manage migration so that it is\r\na source of stability and wealth, to the benefit of all.\r\nFor this to happen, migration must take place legally. If\r\neveryone complies with the law, immigrants will be\r\nwelcomed in their host countries and become fully\r\nintegrated into society.\r\nThese three guidelines must be set within a global\r\nframework. There are plenty of organizations that deal\r\nwith migration at the international level. Yet while they\r\nprovide praiseworthy services, their sectorial nature\r\nmeans that they cannot have the kind of overall vision\r\nthat only effective coordination can guarantee.\r\nA solidarity pact, therefore, is needed to find the\r\nbest and most effective way of balancing the supply of\r\nand demand for labour, while fully respecting the\r\ndiversity of the people concerned. The greatest\r\nchallenge in the age of globalization is to design new\r\nforms of cooperation between Governments that will\r\nenable each to see that its interests are reflected in\r\ninternational policy decisions. The United Nations\r\ncontinues to be the most natural forum for adopting\r\nsuch decisions and ensuring their implementation.\r\nI want to conclude my message today by recalling\r\nthe words of a great American President, John\r\nFitzgerald Kennedy. Almost 40 years ago he said,\r\n“Now the trumpet summons us again ... to\r\nbear the burden of a long twilight struggle ...\r\nagainst the common enemies of man: tyranny,\r\npoverty, disease and war itself.\r\n“Can we forge against these enemies a\r\ngrand and global alliance, North and South, East\r\nand West, that can ensure a more fruitful life for\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nall mankind? Will you join in that historic\r\neffort?” (Inaugural Address, 20 January 1961)\r\nThat is what he said, and this is the wish that I\r\nshould like to make here: that the United Nations,\r\nthrough its indispensable role, may strengthen its\r\ncontribution to creating a better and more just world\r\nwith the unflagging support of its membership.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the First\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the State of Kuwait, it gives\r\nme pleasure to extend to you, Mr. President, warm\r\ncongratulations on your unanimous election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. We wish you success in\r\nsteering the deliberations of this landmark session. Let\r\nme assure you of my delegation’s commitment to work\r\nconstructively with you towards meeting the common\r\ngoals and aspirations of the international community.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nthe remarkable efforts made and prudence shown by\r\nyour predecessor during his presidency of the last\r\nsession of the Assembly.\r\nIn the same vein, let me once again place on\r\nrecord our great admiration of and appreciation for the\r\ncrucial role played by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, since he assumed the helm at the United\r\nNations. Mr. Annan has been working tirelessly to\r\nimprove the performance of the Organization’s system\r\nin the interest of global peace, security and\r\ndevelopment and to bring it more in line with the\r\nongoing transformations in international relations.\r\nOn a membership note, let me now extend a\r\nwarm welcome to the Republic of Tuvalu, which has\r\njoined our ranks as the newest Member of the United\r\nNations. Tuvalu’s admission to membership enhances\r\nthe universal character of the Organization.\r\nJust a few days ago, United Nations Headquarters\r\nhosted an unprecedented, historic gathering of a very\r\nlarge number of heads of State or Government, who\r\ncome together to renew their commitments to the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and to reiterate their\r\nunwavering belief in the importance and relevance of\r\nthe United Nations in developing a better world,\r\nstructured on the values of justice, equality,\r\ncoexistence and cooperation.\r\nThe Millennium Summit was a momentous\r\noccasion to review and appraise the achievements and\r\nfailures of the past. It was an occasion to sketch out a\r\nvision to face the challenges of the future. The\r\nDeclaration adopted by the Summit, together with the\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe twenty-first century, are a blueprint for addressing\r\nthe pressing problems and challenges that will confront\r\nmankind in key areas. Chief among those daunting\r\nchallenges that hamper the fulfilment of peoples’\r\naspirations around the globe to achieve adequate levels\r\nof freedom, dignity and peace are the arms race,\r\nincreasing national and racial conflicts, poverty,\r\nignorance, development, human rights abuses,\r\nterrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of\r\nlethal infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria.\r\nThe list can indeed go on ad infinitum. The effects and\r\ndangers of those problems cut across national borders\r\nand transcend any artificial barriers. If anything, this\r\nfact confirms the need for consolidated international\r\nefforts and a reinforced United Nations role system-\r\nwide.\r\nHere, we note with some measure of satisfaction\r\nthe ongoing attempts being made at the global level to\r\ncope with those problems. Numerous world\r\nconferences and special sessions of the General\r\nAssembly held in the last few years have facilitated the\r\nconclusion of several international agreements and\r\ntreaties covering a range of subjects. In those meetings,\r\nit was reaffirmed that resolve would rid humanity of\r\nthe risks of nuclear weapons and the alarming dangers\r\nposed to international peace and security by their\r\nproliferation. In another important area, the Beijing\r\nDeclaration and the Platform for Action were\r\nentrenched to enhance the status of women and to\r\nensure their full rights. The Copenhagen Summit, with\r\nits focus on universal human development, was also the\r\nsubject of a follow-up conference held recently.\r\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait takes pride in\r\nthe fact that the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme’s Human Development Report 2000 states\r\nthat Kuwait has maintained its rank of first among\r\nArab countries, and number 36 in the world, in the\r\nfield of human development. Kuwait is now\r\ndetermined to pursue its efforts to do even better in the\r\nfuture. A key component of our efforts is our\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\ncommitment to the implementation of the principles\r\nand goals enshrined in the international conventions\r\nand treaties covering human development and human\r\nrights, and to employ them at the national level with a\r\nview to improving our economic and social conditions.\r\nInteraction between the Kuwaiti Government and the\r\nNational Assembly — which is the legislative authority\r\nin Kuwait and the product of robust parliamentary and\r\ndemocratic life in our country — will certainly\r\naccelerate our efforts to fulfil the goals and aspirations\r\nof the people of Kuwait.\r\nIn the course of the decades that span the life of\r\nthe United Nations, the Organization has established a\r\ngood record of achievement and has proven its\r\neffectiveness in the resolution of many disputes and\r\nconflicts. It has also helped to contain many problems.\r\nThus, it is now really difficult to imagine a world\r\nwithout the United Nations. The Millennium Summit\r\nDeclaration reaffirmed that the United Nations is the\r\ncommon house indispensable to the entire family of\r\nnations. Having said that, and in view of the profound\r\ntransformations in the world order and the attendant\r\nnew problems and challenges, it has become imperative\r\nto continue to support and cooperate with the\r\nSecretary-General to reform the United Nations bodies\r\nwith a view to streamlining them in response to the\r\nglobal changes, thereby enabling them to respond\r\nbetter to the challenges of the future.\r\nIn that regard, we reaffirm the need to pursue\r\nefforts to improve the procedures and working methods\r\nof the Security Council. The goal is to make the work\r\nof the Council more transparent and to increase the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent seats, with a\r\nview to expanding the base of the decision-making\r\nprocess under controls that ensure equitable\r\nrepresentation to making an efficient contribution to\r\nthe Council’s fulfilment of its functions and\r\nresponsibilities in terms of maintaining international\r\npeace and security.\r\nAt this juncture, we wish to underscore the need\r\nfor all Member States to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions in full and on time, both to the United\r\nNations regular budget and to the peacekeeping\r\noperations budget. It is indeed essential to provide\r\nadequate financial resources to the United Nations so\r\nthat it may carry out its mandates.\r\nTen years have elapsed since the Iraqi invasion of\r\nthe State of Kuwait. That invasion constituted a serious\r\nprecedent in international relations because it\r\nrepresented a flagrant violation of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the norms and principles of\r\ninternational law. Furthermore, that invasion\r\nundermined the security and stability of the Gulf\r\nregion. Kuwait now recalls with pride the firm stand\r\nand resolve demonstrated by the international\r\ncommunity in condemning, confronting and defeating\r\nthat aggression. All of that was distinctly illustrated in\r\na quick series of resolutions adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil under Chapter VII of the Charter as of the very\r\nfirst day of the invasion, on 2 August 1990. That\r\nhistoric stand by the international community was a\r\nremarkable embodiment and consolidation of the\r\nsystem of collective security. It also ushered in a new\r\ninternational order and represented a clear and strong\r\nmessage to any Government or regime that might\r\npursue a policy of aggression with a view to territorial\r\nexpansion at the expense of others.\r\nThe reverberations of the sinister Iraqi aggression\r\nare still being felt by all of us today. The Security\r\nCouncil remains seized with the repercussions of that\r\naggression. Since the invasion, the Council has had to\r\nadopt 54 resolutions and numerous presidential\r\nstatements in response to the persistent procrastination\r\nand equivocation of the Government of Iraq, which has\r\nconstantly sought to evade its international obligations.\r\nIndeed, it is regrettable that for 10 years now the\r\nGovernment of Iraq has failed to meet its obligations\r\nunder Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe main requirements yet to be met under the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council relate to the\r\nquestion of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and\r\nhostages. This humanitarian issue illustrates the\r\ntragedy facing hundreds of families who continue to\r\ngrieve over the unknown fate of their loved ones. Little\r\nprogress, if any, has been made. Basically, we are still\r\nat square one. Resolutions 686 (1991), 687 (1991) and\r\n1284 (1999), which requested Iraq to unconditionally\r\ncooperate with the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC) to account for prisoners and hostages,\r\nremain unimplemented. In fact, since its boycott of\r\nboth bodies in January 1999, the Government of Iraq\r\nhas continued to illustrate its disregard for the\r\nhumanitarian nature of this issue through its insistence\r\non not resuming its participation with the Tripartite\r\nCommission and its Technical Subcommittee.\r\nFurthermore, the Government of Iraq also insists on\r\nnon-cooperation with the high-level Coordinator,\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nAmbassador Yuli Vorontsov, who was appointed by the\r\nSecretary-General to facilitate the repatriation of\r\nprisoners and hostages.\r\nLet me seize this occasion to reiterate our call to\r\nthe Iraqi Government to deal positively with this\r\nmatter, given its humanitarian, religious and moral\r\ndimensions. This issue must be resolved in accordance\r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions. Along\r\nthe same lines, we demand that Iraq cooperate with the\r\nhigh-level Coordinator to complete the return of stolen\r\nproperty. This is also in accordance with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. The most important of\r\nthose assets include military hardware that has been\r\nincorporated into Iraq’s military system and the\r\nirreplaceable archives of the State of Kuwait, which\r\nwere deemed by the Security Council as the “State\r\nmemory” of our country. The stubborn resistance by\r\nIraq to return these assets and documents betrays the\r\nnon-peaceful intentions still harboured by the\r\nGovernment of Iraq towards Kuwait.\r\nWhat is deeply regrettable is that the Government\r\nof Iraq has not only failed to meet the obligations we\r\noutlined earlier, but that it has allegedly completed the\r\nelimination of its weapons of mass destruction while at\r\nthe same time not allowing  United Nations inspectors\r\nto verify those claims. Iraq also claims to have fulfilled\r\nall its obligations under the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. In its stance, Iraq stands isolated in the\r\nface of the United Nations, the international\r\ncommunity and the many regional organizations and\r\ngroupings that continue to call on Iraq to complete its\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions.\r\nIn his report on the work of the Organization this\r\nyear, the Secretary-General put it succinctly and\r\neloquently when he stated:\r\n“Iraq’s lack of compliance with various\r\nSecurity Council resolutions continues to be of\r\ngrave concern.” (A/55/1, para. 54)\r\nIn addition, the decision adopted by the last\r\nministerial meeting of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, last June\r\nconfirms beyond any doubt that there is indeed a single\r\nunified international and regional position on the need\r\nfor Iraq to comply with Security Council resolutions.\r\nThat decision demanded that the Government of Iraq,\r\namong other things, continue its efforts to complete the\r\nimplementation of its commitments under Security\r\nCouncil resolutions in the interest of peace, security\r\nand stability in the region. It also welcomed the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1284 (1999)\r\nand invited Iraq to cooperate with the United Nations\r\nMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission\r\n(UNMOVIC) under the chairmanship of Mr. Hans Blix\r\nto implement the provisions of resolution 1284 (1999).\r\nThat same decision further stressed that Iraq must\r\nexpressly and clearly admit that its invasion and\r\noccupation of the State of Kuwait was a breach of pan-\r\nArab, Islamic and international treaties and laws; a\r\nbreach of the Charter of the League of Arab States and\r\nthe Common Arab Defence Pact; the Charter of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference; and the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. The decision also\r\nrenewed the Organization of the Islamic Conference’s\r\ninvitation to Iraq to take the necessary steps to\r\ndemonstrate its peaceful intentions towards the State of\r\nKuwait and other neighbouring countries, both in\r\nwords and deeds.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we would like to know\r\nwhere Iraq stands now vis-à-vis those resolutions and\r\nthe sincere calls made upon it by regional and\r\ninternational organizations. We note with regret that\r\nthe Government of Iraq, for a good 10 years now, has\r\nnot drawn the right lessons. It continues to reveal its\r\nnon-peaceful intentions and policies of aggression\r\ntowards the State of Kuwait and neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nThe remarks made by the Iraqi President and the\r\nannouncements by several high-ranking Iraqi officials\r\nlast month, together with the unjust Iraqi\r\nmisinformation campaign against Kuwait and the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, are perhaps the most\r\ncompelling evidence that the Iraqi regime is still\r\ndetermined to pursue a course of aggression and feels\r\nno sense of remorse or contrition over its actions of 2\r\nAugust 1990. Therefore, Kuwait calls on the\r\ninternational community to maintain its pressure on the\r\nGovernment of Iraq, with a view to forcing it to\r\nimplement  all relevant Security Council resolutions\r\nand to abandon its aggressive attitude, which seriously\r\njeopardizes the security and stability of the State of\r\nKuwait and of other States in the region.\r\nKuwait, for its part, supports all efforts made by\r\nthe United Nations to alleviate the suffering of the\r\nbrotherly people of Iraq, with whom we fully\r\nsympathize. We therefore welcome the improvements\r\nintroduced occasionally by the Security Council\r\nsanctions Committee established by resolution 661\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\n(1990) into the operational methods of the\r\nhumanitarian programme, with a view to facilitating\r\nand expediting delivery of humanitarian materials to\r\nthe brotherly people of Iraq. We note with satisfaction\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General issued last week, in\r\nwhich he stated that the humanitarian programme had\r\nsucceeded in providing a great measure of assistance to\r\nmeet the urgent humanitarian needs of Iraq in all\r\nsectors, despite the many obstacles and difficulties that\r\nthe programme faces.\r\nAt the regional level, in keeping with Kuwait’s\r\nkeen interest in ensuring security and stability in the\r\nArabian Gulf region, and in view of the close relations\r\nbetween the sister State of the United Arab Emirates\r\nand the friendly State of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nwe support the position of the States of the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council (GCC) on the question of the\r\nthree Emirates islands. We hope that the efforts being\r\nmade by the ad hoc GCC Tripartite Ministerial\r\nCommittee will prove successful in creating a bilateral\r\nnegotiating mechanism to resolve the current dispute\r\nover the islands in accordance with the norms and\r\nprinciples of international law and good\r\nneighbourliness. If negotiations fail to bring about a\r\nsolution, then the dispute should be referred to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice to resolve it in a\r\nsatisfactory manner. This will help bolster the\r\nmechanisms of reconciliation among the States of the\r\nregion and expand the channels of mutual interests and\r\nconfidence-building.\r\nIn the same vein, we would like warmly to\r\nwelcome the maritime border demarcation agreement\r\nbetween Kuwait and its sister the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia. This accord reflects the depth of brotherly\r\nrelations between our two countries. It also represents a\r\nmodel of civilized cooperation in resolving border\r\ndisputes and problems. With that outcome, we look\r\nforward with interest to the forthcoming talks between\r\nKuwait and the friendly State of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran to complete the demarcation of maritime\r\nborders between the two countries.\r\nWe take this occasion to pay tribute to the\r\nwisdom shown by the leaders of the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia and Yemen, which resulted in the signing of an\r\nagreement on the demarcation of the border between\r\nthe two countries. This will no doubt consolidate the\r\nunderpinnings of security and stability in the region.\r\nIn the context of the relentless search for a just,\r\nlasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East,\r\nKuwait has been closely following the peace process\r\nsince its inception in Madrid in 1991. That process has\r\ntime and again experienced obstacles, risks and\r\ndeadlocks due to the unwillingness of the Israeli\r\nGovernment to carry out the accords concluded with\r\nthe Palestinian National Authority within the\r\nframework of the peace process. Israel has so far\r\ndemonstrated its non-commitment to, and non-\r\ncompliance with, the operational principles and\r\nframework of the peace process anchored chiefly in\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973), together with the principle of land for peace.\r\nIsraeli intransigence aborted the success of the\r\nrecent Camp David summit despite the immense and\r\ntireless efforts made by the United States\r\nAdministration. Here, Kuwait wishes to reiterate its\r\ncommitment to the Arab position of adherence to peace\r\nas a strategic option. We also reaffirm our belief that a\r\ncomprehensive and just peace will not be possible\r\nwithout the full restoration to the Palestinian people of\r\ntheir legitimate rights, including the right of return of\r\nthe Palestinian refugees, pursuant to paragraph 11 of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III), and the\r\nestablishment of their independent state on their\r\nnational territory, with Jerusalem as its capital. We also\r\ncall for the resumption of negotiations on the Syrian-\r\nIsraeli track, with a view to achieving full Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan to the\r\nborder line of 4 June 1967.\r\nAt this point, we wish to urge the active and\r\neffective facilitators in the peace process, especially\r\nthe United States of America, to redouble their efforts\r\nand to bring pressure to bear on the Israeli Government\r\nto convince it that the only viable path to easing its\r\nsecurity concerns is a return to the framework and\r\nprinciples established at the Madrid Conference, in\r\norder to achieve a genuine peace that secures the\r\nreinstitution of lawful Arab rights to their legitimate\r\nowners.\r\nStill in the context of the Middle East, we would\r\nlike to express to our brothers in Lebanon — the\r\nPresident of the Republic, the Government and the\r\npeople — our warm congratulations on the restoration\r\nof national sovereignty over their liberated land after\r\nmore than 20 years of Israeli occupation, which left in\r\nits wake vast destruction in the regions of southern\r\nLebanon and western Bekaa. As a contribution to the\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction of southern Lebanon\r\nand with a sense of responsibility emanating from the\r\nclose brotherly bonds between Kuwait and Lebanon,\r\nthe Government of Kuwait has made a cash grant of\r\n$20 million and has requested the Kuwait Fund for\r\nEconomic Development to finance projects for\r\nrebuilding infrastructure in villages of the South.\r\nKuwait will in the meantime continue its support for\r\nLebanese Government efforts to extend sovereignty\r\nover all its national territory to safeguard Lebanon’s\r\nterritorial integrity and independence.\r\nKuwait welcomes the positive developments at\r\nthe national reconciliation conference of Somali\r\nfactions that was held in Djibouti last month. We pay\r\ntribute to the sustained and sincere efforts made by the\r\nPresident of Djibouti, His Excellency Mr. Ismail Omar\r\nGuelleh. We hope that the remaining factions will join\r\nthe national reconciliation process in order to shore up\r\nthe unity and stability of Somalia, which, we hope, will\r\neventually bring that country back into the fold of\r\nArab, Islamic and international life. We take this\r\nopportunity to stress Kuwait’s support for the people of\r\nSomalia in their efforts to rebuild State institutions and\r\nto reconstruct the country as a whole.\r\nTurning to the rest of Africa, Kuwait is following\r\nwith deep sorrow the conflicts and civil wars that have\r\nlong afflicted a number of countries. These conflicts\r\nimperil the peace and stability of many nations and\r\ndeplete their potentials, capabilities and resources.\r\nEven though the problems of Africa have come to be a\r\nfocus of the global agenda, and even though the United\r\nNations system has embarked on in-depth discussion\r\nand analysis of the root causes of those problems, the\r\nproposed solutions remain blueprints awaiting\r\nimplementation. The net result is that the continent\r\ncontinues to be plagued by bitter conflicts and painful\r\npolitical instability, which aggravate already intractable\r\neconomic and social problems, foremost among them\r\nforeign debt, poverty, illiteracy and the spread of\r\ncontagious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria,\r\nwhich afflict millions of people and claim the lives of\r\nhundreds of thousands of innocent victims every year.\r\nIt is very sad indeed that many countries in Africa\r\nare suffering from these problems at a time when the\r\nmodern world has made enormous progress in all areas\r\nof human activity. We therefore urge the international\r\ncommunity to pursue its efforts more vigorously to\r\nhelp bring peace and security to African nations and to\r\nassist them in meeting their economic and social\r\ndevelopment goals. A vital role can be played by the\r\ninternational aid agencies and financial institutions,\r\nwhich we hope will redouble their outreach efforts to\r\novercome Africa’s daunting problems and challenges.\r\nKuwait believes that any such donor drive will not be\r\neffective unless and until African peoples and\r\nGovernments themselves shoulder their responsibilities\r\nand dedicate their full energies to lifting themselves up\r\nout of their current misery and onto the path of\r\nmainstream modern progress. Another key factor in\r\nthis process is the need to resolve disputes by peaceful\r\nmeans in order to create a climate of security and\r\nstability and to preserve sorely needed economic\r\nresources.\r\nThe world today is witnessing the emergence of\r\nseveral promising economic phenomena created by the\r\nimmense information and technology revolution that is\r\nsweeping the communication and trade sectors. Of\r\nparticular significance is the formation of numerous\r\ninternational and regional economic blocs that are\r\nseeking to remove customs restrictions and to liberate\r\ntrade among nations. In response, many developing\r\ncountries have made drastic changes in their economic\r\nand administrative structures in order to align\r\nthemselves with those transformations and to put\r\nthemselves in an advantageous position with respect to\r\neconomic globalization in the hope of achieving better\r\neconomic growth and progress.\r\nKuwait thinks that the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization, notwithstanding its merits, could have an\r\nadverse impact on the economies of developing\r\ncountries unless the very basis of North-South\r\neconomic relations is restructured in line with the\r\ntenets of mutual benefit, common interest, the need to\r\nnarrow the technology gap, and the removal of\r\nobstacles that impede the access of the products of\r\ndeveloping nations to the markets of the developed\r\nindustrialized countries in the interest of both groups.\r\nIn the meantime, developed countries should provide\r\nadequate economic assistance to developing nations to\r\nhelp them strengthen their infrastructures and build up\r\ntheir economies on a sound and solid foundation.\r\nIn this context, Kuwait has never shrunk from\r\ndoing its fair share to meet all its international and\r\nregional obligations towards the developing countries.\r\nOur assistance is channelled through international aid\r\nagencies and institutions as well as through the Kuwait\r\nFund for Economic Development. That fund has\r\nprovided loans and financial grants for many\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\ndevelopment projects and programmes in scores of\r\ndeveloping countries. More than 96 countries on all\r\ncontinents have benefited from these loans and grants.\r\nWithin its means, Kuwait will remain committed to\r\nhelping the development efforts of developing\r\ncountries, because of our belief that overall\r\ndevelopment and broader participation and cooperation\r\nare essential for ensuring security and stability for all\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nWe remain hopeful at the outset of a new century\r\nthat the nations of the world will close ranks to fulfil\r\nthe noble principles and purposes of the United Nations\r\nCharter. We also hope that the Millennium Declaration\r\nwill be translated into a tangible reality that fulfils the\r\naspirations and the vision of peoples yearning to live in\r\na climate of security, peace, freedom and justice, and in\r\na world where the enormous power of science and\r\ntechnology will be harnessed to serve human\r\ndevelopment in all spheres of life and to enrich human\r\ncivilization.\r\nLet us make partnership and cooperation to build\r\na better tomorrow for our children our guiding motto in\r\nthe new century. Let us pledge ourselves to bequeath to\r\nthe generations of the coming century the assurance\r\nthat we have kept our faith to them, and that we have\r\nsown for them the seeds of goodness that will yield a\r\nbetter life.\r\nThe President: I give the floor next to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Ralph Maraj.\r\nMr. Maraj (Trinidad and Tobago): I wish to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession. At the same time, I record my thanks and\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Namibia.\r\nWe are meeting just after the historic Millennium\r\nSummit, which brought together more than 150 leaders\r\nof the world. Clearly, there is not much left to say. On\r\nthe other hand, there is much to be done. Urgent action\r\nis needed; the time for implementation is now.\r\nNational action is needed more than ever in all\r\ncountries. The fact is that each nation has the primary\r\nresponsibility for dealing with its own problems. It is\r\nnot sufficient to make visionary statements and well-\r\nintentioned commitments. The will to bring about\r\nchange in our societies must be demonstrated in all\r\nnations. We should remember that we are the solution\r\nto our problems, and that if we are to be effective the\r\npartners of others, we must demonstrate a willingness\r\nto help ourselves.\r\nWe must eliminate poverty. It is an indictment\r\nagainst humanity that in the twenty-first century more\r\nthan a billion of the world’s people are mired in the\r\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. Each\r\ncountry must adopt those policies necessary to\r\nengender growth in their economies and to ensure that\r\nall their citizens have access to the opportunities that\r\nare being created. It now behooves the international\r\ncommunity to take concrete and positive action to\r\nbring to fruition the commitment made by heads of\r\nState or Government in the Millennium Declaration: to\r\nreduce poverty levels by the year 2015.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago has already taken action\r\nthrough an appropriate policy framework and other\r\nmeasures of reform. As a result, our economy\r\ncontinues to grow, and we are generating employment\r\nwhile keeping inflation low. We are making efforts to\r\nensure that all our citizens benefit from the country’s\r\nsuccesses, and we are making strides towards the\r\nelimination of poverty and are today ranked very\r\nfavourably in the United Nations Human Development\r\nIndex.\r\nEducation is the key. It is a powerful force for\r\nsocial change. It is a human right. It goes far beyond\r\nschooling. It assists in combating poverty, empowering\r\nwomen, promoting human rights and democracy and\r\npromoting international peace and security. According\r\nto the United Nations Children’s Fund report, “The\r\nState of the World’s Children 1999”, 130 million\r\nchildren in the developing world are denied the right to\r\nbasic education. Regrettably, almost two thirds of them\r\nare girls. This cannot continue. All children must have\r\naccess to all levels of education. This must be a\r\nnational objective in every country. United Nations\r\ndeclarations by themselves will not help.\r\nSince independence, Trinidad and Tobago has\r\nplaced considerable emphasis on education, which\r\ncontinues to rank among the largest items of\r\nGovernment expenditure. The laws of Trinidad and\r\nTobago provide that education is mandatory for all\r\nchildren between the ages of five to 12 years. Tuition is\r\nfree at public and Government-assisted schools. We\r\ncontinue to improve our system. Pre-school education\r\nhas developed rapidly in Trinidad and Tobago, and\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nspecial education is also being given greater attention.\r\nIn further recognition of the importance of education,\r\nthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago recently\r\nembarked on a programme which will ensure free\r\nsecondary education for every child of secondary\r\nschool age, and this took effect with the opening of the\r\nnew academic year 2000-2001.\r\nIf people are not healthy, they can neither find\r\nfulfilment nor contribute to their country’s\r\ndevelopment. The poor of the world need easier access\r\nto essential drugs and vaccines to reduce mortality and\r\ndisability. It has to be a travesty that only one per cent\r\nof the budget of global health research is directed to\r\ndiseases like pneumonia, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria, all of which are concerns of developing\r\ncountries. In Trinidad and Tobago, health care is given\r\nhigh priority. The health budget continues to be one of\r\nthe major areas of Government expenditure and,\r\nthrough a decentralized system of regional health\r\nauthorities, health care is made accessible and\r\naffordable to all. The Government is constantly\r\ninvesting in human resources and physical\r\ninfrastructure to meet the demands of the population.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago has reduced\r\nthe cost of medication for some chronic diseases, such\r\nas glaucoma, diabetes, asthma and arthritis. We are also\r\nensuring that equipment for our physically challenged\r\ncitizens is affordable. Every effort is being made to\r\nreduce the backlog of certain common surgical\r\nprocedures. Next year, a National Health Insurance\r\nPilot Project is expected to be instituted to cover every\r\ncitizen. Under the proposed system, the Government\r\nwill pay the contribution on behalf of those persons\r\nwho cannot afford to do so.\r\nThe ravages of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its\r\ndevastating socio-economic consequences constitute\r\nanother of the major health-related challenges for the\r\ninternational community in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe spread of the HIV/AIDS virus is of particular\r\nconcern to the Caribbean, the second most seriously\r\naffected region. The Government of Trinidad and\r\nTobago views this matter very seriously, and we have\r\nlong embarked on a programme of action designed to\r\ncombat this scourge. It is based on research and\r\neducation and building partnerships with the public and\r\nprivate sectors, as well as actors in civil society. We are\r\nalso convinced of the need for greater global\r\npartnership to develop an effective and more affordable\r\nvaccine against HIV/AIDS. The present HIV-related\r\ndrugs should be made less expensive. We support the\r\nconvening as well of a special session of the General\r\nAssembly to consider all aspects of this problem.\r\nOur planet continues to experience environmental\r\ndegradation. The problem will never be solved unless\r\nthere is international cooperation, especially on the part\r\nof industrialized countries, which are mainly\r\nresponsible for the emission of greenhouse gases. We\r\nin the smaller countries, especially small island\r\nnations, are the most severely threatened. But even in a\r\nsituation where we are victims, we do not absolve\r\nourselves from responsibility. Trinidad and Tobago is\r\nalready doing its part. We have established a Ministry\r\nof the Environment and an Environmental Management\r\nAuthority. We have recently enacted legislation to\r\nempower this Authority. We have operationalized an\r\nenvironmental policing system, and we are now in the\r\nprocess of establishing a Green Fund, through which\r\nthe industrialists in our country will contribute to\r\nfinancing programmes for protecting the environment.\r\nThe Government is working in close collaboration with\r\nthe international community on environmental issues\r\nand, in this regard, we are a State Party to all of the\r\nmajor Conventions concerning the environment.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is actively involved in the\r\ndevelopment of national legislation to give effect to\r\nthese international treaties.\r\nI must join my Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) colleagues in lamenting the blatant and\r\npersistent misuse of the Caribbean Sea as a trans-\r\nshipment route for hazardous wastes. This continues to\r\nbe a cause for major concern to the Governments of the\r\nregion. We are not comforted by the assurances of\r\ncompliance by those who use this route for economic\r\ngain. A single accident can threaten the very viability\r\nof our societies. Can the commercial benefit from using\r\nthis route override its potentially horrendous\r\nconsequences? Accidents can occur, and we again call\r\nfor a halt to these shipments.\r\nNo country can progress without democracy and\r\ngood governance, which create the environment for\r\nprogress and development, peace and security. All\r\ncitizens must be included in the mainstream of national\r\nactivity. All must be allowed to contribute. Every voice\r\nmust be heard; every view considered; and every\r\ncitizen must have access to the opportunities that their\r\nsocieties create. This should be the primary\r\nresponsibility of every Government in every country.\r\nGovernment must also be based on the rule of law.\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nEach nation, therefore, has the responsibility to\r\ndevelop effective judicial and legal systems to both\r\nprotect the rights of the individual and guard the nation\r\nagainst any usurpation of its democratic systems. We in\r\nTrinidad and Tobago are proud of our strong\r\ndemocratic traditions. Free and fair elections are held\r\npeacefully, regularly and on time. There is freedom of\r\nspeech and of political association and freedom of the\r\npress. Our democratic tradition is buttressed by a very\r\nactive civil society, involving strong trade unions,\r\ndynamic social and cultural groups and other non-\r\ngovernmental actors. We have an independent\r\njudiciary, and we have recently embarked on the\r\nmodernization of our laws and legal system to keep our\r\ncountry in step with modern trends.\r\nEach Government has the duty to ensure the\r\nsecurity of both its State and citizens. One of the\r\nserious threats to security is the escalation of the worst\r\nkinds of crimes within national borders in many\r\ncountries. This battle against the criminal element is\r\nfaced by all societies, on differing levels, but it is a\r\nbattle to which Governments must, of necessity,\r\nallocate adequate resources if they are to maintain\r\npeace and foster development. In many developing\r\ncountries, the rise in the level of violent crime is\r\ndirectly related to poverty and the deprivation suffered\r\nby individuals. This link between poverty and\r\ndevelopment on the one hand, and peace and security\r\non the other, should not be minimized. Like most\r\ncountries, Trinidad and Tobago is battling the\r\nphenomenon of crime. In addition to allocating\r\nincreased resources to our protective services, to\r\nprovide them with manpower, infrastructure and\r\nequipment to deal with crime, we are implementing\r\nsocial programmes to combat deviant behaviour,\r\nthrough the Ministries of Education, Culture, Social\r\nDevelopment, Youth and Sport.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago continues to face the\r\nchallenges of the illicit traffic in drugs. Due to our\r\ngeographic location, we are used as a convenient\r\ntranshipment point in the drug trade. We have taken all\r\nmeasures available to us on the national, regional and\r\ninternational fronts to combat this menace to our\r\nsociety. The Government has, in this regard,\r\nestablished an agency to coordinate the overall efforts\r\nagainst drug trafficking and has entered into regional\r\nand bilateral arrangements for cooperation in\r\ncombating this serious crime. Our strengthened legal\r\nframework has led to successes in the investigation and\r\nprosecution of crimes associated with drug trafficking.\r\nLegislative measures include the Dangerous Drugs Act,\r\nthe Drug Court Bill, the Drug Abuse Rehabilitation\r\nTribunal Bill and the Proceeds of Crime Bill.\r\nAt the international and regional levels,\r\ncooperative efforts include a number of bilateral\r\nextradition and mutual legal assistance agreements. In\r\nJuly, 2000, Trinidad and Tobago, along with six other\r\nGovernments, signed an agreement establishing a\r\nregional justice protection programme, which provides\r\na framework for regional cooperation in the protection\r\nof witnesses, jurors and legal and law enforcement\r\npersonnel. While we will continue to strengthen\r\nexisting measures and to expand the spheres of\r\ncooperation, we wish to reiterate that this is a problem\r\nwhich the international community cannot successfully\r\ntackle without the necessary commitment of all States\r\nconcerned.\r\nAnother growing threat, which is closely related\r\nto the menace of the drug trade, is the illicit trade in\r\nsmall arms. We therefore attach great significance to\r\nthe convening of the 2001 United Nations Conference\r\non the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\r\nin All Its Aspects, and we fully support the very\r\nimportant preparatory work which will precede the\r\nConference.\r\nThe disease of racism, racial discrimination and\r\nreligious intolerance continues to plague the world as\r\nwe enter twenty-first century. This is an intractable\r\ncultural problem that can be ameliorated only through\r\neducation and enlightenment. It is the expectation of\r\nmy delegation that the World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance, to be held in South Africa at the\r\nend of August 2001, will produce action-oriented\r\nrecommendations to eliminate this scourge. No effort\r\nshould be spared to rid human civilization of this ugly\r\naffliction.\r\nAs a pluralistic society, Trinidad and Tobago is\r\nproud of its record of harmony. In our country, as\r\nimmortalized in our national anthem, every creed and\r\nrace find an equal place. We have become well known\r\nas a rainbow society and at present we are seeking to\r\ncreate the institutions and the legal framework to even\r\nfurther deepen our world-renowned harmony.\r\nWhilst I have thus far emphasized the need for\r\nnational action, we are fully aware that cooperation at\r\nan international level is absolutely necessary if we are\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nto deal effectively with the problems of our planet. In\r\nthis global village, no country can survive on its own.\r\nToday’s reality is globalization, borderlessness and\r\nintegration at the international, regional and\r\nsubregional levels. The United Nations, therefore, like\r\nall other international actors, has a pivotal role to play.\r\nFor example, the international financial institutions\r\nmust become more sensitive to the development needs\r\nof countries and the world trading system must take\r\ninto account the special concerns of the disadvantaged\r\nand the vulnerable.\r\nAs we have already demonstrated, Trinidad and\r\nTobago is willing to be an active participant in the\r\nconcerted effort of the international community to\r\nachieve the goals we have set for ourselves. We have\r\nalways proven this since becoming a member of this\r\nbody. We have participated, we have cooperated and\r\nsometimes, as with the International Criminal Court,\r\nwe have led the way.\r\nWe wish to achieve a humane global civilization.\r\nWe wish to bequeath to the future a planet of prosperity\r\nand peace for all.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mohamed Benaissa, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco.\r\nMr. Benaissa (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nAllow me first of all to congratulate you very warmly,\r\nSir, on your assumption of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. The\r\nMoroccan delegation will spare no effort in giving you\r\nevery support to ensure the success of your work. I\r\nwould also like to thank your predecessor and to wish\r\nhim every success in his responsibilities.\r\nI also cannot fail to pay a very warm and special\r\ntribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has led\r\nthe Organization with such conviction, tenacity and\r\ncompetence. I take this opportunity to congratulate him\r\non his efforts to ensure the success of the Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\nI also wish to convey my congratulations to the\r\nState of Tuvalu, which recently joined membership of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nMultilateral relations have become the most\r\nrealistic approach to transnational problems in a world\r\nundergoing the process of globalization. It is quite\r\nclear that a collective response is more necessary now\r\nthan ever before in our approach to the serious\r\nproblems of today’s world. It is obvious that no country\r\nor group of countries can claim to be able to take sole\r\ncharge of the numerous problems of besetting the\r\ncomity of nations. When we consider nuclear\r\nproliferation, weapons of mass destruction, the\r\ndeterioration of the environment, endemic poverty,\r\norganized transnational crime, the drug problem and\r\nother such problems, we are compelled to recognize the\r\nscope of the strenuous efforts that will have to be made\r\nby the international community to deal effectively with\r\nthem.\r\nDespite the tremendous progress that has been\r\nmade in recent years in all sectors of human activity,\r\nand despite the potential benefits heralded by the\r\nglobalization of economies and technological\r\nbreakthroughs, half of the world’s population continues\r\nto live in a state of abject poverty. Morocco believes\r\nthat efforts to reduce poverty and to ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment require international action in order to\r\nintegrate the developing countries in the global\r\neconomy and new reforms, undertaken by the countries\r\nconcerned, to meet the essential needs of their peoples\r\nwith respect to health care, education and employment.\r\nSimilarly, trade barriers must be reduced for those\r\ngoods that are of particular benefit to the exports of the\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed\r\ncountries. Medium-income countries should be relieved\r\nof their debt burden so that they can devote the\r\nresources thus freed to investments in social and\r\neconomic infrastructures.\r\nIn this context, Morocco believes that the time\r\nhas come for international institutions, particularly the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization, to adopt a new approach to assisting the\r\ncountries of the South in their development efforts.\r\nThese institutions must adapt themselves to the new\r\ninternational context in order to redress the imbalances\r\nbetween the countries of the North and the South,\r\nwhich have grown considerably since the external-debt\r\ncrisis. The total statistical indices available and the\r\nlessons learned from the paradoxical trends that are\r\nintrinsic to the world economy reveal the need to seek\r\nnew sources for financing and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. That being so, Morocco places great\r\nhopes on the holding of a world conference in the year\r\n2001 on financing for development and hopes that at\r\nthat time bold initiatives will be taken in order to\r\nalleviate the intensity of poverty in the world.\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nMorocco is rooted profoundly in its Africanism\r\nand is therefore very much concerned about the\r\ngrowing number of hot spots in Africa and also the\r\nillicit traffic in small arms that feeds those conflicts. It\r\nis extremely regrettable that our continent holds the\r\nunhappy record for refugees throughout the world,\r\nvictims of wars, as well as for epidemics, for example\r\nAIDS, malaria and many others. Only a concerted\r\neffort on the part of the African countries, with the\r\nsupport of the international community, will be able to\r\nreverse the current trend. Africa, which has been torn\r\nby armed conflicts, presents the image of a continent\r\ndrifting aimlessly. Nevertheless, we Africans have\r\nalways been known for our wisdom and our natural gift\r\nfor negotiation and conciliation.\r\nWe would like here to make a pressing appeal to\r\nall those involved to renounce resorting to force as a\r\nmeans of solving disputes. Africa has wasted a great\r\ndeal of time in internal quarrels, thus passing up\r\nvaluable opportunities for developing and becoming an\r\nintegral part of the world economy. The financial and\r\nhuman resources the belligerent parties have wasted\r\nkilling each other could have been better utilized to\r\nserve social and economic development projects in\r\ntheir respective countries and could have helped them\r\nto overcome all the problems that they face. That is\r\nwhy we support all the initiatives that have been\r\nrecommended by the United Nations to set up a\r\nstrategy to prevent conflicts and to improve\r\nmechanisms for intervention in these cases. As always,\r\nMorocco supports all those initiatives that help to\r\nstrengthen peace and security in Africa. In this regard,\r\nMorocco has responded to the United Nations appeal to\r\nparticipate in the peace mission in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nThe marginalization of Africa is a serious\r\nobstacle to its integration in global development. Our\r\ncontinent receives only 2 per cent of international\r\ninvestments, whereas the population of our continent is\r\nin excess of 700 million. While it is true that\r\nresponsibility for development of the continent rests\r\nfirst and foremost on the shoulders of the Africans, it is\r\nequally true that the resources available to the Africans\r\ncannot meet the considerable needs of their populations\r\nin all fields.\r\nFor that reason, it is becoming more and more\r\nurgent to help Africa by displaying solidarity in order\r\nto ensure that it embarks on the road to progress,\r\nsecurity and peace, specifically by developing its\r\nhuman resources, and by educational policies that are\r\nadapted to the realities of the continent and are in\r\nharmony with the values of that continent and its\r\ncivilizations. We also have to consider the question of\r\nthe debt of African countries so that the treatment of\r\nthis problem can finally generate wealth rather than be\r\nan obstacle to development. The effort of African\r\ncountries should also be supported by opening the\r\nmarkets of the developed countries to their products\r\nand their exports.\r\nFor its part, Morocco intends to spare no effort to\r\nmake its contribution to improving the living\r\nconditions of African peoples — hence, the decision\r\nthat was announced by His Majesty King Mohammed\r\nVI at the African-European Summit in Cairo, a\r\ndecision to cancel the debt of the least-developed\r\nAfrican countries to the Kingdom of Morocco, and also\r\nto remove customs barriers to their exports. We hope\r\nthat other countries, particularly the rich and\r\nindustrialized ones, will make a similar gesture.\r\nMorocco believes that the peace that we all aspire\r\nto in the Middle East can only be brought about if\r\ninternational legal principles are respected, particularly\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973), the principles which emerged from the Madrid\r\nConference, particularly the principle of land for peace,\r\nas well as the commitments and the agreements that\r\nwere concluded between the parties concerned.\r\nPeace in this region to which Morocco is so\r\nattached can only take place when Israel withdraws\r\nfrom all occupied Palestinian territories and the Syrian\r\nGolan. The international community must assist the\r\nPalestinian people to recover its legitimate and\r\ninalienable rights, first and foremost its right to set up\r\nits own independent State on its territory with Al Qods\r\nAl-Sharif as its capital.\r\nMorocco, on the initiative of His late Majesty\r\nKing Hassan II, may God have mercy on his soul, and\r\nhis successor King Mohammed VI, will spare no effort\r\nto usher in the establishment of just and comprehensive\r\npeace in the Middle East.\r\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, as chairman of\r\nthe Al-Qods Committee, during the State visit to\r\nWashington in June 2000, made an appeal to the parties\r\nconcerned to start upon a fruitful dialogue between the\r\ncultures and civilizations and:\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\n“to all believers, people of the Book and in this\r\nfaith which have united the children of Abraham,\r\nto liberate this thrice holy city from hatred and\r\nresentment.”\r\nThese same principles were reiterated by the\r\nCommittee on Al-Qods during its most recent meeting,\r\nwhich was held on 28 August under the presidency of\r\nHis Majesty Mohammed VI. Morocco would like to\r\njoin its voice with all peace and justice-loving\r\ncountries so that the current efforts may be crowned\r\nwith success, which will make it possible for all\r\npeoples in the region to live in peace, stability and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Moroccan people share the joy of our\r\nbrothers, the people of Lebanon, as a result of the\r\nIsraeli withdrawal from its territory, and we will\r\ncontinue to give our unflagging support to the people\r\nof Syria to reassume total sovereignty over the Golan\r\nHeights, which is occupied by Israel.\r\nWe are also following with some disquiet the\r\nburdensome conditions imposed upon the Iraqi people\r\nby the embargo which has deprived people, particularly\r\nchildren, of food and medicine and many other needs\r\nas well. Morocco, for its part, feels anxious at the\r\ndeterioration of the food and health situation in Iraq.\r\nWe support all international efforts to lift sanctions\r\nagainst that fraternal country. We consider furthermore\r\nthat safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq is a fundamental prerequisite for\r\nstability in the region.\r\nMorocco welcomes the suspension of the air\r\nembargo imposed on Libya. We also hope that the total\r\nembargo will be finally lifted as soon as possible.\r\nMorocco, aware as it is of its responsibilities, is\r\nsparing no effort to make the Maghreb an area of peace\r\nand peaceful coexistence among all peoples in the\r\nregion. The partners in the Arab Mahgreb Union must\r\nget beyond their current economic problems and accept\r\nthe fact that the only way to develop the region and\r\nensure its security and stability is to build this Union,\r\nin which our peoples have placed great hopes,\r\nparticularly at this time when the requirements of\r\nglobalization make the establishment of regional\r\ngroups yet more important.\r\nAmong the challenges faced by the Mahgreb,\r\nthere is the so-called problem of the Western Sahara. I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity first and foremost to\r\nconfirm that the Kingdom of Morocco, which initiated\r\nthe referendum, has cooperated completely in its\r\nimplementation and has indeed made a number of\r\nsacrifices to allow the population of that region to\r\nreassert its will.\r\nWe have been very patiently following the efforts\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General to allow this\r\nprocess to reach a successful conclusion. We have\r\nsupported all the efforts that have been made, since we\r\nare convinced that, in the final analysis, the\r\nreferendum, while ensuring respect for self-\r\ndetermination, will eventually confirm the rights of our\r\ncountry to territorial integrity and its sovereignty over\r\nthe entire southern territory.\r\nAs everyone knows and as has been emphasized\r\nby the Secretary-General and by the Security Council\r\nin various reports, the referendum’s implementation —\r\nto which, in contrast to what some have claimed, we\r\nremain committed — has come up against a number of\r\nproblems that may, if not resolved, endanger and\r\ncompromise the entire process. What essentially needs\r\nto be done is to ensure, without any kind of partiality\r\nor leniency, that the entire Saharan population, as has\r\nalways been agreed, may express its wishes in\r\naccordance with the letter and spirit of the referendum\r\nplan.\r\nIf the referendum is to be democratic, free and\r\nequitable, it must be subject to a number of rules that\r\nno one can transgress by trying to accommodate one\r\nparticular party at the expense of the other.\r\nThe Secretary-General and his Special\r\nRepresentative are still actively involved in this task.\r\nWe will continue to give them our total cooperation so\r\nthat the various difficulties besetting the\r\nimplementation of this plan can be overcome.\r\nOur country has made its own contribution to the\r\nefforts by making a number of suggestions that should\r\nbe acted upon if we want to have a democratic,\r\nimpartial and equitable referendum. We would repeat\r\nthat, for our part, while we remain committed to the\r\ncontinuation of this process and respect the rules set up\r\nfor it, we will give our total support to any action that\r\nthe Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, Mr.\r\nJames Baker, undertake to resolve this dispute once\r\nand for all. As His Majesty King Mohammed VI stated\r\non 30 June 2000, any settlement must be carried out in\r\nthe context of the sovereignty, legality and unanimity\r\nof the Moroccans.\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nThis being said, Morocco would like to draw the\r\ninternational community’s attention to the situation of\r\nthe tens of thousands of refugees who have been\r\nforcefully displaced and who have been living under\r\ninhumane conditions, according to the reports of\r\ninternational humanitarian organizations, of diplomats\r\nwho have had access to the camps, and of the hundreds\r\nof escapees who have managed to return to the Sahara.\r\nThe international community can no longer tolerate the\r\nsuffering of these people because of delays and\r\nconsiderations they themselves are not responsible for.\r\nNo one can disregard the fact that the Kingdoms\r\nof Spain and Morocco are joined by the unbreakable\r\nties of their age-old history, their geographical and\r\ncultural closeness, and by their common destiny as part\r\nof the Euro-Mediterranean region. Because of our\r\ndesire to safeguard these excellent fraternal and\r\nneighbourly relations Morocco has constantly appealed\r\nto friendly Spain and to all political forces in Spain to\r\nfind a solution that will spare our children unnecessary\r\nsuffering from crises inherited from a painful past.\r\nSpain, which is a great friend and neighbour,\r\nmust understand that the occupation of the two\r\nMoroccan cities of Septa and Melilla and the\r\nneighbouring islands is not in accord either with\r\ninternational law nor with the sense of history. Based\r\non similar situations, we are convinced that it is\r\npossible to devise a settlement that will both safeguard\r\nthe sovereignty of Morocco and respect and protect the\r\neconomic, social and cultural interest of Spain in both\r\nof these cities.\r\nFor this reason, on a number of occasions the\r\nKingdom of Morocco has suggested — on the initiative\r\nof His late Majesty Hassan II, may God preserve his\r\nsoul — that a Moroccan-Spanish think tank be created\r\nin order to bring about a final resolution of the\r\nsituation regarding Septa and Melilla and the\r\nneighbouring islands.\r\nOur two countries are duty bound to spare our\r\npeoples and our region from all possible\r\nmisunderstanding and resentment. It is for this reason\r\nthat Morocco offers a hand of peace to Spain, inviting\r\nit to commit to a common dialogue so as to resolve\r\nonce and for all this territorial dispute inherited from\r\nthe remote past.\r\nMorocco, because of its geopolitical position,\r\nattaches particular importance to stability and to\r\nstrengthening cooperation in the Mediterranean basin.\r\nRelations between Morocco and the European\r\ncountries is of great strategic importance in view of the\r\nvarious historic, political, economic, cultural and\r\nhuman ties that unite us and in view of the values we\r\nshare. The mutual attraction between Morocco and\r\nEurope derives from history, geography and common\r\nstrategic needs, while a range of mutual interests have\r\nnaturally made the European Community Morocco’s\r\nfirst partner in a number of areas relating to\r\ninternational cooperation. Relations with the European\r\nUnion have developed quite significantly this year with\r\nthe coming into force of the Association Agreement of\r\n1 March. This agreement marks a decisive stage in our\r\nrelations with the European region since it is built\r\nessentially on four fundamental pillars: political\r\ndialogue; economic, cultural, technical and social\r\ncooperation; enhanced financial cooperation; and the\r\nprogressive and responsible development of a free-\r\ntrade zone by the year 2012.\r\nMorocco is currently waiting for the European\r\nUnion to carry out the qualitative leap that will make it\r\npossible to redirect our association along new strategic\r\nand innovative lines — governed by agreed modalities,\r\nby shared responsibilities and by co-development in all\r\nsectors of common interest.\r\nIt is our hope that the flow of direct investments\r\ninto Morocco and to the other countries of North Africa\r\nas well will be encouraged in order to help create mass\r\nemployment, which is so essential to keep our youth\r\naway from social evils and to consolidate the bases of\r\nour progress in regional stability.\r\nIt is also our hope that the cultural interests and\r\nthe cultural identity of our Moroccan community in\r\nEurope will be safeguarded and that the dignity of our\r\nnationals will be constantly protected in accordance\r\nwith the democratic values that are the underpinning of\r\nthe European structure. In this context we can,\r\ntogether, conceive of a Mediterranean region where\r\nsecurity and peace prevail as well as a strengthened\r\nEuropean/Mediterranean partnership.\r\nIn disarmament matters, Morocco appreciates the\r\nconsiderable advances made by the Review Conference\r\nof the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),\r\nwhich took place in New York in May of this year.\r\nWe hope that Israel will respond positively to the\r\nConference’s appeal to accede immediately to the NPT\r\nand place its nuclear installations under the safeguards\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency. We are\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nconvinced that such a decision on the part of the Israeli\r\nauthorities will be a major contribution to ushering in a\r\nclimate of peace, trust and stability in the region.\r\nMorocco supports the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to organize an international conference that\r\nwould make it possible to find appropriate means to put\r\nan end to the nuclear threat.\r\nIt is Morocco’s firm conviction that the United\r\nNations continues to be the most appropriate tool and\r\ninstrument for settling conflicts and for building peace.\r\nIt is therefore high time that the Organization set up\r\ncredible machinery and early warning mechanisms to\r\nreact in an appropriate way before conflicts break out\r\nas recommended in the report of the high-level expert\r\nPanel on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.\r\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies\r\nare now more necessary than ever to contain and\r\nresolve the problems of security and development.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to be the\r\ncornerstone of strong multilateral cooperation.\r\nThe complexity and interdependence of the\r\nproblems before us mean that we must increase\r\ninternational cooperation and consultation. For that\r\nreason, a new era in international relations necessitates\r\na reform of the Security Council by revising its\r\nfunctions and its membership. Such a reform will\r\nundoubtedly confer greater credibility on the Security\r\nCouncil and make it better adapted to perform its\r\nmandate in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. Despite difficulties, the main point is to\r\nensure the best possible representation in the Security\r\nCouncil of the various current components of the\r\nUnited, particularly the developing countries.\r\nThe end of the ideological rivalry between the\r\ntwo super Powers means that we can entertain new\r\nprospects that there will emerge an international order\r\nbased on justice, peace, international legality and\r\nhuman rights as well as democracy and development,\r\nan order that will make use of the Charter as a work of\r\nreference and that will take into account the growing\r\nuniversalization of the Organization and the fact that\r\nnew global social challenges are emerging and also that\r\nrecent socio-strategic changes have occurred.\r\nFinally, we are convinced that if the United\r\nNations directs its actions along these lines, it will\r\nfinally meet the ideals for which it was founded.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Fernando De Trazegnies Granda.\r\nMr. De Trazegnies Granda (Peru) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the outset, I would like to join those who\r\npreceded me in congratulating you on your\r\nappointment as President of this last General Assembly\r\nof the twentieth century. Peru is pleased that a\r\nrepresentative of Finland, a country everyone knows is\r\ncommitted to the objectives of the Organization, is\r\nsteering the work of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI am convinced that, under your leadership we\r\nwill achieve the mandates that are necessary to begin to\r\npursue the vision developed by our Heads of State and\r\nGovernment at the recent Millennium Summit.\r\nI should also like to welcome and congratulate\r\nTuvalu for its incorporation into the United Nations.\r\nThis will undoubtedly represent an important\r\ncontribution to the different spheres of work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Millennium Summit has revealed the\r\nenormous challenges that lie ahead and the\r\noverwhelming need to forge a new form of\r\ninternational order that will allow future generations to\r\nenjoy a world free from the threats of war, poverty,\r\ninjustice and environmental deterioration and, at the\r\nsame time, one built on freedom with the participation\r\nof each of the great cultures that are part of mankind,\r\nwithout preference or prejudice.\r\nIt is extremely important that when we are about\r\nto conclude not just a century but also a millennium on\r\n31 December, we stop for a moment along the way to\r\nreflect on the future of international relations. Peru is\r\ncertainly not a decisive country in the development of\r\nglobal relations. Nevertheless it would seem that one of\r\nthe characteristics that appear at the end of the\r\ntwentieth century and that will certainly be emphasized\r\nin the twenty-first century is the basic role that all\r\ncountries of the world, whether large or small, have to\r\nplay in shaping the international order. And, in this\r\nsense, the perspective of a country, such as Peru that\r\nfully shares Western civilization and yet at the same\r\nhas its own characteristics that are the legacy of ancient\r\ntimes, may be of interest in carrying out the healthy\r\nexercise of approaching the subject from a different\r\nangles.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nPeru emphatically reiterates that the global order\r\nthat must shape the conduct of the different\r\ninternational actors within the century beginning on l\r\nJanuary, must be based on the essential principles of\r\nthe Charter which, contrary to certain beliefs that we\r\nbelieve to be mistaken, have not only not lost\r\nrelevance, but are increasingly important for peaceful\r\ncoexistence, collective security and also for a real\r\npossibility for the development of all the specific\r\ngroups that form part of the abstract element that we\r\ncall mankind.\r\nMay I emphasize, in particular, the rights that\r\nrefer to the sovereignty of States, to non-intervention in\r\ntheir domestic affairs and to the legal equality between\r\nStates. These basic principles, which were incorporated\r\nin the Charter in San Francisco, have allowed the\r\ndevelopment of effective mechanisms of self-control\r\nand the stabilization of the international system.\r\nThat is why we must renew our commitment to\r\nthese rules of international public law, restoring the\r\nfunctionality that is theirs. Only thus can we ensure\r\nthat the democratic values that prevail in contemporary\r\nsociety will apply and be enforced within an\r\ninternational system whose emerging features appear to\r\nseek new forms of exclusion.\r\nThe world today is not the same as the world of\r\n50 years ago. Change and globalization are constantly\r\nreshaping reality at a rapid rate and are attempting to\r\nimpose upon us a new sense of commonality, new\r\nmorals and a new political ethic that dogmatically and\r\nin a partisan manner define what is proper and\r\nimproper.\r\nFull respect for the international legal order\r\ntherefore acquires enormous significance since it is the\r\nonly element that can illuminate the common path,\r\nreducing arbitrariness and subjectivity. This is also the\r\nbest way and the most effective mechanism for the full\r\nprotection of human rights and human freedom, which\r\nare undoubtedly requirements that no member of the\r\ninternational community may evade.\r\nBut this new reality also imposes on us a need for\r\ncommitment to the principle of shared responsibility.\r\nThe profound interdependence posed by globalization\r\nalso assumes a collective determination by all the\r\nmembers of the United Nations community to combine\r\ntheir efforts and resources for the resolution of\r\nproblems that have systemic effects or effects of an\r\ninternational nature. I refer in particular to the\r\nachievement of lasting economic growth within the\r\ndeveloping countries; poverty elimination; confronting\r\nthe real threats to peace of an international scope;\r\npublic health problems and endemic illnesses that are\r\nmainly linked to poverty; finding sufficient financing\r\nfor development; the digital divide; migration and the\r\nfree movement of labour; environmental protection and\r\nconservation; the world drug problem, beyond a purely\r\nmilitary perspective; the scourge of terrorism and the\r\nvarious forms of international crime, including money\r\nlaundering, arms trafficking and international\r\ntrafficking in people.\r\nIt is highly important for Peru that each of these\r\ncommon problems be tackled within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations and that common, coherent and\r\ncomprehensive answers be found. We must be capable\r\nof finding effective solutions with sufficient political\r\nand financial support. In this context, let me express\r\nour particular satisfaction over the commitments made\r\nby the heads of State and Government to focus the\r\ninternational community’s attention in the coming\r\nyears on poverty reduction, so that by the year 2015\r\nnearly 600 million people will have overcome their\r\nstate of chronic poverty.\r\nSimilarly, I wish to emphasize the imaginative\r\nand constructive proposal presented by the President of\r\nPeru, Mr. Alberto Fujimori, at the Millennium Summit,\r\nto use the money illegally earned by captured drug\r\ntraffickers to alleviate the foreign debt of the poorest\r\ncountries and, in general, to utilize those funds to\r\ncontribute to the fight against poverty in the world.\r\nThere are undoubtedly many and very difficult\r\nchallenges that we must face during the next century.\r\nThis is the time of wealth and technological\r\ndevelopment, but also the time of struggle against\r\npoverty. This is the time of globalization, but also the\r\ntime of the respectful recognition of cultural diversity,\r\nwhich is an asset as important as, or more important\r\nthan, biological diversity. This is the time of the\r\ngreatest use of natural resources by man, but also the\r\ntime of environmental conservation. This is the time of\r\nthe universal spread of democracy, but also the time of\r\ndemocratic respect for the different ways in which\r\ndemocracy is lived.\r\nMankind has reached some basic consensuses at\r\nthis stage of its development. All the peoples of the\r\nworld share certain values and certain goals, such as\r\nfreedom, democracy, equality before the law, respect\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nfor human rights, the need to eliminate poverty, the\r\ndevelopment of creativity and the need for man to\r\nalways surpass itself. This has been the contribution of\r\nmodernity, the contribution of the latest centuries\r\nconsolidated in the twentieth century. But it is also true\r\nthat humanity is not made up, fortunately, of a single\r\nculture. It is also true that these values should find\r\nconcrete forms of their realization through different\r\nmentalities, in different latitudes, at different periods in\r\nthe history of each people. That is why post-modernity,\r\nthat world of the next century, must know how to\r\nconserve and deepen the values that are the legacy of\r\nmodernity and carry forward its goals as much as\r\npossible. But it must also acknowledge diversity; it\r\nmust know how to resolve dynamically the dilemma\r\nbetween unity and multiplicity.\r\nPerhaps the most complex of all these challenges,\r\nthe most difficult of all the coincidentiae oppositorum\r\nthat the twenty-first century will demand is to build an\r\ninternational system based on a genuine democracy.\r\nAnd by this I mean a democracy that does not consist\r\nof imposing a political form in the image of and similar\r\nto a specific system that is promoted as a model, a\r\ndemocracy that is not built on the basis of a mere\r\ncheck-list of institutions that have been taken from a\r\nspecific democratic experience and turned into\r\nmandatory universal guidelines. Democracy is the\r\npractice of diversity and tolerance. It is a recognition\r\nthat with regard to each subject, including the idea of\r\ndemocracy itself, there can be different interpretations,\r\nand none of them is entitled to ban the others. The task\r\nthat awaits us, then, during the next century is to\r\nspread and promote democracy but, above all, to\r\nfurther examine its own meaning to avoid\r\ncontradictions which would lead to its destruction.\r\nHow can we spread democracy without\r\nendangering democracy itself? On the other hand, how\r\ndo we save diversity and particularity without ending\r\nup with outdated nationalism? These are the major\r\nproblems of our time. They are the major dilemmas\r\nthat will have to be resolved in the twenty-first century.\r\nAny idea of a crusade, even in the name of\r\ndemocracy, is undemocratic, because it is intolerant.\r\nAnd I would almost dare to say that any principle of\r\nsocial organization that seeks to impose itself\r\nuniversally has an undemocratic base. Thus,\r\nparadoxically, the missionary enthusiasm for\r\ndemocracy ends up affecting the nature of democracy\r\nitself.\r\nDemocracy, in fact, implies a delicate and fragile\r\nbalance between the universal and the singular.\r\nSingularity should not be sacrificed on the deified altar\r\nof universality. Singularity should not be dissolved\r\nwithin a claimed universality, and the singular should\r\neven less be confused with the universal, assigning an\r\nabsolute value to what is no more than the historic\r\nexpression of a culture and of a time.\r\nThe attempts to apply on an international scale\r\ndomestic policies and local interpretations of values\r\nhave always failed. In the second half of the twentieth\r\ncentury, we witnessed the spectacular collapse of\r\nSoviet communism, which claimed to be the political\r\ndoctrine of the future, with which, following Hegel, we\r\nwould see the end of politics and therefore of history\r\nand enter into a sort of rebuilt earthly paradise. The\r\nclaimed communist universality saw the birth within\r\nitself of particularities and differences. Afterwards it\r\nhad to face other doctrines and world visions that were\r\nalien to its principles and values; and contrary to what\r\ncommunism expected, those different perspectives did\r\nnot vanish when faced with the presumed Marxist\r\ntruth. Rather, they won the ideological battle and made\r\ncommunism and Soviet Russia disappear. I am\r\nconvinced that the same will happen with any doctrine,\r\nwhatever its perspective and the values that support it,\r\nthat claims to lead the world to the end of history.\r\nThis forces us to rethink certain ideas that are too\r\nhastily — and, to my mind, inconsistently — becoming\r\ncommonplace. There is a certain scorn towards the idea\r\nof sovereignty and towards the idea of the cultural\r\nidentity of peoples, under the pretext of building a\r\nuniversal society. Nevertheless, I believe that, even\r\nthough they will need to be transformed and adapted to\r\na new globalizing outlook, those ideas will continue to\r\nprevail in the world of the future if we favour a\r\ngenuinely democratic way of thinking, in which\r\nfreedom can also exist under cultural and ideological\r\ndifferences.\r\nThere is no doubt that there is a crisis in the\r\nnation-State, because the seemingly essential\r\nidentification between the State as the political and\r\njuridical organization of society and the nation as a\r\ncultural organization is false: multinational States do\r\nexist. The solution in these cases of disparity between\r\nthe political and cultural organization is not to abandon\r\nthe concept of State and sovereignty, letting them be\r\nabsorbed within one of the supranational, globalizing\r\nconstructs; rather, it lies in achieving within the State\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\nan acknowledgement and complex integration of\r\nmulticulturality. It is necessary to articulate diversity at\r\nboth the State and international levels instead of\r\nimposing some sort of homogeneity that will always\r\nfeel like a strait-jacket.\r\nThe new international order cannot be built by a\r\nsingle nation, culture or ideology, but by the interaction\r\nof the different attitudes that make up humanity. From\r\na genuinely democratic and liberal point of view, we\r\nmust avoid the temptation of the new dogmatism,\r\nperversely subtle and with a powerful imperialist\r\nvocation: the myth of “political correctness”.\r\nIn this regard, building a new international order\r\nfor the twenty-first century does not mean solving a\r\nmathematical equation or scientifically designing a\r\nmodel to be applied generically to all the countries of\r\nthe world in a vain attempt to create a universal\r\ninternational society. Reality sweeps away all\r\nabstractions with the wealth of its multiple points of\r\nview. Moreover, reality is always dynamic and\r\neffervescent. It is always in a permanent state of\r\ntransformation, thanks to freedom, the defining\r\nelement of the human being.\r\nTherefore, politics, whether domestic or\r\ninternational, is an art, not a science. A domestic or\r\ninternational order must be the result of a complex\r\ninteraction between different, and even opposing,\r\nelements, just like a work of art. Creating the work of\r\nart that will be the new international order implies not\r\ndestroying what is counter to it, but, rather, combining\r\nit; combining unity with diversity and freedom with\r\norder. To put it in Nietzschean terms, we have to unite\r\nthe Apollonian with the Dionysian. To build a purely\r\nApollonian society is to fall into a new form of\r\ndogmatism and cultural dictatorship, even though,\r\nparadoxically, the intention is to establish democracy.\r\nBuilding a purely Dionysian society means slipping\r\ninto chaos and therefore destroying the social contract.\r\nThe society of the future must be capable of\r\nliving with diversity and expressing different points of\r\nview, world visions and interpretations of democracy\r\nitself in order to establish an organization of\r\nhumankind that creates not a single and homogenous\r\ninternational society, but an embodiment of the wealth\r\nof social and cultural diversity in search of peaceful\r\ncoexistence and reciprocal cooperation without burdens\r\nor conditions.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Estonia.\r\nMr. Ilves (Estonia): Allow me to begin, Sir, by\r\ncongratulating you on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. I wish you\r\nall the best in carrying out your duties. I would also\r\nlike to welcome the Republic of Tuvalu to the United\r\nNations.\r\nLast week my Prime Minister, Mart Laar, spoke\r\nto the Millennium Summit on a number of issues\r\nEstonia sees as being especially salient to the United\r\nNations this year. In my brief remarks today, I would\r\nlike to underline four in particular: first, the need to\r\nreform the Security Council; secondly, efforts to raise\r\nthe effectiveness of peacekeeping; thirdly, the\r\nimportance of narrowing the global gap between rich\r\nand poor; and, fourthly, the role of information\r\ntechnology in furthering development.\r\nThe first concerns efforts to reform the Security\r\nCouncil. The strong executive power vested in the\r\nCouncil was originally designed for the Council to\r\nprovide a venue for speedy decisions and subsequent\r\naction. In practice, however, the Council is\r\nincreasingly prone to indecisive waffling, which in turn\r\nundermines its own authority and credibility, and thus\r\nits effectiveness. In order to combat that effect, Estonia\r\nbelieves that the voting procedures and mechanisms\r\ngoverning the work of the United Nations most\r\npowerful body must be revamped.\r\nOne such procedure that deserves our attention is\r\nthe veto. Some permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil have used the veto, or have threatened to do\r\nso, in order to advance their own domestic and foreign\r\npolicy interests, irrelevant to the particular issue at\r\nhand. Because the Security Council derives its\r\nlegitimacy from all Member States, it is the duty of the\r\npermanent members to exercise their veto power\r\nresponsibly.\r\nThe composition of the Council, which still\r\nreflects the power relationships current in 1945, is\r\nanother issue that calls out for resolution. From the\r\ninception of the United Nations that year until just a\r\ndecade ago the people of my country were afforded\r\nonly rare glimpses of the goings-on at the United\r\nNations through tears in the fabric of the Iron Curtain.\r\nWhen we finally re-established our independence, in\r\n1991, we emerged onto the international arena only to\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.12\r\ndiscover that the Security Council, judging by its\r\ncomposition, was still stuck back in 1945. This strikes\r\nEstonia as being anachronistic, if not wrongheaded.\r\nThe guarantors of, and greatest contributors to, stability\r\nin the world have in the course of half a century\r\nchanged fundamentally. We need not fear opening a\r\ndiscussion on whether the moral and legal reasoning\r\nunderlying Security Council membership in the wake\r\nof the Second World War is still appropriate for the\r\ntwenty-first century. If countries have fundamentally\r\nchanged, so should, and so can, the United Nations.\r\nMy second point regards peacekeeping. Earlier\r\nthis year my Government decided to forgo the discount\r\nrate that meant paying only 20 per cent of our\r\npeacekeeping assessment. Instead, we voluntarily and\r\nunilaterally opted to shoulder 100 per cent of what is\r\nexpected of us. This is because Estonia regards\r\npeacekeeping as being among the United Nations most\r\ncrucial assignments in fulfilling its historical mandate\r\nof collective security. Security cannot be had at\r\ndiscount prices. That is why Estonia is willing to pay\r\nmore for what we hope will be a better product.\r\nPaying our own way is not enough to raise the\r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping, however. What we\r\nrequire, as Prime Minister Tony Blair said here last\r\nweek, is a far broader concept of security. The Security\r\nCouncil took an important step last week towards\r\nensuring the security of people and frontiers with its\r\nunanimous resolution to overhaul United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. Those changes should create\r\na more potent and better financed force that can react\r\nquickly where needed.\r\nMy third point focuses on the need to increase\r\nequality around the globe. In his millennium report, the\r\nSecretary-General called on all of us to focus on the\r\neradication of poverty. We can go a long way towards\r\nlevelling the playing field for all peoples by alleviating\r\ndebt and allocating more resources for development\r\nassistance. It is not as simple as that, however. As my\r\nPrime Minister, Mart Laar, said here last week, these\r\nefforts must go hand in hand with good governance and\r\nopen markets. Without a commitment to these two\r\nelements, no amount of aid or debt relief will bring us\r\ncloser to our intended goal.\r\nThe idea that open governments and open\r\nmarkets are a prerequisite for good economic\r\nperformance leads me to my fourth and final point,\r\nnamely, the role of information and communications\r\ntechnology in furthering development. In his\r\nmillennium report, the Secretary-General rightly\r\nstressed the need to ensure that the fruits of new\r\ntechnologies, especially information technology, are\r\navailable to all.\r\nI personally took part in the High-level Panel of\r\nExperts on Information and Communication\r\nTechnology, held here at the United Nations last April,\r\nbecause we have some experience in these matters.\r\nEstonia has the honour of finding itself among the 20\r\nmost computerized nations in the world. More\r\nimportantly, we have done this not as a rich country,\r\nbut as a nation with rather modest means.\r\nAmong the Panel’s most important findings was\r\nthe undisputed, if not terribly original, conclusion that\r\ninformation technology programmes are, in fact,\r\nbeneficial for development. Computer technology can\r\nbe a wedge, or it can be a bridge. It need not follow\r\nthat poor nations fall ever behind. Policies can be\r\nimplemented, as we have discovered, that turn the\r\n“digital divide” into a “digital dividend”.\r\nWe have seen this in my country firsthand\r\nthrough our Tiger Leap programme whereby every\r\nschool in Estonia has, for some time now, been\r\nconnected to the Internet. Even more clearly, we have\r\nwitnessed how access to information technology has\r\nbrought new possibilities to rural areas, the areas which\r\noften bear the brunt of change. This is why Estonia\r\nwholeheartedly endorses, and will actively participate\r\nin, the United Nations plans to assist all Members in\r\nmaking the information technology dream a reality.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
