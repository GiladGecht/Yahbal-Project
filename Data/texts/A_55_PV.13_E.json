(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Tonino Picula, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Croatia.\r\nMr. Picula (Croatia): Year after year, we gather\r\nunder this universal roof to join our minds and\r\nresources in order to make the world a safer and more\r\nprosperous place  or, at least, one a little less\r\nburdened with all the troubles we have been trying to\r\nresolve for decades but have so far not succeeded in\r\neradicating. Never before have we assembled in such\r\nnumbers and extent in the span of just a few weeks \r\nfirst the religious leaders, then the Parliamentarians,\r\nthen the heads of State and Government and, finally,\r\nthe representatives to the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfifth session. Let us hope that this unprecedented\r\ncongregation will not remain just a tribute to the dawn\r\nof the twenty-first century, but will emerge as a\r\nfoundation for a better United Nations and a better\r\nworld it has to serve.\r\nWhen our heads of State met at the Millennium\r\nSummit earlier this month, they unanimously agreed on\r\nthe importance of the United Nations for our common\r\nfuture. To say that the United Nations is the only\r\nOrganization that brings together all the countries of\r\nthe world would be stating the obvious, but we must\r\nnever underestimate the simple fact that this is the only\r\nglobal Organization with universal membership and\r\ncomprehensive scope that indeed belongs to all of\r\nus  to all the peoples of the world. This is where the\r\nultimate strength of the United Nations lies.\r\nUnfortunately, we have too often failed to recognize\r\nthis.\r\nSome haunting facts should not be forgotten: the\r\nfact that 1 billion people in this world of ours live on\r\nless than $1 a day; the fact that 1 billion people do not\r\nhave access to clean water; the fact that the last time\r\nthe number of Security Council members was\r\nexpanded was nearly four decades ago, at a time when\r\nthe overall United Nations membership was almost half\r\nof its current size.\r\nThe United Nations must amount to more than a\r\nresolution or a decision, a plenary meeting or informal\r\nconsultations. We all have to work together, to spare no\r\neffort to make the Organization more proficient, more\r\neffective and fully at the disposal of all its Member\r\nStates. That is why Croatia welcomes the millennium\r\nreport of the Secretary-General and shares his views on\r\nthe need for action to adapt the functioning of the\r\nOrganization to the challenges of the new century.\r\nThere is a growing need and plenty of room for\r\nimprovement along the lines of efficiency,\r\ntransparency, equality and good governance. There is\r\nno room for excuses or for delaying reforms any\r\nfurther. The time for reform is now.\r\nCroatia has been an active Member of the\r\nOrganization since its international recognition as a\r\nsovereign State in the early 1990s. At that time, in spite\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nof all our activities, Croatia was primarily the object of\r\nnumerous peacekeeping operations and endless debates\r\nwithin the Security Council. Today, Croatia is a major\r\ngenerator of peace and stability in South-East Europe,\r\nan active promoter and facilitator of democracy in the\r\nregion, a reliable partner and a member of numerous\r\nregional organizations and initiatives. We have not\r\nforgotten the difficult years when Croatia was on the\r\nreceiving end of United Nations activities. Today, we\r\nstand ready to put our expertise gained in peacekeeping\r\nand other fields to the service of peace and democracy.\r\nThe experience of the homeland war, as well as\r\nthe lessons learned during peacekeeping operations in\r\nCroatia, have served us well in Croatias active\r\nengagement in the United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmission in Sierra Leone. We are ready to expand our\r\nrole in peacekeeping and to actively participate in its\r\nconceptual development. Croatia welcomes and will\r\ncarefully study the recently published report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the reform of peace operations\r\nand the recommendations proposed.\r\nUnfortunately, the number of incidents with tragic\r\nconsequences involving members of peace missions all\r\nover the world is constantly increasing. Just few days\r\nago, three members of the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in\r\nAtambua in West Timor were brutally killed. One of\r\nthem was Pero imunda, a citizen of Croatia. I would\r\nlike to use this opportunity to pay tribute to him\r\npersonally and to all peacekeepers whose tireless\r\nefforts cost them their lives in performing their noble\r\ntasks in the line of duty.\r\nCroatia is currently a member of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, the central body of the United\r\nNations. The increasing development of the Council as\r\na forum for policy dialogue, together with its follow-up\r\ndimension of the major world conferences, adds\r\nimportant value to its work and puts a heavy workload\r\non its members.\r\nCroatias international responsibilities start with\r\nthose towards the region of South-East Europe. At the\r\nJanuary elections, citizens of Croatia demonstrated\r\ntheir strong commitment to democratic values, respect\r\nfor human and minority rights, the rule of law and\r\neconomic reforms. They opted for broad changes that\r\nwill bring them into the mainstream of the European\r\nintegration processes.\r\nThe new Croatian Government is well aware of\r\nall the responsibilities it has undertaken and all the\r\nopportunities that are arising. We firmly believe that\r\nCroatias leading role as a contributor to peace and\r\nsecurity in the region of South-East Europe will\r\nconsiderably contribute to turning this part of Europe\r\ninto an area of peace and prosperity.\r\nIn February, the Croatian Government adopted a\r\nprogramme that, as its primary goals, stresses\r\ndemocratic values, respect for human and minority\r\nrights, the return of refugees and displaced persons,\r\ngood-neighbourly relations and integration into the\r\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization. The new Government is determined to\r\nfulfil all Croatias ongoing international commitments\r\nand to assume new ones, if the need arises.\r\nThe elections in Croatia at the beginning of this\r\nyear resulted in important changes. They provided for\r\nan increased level of human rights protection and\r\nmedia freedom, as well as the acceleration of the return\r\nprocess. Important legislative revisions in the field of\r\nthe return of refugees have opened the door for the\r\nunimpeded return of all Croatian citizens, regardless of\r\ntheir ethnicity and without condition of reciprocity. All\r\nthe citizens of Croatia stand equal before the law in\r\nterms of the reconstruction of their houses and all other\r\nreturn-related rights. The Government of Croatia will\r\ndo its best to fully implement those laws.\r\nCroatia is mindful of the fact that the return of\r\nrefugees represents a necessary prerequisite for lasting\r\nstability in the region. In order to accelerate the process\r\nof return, the Croatian Government, in cooperation\r\nwith UNHCR, has prepared a special return project for\r\n16,500 persons, tailored to their needs. The necessary\r\narrangements for the return of refugees to both Croatia\r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina are to be made through\r\ncentral institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in line\r\nwith the new Croatian policy towards that country.\r\nAdditionally, to speed up the process of two-way return\r\nwith Republika Srpska, the former Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republika Srpska and I have signed a joint\r\ndeclaration on the facilitation of the return of refugees.\r\nThrough this document, we have committed ourselves\r\nto enabling the return of 2,000 people from each side,\r\nas well as to exchanging information and adjusting\r\nprocedures in that regard. I can proudly say that real\r\nprogress in the return process has been achieved.\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nAt the same time, I have to stress that the number\r\nof returns to Croatia by far exceeds the number of\r\nreturns of Croats to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nAdditional efforts have to be invested to speed up the\r\nreturn process of Croats and all others to Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. All the refugees have the right to return,\r\nbut they also have a right to stay in the areas where\r\nthey presently reside. For all those Bosnian Croats who\r\nwish to stay in Croatia, we have to provide appropriate\r\nhelp in finding new housing facilities.\r\nThe success of the return of refugees does not\r\ndepend solely on political and legal parameters. It has\r\nto be accompanied by the development of the State\r\neconomy and the local economy. The return process\r\nmust be sustained by job opportunities, small- and\r\nmedium-size enterprises, strengthening of the social\r\nfabric and adequate schools and health institutions, as\r\nwell as better living conditions generally. Otherwise,\r\nwe shall just turn returnees into economic migrants and\r\nthey will be on the road once again.\r\nNot a small part of legislative changes relates to\r\nthe protection of human and minority rights in Croatia.\r\nThe Croatian Government is of the opinion that the\r\nnecessary preconditions have been met for excluding\r\nCroatia from the omnibus resolutions on the situation\r\nof human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\r\nRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, which have been adopted by both the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Commission on Human\r\nRights, and for the exclusion of Croatia from the\r\nmandate of the Special Rapporteur derived from the\r\nCommissions resolution.\r\nImportant recognition of the progress Croatia has\r\nmade in respecting fundamental values of democracy,\r\nhuman rights and rule of law came recently from the\r\nCouncil of Europe. The Monitoring Committee of its\r\nParliamentary Assembly concluded last Friday that\r\nCroatia has honoured its obligations and most of its\r\ncommitments undertaken at the time of its accession to\r\nthe Council of Europe in 1996. Consequently, we\r\nexpect that the monitoring procedure will be formally\r\nclosed at the plenary session of the Parliamentary\r\nAssembly, at the end of this month.\r\nFor the Croatian Government, cooperation with\r\nthe International Tribunal in The Hague remains\r\nprimarily a legal issue, not a political one. The\r\nCroatian State Parliament adopted the Declaration on\r\nCooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in April,\r\nunambiguously affirming its support for the Tribunal,\r\nand this important document remains a framework for\r\nCroatias policy towards the ICTY. It is our firm\r\nposition that the guilt for the crimes committed must be\r\nindividualized: no nation can be held collectively\r\nresponsible for the crimes committed by war criminals\r\nclaiming to act in its name. In order to improve the\r\nquality of cooperation with the ICTY, the Government\r\nCouncil for cooperation with the ICTY has been\r\nconstituted and close working relations with the\r\nTribunal established.\r\nPromotion of good relations with its neighbours\r\nis Croatias high-priority goal. In its programme, the\r\nCroatian Government clearly stipulated that its\r\nrelations with Bosnia and Herzegovina are based on\r\ngood-neighbourliness, equality and transparency.\r\nCroatia will continue to cooperate with Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the international community in the\r\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement, which\r\nremains the foundation of Bosnia and Herzegovinas\r\nself-sustainability and the guarantee of the preservation\r\nof the national interests of its three constituent peoples.\r\nCroatias policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina rests\r\non full respect for the independence and sovereignty of\r\nthat country.\r\nCroatia sees this as the only way to a prosperous\r\nfuture for the Croatian people in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the care for whom remains our\r\nconstitutional obligation. Croatia will continue to\r\nsupport Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but it\r\nforesees doing this in a transparent way, in accordance\r\nwith the Dayton Agreement and with a clear Euro-\r\nAtlantic orientation.\r\nTransparent financing of the Croatian component\r\nof the Federation Army through the Standing\r\nCommittee on Military Matters is only one of the steps\r\naimed at enhancing the central institutions and concrete\r\nproof of the new Croatian policy towards Croats in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe relations between Croatia and Serbia cannot\r\nbe regarded outside the framework of the international\r\nisolation of the Milosević regime. Croatia is not\r\nquestioning at all the need to continue the\r\nnormalization process with the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, but its dynamics and substance will depend\r\non the democratization of Serbia, which remains one of\r\nthe necessary conditions for international and\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\neconomic stability in the region. Croatia hopes that the\r\nforthcoming elections in the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia will be conducted in a democratic way that\r\nreflects the true will of the people and that they will\r\nresult in democratic changes. Bearing in mind the fact\r\nthat the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope has been denied an opportunity to monitor the\r\nelections means that the elections could lose their\r\ninternational credibility. Still, Croatia wants to believe\r\nthat Serbia will find a way to end the present situation\r\nand join the mainstream of the political and economic\r\nintegration process in the region and Europe as a\r\nwhole.\r\nCroatia supports democratic developments in the\r\nYugoslav Republic of Montenegro. An open,\r\ndemocratic, multi-ethnic, stable and economically\r\nviable Montenegro is in the interest of Croatia and of\r\nthe region at large. In the course of this year a number\r\nof meetings have been held between the Croatian and\r\nMontenegrin officials at various levels, including the\r\nhighest level. Two border crossings between Croatia\r\nand Montenegro are operating without impediment, and\r\nfurther steps for enhanced cooperation, especially\r\neconomic ones, are under way. Croatia will continue to\r\nsupport the process of democratization that has already\r\nbegan in Montenegro and help in its opening towards\r\nEurope, firmly in line with the efforts of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nCroatia remains seriously concerned about the\r\npresent situation in Kosovo and continued violence,\r\nwhose victims are both Albanians and the Serbs. We\r\nhope that efforts of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) forces\r\nand civilian administration will be successful in\r\nbringing peace and stability to the region, as well as\r\nfacilitating preconditions for the return of refugees.\r\nOne issue, however, stands out in regard to the\r\nstability and lasting security of the whole region. It is\r\nthe question of succession of States created after the\r\ndissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nAn important aspect of the succession problem is\r\nthe question of membership of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia in the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations. The four successor States\r\nare of the opinion that this must be resolved in line\r\nwith the already existing Security Council and General\r\nAssembly resolutions. That means that the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia cannot automatically continue\r\nthe membership of the former State in the United\r\nNations, and therefore, that it should do what other\r\nsuccessor States have done  apply for membership as\r\nthe fifth successor. Moreover, the four successor States\r\nare of the opinion that the current practice in the\r\nUnited Nations should reflect the above-mentioned\r\nresolutions and be more consistent in that regard.\r\nTherefore, we call for immediate implementation of\r\nthose resolutions and emphasize once again the\r\nimportance of resolving the question of succession,\r\ndespite the rejection by the present Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia regime.\r\nThere are still a small number of United Nations\r\nmilitary observers within the international borders of\r\nCroatia. Their performance in Prevlaka, the\r\nsouthernmost part of my country, has considerably\r\ncontributed to the lasting solution to this problem,\r\nwhich is definitely one of security, not one of a\r\nterritorial nature. Since 1992, Croatia has accepted the\r\nUnited Nations mandate on Prevlaka, with the last six-\r\nmonth extension on 15 July this year. The steady\r\nnormalization of relations between Croatia and the\r\ndemocratic Government of Montenegro has\r\nconsiderably improved the situation on the ground and\r\nshould serve as a bedrock for a lasting solution for\r\nPrevlaka. In approaching the Prevlaka issue one has to\r\nrespect existing international borders, as well as\r\nlegitimate security concerns, land ownership rights and\r\nthe need for economic cooperation and development in\r\nthe region.\r\nThe stability of South-East Europe is an\r\ninseparable part of the overall European stability\r\narchitecture. Being at the same time a Central\r\nEuropean, Mediterranean, Danubian and South-East\r\nEuropean country, Croatia plays an active role in\r\nseveral regional initiatives that serve as a foundation\r\nfor stabilization, cooperation and development in our\r\npart of the world. Let me mention in this regard the\r\nCentral European Initiative, one of the oldest regional\r\ninitiatives, and the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative, the\r\nnewest.\r\nDuring its chairmanship of the Working\r\nCommunity of the Danube Region this year, Croatia\r\nwill host the traditional Conference of the heads of the\r\nregional Governments as well as the Economic and\r\nCultural Forum. Alpe Adria is another subregional\r\ninitiative in which Croatia plays an active role.\r\nCroatias role as an active observer in the South-East\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nEurope Cooperation Initiative additionally emphasizes\r\nour intention to contribute to regional security and\r\nstability.\r\nFrom the very outset, Croatia has actively\r\nengaged in the creation and implementation of the\r\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. This strategic\r\nprocess represents a comprehensive approach towards\r\nthe region in which the concept of stability includes\r\ndemocratization and human rights, economic\r\ndevelopment and security issues. Croatia has presented\r\nseveral project proposals to all three working tables of\r\nthe Stability Pact, the construction of the Adriatic-\r\nIonian highway being the most important of them. The\r\nconstruction of this highway, stretching along the\r\ncoastline from the Italian to the Greek border, would\r\nmean a significant improvement in road travel between\r\nthe countries of the region, and would also bring\r\neconomic development to the very part of the region\r\nthat most dearly needs it.\r\nI have the satisfaction of informing the Assembly\r\nthat at the beginning of this week Croatia hosted the\r\nparliamentary summit of the Stability Pact, which had\r\ncomplete success in strengthening the important\r\nparliamentary dimensions of the Pact.\r\nThe Stability Pact also serves as a mechanism for\r\nfacilitating the European Union (EU) and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership\r\nprospects for all those countries of South-East Europe\r\nthat wish to pursue this path. Croatia is one of them.\r\nFull integration into the EU and NATO is the priority\r\nstrategic objective of Croatian foreign policy.\r\nIn a brief span of six months Croatias\r\ninternational position regarding the European Union\r\nhas thoroughly changed. It has gone from being a\r\ncountry with no institutional relations with the\r\nEuropean Union to a country awaiting the start of\r\nnegotiations on a stabilization and association\r\nagreement and, consequently, candidacy for EU\r\nmembership. Croatia is very pleased with the results of\r\nthe joint consultative task force, whose\r\nrecommendations helped us to prepare the start of the\r\nnegotiations on the stabilization and association\r\nagreement. We are encouraged by the European\r\nCommission high representatives statements that this\r\ngeneration of agreements will be tailored according to\r\nthe present needs and achievements of the stabilization\r\nand association process countries, and that countries\r\nfurther progress towards European Union membership\r\nwill be assessed on their individual merits.\r\nIn late November Croatia will host a summit of\r\nthe European Union member States and the\r\nstabilization and association process countries \r\nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia. We\r\nfeel privileged to host such a historic meeting, one that\r\nwill signify the importance that the European Union\r\nattaches to the region within the framework of the\r\nUnions enlargement process. At the top of the Zagreb\r\nsummits agenda will be the issue of opening EU\r\nprospects to the region and the countries of South-East\r\nEurope. This is firmly in line with the policy of\r\ncreating one Europe without walls or curtains of\r\ndivision. We see the arrival of the EU heads of State or\r\nGovernment to Zagreb as a tribute to Croatias\r\ndemocratic achievements and a harbinger of our status\r\nof country associated with the European Union.\r\nIn May Croatia entered the Partnership for Peace.\r\nThis provided Croatia with an opportunity to contribute\r\nmore actively to the peace and security of the region\r\nand to strengthen its democracy and stability at the\r\nsame time. In parallel, Croatia has begun the\r\nsubstantial reconstruction and modernization of its\r\narmed forces, aiming to meet all NATO requirements\r\nas well as democratic standards.\r\nCroatia continues its active engagement in the\r\npivotal European organizations, such as the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and the Council of Europe. It has achieved\r\nsignificant progress in working together with the OSCE\r\non the improvement of security in the Danubian region\r\nthrough the engagement of OSCE civilian police\r\nmonitors there, as well as in other fields of\r\ncooperation, such as the improvement of democratic\r\nstandards in Croatia.\r\nWorld peace does not depend solely on peace and\r\nsecurity in Europe. It is with concern that we look at\r\nthe ongoing threat of new crises on the African\r\ncontinent, where tremendous amounts of human\r\nresources and money are feeding the war machines,\r\ninstead of serving to fuel development. The cause of\r\nour special concern lies in the fact that many armed\r\nconflicts in Africa erupt encouraged by and with the\r\nparticipation of neighbouring countries, often using\r\nforeign mercenaries who sometimes come even from\r\nEastern European countries. Croatia sees the\r\nimplementation of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nprinciples, as well as of the principles of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and other, subregional\r\norganizations, as an important element in the political\r\ndevelopments in that part of the world.\r\nThese organizations undertake commendable\r\nefforts in order to establish mechanisms for conflict\r\nprevention, as well as to find the ways to end the\r\nongoing crises. These efforts include the establishment\r\nof their own peacekeeping forces. In this regard,\r\nCroatia welcomes the determination of the African\r\ncountries to solve their problems regionally and with\r\nsupport from the United Nations.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to shift\r\nbetween the brink of war and the brink of peace. The\r\npeace process between the Israeli and Palestinian sides\r\nmust be maintained, and all of us should spare no effort\r\nto extend assistance and support to the accomplishment\r\nof this paramount task. From its own experience,\r\nCroatia is well aware of how important it is to\r\nstrengthen the peace process through Security Council\r\nand General Assembly resolutions that are supportive\r\nof it, both in language and in political substance. Thus,\r\nCroatia advocates that forthcoming resolutions on the\r\nMiddle East reflect all the aspects of the ongoing peace\r\nprocess, serving as an important impetus for its\r\nsuccessful completion.\r\nCroatia is a country highly contaminated by\r\nantipersonnel landmines, with about 1 million\r\nlandmines scattered over many parts of its territory.\r\nTheir presence poses serious obstacle to the economic\r\ndevelopment of the country, and even more so to the\r\nreturn of people to their homes. The mine-clearing\r\nprocess is under way, but it has to be intensified if real\r\nprogress is to be seen anytime soon. Many of the\r\nongoing activities are performed in cooperation with\r\ndonor countries, to which we extend our sincere\r\ngratitude; but maximum efforts have to be made to\r\neliminate this evil completely and for good. In this\r\nconnection, Croatia calls for further international\r\nassistance so as to enable the unimpeded development\r\nof the country at large.\r\nLet me briefly address the issue of the reform of\r\nthe Security Council. Croatia holds the view that the\r\npresent structure and functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil does not properly reflect the reality of\r\ninternational relations in the twenty-first century, or the\r\nneed for universal democratization. We support\r\nincreasing the number of permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats in the Council, taking into account\r\nequitable geographical distribution as well as\r\ncontributions to the United Nations budget. However,\r\nreform must go beyond the sole issue of membership\r\nenlargement. The Councils methods of work should be\r\nmade more transparent, in particular regarding informal\r\nconsultations, which have proved to be anything but\r\ninformal.\r\nThe subject of greatest concern is that, with the\r\nadvent of globalization, the number of people that are\r\nmarginalized and strongly affected by its negative\r\neffects is growing. Therefore, we have to minimize the\r\nnegative impacts of globalization and, at the same time,\r\nmake its benefits available to all.\r\nThe effects of globalization on the international\r\neconomy are significant and call for enhanced\r\ncooperation through multilateral institutions. In\r\naddition to the efforts aimed at avoiding\r\nmarginalization and at ensuring full integration into the\r\nworld economy, the countries with economies in\r\ntransition face challenges associated with privatization\r\nand structural and macroeconomic reforms. In the case\r\nof Croatia there is an additional challenge, that of the\r\npost-war recovery. In such circumstances, our pivotal\r\ngoal is to consolidate economic recovery and create\r\nconditions for sound and sustainable economic and\r\nsocial development. Our overall economic programme\r\nand policy measures are designed to support further\r\neconomic stability, with stable prices and low inflation,\r\nconcurrent economic growth, a faster rate of\r\nemployment and more exports.\r\nTo attract foreign investments that are so\r\nimportant for the ongoing process of development, a\r\nnew Investment Law has been adopted. Constructive\r\neconomic cooperation on bilateral, regional and global\r\nlevels remains Croatias firm goal. Croatia has recently\r\nsigned the Protocol of Accession to the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) and, within a few months, once\r\nthe process of ratification is completed, Croatia will\r\nbecome a full member of the WTO.\r\nThe challenges facing the Organization are\r\nnumerous. Answers will have to be found for questions\r\nregarding how to renew the structure and mandates of\r\nthe main United Nations bodies, how to ensure better\r\nmanagement and mobilization of new resources, how\r\nto define new forms of partnership, both with the\r\nprivate sector and with non-governmental\r\norganizations, how to make cooperation more effective\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nand, above all, how to turn the United Nations into a\r\nresult-based Organization. Croatia believes in the\r\npotentials of the United Nations and considers that it\r\nwill be made truly efficient if we  the Member\r\nStates  accept our responsibilities towards it.\r\nCroatia is ready to work together with all\r\ninternational actors in searching for the right answers\r\nto the challenges that lie ahead. Stability and prosperity\r\nof the world will become possible only if we never stop\r\nlooking for ways to improve them. Croatia will\r\ncontinue to use its best efforts to preserve the positive\r\ntrends in its general achievements and to contribute to\r\nEuropean and world stability.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to congratulate\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Foreign Minister of\r\nNamibia and the President of the fifty-fourth session of\r\nthe Assembly, on his dedicated work and on the great\r\nskills with which he performed his demanding job. I\r\nwould also like to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\nForeign Minister of Finland, on his election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session and to wish him all\r\nsuccess in his future work.\r\nFinally, I would like to express the hope that this\r\nMillennium Assembly will result in new commitments\r\nthat will bring progress in responding to the challenges\r\nof the new century.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Belgium, His Excellency, Mr. Louis\r\nMichel.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French):\r\nMr. President, I should first of all like to congratulate\r\nyou on your election to the Presidency of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish you every\r\nsuccess in this task which is both difficult and\r\ninspiring.\r\nAllow me to include in this tribute the Secretary-\r\nGeneral who has a crucial role in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation for peace, security, justice\r\nand development in the world.\r\nI fully associate myself with the speech made by\r\nmy French colleague, Mr. Hubert Vedrine, on behalf of\r\nthe European Union. His declaration covered quite\r\nbroadly European concerns regarding different regions\r\nof the world and the crises they continue to experience.\r\nLike my European colleagues, I will confine myself to\r\nrepeating the encouragements of the European Union\r\nfor the Israelis and Palestinians to seize this historic\r\nopportunity now within their reach to conclude a\r\nframework agreement in the coming weeks.\r\nThe new century is a blank page. It depends on us\r\nand on our Organization to provide the appropriate\r\nanswers to the challenges inherited from the past\r\ncentury. The Heads of State and Government who\r\ngathered here for the Millennium Summit set forth the\r\nobjectives that will mobilize our energy for the coming\r\nyears. I will only mention three of our highest\r\npriorities.\r\nFirst, world peace. This is the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council. It is therefore\r\nessential to bring the ongoing reforms to a successful\r\nconclusion and to improve the Councils legitimacy as\r\nwell as its representative character. To adapt the\r\nSecurity Council to the evolution of the world is the\r\nprimary condition for its ability to respond to our\r\nexpectations. Belgium coordinates a group of ten small\r\nand medium-sized countries in the quest for\r\nconstructive compromise formulas. Regarding the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council, the creation of ten\r\nnew seats, five permanent and five non-permanent,\r\nwith an equitable geographical distribution, seems to us\r\nto be a path worth exploring. As for the right of veto,\r\nwe have put forward a number of concrete and\r\nmoderate proposals seeking a voluntary and partial\r\nlimitation to the right of veto. Such a reform, a\r\nbalanced one along these lines and responding to the\r\nwishes of most Member States can, and should make\r\nsignificant progress in the months to come.\r\nSecondly, the elimination of poverty and\r\nattainment of sustainable development. The\r\nglobalization of the economy must proceed hand in\r\nhand with job creation and economic take-off in the\r\npoorest regions as well as with universally recognized\r\nsocial and environmental norms. There is no more\r\ndenying that great inequalities, differences in\r\ndevelopment, the lack of good governance and\r\ndisregard for human rights are factors which create\r\ninstability, both within States and among States in their\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThirdly, the defence and promotion of democracy\r\nand human rights. For us this requires equal\r\nparticipation of men and women in public life and\r\ndecision-making, as well as the fight against all forms\r\nof racism, intolerance, discrimination and xenophobia.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nSerious violations of human rights and universal values\r\nmust therefore never be allowed to go unpunished.\r\nThis also implies a permanent quest for the\r\nconditions, modalities and terms that underlie common\r\nhuman values. Democracy  and on this at least we\r\nshould all agree  is much more than a statement of\r\nfact regarding an established balance of power or an\r\narithmetic majority. It is a political morality that\r\nincludes loyal electoral behaviour. It is respect for, and\r\nencouragement of the open expression of differing\r\npoints of view. It is a frame of mind based on a lofty\r\nand optimistic conception of the human being.\r\nI say this because, even at home in our old\r\nEuropean democracies which one would consider safe\r\nand sheltered, we see reappearing the vile spectre of\r\nrejection of differences, exclusion and xenophobic or\r\nslanderous prejudice.\r\nEuropean parties are again raising and exalting\r\nwhat is most sordid and most barbarous in human\r\nnature. Saying nothing or resigning oneself to this fact\r\nis tantamount to trivializing the phenomenon and\r\ntrivialization means corruption of the spirit.\r\nI say this also because we must recognize that our\r\npolitical systems, in theory well equipped to withstand\r\nsuch assaults, unfortunately tend all too often to give in\r\nto the temptation to minimalize them under the\r\nspecious invocation of so-called higher demands of\r\nrealpolitik.\r\nIt is not my purpose here to allege some moral\r\nsuperiority but simply to remind ourselves that history\r\nalways exacts a price when one refuses to learn from\r\nits lessons.\r\nBelgium has participated over the past decade in\r\nnumerous peacekeeping operations under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations, among others in Somalia,\r\nRwanda and in the Balkans.\r\nReviewing these experiences, the Belgian Senate\r\nissued a detailed report in December 1997 containing\r\nrecommendations that prefigure, to some extent, the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Brahimi report. I\r\nwill point out a few aspects on which there is complete\r\nconvergence between the two reports.\r\nFirst, United Nations forces must be prepared to\r\nconfront the worst case scenario. The Blue Helmets\r\nmust be trained, equipped and commanded for such an\r\neventuality.\r\nSecondly, these forces must have at their disposal\r\nall relevant information, as well as the capacity to\r\nanalyse such information in terms of strategy and\r\ntactics, so they must be able to rely on an effective\r\nintelligence capability.\r\nThirdly, troop-contributing countries must be\r\nclosely involved in the preparation of the mandates and\r\nin the management of operations. The Assembly will\r\nnot be surprised to hear me plead for the\r\nrecommendations formulated in the Brahimi report to\r\nreceive wide support of all Member States. I hope that\r\nall actors concerned  the Member States, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Secretariat  prove their\r\ndetermination and their will to extend reforms to all\r\nlevels and bodies of the Organization. I pledge the full\r\nsupport of the Belgian Government to Deputy\r\nSecretary-General Louise Fréchette, who is responsible\r\nfor their implementation.\r\nI would also like to point out that, in our opinion,\r\nthe conclusions of the Brahimi report cannot be\r\ndissociated from other discussions to be held during the\r\nfifty-fifth session, specifically those on the revision of\r\nthe scale of assessments for peacekeeping budgets. In\r\nthis regard as well, Member States will have to keep an\r\nopen mind in order to set up an equitable system of\r\nfinancial burden sharing that is adapted to the current\r\nshape of the world.\r\nAnother sensitive question manifests itself clearly\r\nin the light of recent experiences, namely the proper\r\nrole of the United Nations in relation to regional\r\norganizations, and indeed even in relation to the\r\ninitiatives of neighbouring States in a conflict zone.\r\nLessons to be learned from the Yugoslav crisis are not\r\nthe same as those that can be drawn from recent crises,\r\nparticularly those in Africa. The goal in this regard is\r\nnot to deny the merits of the regional approach. On the\r\ncontrary, Belgium supports the creation of regional\r\nrapid reaction forces in the service of peacekeeping, as\r\nwas underlined one week ago by our Prime Minister,\r\nGuy Verhofstadt, before this very body.\r\nIt has to do more with highlighting the fact that\r\nthe merits of the regional approach clearly can never\r\njustify inaction on behalf of the international\r\ncommunity or some sort of oratory diplomacy that\r\npasses off solving problems to regional bodies and\r\norganizations or to temporary coalitions. The Security\r\nCouncil, as the supreme authority in matters of peace\r\nand security, must be able to play its role, although it\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nshould certainly be possible to refer some tasks to\r\nregional institutions most able to take action.\r\nI would like to make one last observation\r\nregarding preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping. The\r\narsenal at the disposal of the United Nations is not\r\nlimited to sending troops. Other means are available\r\nand, moreover, have been used repeatedly during recent\r\nyears. I am referring to sanctions, and in particular to\r\neconomic sanctions. This type of coercive measure, if\r\napplied by the Security Council in accordance to the\r\nCharter, can indeed produce the results envisaged when\r\ntheir use is well targeted and limited in time or when\r\nthey are inscribed in a realistic timeframe. But\r\nexperience also shows that when they are applied\r\nindiscriminately or when they serve overtly ambitious\r\npolitical objectives, their effectiveness tends to\r\ndecrease after a certain amount of time, and they may\r\neven produce results wholly opposite to the ones\r\ninitially envisaged. It is increasingly rare for sanctions\r\nto be an useful instrument. Too often, they only\r\npenalize populations without reaching the targeted\r\nrulers, who often understand how to exploit the\r\nboomerang effect of such sanctions.\r\nI would like to move now to a subject dear to my\r\nheart, Central Africa. During the past year, my country\r\nhas expressed strongly its desire to be involved in, and\r\nto contribute to, the mobilization of the international\r\ncommunity in support of the Lusaka peace process. It\r\nis essential that all Congolese parties engage resolutely\r\nand without preconditions in a dialogue, as they agreed\r\nto do in Lusaka. It is equally essential that our\r\nOrganization and its Members who have the means to\r\ndo so support the rapid deployment of the United\r\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUC), even though some\r\nof the conditions and modalities of that operation may\r\nhave to be reviewed in the light of the Brahimi report.\r\nOne thing is certain: without the presence of a\r\npeacekeeping force there will be no peace. Nor will\r\nthere be peace, or even a permanent cessation of\r\nhostilities, without a dialogue between the Congolese\r\nparties. Both these questions are obviously linked. In\r\norder to overcome the current impasse it is essential to\r\nmake progress where possible. It therefore seems to us\r\nthat the problem should not be stated in terms of\r\npreconditions, order of events or priorities. In any\r\nevent, the responsibility of the Security Council and\r\nthe international community remain in place. Without a\r\npolitical leap by the parties to the conflict, and without\r\nthe necessary material support of the international\r\ncommunity, the peace process is doomed to fail.\r\nIn Burundi, where action by the countries of the\r\nregion and the remarkable facilitation undertaken by\r\nformer Presidents Nyerere and Mandela have started to\r\nyield promising yet still incomplete results, it is also\r\ntime for our Organization and the principal donor\r\ncountries to act to consolidate the gains achieved and\r\nto set the country once and for all on the path to peace\r\nand development. It is in this spirit that Belgium will\r\nparticipate actively in the meeting organized by the\r\nEuropean Commission that is to be held in Brussels on\r\n15 September to prepare for the donors conference\r\nsoon to be convened by France on the request of\r\nNelson Mandela.\r\nRegardless of how well-intentioned they may be,\r\nefforts in the cause of peace can sometimes be to little\r\navail, given the greed and rivalries fuelled by the\r\nillegal exploitation of local resources. Resources\r\nattained in that way are financing wars, which\r\nthemselves become a source of profit. The problem of\r\nthe diamond trade in conflict areas is at the centre of\r\nthis question. We know that war diamonds represent\r\nonly a fraction of international trade, but these illegal\r\nrevenues nevertheless contribute to destabilizing the\r\nsituation, encourage the logic of war and spread\r\ncorruption and anarchy. Belgium is active in the efforts\r\nto create a global system of verification. It is high time\r\nindeed to put in place a realistic and effective legal\r\nframework binding on everyone in order to regulate the\r\ntrade in diamonds.\r\nI would now like to speak about non-proliferation\r\nand disarmament. Last April, during the Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Belgium intervened\r\nvigorously to express its concerns regarding a certain\r\nnumber of elements that could lead to the weakening or\r\nputting into question the very foundation of the non-\r\nproliferation regime negotiated in recent decades. We\r\ncertainly welcome the conclusions of the Conference\r\nand the reflection that it triggered. That has led to a\r\nfavourable climate for the implementation of the plan\r\nof action. That being said, numerous States still refuse\r\nto adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, while others\r\nhave not yet ratified the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nWe have followed closely, and with some\r\nconcern, the debate in the United States on anti-\r\nballistic defence. Belgium is not opposed in principle\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nto the idea of anti-missile defence. We are only stating\r\nthat the political perception, the analysis of the threat\r\nand the means to counter it vary greatly from region to\r\nregion. There is no unique or universal response, but\r\nwhat is essential is to make sure that an anti-missile\r\nsystem, whatever it may be, should contribute to\r\ngeneral stability and to the consolidation of mutual\r\nconfidence. In other words, the decisions will have to\r\nbe taken not only on the basis of a strategic and\r\ntechnical analysis, but also on a consensual basis that\r\nbuilds upon the overall political and strategic balance.\r\nWe welcome the decision by the American\r\nAdministration to postpone its decision on the\r\nlaunching of a programme. Besides the question of the\r\nfeasibility of such a programme, its unilateral nature\r\nwould have a negative impact on our common\r\ndisarmament objectives. We now hope that this\r\ndecision will encourage negotiations for a START III\r\nagreement between the United States and Russia. Rapid\r\nprogress on a new, substantial reduction of strategic\r\nnuclear arms could in turn lead to breaking the impasse\r\nin negotiations for a fissile materials cut-off treaty at\r\nthe Disarmament Commission in Geneva.\r\nBelgium also welcomes heartily the adherence to\r\ndate by 138 States to the Convention on the prohibition\r\nof anti-personnel mines. Further efforts have to be\r\nmade in order to implement it and mobilize the\r\nnecessary funding to eliminate these especially\r\ninhumane weapons forever.\r\nI have dwelled mainly on peace and international\r\nsecurity. I would like to turn to the two other subjects\r\nthat Belgium considers a priority in the programme of\r\naction of the Millennium Summit. Without these\r\npriorities, our efforts in the field of security would be\r\nfruitless. I am referring to universal respect for human\r\nrights and worldwide development.\r\nThe protection of human rights is a leading\r\nfeature of my countrys foreign policy. Our\r\nparticipation in the Commission on Human Rights will\r\nenable us to further enlarge our initiatives and our\r\npolitical action. We will be able to act more directly in\r\nthe fields where we have a particular interest, such as\r\nthe fight against racism and xenophobia, and the rights\r\nof the child. Belgium was actively involved in the\r\nnegotiation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child aimed at sparing children as\r\nmuch as possible from the suffering and consequences\r\nof armed conflict. The signing of that Protocol on the\r\noccasion of the Millennium Summit, as well as our\r\ncountrys signature of the second Protocol, on sexual\r\nexploitation of children, are specific signs of our\r\ncommon will to reinforce the protection of the rights of\r\nthe child.\r\nI would like to reiterate my countrys wish to see\r\nthe death penalty permanently abolished all over the\r\nworld. I also appeal to countries that are not in a\r\nposition to do so at this time to adopt a moratorium as\r\na transitional measure. We certainly cannot accept the\r\ndeath penalty still being implemented in cases of those\r\nwho were minors at the time of the offence, pregnant\r\nwomen or the mentally ill.\r\nWe are following very closely the evolution of\r\ninternational law and jurisprudence aimed at\r\ncondemning persons convicted of crimes against\r\nhumanity. My country has been at the forefront of\r\nnational legislation in this context and hopes that these\r\nmeasures can serve as a deterrent and an example for\r\nother States. We have just ratified the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, and we are encouraging\r\nother States to do the same in support of this important\r\ncommitment.\r\nLet me say a few words on globalization and its\r\nproblems. Globalization is the expression of an\r\ninevitable technological evolution. It makes little sense\r\nto condemn this evolution as a whole, for it is natural\r\nand has many positive effects, but we need to channel\r\nits dynamics towards real economic and social progress\r\nfor the well-being of a larger number of people. But the\r\nglobalization of the economy and trade cannot simply\r\nmean the renunciation of our political and institutional\r\nresponsibilities. The risk is very real. We are already\r\nwitnessing a form of abandonment of responsibilities in\r\nthe case of Governments and Parliaments confronted\r\nby the gigantic challenges of globalization and the\r\nalmost impossible task of dealing with them at the\r\nnational level. In the absence of a really effective and\r\nrecognized global authority, the dynamics of\r\nglobalization could lead us into a political vacuum.\r\nThere will be no new economic world order without a\r\nnew political world order in which national democratic\r\ninstitutions, politically representative and accountable,\r\ncan play a role. This is another challenge facing our\r\nOrganization and its Member States. We will have to\r\nprovide an answer in the new millennium.\r\nThe United Nations system is at the heart of the\r\nissue of globalization, whose effects are becoming\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nmore and more evident. Questions have been raised;\r\nnow it is time to find the answers. We are convinced\r\nthat only the United Nations system, with all its\r\nspheres of activity, is in a position to harmonize global\r\neconomic development with human development.\r\nHere, more than anywhere else, we realize that human\r\nbeings, wherever they come from, share a high degree\r\nof common aspirations, as well as the same fears, the\r\nsame needs and the same dreams. This belief has to\r\nguide us in all our actions, both here and at home.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of South Africa.\r\nMs. Dlamini-Zuma (South Africa): Allow me to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of\r\nthe stewardship of this historic Assembly and also to\r\ncongratulate your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\non his sterling guidance of the Assemblys work during\r\nthe previous session.\r\nThe dawn of the new millennium offers us a\r\nunique opportunity to reflect on the successes and\r\nfailures of the United Nations since its inception. It\r\nalso provides us with an opportunity to dream about the\r\nfuture of humanity in the third millennium. The\r\nfounders of the United Nations based the Charter on\r\nthe assertion of human dignity, human rights and the\r\nequality of women and men and the aim of promoting\r\nbetter social standards. Indeed, billions of people today\r\nenjoy human rights and live in dignity, free from\r\ndisease, ignorance and fear, enjoying the benefits of\r\ntechnology and scientific advances and able to take full\r\nadvantage of the process of globalization. Equally,\r\nthere are billions who are humiliated, degraded and\r\nstripped of their innate human dignity and worth by\r\npoverty, disease, ignorance, homelessness, hunger and\r\nwars.\r\nThis Assembly, following the very inspiring\r\nMillennium Summit, provides us with an opportunity\r\nto reflect on the wise words of the leaders of the world\r\nand on the Declaration they adopted. Global consensus\r\nhas at last emerged and confirms that we live in one\r\nworld and belong to the same human race; therefore,\r\nwhile each Government has the responsibility to take\r\ncare of its citizens, we all have to work together for the\r\ngood of humanity as a whole. This means that we have\r\nto create a people-centred world that is more caring,\r\nwith a strong sense of solidarity, where we are all our\r\nbrothers and sisters keepers, if I may borrow those\r\nwords from the Bible.\r\nThere is also universal consensus now that while\r\nbillions of people are being degraded and dehumanized\r\nby poverty, disease and hunger, there are indeed\r\nenough resources in the world to feed, educate and\r\nrestore the dignity of all human beings and make this\r\nworld a better place for all. It is therefore clear that the\r\neradication of hunger and poverty should be the\r\npriority of all priorities and should be our collective\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThere is also agreement that we have a collective\r\nresponsibility in dealing with infectious diseases, such\r\nas malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases, especially HIV/AIDS. There is a need to\r\nmobilize material and human resources, provide better\r\ninfrastructure, provide health education and ensure\r\naccess to affordable medicine.\r\nThere is also consensus that Africa poses the\r\nbiggest development challenge. The success or failure\r\nof the United Nations and of humankind as a whole in\r\nthis century will be determined by their success in\r\ndealing with the African development challenge.\r\nWe would like to urge the United Nations, in\r\npartnership with the Organization of African Unity and\r\nregional organizations, to accelerate the work towards\r\npeace and stability in many of the countries of our\r\ncontinent, such as Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Eritrea,\r\nSomalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Sudan and Burundi, so that these countries may\r\ntake their rightful place in the continent, be seized with\r\nthe needs of their people, promote development,\r\nproduce and export goods and not be areas of perpetual\r\nsuffering and war that result in their being the net\r\nexporters of refugees. We welcome the Brahimi report\r\nand are studying it, as it contains very serious\r\nsuggestions about the future operations of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe United Nations, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil, is humanitys principal agent for collective\r\nsecurity and it needs urgent reform so as to be able to\r\nlive up to this solemn responsibility. The world has\r\nchanged dramatically and continues to do so. It is\r\nimperative that the composition and role of the\r\nSecurity Council reflect that change and not remain\r\nobsolete. The Bretton Woods institutions are equally in\r\nneed of urgent reform in order to discharge their\r\nmandate and respond to the new development\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nchallenge. The World Trade Organization has to adapt\r\nits international trade rules so that they are equitable\r\nand fair and take account of global development\r\nchallenges.\r\nIt is a source of great concern to the developing\r\ncountries that, increasingly, decisions are taken outside\r\nthe United Nations and other global structures by\r\ndeveloped and rich countries when these decisions\r\nhave a great impact on the poorer countries and\r\ndirectly affect the lives of billions of poor people. That\r\nis why a partnership between poor and rich countries\r\nand dialogue between North and South are so critical.\r\nNuclear weapons still constitute a threat to our\r\nplanet. We have to pursue the path of universal\r\ndisarmament and the destruction of all weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nThe need to protect the environment has assumed\r\ngreater importance and we can succeed only if we work\r\ntogether.\r\nThe self-determination of the people of East\r\nTimor, Western Sahara and Palestine must be a concern\r\nto all of us. To this end, we urge the United Nations to\r\ndo all it can to expedite the processes in East Timor\r\nand Western Sahara. We commend the peace efforts in\r\nthe Middle East and the role of the United States. We\r\nwould like to pledge our support to the Palestinian and\r\nIsraeli leaderships as they try to find creative solutions\r\nto their problems. They must be urged to take\r\nadvantage of this unique historic moment, as it seems\r\nthat a real possibility exists for a solution.\r\nThe equality of women and men still remains a\r\nsubject of great concern. All we need to do is look\r\naround this Hall to realize how far we are from\r\nrealizing the vision of the founding Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. Secondly, the feminization of poverty\r\nis a big problem. The marginalization of women, both\r\nin their countries and in the multilateral forums, means\r\nthat our countries and organizations, including the\r\nUnited Nations, are functioning at half-capacity and are\r\ndeprived of the unique qualities, energies and creativity\r\nthat women would bring. In this context, I cannot\r\nforget the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. She\r\ndeserves active support from this gathering and the\r\nworld.\r\nThe United Nations was founded in part to make\r\nsure that the monsters of fascism and racism should not\r\nrear their ugly heads again. Unfortunately, all over the\r\nworld racism and xenophobia are on the increase.\r\nSome countries and regions are responding by\r\ndeveloping a new fortress mentality, which does not\r\nhelp the situation. This should flash red warning lights\r\nto all of us and activate our utmost vigilance against\r\nthe scourges of racism and xenophobia.\r\nIt is only when we turn our backs on racism,\r\nxenophobia and other forms of discrimination that we\r\ncan succeed in building a caring world where we feel\r\ndiminished by the suffering and hunger of other human\r\nbeings. It was for this reason that we felt a sense of\r\nobligation and agreed to host the world racism\r\nConference next year. Of course, our country and\r\npeople experienced the most systematic, most brutal\r\nand most inhumane form of racism, which the United\r\nNations declared a crime against humanity. We are\r\nhappy to take our place in the fight against racism in\r\nour country and in the world. It is our fervent hope that\r\nthe Conference will come up with a programme of\r\naction against racism, xenophobia and other forms of\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nIn conclusion, let us all put our collective will,\r\ncourage and intellectual creativity together in shaping\r\nthe dream of a better world; a world of solidarity; a\r\nworld where no child should starve or die of\r\npreventable and curable diseases; a world where no\r\nchild will be deprived of schooling; a world where\r\nchildren will not be sent to war; a world where no child\r\ncan be a slave or be used as an object for trafficking; a\r\nworld where children grow up as children and play\r\nwith toys and do not have to be breadwinners or worry\r\nabout where their next meal is going to come from; a\r\nworld where women will enjoy all rights and where the\r\neradication of poverty and war is our collective\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe dream for the new millennium is indeed\r\nrealisable. If we act with courage and determination,\r\nwe can turn the hopes of billions across the world into\r\nreality.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Yohei Kono, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Japan.\r\nMr. Kono (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): First, I would like to\r\nextend my heartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, a\r\nformer Prime Minister of the Republic of Finland, on\r\nyour assumption of the office of President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nI would also like to pay my respects to Mr. Theo-\r\nBen Gurirab, Foreign Minister of the Republic of\r\nNamibia, for all his efforts during his tenure as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession.\r\nIt is also my great pleasure to welcome the\r\nadmission of Tuvalu as a new Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nBefore proceeding to my main topic, I would like\r\nto mention two important developments that took place\r\nin the international community in recent months.\r\nConcerning the situation on the Korean peninsula, the\r\nrecent inter-Korean summit was indeed epoch-making\r\nand I strongly hope that this positive development will\r\ncontinue, advance in the future and lead to peace and\r\nstability in North-East Asia. With regard to the Middle\r\nEast peace process, Japan is very much encouraged by\r\nthe commitment of both parties to continuing their\r\nnegotiations and, together with the international\r\ncommunity, will strongly support the efforts of the\r\nparties to achieve a lasting peace in the region.\r\nIn order to ensure that the twenty-first century is\r\ntruly a century of peace, it is of the greatest importance\r\nthat the international community make united efforts to\r\naddress the issues of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nIn 1945, Hiroshima and Nagasaki became the first\r\ntwo cities in human history to suffer indescribable\r\nnuclear devastation. That experience is the starting\r\npoint of Japans actions aimed at the realization of a\r\nworld free of nuclear weapons. With succeeding\r\ngenerations in this half-century, the extremely shocking\r\nexperiences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki might very\r\nwell be pushed to the edge of our memory. In such\r\ncircumstances, new signs of proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons and missiles are arousing our concern. I\r\nbelieve, however, that engraving the tragic experiences\r\nof Hiroshima and Nagasaki in our minds is the first\r\nstep toward the creation of a world free from the\r\nnuclear threat, which is one of the biggest challenges\r\nfacing the United Nations. In light of such experiences,\r\nJapan has maintained the three non-nuclear principles\r\nas its fundamental national policy and has focused\r\nparticular attention on nuclear issues. It will continue\r\nto stress the importance of this issue.\r\nSince the Second World War, we have adopted as\r\nthe basic ideas of our nation: democracy, commitment\r\nto peace and respect for fundamental human rights,\r\nwhich are enshrined in the Japanese Constitution.\r\nMoreover, under its basic policy of not becoming a\r\nmilitary power, Japan has mobilized all its available\r\nresources for the prosperity of its people and achieved\r\neconomic development. It hopes to utilize that\r\nexperience and make a further contribution to the\r\neconomic development and enhancement of the welfare\r\nof developing countries.\r\nThroughout my political career, I have been\r\ndeeply committed to nuclear disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation issues. A senior politician for whom I\r\nhave great respect once told me with great fervour:\r\nI hope that somebody among the peoples\r\nof the world will take the lead in advocating\r\npeace, and that all others will cooperate for that\r\ncause, so that the earth will avoid a crisis. I\r\nbelieve that Japan must play the role of that\r\nsomebody.\r\nThese words have become my political credo, as\r\nwell as the resolve of many Japanese people. When I\r\nwas Foreign Minister in 1994, Japan submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the first time a resolution\r\nentitled Nuclear disarmament with a view to the\r\nultimate elimination of nuclear weapons (49/75 H),\r\nwhich gained the support of an overwhelming majority\r\nof Member States. Japans support of the indefinite\r\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1995 is attributed to the\r\nstrong will of the Japanese people. I highly appreciate\r\nthe final document adopted at the 2000 NPT Review\r\nConference this spring, since it contains practical steps\r\nto be taken in the future in the fields of nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, including an\r\nunequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total\r\nelimination of nuclear arsenals. I also appreciate the\r\npostponement by the United States Government of its\r\ndecision to deploy a national missile defence, as a\r\nresult of prudent consideration with an emphasis on\r\nfurther dialogue on this important issue. Japan hopes\r\nthat this announcement will inspire a further deepening\r\nof the discussion on issues surrounding national missile\r\ndefence. I hope other countries respond to this move by\r\ntaking actions to avoid a vicious circle of an arms race\r\nand to create a beneficent circle toward nuclear\r\ndisarmament. The international community must\r\ncontinue its efforts aimed at non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and demand that the\r\nnuclear weapon States further reduce their nuclear\r\narsenals. This will definitely require a further reduction\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nby the United States and Russia in their nuclear\r\nweapons through the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks\r\n(START), as well as efforts by other nuclear weapon\r\nStates, unilaterally or through their negotiations, to\r\nreduce their nuclear arsenals. I also believe that we\r\nmust seriously consider what kind of practical paths we\r\nshould take to realize a world free from the fear of\r\nnuclear weapons. A world free of nuclear weapons is\r\nnot a dream; it is within our reach.\r\nMr. José Roberto Andino Salazar (El Salvador),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nTo that end Japan will submit to this session of\r\nthe General Assembly a draft resolution on the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons, which sets forth a path\r\ntowards the realization of a world free of nuclear\r\nweapons, while ensuring the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass-destruction. It does so through\r\nmeasures such as the early entry into force of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and\r\nthe immediate commencement and early conclusion of\r\nnegotiations on the fissile material cut-off treaty, as\r\nwell as the promotion of the Strategic Arms Reduction\r\nTreaty III negotiations, and through further, deeper\r\nreductions at a later stage in nuclear arsenals, leading\r\nin the final stage to total elimination. Japan expects\r\nthat this resolution will gain wide support from the\r\ninternational community.\r\nFurther, I would like to point out the importance\r\nof concluding negotiations on the protocol to the\r\nBiological Weapons Convention (BWC) by the year\r\n2001, and strengthening efforts to cope with missile\r\nproliferation.\r\nNow I would like to discuss international efforts\r\nfor conflict prevention. For the effective prevention of\r\nconflicts, it is important to employ various policy\r\nmeasures in a comprehensive and effective manner. As\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan advocates, it is\r\nincumbent upon the international community to nurture\r\na culture of prevention. The G-8 Miyazaki Initiatives\r\nfor Conflict Prevention, which was drawn up at the G-8\r\nForeign Ministers meeting in Miyazaki, over which I\r\npresided, embodies this idea of a culture of\r\nprevention.\r\nOn the issue of small arms and light weapons, in\r\nwhich Japan has been actively engaged, the G-8\r\ncountries made clear for the first time that they will not\r\nauthorize the export of small arms if there is a clear\r\nrisk that these might be used for repression or\r\naggression against another country. I hope this\r\nachievement will lead to the success of next summers\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Moreover,\r\nat Japans initiative, a fund relating to small arms was\r\nestablished at the United Nations this spring. The\r\npurpose of this fund is to extend assistance for the\r\ncollection of small arms and the reintegration of ex-\r\ncombatants into civilian society.\r\nUnder the G-8 Miyazaki Initiatives for Conflict\r\nPrevention, we will actively work to strengthen such\r\ndevelopment assistance that contributes to preventing\r\nthe outbreak or recurrence of conflicts. For this\r\npurpose, Japan will promote its collaboration with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations by, for example, providing\r\nassistance for their emergency humanitarian activities\r\nand dispatching joint study missions for emergency\r\nrehabilitation.\r\nIn recent years, United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations have had to be deployed more rapidly.\r\nMoreover, as the examples of Kosovo and East Timor\r\nhave shown, peacekeeping operations are now required\r\nto carry out diverse mandates that include humanitarian\r\nassistance, emergency rehabilitation and even civil\r\nadministration. To make possible the rapid and\r\neffective deployment of such peacekeeping operations,\r\nstrengthening the Secretariats functions as well as\r\nmore, quick-response cooperation on the part of the\r\ninternational community are all the more important.\r\nJapan welcomes the report and recommendations by\r\nthe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations\r\nestablished at the initiative of the Secretary-General.\r\nThe continued high toll in human life among\r\nUnited Nations personnel taking part in peacekeeping\r\noperations and humanitarian missions is a matter of\r\nprofound concern. Recently there was an unforgivable\r\nmilitia attack on the local office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in West\r\nTimor. Measures must be taken to ensure the safety of\r\nUnited Nations personnel through close cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations, the country concerned,\r\nand its neighbouring countries.\r\nWith regard to United Nations peace operations,\r\nJapan intends to continue to do its best, including\r\npersonnel and financial contributions to peacekeeping\r\noperations and assistance for emergency rehabilitation,\r\ndemocratization and the establishment of legal\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nframeworks, as well as assistance to international\r\norganizations.\r\nPoverty reduction is a high-priority issue for the\r\nleader of every country. Japan, consistently aware of\r\nthe importance of this issue, has been providing more\r\naid than any country in the world for nine consecutive\r\nyears, since 1991. Henceforth, considering what would\r\nbe most effective for the development of developing\r\ncountries, Japan will continue to make active efforts on\r\ndevelopment issues in cooperation with those\r\ncountries. It accordingly intends to contribute towards\r\nthe success of the high-level international and\r\nintergovernmental event on financing for development\r\nexpected to be held in 2001 under the aegis of the\r\nUnited Nations and others.\r\nMoreover, it is extremely valuable that\r\ndeveloping countries that have achieved certain levels\r\nof development put their own experience and know-\r\nhow to use in providing assistance to other developing\r\ncountries. Japan, in collaboration with the United\r\nNations and other organizations, will strengthen its\r\nendeavours for South-South cooperation.\r\nConcerning Africa, where poverty is an especially\r\nserious issue, Japan twice hosted the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD)  in 1993 and 1998. It intends to continue to\r\nactively cooperate for African development through the\r\nTICAD process. Bearing in mind the possibility of also\r\nhosting a third such conference, Japan is considering\r\nholding a ministerial-level meeting before the end of\r\nfiscal year 2001, and would like to ask for the\r\ncooperation of the countries and organizations\r\nconcerned.\r\nIn April Japan hosted the second Japan-South\r\nPacific Forum summit meeting, at which it, together\r\nwith small island States burdened with geographically\r\ndisadvantageous conditions, put forward a common\r\nvision and a course for mid- and long-term\r\ncooperation. Moreover, this fall Japan will hold the\r\nfirst ministerial-level conference with the countries of\r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM). As for the\r\nissue of sustainable development in landlocked States,\r\nit is Japans policy to extend active cooperation for the\r\nimprovement and development of their transportation\r\ninfrastructure, and other matters.\r\nRegarding the debt problem of the heavily\r\nindebted poor countries, Japan has decided to\r\ncontribute up to a total of $200 million to the Trust\r\nFund of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\n(HIPC) Initiative of the World Bank. It will continue to\r\nmake its utmost efforts for the speedy and effective\r\nimplementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative, for\r\nexample, by extending technical assistance to heavily\r\nindebted poor countries as they prepare their poverty-\r\nreduction strategies.\r\nAs we enter the twenty-first century we are faced\r\nwith various issues, such as conflicts, poverty,\r\nrefugees, human rights violations, health, crime,\r\nterrorism and environmental degradation. Also we need\r\nto build communities in which the rights of women,\r\nchildren and various vulnerable members of society are\r\nprotected, in which they can demonstrate their talents,\r\nand in which all people can live together. In addressing\r\nsuch issues, it is increasingly important from the\r\nviewpoint of securing the existence, life and dignity of\r\neach individual to strengthen efforts that place human\r\nbeings at the centre. This is the concept of human\r\nsecurity.\r\nI would like first of all to touch upon the issue of\r\ninfectious diseases, which are not only a threat to the\r\nlife of the individual, but also a serious obstacle to\r\ndevelopment and nation-building. Japan will extend\r\nassistance to the efforts of developing countries to\r\ncombat infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria\r\nand tuberculosis. It will also actively support the\r\nactivities of non-governmental organizations in\r\ndeveloping countries working in this area.\r\nMoreover, Japan believes that the development of\r\na United Nations-centred legal framework for\r\ncombating transnational organized crime and terrorism\r\nis urgently required.\r\nEfforts to address global environmental issues are\r\nbecoming increasingly important from the viewpoint of\r\nhuman security as well. Attaching greater importance\r\nto development assistance that takes the environment\r\ninto consideration, Japan has allocated approximately\r\n40 per cent of its official development assistance to\r\nenvironmental cooperation. The primary tasks at this\r\nmoment on the environmental agenda are the success\r\nof the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange and the entry into force no later than 2002 of\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol on global warming issues.\r\nConcerning the Rio+10 event to be held in 2002,\r\nJapan believes that an agenda looking to the future\r\nshould be set, taking into account the debates on the\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\neffective implementation of many international\r\nenvironmental conventions, as well as globalization\r\nand the technological innovations that have occurred\r\nsince the Earth Summit in 1992. Mapping out strategies\r\nto implement more effectively the large number of\r\nenvironmental conventions concluded in recent years\r\nwill also be important. Japan strongly supports holding\r\nthe Rio+10 conference in Asia and welcomes\r\nIndonesias candidacy to host the conference.\r\nFurther endeavours must be made to solve the\r\nproblems confronting women, children and various\r\nvulnerable members of society. Japan highly\r\nappreciates efforts made in this regard by the United\r\nNations, including its convening in June of the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly entitled Women\r\n2000: gender equality, development and peace for the\r\ntwenty-first century. Furthermore, Japan will host the\r\nSecond World Congress against Commercial Sexual\r\nExploitation of Children, and will advance its efforts\r\nfor the protection of the rights of the child.\r\nI have touched upon only a limited part of the\r\nefforts focusing upon human security. Japan has\r\ncontributed more than 9 billion yen  well over $80\r\nmillion  to the human security fund that was\r\nestablished at the United Nations last year, and in the\r\nnear future intends to make a further contribution of\r\napproximately 10 billion yen  or roughly $100\r\nmillion  to this fund. The fund has borne fruit in\r\nassisting efforts particularly in such areas as post-\r\nconflict emergency assistance and reconstruction,\r\nhealth and medical care, and basic education. To\r\nfurther develop and deepen the concept of human\r\nsecurity and to study ways to strengthen efforts in this\r\ncontext, Japan intends to establish an international\r\ncommittee on human security, with the participation of\r\nleaders of opinion.\r\nAs I have stated, issues requiring action by the\r\ninternational community are becoming ever more\r\ndiverse and complex. We must urgently strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations system to enable it to deal with these\r\nissues.\r\nFirst of all, this requires, as a matter of urgency,\r\nthat the Security Council be re-created as a body that\r\nreflects the tremendous changes in the international\r\ncommunity. At the Millennium Summit held last week\r\nthe representatives of approximately a hundred\r\nMember States referred to this issue in their speeches\r\nwithin the limited time. The Millennium Declaration,\r\nexpressing the determination to intensify our efforts to\r\nachieve a comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, reflects the overall views of the heads of State\r\nand Government of Member States. In particular, there\r\nis a need for reform that reflects the views of\r\ndeveloping countries, which are playing an ever more\r\nimportant role in the international community, and that\r\nfosters the participation of those countries with the\r\ncapability to contribute to the solution of various issues\r\nfacing the developing countries.\r\nI believe that both the representativeness and\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council can be enhanced\r\nthrough an expansion of both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent membership, and the inclusion of both\r\ndeveloping and developed countries in the new\r\npermanent membership. Although we have already\r\nspent seven years discussing reform, during which\r\nrelevant aspects of the issue have been exhaustively\r\nexplored, we have yet to see the reform materialize.\r\nEven during the discussions, conflicts have broken out,\r\nand poverty is worsening in various parts of the world.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the time has come to\r\nseek a convergence of views among Member States on\r\nthe concrete form of Security Council reform.\r\nToday the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity requires action, not only in political and\r\nsecurity areas, but also in economic, social and various\r\nother areas.\r\nWhen the reform of the Security Council is\r\nrealized, Japan would like to assume a greater\r\nresponsibility as a permanent member of the Council,\r\nmobilizing its capabilities and its experiences in\r\nvarious areas, such as disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation, development and human security, and\r\nbased upon the ideas which I have discussed today.\r\nA prerequisite for the strengthening of United\r\nNations functions is securing a sound financial base. In\r\naddition to streamlining as well as improving the\r\nefficiency and transparency of United Nations finances,\r\nachieving a balance in financial burden-sharing is\r\nespecially important. Todays financial burden sharing\r\ncannot be considered to reflect the economic strength\r\nof respective countries or their positions and\r\nresponsibilities within the United Nations. Japan would\r\nlike to appeal for its urgent revision. I strongly hope\r\nthat an agreement can be reached on a more equitable\r\nscale of assessments for the regular budget at this\r\nsession, as an important step towards the establishment\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nof a more stable financial base. Moreover, I hope that\r\nthe substantive discussions for peacekeeping operations\r\nbudgets, which are rapidly increasing, will also be\r\nconducted during this session and that a more equitable\r\nscale of assessments for these budgets can be agreed.\r\nAs we welcome the twenty-first century, while\r\nrespecting diversity, we must transcend the differences\r\nthat arise out of our sense of belonging to an ethnic,\r\nreligious or cultural group. The foundation for these\r\nendeavours is provided by international relationships\r\nbased on universal values common to all humankind,\r\nsuch as democracy, human rights and freedom. The\r\nUnited Nations must play a central role in our efforts to\r\nconstruct such international relationships.\r\nIn order to achieve peace, we must engage in\r\ndialogue with each other in a spirit of tolerance, and\r\njoin hands in tackling various challenges. At the United\r\nNations this year is designated the International Year\r\nfor the Culture of Peace, and next year, 2001, is\r\ndesignated the United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations. These designations and the\r\nimplementation of related substantive activities reflect\r\na growing recognition of this idea.\r\nAs globalization progresses and economy-\r\noriented rationalism prevails, we should pay special\r\nattention to the task of raising awareness of cultural\r\ndiversity, nurturing the special character of respective\r\ncountries and regions, and preserving historical and\r\ncultural heritage. The United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) should\r\nplay a central role in this regard. Every country should\r\nrecognize the role of UNESCO, and join together in\r\nextending assistance to strengthen its activities.\r\nI believe that this Millennium Assembly, which\r\nbegan with the Millennium Summit, should be an\r\nepochal starting point of meaningful progress in the\r\ntwenty-first century, both in consolidating our efforts to\r\ntackle various challenges and in strengthening United\r\nNations functions through Security Council and\r\nfinancial reform. Towards that end, I should like to\r\nconclude by underscoring once again the growing\r\nimportance of cooperation among all Member States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Amre Moussa, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Egypt.\r\nMr. Moussa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It is a\r\ngreat pleasure for me to convey through you, Sir, to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly our sincere\r\ncongratulations upon his election. I am confident that\r\nhe will lead the work of this Millennium Assembly\r\nmost ably.\r\nI should also like to express our sincere\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Gurirab, the\r\nForeign Minister of Namibia, for his exceptional\r\nleadership of the fifty-fourth session.\r\nMay I also express our high esteem for the\r\nSecretary-General for his most efficient preparation for\r\nboth the Millennium Summit and Assembly. We\r\nappreciate his efforts to maintain and promote the role\r\nof the Organization and to strengthen its effectiveness\r\nand credibility.\r\nThe convening of the Millennium Summit and\r\nAssembly is an important milestone in the international\r\nsystem and the future of the United Nations. The two\r\noccasions constitute a unique forum to review the state\r\nof the world and its developments and to take stock of\r\nthe performance of the Organization so as to enable it\r\nto occupy its central place in the international system\r\nand hence lead the movement of change on the basis of\r\na general consensus and a meeting of all minds.\r\nThe goal of the establishment of a stable and\r\neffective system of collective security through dialogue\r\nand cooperation in the context of international\r\ndemocracy has been one of the most important\r\nobjectives of the United Nations and those of the\r\ninternational community. It is thus necessary to allow\r\nthe United Nations to achieve its objectives by\r\nadapting its work to the current international variables\r\nthat must take the United Nations seriously. This might\r\nvery well be the thrust of the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport to the Millennium Assembly.\r\nIn our opinion, the first step down this road is to\r\nagree on a broad modern definition of collective\r\nsecurity in the coming decades. Security in its most\r\nsimple and realistic definition is based on three basic\r\nand organically linked rights, namely, the right to\r\nsafety and stability and avoidance of the scourges of\r\nwar, mass destruction and armed conflicts, the right to\r\ndevelopment and to a decent life free from poverty,\r\ndestitution and want and the right to live in a healthy\r\nenvironment free from pollution, disease and negative\r\nsocial phenomena. A cursory glance at the state of\r\nthose three rights would reveal that during the last\r\ndecade of international transformations they have\r\nbecome exposed to new threats, while existing ones\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nhave been exacerbated in a manner threatening grave\r\nrepercussions.\r\nAfter the end of the cold war and the end of\r\ntensions between the two super-Powers, international\r\npeace became exposed to a new kind of threat, the\r\nthreat resulting from the disintegration of some States,\r\nthe collapse of their national structures and the\r\nvictimization of their people due to internal strife and\r\nnegative foreign intervention.\r\nGlobalization, world market, the information and\r\ncommunications revolution and the emergence of new\r\nkinds of economic activities all hold the promise of\r\nunlimited progress, yet they carry with them the\r\ndangers of widening the development gap between the\r\ndeveloped and developing world.\r\nAs for a healthy environment, whole continents\r\nare suffering from epidemics, environmental\r\ndegradation, backwardness and the spread of ethnic\r\nwars as well as the increased tragedies of refugees.\r\nAfrica is the region most affected by that horrible\r\ntriangle  armed civil conflicts, poverty and economic\r\nbackwardness, degraded environment, natural disasters,\r\ndeadly diseases and epidemics. There is a belt of\r\ntension encircling the continent and economic\r\ndifficulties and problems continue. Africa has thus\r\nreached an untenable situation that requires immediate\r\nand firm attention in order to help it extricate itself\r\nfrom that quagmire.\r\nI must reiterate in this regard that the African\r\nStates, through the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and other groupings, are discharging their\r\nresponsibilities as best they can. They are taking\r\nnecessary measures and steps to place themselves on\r\nthe right path towards a better future. Special mention\r\nshould be made here of the OAU Mechanism for\r\nconflict resolution, the efforts to strengthen\r\npeacekeeping capabilities through subregional\r\ngroupings and the establishment of common markets\r\nand economic groupings, such as the Common Market\r\nfor Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC)\r\nand the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS). Our continent is moving towards a form\r\nof unity on the basis of the resolutions of the recent\r\nLomé summit, which will be followed up at the\r\nupcoming Sirte summit.\r\nAn agreement was recently concluded in Arusha\r\non the settlement of the Burundi conflict. A new\r\nPresident of Somalia, Mr. Abdi Kassim Salad Hassan,\r\nwas elected after the constructive efforts of the\r\nGovernment of sisterly Djibouti. There are efforts\r\nunder way in the Great Lakes region. All these\r\nexamples prove Africas ability to deal on its own with\r\nsome of its problems. Yet it cannot be left alone\r\nwithout the support of the international community,\r\nparticularly in the field of peacekeeping and peace-\r\nmaking. The United Nations must play its full role in\r\nthat field.\r\nMeeting the new challenges faced by the\r\ninternational community and achieving the goal of\r\nestablishing an effective system of collective security\r\nfor future generations require, as I mentioned earlier,\r\nimproving the United Nations performance and\r\nadapting it to the demands of these goals. In his\r\nmessage to the Millennium Summit last week,\r\nPresident Mubarak stressed the need to pay special\r\nattention to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nto support efforts for development, poverty elimination\r\nand narrowing the widening gap between the rich and\r\nthe poor in our world.\r\nAllow me to address these priorities and to stress\r\ntheir linkage to a number of important subjects and\r\nnecessary steps. First, there is an urgent need to\r\nstrengthen and reform the United Nations in general.\r\nThere is a similar need to reform and restructure the\r\nSecurity Council and to enhance its credibility. We are\r\ndetermined to continue our contribution to the current\r\ndialogue on a comprehensive and balanced package\r\ndeal on the expansion of both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent membership of the Council. This would\r\nenable the Council to be more equitably representative.\r\nIt would also reflect the overwhelming majority of the\r\ndeveloping countries, members of the Organization.\r\nWe are fully committed to the positions of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in this regard. We reiterate the\r\nneed for expansion of the Council to be accompanied\r\nby reform of its working methods and a revision of the\r\nuse of the veto power, with a view to rationalizing it.\r\nI wish to stress here what I mentioned earlier \r\nthat Egypt has a long history of regional and\r\ninternational contributions. It plays a significant role\r\non the African, Arab and Islamic levels, as well as in\r\nthe Middle East and among the developing countries\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nand emerging economies. In addition, Egypt has made\r\nmany contributions to support United Nations activities\r\nand achieve its objectives. It has also contributed to the\r\nOrganizations peacekeeping operations. All this makes\r\nEgypt eminently eligible and qualified to shoulder the\r\nresponsibilities of permanent membership in an\r\nexpanded Security Council, within the framework\r\nsuggested by the African heads of State and\r\nGovernment since 1997.\r\nSecond, there is an equally urgent need to restore\r\nthe role of the General Assembly in the maintenance of\r\npeace, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter,\r\nespecially when the Security Council fails to discharge\r\nits primary responsibility in this regard. This would\r\nensure that any collective actions or measures enjoyed\r\nthe international legitimacy represented by the\r\nOrganization. There is a need to further develop United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations and provide them\r\nwith a rapid deployment capability. There is also a\r\nneed for concerted efforts to increase the capacity of\r\nStates, particularly African States, to participate in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, or those of\r\nregional and subregional organizations which are\r\nmandated and financed by the United Nations. Egypt\r\nwill address these important issues when the General\r\nAssembly considers the Brahimi report (A/55/305).\r\nThese considerations must be kept in mind when\r\nwe address how to develop the conceptual and practical\r\nframework of peacemaking and peacekeeping. New\r\nideas, such as humanitarian intervention and the\r\npreventive deployment of forces, have, since the last\r\nsession, begun to gain currency. We have called, and\r\ncontinue to call, for discussion of those ideas with the\r\nhighest degree of frankness and transparency. Those\r\nideas impinge on the concept of sovereignty. Some\r\ntend to belittle the value and importance of sovereignty\r\nwhen the matter pertains to the sovereignty of others.\r\nThose very same States tend also to consider it\r\nsacrosanct and inviolable when the matter pertains to\r\ntheir own sovereignty.\r\nThird, the sanctions regime, as one of the\r\ncomponent parts of the measures taken within the\r\ncurrent system of collective security, needs a thorough\r\nreview. Sanctions cannot last indefinitely. They must\r\nnot cause human suffering to tens of millions of people\r\nor result in massive and destructive harm to the\r\neconomic infrastructures or social fabric of States.\r\nSanctions must not lead to the creation of angry\r\ngenerations who will continue to be embittered by their\r\nsuffering, even after these actions are lifted.\r\nFourth, there is a need to recognize the\r\nimportance of continued, serious consideration of the\r\nquestion of disarmament, particularly nuclear\r\ndisarmament, which is the most destructive and poses\r\nthe greatest threats. The priority of nuclear\r\ndisarmament must not be overshadowed by the\r\nincreased attention paid to small arms, light weapons\r\nand anti-personnel landmines. This is not to say that we\r\ndo not recognize the importance of these subjects or\r\nthe need to deal with them comprehensively and\r\nappropriately. In this regard, we reaffirm Egypts\r\ninitiatives for the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons. We welcome\r\nthe results of the sixth Review Conference of the\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) in the field of nuclear\r\ndisarmament in general. We welcome in particular the\r\nConferences recognition of the specificity of the\r\nsituation in the Middle East and its reaffirmation of the\r\ncontinued validity and importance of implementing the\r\nresolutions on the Middle East adopted by the NPT\r\nReview and Extension Conference in 1995.\r\nFifth, with the accelerated pace of globalization\r\nand trade liberalization, the gap between the rich and\r\npoor countries is widening in a manner that threatens\r\ngrave dangers. The comparison between patterns of\r\nproduction and consumption and standards of living in\r\nthe developing and developed worlds is both stark and\r\nshocking. Narrowing this gap and correcting this\r\nimbalance in the international structure is not merely a\r\nmoral obligation, but is vital. An international\r\npartnership must be established to achieve this\r\nobjective.\r\nThe call for social justice within States must be\r\naccompanied by a similar call for justice in sharing the\r\nbenefits of progress, globalization, the information\r\ntechnology and communications revolution and trade\r\nliberalization among members of the international\r\nfamily in the North and the South alike. We truly need\r\nto give globalization a human face and an equilibrium\r\nthat will enable it to contribute to bridging that gap.\r\nUnited Nations literature is replete with studies\r\non the problems of and obstacles to development and\r\nthe elimination of poverty. This, however, is no longer\r\nsufficient. In several international conferences we have\r\nadopted plans and programmes of action containing\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nclear commitments to mobilize the financial resources\r\nnecessary to implement them. Yet implementation has\r\nnot been at the level of the commitments contained in\r\nthose documents.\r\nA few months ago we reviewed progress in the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the\r\ninternational conferences on population, women and\r\nsocial development. But what were the results of these\r\nreviews? What are the ways needed to face the\r\nobstacles that have impeded progress and made the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of those\r\nconferences fall below our expectations?\r\nWe have adopted the objective of halving poverty\r\nin the world by 2015. What is the course charted for\r\nachieving this objective and what are the commitments\r\nmade to mobilize the financial resources necessary for\r\nits achievement? What about the numerous\r\nprogrammes and initiatives for African development?\r\nHave their achievements been commensurate with the\r\nmagnitude of the problems facing the continent? Is it\r\nnot time for a clear commitment, going beyond the\r\ncurrent initiatives, to lift the burden of foreign\r\nindebtedness that is crushing Africa? We need a\r\ngenuine partnership between the North and the South.\r\nWe need real and effective support by the donors and\r\nthe international financial institutions to implement\r\ndevelopment efforts and attempts to eliminate poverty,\r\nnot only as a moral value taking the form of freedom\r\nfrom want, as mentioned in the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport (A/54/2000), but also as a vital objective\r\nconnected to the establishment of peace and stability.\r\nSixth, in the same vein, an attempt to place\r\nresponsibility for achieving development and\r\neliminating poverty solely or even primarily on the\r\nshoulders of developing countries is both dangerous\r\nand short-sighted, because it would undermine the\r\nconcept of international cooperation, which is one of\r\nthe cornerstones of the world system, and ignore the\r\nrepercussions of the widening gap between the rich and\r\nthe poor in our world. That gap is now 16 times as\r\nlarge as it was in the 1960s.\r\nAn attempt is also being made to link\r\ninternational cooperation and the Norths support for\r\nthe South with concepts and values that in themselves\r\nwe support but whose new conditionality we reject. I\r\nam referring here to democracy, good governance and\r\nhuman rights. Questions of democratic transformation,\r\nimproved governance and administration, increased\r\ntransparency and accountability, and promoting respect\r\nfor human rights cannot be dealt with in isolation from\r\nthe questions of development, poverty and subsistence,\r\nfor they too are vitally important subjects. Should not\r\nthe call for democracy within States be matched by a\r\nsimilar call for democracy among States and\r\ninternational organizations? Should not the call for the\r\nrule of law be accompanied by a similar call for respect\r\nfor international law, the sovereignty of States and the\r\nrights of peoples? Can good governance and\r\nadministration be achieved in the absence of a parallel\r\neffort for the development of human resources and the\r\ncapacity-building? Is it sufficient just to pay attention\r\nto the civil and political rights of people while ignoring\r\ntheir economic, social and cultural rights, foremost\r\namong which is the inalienable right to development?\r\nSeventh, the success of the development efforts\r\nof the peoples of the world at this stage depends on\r\ntheir efficient use of the tools of the new age,\r\nparticularly information technology. The technological\r\nrevolution has led to a widening of the gap between\r\nthose who have those tools and those who do not.\r\nNevertheless, information and knowledge technologies\r\nare of such a nature as to enable them to contribute to\r\nnarrowing the gaps between the countries of the world.\r\nThe attention Egypt pays to these global\r\nquestions does not take away from the attention it gives\r\nto regional issues that are extremely sensitive. Among\r\nthose questions, I would like to concentrate on the\r\nissues of peace in the Middle East and the situation in\r\nthe Sudan, which are of the utmost importance to Egypt\r\nand, without a doubt, to many in the Arab world,\r\nAfrica and the international community at large.\r\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict entails vital issues\r\nrelated to the lives of peoples and to the future of\r\nnations. Those include recognition of legitimate rights,\r\nsovereignty over national soil, the inalienable right to\r\nself-determination, the inadmissibility of the\r\nacquisition of territory by force and the right of all\r\nStates to live peacefully within secure borders. All\r\nthese issues are directly linked to international and\r\nregional peace and security.\r\nThe logic that must govern the peace process in\r\nthe Middle East should not stem from the assumption\r\nthat one is dealing with a permanent foe or opponent. It\r\nmust aim instead at turning past animosity into good-\r\nneighbourliness and normal relations among the\r\npeoples and the States of the region. What is at stake is\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nthe security of the region and the security and\r\nprosperity of future generations, and not short-term\r\npolitical considerations. We face a clear choice\r\nbetween either settling the issue in terms of real\r\nestate  in which one party demands metres, miles or\r\ntens of miles  thereby keeping alive the seeds of\r\ntension and conflict, or by seeking through clear\r\npolitical will to establish a just and lasting peace by\r\nwhich the rights of all parties are secured and their\r\nobligations are well defined through necessary\r\ninternational guarantees. The latter option must be\r\nbased on international law, something that applies to\r\nthe Israeli/Palestinian track and to the Syrian/Israeli\r\ntrack alike.\r\nThere is no doubt that the overwhelming majority\r\nof States, communities and individuals support the\r\nachievement of a just solution that does not favour one\r\nparty at the expense of the other. Most people would\r\nopt for peace and justice and would prefer to look\r\nahead to the future in a positive way. The\r\noverwhelming majority of the Palestinian and Israeli\r\npeople also want peace, a peace that is clear and clean\r\nand not partial, distorted or absent  something that,\r\nat the end of the day, would be more of a headache than\r\na concrete peace. In that regard, I would like to say that\r\nPresident Arafat and the Palestinian people face one of\r\ntwo choices: either no solution or a bad solution. This\r\nis a policy that will never garner support or\r\nappreciation or ever lead to a viable solution.\r\nAs to the so-called flexibility, which has been at\r\nthe forefront of commentary lately, it should mean only\r\nflexibility within the realm of international law and not\r\noutside it. If we are talking about flexibility on\r\nJerusalem, that cannot in any way mean accepting\r\nIsraeli sovereignty over Al-Haram al-Sharif. It could\r\ninstead mean arrangements for the new Palestinian\r\nState that would give it sovereignty over all its\r\nterritories while respecting the holy sites and\r\nguaranteeing their protection and free access to them.\r\nThat would assume that, as a full-fledged member of\r\nthe international community, the sovereign Palestinian\r\nState would be in charge.\r\nThe peace process is but a few miles away from\r\nthe finish line. We hope it will not take many long\r\nyears for Syria and Palestine to travel those few miles.\r\nWe also hope that the sponsors of the peace process\r\nwill be wise and able enough to propose honest\r\nsolutions to the parties in order to enable the honest\r\nbroker to lead the negotiations to a certain conclusion.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to salute President\r\nClintons enthusiasm and tireless efforts in steering the\r\npeace process during an eleventh-hour attempt to find a\r\nlasting solution during his Administration.\r\nIn order to achieve that objective it is essential to\r\nuphold one guiding principle that cannot be\r\ncircumvented, namely, full withdrawal from all Syrian\r\nand Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, in\r\nreturn for Israels right to be integrated into the Middle\r\nEast as a partner with equal rights to security, peace\r\nand cooperation. That is the essence of resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973) and of the principle of land for\r\npeace. Lasting peace and security can be established\r\nonly on that basis. If Arab territories, or any part of\r\nthose territories, remain under occupation or if any\r\nquestion is settled in a manner inconsistent with the\r\nprinciples of fairness and justice, it would create a time\r\nbomb that could explode at any time. The desired peace\r\nand security cannot be fully realized without the\r\nestablishment of a full-fledged, independent Palestinian\r\nState.\r\nThe stability of peace and security in the Middle\r\nEast is tied to the need for serious consideration of the\r\nquestion of armaments in the Middle East. Permanently\r\ndefusing tensions calls for dealing with the problem of\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\ntheir delivery vehicles. This will also contribute\r\ndirectly to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Peace and stability in the Middle East will not\r\nbe complete or lasting without the establishment of a\r\ncomprehensive regional security system that ensures\r\ncontrol over the quantity and quality of armaments in\r\nthe region and establishes a zone free from weapons of\r\nmass destruction, in accordance with President\r\nMubaraks initiative, which enjoys global\r\nunderstanding and support.\r\nThe Sudan is a State of unique character in\r\nregional relations. It is at once a major component of\r\nthe Arab world and an integral part of the African\r\ncommunity. Its stability is also vital for the security\r\nand stability of the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea and the\r\nNile basin. The importance Egypt attaches to this\r\nbrotherly country therefore stems not only from the\r\nfact that it is Egypts strategic twin, but because it is a\r\ncentral factor to the security of a vast and vitally\r\nimportant region.\r\nMany efforts have been made, and many\r\ninitiatives have been presented, to achieve peace in the\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nSudan, most of which were made in good faith.\r\nHowever, they all dealt with the situation from a single\r\nperspective, that of the southern Sudan against the\r\nnorth.\r\nConsequently, Egypt and Libya saw the need to\r\ncomplement those efforts with a comprehensive\r\nprogramme aimed at achieving broad national\r\nreconciliation encompassing all the factions and all the\r\nparties. The objective is to create a new Sudan, where\r\nstability and harmony prevail within a basic framework\r\nof unity and territorial integrity, equality among its\r\ncitizens, and consensual self-determination by all its\r\ncitizens and component parts. This will bring comfort\r\nand reassurance to the Sudanese people and to all its\r\nneighbours.\r\nThe Egyptian-Libyan initiative has gone a long\r\nway towards bringing the parties closer. The\r\ncoordination of this initiative with that of the Inter-\r\nGovernment Authority on Development (IGAD) is\r\npossible. Efforts will continue to ensure the convening\r\nof a conference on national reconciliation to achieve\r\npeace in that important country.\r\nThe achievement of peace in the Middle East, the\r\nHorn of Africa and in the continents of Asia and Africa\r\nas a whole is a necessary condition for world stability.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan, Kashmir, the Caucasus,\r\nSri Lanka, the continued tragedy of Iraq, and the\r\nconflicts in Africa and their attendant social and\r\neconomic problems all give rise to serious concerns\r\nabout the new world order  about its credibility and\r\neffectiveness. We must act quickly in order to resolve\r\nthese problems in a context of international legitimacy\r\nand within the framework of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, amid all that, the United Nations stands\r\nas an expression of the will of the international\r\ncommunity. The purposes and principles of its Charter\r\nare a guiding beacon. Let this Millennium Summit and\r\nAssembly be a new turning point that will put us on the\r\nright path towards a world of greater security, justice\r\nand stability, a world that builds upon the achievements\r\nof the twentieth century and closes the chapter on its\r\ngrave errors.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to Mr. Nguyen Dy Nien, Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Nguyen Dy Nien (Viet Nam): I would like to\r\nconvey our warm congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri\r\non his election to the presidency of this fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish also to extend\r\nour greetings to Tuvalu as a new Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThis years session of the General Assembly is of\r\nspecial significance, as it is taking place right after the\r\nMillennium Summit. The Summit marked an important\r\nmilestone for the United Nations in the discharge of the\r\nlofty responsibilities of the Organization and its\r\nMember States towards the future of humankind. The\r\nMillennium Declaration adopted by the Summit points\r\nout humanitys most pressing issues and the\r\nOrganizations primary priorities and directions at the\r\nbeginning of this new era. Thus the Millennium\r\nDeclaration can be considered a new charter and\r\nplatform of action of the United Nations.\r\nThe question now confronting the international\r\ncommunity is how to translate the Millennium\r\nDeclaration into reality. This session of the General\r\nAssembly must mark the beginning of a new awareness\r\nand determination, to be demonstrated by concrete\r\nresults. Only by so doing can we further consolidate\r\nthe confidence of the worlds people in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations, the largest Organization on our planet.\r\nThe realization of the Millennium Declaration\r\nwill be a long process, but not a simple one. It will\r\nrequire the strong determination and efforts of each\r\ncountry, the international community and the United\r\nNations, especially since globalization is having\r\nnegative effects, leading to the uneven distribution of\r\nopportunities and benefits at the expense of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nPoverty eradication and development must be\r\naccorded primary priority and supported so that we can\r\nachieve the targets set by the Millennium Summit,\r\nincluding the target to halve, by the year 2015, the\r\ncurrent proportion of the worlds poor people,\r\nendeavouring to make the right to development a\r\nreality for everyone. Among human rights, the right to\r\ndevelopment is of paramount importance. With poverty\r\nand without development, there can be no peace and\r\nstability, let alone human rights. On the other hand, the\r\nconsolidation of international peace and security will\r\nhelp to create a stable, enabling environment for\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication, in each country\r\nand each region, as well as throughout the world.\r\nTo achieve development and poverty eradication,\r\nthe first decisive requirement is for countries to\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nenhance their efforts and adopt suitable policies and\r\nprogrammes aimed at making the fullest use of their\r\nresources and potential, while at the same time fully\r\nmobilizing and effectively utilizing resources from\r\noutside. The United Nations, for its part, should\r\nstrengthen its capacity and direct the necessary\r\nresources necessary to support the poverty-eradication\r\nefforts of the Member States.\r\nAnother extremely important point is that the\r\ndeveloped and industrialized countries, as well as\r\neconomic centres, must further enhance their assistance\r\nto developing countries in their endeavour to achieve\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication. That should\r\ninclude debt-relief and write-off measures and an\r\nincrease in official development assistance to 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross domestic product, to which they have\r\ncommitted themselves.\r\nThe objectives set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration have long been considered by Viet Nam as\r\nits primary policy priorities. For example, through our\r\nown determined efforts and with the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations and other countries, we have reduced\r\nthe poverty rate, according to Viet Nams criteria, to 11\r\nper cent in 2000 from 30 per cent in 1992. We hope\r\nthat this support and assistance will be further\r\nenhanced to facilitate Viet Nams consolidation of the\r\nachievements recorded.\r\nIn the final analysis, all of these issues are aimed\r\nat serving the human being. Human resources and\r\ncultural development are two closely related aspects\r\nwithin the overall programme of development and\r\npoverty eradication. They are therefore both the goal\r\nand the driving force of development. This is the lesson\r\nthat we can draw from the experience of many decades.\r\nIt needs to be given appropriate and close attention in\r\nthe policies of all countries.\r\nThose objectives have been reflected also in\r\nVision 2020 of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) and in the Hanoi Programme of\r\nAction. They include the expansion of cooperation in\r\nSouth-East Asia and in East Asia and the building of\r\ndevelopment triangles and quadrangles crossing poor\r\nregions. Concrete examples include the promising\r\ninitiatives of the East-West corridor for development\r\nand the proclamation of the first decade of the twenty-\r\nfirst century as the Decade of Greater Mekong\r\nSubregion Development Cooperation, a proclamation\r\nwhich is supported by the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). Those\r\nprogrammes are fully compatible with the directives\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration, and they\r\nshould therefore be properly supported by the United\r\nNations and by the international community. Viet Nam\r\nand ASEAN will also contribute to further advances\r\nalong this path.\r\nIn many regions of the world, protracted conflicts\r\ncontinue, causing instability and hindering the efforts\r\nof those regions and the countries in them to eradicate\r\npoverty eradication and attain development. Viet Nam\r\nand ASEAN support the resolution of disputes by\r\npeaceful means, without interference or imposition, so\r\nas to improve and consolidate regional peace, and not\r\nto further complicate the situation and adversely affect\r\nthe confidence of the peoples of the countries\r\nconcerned in the endeavours of the international\r\ncommunity. Our common responsibility is therefore to\r\nguarantee that there will no repetition of interference of\r\nthe kind that occurred recently in violation of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and to put an end to the\r\nembargoes that have imposed untold sufferings on the\r\npeoples of Cuba and Iraq.\r\nGreater efforts should be made to further enhance\r\ndisarmament, especially disarmament relating to\r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, and to curb the growing danger of a new\r\narms race, including attempts to deploy new missile\r\nsystems.\r\nIn South-East Asia and in East Asia, the ASEAN\r\ncountries have been leading the effort to build a region\r\nof amity, cooperation and prosperity, free from nuclear\r\nweapons; to resolve outstanding issues in the region; to\r\nimplement the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in\r\nSouth-East Asia and the Treaty on the South-East Asia\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone; and to promote the\r\nASEAN Regional Forum for dialogue and cooperation\r\nwith other countries and organizations. In this field,\r\nconfidence-building measures should be enhanced on\r\nthe basis of strict respect for the principles of non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States, and\r\nof the preservation of the national and cultural identity\r\nof each country and of each region as a whole. Viet\r\nNam and ASEAN, bilaterally or through the Regional\r\nForum, will further promote efforts to develop a\r\nregional code of conduct on the South China Sea\r\nbetween ASEAN and China. We fully support the 1992\r\nASEAN Declaration on principles for resolving\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\ndisputes in the South China Sea, and we welcome\r\nrecent positive developments on the Korean peninsula.\r\nIn order to implement the new major directives of\r\nthe Millennium Summit and to follow up the\r\nmomentum created by it, the General Assembly should,\r\nat this session, further enhance the process of\r\nreforming, revitalizing and democratizing the United\r\nNations. Viet Nam supports the restoration and\r\nstrengthening of the central position of the General\r\nAssembly, an organ that represents all Member States\r\non the basis of sovereign equality. The reform of the\r\nUnited Nations  and most important, the reform of\r\nthe structure, composition and decision-making process\r\nof the Security Council  is the responsibility of all\r\nMember States.\r\nReform of the Security Council should be based\r\non the principles of the United Nations Charter. It\r\nshould ensure increased representativeness, democracy\r\nand equitable geographical distribution, through which\r\ndeveloping countries will be represented appropriately\r\nand will participate fully in the Councils decisions on\r\nimportant matters of world peace and security. Viet\r\nNam supports expansion in both categories of Council\r\nmembership, permanent and non-permanent. Regarding\r\nthe increase in the permanent membership, the general\r\npackage to be agreed upon should ensure that\r\ndeveloping countries from the three continents of Asia,\r\nAfrica and Latin America are represented; and it may\r\nalso take into account the inclusion of some developing\r\ncountries that can play a significant role and of certain\r\ndeveloped countries that have made major financial\r\nand material contributions to the United Nations. Such\r\ncountries would include India, Japan and Germany.\r\nNow more than ever before, the United Nations\r\nmust ensure that it can demonstrate the ability to\r\nreform itself and move forward with tangible steps. We\r\nneed to act, and to ensure that the reform reflects the\r\nabundant vitality of the United Nations.\r\nAs it participates in this session, Viet Nam shares\r\nthe common resolve to implement the historic\r\nMillennium Declaration to build a just and better world\r\nand a worthier and more effective United Nations.\r\nFully aware of its responsibility as a Member State\r\ntowards the United Nations and towards the\r\ninternational community, Viet Nam has for many years\r\nbeen making an effort to attain the common goals of\r\nmankind and of the United Nations, and it will\r\ncontinue to do so in the future. A very recent vivid\r\nexample was the proposal put forward by the President\r\nof the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam at the\r\nMillennium Summit, recommending that the first\r\ndecade of the twenty-first century be proclaimed a\r\ndecade of the greatest efforts towards development and\r\npoverty eradication.\r\nIn its capacity as a Member of the United Nations\r\nand as Chairman of ASEAN, Viet Nam will do its\r\nutmost to contribute actively to the development of the\r\nUnited Nations in general and of ASEAN in particular,\r\nand to promote cooperation between Viet Nam and the\r\nUnited Nations as well as between ASEAN and the\r\nUnited Nations. We wish at the same time to develop\r\nclose and effective cooperation with other Member\r\nStates and with organizations of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency The Honourable Billie\r\nMiller, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.\r\nMs. Miller (Barbados): I join other delegations in\r\ncongratulating Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland on his\r\nelection to preside over the proceedings of the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly, and on Finlands\r\nable service as Co-Chairperson of the Millennium\r\nSummit. My delegations appreciation is extended also\r\nto the outgoing President, the Foreign Minister of\r\nNamibia.\r\nI take this opportunity also to express the distinct\r\npleasure of the Government of Barbados at the fact that\r\nanother member of the fraternity of small island\r\ndeveloping States, Tuvalu, has recently taken its place\r\nat our table.\r\nFive short years ago, the United Nations\r\ncelebrated its fiftieth anniversary with a massive\r\ngathering of world leaders not much different from the\r\nevent which engaged our attention for the better part of\r\nlast week. Then as now, the report card was weighed;\r\nthen as now, amid critical assessment of its deficiencies\r\nand calls for bold reform, the Organizations continued\r\nvalidity was ultimately recognized and its unique and\r\ninherently positive role in multilateral relations\r\nemphatically supported.\r\nWe hope that this time the Millennium Summit\r\nwill have served as more than just a familiar echo\r\nreverberating, unchanged, at five-year intervals\r\nthrough these chambers, magnified among the myriad\r\nmurmurs that linger from other occasions of\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nspecialized summitry. For there is nothing inherently\r\nmagical about the passing of a millennium, or a decade,\r\nor even a quinquennium. Indeed, the proliferation of\r\nplus fives in this place is enough to confound the\r\nentire fraternity of mathematicians and accountants.\r\nAnd none of us is totally confident that the final\r\nreckoning will leave us on the plus side of the ledger.\r\nOn the contrary, it seems, sadly, that we have become\r\nconsumed by the show, not the substance; the process,\r\nnot the result; the plan, not the implementation.\r\nIn this, the last year of the second Christian\r\nmillennium, as we review the progress of the peoples\r\nof the planet over the past century, we find that, on\r\nbalance, humankind has not done very well. In many\r\nfundamental ways, the twentieth century has not lived\r\nup to the promises and expectations that an era marked\r\nby such far-reaching technological change and\r\ninnovation should have produced. In contrast, it has\r\nushered in a time of unprecedented violence and\r\nsuffering, visited mainly upon innocent civilians by\r\ninternational and internal warfare fought with\r\nincreasingly sophisticated and deadly weaponry.\r\nThe end of the ideological divide has not been\r\nfollowed by an era of peace and development, as we\r\nhad all anticipated, but by a horrendous upsurge in\r\ngenocidal, religious and ethnic conflicts. The threat of\r\nnuclear proliferation and biological warfare has only\r\npartially receded, and the scourges of terrorism, narco-\r\ntrafficking and transnational crime continue to scar\r\ninnocent lives and threaten democratic governance.\r\nWhile a few thousand souls live in obscene luxury, half\r\nof the worlds population subsist on less than two\r\ndollars a day, and millions remain desperately poor,\r\nwith no prospects of bequeathing a better life to their\r\nchildren. The new plague of the twentieth century,\r\nAIDS, continues its decimation, with disproportionate\r\neffects upon the poor in the developing world. In sum,\r\nour modern civilization has not evolved into a caring\r\nand enlightened species, but rather into one that has\r\noften abused the positive aspects of its heightened\r\ncapacity and modernization to the detriment of\r\nhumanity and of the earth.\r\nWe well know that the United Nations is not, and\r\ncannot be, the panacea for all the problems of the\r\ntwenty-first century, but we are convinced that it can\r\nand should serve as a mechanism through which the\r\nGovernments of the world, and their people, can work\r\nin common cause to find real solutions to the most\r\npressing global problems and challenges. In our\r\nincreasingly interdependent world, there is little chance\r\nof success for unilateral action. This applies equally to\r\nthe Organizations mandates for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and those for the\r\npromotion of economic development and social\r\nprogress.\r\nSince the Organizations creation in 1945, the\r\ninternational landscape has changed considerably.\r\nInternecine and intra-territorial conflicts based on\r\nreligious and ethnic differences have escalated, and the\r\nUnited Nations has seen its peacekeeping role used\r\nmore in the last decade than ever before. At the same\r\ntime, the effectiveness of that peacemaking and\r\npeacekeeping capacity has been called into question by\r\ninternational public opinion and Governments alike.\r\nWe continue to expect miracles of the United Nations\r\nin ending the bloodshed in the most troubled corners of\r\nthe world, but we seldom provide it with the tools, the\r\nfinancing and the appropriate mandate to allow for\r\ntimely and decisive action. Without this support,\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts will remain\r\nreactive, and not preventive.\r\nOne of the most complex issues currently being\r\ndebated in the context of an enhanced role for the\r\ninternational community in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security is the clash between\r\nthe opposing tenets of sovereignty and humanitarian\r\nintervention. My delegation believes that this is a\r\nmatter of such fundamental importance that it requires\r\nin-depth discussion and the elaboration, by broad-based\r\nconsensus, of clear new rules under international law.\r\nFor while we do not believe that the international\r\ncommunity can stand idly by in the face of massive and\r\ngenocidal violations of the human rights of citizens by\r\npower-hungry tyrants, we must at the same time ensure\r\nthat any international response to such situations is not\r\ninfluenced primarily by the national ambitions of third\r\nStates.\r\nDecisions must be based on clearly defined\r\ncriteria, informed by an objective verification of the\r\nfacts. Action must be confined to the saving of lives,\r\nnot the overthrowing of Governments. Humanitarian\r\nintervention, however compelling the circumstances,\r\nmust never be used as a guise for unwarranted\r\ninterference in internal State governance.\r\nThe balance sheet for the twentieth century in the\r\narea of economic and social development is similarly\r\nmixed. While the United Nations, through its\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nspecialized agencies and programmes, has made great\r\nstrides in the fight against hunger, disease and\r\ndeprivation, that progress has not been evenly\r\ndistributed. The goal of the alleviation and ultimate\r\neradication of poverty remains largely unfulfilled, with\r\ndesperate consequences for the growing numbers of the\r\nworlds population who live in extreme poverty.\r\nStructural adjustment, the errant compass of the so-\r\ncalled lost decade of the 1980s, has taken its heavy\r\nsocial toll. So, too, has the burden of debt, which,\r\ndespite the promise of debt forgiveness for the least\r\ndeveloped countries and special initiatives for the\r\nhighly indebted poor countries, continues to constrain\r\nfuture economic prospects for a large number of\r\ndeveloping countries. At the same time, the decline in\r\nofficial development assistance has had a direct impact\r\non the most vulnerable sectors of society  I refer to\r\nwomen, children, the elderly and the infirm.\r\nThe Secretary-General has challenged the\r\ninternational community to set a target for the halving\r\nof the numbers of the population living in extreme\r\npoverty by 2015. For this to be achieved, there is an\r\nurgent need for a higher level of political will and a\r\nshared commitment to create the necessary social and\r\neconomic framework to enable the poor and\r\ndispossessed to redirect their lives.\r\nEducation remains the most powerful tool for\r\nensuring social progress and the betterment of living\r\nstandards for the underprivileged. It is therefore one of\r\nthe most disappointing truths of this closing century\r\nthat the international community has failed in its\r\ncollective endeavour to eradicate illiteracy, especially\r\namong children. Although in the developing world the\r\nadult literacy rate has increased by half, from 48 per\r\ncent in 1970 to 72 per cent in 1998, the information\r\nrevolution now threatens to create a new category of\r\nfunctional illiterates. The eradication of illiteracy and\r\nthe provision of at least primary basic schooling are\r\neminently achievable goals.\r\nAs an engine of social mobility, education stands\r\nas the most important component in ensuring the\r\nsuccess of an individual and of a society. It is the\r\ngreatest social liberator and facilitator of peace and is\r\none of the fundamental pillars supporting democracy,\r\ncompetitiveness and social stability.\r\nThe development of my country, Barbados,\r\nprovides ample proof of how education can empower a\r\npeople and foster upward mobility for each succeeding\r\ngeneration. Education has always been one of the\r\nhighest priorities for the Government of Barbados and\r\na major source of budget expenditure. We are one of\r\nthe very few countries where access to education is\r\nfree at point of delivery, mandatory up to 16 years of\r\nage and universal at the primary, secondary and tertiary\r\nlevels. Currently, the Government of Barbados is\r\nembarked upon an ambitious programme within the\r\nschools known as EDUTECH 2000, which aims to\r\nensure that every child is equipped to function\r\nsuccessfully in the new information age.\r\nAs we approach the new century, the world faces\r\nprobably one of the most disastrous threats to its\r\nsustainability, a threat which has ended the lives of an\r\nunimaginable number of persons, crippled the\r\neconomies and threatened the productive workforce of\r\nsouthern Africa, and taken an increasing toll in Asia\r\nand in my own subregion, the Caribbean. I am referring\r\nto the pandemic of AIDS/HIV.\r\nCurrent estimates indicate that there are over 33.4\r\nmillion people worldwide who are now infected with\r\nthe disease. In the Caribbean region alone, that figure\r\nnumbers some 330,000, which is an astounding and\r\nfrightening statistic to contemplate for a country like\r\nBarbados, with a population of 267,000 people. Our\r\nregion has the highest prevalence per capita in the\r\nwestern hemisphere, and a prevalence second only to\r\nthat of sub-Saharan Africa. It has been reported by the\r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS) that, every day, there are 16,000 new HIV\r\ninfections and that 95 per cent of all reported AIDS\r\ncases occur in the developing world.\r\nThe AIDS pandemic is, in our view, the gravest\r\neconomic and social crisis facing the global community\r\nas we enter the twenty-first century. Many of our\r\nleaders and policy-makers are only now beginning to\r\ngrasp the enormity of the problem and to fully\r\nappreciate the devastating impact which AIDS is\r\nhaving, and will continue to have, on the economic\r\nsustainability of every country, from the smallest, most\r\nundeveloped nation to the largest, most economically\r\nviable State, because AIDS is not only a human and a\r\nsocial tragedy  it is also an economic one. It attacks\r\nour present workforce not only in its productive, but\r\nalso in its reproductive capacity, thus simultaneously\r\ndecimating the economic potential of two generations.\r\nIt is a sobering reality that AIDS is now the leading\r\ncause of death among young men in the Caribbean, and\r\nit is projected that the disease may cause a decline in\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nthe regions gross domestic product by as much as 4 to\r\n6 per cent over the next decade.\r\nWe cannot tackle this grave crisis solely on the\r\nbasis of current strategies and financial flows.\r\nContaining the spread of AIDS and dealing with its\r\neconomic impact is an immediate priority which will\r\nrequire a major commitment of human and financial\r\nresources. In this regard, I am pleased to note the\r\nserious attention now being given to the crisis by the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank\r\nand other international financial institutions. Just\r\nyesterday in Barbados, a major conference was\r\nconvened under the auspices of the World Bank,\r\nUNAIDS, the Pan American Health\r\nOrganization/WHO, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the Caribbean Community and the\r\nCanadian International Development Agency to bring\r\ntogether high-level Caribbean health, education,\r\neconomic development and labour-policy makers to\r\nmap out a new crisis strategy for the Caribbean region.\r\nBarbados applauds the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General that the United Nations should adopt\r\nas an explicit goal the reduction of HIV-infection rates\r\nin persons 15 to 24 years of age by 25 per cent within\r\nthe most affected countries before the year 2005 and by\r\n25 per cent globally by 2010. The United Nations must\r\nmake AIDS education and research a priority for the\r\ncoming century. Determined leadership is needed to\r\npersuade Governments and international\r\npharmaceutical companies that a partnership must be\r\ndeveloped to combat the disease, both through research\r\nand through the provision of drugs at reasonable cost to\r\nthose who are most in need.\r\nThe trafficking in and abuse of illegal drugs have\r\nparalysed the development of many of our societies.\r\nThey have also eroded the productivity of the work\r\nforce and led to social discord, violence and a\r\nconspicuous erosion of values and respect for the rule\r\nof law. The countries of the Caribbean have not\r\nremained untouched by this affliction, both as\r\ntranshipment and, more recently, sadly, as consuming\r\nStates.\r\nIn the fight against this menace, the United\r\nNations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) has\r\nplayed a crucial role and its subregional office in\r\nBarbados deserves special mention for its active\r\nsupport for our own efforts. In Barbados, UNDCP\r\nassistance has been invaluable in the establishment of\r\nthe Integrated Drug Programme through our domestic\r\nNational Council on Substance Abuse and also in\r\nfacilitating our community outreach efforts. Of\r\nparticular note too, has been its role in the\r\nestablishment of an Anti-Money Laundering Authority\r\nin Barbados.\r\nAs a small island developing State, Barbados is\r\nvery aware that the natural environment performs for\r\nus free basic services without which human beings\r\ncould not survive. At the same time, certain industrial\r\nand technological advances have threatened the\r\nbiodiversity of many of the small island developing\r\nStates. Therefore, for ecological reasons and for\r\nreasons of sovereignty and sustainable development,\r\nBarbados, on behalf of the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates, last year launched an initiative leading to the\r\nadoption of resolution 54/225 on promoting an\r\nintegrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea\r\narea in the context of sustainable development. We are\r\ngrateful for the recognition by the General Assembly of\r\nthe efforts of the Caribbean to protect and preserve our\r\nmost precious resource.\r\nThe functions of the Caribbean Sea are many and\r\nmulti-layered. It is the source of our food, it is the main\r\nattraction which drives our tourism markets and it is\r\nour primary and most reliable link with the outside\r\nworld. The destruction that would be caused if there\r\nwere an accident involving nuclear waste or oil in our\r\nwaters would be beyond catastrophic and it would take\r\ncenturies for our environment to fully recover. We look\r\nforward to continued assistance from the international\r\ncommunity in helping us to achieve the objectives of\r\nthat resolution to maintain and protect this, our most\r\nvital natural resource. It remains the ultimate goal of\r\nthe region to have the Caribbean Sea recognized as a\r\nspecial area within the context of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this spirit, Barbados also welcomes the newly\r\nestablished United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Ocean Affairs and intends to\r\nbe an active participant in the consultative process. We\r\nwelcome the efforts of the General Assembly to\r\naddress the problems of over-exploitation of living\r\nmarine resources and the degradation of the marine\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe collective efforts of our Governments to\r\nalleviate poverty and disease and to help our human\r\ncapital to take full advantage of the opportunities for\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\neconomic and social advancement take place within the\r\nparameters of a challenging new international order.\r\nNaturally, I refer to the phenomenon of globalization.\r\nGlobalization is not entirely new. It has existed in\r\nvarious incarnations among trading nations throughout\r\nhistory. What makes the modern incarnation different,\r\nhowever, is the manner in which the accompanying\r\ninformation revolution is making possible the\r\nintegration of trade, investment, finance, production\r\nand services across national boundaries. What also\r\ndistinguishes it is the philosophy of multilateralism,\r\nwhich offers all countries, developed and developing, a\r\nsay  at least in theory  in shaping the rules which\r\nwill henceforth govern international economic\r\ntransactions. Nor is globalization as a concept\r\ninherently negative. The precepts of expanding market\r\naccess, trade liberalization, increased technological\r\nadvancement and more efficient and effective\r\nmechanisms of manufacturing and agriculture are all\r\npositive elements. It is in the rigid application of these\r\nelements, however, and their application without regard\r\nto the social dimension of development, that distortions\r\nhave arisen which threaten to widen further the income\r\ngap between the developed and the developing worlds.\r\nI reiterate that the true challenge of the new\r\nmultilateralism will be to ensure that globalization does\r\nnot become an instrument of oppression for the peoples\r\nof the developing world, but, rather, becomes a means\r\nof offering a better life to all of our peoples.\r\nIn our efforts to sensitize the developed world to\r\nthe need for adequate transitional measures for\r\ndeveloping countries and for recognition of the special\r\nvulnerabilities of small economies, Barbados has\r\nfrequently pointed to the fact that our Caribbean\r\ncountries are being asked to undertake in 10 years a\r\nprocess which was carried out by the advanced\r\nindustrialized societies over a period of more than 40\r\nyears, spread over eight rounds of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations between 1947 and 1994. In this regard, we\r\nhave emphasized that, however clinically sound a\r\nprocedure might be, the compression of its application\r\ninto too short a time period can often be a fatal therapy.\r\nOne of the greatest essential inequalities of the\r\ncontemporary global economy is that, while the\r\ndeveloped world was allowed an extended period over\r\nwhich to properly phase in trade liberalization, to its\r\nbenefit, smaller, less endowed societies with less scope\r\nto absorb the shocks of adjustment are expected to\r\nmake a potentially beneficial adjustment over an\r\nincredibly short period of time. It would not have\r\nworked for the developed world; it will not now work\r\nfor the developing, and is in fact the consideration\r\nwhich argues the case for longer phase-in periods to\r\napply the changes in the global trading regime.\r\nBarbados is not opposed to globalization. We\r\nhave already indeed begun the process of restructuring\r\nour economy and repositioning our society to meet that\r\nchallenge. But our efforts, we believe, must be met by\r\na similar display of good faith on the part of the World\r\nTrade Organization, which must, as my Government\r\nhas repeatedly stated, review, repair and reform itself,\r\nadopt an ideology that is developmental and embrace a\r\ndevelopmental agenda that is progressive and balanced\r\nin its substance, its processes and its outcomes.\r\nThat display of good faith is also necessary in\r\npromoting constructive and mutually beneficial\r\ndialogue between the industrialized countries and their\r\ndeveloping country partners on the crucial matter of the\r\nregulation of international financial centres in their\r\njurisdictions. My country has spoken extensively in\r\nother forums about our serious concerns over the\r\nunilateral manner in which the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development has\r\nproceeded on its so-called harmful tax competition\r\ninitiative, and on the real motives underlying this\r\nunfortunate move. The setting of international rules in\r\nthe area of financial services cannot properly be done\r\nby a grouping of 29 countries to the exclusion of all\r\nother interested parties. In this age of enlightened\r\nmultilateralism there is no place for the application of\r\nunilateral, extra-territorial solutions to international\r\neconomic developments.\r\nOn balance, we must not allow our frustration at\r\nthe many missed opportunities to obscure the fact that\r\nthe twentieth century has produced much that is\r\npositive. As we look forward, in the words of the Prime\r\nMinister of Barbados, the Right Honourable Owen\r\nArthur:\r\nWe face the prospect that the simultaneous\r\noperation of the enormous power of technological\r\nchange, the dismantling of barriers to the\r\nmovement of output, capital, ideas and skills, and\r\nthe emergence of rules-based, consensus-driven\r\ninstitutions of global scope will create a new\r\nglobal society that is capable of affording\r\ndevelopment to all, and of putting the scourge of\r\npoverty behind us for ever. We will leave the\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\ntwentieth century and enter the twenty-first\r\nconscious of the dangers, but excited by the\r\nprospects.\r\nThe Acting President (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I give the floor to Her Excellency Rosario\r\nGreen, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mexico.\r\nMs. Green (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ncountry is pleased at the election of Mr. Harri Holkeri\r\nto preside over the work of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are certain that, with his talent,\r\nability and experience, the efforts of this extremely\r\nimportant Assembly session will be highly productive.\r\nMy delegation would also like to extend its recognition\r\nto Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for his outstanding work as\r\nPresident of the Assembly at the session that has just\r\nconcluded.\r\nLast Friday, during the Millennium Summit, the\r\nleader of the Mexican nation, Ernesto Zedillo, stated\r\nhis personal commitment and that of the Mexican\r\npeople to the values and principles that sustain the\r\nactivities of our Organization. Today, through me, the\r\nMexican Government renews its willingness to\r\ncontinue working and participating constructively to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations, the reason for those\r\nhistoric meetings. We will do this guided by our\r\ntraditional policy in the multilateral arena: by\r\nencouraging dialogue, consensus, and unrestricted\r\nrespect for international law. We will do this\r\nconvinced, as well, that we must make good use of this\r\nopportunity to give renewed impetus to the United\r\nNations, so that it can progress in solving the\r\nchallenges that we confront, and can fulfil the goal of\r\nbuilding, in this new century, a safer, more just and\r\nequal world for all. As the President of Mexico stated,\r\nwe will do it confident that we Mexicans have the\r\nnecessary foundation to do our share in achieving the\r\ntargets contained in the report of the Secretary-General\r\nand the Millennium Declaration.\r\nMy country is convinced that the practice of\r\ndemocracy is indispensable for the development of\r\nnations and to guarantee respect for individual\r\nfreedoms. But we are also sure that democracy is\r\nsustained by the sovereign will of its citizens and is,\r\ntherefore, a domestic process that cannot be imposed\r\nfrom the outside, although, without a doubt, it can and\r\nmust be nourished by international dialogue between\r\ncountries and by the cooperation that can be provided\r\nby the United Nations.\r\nMexico is also convinced that, just as the\r\npredominance of democracy within the membership of\r\nour Organization is imperative, it is essential that\r\nrelations between nations follow democratic practices\r\nas well, and that these, in turn, be reflected in\r\norganizations such as the United Nations that we, the\r\npeoples of the world, have created to organize our\r\ncoexistence.\r\nToday we find ourselves with an extraordinary\r\nopportunity to advance in that direction: to cover\r\nfurther ground in the democratization of our\r\nOrganization; to achieve a level of democratization that\r\nallows the United Nations to successfully fulfil the\r\nmission with which we entrusted it in San Francisco,\r\nthe validity of which we seek to renew today, a level of\r\ndemocratization that reinforces the legitimacy of our\r\nOrganization and invigorates its initiatives, a level of\r\ndemocratization that supports the domestic processes\r\nthat many of our countries are undertaking and will\r\nconsequently be enriched by them.\r\nMexico has stated on various occasions that\r\nstrengthening the General Assembly, the international\r\ncommunitys most representative universal forum, is\r\nindispensable to guarantee the full democratization of\r\nthe United Nations. We have also asserted that it is\r\nnecessary to modify the structure and operation of the\r\nSecurity Council, so that it can fully shoulder its\r\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of peace and\r\ninternational security.\r\nIt is for this reason that my country has\r\nrepeatedly proposed that we undertake a profound\r\nreform of the Security Council; a reform that is not\r\nlimited to modifications of its composition; a reform\r\nthat also considers the Councils working methods and\r\ndecision-making process; a reform that allows that\r\nimportant organ of the United Nations to reflect the\r\nplurality and diversity of our Organization; a reform\r\nthat takes into account the transformations of the\r\npolitical landscape in recent times; a reform that does\r\nnot lead to the creation of new centres of power and\r\nprivilege; a reform that regulates and limits the scope\r\nof the veto, avoiding its abuse or selective application;\r\na reform that institutionalizes the relationship between\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly so that\r\ntheir links, contacts and exchanges of information are\r\nclearly regulated; in short, a reform that guarantees that\r\nthe Security Councils decisions have the legitimacy\r\nthat can come only from the universal assent of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nBased precisely on this unwavering faith in the\r\nuniversality of international law, which Mexico fully\r\nshares, my country has engaged in its most important\r\nbattles in this world Organization. Mexico has always\r\nbeen ready to participate in codifying international law,\r\nbut we have continually insisted that progress along\r\nthis path should involve all of the countries that make\r\nup the community of nations. This is the only\r\nguarantee for preserving legality and for ensuring\r\ncordial, constructive and mutually beneficial relations\r\nbetween all of us.\r\nThe humanitarian crises in Kosovo, East Timor\r\nand Sierra Leone, to refer to only a few recent cases,\r\nhave made us reflect on the scope of and limits to\r\ncurrent international law. These crises have made us\r\nsee that it is imperative to find a balance between the\r\nurgent need to respond adequately to humanitarian\r\nemergencies and the need to respect the sovereign\r\nintegrity of all States. These crises, in short, have\r\nalerted us to the need to transform ourselves into a true\r\nassembly that analyses and proposes new paths, and\r\nthey have alerted us to what holds us back from\r\nbecoming an authentic forum where different positions\r\nare heard and where answers that realistically reflect\r\nthe possible consensuses are found.\r\nWe must therefore move forward and begin a\r\nprocess of further codifying our international law; a\r\nprocess based on the sovereign equality of States as a\r\nliving reality, not just a theoretical principle; a process\r\nin which the weak and the strong, the rich and the poor,\r\nand the small and the large can express themselves\r\nopenly. A process that clearly establishes the rules of\r\nthe game. A process that enshrines democracy as the\r\nonly way in which to reach truly legitimate agreements.\r\nBecause we believe in these democratic values,\r\nMexico has always opposed the legitimization, in\r\npractice, of any type of interference, especially when it\r\nis based on unilateral decisions or the decisions of a\r\nsmall group of countries. To the contrary, we have\r\nreiterated that the United Nations must be provided\r\nwith a modern political structure that permits it to\r\nconfront the new challenges to international peace and\r\nsecurity brought by the end of the cold war. For this\r\nreason, we have insisted on the need to begin, as soon\r\nas possible, a broad process of consultation; a process\r\nthat is absolutely democratic; a process that allows for\r\nthe discernment of the mood of our community of\r\nnations in order to respond correctly and in timely\r\nfashion to humanitarian crises without weakening the\r\nOrganization by doing so.\r\nI call upon the President of the General Assembly\r\nto formally begin, as soon as possible, this broad\r\nprocess of consultation that will allow us to reflect\r\ntogether on this issue of crucial importance for the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMexico stands ready to continue contributing to\r\nthe ongoing process of codifying international law to\r\nwhich I have referred. We will do so with the same\r\nconfidence with which, in recent years, we have\r\nadhered to a significant number of international\r\ninstruments proposed by this, our most important world\r\nOrganization. We will do so with the same will with\r\nwhich we Mexicans have committed ourselves to\r\nmodifying our national legislation in order to comply\r\nwith the obligations that derive from those instruments.\r\nSuch is our trust in international law and its\r\nadvancement.\r\nWith this trust, only a few days ago my country\r\nsigned the Statute of the International Criminal Court,\r\nas well as the Protocols to the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child. With this trust we ratified, this\r\nyear, the Convention on the Status of Refugees and its\r\nProtocol, as well as the Convention relating to the\r\nStatus of Stateless Persons.\r\nWith this trust, last week Mexico deposited its\r\nratification instrument for the Kyoto Protocol. Some\r\nmonths ago, we did the same with regard to the\r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the\r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\r\nFamilies.\r\nWith that same trust, Mexico continues its fight to\r\nachieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons and\r\ntests, and reiterates the call made last April, by the\r\ngroup of countries, including Mexico, that are part of\r\nthe new agenda for disarmament initiative, for the\r\nnuclear Powers to commit themselves to the total\r\nelimination of their nuclear arsenals.\r\nFuture generations deserve a world free of\r\nnuclear weapons. They deserve a world that is also free\r\nfrom the uncontrolled manufacture and trafficking of\r\nconventional arms. They deserve, without a doubt, a\r\nworld where anti-personnel landmines cease to claim\r\nthousands of innocent lives.\r\nOur commitment to the protection and\r\npreservation of the human race extends also to\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\ncombating the pandemics of our time. Today, a fatal\r\ndisease, AIDS, threatens to cut off the existence of\r\nmillions of beings on the planet. This is why only two\r\ndays ago, the women Secretaries and Ministers for\r\nForeign Affairs of 13 countries sent a letter to the\r\nSecretary-General in support of his call to stop and\r\nreverse the spread of AIDS by 2015 and to provide\r\nspecial assistance to children orphaned by this scourge.\r\nI want to renew the appeal of our 13 nations to all the\r\nMembers of the United Nations to support the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\r\nand to resolutely launch the common efforts that are\r\nnecessary to fight this global scourge.\r\nAs is well said in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and in the Declaration of the Millennium\r\nSummit, the protection of our common environment,\r\nthe fight against transnational organized crime, the\r\npromotion of human rights, attention to vulnerable\r\nindividuals, including children, the fight for\r\ndisarmament, and international aid to respond to the\r\ndemands of the least developed countries  these are\r\nthe foundation for allowing the people of the world to\r\nlive not only free of fear and misery, but also with\r\nhope. These are also the challenges that our\r\nOrganization and its Members must respond to, by\r\nconsolidating an international architecture that is\r\nsustained by democracy and not by the concentration of\r\npower; an international architecture based on respect\r\nfor international law, and not on unilateral decisions;\r\nan international architecture that encourages the\r\nuniversal character of our community and not selfish\r\nindividualism; in short, an international architecture\r\nthat emphasizes solidarity and cooperation as the\r\nvalues that give sustenance and permanence to the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Niels Helveg Petersen,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): Allow me first to\r\nassociate myself with the statement by my colleague,\r\nthe French Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of\r\nthe European Union. May I also congratulate you,\r\nMr. Vice-President, and through you, President\r\nHolkeri, on your election to preside over this\r\nmillennium Assembly.\r\nA few days ago, leaders from all over the world\r\ngathered at the Millennium Summit. They gathered to\r\nreaffirm their faith in the Charter and to give direction\r\nto the United Nations in the twenty-first century. The\r\nCharter remains as relevant as ever with its mandate to\r\npromote peace and security, create an international\r\ncommunity based on the rule of law, uphold respect for\r\nhuman rights and promote social development.\r\nThe new millennium brings new challenges to the\r\nUnited Nations in an ever more globalized world.\r\nIncreased communication between countries and\r\npeoples reinforces the need for common norms of\r\nsocial and economic behaviour. The global United\r\nNations conferences within the last decade bear witness\r\nto the value of the United Nations as a unique norm\r\nsetting forum. The follow up conferences to the social\r\nSummit in Copenhagen and the Beijing Conference on\r\nWomen are cases in point.\r\nThese United Nations summits have advanced our\r\nunderstanding of the interaction between peace,\r\ndevelopment and human rights. The United Nations\r\nprocess on financing for development offers an\r\nopportunity for renewed commitment and action. The\r\nrelationship between social development and\r\npromotion of human rights is today recognized. The\r\nbest preventive action against conflict and strife is to\r\nensure sound economic and social development based\r\non good governance, respect for human rights and\r\nprotection of minorities.\r\nAn encouraging and innovative feature is the\r\ndecision adopted by the Economic and Social Council\r\nin July to establish a permanent forum on indigenous\r\nissues thereby advancing the aspirations of indigenous\r\npeoples. The Danish Government and the home rule\r\nGovernment of Greenland welcome this recent\r\ndevelopment. We will actively support the work of the\r\npermanent forum.\r\nI welcome the fact that the Security Council has\r\nshown increasing attention to humanitarian issues. The\r\nopen meeting in the Council on Africa in January gave\r\nnew prominence to the humanitarian challenges for this\r\ncontinent. In the past year, the Council has taken up\r\nissues as diverse as AIDS in Africa, protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflicts and children in armed\r\nconflict. These initiatives increase our awareness of the\r\nroot causes of conflict.\r\nThe international community must shoulder its\r\nresponsibility in relation to the AIDS epidemic in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. The rapid spread of HIV/AIDS could\r\nseal the fate of more than 30 million Africans over the\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nnext five years and epidemic undermines decades of\r\ndevelopment efforts and dissolves the social texture of\r\nnations. It could destabilize entire regions. The AIDS\r\nepidemic is not a local problem. It is a matter of\r\nsecurity of global importance. Africa has enormous\r\npotential but millions continue to survive on less than\r\none dollar a day.\r\nThe growing transfer of private capital rarely\r\nflows to the countries in Africa. We must do more to\r\nintegrate Africa into the world economy. Trade\r\nopportunities must be improved. We must give free\r\naccess to the markets of industrialized countries, as\r\nwell as to products where African countries have a\r\ngenuine competitive advantage.\r\nThe legal framework of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) must take into account the special\r\ndifficulties of developing countries. Trade-related\r\ntechnical assistance must be improved.\r\nPeace and security, we know, are fundamental\r\nconditions for economic and social development. War,\r\ninternal strife and political unrest have devastated large\r\nparts of Africa, causing untold human suffering and\r\ndestruction. No one should expect easy solutions, but\r\nwe must work together to prevent and resolve armed\r\nconflicts in Africa.\r\nWe witness an increased African effort in the\r\nfield of peace and security. The international\r\ncommunity must support this trend through our active\r\ninvolvement. We must assist in capacity-building by\r\nrelevant African organizations, and by backing United\r\nNations peacekeeping efforts. Africa itself must create\r\nthe conditions for international involvement. We\r\nwelcome the initiatives by the Security Council to\r\ncreate common ground for United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations by inviting the parties\r\ninvolved to discussions and special sessions of the\r\nCouncil in New York.\r\nAlthough the Camp David talks did not bring\r\nabout an agreement in the Middle East, they\r\nrepresented a major step forward. They helped to\r\nnarrow down differences on key issues. A\r\nbreakthrough has never before seemed so close at hand.\r\nTime, however, is quickly running out. I urge the\r\nparties to seize this historic opportunity. I salute the\r\npolitical courage displayed by the Israeli and the\r\nPalestinian leadership in their efforts to achieve a\r\ndurable solution. I welcome the recent decision by the\r\nPalestinian Central Council to defer the decision on the\r\nquestion of statehood in the interest of further\r\nnegotiations.\r\nDemocracy is a peacemaker. Democracies are\r\nmuch less prone to violent conflicts. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral recently called attention to what he called fig\r\nleaf democracies. The fig leaf of elections does not by\r\nitself turn a dictatorship into a democracy. Elections\r\ncan even lead to a backlash as frustrations rise and\r\ntensions turn into violence.\r\nDenmark increasingly turns her efforts towards\r\nthe prevention and management of violent conflicts in\r\nline with our comprehensive engagement in developing\r\ncountries and active involvement in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping activities. We will strengthen this ability\r\nto react quickly and effectively.\r\nWe will also continue to support regional\r\ncooperation also when it comes to countering the\r\nuncontrolled spread of small arms. Landmines are\r\nsubstantial obstacles to development. Increased efforts\r\nby the United Nations, Governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations are necessary. Right now,\r\nnew momentum is needed. The second meeting of\r\nStates Parties to the Ottawa Convention provides an\r\nimportant opportunity.\r\nPeace operations are no longer a question of\r\nmerely keeping the warring parties apart or monitoring\r\nceasefires. They are a comprehensive and complex\r\nundertaking involving disarmament, demobilization of\r\ncombatants, supervision of elections, monitoring of\r\nhuman rights and training of local police among others.\r\nWe must enable the United Nations to adapt to the new\r\nrealities, do things better and avoid such failures as\r\nhappened in Rwanda. I fully support the\r\nrecommendations in the Brahimi Report on United\r\nNations peace operations. We must provide stronger\r\npolitical and financial support to the Organization. I\r\nwelcome the proposed shift towards the use of civilian\r\npolice and the rule of law, as I welcome the focus on\r\nrapid deployment of military and civilian personnel.\r\nPolice and judicial experts are indispensable to\r\nrebuilding the economy in civil society, and their work\r\nmust be based on a solid peace-building strategy. Close\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations is called for. We must\r\nestablish a partnership between the United Nations and\r\nregional actors.\r\nLast year the Secretary-General called upon\r\nMember States to pursue more effective policies to stop\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\norganized mass murder and violations of human rights.\r\nI fully support this view. We cannot leave large groups\r\nof people unaided where national authorities do not\r\nlive up to their responsibilities. Conflicts in Kosovo\r\nand East Timor raise serious questions with regard to\r\nsome of the classic principles of international law, the\r\nprinciple of State sovereignty, the principle of respect\r\nfor human rights and the principle of the non-use of\r\nforce in international relations. On the one hand, we\r\nhad a basic rule of international law incorporated into\r\nthe United Nations Charter  that the use of force in\r\ninternational relations is prohibited unless authorized\r\nby the Security Council or in self-defence. On the other\r\nhand, many countries find that there is a political and\r\nmoral obligation to act in the face of atrocities causing\r\nlarge-scale human suffering within another State.\r\nThere is no clear-cut solution to this dilemma.\r\nBut surely no legal principle, including sovereignty,\r\ncan be used as a shield to commit crimes against\r\nhumanity and other serious violations of human rights.\r\nThe Security Council has a moral obligation to act on\r\nbehalf of the international community. We must\r\nremember that the United Nations was founded, in the\r\nwords of the Charter, in order to reaffirm faith in\r\nfundamental human rights. Any intervention reflects a\r\nfailure of prevention. As a last resort, the international\r\ncommunity must have the ability to act in the face of\r\norganized mass murder or ethnic-cleansing, even if the\r\nSecurity Council is blocked. The challenge is to keep\r\nopen the option of humanitarian intervention without\r\nSecurity Council authorization in extreme cases, but to\r\ndo so without jeopardizing the international legal order.\r\nWe must ensure that the Security Council\r\nfunctions as effectively as possible. If not, the\r\ninfluence of the Council will be diminished. The\r\npermanent members of the Security Council should\r\napply the right of veto only in matters of vital\r\nimportance. Therefore, I reiterate my proposal to\r\nestablish a procedural rule; a rule according to which a\r\npermanent member of the Security Council would have\r\nto state the reasons why it has decided to exercise its\r\nright of veto in a given situation. Furthermore, the\r\nMember State should state on which grounds it\r\nconsiders that matters of vital importance are at stake. I\r\nhope that this idea can be further developed and that it\r\ncan gain broad support.\r\nI have addressed new challenges and possibilities\r\nat the start of the new millennium. Let me end by\r\nreminding this Assembly that old challenges still need\r\nto be addressed. Weapons of mass destruction are a\r\nlethal legacy of the cold war. They need our continued\r\nattention. Certain States are still pursuing the\r\nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nbuilding a missile capacity. There is a need for further\r\nimprovement of the international non-proliferation\r\nregimes. Peace, development and human rights have\r\nbeen the essentials in the work of the United Nations\r\nfrom the very beginning. They remain essential. The\r\nprimary responsibility for a more peaceful, prosperous\r\nand just world rests with Governments, but the United\r\nNations is here to help us. The Millennium Summit\r\nconfirmed our common will to work together as truly\r\nunited nations.\r\nI cannot leave this Assembly without expressing\r\nmy deep concern at the situation in Burma. The\r\ntreatment of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is a disgrace, and\r\nI call on the regime in Burma to immediately restore\r\nMrs. Aung San Suu Kyis freedom of speech,\r\nmovement and communication.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Youssouf Ouedraogo,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Exactly one week ago, the Millennium\r\nSummit was held in this very Hall, in which more than\r\n150 leaders, heads of State and Government took an\r\nactive and interactive part.\r\nThis Summit, which my delegation wishes to\r\nsalute once again, has played a great service in\r\nbringing together so many eminent personalities to\r\ntruly take stock of the state of the world through a stark\r\nre-reading of the mission of and the basic strategic\r\nobjectives assigned to the United Nations.\r\nWhat more can be said? How can it be better\r\nsaid?\r\nThe conclusions arrived at by our leaders, which\r\ngo to the very substance of the diverse and changing\r\nproblems that undermine humanity, frame the items\r\ninscribed on the agenda of the fifty-fifth session. They\r\nalso give us the opportunity to strike while the iron is\r\nhot and to embark immediately on their\r\nimplementation where it is possible.\r\nIn that context, the general debate in progress is a\r\nreal challenge; a challenge to stay the course, but also a\r\nchallenge to our ability to get down to basics.\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nBut before I go on, I wish to convey to the\r\nPresident, on behalf of my delegation, heartfelt warm\r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of our\r\nAssembly. This election is a well-deserved tribute to\r\nhim and his country, Finland, with which Burkina Faso\r\nenjoys an excellent relationship of friendship and\r\ncooperation.\r\nMy country is a Bureau member and we wish to\r\nassure the Bureau of our full willingness to cooperate\r\nwith it.\r\nOur congratulations also go to His Excellency\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNamibia, on the effectiveness of his guidance of the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly.\r\nI also wish to renew Burkina Fasos appreciation\r\nand support for the work of the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, who guides the work of our world\r\nOrganization with courage, lucidity and determination.\r\nThe waning millennium will no doubt forever be\r\netched in the memory of humankind. Unfortunately, it\r\nwill be etched in blood, as during it we witnessed, as\r\nvirtually powerless bystanders, the rise of slavery,\r\ncolonization and racial discrimination; the escalation of\r\nthe most atrocious kinds of war; the ongoing\r\ndegradation of the environment; and the deterioration\r\nof the terms of trade. But it will also be etched in gold,\r\nfor we witnessed prodigious scientific and\r\ntechnological progress and economic and industrial\r\ngrowth, even though the structure for sharing their\r\nfruits was slow moving and unfair.\r\nNo continent more than Africa, no people more\r\nthan Africans, bear more heavily today the stigma of\r\nthe scourges they have suffered, which will for ever\r\nmark them, or of their sharing but little  if\r\nanything  of the benefits of progress. My delegation\r\ntherefore believes that we should embrace that history\r\ntogether and in a spirit of solidarity, agree to be the\r\nliving and collective memory of it and learn its lessons\r\nso that we may strengthen our capacity to solve with\r\ngreater efficiency and equity the problems of security,\r\npeace, development and a better quality of life that\r\nmake up the core of our priorities. Whether that\r\ninvolves resolving the smouldering or open conflicts\r\nthat continue to decimate our populations and to force\r\nthem to flee by the thousands into exile, or whether it\r\nentails looking for lasting solutions to the problems of\r\nunderdevelopment, the unbearable debt burden, the\r\nAIDS pandemic, malaria or natural and environmental\r\ndisasters, we must, whatever the cost continually go\r\nback to our sources and history.\r\nI therefore make a solemn appeal to the\r\nconscience of the peoples of the United Nations to\r\nprevent hegemony and domination from being the\r\nhallmark of our Organization during the third\r\nmillennium. That would be a betrayal of this history,\r\nand make our collective memory a selective memory.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, despite the progress\r\nmade during the second millennium, there still remain\r\nquestions and concerns among developing countries,\r\nparticularly those in Africa. Their questions and\r\nconcerns are not caused solely by the acceleration and\r\nunprecedented worsening of their continued\r\nimpoverishment. Unfortunately, they also stem from\r\nthe fact that today, at the dawn of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, international relations continue to be based\r\nessentially on force. That sad fact is made worse\r\nbecause, with the end of the cold war, we are passively\r\nand almost with a resigned attitude witnessing a single\r\nmind-set developing.\r\nAs most heads of State and Government have said\r\nfrom this rostrum, the time has come to undertake the\r\nnecessary reforms at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels to build a more just, equitable,\r\nunified and fraternal world. Let us hope that the basic\r\nchallenge, I would even call it heroism, of the new\r\nmillennium will be to move forward together in\r\nsolidarity, calmly and democratically towards\r\nglobalization while we remain ourselves  that is,\r\nretain our intrinsic values and our dignity as free\r\nindividuals.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations, we are\r\nconvinced that making it more democratic is absolutely\r\nnecessary. That democratization must include a\r\nthorough reform of the decision-making processes of\r\nthe system, and of the Security Council in particular,\r\nand should go hand in hand with giving greater\r\nattention to development issues, particularly through a\r\nmore thorough examination of the idea of a\r\ndevelopment council, as proposed by the Millennium\r\nSummit. It also means making the Organization truly\r\nuniversal. In this regard, Burkina Faso welcomes the\r\nadmission of Tuvalu as the 189th Member State. We\r\nalso think it is unfair to continue to marginalize the\r\nRepublic of China, a country that meets all the\r\nrequirements of a sovereign State to take its place in\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nThroughout its history, and particularly since the\r\n1990s, Burkina Faso, learning from its own\r\nexperience  experience grounded in a culture of\r\ndialogue and negotiation  has based its contribution\r\non the quest for solutions to national and subregional\r\nconflicts on the basis of dialogue and agreement. We\r\nhave done so because we are convinced that dialogue\r\nand agreement  which are certainly not the weapons\r\nof the weak  are the only way to reach lasting peace.\r\nWe are therefore very surprised and disappointed\r\nthat for some time now my country has been forced to\r\nconfront accusations and all sorts of completely\r\nbaseless recriminations. Is this the result of a deliberate\r\ndesire to harm, or simply of misunderstanding? It is\r\nwrong and unfair that in efforts to find lasting solutions\r\nto conflicts one should yield to the easy temptation of\r\naccusation, recrimination, condemnation and exclusion.\r\nBurkina Faso has never hesitated to demonstrate its\r\ngood faith, to show its willingness to cooperate with\r\nthe United Nations and the international community, or\r\nto express its desire for transparency.\r\nThat is why we set up an inter-ministerial\r\ncommittee on Angola and Sierra Leone to follow up\r\nand monitor implementation of the sanctions decreed\r\nby the Security Council. We also invited the Council to\r\nundertake any investigations in Burkina Faso that it\r\ndeemed necessary to find the truth. Two United\r\nNations delegations therefore recently visited the\r\ncountry. Their leaders stated that they had\r\naccomplished their missions freely and peacefully.\r\nSimilarly, in the face of the recent surprising, to\r\nput it mildly, allegations by Guinea, we would like to\r\nreassure that beloved, fraternal country, as well as the\r\ninternational community, that Burkina Faso had no\r\npart, directly or indirectly, in those unfortunate events.\r\nWe repeat our readiness to welcome or support any\r\ninitiative that could shed light on this matter, which we\r\nfind profoundly distressing.\r\nAt the national level, Burkina Faso is resolutely\r\ncontinuing to consolidate and anchor the democratic\r\nprocess begun in 1990. That process is essentially\r\ncharacterized by the regular and systematic holding of\r\nelections at the municipal, legislative and presidential\r\nlevels, in objective, transparent and fair conditions\r\nrecognized by the international community; the\r\nstrengthening of public freedoms and the promotion of\r\nhuman rights; public financing of political parties,\r\nunions and an independent press; recognition of official\r\nstatus for the opposition; reform of the judicial system\r\nto allow it to play its full role in consolidating and\r\nregulating the rule of law; and strengthening\r\ndecentralization and local governance.\r\nTurning to the economy, our Government is\r\nconcentrating on a truly unified type of development.\r\nIts priorities are poverty eradication, environmental\r\nprotection, food self-sufficiency, and education and\r\nhealth for all.\r\nWe welcome the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\n(HIPC) Debt Initiative, which seeks to reduce the debt\r\nof poor, highly indebted countries, and the election of\r\nour country to that body, which strengthens our anti-\r\npoverty strategy.\r\nAt the African level, Burkina Faso has\r\nconsistently worked to strengthen good-neighbourly\r\nrelations and to promote subregional and regional\r\nintegration as well as peace and security.\r\nThat is why we are committed to the institutional\r\nstability and the strengthening of the subregional\r\ncooperation or integration organizations of which we\r\nare a member, in particular the West African Economic\r\nand Monetary Union, the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States and the Economic Community of\r\nSahel-Saharan States. We hope that the latter will be\r\naccorded the status of observer at the United Nations.\r\nFor that reason we have spared no effort to help\r\ncreate the African Union, which the African peoples so\r\nfervently desired.\r\nThese are the main ideas that Burkina Faso\r\nwanted to share with the international community and\r\nwhich attest to our unswerving commitment to the\r\nideals of the United Nations and to our unshakable\r\nfaith in our common ability together to forge a better\r\nfuture  a glorious future for the whole of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Ould Sid\r\nAhmed, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\r\nMr. Ould Sid Ahmed (Mauritania) (spoke in\r\nArabic): On behalf of the Islamic Republic of\r\nMauritania, I should like to congratulate Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri on his election to the presidency of the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that his personal qualities and his extensive\r\npolitical and diplomatic experience are an excellent\r\n36\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nguarantee of the success of this session. I should like to\r\nassure him of the full cooperation of our delegation in\r\nthis lofty task.\r\nI should like also to seize this opportunity to\r\nexpress our sincere thanks to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the outstanding way in\r\nwhich he guided the work of the previous session. I pay\r\ntribute also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nWe deeply appreciate his efforts to reform and\r\nrestructure the Organization as well as to develop its\r\nmethods of work and rationalize its role in all domains\r\nso that it meet the needs and challenges of today.\r\nIn this respect, we listened closely to the\r\nSecretary-Generals presentation of his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization. It is also my pleasure to\r\nwelcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the Organization.\r\nWe are prepared to cooperate fully with it in order to\r\nachieve the objectives of our Organization.\r\nThe reform and restructuring process of the\r\nUnited Nations bodies has become a necessity for the\r\ncommon interest. The conditions in which the United\r\nNations was founded more than 50 years ago have\r\nchanged, and major developments have taken place in\r\nall fields and at all levels, making it essential to review\r\nthe methods of work and structure of the Organization.\r\nFor that reason, we support the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council, in keeping with the principles of\r\ntransparency and justice, so as to achieve equitable\r\ngeographic representation and to reflect the\r\nuniversality of the Organization, in accordance with\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter.\r\nThis session is being held at the dawn of the third\r\nmillennium, at a time when the majority of humanity is\r\nliving in conditions that prevent them from realizing\r\ntheir aspirations. Despite some encouraging indicators\r\nin some of the third-world countries, the general trend\r\nis towards a wider gap between the industrialized\r\nworld and the developing one, which is facing major\r\nobstacles such as external debt, low prices for their\r\ncommodities, and the difficulty of accessing world\r\nmarkets.\r\nOur Organization should exert all possible efforts\r\nto alleviate the economic and social difficulties\r\nconfronting the developing countries. It must help them\r\naccelerate their development in an effective manner by\r\nincreasing official development assistance and by\r\nallowing more direct foreign investments into these\r\ncountries and the opening of the markets of the\r\ndeveloped countries to the products of developing\r\nones, all of which will contribute to the establishment\r\nof a new world order based on consensus, cooperation\r\nand solidarity among all States.\r\nThe problem of debt must also benefit from the\r\nattention and the interest of the international\r\ncommunity, because it is an obstacle to the economies\r\nof the developing countries. In this respect, my country\r\nhopes that the initiative undertaken to alleviate the debt\r\nof highly indebted and poor countries will contribute to\r\nthe solution of this problem.\r\nThe world today is facing numerous problems\r\nand challenges, the effects of which are not contained\r\nby national boundaries. They jeopardize international\r\nsecurity and undermine the achievements registered in\r\nall fields. Thus it is our duty to work relentlessly to\r\nresolve these problems. They include, to give but a few\r\nexamples, terrorism, poverty and violations of human\r\nrights.\r\nIn this respect, my country wishes to reaffirm its\r\ncondemnation of the phenomenon of terrorism, in\r\nwhatever form and whatever its origin. We call for the\r\nreinforcement of cooperation and consultation at the\r\ninternational level in order to face this phenomenon\r\nwith determination.\r\nThere is also a need to put in place policies and\r\nadopt measures to combat poverty, in order to ensure\r\nsustainable development. My country has created a\r\ncommission entrusted with combating poverty and with\r\nimplementing concrete programmes aimed at preparing\r\nour citizens to play a role in development. This\r\ncommission is also responsible for guaranteeing the\r\npromotion of individual and collective rights.\r\nIn this context, I would like to recall the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on social\r\ndevelopment, held in Geneva last June, which\r\nreaffirmed and stressed once again the Programme of\r\nAction adopted at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen in 1995.\r\nWe hope that the outcome of that special session\r\nwill contribute to an improvement in the living\r\nconditions of all people and to the attainment of\r\nsustainable development by strengthening the links\r\nbetween social issues and development.\r\nWe express our satisfaction at the outcome of last\r\nJunes special session of the General Assembly,\r\n37\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nWomen 2000: gender equality, development and peace\r\nfor the twenty-first century, and we hope it will\r\nenhance the role played by women in all spheres.\r\nThe foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of\r\nMauritania is founded on good-neighbourly relations,\r\npeaceful coexistence and strengthening regional and\r\ninternational cooperation. In line with those principles,\r\nmy country attaches great importance to consolidating\r\nstability and eliminating the causes of conflict and\r\ntension that can threaten international peace and\r\nsecurity and hamper development in many regions of\r\nthe world.\r\nTurning to the Middle East, my country, while\r\nreaffirming its support for the peace process, considers\r\nthat a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the\r\nregion can come about only on the basis of the Madrid\r\nagreements, the principle of land for peace, and the full\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973) to ensure complete Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories\r\nand from the Syrian Golan and the restoration to the\r\nPalestinian people of their legitimate national rights,\r\nforemost among them the right of self-determination\r\nand the right to the establishment of an independent\r\nState with the holy city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\r\ncapital. This requires us to intensify our efforts to\r\novercome the obstacles to peace in the region, a region\r\nthat so sorely needs a chance to realize its potential and\r\nto turn a new page in the history of its peoples. In that\r\ncontext, we note with satisfaction the Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from southern Lebanon.\r\nWe hope that efforts to bring stability and\r\nunderstanding to the Gulf region will be successful. My\r\ncountry reaffirms its respect for and adherence to\r\ninternational legitimacy, and reiterates its rejection of\r\nanything that could impinge on the independence or\r\nterritorial integrity of Kuwait, as well as its rejection of\r\nany measure that would threaten the unity or territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq. We call for an end to the embargo\r\nimposed against the Iraqi people, who have suffered\r\nimmensely from that embargo; it is children, women\r\nand the elderly who have suffered most.\r\nOn the question of the Arab Maghreb, my country\r\nis working staunchly and resolutely in cooperation with\r\nour sister countries in the Arab Maghreb Union to\r\nstrengthen cooperation and consultation to realize the\r\naspirations of the people of that region.\r\nOn Western Sahara, my country reaffirms its\r\nreadiness to make every effort to promote the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations settlement plan\r\nfor that conflict.\r\nTurning to developments in the Lockerbie crisis,\r\nwe wish to express our satisfaction at the progress\r\ntowards a comprehensive settlement, including the\r\nsuspension of the embargo imposed on Libya. We\r\nwelcome the success of the diplomatic approach, and\r\nwe hope that this problem will be resolved once and for\r\nall.\r\nWe are concerned about the ongoing conflict in\r\nSomalia, and we hope that our Somali brothers will\r\nagree to engage in constructive dialogue in a spirit of\r\nresponsibility and patriotism with a view to a peaceful\r\nsettlement and to restoring unity and national\r\nsovereignty to the country so that it can once more\r\nenjoy stability and a climate of conciliation.\r\nWe regret the continuing tension in Sierra Leone,\r\nand hope that ongoing efforts will bear fruit, so that\r\nthat country, which for nine years has been suffering in\r\na destructive war, can once again enjoy stability and a\r\nclimate of conciliation.\r\nOn the situation in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, we reaffirm our support for the Lusaka\r\nCeasefire Agreement, which in our view is the only\r\nacceptable framework for a peaceful, comprehensive\r\nand lasting solution.\r\nWith respect to Angola, my delegation reaffirms\r\nits full support for Security Council resolutions 864\r\n(1993), 1127 (1997) and 1173 (1998), and calls upon\r\nUNITA to fulfil its commitments under the Lusaka\r\nProtocol so that peace and security may return to that\r\ncountry.\r\nTurning to the conflict between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, we express our satisfaction at the ceasefire\r\nachieved thanks to the efforts of President Abelaziz\r\nBouteflika of our sister country the Peoples\r\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria. We hope that the\r\nnegotiations between the parties will result in a final\r\nsolution to that conflict.\r\nOn Kosovo, my country expresses its satisfaction\r\nat the positive developments towards ending the\r\nviolence, restoring confidence and rebuilding the\r\ncountry after many years of war.\r\n38\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nThe United Nations was established to attain the\r\ncommon purposes of all mankind, notably international\r\npeace, security and stability. The text of the Charter\r\ncontains the provisions necessary to ensure a balance\r\nbetween the rights and the duties of all those wishing\r\nto serve the common interests of international society.\r\nThat is why, at the dawn of the third millennium, we\r\nmust spare no effort to ensure the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Iaia Djaló,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and the Communities of\r\nGuinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. Djaló (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): I wish at the\r\noutset to convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri of Finland on his election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session and to\r\nreaffirm our confidence in his ability to guide our work\r\nat this session. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau, which\r\nit is my privilege to head, assures the President of its\r\nfull cooperation. Our congratulations go also to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who fulfilled his\r\nmandate in a constructive manner, thus making an\r\nimportant contribution to the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe wish also to express our trust and\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nand to thank him for the important steps that have been\r\ntaken on his initiative towards substantive reform of\r\nthe United Nations and towards bolstering the\r\nOrganizations international credibility.\r\nThe universality of the United Nations gains\r\nwhenever a new Member State is admitted. By joining\r\nthe United Nations, Tuvalu has affirmed to the\r\ninternational community that it will shoulder\r\nresponsibility for the full exercise of its sovereignty. Its\r\naccession to membership has reinforced the\r\nrepresentative nature of this world forum.\r\nIn the third millennium, with our eyes focused on\r\na new century, we are passing through a historic period\r\nin which new and significant events give rise to new\r\nhopes on the international scene.\r\nThis diagnosis, however, encompasses both hope\r\nand scepticism, for it shows that the transitional period\r\nwe are living through involves factors of both\r\nintegration and disaggregation.\r\nIf, on the one hand, the end of bipolarism that\r\ndominated international relations diminished\r\nideological antagonisms, this new and unprecedented\r\nprocess, by undoing old political and strategic\r\nbalances, is promoting democratic impulses, freeing\r\nthe energy of States and creating space for a new\r\ninternational order more in line with our times.\r\nOn the other hand, the rise of nationalist\r\naspirations, supported by the yearning for the right to\r\nfree evolution, has had the effect of triggering old\r\nconflicts, some of them forgotten in time. This\r\nphenomenon has led to an exponential growth of\r\nconflicts that menaces the internal cohesion of States as\r\nwell as international peace and security.\r\nIt was predicted, and legitimately so, that the\r\ninternational economy would be able to take advantage\r\nof the peace dividend resulting from the end of the\r\narms race. It had been expected that those resources\r\nwould be invested in the poorest countries and, thus,\r\nwould have contributed to the acceleration of global\r\neconomic growth and development. Our perception,\r\nhowever, is that, due to the present state of\r\ninternational economic relations, those optimistic\r\nexpectations have not come to fruition.\r\nAs the international balance of power has\r\nchanged, the relative position that placed different\r\ncountries in the international, political and economic\r\npecking order has also changed. The very nature of\r\nrelations among States has also been transformed.\r\nHowever, the rules and practices giving structure to a\r\nnew international order are yet to be defined. Our\r\nperception is that this is the main unresolved issue.\r\nThis calls for the community of nations, through our\r\ncommon institutions, to work determinedly together in\r\norder to bring the present transition to a successful end.\r\nTo do so, it will be essential to empower the\r\nsystem of collective security embodied in the United\r\nNations. In particular, we attach great importance to\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and the\r\nrationalization of its agenda. We also feel there is a\r\nneed to reform the Security Council so that that organ,\r\nwhich has special responsibilities, will be able to fulfil\r\nits original mission and be reborn as the main political\r\ninstrument for action in the United Nations.\r\nExpectations without precedent devolve upon the\r\nUnited Nations. We should all strive to find a solution\r\nto the present structural and financial crises faced by\r\nthe Organization. It will be necessary to reactivate its\r\n39\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\ndynamism in order to implement the Agenda for\r\nPeace and to make the Agenda for Development a\r\nreality.\r\nIt is widely known that Guinea-Bissau has just\r\novercome the gravest crisis the country has\r\nexperienced in its recent history. We are still\r\nconvalescing from the terrible effects of an absurd and\r\ndisastrous war. In addition to irreparable loss of life,\r\nGuinea-Bissau society was deeply traumatized by a\r\nconflict that almost destroyed the entire existing\r\ninfrastructure. Guinea-Bissau was made more\r\nimpoverished and more vulnerable. Its reconstruction,\r\nthe foundations of which are fragile, will be very\r\ndifficult, because even simple tasks have assumed\r\nurgent priority. The urgency and the sheer volume of\r\nthe effort needed to rebuild the country go far beyond\r\nthe limited possibilities of a Government that is near\r\nexhaustion. In order to succeed, that effort will need to\r\nbe supplemented by the effective participation of every\r\npartner of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nIn this new period of the restoration of\r\ndemocratic legality, the people of Guinea-Bissau have\r\nelected their new Government within the framework of\r\na pluralist democracy. The new National Peoples\r\nAssembly has approved a general programme of action,\r\nprepared by the Government, which defines a strategy\r\nfor sustainable development aimed at implementing the\r\npriorities identified, in cooperation with Guinea-\r\nBissaus partners. This programme of action and the\r\nproject of building a new society, required by the\r\nevolution of the situation in Guinea-Bissau, have been\r\nset out by Guinea-Bissaus new President, who was\r\nfreely elected by the people. Aware of the sacred\r\nresponsibility incumbent upon him, President Kumba\r\nYalá has committed himself to upholding the\r\nprogramme of action.\r\nAs on past occasions when we were beneficiaries\r\nof timely and precious solidarity extended by the\r\ninternational community, we are hopeful that the\r\npolitical, economic and social progress of Guinea-\r\nBissau will be further supported and maintained.\r\nAmilcar Cabral, the founder of our nation,\r\nconsidered himself and the other Guinea-Bissau\r\nfreedom fighters to be combatants for the noble causes\r\nupheld by the United Nations. Today, after the heroic\r\nstruggle that led to our independence, and thanks also\r\nto the support received from the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations, Guinea-Bissau is\r\nparticipating in the highest world diplomatic forums\r\nwith serenity and determination, embarking on an\r\nunrelenting search to improve on the heritage of our\r\nforebears.\r\nTherefore, acting with responsibility and\r\nspecificity, Guinea-Bissau has undertaken its own\r\ninitiatives, as well as presenting proposals aimed at the\r\ndefence of its interests and at contributing to the\r\nadvancement of the causes of peace and international\r\ncooperation. We recognize that in todays international\r\nsituation, rife with conflicts and contradictions, the\r\nUnited Nations remains, without a doubt, the necessary\r\nforum for the development of the activities undertaken\r\nby our Government to affirm the international presence\r\nof Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThe five African Portuguese-speaking countries,\r\njoined with Brazil, Portugal and Timor Lorosae  the\r\nlatter still being an observer  to form the Community\r\nof Portuguese-Speaking Countries. This Lusophone\r\nCommunity is characterized by solidarity and\r\ntolerance, based upon shared sentiments and\r\nperceptions rooted in a melding of cultures that\r\nexpresses the experience of our respective peoples.\r\nWe would like to salute the development in the\r\nprocesses of democratization of Government structures\r\nthat is now occurring in Sao Tome and Principe,\r\nMozambique and Cape Verde, similar to what\r\nhappened in Guinea-Bissau. This will allow our\r\nGovernments to better respond to the legitimate\r\naspirations of our peoples.\r\nWe wish to express our solidarity with the\r\nAngolan Government and people, which have\r\nexperienced the nightmare of almost 40 years of war.\r\nWe support the efforts in search of peace and national\r\nreconciliation. We strongly favour the implementation\r\nby the United Nations of the Lusaka Protocol and the\r\nfull implementation of the sanctions established by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn our West African subregion, Guinea-Bissau has\r\ntried, and to a certain extent has attained, in terms of its\r\nwill for integration, a political commitment aimed at\r\nimproving our relations with neighbouring countries so\r\nas to promote the cause of peace. In this spirit, we\r\nrecognize that in its essence the conflict of Casamance\r\nis an internal issue of Senegal. As such, we also\r\nperceive its negative consequences on the neighbouring\r\nStates. Our country is ready to work in the search for a\r\njust solution to and peaceful resolution of that conflict.\r\n40\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nWe feel, however, that we are neither a part of the\r\nproblem nor its source of origin. The constructive\r\nactions undertaken by Presidents Kumba Yalá of\r\nGuinea-Bissau and Wade of Senegal, with the support\r\nof President Jammeh of the Gambia, allow us to look\r\nwith optimism to the future evolution of that issue.\r\nWe deeply deplore the tragedy that has befallen\r\nSierra Leone, a country of our subregion. The\r\nincreased violence in that country has resulted in a\r\nhumanitarian disaster. We urge the belligerent factions\r\nand the Government of Sierra Leone to cooperate with\r\nthe international community in order to find a\r\ndefinitive solution to that fratricidal conflict.\r\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and in the Great Lakes region continues to be a\r\nsource of concern to Guinea-Bissau. It is necessary to\r\nsummon the political will of the countries of the region\r\nto diminish the tension and to continue to search for a\r\njust solution.\r\nThe Lusaka accords are the result of the\r\nperseverance of the parties involved and should be\r\nimplemented rapidly and comprehensively. They are\r\nthe essential framework for the resolution of the\r\nconflict. We are convinced that the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1291 (2000), which\r\nestablished the United Nations Organization Mission in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, represents the\r\nroad to peace.\r\nIn the Horn of Africa, Guinea-Bissau welcomes\r\nthe acceptance by Ethiopia and Eritrea of the peace\r\nplan put forward by the Organization of African Unity.\r\nWe encourage both parties to persist on the path of\r\ndialog and negotiation and to continue to cooperate\r\nwith our continental organization.\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of our continent, the\r\nMiddle East peace process is entering a decisive\r\nperiod. This process and the quest for equanimity\r\nshould be accelerated in order to ensure a lasting and\r\njust peace that respects the inalienable right of the\r\nPalestinian people to an independent State of its own,\r\nas well as the right of all States of the region, including\r\nIsrael, to national independence.\r\nFar from the African continent, Guinea-Bissau\r\ncontinues to pay special attention to the issue of East\r\nTimor. We are linked to that territory by special\r\nhistoric and cultural bonds and we are therefore closely\r\nfollowing the work of the United Nations Transitional\r\nAdministration in East Timor and the recent\r\nestablishment of a transitional Government. We hope\r\nthat the process will culminate in the full independence\r\nof Timor Lorosae and with its admission as a full\r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, we believe that the situations created by\r\nthe imposition of embargoes against certain countries,\r\nin which sanctions affect the poorer sectors of the\r\npopulations, particularly women and children, should\r\nbe addressed through dialogue and negotiation with a\r\nview to finding a definitive solution.\r\nIn the age of globalization, we should not lose\r\nsight of the human being and its vital needs. If it is\r\nlegitimate that all parties have the right to expect profit\r\nfrom progress, it is also correct that we should seek\r\neconomic growth with social equity. Mankind faces\r\nmany challenges, among which achieving\r\ncomprehensive development is without doubt the most\r\nimportant, because the lack of development is the main\r\nsource of the conflicts that lead to the crises afflicting\r\nour planet. Therefore, if we wish globalization to live\r\nup to its promise, we should learn better to work and to\r\nact together in order to correct its negative effects.\r\nIt is urgently necessary to give momentum to the\r\nNorth-South dialogue on the basis of equality and to\r\ndevelop a wide network of South-South cooperation\r\nwith a view to minimizing the risks of globalization.\r\nThat effort must be fully supported by the international\r\ncommunity with a view to a true partnership for\r\ndevelopment. Such partnership, in our view, should\r\nenable us to find the modalities of a coherent\r\ninternational action to ensure sustainable economic\r\ngrowth in the context of true development.\r\nThe structural adjustment policies adopted by the\r\nmajority of African countries are, per se, clear proof of\r\ntheir willingness to improve the management of their\r\nnational economies. Nevertheless, in most cases, the\r\nresponse of our development partners has not been in\r\nline with the sacrifices demanded and the urgency of\r\nthe problems identified. From our point of view, it is\r\nnecessary to identify the mechanisms needed to\r\npromote a true social adjustment, keeping the human\r\nindividual as its central point of reference.\r\nIn this context, the collective challenge we face is\r\nto stress a dynamic image of international solidarity,\r\nwhich may be translated into effective action for social\r\nand economic cooperation in favour of developing\r\ncountries.\r\n41\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nOur gathering here at the General Assembly\r\nrepresents the best opportunity to correct the\r\nimbalances that destabilize the global process. We need\r\nto muster the determination of all our countries in order\r\nto raise relations among States to the high level of\r\ndignity required by our shared future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for\r\nthis meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I\r\nremind members that, in accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 34/401, statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nstatement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nKuwait to the General Assembly this morning\r\ncontained a distortion of facts that requires a reply.\r\nFirst of all, concerning the issue of those missing\r\nin action, the Kuwaiti Minister attempted to politicize\r\nthe matter and to confine it exclusively to missing\r\nKuwaitis. He claimed that the Iraqi Government\r\nrefuses to participate in the meetings of the Tripartite\r\nCommission, whereas the facts of the matter are as\r\nfollows.\r\nFirst of all, the matter of the missing in action \r\nbe they Kuwaitis, Iraqis or of other nationalities  is a\r\nhumanitarian issue that should not be exploited to\r\ncheap political ends, such as that of maintaining the\r\nembargo against the Iraqi people. While Kuwait has\r\nfewer than 600 persons missing in action, Iraq has\r\nmore than 1,150, whose files are with the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross. The Kuwaiti Government\r\nis expected to submit information concerning those\r\nmissing persons. The Kuwaiti Government is called\r\nupon to put an end to the suffering of all the families\r\nthat do not know the fate of their sons, regardless of\r\ntheir nationality, for human suffering knows no\r\nnationality.\r\nSecondly, the work of the Tripartite Commission\r\nconcerning missing persons is hampered by the United\r\nStates of America and the United Kingdom, which\r\ninsist on participating in its meetings despite the fact\r\nthat they are not concerned with its work nor do they\r\nhave any missing nationals whose fate they would be\r\ninterested in learning about. However, the United\r\nStates does have one missing person, a pilot whose\r\nplane was shot down over Iraqi territories during the\r\naggression against Iraq in 1991. The United States has\r\nnot asked that the case of this missing pilot be dealt\r\nwith within the Tripartite Commission, but rather\r\nrequested to deal with it on a bilateral level under the\r\nsupervision of the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross. Once again we wish to affirm that Iraq\r\nendeavours to have the Tripartite Commission meet as\r\nsoon as possible with the participation of the parties\r\nthat do have persons missing in action  Saudi Arabia,\r\nKuwait and Iraq  under the supervision of the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross.\r\nThe Kuwaiti Minister claims that the Iraqi\r\nGovernment has not yet complied with the resolutions\r\nof the Security Council, neglecting the fact that Iraq\r\nhas indeed complied with those resolutions, whereas\r\nhis own Government has been violating those\r\nresolutions on a daily basis. All relevant United\r\nNations resolutions have called for respect for the\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of\r\nIraq. Yet ever since 1992 scores of American and\r\nBritish planes have been taking off daily from bases in\r\nKuwait and Saudi Arabia to bombard Iraqi civilian\r\ntargets, in blatant violation United Nations resolutions,\r\ninternational law and humanitarian international law.\r\nWe call upon Kuwait to end that aggressive attitude,\r\nwhich represents a serious threat to the security and\r\nstability of Iraq and the States of the region.\r\nThirdly, the Kuwaiti Minister claimed that Iraqs\r\nintentions towards Kuwait are not peaceful. But the\r\nfacts do indicate that Kuwaits intentions and actions\r\ntowards Iraq are aggressive. Kuwait chooses to ignore\r\nthe facts of history and geography and the collective\r\nopinion of the international community, including the\r\nArab States. More than one speaker has affirmed such\r\nan opinion, when the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Arab States have asked in this very Assembly that\r\nthe sanctions against Iraq be lifted in order to alleviate\r\nthe suffering of the Iraqi people. Those who prevent\r\nthe termination of the inhumane sanctions against the\r\nIraqi people are, in fact, the masters of the Kuwaiti\r\nGovernment  the Americans and the British, who are\r\ninterested in carrying out their own political\r\nprogramme without respect for international\r\nlegitimacy.\r\nMr. Flores (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation wishes to refer to the mentions made this\r\n42\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nmorning to the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and\r\nto other parts of Spanish territory in the speech that\r\nwas made to the plenary by the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco, a\r\ncountry with which Spain maintains and wishes to\r\ncontinue maintaining excellent relations based on\r\nsincere friendship, good-neighbourliness, respect and a\r\nrich shared history of which we are proud.\r\nIn underlining the excellency of our relations and\r\nthe importance that my country attaches to them, I\r\nrepeat that the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the\r\nadjacent islands are an integral part of Spanish\r\nterritory, whose citizens are represented in the Spanish\r\nParliament with exactly the same status and under the\r\nsame conditions as the rest of their compatriots.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation listened attentively to the response of the\r\nrepresentative of Iraq to the statement of the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Foreign Minister of Kuwait, and I\r\nfind it really difficult not to refute some of the\r\ncontradictions in his response. I find it necessary to\r\nclarify the facts that are already known to most\r\nMember States and further to reiterate them.\r\nFirst, regarding the issue of the Kuwaiti prisoners\r\nand detainees, Iraq has boycotted the work of the\r\nTripartite Commission, which is chaired by the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, since\r\nDecember 1998. This is not the first time Iraq has\r\nboycotted the Committees work. Regarding the\r\nparticipation of the countries of the alliance  the\r\nUnited Kingdom, the United States and France  they\r\nhave participated in the work of the Commission as a\r\nresult of an agreement concluded by the parties\r\nconcerned  Iraq, Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia  in Riyadh in 1999. The agreement spells out\r\nthe composition of the Commission and its modus\r\noperandi. Iraq is regrettably trying to pull out of that\r\nagreement and to renouncing it. Iraq is required by\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 686 (1991), 687 (1991)\r\nand 1284 (1999) to resume its participation in the\r\nworks of the Tripartite Commission and its\r\nsubcommittee and to cooperate with the high-level\r\ninternational coordinator, who was appointed by the\r\nSecretary-General in order to facilitate the solution of\r\nthis humanitarian problem.\r\nWhat Kuwait is asking for is implementation of\r\nthe Security Council resolutions and serious and\r\nconstructive cooperation to solve this problem on a\r\npurely humanitarian basis, not linked to any other\r\npolitical issues. What Iraq is doing is linking its\r\nparticipation in the Tripartite Commission to the non-\r\nparticipation of the countries of the Alliance.\r\nSecondly, regarding the missing Iraqi persons,\r\ndespite our information that Iraq has pushed this issue\r\nin order to create confusion and divert attention from\r\nthe main problem  the issue of Kuwaiti and third\r\ncountries prisoners or detainees  Kuwait has agreed,\r\nfor humanitarian reasons, to consider and study any\r\nfiles that Iraq might submit. Kuwait has also\r\ncooperated seriously with the Tripartite Commission\r\nand has expressed its readiness to receive any\r\ncommittee that might be established to visit prisons or\r\nany other places that this committee might deem\r\nsuitable inside Kuwait.\r\nThere is a specific mechanism for considering all\r\nthe files, adopted and approved by all the parties. There\r\nis also a timetable that was agreed to during the\r\nmeetings of the Tripartite Commission and its technical\r\nsubcommittee. If Iraq were keen to know the fate of the\r\nmissing Iraqi persons, why did it not attend the\r\nmeetings of the Commission?\r\nThe fact of the matter is that the issue of the Iraqi\r\nmissing persons is not mentioned in any of the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council. This is in contrast\r\nto the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees, which\r\nis an integral part of the obligations of Iraq, obligations\r\nthat Iraq is expected to fully meet.\r\nThirdly, regarding Iraqs allegations vis-à-vis\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, Kuwait is not the only\r\ncountry that says that Iraq has not fully implemented\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. The Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil, the Arab League, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, the Non-aligned Movement, and\r\nthe Security Council  all such regional and\r\ninternational organizations have called on Iraq to\r\nimplement the resolutions of the Security Council. This\r\ncan be seen in paragraph 54 of the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, from which His\r\nExcellency the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Kuwait quoted in his speech.\r\n43\r\nA/55/PV.13\r\nKuwait is not responsible for the embargo and the\r\nsanctions regime. The Security Council is the sole and\r\nonly body that has the authority to lift or maintain the\r\nsanctions. Kuwait is not a member of the Council.\r\nKuwait is a small country and does not have such\r\ninfluence on all the Council members that it can force\r\nmaintenance or extension of the sanctions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.\r\n"
