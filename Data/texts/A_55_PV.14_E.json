(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 122 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/55/345/Add.4)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat, since the issuance of documents A/55/345 and\r\nAddenda 1 to 3, Grenada and Guinea have made the\r\nnecessary payments to reduce their arrears below the\r\namount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the  General Assembly duly\r\ntakes note of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: This information will be reflected\r\nin document A/55/345/Add.4, to be issued.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nSelim El-Hoss, President of the Council of Ministers\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lebanese\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. El-Hoss (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me pleasure, Sir, to congratulate you on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fifth session. I am confident that your vast\r\nexperience and unswerving efforts will guarantee the\r\nachievement of the best results at this session.\r\nI would also like to thank your predecessor, Mr.\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia, for having wisely and\r\nsuccessfully conducted the deliberations of the fifty-\r\nfourth session. I would be remiss if I failed to express\r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, our thanks\r\nand appreciation for his efforts to preserve the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter with a view to\r\nconsolidating the prospects for peace and stability\r\naround the world.\r\nA new century has been ushered in. Our peoples\r\nand countries believe in the United Nations and in its\r\nability to embrace new visions and concepts. We have\r\nhigh hopes that a reinvigorated Organization will\r\npromote a new world order forged, in essence, by the\r\nnew forces at play. This will be a world order free from\r\nthe new power play in order to consolidate the\r\nprospects for international peace and security in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe and to meet the costs of\r\ndevelopment, which is the right of each and every\r\nindividual. This can only be accomplished if we\r\nsucceed in reactivating the central role of the United\r\nNations. The primary organs of the Organization,\r\nnamely, the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, must be entrusted with containing and\r\nchecking the dangers that face humanity and that\r\nthreaten its social and economic peace as well as its\r\nsecurity.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nI am pleased to announce that, towards the end of\r\nnext year, Lebanon will host the summit of the\r\nInternational Organization of La Francophonie to be\r\nheld in the context of the Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. Lebanons experience in coexistence, its\r\npluralistic nature and its openness to the world are, in\r\nour view, the best expression of such a dialogue.\r\nWe all agree that the United Nations is an\r\nindispensable international institution, notwithstanding\r\nits inability to settle many disputes since its inception.\r\nThe United Nations has at times been lax in enforcing\r\nits own resolutions, and at others it has been influenced\r\nby the international balance of power, which made it\r\nblind to the double standards at play. But what is\r\nindisputable is that the United Nations, with its\r\nmandates and its multifaceted world activities,\r\nconstitutes a major human achievement and tradition.\r\nWe must build upon this achievement by evincing the\r\nnecessary will to lead the world towards reconciliation\r\nwhilst maintaining the necessary balance between the\r\ncollective interests of States, large and small.\r\nOur actions must be based on the principles of\r\nsolidarity, equality and justice enshrined in the Charter.\r\nThis is of particular importance at this crucial juncture\r\nin our human existence. While vast regions of the\r\nworld are plagued by poverty, deprivation and disease,\r\nothers are enjoying a social and economic boom rarely\r\nmatched in the history of mankind. It is therefore\r\nimportant to jump start the different United Nations\r\norgans and specialized agencies, which have already\r\nimpressed us with daily records of achievement that\r\nstand as a true measure of our collective spirit of\r\nsolidarity . This solidarity must be the cornerstone of a\r\nnew humanitarian world order capable of protecting the\r\nindividual and of respecting all aspects of his rights.\r\nIn this context, we highly value the steps taken to\r\nrestructure some of the development organs of the\r\nOrganization. Such steps have introduced into their\r\nwork programmes the concept of cooperation with the\r\ninstitutions of civil society and with international\r\nfinancial institutions, the private sector and the donor\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn the second half of May this year, Lebanon and\r\nthe United Nations witnessed a historic event when my\r\ncountry recovered most of its occupied territories in the\r\nsouth and in western Bekaa. Thanks to the resistance\r\nand steadfastness of the Lebanese people and the\r\nsupport of the international community, Israel had to\r\nwithdraw from these territories after a ferocious\r\noccupation that lasted more than 22 years. It left behind\r\na trail of devastation and destruction of infrastructure,\r\nprivate property and the environment, as well as a\r\ncollapse in local production centres. Lebanon has paid\r\ndearly for its liberation. Thousands fell as martyrs on\r\nthe road to victory and thousands more were injured or\r\ndisabled.\r\nHuman and material losses were not confined to\r\nthe areas that were immediately under occupation. For\r\n30 years, the Israeli arm of aggression has stretched far\r\nto reach all Lebanese territories. Repeated Israeli\r\nstrikes terrorized our civilian population, destroyed\r\ncivilian and vital establishments and wreaked havoc on\r\nour economic and service sectors. The Israeli\r\nwithdrawal came in the wake of 22 years of continued\r\nrefusal to comply with Security Council resolutions\r\n425 (1978) and 426 (1978), which called upon Israel to\r\nwithdraw immediately and unconditionally from\r\nSouthern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the\r\ninternationally recognized borders, with strict respect\r\nfor the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political\r\nindependence of Lebanon.\r\nFor the first time since 1978, the United Nations\r\nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was allowed to\r\nfulfil its mandate under resolution 425 (1978). To do\r\nthis, the United Nations had to identify a line for the\r\npurpose of confirming the Israeli withdrawal.\r\nRegrettably, in three locations, this line did not\r\nconform to the internationally recognized boundary\r\nline demarcated in 1923 between Palestine and\r\nLebanon under the French and British Mandates. The\r\nUnited Nations border line also leaves the Shabaa\r\nfarmlands outside UNIFILs area of operation in\r\nSouthern Lebanon.\r\nLebanon has seriously cooperated with the United\r\nNations to fulfil the requirements for the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425\r\n(1978). Despite Israels repeated violations of the\r\nwithdrawal line and its obstructive practices, which\r\nhindered the deployment of the international work\r\nforce for weeks, the force was at long last able to\r\ndeploy, accompanied by the Lebanese armed forces.\r\nAt this juncture, I see it fit to recall Lebanons\r\ncivilized stance and the wisdom and tolerance\r\ngraciously shown by its valiant people after its victory\r\nand the withdrawal of the Israeli forces. Contrary to\r\ndire predictions, no mayhem or acts of vengeance\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nensued. This has earned us the appreciation and\r\nadmiration of the international community.\r\nOn this occasion, allow me to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, to his assistants and to the officers and soldiers\r\nof UNIFIL for the tireless and unswerving efforts they\r\nhave been making in fulfilment of their noble task and\r\nin compliance with the resolutions of international\r\nlegitimacy.\r\nIn this context, I would like to underline the\r\nimportance of the following points. First, Lebanon\r\ninsists that its internationally recognized borders\r\nremain intact. They are the borders demarcated in\r\naccordance with the 1923 Paulet-Newcomb maps, and\r\nreaffirmed later in the 1949 Israeli-Lebanese General\r\nArmistice Agreement. Second, Lebanon confirms its\r\nreservations on three locations on the blue line of\r\nwithdrawal adopted by the United Nations as the\r\nwithdrawal line. This reservation is included in the\r\nreport submitted by the Secretary-General to the\r\nSecurity Council on 16 June 2000.\r\nThird, Lebanon insists on its right to sovereignty\r\nover the Shabaa farmlands, which are an integral part\r\nof Lebanese territories. Fourth, Lebanon insists on its\r\nsovereignty and authority over the locations set by the\r\nUnited Nations inside the United Nations\r\nDisengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) line in the\r\nMount Hermon area.\r\nFifth, Lebanon demands the immediate release of\r\nall Lebanese detainees from Israeli prisons. They are\r\nkept as hostages in violation of the terms of the 1949\r\nFourth Geneva Convention, of the relevant Protocols\r\nand of the Hague Convention of 1907. Lebanon\r\nbelieves that the release of the detainees will be a\r\ncompletion of the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and\r\nwill therefore be a fulfilment of Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978).\r\nSixth, the liberation of Lebanese territories from\r\nIsraeli occupation shall remain compromised unless a\r\njust solution is found to the problem of Palestinian\r\nrefugees residing in Lebanon. The solution lies in\r\nallowing these refugees to return to their homeland, as\r\nprovided for in the resolutions of international\r\nlegitimacy.\r\nIsrael must compensate Lebanon for the human,\r\nmaterial and economic losses sustained as a result of\r\nIsraeli occupation and other acts of aggression, in\r\naccordance with international and customary laws and\r\nwith the principles of the United Nations Charter. In\r\nthis regard, we recall Security Council resolution 262\r\n(1968), which entitled Lebanon to appropriate redress\r\nfor the enormous destruction it suffered when Israel\r\nattacked Beiruts International Airport in late 1968. In\r\nthat attack, Israel destroyed 13 civilian Lebanese\r\naircraft. The Lebanese firmly believe in their right to\r\nreceive adequate and fair reparations for the substantial\r\nloss and devastation inflicted upon them after many\r\nlong years of occupation and repeated acts of\r\naggression. Those acts have been perpetrated by Israel\r\nsince 1978 in stark defiance of the will of the United\r\nNations.\r\nLebanon will therefore resort to the International\r\nCourt of Justice (ICJ), which is the proper organ to\r\nwhich to address its claims. We hope that the ICJ will\r\nbe able to endorse our request for adequate reparations\r\nand we appeal to the international community to\r\nsupport our just and fair demands.\r\nThe question of the reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation of the Lebanese liberated territories\r\nenjoys a high priority on the Lebanese agenda. It also\r\nenjoys tangible international support. In this context, I\r\nwould like to recall the preparatory meeting of the\r\ndonor community, held in Beirut on 27 July in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the support of the World Bank\r\nand the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. This\r\nmeeting was attended by representatives of 40 States\r\nand international financial institutions. The participants\r\ndiscussed the question of providing urgent financial\r\nassistance to help restore normalcy to the liberated\r\nterritories. The preliminary deliberations were\r\npromising and we hope to see them materialize at the\r\ndonors conference to be held at the ministerial level in\r\nOctober.\r\nThe Lebanese feel that the international\r\ncommunity did not exert adequate efforts to compel\r\nIsrael to comply with Security Council resolution 425\r\n(1978), which called upon Israel to end its occupation a\r\nlong time ago. Due to this delay, Lebanon as a whole\r\nhad to suffer the dire consequences of occupation. Our\r\nresources plummeted, our economy crumbled and our\r\npeople endured untold suffering. From this rostrum, I\r\nappeal to the donor countries, to international financial\r\ninstitutions and to the United Nations specialized\r\nagencies to provide sufficient assistance for the\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of South Lebanon.\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nThis will be a token of solidarity on behalf of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe thought that the prospects for the realization\r\nof a just and comprehensive peace in the region were\r\nreal following the recent rounds of negotiations.\r\nRegrettably, the results were disappointing. The\r\nnegotiations for peace floundered and the process was\r\nderailed on all tracks. This was due to the fact that the\r\nIsraeli leaders gave the logic of Nos precedence\r\nover the principles of right and justice. This is\r\nparticularly unfortunate in the light of the many\r\nachievements made in bringing the negotiations so\r\nclose to an optimal solution, especially on the Syrian\r\ntrack.\r\nThe prerogatives of peace are not commensurate\r\nwith the Israeli Nos. These Nos run counter to the\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy that provided for\r\nthe return to Syria of the entire Golan up to the line of\r\n4 June 1967. These resolutions also recognized the\r\nneed to enable the Palestinian people to recover their\r\ninalienable rights, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination, the establishment of their independent\r\nState on their own national soil, with Jerusalem as its\r\ncapital, and their right to return to their homeland in\r\nPalestine.\r\nThe liberation of most of the Lebanese territories\r\nfrom Israeli occupation will not affect Lebanons\r\ncommitment to the process of peaceful settlement of\r\nthe Middle East question. Lebanon upholds its position\r\nwith regard to the inseparability of the Syrian and\r\nLebanese tracks. We believe that the opportunity for a\r\njust and comprehensive peace remains, provided that\r\nIsrael complies with the resolutions of international\r\nlegitimacy and the Madrid terms of reference.\r\nLebanon believes that Israel has forfeited the\r\nachievements made in its negotiations with the Arab\r\nside due to the conflicting domestic agendas of various\r\nIsraeli political groups. This will hinder the settlement\r\nprocess in the region, and will further compromise our\r\nprotracted pursuit of peace. Lebanon calls on the co-\r\nsponsors of the peace process  the United States and\r\nthe Russian Federation  and the European Union to\r\nrenew their efforts to relaunch the peace process from\r\nthe point where it left off in 1996.\r\nLebanon cannot fail to stress once again that in\r\norder to achieve a peaceful settlement, the Palestinian\r\nrefugees, particularly those hosted by Lebanon, must\r\nbe allowed to return to their homeland. Ignoring their\r\nproblem or attempting to resettle them in Lebanon will\r\nfurther exacerbate the tension and the volatility of the\r\nregion. This would in turn threaten the prospects of a\r\njust and lasting peace.\r\nMore than 10 years have passed since the Iraqi\r\ninvasion of Kuwait. Nevertheless, the question of the\r\nrelease of the Kuwaiti detainees and prisoners of war\r\nstill awaits a solution. We in Lebanon have condemned\r\nthis invasion. We believe that, in addition to other\r\nmeasures required of Iraq, the release of prisoners will\r\nbe an important step towards improving relations with\r\nthat country. Lebanon calls for lifting the sanctions\r\nimposed on Iraq in order to alleviate the suffering of\r\nthe brotherly Iraqi people and to allow them to restore\r\ntheir security, stability and prosperity.\r\nThere is a favourable trend in the relationship\r\nbetween Iran and the Gulf States. That trend must be an\r\nincentive to settle the dispute over three islands that\r\nhas been going on between the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nand the United Arab Emirates for over three decades. It\r\nshould be settled in the context of good-\r\nneighbourliness and the common interests promoted by\r\nthe League of Arab States and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference.\r\nThe Millennium Summit was convened as part of\r\na global effort to foster the credibility of the United\r\nNations and its ability to seek solutions to the problems\r\nof all countries and peoples. The international\r\nOrganization must be capable of keeping up with the\r\ndemands and challenges of the new millennium,\r\nwhenever and wherever they arise. The deliberations of\r\nthe Millennium Summit made it clear that what was at\r\nstake was the individual. Attempts to arrive at a global\r\nvision may differ in the details, but should definitely\r\nagree on the substance. In our view, the Millennium\r\nDeclaration embodied creative ideas and principles that\r\nmust be embraced in a global blueprint and translated\r\ninto reality. Such a blueprint introduces novel\r\napproaches to the purposes and working methods of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLebanon agrees with the conclusions of the\r\nSummit. The main challenge we face today is to\r\nguarantee that the benefits of globalization are shared\r\nby all peoples of the world. The correct approach is for\r\nus to stand united so that globalization and its\r\nmanifestations and results will have a human face.\r\nAdequate controls must be developed and must take\r\ninto account the different cultures, traditions and real\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nneeds of the peoples of the world. The costs and\r\nbenefits of globalization must be fairly and equally\r\ndistributed.\r\nLebanon also believes that the protection of our\r\ncommon environment presents a different kind of\r\nchallenge. Careful strategies must be developed for\r\nwater-resource management, combating desertification,\r\nrespecting and preserving ecosystems and combating\r\nenvironmental pollution. Those strategies must be\r\ngoverned by new ethics. God has privileged Lebanon\r\nwith a scenic landscape and an optimal geographic\r\nlocation. Regrettably, we have had our share of\r\nenvironmental degradation. We therefore attach\r\nincreasing importance to environmental issues. Laws\r\nare currently being enacted for the preservation of the\r\nenvironment pursuant to the decisions of relevant\r\ninternational conferences. We need the support of the\r\ninternational community in our endeavours.\r\nDevelopment has become the main preoccupation\r\nof the developing and least developed countries. It\r\nmust be linked to an open and just global trading\r\nsystem within an institutional framework that\r\nguarantees unobstructed investment and capital flows,\r\nas well as the transfer of technology.\r\nWe must develop an international mechanism\r\nwithin the United Nations to address the indebtedness\r\nof developing countries.\r\nIn our view, there is an inherent link between the\r\nmaintenance of regional and international peace and\r\nsecurity and the process of development and peace-\r\nbuilding. Hotbeds of tension and protracted armed\r\nconflict in some regions of Africa, the Balkans and the\r\nMiddle East impede the realization of integrated\r\ndevelopment. Our international Organization must\r\ntherefore dedicate more efforts to defusing tensions and\r\nto resolving crises by reforming and invigorating the\r\nroles of its two primary organs, namely, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nIn conclusion, Lebanon is a founding Member of\r\nthe United Nations and has contributed to the drafting\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today,\r\nLebanon looks forward to playing a distinct role in the\r\nregional and international arenas. We are anxious to\r\nreconstruct and rehabilitate our vital and civil\r\ninstitutions and productive sectors after the liberation\r\nof our land from the Israeli occupation. We in Lebanon\r\nare striving for a just and comprehensive peace in the\r\nMiddle East that will bring back stability to our region\r\nand allow us to play a positive role in building a new\r\nworld in which we aspire to live.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Norway, His Excellency\r\nMr. Thorbjørn Jagland.\r\nMr. Jagland (Norway): First of all, I would like\r\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption\r\nof your important position. I would also like to\r\nwelcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nNorway is committed to a strong and effective\r\nUnited Nations. For decades, we have pursued a policy\r\nof translating our commitment to the United Nations\r\ninto substantial contributions to the various activities\r\nof the United Nations system. That is why some 60,000\r\nNorwegians have served in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. That is why Norway today\r\ncontributes 1,500 military and civilian personnel to\r\nUnited Nations and United Nations-mandated\r\npeacekeeping operations around the world. That is why\r\nwe are supporting the peace and reconciliation efforts\r\nof the United Nations in the Middle East, Colombia,\r\nCyprus and Sudan. And that is why a relatively small\r\ncountry of 4.5 million inhabitants is one of the largest\r\ndonors of voluntary contributions to the economic,\r\nsocial and humanitarian programmes of the United\r\nNations. This year, Norway is providing $1.3 billion\r\ndollars for development cooperation. My Government\r\nplans to increase that amount substantially over the\r\nnext few years. A large part of that will be channelled\r\nthrough the United Nations system.\r\nAt the first session of the General Assembly in\r\nthe twenty-first century, and after the successful\r\nMillennium Assembly last week, it is time to take stock\r\nand act upon the decisions we have made. Here is what\r\nNorway will give priority to in the time ahead.\r\nWe will focus on the root causes of conflict and\r\nput the fight against poverty, underdevelopment and\r\nenvironmental degradation at the top of our agenda.\r\nFinancing for development is essential. Norway\r\nreached the 0.7 per cent target more than 20 years ago.\r\nWe are currently devoting 0.9 per cent of our gross\r\nnational product for official development assistance,\r\nand my Government has pledged to reach a full one per\r\ncent.\r\nWe will increase our support through the\r\nmultilateral development agencies, including our\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nsupport to the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP).\r\nWe will continue to advocate a more\r\ncomprehensive approach to peace-building. Conflict\r\nprevention, humanitarian relief and long-term\r\ndevelopment cannot be regarded as separate tasks.\r\nThey must be part of an integrated and coherent\r\nstrategy of human security.\r\nWe will continue to combat malaria, tuberculosis\r\nand other diseases. Malaria alone takes two lives every\r\nminute  of every day of every year, mainly those of\r\nchildren and pregnant women. We will significantly\r\nincrease our contribution to the vaccination of children,\r\nso that they do not die of easily curable diseases.\r\nWe will intensify our efforts to help contain and\r\nreduce the spread of HIV/AIDS, which in many\r\ncountries has become the single largest threat to\r\ndevelopment. We will focus even more strongly on\r\nAfrica, as Africa needs a new and better deal. We call\r\nfor a renewed commitment to Africa and are prepared\r\nto contribute substantially to this effort.\r\nThe United Nations has mounted more peace\r\noperations during the last 10 years than during the\r\nprevious four decades combined. We have witnessed\r\nsignificant successes, but also uncovered disturbing\r\nand tragic weaknesses. Far too often  and frequently\r\nat great cost to the people we were supposed to\r\nprotect  the United Nations has relied on last-minute\r\nefforts and ad hoc arrangements. The rich and powerful\r\nMember States must honour their promises to the weak\r\nand defenceless.\r\nNorway supports the recommendations in the\r\nreport of the United Nations Panel on Peace\r\nOperations, headed by Ambassador Brahimi. We stand\r\nready to engage in a broad dialogue on how to ensure\r\nthe speedy and efficient implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Brahimi report.\r\nTogether with our partners, we will push forward\r\ntowards non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We will work for further reductions in\r\nnuclear arsenals with a view to eliminating them,\r\nbuilding on the important results of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Review\r\nConference here in New York.\r\nWe will continue to combat illicit trade and the\r\nspread of small arms. We should make full use of the\r\nopportunity provided by the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All its Aspects to take firm steps to\r\ncurtail this deadly traffic.\r\nNone of this can be done, however, if we do not\r\nsecure a sound financial basis for the United Nations\r\nitself. We must put United Nations finances on a more\r\nsecure and predictable footing. We must close the gap\r\nbetween the tasks we ask the United Nations to carry\r\nout and the resources we make available to it. Zero\r\ngrowth is clearly not sufficient. We cannot expect the\r\nUnited Nations to carry out new and additional tasks\r\nwithout additional funding.\r\nNo one must be allowed to commit war crimes or\r\ncrimes against humanity with impunity. Norway\r\ntherefore strongly supports the Statute establishing an\r\nInternational Criminal Court. Now we must seek its\r\nspeedy implementation.\r\nTo effectively meet our common challenges, we\r\nmust build new partnerships between the United\r\nNations, civil society and the private sector. The\r\nGlobal Compact is one such initiative. The Global\r\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) is\r\nanother. Early next year Norway will host an\r\ninternational conference in Oslo on the role of the\r\nprivate sector in promoting investment and economic\r\ndevelopment in the least developed countries.\r\nWe will continue to support efforts to enable\r\ndeveloping countries to take full advantage of the\r\nbenefits of multilateral cooperation. In particular, we\r\nwould like to assist the least developed countries \r\nincluding small island developing States  to benefit\r\nmore fully from joint international efforts, including\r\nthe legal regime for the seas and oceans established by\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nGlobalization provides opportunities for\r\nunprecedented growth, but it can also lead to\r\nmarginalization and isolation. In our globalized world,\r\nmarkets have become global much faster than politics.\r\nThere is an urgent need to adapt the international\r\ntrading and financial systems so that every country can\r\nobtain its fair share of the benefits of globalization.\r\nIn our shrinking world, providing humanitarian\r\naid and emergency relief to people in need is the\r\nresponsibility of every Government. Norway will\r\nincrease its humanitarian efforts  which are already\r\namong the most intensive in the world  both\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nbilaterally and through United Nations agencies and\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nWe will to the best of our ability continue to\r\nfacilitate peace efforts in countries where the parties to\r\na conflict request our involvement. Ultimately,\r\nhowever, the responsibility for lasting peace rests with\r\nthe parties themselves.\r\nFinally, we reiterate our call for reform and\r\nenlargement of the Security Council in terms of both\r\npermanent and non-permanent members. Broader\r\nmembership and increased transparency are essential to\r\nthe legitimacy and effectiveness of the Council.\r\nFor the first time since 1979, Norway is seeking a\r\nseat on the Security Council. We hope to be elected,\r\nafter 22 years, based on our contributions to the United\r\nNations and on the principles of fair rotation. We\r\ntherefore ask for the support of the Assembly. Norway\r\nwill deeply respect a mandate from the Assembly. We\r\nwill be attentive to its voices and concerns. We will\r\nremain committed to help those who suffer from\r\npoverty and war, disasters and famine to place a strong\r\nUnited Nations at the centre of world affairs, to ensure\r\nthat those who have the strongest backs bear the\r\nheaviest burden. We ask the Assembly to allow us to\r\nserve all Members.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Secretary\r\nof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Robin Cook.\r\nMr. Cook (United Kingdom): I am conscious that\r\nthe central problem for all of us when we rise to speak\r\nto the General Assembly is that there are too many\r\nissues of concern to hope to address them all in one\r\nspeech. There is no shortage of challenges to the\r\nUnited Nations as we meet for the first time in a new\r\ncentury to debate the issues of a modern world.\r\nIt is a world united by the new technologies of\r\ncommunication. We have never had so much\r\nopportunity to share the know-how for economic\r\ngrowth. Yet our world has never before been so divided\r\nbetween rich and poor. In the year ahead, we must\r\nmake sure that all the United Nations agencies and its\r\ninternational financial institutions work together in a\r\ncoordinated way to promote development and to reduce\r\ndebt.\r\nIt is also a world bound together by growth in\r\ntrade between our countries. But we failed at Seattle to\r\nmake further progress on removing the obstacles to that\r\ntrade. In the year ahead, we must launch a world trade\r\ndevelopment round which is fair to those countries\r\nwhose main exports are agricultural rather than\r\nindustrial.\r\nIt is a world which faces a common threat to its\r\nglobal climate. We are each learning the alarming rate\r\nat which that climate is changing as the result of our\r\nown actions. Before the end of the year, we must try to\r\nreach agreement at the sixth Conference of the Parties\r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change to bring into effect the Kyoto\r\nmeasures to stabilize climate change.\r\nEach of these is an important challenge. Each of\r\nthem is a strategic priority for our work programme for\r\nthe coming year. This morning, though, I wish to focus\r\nmy remarks on the central theme of the Millennium\r\nSummit and of this fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nHow do we equip the United Nations with the\r\ncapacity in peacekeeping that matches the real\r\ndemands for it around our world?\r\nIn his opening address, the Secretary-General\r\ninvited us to give a swift response to the Brahimi\r\nreport on peacekeeping (A/55/305). The United\r\nKingdom is happy to respond to that invitation by\r\noffering our support for the reports conclusions and\r\npledging our commitment to its implementation. The\r\nreport begins by reminding us that the United Nations\r\nwas founded, in the words of its Charter, to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. Too\r\noften, though, we have failed to save those who needed\r\nour protection from the suffering, the pain and the\r\nterror of brutal conflict. We must be frank in facing up\r\nto those failures if we are to learn their lessons. And\r\nwe must be determined to improve the capacity of this\r\nOrganization to keep the peace if we are to succeed in\r\nthe future.\r\nI want to set out six tasks which we must address\r\nif we are not to repeat past failures. First, we must\r\nequip the United Nations with a more effective and\r\nmore rapid capacity for peacekeeping. In the space of\r\nabout one year, the number of troops on United Nations\r\npeacekeeping missions around the globe has trebled.\r\nThe United Kingdom has forces operating in eight\r\ndifferent theatres where peacekeeping has been\r\nauthorized by the United Nations.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nBut it is not the new size of our peacekeeping\r\neffort that demands changes. It is the different\r\ncharacter of the peacekeeping challenge. It used to be\r\nthe case that United Nations forces were typically\r\ndeployed to observe a ceasefire between two States\r\nboth of which wanted to end the fighting. Today, our\r\npeacekeepers are typically deployed within States, not\r\nbetween them, and often where one or more parties to\r\nthe conflict is not seriously committed to peace. In\r\nthose circumstances, United Nations peacekeepers need\r\na robust mandate. As the Brahimi report puts it, where\r\none side is violating a peace agreement, treating both\r\nsides equally can amount to complicity with evil.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeepers who witness violence\r\nagainst civilians should be presumed to be mandated to\r\nhalt it.\r\nBut if those peacekeepers are to act with\r\ndetermination, then we must equip them with the\r\ncapacity to do so. The United Nations needs a\r\nHeadquarters unit capable of rapid deployment within a\r\nfew weeks, not a few months, of a Security Council\r\nresolution. And each of us must develop the number of\r\ntroops who are trained in the principles and practice of\r\npeacekeeping whom we can commit to the United\r\nNations. That is why the United Kingdom has proposed\r\na permanent staff college for United Nations\r\npeacekeeping. The United Kingdom has offered to host\r\nsuch a resource for United Nations peacekeeping, if\r\nthat is welcome to other members of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe second task is to be more rapid and more\r\nimaginative in tackling tension before it results in\r\nconflict. By definition, any mission to restore peace is\r\nan admission of failure to prevent conflict. As well as\r\ncoping with the consequences of conflict, we need to\r\naddress the root causes of conflict: poverty, bad\r\ngovernance and the denial of freedom or of minority\r\nrights. I welcome the Secretary-Generals intention to\r\nsubmit a report on conflict prevention early next year.\r\nIt will be a natural companion to the Brahimi report. I\r\nhope it can enable us to develop an early warning\r\nsystem which will alert us to potential conflict and give\r\nour agencies the chance to offer help before it becomes\r\na real conflict.\r\nToo often, internal conflict is fuelled by the\r\nexternal demand for the illicit trade in diamonds or the\r\nevil trade in drugs. Measures to ban conflict diamonds\r\nfrom international sale or to defeat the drugs barons\r\nmust be key elements of any comprehensive strategy of\r\nconflict prevention.\r\nThe third task is to take tighter control of the\r\nflows of arms which supply conflict. As an\r\ninternational community, we have put much effort into\r\ncontrolling weapons of mass destruction. The good\r\nprogress we all made at the Review Conference of the\r\nStates Parties to the Treaty on the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) underlines the\r\nimportance which each of us attaches to this strategic\r\nissue. The United Kingdom has ratified the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, has reduced\r\nby half its planned strategic nuclear warheads, and has\r\nsupplied greater transparency on our nuclear arsenal.\r\nYet, over the past decade, the true weapons of\r\nmass destruction have been small arms, which have\r\nkilled 5 million people in conflicts around the globe.\r\nOverwhelmingly, those killed were civilians rather than\r\nsoldiers. And, overwhelmingly, they were killed in\r\ncountries which do not manufacture firearms. We must\r\nmake a success next year of the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in all its Aspects. We need to reach\r\nagreement to mark firearms at the point of production\r\nso that they can be traced. The United Kingdom would\r\nsupport at that conference the presumption that military\r\nfirearms should not be licensed for sale other than to\r\nlegitimate Government bodies. And we must seek the\r\nhelp of the international economic agencies, including\r\nthe World Bank, to fund and to reward with\r\ndevelopment aid the surrender of firearms.\r\nThe fourth task is to provide the United Nations\r\nwith the civilian resources to promote reconciliation\r\nand reconstruction. In Kosovo, and again now in East\r\nTimor, we have learned that the end of conflict is only\r\nthe starting point. When the troops have brought peace,\r\nwe need judges and administrators to bring justice and\r\ndevelopment. The peacekeepers must be followed by\r\npeace-builders. In particular, we need to muster the\r\ncivilian police who can establish law and order in place\r\nof violence and conflict. I was astonished to read in the\r\nBrahimi report that this mighty international\r\norganization has only nine civilian police on its\r\nHeadquarters staff, administering 8,600 civilian police\r\nin the field around the world. I am confident that every\r\none of them is the very best, in keeping with the\r\ntradition of United Nations staff. But if we are serious\r\nabout succeeding on the ground, we need a more\r\nserious back-up at the centre. Four times in the past\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\ndecade, the United Nations has been called upon to\r\nundertake a transitional civilian administration. We\r\nneed a better, permanent, capacity here at the centre to\r\nsupport our operations in the field.\r\nThe fifth task is to enforce the international law\r\non crimes against humanity. If we are to have\r\ninternational justice, we must have an international\r\ncourt. The United Kingdom has given strong support to\r\nthe International Criminal Court, and we have just\r\npublished our draft legislation to ratify the treaty\r\nsetting up such a Court. The International Criminal\r\nCourt will send a strong warning to any future tyrants\r\nthat they will be called to account for their crimes\r\nbefore the bar of international justice. It will be one of\r\nthe most powerful advances for human rights since we\r\nagreed 50 years ago to the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nAnd finally, we must strengthen the authority of\r\nthe United Nations. In 50 years, there has been no new\r\npermanent member of the Security Council. The\r\nSecurity Council needs to represent the world as it is in\r\nthis century, not the world as it was in the middle of the\r\nlast century. It needs to be made representative of the\r\n100 or more countries that have joined as Members\r\nsince the Security Council was set up. The United\r\nKingdom supports a doubling of the permanent\r\nmembership to include Germany, Japan and three\r\ncountries from each of the continents of Asia, Africa\r\nand Latin America. We also want more members\r\namong those who are elected, in order that the Security\r\nCouncil can be more representative of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFor seven years, we have been debating this\r\nquestion. It is becoming an issue of credibility for the\r\nUnited Nations. How can we pretend to end conflict if\r\nwe cannot end this disagreement among ourselves? A\r\nmore representative, modern Security Council would\r\nspeak with more authority when it challenges those\r\nwho breach the peace.\r\nI have been frank about where we must improve\r\nour capacity for peacekeeping and strengthen our will\r\nto halt conflict. But we should not underrate the\r\nimmense achievement of the United Nations. Our\r\nCharter begins by recalling the untold sorrow to\r\nmankind inflicted by two world wars. It was a Charter\r\nwritten by ministers and officials determined to end\r\nwar between States. And in this they were remarkably\r\nsuccessful. External aggression between States is now\r\nunusual.\r\nBut the benefits have been unevenly shared. The\r\nindustrialized nations have enjoyed half a century of\r\npeace. That has provided the security and good order in\r\nwhich their prosperity has advanced at a rate without\r\nprecedent in history. Yet, in the same half century,\r\npeople elsewhere in the globe have lived through\r\nviolence and conflict which have broken their human\r\nrights and impoverished their standards of living. It is\r\nlargely poor countries that now experience the scourge\r\nof war which our Charter sought to banish.\r\nThe challenge for the United Nations is to ensure\r\nthat the peace and security which have been enjoyed by\r\nmany Member States are shared by all. None of us can\r\nprevent humanitarian catastrophe by acting alone. But\r\nthis United Nations can, if we act together.\r\nThe Brahimi report tells us what we need to do.\r\nAs an organization, we publish many reports. Nobody\r\ncould fault the capacity of the United Nations to\r\nproduce reports. But we are not always as good at\r\nimplementing them. Let us make sure that the Brahimi\r\nreport does not gather dust on library shelves but is put\r\ninto practice before we meet again next year. Let us\r\nshow the determination and the conviction that the\r\nright in our Charter to be preserved from war is an\r\nequal right for the people of all our nations, large and\r\nsmall, rich and poor.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdurrahman Shalghem, the Secretary\r\nof the General Peoples Committee for Foreign Liaison\r\nand International Cooperation of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya.\r\nMr. Shalghem (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): It gives me great pleasure, Sir, to extend to\r\nyou, on behalf of my countrys delegation, our\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of this\r\nsession, and to wish you every success in the\r\nmanagement of its affairs. I would also like to express\r\nour appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, who\r\nadministered the work of the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly most competently. I wish also to\r\nseize this opportunity to express our gratitude to\r\nSecretary General Kofi Annan for his initiatives, which\r\nhave been instrumental in putting an end to tension in\r\nmany parts of the world and for his endeavours aimed\r\nat reform of the United Nations and the enhancement\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nof its role, so that it may better fulfil its duties,\r\naccording to the Charter. A word of welcome is also\r\ndue to the Republic of Tuvalu, which joined us a few\r\ndays ago as a new member of the United Nations.\r\nThis session is convened in the aftermath of\r\nseveral developments. In the past few days, the\r\nSecretary-General submitted Comprehensive report on\r\npeacekeeping operations; it included a number of\r\nrecommendations that would assist the United Nations\r\nin assuming its responsibilities in this field.\r\nFurthermore, over the last few months, the General\r\nAssembly convened two special sessions, the first\r\nconducted a review of the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World\r\nConference on Women, and the second reviewed\r\nprogress in the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and beyond.\r\nLast week, this hall witnessed the convening of the\r\nMillennium Assembly, at the conclusion of which the\r\nleaders of the world expressed their adherence to the\r\nUnited Nations and renewed their commitment to the\r\npurposes and principles of its Charter, as well as their\r\nintent to lend it their support and to enhance its role to\r\nenable it to cope with the new century, with all its\r\nchanges and challenges. In our view, these\r\ndevelopments will undoubtedly contribute to the efforts\r\naimed at achieving the goals of this Organization.\r\nHowever, it must also be noted that we are still far\r\nfrom achieving the ultimate goal for which we strive \r\nnamely, the establishment of a world that enjoys peace,\r\nsecurity, freedom, equality, and justice, a world free\r\nfrom oppression, acts of aggression, and attempts to\r\nimpose hegemony and domination.\r\nThere are many regions in the world today that\r\nsuffer from wars and conflicts. Famine and diseases\r\nsuch as cancer, malaria, and acquired immune\r\ndeficiency syndrome (AIDS) still threaten the lives of\r\nmillions. Resources provided by nature for the\r\nsustenance of life are being seriously endangered.\r\nDeveloping countries have not benefited from the\r\nadvantages of globalization in a manner proportional to\r\ntheir suffering from its negative impact. In fact,\r\ninternational financial institutions have started to\r\nimpose severe conditions on these countries to the\r\nextent that they find themselves at the mercy of a new\r\nform of colonialism. Attempts to intervene in the\r\ninternal affairs of other States have threatened to\r\neliminate sovereignty  not only to violate it.\r\nThere are also unilateral boycott policies and\r\nimposition of unjust sanctions, even aggression, under\r\nthe pretext of so-called international legitimacy. Old\r\nideological barriers have been replaced by new barriers\r\nthat obstruct the States of the South from access to\r\ntechnology they desperately need for development, and\r\nthat impose trade protection measures on their products\r\nby making other markets inaccessible to them. We are\r\nalso witnessing selectivity in the sphere of\r\ndisarmament and double standard policies in the\r\ntreatment of international issues. Furthermore, criminal\r\nactivities have increased, including illicit drug\r\ntrafficking, the financing of organized crime and all\r\nkinds of transnational crimes.\r\nSuch is the current state of the world, with its\r\nvarious variables and challenges, after the collapse of\r\ninternational equilibrium. Such a state of affairs\r\nnecessitates the adoption of certain measures to combat\r\nand rectify the prevailing conditions. The United\r\nNations, in its capacity as an instrument and reference\r\nauthority for all, should perform a pivotal role in\r\ndealing with these variables. However, we believe that\r\nthe Organization will not be capable of making an\r\neffective contribution in this respect unless radical\r\nreforms are introduced into the composition of its\r\norgans and the working mechanisms of its entities. In\r\norder to guarantee success for this process, we should\r\nmake it a comprehensive one that takes into account\r\nthe aspirations, ideas, and proposals of all Member\r\nStates, big and small, strong and weak. The\r\nresponsibility for success or failure of this process\r\nmust ultimately be a joint responsibility.\r\nMy country, wishing to contribute to the ongoing\r\nefforts aimed at reforming the United Nations, believes\r\nthat the required reform should achieve the following\r\nobjectives: first, strengthening the role of the General\r\nAssembly so that it becomes the authority responsible\r\nfor determining and deciding the conditions that must\r\nbe deemed truly threatening to international peace and\r\nsecurity. A mechanism answerable to the General\r\nAssembly should be established to ensure the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions and to enable it to\r\ncontrol and hold accountable other United Nations\r\norgans, including the Security Council, which itself\r\nshould be an executive entity for the implementation of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions.\r\nSecondly, restructuring the Security Council so\r\nthat it achieves fair geographical representation in its\r\nmembership, with equity for African, Asian, and Latin\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nAmerican States that are not fairly represented in the\r\nmembership of the Council.\r\nThirdly, improving the ways and methods by\r\nwhich the Security Council conducts its work so that\r\nits activities are rendered more transparent. Its rules of\r\nprocedures should also be reviewed. In fact, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which represents all the Member\r\nStates of the Organization, should issue such rules;\r\notherwise, it would be meaningless to say that the\r\nCouncil acts on behalf of the international community.\r\nFourthly, we urge the abolition of the\r\nprerogatives that the victors of the Second World War\r\ngranted to themselves, particularly the right of veto,\r\nwhich should be eliminated because it is non-\r\ndemocratic and undermines the principle of the full\r\nequality of Member States, as enshrined in the Charter.\r\nFifthly, in order to enable the Organization to\r\nfollow up on its plans and programmes, we propose the\r\nestablishment of an international committee answerable\r\nto the United Nations, with subcommittees that cover\r\nmost regions of the world, empowered with the\r\nnecessary mandates and resources to undertake the\r\ntasks of inspecting and implementing United Nations\r\nprogrammes.\r\nDespite the problems suffered by many African\r\ncountries, the current year has witnessed some\r\nencouraging developments. In Somalia, Parliament was\r\nable to choose a new President for the country and the\r\ndisputing parties in Burundi signed a national\r\nreconciliation agreement. The fighting that broke out\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea has been contained and\r\nboth sides have signed a ceasefire agreement. These\r\nsolutions were the fruits of efforts made by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and a number of\r\nAfrican leaders who sincerely care for the security,\r\nstability and development of the continent. For its part,\r\nmy country has contributed to all these efforts and will\r\npursue, in cooperation with the OAU and the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, our initiatives\r\naimed at securing a just settlement acceptable to all\r\nparties to the conflict in Sierra Leone. We will also\r\ncontinue our good offices with the aim of finding a\r\nsolution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo and the Great Lakes region on the basis of the\r\nimplementation of the Sirte agreement, which was\r\ncompleted in Lusaka, for the purpose of ending the\r\ndispute in that region.\r\nFrom the outset, we in Libya have realized that\r\nAfricas problems are partly due to its disunity and the\r\nfragmentation of its own peoples efforts. Therefore, in\r\norder for the continent to be truly capable of facing the\r\nchallenge of disputes, disease and backwardness, as\r\nwell as others imposed by new international situations,\r\nBrother Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi, the leader of\r\nthe revolution, has pursued his efforts to unify the\r\ncontinent so that it may be ushered into the new\r\ncentury strong and unified. It was in this spirit that a\r\nmeeting of African foreign ministers was held in\r\nTripoli last April, at which the founding law for the\r\nAfrican Union was drafted. This law was approved in\r\nLomé last June at the Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment. At the invitation of the leader of the\r\nrevolution, the African presidents will meet in Sirte\r\nearly next year to declare the official establishment of\r\nthe African Union. This bears witness to the fact that\r\nAfrica has overcome the negative aspects of the past\r\nand realized the dream of unity, which has been the\r\naspiration of African peoples for decades.\r\nAll these initiatives and endeavours provide new\r\nevidence that Africa fully realizes that the solution to\r\nits problems and the advancement of its capacities\r\nreside basically in the efforts of its own sons and\r\ndaughters. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that\r\ninternational peace is indivisible and that international\r\nstability cannot be achieved partially. This means that\r\nthe international community has an obligation to assist\r\nAfrica in its efforts to realize peace and stability on its\r\nsoil. As we reiterate today our invitation to all States to\r\nhelp Africa in developing a programme to eliminate\r\nepidemics and diseases, provide a solution to the\r\nproblem of its external debt and ensure that the\r\ncontinent is dealt with on new, just and equitable terms,\r\nrather than be considered merely as a consumer market\r\nfor the products of the industrialized world, we wish to\r\nrecall, as we have always done, that Africas problems\r\nlie in the abuse of its resources, the plundering of its\r\nwealth and riches, intervention in its internal affairs\r\nand the imposition of foreign concepts alien to its\r\ntraditions and culture. We demand that such practices\r\nbe discontinued, as they constitute one of the main\r\nreasons for political instability in many parts of the\r\ncontinent and for economic backwardness in most. We\r\nalso call upon the States that colonized Africa, drew its\r\nborders and scattered and enslaved its people to offer\r\ntheir apologies to the continent and to fully compensate\r\nit for all the damage inflicted by colonialism.\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nNo solution has yet been found to the Palestinian\r\nquestion because the essence of this problem has been\r\nignored. My country emphasizes once again that there\r\nis no solution to the Palestinian problem other than the\r\nreturn of the Palestinian people to their homeland and\r\nthe establishment of their State on the land of\r\nPalestine, with Jerusalem as its capital. On this\r\noccasion, as we salute the people of Lebanon who,\r\nthanks to their steadfastness, were able to defeat the\r\nenemy and liberate their occupied land, we once again\r\nstress the need for an end to the occupation of the\r\nSyrian Golan Heights. We also demand the immediate\r\nlifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq and call upon\r\nthe international community to put an end to the human\r\ntragedy endured by that countrys people, to preserve\r\nthe unity and integrity of its territories, to respect its\r\nsovereignty, to refrain from interfering in its internal\r\naffairs and to cease the military aggression waged daily\r\nagainst it.\r\nThe international community has made\r\ncontinuous efforts in the field of disarmament. My\r\ncountry, which is a party to most international\r\nconventions in this area, is still fully convinced that\r\nsome international conventions addressing certain\r\naspects in this field should be reviewed. I would refer,\r\nas one example, to the Ottawa Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, which deals only with simple weapons of\r\nlimited effect. We, as one of the third world peoples\r\nwho are incapable of defending our borders and lands\r\nagainst the powerful who possess aircraft carriers and\r\naircraft that refuel in flight, feel that humanity should\r\nbe preoccupied with the destruction of nuclear,\r\nchemical and biological weapons, as well as with\r\nballistic weapons, rather concern itself with mines,\r\nwhich are a simple form of weaponry.\r\nOn the other hand, we have noticed that a number\r\nof obstacles still hinder the efforts to establish a world\r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction. Those who\r\npossess nuclear arms have not yet undertaken actual\r\nmeasures to dispose of their nuclear arsenals. In fact,\r\nsome of them have continued to develop these weapons\r\nvertically, instead of beginning to destroy them. The\r\nIsraelis, who possess hundreds of nuclear warheads\r\nwith which they threaten the Arab people from the\r\nAtlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf, still refuse to join\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and to place their nuclear installations under\r\nthe supervision and the safeguards system of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nIn raising this most serious and momentous\r\nsubject, we are fully convinced that, unless the\r\ninternational community adopts effective measures to\r\nforce the Israelis to accept and implement the\r\ninternational conventions on nuclear disarmament, and\r\nunless the nuclear-weapon States take practical steps to\r\nprove the seriousness of their undertakings, efforts to\r\nprevent the proliferation of nuclear arms will be utterly\r\nworthless and any claims concerning the destruction of\r\nnuclear arms will be a major act of deception that will\r\nnot fool the peoples of the world.\r\nTerrorism still constitutes a source of grave\r\ndanger to humanity, because no effective measures\r\nhave been taken to trace the roots of this phenomenon\r\nin order to eradicate it. My country, which has been a\r\ndirect victim of state terrorism, has relentlessly\r\nreiterated its strong condemnation of terrorist acts and\r\nits willingness to cooperate with all international\r\nefforts aimed at their elimination. My countrys\r\neagerness to put an end to terrorism was so strong that\r\nwe called in 1992 for the convening of a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly to consider methods\r\nto eradicate all forms of terrorism and violence.\r\nToday, in reiterating this request, it is most\r\nimportant that we clarify that the correct approach to\r\neliminating terrorism must begin with providing a\r\ndefinition for terrorism that is universal, objective,\r\ndemocratic and scientific. It is genuinely unacceptable\r\nthat some still classify the struggle of peoples for their\r\nfreedom and the fight of persecuted groups against\r\ntheir persecutors as forms of terrorism, whereas they\r\nturn a blind eye to real terrorism, embodied in unjust\r\nsanctions, occupation, invasion, foreign military bases,\r\nnaval fleets, weapons of mass destruction and the use\r\nand threat of use of force. Unless all such matters are\r\ndealt with, it is certain that any international efforts to\r\neliminate terrorism will be of no avail.\r\nWe believe that it has become necessary to take\r\nadditional measures to reinforce international systems,\r\nsuch as the Statute of the International Criminal Court,\r\nconcerned with the punishment of perpetrators of the\r\nmost serious crimes against international security. In its\r\npresent form, the Statute is designed to try only the\r\nweak. We ask that it be modified to guarantee the trial\r\nof all perpetrators of acts of aggression, drug\r\nsmugglers and their trading partners, those responsible\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nfor massacres of innocent people, and those who\r\ncommit acts of aggression against United Nations\r\ntroops.\r\nWe look forward to the establishment of a world\r\nin which equality and justice prevail and which is free\r\nfrom discrimination, oppression and injustice. This will\r\nrequire the drafting of laws that preserve the rights of\r\nmother and child and guarantee that a person may own\r\nhis own house and be a partner in his own productive\r\nwork, that his basic needs will not be subject to\r\ncommercialization and that his rights are not usurped\r\nas a source of income.\r\nWe also look forward to taking practical measures\r\nthat lead to the realization of a world free from motives\r\nof aggression, manifestations of violence, epidemics\r\nand diseases. We also hope that efforts will be joined to\r\ncombat the phenomenon of the white poisons.\r\nMoreover, in order to protect our planet from the\r\ndangers that threaten it, we should work to eradicate\r\npests, strive to establish low-cost water desalination\r\nsystems and seek to prevent the flow of waters of\r\nrivers, rain and snow to seas and oceans. Furthermore,\r\nall factors that hinder the prevention of desertification\r\nand the expansion of agricultural development should\r\nbe removed. One of these factors is the problem of\r\nmines and other remnants of war from which many\r\ncountries, including my own, still suffer. There are still\r\nmillions of mines in our lands planted by the fighting\r\nforces during the Second World War. We hope that the\r\nStates responsible for planting these mines will\r\nrespond to the international decisions that call upon\r\nthem to make available maps for their locations and to\r\nprovide technical assistance for their removal.\r\nAllow me now to raise a subject that has\r\npreoccupied the attention of the international\r\ncommunity for the last seven years, namely the dispute\r\nbetween my country and a number of Western States\r\nconcerning the Lockerbie incident. I would like to\r\nfocus on the manner in which the Security Council has\r\ndealt with this issue since the suspension of the\r\nsanctions in April of last year. As you are well aware,\r\nmore than a year and a half have now elapsed since the\r\ntwo suspects appeared before the Scottish court\r\nconvened in the Netherlands. Almost the same period\r\nhas elapsed since the Secretary-General submitted his\r\nreport to the Security Council pursuant to resolutions\r\n883 (1993) and 1192 (1998), in which he confirmed\r\nthat my country has fulfilled the demands stated in the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Despite all these\r\ndevelopments, however, the Council has been\r\nprevented from adopting the resolution that requires\r\nthe lifting of the sanctions, because of the intransigence\r\nof one country, the United States. This intransigence\r\nhas been such that a threat to use the right of veto was\r\nvoiced.\r\nThe United States gave a number of justifications\r\nto prevent the Security Council from lifting the unjust\r\nsanctions imposed upon the Libyan people. The first of\r\nthese justifications is that Libya still supports\r\nterrorism. This is a groundless pretext. My country,\r\nwhich was itself a victim of terrorism in 1986 and\r\nbefore, has repeatedly declared its condemnation of\r\ninternational terrorism in all its aspects and forms, and\r\nstressed its support for all international efforts aimed at\r\nits eradication. Moreover, the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport has given irrefutable proof concerning the\r\nvacuity and lack of truth of all American claims that\r\nLibya supports terrorism.\r\nThe second of these American justifications is\r\nthat Libya should cooperate with the Scottish court\r\nconvened in the Netherlands. This is a refutable\r\njustification, as my country has pledged from the\r\nbeginning, that it will cooperate fully with the court.\r\nThis pledge has, in fact, been proven since the court\r\nstarted reviewing the case. In fact, the United States is\r\nthe one that has not fully cooperated with the court by\r\nhiding basic information requested by the court, which\r\nin itself violates Security Council resolutions that call\r\nupon all States, and in particular the concerned ones, to\r\ncooperate with the Scottish court sitting in the\r\nNetherlands.\r\nThe third, and the strangest of these justifications,\r\nis the demand that Libya pay compensation to the\r\nfamilies of the victims of the Pan Am Flight 103. The\r\nquestion to be raised here is: How could the United\r\nStates ask for compensation while the Scottish court\r\nhas not yet reached a verdict? Does this not constitute a\r\ncomplete disregard for the legal principle that\r\nstipulates a presumption of innocence until the accused\r\nis proven guilty? Furthermore, why does the United\r\nStates jump to conclusions and deliver a ready\r\nconviction, while acquittal or conviction is a matter for\r\nthe court alone to decide? Libyas fulfilment of its\r\nobligations was confirmed by the Secretary- Generals\r\nreport a year and a half ago. It was also reaffirmed by\r\nthe decisions of the Summit of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, the Non-Aligned Movement, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the Arab\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nLeague and lastly the Group of 77 and China, which\r\ncalled for a complete lifting of the unjust sanctions\r\nimposed on the Libyan people.\r\nIn view of all of the above, my country demands\r\nthe following:\r\nFirst, this issue should not politicize, as it has\r\nnow become a legal matter that should be left to the\r\ndiscretion of the Scottish court convened in the\r\nNetherlands without interference from any parties.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council should, as early as\r\npossible, adopt a resolution under which the sanctions\r\nimposed on the Libyan people are fully and irrevocably\r\nlifted. This is the only procedure that reaffirms the\r\ncommitment of the Council to paragraph (16) of its\r\nresolution 883 (1993), and the second paragraph of its\r\nresolution 1192 (1998). It would also reaffirm the\r\nCouncils response to the wishes of the absolute\r\nmajority of the international community, on whose\r\nbehalf the Council is supposed to work.\r\nShould the Council be further hindered from\r\nadopting the required resolution, my country will have\r\nno choice but to resort to this august Assembly so it\r\ncould take the necessary measures to vindicate us vis-\r\nà-vis one State that refuses to lift the sanctions, a State\r\nthat was behind the imposition of these sanctions in the\r\nfirst place.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Joschka Fischer, Deputy Chancellor and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Germany.\r\nMr. Fischer (Germany) (spoke in German;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): First of all I\r\nwould like to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and wish you every success with\r\nyour work. I would like to thank Foreign Minister\r\nGurirab for his dedication in chairing the fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I welcome Tuvalu as\r\nthe one hundred and eighty-ninth member of the United\r\nNations and congratulate it on its accession. I endorse\r\nthe statement of my French colleague, Hubert Védrine,\r\non behalf of the European Union.\r\nAt this session of the General Assembly, the first\r\nin the new millennium, we are asked to determine the\r\nfuture tasks of the United Nations and which reforms\r\nare necessary in order to master them. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which we all adopted on 8 September,\r\nshows us the way forward. The implementation of this\r\nDeclaration should be a main focus of the consultations\r\nof this and future sessions of the General Assembly. I\r\npropose that the Secretary-General make use of the\r\nopportunity to draw up review reports at the beginning\r\nof the next session of the General Assembly.\r\nThere was one issue in particular which\r\ndominated this debate, namely globalization. It will\r\nradically change the economy and finances, politics\r\nand culture everywhere. The question is, will a new\r\norder which guarantees peace, justice and an equal\r\nshare in our common progress be established or will a\r\nnew divide evolve in the world? Will the future of the\r\nglobalized world manifest its pluralist character in a\r\nmultilateral order? Only the future can provide the\r\nanswers to these questions.\r\nParticularly for developing countries,\r\nglobalization offers great opportunities. If it\r\nnevertheless provokes strong opposition, this lies in the\r\nimbalances of this historical process. Indeed, just under\r\na decade after the end of the cold war, our world is\r\ntoday at risk from a new divide, one between the\r\nwinners and losers of the economic globalization\r\nprocess. In his impressive Millennium Report, the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, rightly highlights\r\nthe growing inequalities in the distribution of income,\r\nresources, investments and access to new technologies.\r\nIn view of this situation, the international\r\ncommunity must make every effort in the coming\r\ndecade to ensure that globalization benefits all peoples.\r\nIf market forces are not balanced by a political\r\ncorrective mechanism, it is to be expected that injustice\r\nin the world will increase further. Those who have been\r\nhitherto excluded from the advantages of globalization\r\nmust be included to a greater extent. They must be\r\ngiven more say in the political decisions made about\r\nsteering global processes and they must be given an\r\nopportunity to gain a fairer share in the development of\r\nthe world economy.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, we will, more than\r\never before, need a form of global governance if we are\r\nto solve global challenges. The United Nations will\r\nplay a key role here. It is the only organization within\r\nwhich the injustice between rich and poor can be\r\novercome and where a reconciliation between peoples\r\nand regions, global peace and sustainable development\r\ncan be achieved.\r\nGreatly strengthening the United Nations capacity\r\nto act is, therefore, a crucial question for the whole of\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nhumanity in the twenty-first century. In addition to the\r\ncrucial reform of the Security Council, this will entail\r\nthe United Nations entering into creative partnerships\r\nwith industry and civil society.\r\nGermany strongly supports the Secretary-\r\nGenerals idea for a global compact with major\r\ncompanies. The German initiative for a resolution in\r\nthe General Assembly on global partnerships will take\r\nup this and other issues relating to the globalization\r\nprocess.\r\nGlobal poverty is the key problem in North-South\r\nrelations. It lies at the root of many global risks and\r\nthreats to peace. The Secretary-General provided\r\nprecise and stimulating analyses of this in his report.\r\nThe industrialized nations have a special\r\nobligation to support the poorest of the poor. With the\r\nCologne debt initiative launched by Germany, we are\r\ncombining debt relief with a strategy to combat\r\npoverty. The 20 poorest developing countries should be\r\ndebt-free by the end of the year.\r\nThe least developed countries should be granted\r\naccess to world markets with the greatest possible\r\nexemption from duties and quotas. We must, also by\r\nway of liberalization steps in the World Trade\r\nOrganization, prevent these countries from being\r\nsocially excluded even further.\r\nThis applies in particular to the new economy.\r\nThe United Nations and its Member States must\r\nintensify their efforts to make it easier for these\r\ncountries to use the information and communication\r\ntechnologies. This is contingent upon initiatives in the\r\nfield of education, as well as the availability of the\r\nnecessary resources.\r\nHowever, how can poor countries ever catch up\r\neconomically if they are, at the same time, afflicted to a\r\nmuch greater degree than the North by terrible\r\ndiseases? The fight against the disastrous spread of the\r\nAIDS virus, particularly in Africa, must be priority for\r\nus all. The focus must be on prevention. At the same\r\ntime, access to medicines must be improved and\r\nvaccine research must be intensified. The World Banks\r\npromising idea of establishing a future fund for the\r\npurchase of vaccines deserves every support.\r\nParticularly in the fight against AIDS, new partnerships\r\nbetween Governments and companies are crucial.\r\nThe second major issue of this General Assembly\r\nis peacekeeping. The Secretary-General showed the\r\nway ahead with the Brahimi report. The\r\nrecommendations it contains should be examined and\r\nimplemented as quickly as possible. Germany will play\r\nits part. Peace missions need a more robust mandate, as\r\nwell as more personnel and equipment. Member States\r\nmust do considerably more to ensure the rapid\r\nsecondment of well-trained troops, police officers and\r\ncivilian experts. The further development of the police\r\nconcept is one of the most important tasks in this\r\nconnection  as the last few months and years have, in\r\nfact been teaching us.\r\nThe German Government will offer German\r\ntraining for civilian peace-mission personnel and offer\r\ncivilian capacities to the United Nations stand-by\r\nsystem. In addition, we are drafting a plan for training\r\ncivilian experts for peace missions, thus creating a pool\r\nof qualified personnel who can be deployed at short\r\nnotice.\r\nThe prevailing form of conflict today is conflict\r\nwithin States. Therefore the main task of peacekeeping\r\nmust be to address the internal roots of conflicts. In\r\naddition to focusing on an improvement in socio-\r\neconomic conditions, our efforts must focus on\r\npromoting human rights, democracy and the rule of\r\nlaw. Mary Robinson, the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, aptly said that the\r\nhuman rights violations of today are the wars of\r\ntomorrow.\r\nNumerous concrete tasks are on the agenda. The\r\nprotocols relating to the involvement of children in\r\narmed conflict and to the sale of children, child\r\nprostitution and child pornography must enter into\r\nforce as early as possible. The equality of women must\r\nbe advanced in all spheres. I call upon all states to\r\nratify quickly the new Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women and to abolish all laws\r\nthat discriminate against women by 2005. The World\r\nConference against racism, to be held in 2001, must\r\ntackle all aspects of this issue. Out of a sense of\r\nresponsibility for our history, our State and our society\r\nwill stand up firmly against all forms of right-wing\r\nradicalism, racism and anti-Semitism, both in our own\r\ncountry and in the world.\r\nI call upon all States to respect the integrity of the\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, to sign and\r\nto ratify it, so that the Court can commence work soon.\r\nThere can be no exceptions to the Rome Statute.\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nOne of the greatest dangers facing humanity\r\nremains the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. The risk of regional arms races,\r\nparticularly in South Asia, has increased. Further\r\ndeveloping the international arms-control regime\r\ntherefore continues to be one of the United Nations key\r\ntasks. This will require resolute implementation of the\r\nresults of the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons. Against this background, President Clintons\r\ndecision not to commit now to the development of a\r\nnational missile defence system is very welcome. The\r\nAnti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty must remain as a\r\ncornerstone of strategic stability and the basis for\r\nfurther nuclear-disarmament measures.\r\nIn poor countries the excessive stockpiling of\r\nsmall arms must be stopped. We must therefore do\r\neverything we can to achieve tangible progress at the\r\nUnited Nations small arms conference to be held in\r\n2001. This presupposes the inclusion of all aspects,\r\nincluding the legal transfer of production and\r\nstockpiles.\r\nRegional cooperation has proved to be an\r\nextremely effective means of preventing conflicts. The\r\nUnited Nations can do much to help here. Allow me to\r\nmention two regions where progress is particularly\r\nurgent. The triangle between Central Asia, the\r\nCaucasus and the Middle East is full of destabilizing\r\nfactors  oil, religious fundamentalism, terrorism,\r\ndrugs and the nuclear arms race  and this area is\r\nthreatening to become the crisis region of the century\r\nahead. A new comprehensive regional process, along\r\nthe lines of the Helsinki model, which fosters\r\ncooperation instead of confrontation, could play an\r\nimportant stabilizing role. Germany is prepared to take\r\npart in such a process.\r\nIn Africa, regional approaches have gained in\r\nsignificance. In the main, however, it is, unfortunately,\r\ntoo early to talk of effective peacekeeping structures.\r\nUnfortunately, the efforts on the part of the United\r\nNations and of the Organization of African Unity to\r\nresolve the conflicts in the Congo and Sierra Leone\r\nhave not achieved a breakthrough so far. In the conflict\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea it is to be hoped that the\r\nceasefire that has finally been concluded will be\r\nconsolidated and that the United Nations peace mission\r\nwill be lent the full support of the parties to the\r\nconflict.\r\nThe third issue, protection of our natural\r\nenvironment, will probably become the crucial issue\r\naffecting our planet. In the course of the twentieth\r\ncentury the worlds population quadrupled, while\r\nconsumption of energy and raw materials increased\r\ntenfold. We must end the squandering of natural\r\nresources and switch to renewable energy sources as\r\nquickly as possible. This cannot only be a matter for\r\nindustrialized nations. We are witnessing at this very\r\nmoment what a burden high oil prices places on poor\r\ncountries in particular. It must be in the interest of all\r\nStates to bring about the transition from the oil to the\r\nhydrogen age as quickly as possible. The most\r\nimportant thing now is to finally overcome the\r\ndeadlock in the climate-protection negotiations and to\r\nensure that the Kyoto Protocol can be implemented by\r\n2002, 10 years after the Rio Summit.\r\nAnother key issue for humanity, the future of\r\ngenetic engineering, can only be mastered within the\r\nframework of a global consensus. Genetic engineering\r\nhas the potential to revolutionalize medicine and\r\nagriculture. At the same time, it raises more ethical and\r\nhuman rights questions than any other technology. Do\r\nwe not need clear, binding rules for dealing with such a\r\npowerful new technology? Why do we not seriously\r\nconsider within the United Nations creating under\r\ninternational law a convention that meaningfully\r\npromotes genetic engineering and safeguards the\r\nfreedom to research and the findings of this research,\r\nwhile, at the same time, defining an ethical basis and\r\nguaranteeing protection against abuse?\r\nThe Millennium Declaration points the way\r\nahead. But what help will that be if an increasing\r\nnumber of Members allow the worlds real problems to\r\nbe dealt with and decided somewhere else? If we do\r\nnot succeed in adapting the United Nations to deal with\r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century and in\r\nmodernizing it fully, it will be sidelined, with fatal\r\nconsequences for peace and development, human\r\nrights, the environment and social progress.\r\nWe will all, rich and poor, lose out.\r\nWe must therefore muster the strength to\r\nresolutely implement the Millennium Declaration. We\r\nneed a world Organization that is strong and we must\r\nuse its scarce resources more effectively. An important\r\nprerequisite for this is that the United Nations be\r\nplaced finally on a solid financial footing. Together\r\nwith its European Union partners, Germany has put\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nforward proposals for a fairer, more balanced scale of\r\nassessments, which must continue to be based on\r\nMember States ability to pay..\r\nThe Security Council no longer reflects the\r\npolitical reality of our world at the dawn of the new\r\nmillennium. We share the Secretary-Generals view\r\nthat this central steering organ of the international\r\ncommunity must become more representative,\r\nlegitimate and effective, also involving the developing\r\ncountries. Last week Chancellor Schroeder reaffirmed\r\nGermanys willingness to take on more responsibility\r\nin this connection. I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto thank my friend and colleague Robin Cook for the\r\nclear language that he used before the General\r\nAssembly just a few minutes ago.\r\nThe General Assembly must structure its work,\r\ndebate global problems in a more focused fashion than\r\nhitherto and identify courses of action. The synergetic\r\npotential between United Nations organizations, for\r\nexample in the environmental field, must be better used\r\nand resources pooled to a greater extent by merging\r\norganizations.\r\nReform of the United Nations will play a decisive\r\nrole in ensuring that the twenty-first century is safer\r\nand more just than the twentieth century. Allow me to\r\nconclude with a quote from the Secretary-Generals\r\nMillennium Report:\r\nNo shift in the way we think or act can be\r\nmore critical than this: we must put people at the\r\ncentre of everything we do ... Only when that\r\nbegins to happen will we know that globalization\r\nis indeed becoming inclusive, allowing everyone\r\nto share its opportunities. (A/54/2000, para. 16)\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nFarouk Al-Shara, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Farouk Al-Shara (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of this General\r\nAssembly session. We are confident that the posts you\r\nhave assumed in your country and the international\r\nrespect that you enjoy will facilitate the task entrusted\r\nto you in leading the deliberations of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to their desired objectives.\r\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia for his\r\nefforts in leading the work of the previous session to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. I would be remiss if I failed to\r\nthank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\nefforts to maintain the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter and for the distinguished role he has played in\r\ncrystallizing the idea of convening the Millennium\r\nSummit last week. It was indeed an unusual event in\r\nUnited Nations history.\r\nThe historic Millennium Summit Declaration\r\nconfirmed unequivocally and clearly the commitment\r\nof all the Heads of State and Government of the world\r\nto the principles and purposes of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. We believe that the absence of any\r\nsubstantial difference between the Charter and the\r\nDeclaration is an important achievement in itself. The\r\nhistoric Declaration issued by the Millennium Summit\r\nmay be considered, in one way or another, as a\r\nrenewed vote of confidence in the Charter, particularly,\r\nas the world has recently witnessed major changes and\r\ndangerous challenges. One may therefore conclude that\r\nthe principles and purposes adopted by peoples and\r\nnations do not undergo major changes with the passage\r\nof time.\r\nIt would be wrong to underestimate the\r\nsignificance of this conclusion for the history of the\r\nUnited Nations. The end of the cold war did not\r\nprevent the peoples and nations of the world from\r\ndenouncing and condemning crimes of aggression,\r\nethnic-cleansing, foreign occupation, oppression,\r\nextremism, injustice, corruption, racism and double\r\nstandards. Nor did this make us hesitate to glorify\r\nmany noble objectives, such as freedom, peace,\r\nequality, solidarity, tolerance, human rights and social\r\njustice.\r\nIt is fortunate that third world countries and poor\r\ncountries host large populations with bountiful\r\nresources and great heritage. This constitutes a safety\r\nnet for those countries that were able to contribute to\r\nmaintaining the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations when drafting the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThis explains the lack of any reference to the new\r\nworld order, either in the Millennium Summit\r\nDeclaration or in any other official text. Regrettably,\r\nhowever, this becomes evident in reality, whereby\r\nhegemony seems to have the upper hand in the\r\ninternational arena.\r\nStrengthening the role of the United Nations was\r\nthe main topic on the Summits agenda. This role\r\nwould also become clear in reforming the Security\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nCouncil and expanding its membership. The United\r\nNations membership considers the Council the\r\nOrganizations primary organ. This reform process\r\nshould be accomplished by expanding the Security\r\nCouncil membership, the granting of equitable and fair\r\ngeographical representation and the gradual phasing\r\nout of the use of the right of veto, which contradicts the\r\nconcept of democracy, particularly when its aim is\r\nnothing short of undermining the democratic process.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations have\r\ncontributed to creating conditions conducive to ending\r\nthe deterioration of security conditions in many\r\ncountries of the world. Throughout the past years, the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic has done everything it could to\r\npreserve the security and safety of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping personnel and to ensure that they\r\nsuccessfully carry out their missions and mandates. But\r\npeacekeeping operations must be confined to enforcing\r\nUnited Nations resolutions and those of international\r\nlegitimacy. The Security Council has therefore to\r\nenforce its resolutions so that peacekeeping operations\r\nwill not simply become operations to impose the status\r\nquo, which makes the achievement of true peace a very\r\nelusive objective.\r\nThe peace process launched in Madrid has been\r\nlosing its momentum, incentive and compass, day after\r\nday and year after year. The Security Council, which\r\nhas the authority and international legitimacy to\r\nenforce its own resolutions, has been kept out of the\r\nMiddle East peace process. It has become a silent\r\nwitness to the fact that the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast has reached a dead end.\r\nIt has become quite obvious to all those involved\r\nin the peace process, both inside and outside our\r\nregion, that continued Israeli occupation of Arab\r\nterritories  which is sometimes explained by Israels\r\npsychological need for security and at other times by\r\nsuperstitious myths  is the major obstacle on the road\r\nto peace. Those futile claims, which have no\r\nfoundation in reality whatsoever, have caused the peace\r\nprocess to become an endless negotiating process with\r\nneither end nor resolution in sight.\r\nAt any rate, the serious and carefully considered\r\nnegotiations that Syria has conducted have proven to\r\nthe international community at large, and to Arabs in\r\nparticular, two main things: first, that Israel is neither\r\ndesirous of, nor serious about, pursuing a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in accordance with United\r\nNations resolutions; and, secondly, that Syria has the\r\nright to a full return of the entire Golan, to the 4 June\r\n1967 line, without concessions or compromises.\r\nWe would like to mention another fact known to\r\nour foes and friends alike. That fact is that Syria has\r\nunreservedly supported every Arab and Palestinian\r\nright during every stage of the peace talks. It did not\r\ntake those positions to embarrass anyone or to\r\nnegotiate on their behalf. As a matter of principle,\r\nSyria has been, and continues to be, committed to the\r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people to return to\r\ntheir lands, to self-determination, and to establish their\r\nindependent State on their national soil. On that basis,\r\nSyria presented its position clearly and firmly at the\r\nmeeting of the Jerusalem Committee that was convened\r\nin Morocco at the end of last month in support of the\r\nrights of Muslims and Arabs to full and\r\nuncompromised Palestinian sovereignty over Al-Quds\r\nAl-Sharif.\r\nThe Arabs are an ancient and time-honoured\r\nnation known for its religious tolerance. But tolerance\r\nis one thing and conceding ones rights is something\r\nelse. Territory and sovereignty are matters of national\r\ndignity that can never be forfeited or compromised.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, the countries of the\r\nworld expressed their belief that we live today in an\r\nage of international law and under the United Nations\r\nCharter, international legitimacy and human rights, and\r\nnot in an age of the law of the jungle and futile\r\nreligious claims to justify the usurpation of other\r\npeoples land by force. This requires from the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations a\r\nmore firm and non-selective stand in defending the\r\nCharter and international law and in prompting Israel\r\nto respect international legitimacy and international\r\nconventions and to implement the resolutions of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe brotherly Lebanese people have achieved a\r\nhistoric milestone, thanks to their solidarity and that of\r\ntheir State, in strongly resisting Israeli occupation.\r\nSyria stood by Lebanon firmly in order to ensure the\r\nfull implementation of resolution 425 (1978). Syria\r\nwill always stand by Lebanon and support all its\r\nnational issues, especially the ones concerning the\r\nreturn of all its territory and the return of its hostages\r\nheld in Israeli jails. In this regard, we urge the donor\r\ncountries to fulfil their commitments to help Lebanon\r\nrebuild what Israel has destroyed, particularly the\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\ndamage it caused during its occupation of southern\r\nLebanon.\r\nFrom this international forum, Syria would like\r\nonce again to stress the great importance it attaches to\r\nmaintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq. We call for\r\nrelieving the suffering of the Iraqi people by lifting the\r\neconomic sanctions that only affect the people. We also\r\nstand against any measures taken against Iraq outside\r\nthe context of United Nations resolutions so that those\r\nresolutions will retain the necessary credibility to bring\r\nabout their implementation.\r\nWe also deem it necessary to find a just and\r\nhumane solution to the question of Kuwaiti and other\r\nprisoners of war, within a practical framework agreed\r\nupon between the Kuwaiti and Iraqi sides. We do not\r\nwant the issue of prisoners of war and missing persons\r\nto remain outside the human and political framework\r\nthat will allow us to arrive at a solution.\r\nSyria also calls upon the Security Council to\r\nquickly and permanently lift the sanctions it imposed\r\nagainst Libya. Libya has delivered on all its\r\ncommitments under Security Council resolutions. We\r\nfully support Libyas demands.\r\nIn view of the strong, brotherly relations between\r\nSyria, the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, we call upon the two neighbouring\r\ncountries to pursue negotiations to resolve peacefully\r\nthe dispute over the three islands on the basis of the\r\nprinciples of good neighbourliness and mutual respect.\r\nSyria believes that the establishment of a trilateral\r\ncommittee to pave the way for direct negotiations\r\nbetween Iran and the United Arab Emirates through the\r\ncreation of favourable conditions is a practical\r\ninitiative. We hope that it will allow the two parties to\r\narrive at a satisfactory conclusion.\r\nWe would like to welcome the achievements of\r\nthe representatives of Somalia in forming a temporary\r\nSomali parliament and electing Mr. AbdiKassim Salad\r\nHassan as President of democratic Somalia. We\r\nconsider these achievements as major pillars for the\r\nrestoration of Somali State institutions. We call upon\r\nthe international community to redouble its efforts to\r\nhelp Somalis carry out the tasks of reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation.\r\nThe continued tragic situation in Afghanistan is a\r\nsource of great concern to us. We are convinced that\r\nthe problem of Afghanistan can only be solved by\r\nstopping the fighting and beginning negotiations aimed\r\nat achieving national reconciliation. It must also be\r\nsolved by finding an acceptable and permanent\r\npolitical settlement that brings about security and\r\nstability for the Afghan people. Many Arab and Islamic\r\ncountries fear that continued and senseless fighting in\r\nAfghanistan may lead to undermining the concept of\r\nthe State in that country and to destroying its heritage\r\nand whatever is left of its historic traditions.\r\nSyria welcomes the discussions convened at the\r\nhighest level in Pyongyang in June 2000. We express\r\nthe hope that this rapprochement between the two\r\nKoreas will contribute to achieving the aspirations of\r\nthe Korean people in reunifying the peninsula through\r\npeaceful means.\r\nThere was a consensus in the statements delivered\r\nat the Millennium Summit and in the Summit\r\nDeclaration about the need to exert all possible efforts\r\nto rid humanity of the humiliating and inhumane\r\nconditions of extreme poverty, in which more than a\r\nbillion people live. The Summit stressed the\r\ncommitment of Member States to basic human rights,\r\nas well as to the right of every country to development.\r\nWe think this will require developing a new economic\r\ninternational order that is just, fair and democratic. It\r\nwill also require finding a multilateral commercial and\r\nfinancial system characterized by transparency,\r\nequality and non-discrimination. We must also find the\r\nbest mechanism possible to solve developmental\r\nproblems, especially on the African continent. Such a\r\nsystem should also give preferential treatment to\r\ndeveloping countries in order to facilitate investment\r\nand the transfer of technology and know-how. That\r\nwould allow for full, effective and equal participation\r\nby the South in the process of decision-making at the\r\ninternational level. Although these requests seem far-\r\nfetched now, they will in the final analysis serve all\r\nparties and States, whether they be rich or poor, in the\r\nNorth or in the South.\r\nWe had fervently hoped that a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East would have\r\nbeen achieved by the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury and with the ushering in of this new\r\nmillennium. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic. Peace\r\nwill remain our strategic choice and that of all peoples\r\nwho aspire to a bright future in which peace, security\r\nand prosperity prevail for human beings everywhere.\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nThe President: As members can see, we are\r\nmaking good progress this morning as far as the list of\r\nspeakers is concerned, and there will be some time\r\nremaining. In view of this, Bosnia and Herzegovina has\r\nagreed to be the last speaker at this meeting.\r\nI now give the floor to the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ireland, His Excellency Mr. Brian Cowen.\r\nMr. Cowen (Ireland): Your election, Sir, as\r\nPresident of the Millennium Assembly is fitting\r\nrecognition of your great dedication to international\r\npeace. Ireland is especially grateful for your\r\noutstanding contribution to the Good Friday agreement\r\nsigned in Belfast in 1998. We are sure that the qualities\r\nthat you displayed then will serve you well in guiding\r\nthe work of this session.\r\nOur thanks are due also to Foreign Minister\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, the wise and thoughtful\r\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are happy also to welcome Tuvalu as a\r\nnew Member of the Organization.\r\nMy colleague, Foreign Minister Védrine of\r\nFrance, has already addressed the Assembly on behalf\r\nof the European Union. Ireland is fully associated with\r\nhis remarks.\r\nThe Declaration adopted at the historic\r\nMillennium Summit sets out the principles, objectives\r\nand targets which should inspire the work of this\r\nsession. Ireland is fully committed to these principles\r\nand objectives, and we are determined to work\r\nvigorously to achieve real results. Critics of the United\r\nNations may doubt our ability to achieve such results;\r\nwe are determined to prove them wrong. Such critics\r\nignore the considerable achievements of the\r\nOrganization in recent years. Major reform of all\r\naspects of the Organization has resulted in a more\r\nefficient, streamlined operation. We will work with\r\nothers to strengthen the United Nations in order to\r\nfulfil the commitment made in the Declaration  to\r\nensure a more effective instrument for pursuing the\r\nfight for peace and development and against poverty,\r\nignorance and disease.\r\nThe cause of peace transcends all other\r\nchallenges. Whether in the Middle East, the Western\r\nBalkans, Africa or, indeed, in our own island of\r\nIreland, determined efforts to build a secure and\r\ndurable peace must be tirelessly pursued. Our own\r\nexperience in Ireland has taught us that there is no\r\ngreater prize, no more difficult task and no greater\r\nsatisfaction than to begin to heal the wounds of history\r\nand the scars of intolerance.\r\nOur own efforts at building peace have convinced\r\nus that to be effective, such efforts require international\r\nsupport and validation. We have also learned that\r\neconomic development goes hand in hand with\r\nbuilding a society with hope in its own future and\r\npledged to overcome the bitterness of the past. It is this\r\nexperience which helps guide our approach to peace-\r\nbuilding in the wider world. It is this experience of\r\npeace-building and development which we will bring\r\nto the deliberations of the Security Council if elected\r\nby the membership in the coming weeks.\r\nSecurity and development are indivisible and\r\ninterrelated. Yet too often we in the international\r\ncommunity stand aside as hapless witnesses, hesitating\r\nto become involved, while the innocent suffer. We need\r\nto strengthen the capacity and commitment of the\r\nOrganization to fulfil its mandates. I therefore strongly\r\nwelcome the exercise of its authority by the United\r\nNations in East Timor last year and, more recently, in\r\nSierra Leone. It is our duty as Governments to\r\nunderpin that authority.\r\nWe must address those issues which prolong\r\nconflict, even when root causes become blurred. Let\r\nme give two examples. First, the illicit flow of small\r\narms and light weapons into areas of conflict must be\r\nstopped; and secondly, trafficking in high-value\r\ncommodities, particularly the trade in so-called blood\r\ndiamonds, which has exacerbated conflicts in Africa,\r\nmust be prevented. Carefully targeted, time-limited\r\nsanctions will help to counter this menace.\r\nEnhancing the role of the United Nations in\r\npeacekeeping is a priority for this session. To broaden\r\nthat role, we urge an integrated approach combining\r\nprevention, settlement and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding. While the Security Council has a global remit\r\nto maintain international peace and security in every\r\nregion of the world, it is right that it pay special\r\nattention at this time to the promotion of durable peace\r\nin Africa. We therefore welcome the declared intention\r\nof the Security Council at the Millennium Summit to\r\nensure that it plays a more effective role in this urgent\r\nand necessary task.\r\nPeacekeeping is at the heart of Irelands\r\ncontribution to the United Nations. For more than 40\r\nyears we have participated continuously in United\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. Irish personnel have\r\nserved under United Nations command in the Middle\r\nEast, Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe. We are\r\nproud of the contribution which our peacekeepers have\r\nmade in so many areas of the world. At the same time,\r\nwe deeply regret that 82 of our Irish soldiers have died\r\nin the service of the United Nations. Other Member\r\nStates have also sustained losses, and I would like to\r\nexpress my deep regret at the brutal attack last week on\r\nUnited Nations personnel in West Timor as well as at\r\nthe recent outrages in Sierra Leone.\r\nIt is because of our own long, and at times\r\nfrustrating, experience of peacekeeping that Ireland\r\nwelcomes the publication of the Brahimi report. In the\r\nlight of this experience, I will focus in particular on\r\nthree aspects.\r\nFirst, the United Nations must have the resources\r\nand capacity to deliver well-planned and effective\r\npeace support operations. The Member States must\r\ngive the Secretary-General and his staff the means to\r\ndo the job.\r\nSecondly, if the United Nations is to save lives, it\r\nmust be capable of deploying into conflict areas\r\nrapidly. This requires rapid decision-making.\r\nThirdly, effective operations depend on well-\r\ntrained peacekeepers. A more integrated approach must\r\nbe taken to develop training and equipment of United\r\nNations peacekeeping personnel. Irelands own United\r\nNations Training School has provided such training to\r\nover 170 officers from 40 countries, and we intend to\r\nenhance this role in cooperation with like-minded\r\ncountries.\r\nTo those ends, we will contribute actively in this\r\nAssembly to the urgent follow-up of the proposals that\r\nhave been put forward.\r\nProgress in disarmament remains crucially\r\nimportant both to the maintenance of peace and to\r\ndevelopment. At the sixth Review Conference of the\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, very considerable efforts were made\r\nby all the States parties to ensure a successful outcome.\r\nThat reflects the central role of the Treaty in the\r\nachievement of a world free of nuclear weapons. The\r\noutcome highlights the underlying premise of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty: that these weapons do not provide\r\nassurances of peace and security. The threat to\r\nhumanity posed by their continued existence will\r\nremain until we achieve an effective and global ban.\r\nThere have been welcome and significant\r\nreductions by the nuclear-weapon States of their\r\narsenals. But defence strategies based on nuclear\r\nweapons continue to include the possible use, even the\r\nfirst use, of those weapons. The Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty is not a charter for the indefinite retention of\r\nnuclear weapons by any State. It represents a clear\r\nobligation to make nuclear disarmament a reality. At\r\nthe Review Conference, the parties to the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty came closer in their common\r\nunderstanding of what is demanded by the Treaty. In\r\nthat connection, the unequivocal commitment to the\r\ntotal elimination of their nuclear weapons made by the\r\nnuclear-weapon States is of fundamental significance.\r\nHowever, let us not lull ourselves into\r\ncomplacency because we have reached agreement on a\r\nprogramme of action. We now have an opportunity to\r\nbegin the root-and-branch elimination of these\r\nweapons. Progress is primarily dependent on action by\r\nthe five nuclear-weapon States. States which\r\nparticipate in security arrangements involving nuclear\r\nweapons have a particular responsibility to diminish\r\nthe role of nuclear weapons in security policies. All\r\nStates share a responsibility to advance negotiation on\r\nthose measures needed to guarantee a world free of\r\nnuclear weapons. For our part, Ireland and our partners\r\nin the New Agenda Coalition are determined to work\r\nvigorously for the achievement of that goal.\r\nI referred earlier to the role of conventional arms\r\nin conflict situations. The ravages and suffering caused\r\nby small arms as well as by landmines are immense.\r\nWe are, at least in the case of landmines, beginning to\r\nsee positive results from the implementation of the\r\nOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction. The practical outcome\r\nhas been the destruction of over 22 million mines by\r\nsome 50 States; expenditure on mine clearance has\r\nmore than doubled, and countless lives have been\r\nsaved.\r\nNext year, the United Nations will focus on small\r\narms with the first international conference specifically\r\naddressing that issue. We must set ambitious goals for\r\nthe conference so that we may have a basis for making\r\ngenuine inroads on the culture of violence fostered by\r\nthe dissemination of those weapons.\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nPeace and development are essential to each\r\nother. Without peace, there can be no development.\r\nWithout development, peace is hard to sustain. Without\r\nfreedom from the threat of war, from human rights\r\nabuse and from famine, there can be no lasting human\r\nprogress. The elimination of poverty and access to\r\nbasic health care and education are crucial to\r\nsustainable development. Nonetheless, we witness\r\ntoday an unprecedented contrast between the prosperity\r\nof developed countries and the poverty of those that\r\nhave been left behind. And yet, at the same time, we\r\nare witnessing an actual decline in the international\r\ncommunitys development aid levels. Clearly, that\r\ntrend must be reversed.\r\nIt has long been an objective of Irish\r\nGovernments to bring our development cooperation\r\neffort into line with our national economic growth and\r\nto meet the United Nations development cooperation\r\ntarget. Last week our Government took an important\r\nstep forward by when our Taoiseach, our Prime\r\nMinister, Bertie Ahern, speaking at the Millennium\r\nSummit, committed Ireland to meet the United Nations\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by the\r\nend of 2007, and to reach the level of 0.45 per cent by\r\nthe end of 2002. This will clearly represent a\r\nsignificant increase in volume terms. Indeed, in\r\nmeeting our targets, we anticipate a fourfold increase\r\nby Ireland in our aid over the next seven years. That\r\nwill greatly increase our ability to make a real impact\r\non the lives of some of the poorest people on earth. Our\r\naid budget is both a test and a reflection of our\r\ncommitment to the values and principles set out in the\r\nMillennium Summit Declaration. We shall not fail in\r\nthis task we have set ourselves as a country: to be an\r\nexample to all who could contribute more.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, we are faced\r\nwith several development issues which require\r\nimmediate attention. We must begin to address the\r\nquestion of debt relief in a more coherent manner. The\r\nmost heavily indebted countries need a sound basis for\r\nthe achievement of acceptable levels of growth free\r\nfrom grinding debt. We must recognize that the burden\r\non those States is unsustainable in the face of the\r\nchallenges of poverty alleviation and AIDS.\r\nSpeed is essential in delivering results from the\r\nEnhanced Debt Initiative if it is to remain credible. In\r\naddition to a European Union contribution of almost\r\n$1 billion, Ireland has bilaterally contributed over\r\n$40 million in debt relief, although as a matter of\r\nprinciple we have never extended loans in the guise of\r\ndevelopment assistance. That is why our aid has always\r\nbeen in grant form, and why all of our development aid\r\nis also untied.\r\nGreater market access by the least developed\r\ncountries must be a priority. With the early\r\nimplementation of the European Unions commitment\r\nto grant duty-free and quota-free access to its market\r\nby the least developed countries by 2005, a major step\r\nin this direction will have been taken.\r\nOne of the greatest challenges to development is\r\nHIV/AIDS. If the spread of AIDS is to be arrested, we\r\nneed: strong political will in the leadership of the most\r\naffected countries; we need greater international\r\nresources; we need greater access to essential drugs at\r\nprices that are affordable; and we need more research\r\nfunds for the development of vaccines. The fight\r\nagainst AIDS is now an integral part of all Irish\r\ndevelopment activities, with funding budgeted for both\r\nprevention and the search for vaccines.\r\nRespect for human rights is central to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and the promotion of\r\ndevelopment. It underpins all the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations. Putting weapons in the hands of\r\nchildren and sending them into conflict undermines the\r\nmost basic rights and the innocence of the child. That\r\nis a scandal which cannot be allowed to continue.\r\nThrough the Optional Protocol to the Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child on the involvement of children\r\nin armed conflicts, which Ireland was among the first\r\nto sign, a start has been made in addressing this issue.\r\nBut much more must be done.\r\nThe establishment of an International Criminal\r\nCourt offers a unique opportunity to bring to justice the\r\nperpetrators of crimes against humanity and other\r\nserious violations of international law. Ireland is\r\nmoving rapidly to ratify the Statute. The international\r\ncriminal tribunals for former Yugoslavia and for\r\nRwanda demonstrate how necessary it is to exercise\r\ninternational jurisdiction to end the culture of impunity\r\nwhere violations of basic human rights occur.\r\nRacism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and\r\nintolerance persist in all our societies. The 2001 World\r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance will provide an\r\nopportunity to create a vision for the fight against\r\nracism and all intolerance for the coming century. I pay\r\ntribute here to the United Nations High Commissioner\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nfor Human Rights, Mary Robinson. Taoiseach Bertie\r\nAhern, TD, our Prime Minister, was pleased to be\r\namongst the first to sign the declaration entitled:\r\nTolerance and diversity: a vision for the twenty-first\r\ncentury, which was presented at the Millennium\r\nSummit. I believe that it will generate a positive\r\napproach to the World Conference.\r\nI know that our friends in the international\r\ncommunity continue to follow developments in the\r\npeace process in Ireland with close interest. Indeed, the\r\nGovernments of many Member States have played an\r\nimportant and concrete part in the successes we have\r\nachieved to date. I am particularly pleased therefore to\r\nbe able to report that in the past year, in the face of\r\nmany difficulties, we have made real progress towards\r\nthe full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.\r\nThe new political institutions are up and working\r\nwell. In Northern Ireland there is an Executive on\r\nwhich all parts of the community  nationalist,\r\nunionist and republican  are represented as of right,\r\nand where Ministers are working constructively\r\ntogether to improve the quality of life for all the\r\npeople. The North/South Ministerial Council, which\r\nbrings together Ministers from both jurisdictions on the\r\nisland, and the Implementation Bodies which it\r\noversees, are developing new ways of working\r\ntogether, delivering tangible benefits in areas of mutual\r\nimportance and interest. In the British-Irish Council,\r\nwe are forging new relationships, including with the\r\ndevolved administrations in Scotland and Wales.\r\nWe are firmly committed to ensuring that all\r\nother aspects of the Agreement are implemented in full.\r\nPolicing reform is a vital part of the new\r\ndispensation we are striving to create in Northern\r\nIreland. All sides of the community want to see an\r\neffective, accountable policing service to which they\r\ncan give allegiance and which young people, whatever\r\ntheir background, can join. The Agreement promised a\r\nnew beginning in this area, and the Patten Report set\r\nout how it can be achieved. It is now crucially\r\nimportant that the legislative proposals currently before\r\nParliament at Westminster secure that outcome.\r\nThe Agreement also contains extensive\r\ncommitments in the area of human rights, and we are\r\nworking to ensure that they are delivered. My\r\nGovernment has established an independent Human\r\nRights Commission, with a mandate and remit that\r\nsurpass the standards set in the Paris Principles. We are\r\nin the process of appointing its members. We look\r\nforward to the Commission working closely with its\r\ncounterpart in the North for the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights throughout the island of\r\nIreland.\r\nWe also need to see continued progress towards\r\nsecurity and justice arrangements appropriate to a\r\nsociety in which peace will become the norm, and to\r\nsee the question of arms resolved for all time. To this\r\nend, we have made great strides forward in recent\r\nmonths.\r\nOur task in the peace process has always been\r\nmore than the putting in place of a new set of\r\ninstitutions and arrangements, important though they\r\nundoubtedly are. We are endeavouring to create a new\r\nbeginning for what has been a deeply divided society, a\r\nnew beginning where the divisions of the past are\r\novercome. The task which the Irish Government has set\r\nitself is to work with others in peace and partnership,\r\nand in a spirit of mutual tolerance and respect, building\r\ntogether a better future for all of the people of Ireland.\r\nThis demands patience, persistence and perseverance.\r\nA great deal remains to be done.\r\nFar too many people continue to have their lives\r\nblighted by sectarianism and hatred. There are still\r\nthose who prefer to foster division, retarding rather\r\nthan advancing the cause of reconciliation. On both\r\nsides there are still small groups of dissidents prepared\r\nto use violence to bring down the Agreement and to\r\nfrustrate the democratically expressed wishes of the\r\npeople. They have nothing to offer, and they will not be\r\nallowed to succeed.\r\nIn Northern Ireland many people have yet to\r\nexperience the full benefits of change and the return of\r\nhope and normality to their lives. Some remain\r\nsceptical about the benefits of the Agreement. But,\r\nworking together with the British Government and with\r\nthe representatives of all sides of the community, we\r\nwill continue to do all in our power to convince them\r\nthat the Agreement represents not only a balanced and\r\nhonourable accommodation, but also the only way\r\nforward.\r\nThe international community has made an\r\nimportant contribution to our achievements to date.\r\nWithout the support and encouragement of the\r\ninternational community, we could not have come so\r\nfar. When we embarked on our journey towards peace,\r\nwe knew that it would take a great deal of time and of\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nwork to see the Agreement implemented in full. We\r\nremain firmly committed to the task and take heart\r\nfrom the substantial progress we have made and draw\r\ncourage from the international communitys continued\r\nsupport.\r\nIn the course of my statement I have set out my\r\nGovernments position on the key issues facing the\r\nUnited Nations. It is this approach and commitment\r\nthat will inform our actions if we are elected to the\r\nSecurity Council. Ireland is standing for election after\r\n20 years absence from the Council. We do so as a small\r\nState which has already made a significant contribution\r\nto the work of this Organization. Faithful to the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter, we have faced\r\nand tried to overcome the legacies of strife and\r\nunderdevelopment that have marked our own history.\r\nMembership of the Security Council will allow us to\r\nbring to the service of all the lessons of our own\r\nexperience, as well as our full commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Ms. Anna Lindh, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Sweden.\r\nMs. Lindh (Sweden): The individual human\r\nbeing must always be at the centre of our work.\r\nBurmese students fighting for democracy, victims of\r\nethnic violence in Kosovo, women in Afghanistan\r\ndenied their right to education and equality, children\r\ndying of curable diseases, people simply trying to\r\nsurvive in the utmost poverty  have given us our\r\ntask. Meeting the needs of the peoples and realizing\r\ntheir aspirations remain the starting point, the purpose\r\nand the vision of our Organization.\r\nBut the United Nations will only be what we, its\r\nMembers, allow it to be. This years General Assembly\r\nsession provides an occasion to revitalize our much\r\nneeded, but often criticized, global Organization. The\r\nSecretary-Generals excellent report on the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century provides a\r\nfirm basis for the creation of a truly modern United\r\nNations  a United Nations with maintained\r\nlegitimacy and increased credibility, greater efficiency\r\nand continued global relevance.\r\nGlobalization opens the market for those who\r\nhave the resources and instruments to benefit from it.\r\nGlobalization makes knowledge and information\r\navailable to those who have the tools and skills to make\r\nuse of the new technology. Globalization brings\r\nopportunities to improve life for all people, but it has\r\nalso led to an increasing gap between those who can\r\ntake advantage and those left behind.\r\nSafeguarding the universal and indivisible rights\r\nand values of humanity is a key responsibility for the\r\nUnited Nations in the age of globalized economy,\r\ntechnology and communications.\r\nThe world community has to do its utmost to\r\nintegrate the least developed countries into the global\r\neconomy. Solidarity and responsibility from all\r\ncountries are necessary for reaching international\r\ndevelopment targets and for contributing to an\r\nimproved standard of living for all people. Solidarity\r\nand responsibility are essential in fighting two of the\r\ngreatest threats to development and human security in\r\nour time: poverty and HIV/AIDS. We need to work\r\nwith a wide range of measures to overcome these\r\nthreats.\r\nSustained and increased official development\r\nassistance remains of vital importance. Today only four\r\ncountries, Sweden among them, meet the United\r\nNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income\r\nin development aid.\r\nBut we must also look at financing for\r\ndevelopment in a broader perspective. Domestic\r\nresources, trade, international finance and official\r\ndevelopment assistance must all be taken into account.\r\nSweden wants an integrated approach to development.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the United Nations, the\r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and others are\r\nworking together in preparing next years high-level\r\nevents on these issues.\r\nThe start of new negotiations under the WTO can\r\nbe an important contribution to growth and\r\ndevelopment. Let us together make sure that such\r\nnegotiations truly turn into a development round. The\r\nmajor trading nations have already committed\r\nthemselves to giving free market access to products\r\nfrom the least developed countries. It is time to put\r\nthese commitments into effect.\r\nThere is no contradiction between development\r\nand respect for human rights. On the contrary,\r\ndevelopment benefits from respect for the human rights\r\nand participation of all citizens, and discrimination and\r\noppression are threats to development. For women in\r\nmany parts of the world, discrimination means being\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nexcluded from participation in the economic and\r\npolitical fields; their potential contribution is lost. Two\r\nthirds of all illiterates are women. For millions of\r\nwomen, domestic violence is a daily reality. This is not\r\nin accordance with the basic values of our international\r\ncommunity and it is a major obstacle to sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The legal basis for ending discrimination\r\nexists with the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women and the new\r\nagreement of the special session in June.\r\nFor the children, next years special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly provides an excellent opportunity to\r\nset a global and concrete agenda. The Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child is the basis for this agenda to\r\nreduce forcefully maternal mortality, to give more\r\nchildren access to primary school and to promote the\r\nparticipation of young people in shaping our societies.\r\nGirls must be given the same rights and opportunities\r\nas boys. I thus welcome the Secretary-Generals new\r\nsystem-wide girls education initiative.\r\nA growing problem in many countries and\r\nregions is the traffic in human beings, especially\r\nexposing women and children to sexual exploitation\r\nand to forced labour. These criminal acts call for our\r\nimmediate attention and a forceful reaction from the\r\ninternational community. We need and actively seek\r\ncloser cooperation between Europe, Asia and others in\r\norder to develop strong and efficient measures to fight\r\nthis appalling violation of human rights.\r\nRespect for human dignity requires an end to the\r\nuse of the death penalty. This brutal and irrevocable\r\nform of punishment has no place in a modern, civilized\r\nsociety. It is time for the international community to\r\nfully recognize the most fundamental human right and\r\nabolish the death penalty.\r\nDisrespect for democracy and human rights paves\r\nthe way for crisis and conflict. National sovereignty is\r\nfirmly coupled with a Governments responsibility to\r\nprotect and promote human rights. It is the duty of the\r\ninternational community and our duty as political\r\nleaders to act and react when human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms are violated. We cannot idly\r\nstand by when people are being brutalized behind\r\nnational borders.\r\nIn many armed conflicts, deliberate terror\r\ndirected against civilians is used to create fear. Women\r\nsuffer from violence and rape. Children are denied their\r\ndignity and childhood when forced to become soldiers.\r\nMen are imprisoned in concentration camps, forced to\r\ntake sides or killed. Lives and families are ruined and\r\nthe perpetrators often go unpunished. Sierra Leone is\r\none example, Kosovo another.\r\nStrengthening international law and humanitarian\r\nlaw does increase the protection of the individual. It\r\nalso creates confidence amongst people, since it\r\ndemonstrates that a culture of impunity will not be\r\ntolerated. A good example was the decision by the\r\nSecurity Council to set up a special court to try those\r\nresponsible for war crimes during the conflict in Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nThe establishment of an International Criminal\r\nCourt will give us a safer and more just world.\r\nSuspected perpetrators of crimes against humanity can\r\nand will be tried in accordance with international law\r\nwhenever national courts are unable or unwilling to do\r\nso. There is a strong need for joint and early action to\r\nmake the International Criminal Court operational.\r\nThe past year saw a new honesty in drawing\r\nconclusions from previous mistakes and I want to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for having initiated\r\nthe studies of our failures in Bosnia and Rwanda. The\r\nlessons learned from the chilling reports on the\r\nmassacre in Srebrenica and on the genocide in Rwanda,\r\nas well as from the senseless terror in East Timor, must\r\nbe put to constructive use for the future.\r\nNational sovereignty must not be used as an\r\nexcuse to prevent the United Nations from taking\r\nnecessary measures when fundamental humanitarian\r\nvalues are at stake. It is our common responsibility to\r\nmake sure that commitments are made and that the\r\nresources for peace operations are available when\r\nneeded. My Government warmly welcomes the\r\nrecommendations in the Brahimi report, for example\r\nconcerning core funding for United Nations\r\nHeadquarters support for peacekeeping operations. By\r\nimplementing the many recommendations in the report,\r\nthe United Nations capacity to act will be significantly\r\nstrengthened.\r\nIf the Security Council cannot act in an urgent\r\nsituation, due to a veto or the threat of a veto, its\r\ncredibility and its legitimacy suffer. Necessary action\r\nought not to be hindered or blocked by a veto. Now is\r\nthe time for the permanent members to agree on a\r\nmoratorium on the use of the veto.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nThe credibility of the Security Council is of vital\r\ninterest not only to its members, but to the United\r\nNations membership at large. All efforts should be\r\nmade to use the Security Council as a forum for\r\nnegotiations and decisions in order to avoid not only\r\nthe unnecessary threat of or use of the veto, but also\r\nunilateral action whereby the Council is circumvented.\r\nA modern United Nations requires a Security Council\r\nthat reflects the realities of todays international\r\nrelations. The Council should therefore be enlarged to\r\nmake room for an increased representation of\r\ncountries, not least from the developing world. We\r\nshould also be prepared to periodically review the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council. At stake is the\r\nglobal relevance of the Security Council in a world\r\nvastly different from that of 1945.\r\nThe recent developments on the Korean peninsula\r\nshow that long-lasting tension can also be challenged\r\nthrough enlightened statesmanship. But the absence of\r\narmed conflict does not equal lasting peace. It is\r\nessential to address the root causes of violent conflict\r\nby building democracy and safeguarding human rights,\r\nby promoting economic and social development and by\r\nremoving trade barriers and debt burdens.\r\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations in\r\npreventing and, if needed, managing conflicts. The\r\nUnited Nations provides legitimacy for global action,\r\nbut the United Nations alone cannot meet the needs and\r\ndemands in this area. Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional entities could be further\r\ndeveloped. Sweden believes that the civilian and\r\nmilitary capacity for crisis management and conflict\r\nprevention now being developed by the European\r\nUnion (EU) could be put to use in the future by the\r\nUnited Nations. We will continue to work for close\r\ncooperation between the EU and the United Nations on\r\nthese matters during the Swedish presidency of the EU\r\nin the spring of 2001.\r\nDuring the past year, the Security Council has\r\nplaced emphasis on early action and on the need to\r\nfocus on the prevention of violent conflicts. Sweden\r\nstrongly supports this shift towards identifying and\r\ntaking early measures. We are prepared to work with\r\nother countries to support the Secretary-General in the\r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive conflict prevention\r\nstrategy.\r\nImproved interaction between the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, other\r\nUnited Nations bodies and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, including the use of joint fact-finding\r\nmissions, will facilitate early action. Sweden would\r\nlike to see the establishment of a standing fact-finding\r\nmechanism at the disposal of the Secretary-General, as\r\na complement to Security Council missions. Such a\r\nmechanism could be utilized at an early stage in an\r\nemerging crisis situation, without undue delays.\r\nAnother part of a United Nations strategy should\r\nbe to explore and develop the link between democracy\r\nand prevention of violent conflict. Democracy offers\r\npeaceful ways of handling conflicts and different\r\ninterests. Democratization is a process in which the\r\nholding of elections should only be the first step in a\r\nlong-term international commitment. Establishing\r\npeace and democracy takes a lot more than free and\r\nfair elections, even if that is the beginning. The\r\nsanctions instrument needs to be refined to become\r\ntruly effective. By now, we have ample evidence that\r\nsweeping economic sanctions frequently do more harm\r\nthan good. The guiding principle should be to exert the\r\nstrongest possible pressure on the decision-makers,\r\nwhile no effort should be spared to avoid negative\r\neffects on civilians. Every future sanctions regime\r\nought to consist of sharp and enforceable measures,\r\ndirected against the factors that cause and fuel crisis or\r\nconflict. Sweden stands ready to contribute actively to\r\nthe debate on how this instrument of the United\r\nNations Charter can be made more efficient.\r\nTo promote disarmament and prevent the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass-destruction remains a\r\nmajor challenge for the United Nations and its Member\r\nStates. The result of this years Review Conference of\r\nthe Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\n(NPT) gives certain hope in this regard. For the first\r\ntime in many years, a consensus document on the\r\nagenda for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nwas adopted. For the first time ever, the nuclear-\r\nweapon States unconditionally pledged to totally\r\neliminate their nuclear arsenals. For the first time, a\r\nnumber of practical steps were identified for how to\r\nwork towards this goal.\r\nA world free from nuclear weapons will not be\r\nachieved overnight. Nor are these steps to be taken in a\r\ndistant future or held hostage to States perception of\r\nthe appropriate strategic balance. The momentum\r\nachieved at the NPT Conference has to be sustained.\r\nThe countries of the New Agenda Coalition will work\r\nfor the implementation of the NPT results. All States\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nought to immediately cease production of nuclear\r\nweapons and fissile material for weapons purposes.\r\nThe Conference on Disarmament should now start its\r\nwork on a ban on such material. The world\r\ncommunitys efforts to prevent the further production\r\nof nuclear weapons must not be blocked by China,\r\nIndia, Pakistan or any other State. It is high time to\r\nbring the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty into force.\r\nWe expect all States to live up to their commitments.\r\nThe United States plans for a national missile\r\ndefence system causes concern. In todays globalized\r\nworld, we must always take account of the global\r\neffects of our decisions. It is hard to see how a possible\r\nthreat, from a few States, would best be countered by a\r\nmissile shield that may or may not work, and which\r\nrisks setting off a renewed arms race, with immense\r\ncosts in terms of wasted resources and loss of human\r\nsecurity. The recent announcement by the United States\r\nadministration to postpone the decision on the national\r\nmissile defence system was therefore welcome. A more\r\nsecure world ought to be built on cooperation rather\r\nthan on isolation and confrontation. The Anti-Ballistic\r\nMissile Treaty is crucial to global security and must not\r\nbe jeopardized.\r\nA major cause of concern is also the uncontrolled\r\nand destabilizing spread of small arms and light\r\nweapons. The international conference on illicit traffic\r\nin small arms and light weapons next year will be an\r\nimportant opportunity to address the issue in a\r\ncomprehensive way. It should result in a concrete\r\naction-plan in the global, regional and national context.\r\nThe United Nations today is stronger and leaner\r\nthan three years ago when the Secretary-General\r\nlaunched his reform programme. But there is still work\r\nto be done, for example regarding the interplay\r\nbetween the main bodies of the United Nations. We\r\nshould give the Secretary-General the full authority to\r\nact in his leadership role. We support the Secretary-\r\nGenerals proposal for a shorter, more focused agenda\r\nfor the General Assembly and restructuring of its work.\r\nAnother main issue for the Millennium Assembly is to\r\nreach an agreement on the scales of assessment for the\r\nregular United Nations budget and for peacekeeping\r\noperations. While it is imperative that all members pay\r\ntheir dues on time, in full and without conditions,\r\nSweden believes that a review of United Nations\r\ncontributions should be done. The aim however must\r\nalways be a fairer distribution of the financial burden\r\namong Member States, adapted to todays realities, and\r\nwith capacity to pay as the guiding principle.\r\nThe United Nations must not be used as a\r\nscapegoat when the real problem is lack of political\r\nwill or hesitance from us Member States to provide\r\nnecessary resources. Accordingly, any call for action\r\nmust be followed by a pledge to provide the personnel\r\nor financial means.\r\nThe United Nations, with its global character and\r\nlegitimacy, can make a difference for mankind as well\r\nas for the individual. Behind the much used term\r\nglobalization there are billions of people. They want us\r\nto provide hope. They expect us to act responsibly.\r\nThey need to see concrete results. We are here,\r\nrepresenting them, on a mission to make the United\r\nNations a true guardian of human dignity.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jadranko Prlić, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nMr. Prlić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): At the\r\noutset I would like to extend my warmest\r\ncongratulations to the President on his well-deserved\r\nelection. I also wish to express our sincere appreciation\r\nto His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for his\r\ndevoted work, tireless efforts and dedication while\r\nsuccessfully presiding over the fifty-fourth United\r\nNations General Assembly.\r\nThe Millennium Summit that concluded only a\r\nfew days ago has reaffirmed the unanimous belief of\r\nthe world leaders that only together, guided by the\r\nspirit and the objectives of the founding fathers of the\r\nUnited Nations and respecting the established system\r\nof principles, norms and standards of international\r\nrelations and international law, can we successfully\r\nrespond to the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nDespite its weaknesses, imperfections, inadequate\r\nefficiency and sometimes missed opportunities, the\r\nconsequences of which were partly felt in my country,\r\nthe United Nations succeeded in maintaining global\r\nsecurity, in containing several local and regional\r\nconflicts, in preserving peace and in facilitating the\r\nnormalization of life. It has been successful in offering\r\nrelief and hope to the most unfortunate ones. Again,\r\nmy country experienced this side of the United Nations\r\nas well. In this respect, we again welcome the\r\nSrebrenica Report and subsequent Brahimi Report.\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nIf all this was achieved mostly under the\r\nconditions of the confrontations of the cold war, in a\r\nclimate of mistrust and in the century during which\r\nhumanity not only achieved the highest objectives but\r\nalso touched the lowest depths, there should be no\r\ndoubt that the United Nations can fulfil its new tasks.\r\nAddressing this Assembly on behalf of the country that\r\nin the memory of humankind is associated with the\r\neruption of the First World War  an event that was an\r\nearly omen of the entire tragedy of the twentieth\r\ncentury  I would like to express hope that at the very\r\nend of this century, after all the horrors of the Second\r\nWorld War and after the inconceivably tragic conflicts\r\nfollowing the dissolution of the Socialist Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina has\r\nexhausted all the misfortune of being at the epicentre\r\nof historic earthquakes. And I hope that, under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is ready to gain anonymity through a\r\nspeedy recovery and blessed, long-lasting and happy\r\nprogress.\r\nThe United Nations through its activities has and\r\nwill continue to influence the developments in the\r\nworld. It has to follow the rapid and very often radical\r\nchanges in international relations and to adjust\r\naccordingly and find the best ways to exercise its\r\nduties and its role. The reform of the United Nations no\r\ndoubt is a very delicate issue. But its postponement and\r\nendless debates that only maintain the status quo are an\r\neven greater issue. Furthermore, these things bring into\r\nquestion the ability of the United Nations to modernize\r\nand democratize in order to improve its capacity and\r\nefficiency. An agreement has been reached on some of\r\nthe most crucial issues regarding the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, including the increase in its\r\nmembership  both its permanent and non-permanent\r\nseats  to include the representatives of the developed\r\nand the developing countries and to provide more\r\nequitable geographical representation of the countries.\r\nI believe that by adopting this minimum of initial\r\nreforms of the Security Council and through\r\ncontinuous work on the other related issues  such as\r\nthe issue of the veto  a favourable atmosphere would\r\nbe created and this would positively influence relations\r\nwithin and all the activities of the United Nations.\r\nIn our address to the General Assembly a year\r\nago, our delegation announced that we would like to\r\nbecome a more active member of the international\r\ncommunity, primarily of the United Nations. We said\r\nthat we were determined to move from the position of\r\nthe recipient of the concern and attention of the\r\ninternational organizations and forums  a position in\r\nwhich we were placed for more or less well-known\r\nreasons  to the position of a contributor to\r\ninternational efforts. The fact that we are in a position\r\nto consider the need or even the imperative of taking a\r\nmore active and creative role, and thus a bigger share\r\nof responsibility, testifies to the trend of normalization\r\nof the situation in our country, which was ravaged by a\r\nwar only five years ago. Although small in number, an\r\nintegrated group of 13 policemen from both entities,\r\ncomprising representatives of all three constituent\r\npeoples  who only recently were fighting each\r\nother  have been deployed with the international\r\npeacekeeping force in East Timor. Furthermore, with\r\nsignificant assistance from and the endorsement of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\n(UNMIBH), efforts to form a joint unit composed of\r\nthe military from both entities are under way. Once\r\nestablished, the unit would be sent to a peacekeeping\r\nmission under the United Nations flag. We are\r\nconsidering very seriously the possibility of presenting\r\nthe candidature of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a non-\r\npermanent seat in the Security Council after the year\r\n2010. In this way, we are confirming our commitment\r\nto the stabilization and normalization of life in our\r\ncountry, and particularly our commitment to economic\r\nand democratic development. We are confident that, as\r\nearly as 10 years from now, Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nwill succeed in becoming a member of the most\r\nimportant body of the United Nations.\r\nAlthough we display courage in expressing\r\nreadiness to take a larger share of responsibility as a\r\nMember of the United Nations and of other regional\r\norganizations, we are fully aware that we still need the\r\ninternational presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, that\r\nwe still need its assistance and support in the\r\nnormalization of life, in eliminating the consequences\r\nof war and in preparing ourselves for self-sustainable\r\ndevelopment and progress. Implementation of the\r\nDayton/Paris Peace Agreement still remains the main\r\nfocus of the activities of the authorities in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina at all levels. Its implementation is also the\r\nprimary focus of the international community and its\r\nrepresentatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Imperfect\r\nas the Peace Agreement undoubtedly is, this cannot be\r\nan excuse for a lack of commitment to its\r\nimplementation. For it is exactly its consistent\r\nimplementation that can bring us closer to the point at\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nwhich it would be normal, and even unavoidable, to\r\nestablish a new framework and new directions for\r\nBosnia and Herzegovinas progress towards higher\r\nlevels of development and higher living standards.\r\nHowever, this will only be possible when the common\r\ninstitutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina become a place\r\nand an instrument for the realization of common\r\ninterests and objectives of both of its entities and of all\r\nof its constituent nations and peoples  instead of\r\nbeing a locus for very costly obstructions and\r\nconfrontations to the detriment of all, in particular\r\nthose who want to return to their homes.\r\nIn many areas throughout Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina in the past 12 months progress has been\r\nmade. This is encouraging and indicative of the fact\r\nthat in many fields of life things could advance faster\r\nand more successfully along the road towards desired\r\nand needed progress.\r\nThe return of refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons still remains the priority. There continue to be\r\ncases in which returnees have to flee their only recently\r\nrebuilt homes when faced with brutal attacks by\r\nneighbours of different ethnicities or religions. But at\r\nthe same time it is encouraging that more often the\r\nreturnees are welcomed by their neighbours and\r\noffered assistance and support. During the first six\r\nmonths of this year three times more so-called minority\r\nreturns were registered compared to the same period\r\nlast year. However, the number of returns is considered\r\nto be even larger, since not all returns have been\r\nregistered or have not been fully completed as yet. The\r\nother positive development noticed in the returns is the\r\nfact that among the returnees there are more and more\r\nyoung people and families with school-age children,\r\nwhich was not the case in the past, when only so-called\r\nelderly households returned to their homes. This\r\nprogress, of course, may be the result of improved\r\nsecurity conditions, freedom of movement, somewhat\r\nbetter infrastructure or offering assistance with the\r\nrepairing of houses or apartments; but, above all, this\r\nprogress is the result of a growing awareness on the\r\npart of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina that it is\r\nsavage, illegal and inhuman to deprive people of their\r\nsacred rights to home, life and security.\r\nReturns were also significantly increased because\r\nindicted war criminals were more successfully brought\r\nto justice and because of a more independent, more\r\nreasonable and more constructive engagement on the\r\npart of the media. Still, the role of the international\r\ncommunity in achieving all that has been mentioned \r\nin particular the role of the High Representative, the\r\nPeace Implementation Council, the United Nations\r\nMission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Stabilization\r\nForce, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe  is irreplaceable.\r\nIn this context, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express our gratitude to the members of\r\nthe Security Council for inviting the three members of\r\nthe Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina to New\r\nYork last November on the occasion of the fourth\r\nanniversary of the Dayton/Paris Peace Agreement. That\r\nvisit resulted in the adoption of the New York\r\nDeclaration. Implementation of the provisions of the\r\nDeclaration brought about major achievements: the\r\nestablishment of the State Border Service, the\r\nformation of the Secretariat of the Presidency and\r\nimprovements that facilitated the functioning of this\r\njoint institution, the reconstruction and enlargement of\r\nthe Council of Ministers, and the creation of conditions\r\nconducive to the return of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons. Also, as a related activity, the first\r\nsteps in organizing the battle against corruption have\r\nbeen taken.\r\nThe decision of the Constitutional Court of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina on the constituency of all the\r\nthree nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina will have far-\r\nreaching consequences for overall developments in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. This decision should reduce\r\nthe unique ethnic and religious apartheid and\r\ndisenfranchisement of citizens belonging to the so-\r\ncalled minority nations. Among the achievements that\r\nencourage and have a positive impact on the change of\r\nthe overall climate in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be\r\nmentioned those made in the area of the judicial\r\nsystem. Those achievements are reflected in the\r\nprofessionalization of judges and prosecutors and in\r\ntheir modernization. Through the establishment of\r\nmulti-ethnic police comprising uncompromised\r\nprofessionals, training and education of young\r\npolicemen in police academies, composition of police\r\nforces that reflect the demographic picture of the local\r\npopulation, the space for abuses is thereby narrowed,\r\nand an environment favourable to arbitrary behaviour\r\nand unpunished harassment and oppression of citizens\r\nbelonging to so called minority nations is eliminated.\r\nIt is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that\r\nsignificant efforts are being made in the promotion and\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.14\r\nprotection of human rights and civil freedoms in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina in all fields.\r\nIn the course of preparing for the World\r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, we will request\r\nthat government bodies, courts, the police force,\r\nschools and universities, non-governmental\r\norganizations, religious institutions and their leaders\r\nand distinguished individuals from different spheres of\r\nlife, challenge those who still advocate and practise\r\ndifferent forms of discrimination and intolerance and\r\nstep on human rights, freedoms and human dignity.\r\nWe, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are aware that\r\nhealing the consequences of war and post-war\r\nstagnation and removal of impediments to faster\r\nstabilization and progress rests primarily with the\r\ndomestic political leadership.\r\nWe are also aware that the future of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is in its integration into European and\r\nother institutions. The Stability Pact for south-eastern\r\nEurope has therefore been accepted as a framework\r\nconducive to regional cooperation, elimination of\r\nmistrust, strengthening of security conditions and for\r\ncatching up with missed opportunities in the spheres of\r\nhuman rights and democratic emancipation and\r\neconomic progress. Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nwholeheartedly embraces the Stability Pact as the most\r\nimportant regional endeavour so far, convinced that,\r\ndespite the slow realization of a number of projects and\r\ndespite the slower inflow of contributions, its\r\nobjectives are fully consistent with the objectives of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovinas foreign policy. The\r\nachievement of these objectives would embark us on\r\nthe road to faster integration into the Council of\r\nEurope, the European Union, the World Trade\r\nOrganization and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization. There is no doubt whatsoever that the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) should\r\nparticipate in the Stability Pact, but we share the views\r\nof those who condition its participation on the\r\nnecessary democratic changes in that country. At the\r\nsame time, we consider that the other countries of the\r\nregion should not be kept hostage by the FRY on their\r\nway to Euro-Atlantic integration. In this context, we\r\nwould like to recall that, at the early stages of the\r\nestablishment of the European Union, there was no\r\nwaiting list for the present members of the Union and\r\nthat they did not have to pass the entering examination\r\nsuccessfully and simultaneously. At this point in time,\r\nthe waiting lists and admission procedures could be\r\ncounterproductive and could encourage those forces in\r\nthe region, including in my own country, to persist in\r\ncontinuing the state of chaos and exclusion.\r\nAt the beginning of this year, the situation in the\r\nneighouring Republic of Croatia has been significantly\r\nimproved by the opposition victory in the elections. A\r\nnumber of issues that burdened the relations between\r\nthe two countries have practically been resolved, since\r\nsome of the issues were tackled in the bilateral\r\nmeetings at the highest levels immediately after the\r\nelections. The change brought about by the elections\r\nalso positively influenced the return of refugees,\r\nalthough more visible results in this area are still to\r\ncome.\r\nHowever, regrettably, there is still no\r\nimprovement in relations with the FRY and, at this\r\npoint, it is still uncertain when the improvement might\r\noccur. For sure, without democratic changes in Serbia,\r\nthe establishment of full diplomatic relations between\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the FRY could hardly\r\noccur. The democratic changes in the FRY certainly\r\nwould positively reflect on the internal relations\r\nbetween the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina as\r\nwell as on overall relations in the region. The\r\ndemocratic changes in the Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nneighbourhood have certainly cut off the influx of\r\nexported elements of destabilization and crisis. I have\r\nalready referred to the positive example of changes in\r\nCroatia.\r\nWe, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, must gather the\r\ncourage and strength to face our reality and to choose\r\nthe path and the direction that would lead us speedily\r\ntowards the achievements that would compensate for\r\nthe decade of suffering, deprivation and missed\r\nopportunities. In the process of making this clear and\r\nrational choice, we would like to count on the\r\nunreserved support of the international community, and\r\non a rather sooner than later integration into Euro-\r\nAtlantic institutions. We have to say that this\r\nintegration is already very much behind schedule and\r\nwe do not have a lot of time to waste.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
