(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Lloyd Axworthy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nCanada.\r\nMr. Axworthy (Canada): I would like to begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly. Your experience and wisdom\r\nwill doubtless guide us in carrying out the important\r\nwork ahead.\r\nAs we all know, that work is to immediately and\r\nresolutely transform the high hopes of the Millennium\r\nSummit into a better reality for the peoples for whom\r\nthe United Nations was founded.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThis means assuming responsibility for our\r\nactions and our inaction. It also means that\r\nGovernments must be ready to assume their\r\nresponsibility for their citizens.\r\nLast week our leaders delivered here a message\r\nof hope and determination. Their words clearly showed\r\nthat we all need the United Nations. The United\r\nNations is the only organization that embodies\r\nuniversal values; that offers a global forum to address\r\ncommon problems; and that is on the front line around\r\nthe world fighting for people.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThere was another message from the Summit\r\nabout whether the United Nations is keeping up with\r\nthe times; about whether we, the Member States —\r\ncustodians of the Organization and guardians of the\r\nCharter — have the political will to support renewal\r\nand modernization.\r\nWhen the lights turned off last Friday night here\r\nin New York, did other lights go on around the\r\nworld — in our Chancery offices, Parliamentary\r\nassemblies and Cabinet meeting rooms — to illuminate\r\nthe way forward? Are we all, each in our own way,\r\nasking how we can change our ways to better help the\r\nUnited Nations manage a new global agenda?\r\nClearly, globalization has brought unprecedented\r\nbenefits and possibilities. But it also clearly brings new\r\nrisks to people in all our countries. Many of those new\r\nrisks cross State lines, while most violent conflict now\r\noccurs within States’ borders. In both cases, the impact\r\nis felt directly by ordinary people.\r\nYet the debate within the United Nations remains\r\ndriven — and too often circumscribed — by rigid\r\nnotions of sovereignty and narrow conceptions of\r\nnational interest. And action by the United Nations\r\nremains hampered by inflexible institutional structures\r\nthat have become increasingly inward-looking, driven\r\nby their own interests rather than by those they were\r\ndesigned to serve.\r\nThe Secretary-General has, with a courage rarely\r\nseen in public life, given us a vision of a way forward.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nIt is a vision that serves the world’s people, and one\r\nthat resonates with them, even though it may aggravate\r\nsome of their Governments. He has challenged us to\r\nfollow his lead, to adopt a people-centred approach to\r\ninternational relations, to move this Organization from\r\nthe sidelines to the forefront of change.\r\nThis is not a new agenda for Canada. Indeed, over\r\nthe past five years, promoting human security has been\r\nthe focus of our own approach to our changing world.\r\nAnd it has been encouraging to see the shift in attitude\r\ntoward a more realistic sense of what it means to be\r\nsecure in the world as an individual.\r\nOur leaders endorsed this new vision in their\r\nSummit Declaration. But if we have truly come to the\r\nunderstanding that security means more than protecting\r\nborders, we must now act to turn last week’s good\r\nintentions into effective action. This means taking\r\nresponsibility to adapt our institutions, broaden\r\nparticipation in their functioning, and increase\r\ntransparency and accountability to make a tangible\r\ndifference for the people we represent.\r\nIt also means responsible, accountable global\r\nbehaviour, sharing and protecting the common space\r\nthat sustains life.\r\nAggressive pursuit of the global arms control and\r\ndisarmament agenda is the ultimate responsible act.\r\nOur generation built the nuclear arsenals that are\r\noutmoded and rotting; we produced the chemical\r\nweapons that poison people; and today we still make\r\nand distribute the small arms that are found\r\neverywhere: in the hands of children, the arsenals of\r\ndrug dealers and the garrisons of guerrilla fighters.\r\nBut we have also had a certain foresight to begin\r\nbuilding a system of international obligations and\r\nprinciples to contain such behaviour. We now have to\r\nvalidate and implement these instruments. Above all,\r\nwe must do nothing to damage them.\r\nCertainly, Governments must prepare for the\r\ndefence of their people. Responsible defence is an\r\nelement of responsible government. But surely, our\r\nresponsibility to defend our citizens begins not with the\r\ndevelopment of new weapons systems, but by\r\ndismantling old ones: by ratifying the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT); by joining the 104\r\nStates parties to the Ottawa Treaty on landmines; by\r\nimplementing the international non-proliferation norms\r\nand disarmament obligations embodied in the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); by\r\ndeveloping comprehensive action plans to stop the\r\nproliferation of small arms and missile technology.\r\nThe collective action of States working for the\r\nlong-term security of their people is clearly the\r\npreferable path. But where States are unable, or\r\nunwilling, to protect their citizens, the United Nations,\r\nand in particular the Security Council, has a special\r\nresponsibility to act.\r\nToday, most wars are fought within failed States.\r\nIn these wars, it is the victimization of civilians that is\r\nthe motive, the means and the manifestation of a\r\nconflict.\r\nIf the Council is to acquit itself of its\r\nresponsibility to these people, their protection must be\r\nat the core of its work, not at its periphery.\r\nThis is the agenda that Canada has brought to the\r\nSecurity Council over the past two years. It has not\r\nbeen an easy task, but I would like to acknowledge that\r\nthe Security Council is meeting the new challenges. In\r\nrecent months, the Council’s work has increasingly\r\nfocused on the protection of civilians, with action in\r\nthe areas of AIDS, physical protection, war-affected\r\nchildren and sanctions reform. The Council has\r\nrecognized that dealing with these issues is critical to\r\nbuilding effective peace-support operations, and has\r\nembodied this recognition in recent resolutions. Today,\r\nwe are providing members a checklist, a checklist of\r\nresponsible action in the Security Council.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Brahimi report also proposes a plan of\r\naction. It is a comprehensive strategy for strengthening\r\nthe United Nations capacity to help people. Canada\r\nsupports the panel’s findings. We will be its strongest\r\nadvocate and can be counted upon to work tirelessly to\r\nbuild the political support required to implement both\r\nthe spirit and the letter of its recommendations.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nBy far the most difficult challenge in protecting\r\ncivilians in armed conflict is in situations where abuse\r\nis most severe: genocide, war crimes, crimes against\r\nhumanity, massive and systematic violations of human\r\nrights and humanitarian law which cause widespread\r\nsuffering, loss of life and abuse.\r\nWe need a new form of deterrence against such\r\nforms of behaviour. The establishment of an\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), which makes\r\nimpunity illegal and which holds individuals directly\r\naccountable for their actions, is that deterrent. And if\r\nits power to deter the abuse of people fails, the Statute\r\nprovides both a basis and a structure to take concrete\r\nlegal action to redress injustice.\r\nThe Court’s Statute provides us with a unique\r\nopportunity to fix one of the worst failings in the\r\ninternational system. Today I appeal to every\r\nGovernment here that has not done so to sign the Rome\r\nStatute by December and to ratify it on an urgent basis,\r\nso that the world’s people can finally have the justice\r\nthey deserve.\r\nCanada seeks to systematically put in place the\r\nbuilding blocks for a new type of international system,\r\none that is inspired and guided by the United Nations\r\nCharter, but that is also prepared to deal with the\r\nunderside and underworld of globalization.\r\nOf course, prevention is the best form of\r\nintervention. But when preventive measures fail; when\r\nthe quiet diplomatic efforts and the targeted sanctions\r\ndo not work; when the fact-finders find facts too\r\nhorrendous to imagine; then there must be recourse to\r\nmore robust action.\r\nThe question of intervention in these instances,\r\nincluding, as a last resort, the use of military force, is\r\nfraught with difficulty and controversy. Many would\r\nsweep it under the rug as too divisive, too difficult, too\r\ndamaging to the status quo. But Rwanda, Cambodia,\r\nSrebrenica and Kosovo remind us that it is important to\r\nfocus on this question. It would be easy to pretend that\r\nthe humanitarian tragedies associated with these places\r\nare a thing of the past. It would be easy, but it would be\r\nwrong. There is no certainty that similar atrocities will\r\nnot happen again. Indeed, the opposite is more likely.\r\nThe spiral into extremes of human suffering cannot\r\nalways be constrained.\r\nReading the editorial page of The New York Times\r\non Tuesday, 12 September, we realize that some would\r\nhave us believe that the United Nations Charter was\r\nwritten only to protect States and State interests:\r\n“intervening in civil conflicts takes the United\r\nNations a step too far”.\r\nI disagree. I say that in the face of egregious human\r\nsuffering it is a step in the right direction.\r\nNothing so threatens the United Nations very future as\r\nthis apparent contradiction between principle and\r\npower; between people’s security and Governments’\r\ninterests; between, in short, humanitarian intervention\r\nand State sovereignty.\r\nLast fall I stood before this body and argued that\r\nthe United Nations Charter was written for people. Our\r\ncollective agenda here is not the nation States’ agenda,\r\nor the ministers’ agenda, or the diplomats’ agenda. It is\r\nthe people’s agenda. Indeed, “We the peoples” are the\r\nopening words of the Charter. Those who would seek\r\nto hide behind that document to justify inaction need\r\nonly to read its preamble to reacquaint themselves with\r\nits original intent.\r\nSecretary-General Annan has challenged us to\r\nrethink what it means to be responsible, sovereign\r\nStates. Canada has responded by creating an\r\nindependent international commission on intervention\r\nand State sovereignty. Its purpose is to contribute to\r\nbuilding a broader understanding of the issue, and to\r\nfoster a global political consensus on how to move\r\nforward. The commission will be led by two co-\r\nchairpersons — one from the developing and one from\r\nthe developed world — with the participation of a wide\r\nrange of representatives of Governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations from all regions and under\r\nthe overall guidance of an advisory board composed of\r\nministers, former ministers and distinguished\r\npractitioners from the academic, humanitarian and\r\nlegal fields.\r\nThe commission will undertake its work during\r\nthis Millennium Assembly year, and will present its\r\nrecommendations in 12 months’ time. I ask those\r\npresent here in the Assembly Hall to join in this\r\nenterprise, difficult as it may be, so that we can seek to\r\nreconcile these concepts to find the space that we can\r\nall share.\r\nIt is difficult, but it is not impossible. We have\r\ndone it before. Thirteen years ago, the Brundtland\r\nCommission’s report, “Our Common Future”, took two\r\nseemingly contradictory ideas — economic\r\ndevelopment and the protection of the environment —\r\nand out of that contradiction forged a synthesis called\r\nsustainable development. That new concept\r\nfundamentally changed the way in which the world\r\nthinks about those issues, and its work informs our\r\nthinking to this very day. It is Canada’s hope that this\r\nnew commission can diffuse the anxiety that surrounds\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nthe issues of intervention and sovereignty by building a\r\nsimilar bridge between our current notions of these\r\nconcepts, and in so doing help to define the way ahead\r\nfor Governments and the United Nations to tackle the\r\nmost challenging international dilemma of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nHowever, the responsibility no longer stops just\r\nwith Governments. The private sector must also take its\r\nresponsibility for the communities on which it depends\r\nfor its business. Ethical business is good business. The\r\nmany companies that have joined the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Global Compact with Business recognize\r\nthat profit made on the backs of exploited and abused\r\nchildren — by gun-running, drug dealing or conflict\r\ndiamonds — is no longer acceptable. In the globalized\r\neconomy, the world’s people are the ultimate\r\nshareholders. If they do not profit, no one will. We\r\nmust therefore work on all of these fronts and with all\r\nof these new players to build a future where human\r\nsecurity is universally respected and protected. In the\r\nmeantime, there are steps that we can take to protect\r\nthe most vulnerable.\r\nTo build a world that values human security we\r\nmust start with concern and action for those who will\r\ninherit it. It is fitting, therefore, that in this year of\r\nfresh resolve the future of our children is a key element\r\nof the agenda, particularly through the special session\r\non children that is to be held next year. Nowhere is the\r\nsafety and well-being of children more at risk than in\r\nconflict situations. Children should have no part in war.\r\nYet today they are among its main victims, counting in\r\nthe millions.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nFour years ago, Graça Machel brought attention\r\nto the horrific plight of war-affected children. Since\r\nthen, action has been taken too reduce their suffering,\r\nmost notably with the appointment of Olara Otunnu as\r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Representative for\r\nChildren and Armed Conflict and, more recently, with\r\nthe historic agreement last January on the Optional\r\nProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\non the involvement of children in armed conflict.\r\nThis week, with Graça Machel as honorary\r\nChairperson, Canada is hosting in Winnipeg the\r\nInternational Conference on War-Affected Children.\r\nThis meeting, the first of its kind, brings together more\r\nthan 130 Governments, 60 non-governmental\r\norganizations and private sector groups, international\r\norganizations and young people from every region of\r\nthe world.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI am pleased that so many ministers and senior\r\nofficials from the Organization will join us in\r\nWinnipeg this weekend. I encourage those not already\r\nrepresented to attend.\r\nThe aim of the conference is twofold: to\r\nformulate a comprehensive, global action plan and to\r\nforge the necessary political will to implement it.\r\nTogether, we hope it will help children traumatized by\r\nwar, and ultimately eliminate their involvement and\r\nvictimization in conflict.\r\nEarlier this week in Winnipeg, as we opened the\r\nconference, a young Ugandan girl named Grace spoke\r\nto me, at a meeting of young people affected by war,\r\nabout her experience as a child soldier. Her story was\r\none of victimization and chilling brutality. Her belief\r\nthat the international community could help her and\r\nothers like her was touching and inspiring. Her plea for\r\nus to do so is the essence of the Organization’s\r\nvocation. Indeed, it is one of our basic responsibilities.\r\nFor me, that young woman’s simple appeal makes it\r\nclear that we have no option but to be ready, to be\r\nwilling, and to be able to forge a United Nations for the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIn view of the daunting challenges ahead, any\r\nattempt to retreat, to shut out the world or to turn away\r\nfrom international engagement would be to follow a\r\ndangerous path that is neither practical nor desirable.\r\nThe truth is that we share a common humanity. The\r\nreality is that we are linked by the forces of history into\r\na common destiny. The fact is that the answers to our\r\nproblems lie in strengthening, not diminishing, global\r\ncooperation and global solutions.\r\nIn today’s world, the security of States and the\r\nsecurity of people are indivisible. Providing for that\r\nsecurity is a necessary precondition for success in other\r\nimportant endeavours, such as advancing economic aid\r\nand trade development. In this new century, too many\r\npeople like Grace are still subject to the worst of the\r\npast century: to the scourge of war, to human rights\r\nabuses and to too few prospects for social progress and\r\na better standard of living. Yet the hopes contained in\r\nthe United Nations Charter still have meaning for them,\r\nand indeed relevance for all of us. Fulfilling its\r\naspirations is our enduring goal and fundamental\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nresponsibility. With human security as our guide, let us\r\nmake it our focus as we renew our commitment to the\r\npurposes of the United Nations and to a better future\r\nfor Grace and for all the people that we represent.\r\nThis goal is a responsibility that I have been\r\nhonoured to share with many of those present here over\r\nthe past five years. It is a goal that we must all\r\ncontinue to strive towards — whatever our position in\r\nlife, whatever our title — in order to ensure that this\r\nsystem we have built does not surrender to the cynics\r\nwho offer no alternatives, or to the game players who\r\nparalyse the transcendent purposes of the United\r\nNations for simple transitory diplomatic points.\r\nOnly in so doing will we truly live up to the\r\npromise contained in the Charter: to serve the majesty\r\nof the people and to make this Organization work for\r\nthem.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Jamaica, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Paul Robertson.\r\nMr. Robertson (Jamaica): Sir, I offer you\r\nJamaica’s warmest congratulations as you assume the\r\nhigh honour of the presidency of the Millennium\r\nAssembly of the United Nations.\r\nAt the same time, I wish to express our\r\nappreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia, who, by his\r\nastute and judicious leadership, brought to a successful\r\nconclusion the work of the fifty-fourth session.\r\nI also take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu, a\r\nfellow small island State, to the United Nations family.\r\nWe meet in the wake of the historic gathering of\r\nworld leaders last week, when the international\r\ncommunity sought to redefine and articulate a common\r\nvision for the future of all its citizens. We now have the\r\nopportunity — indeed, the responsibility — to evaluate\r\njust how far we have come in the mission we set for\r\nourselves through this Organization; to address\r\nhonestly our shortcomings in commitment and action;\r\nand to examine practical, realistic strategies that will\r\nresult in measurable progress in areas identified for\r\nurgent action.\r\nThe Secretary-General, whom we commend for\r\nhis stewardship during the past year, has urged us to\r\nconsider a world in the future free from poverty.\r\nIndeed, promoting development that ensures the well-\r\nbeing of all peoples is one of the fundamental goals of\r\nthis Organization. However, a review of our efforts to\r\nachieve this ideal shows uneven progress through an\r\nincreasingly diffused institutional structure.\r\nOver the past decade, we have sought to refocus\r\nand articulate the development agenda by addressing\r\nkey issues in a series of special global conferences.\r\nThrough the respective political commitments and\r\nplans of action which we agreed to implement, we have\r\nsought to devise a network of policies and programmes\r\nto promote people-centred, sustainable development.\r\nYet economic strategies embracing these goals\r\nhave brought little tangible benefit to the majority of\r\ncitizens of the international community. Nearly half of\r\nthe world’s people languish in extreme poverty, and\r\nstill more remain on the fringes of the global economy.\r\nDevelopment efforts have been frustrated by the\r\nchallenges posed by globalization and trade\r\nliberalization. Sustainable development ultimately\r\ninvolves an enhanced capacity for income and\r\nemployment generation, as well as the provision of\r\nequitable health, education and other social benefits.\r\nBut this cannot be achieved without economic growth\r\nand expansion. It is this opportunity that globalization,\r\nwhich indeed carries the potential, has so far failed to\r\ndeliver to the majority of developing countries.\r\nFor small island States like Jamaica, there is\r\nanother dimension to the development challenge. This\r\nis because of the well-known economic limitations of\r\nsize, market and resource base, a fragile ecosystem and\r\nsusceptibility to natural disasters. Decades of\r\ninvestment in infrastructure and industry can be wiped\r\nout during a single hurricane, destroying the economy\r\nand diverting resources to reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation for a number of years.\r\nSmall economies attempting to compete\r\neffectively in the international trading system are just\r\nas vulnerable. There is a need for an urgent review of\r\nthe inequities in the global trading system whereby\r\nselective application of the regulations permits\r\ndeveloped countries to maintain protectionist policies\r\nand subsidies that work against developing country\r\nexports, while stripping the more vulnerable of\r\npreferential market access. We are deeply concerned\r\nthat a mechanism established to promote free trade for\r\ngrowth and development could be so manipulated that\r\nit exposes the smallest and weakest to a hostile trading\r\nenvironment while removing their means of survival.\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nSpecial and differential treatment provisions have not\r\nbeen implemented, and the request for duty-free, quota-\r\nfree treatment for the least developed countries has not\r\nbeen agreed to.\r\nWe are particularly disappointed that, in ongoing\r\nnegotiations to reach agreement on a marketing regime\r\nfor bananas that is compatible with the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO), we have found little flexibility,\r\nno empathy and an unwillingness to compromise on the\r\npart of those challenging the regime. Meanwhile,\r\nimplementation of the WTO panel ruling has resulted\r\nin a dramatic loss of export markets in some Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) States, spiralling\r\nunemployment, increasing poverty and many other\r\nsocial ills. For there can be no development without\r\ngrowth, and no growth without trade.\r\nDeteriorating terms of trade adversely affect the\r\nbalance of payments, exacerbating external debt. Many\r\ndeveloping countries continue to experience severe\r\ndebt burdens, and, in some cases, the debt problem has\r\nworsened over the past decade, trapping those\r\ncountries in a vicious circle of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. We must address the debilitating\r\neffect of debt servicing, which undermines growth\r\nprospects and compromises governments’ capacity to\r\nfinance basic social programmes. The international\r\ncommunity should implement the debt-relief schemes\r\nalready agreed to and design new mechanisms\r\nappropriate to different countries’ circumstances.\r\nThe globalization of trade, finance and swiftly\r\nadvancing information technology will present\r\nunprecedented opportunities well into the twenty-first\r\ncentury. For developing countries, however, the\r\nchallenges of the trading system, limited access to\r\ninternational financial flows, a crippling debt burden\r\nand a low capacity to assimilate information\r\ntechnology will prevent meaningful participation in the\r\ninternational marketplace. Hence, the widening gap\r\nbetween rich and poor nations in the face of unlimited\r\nopportunity is the disturbing irony that we now\r\ncontemplate.\r\nIf we are now to lay the foundation for a world\r\nfree from poverty, then a new ethos in global\r\ngovernance must prevail: one that gives more than lip\r\nservice to the development aspirations of developing\r\ncountries; one that addresses responsibly the need for\r\neconomic adjustment, reform and closer monitoring of\r\nthe international financial infrastructure; and one that\r\npromotes greater coordination and cooperation between\r\nthe major institutions and intergovernmental\r\norganizations responsible for international trade,\r\nfinance and development.\r\nThat such cooperation is already being explored\r\nis indeed encouraging. But we will need serious\r\ncommitment. Until now, there have been no parallel\r\ndiscussions on reforming the international financial\r\narchitecture and the international trading system. The\r\nwork of the Preparatory Committee for the High-level\r\nInternational Intergovernmental Event on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, including consultations with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, has progressed uneasily, leaving\r\nuncertainty regarding the outcome and likely success of\r\nthat landmark meeting. We will wait to see whether\r\nmeaningful World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nparticipation will take place, as we consider it\r\nimportant to successful deliberations.\r\nOf course, we applaud the evolving relationship\r\nbetween the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. Each brings to the\r\npartnership its unique characteristics and strengths,\r\nwhich should make for successful collaboration.\r\nPerhaps similar relationships might also be established\r\nwith the World Trade Organization. That cooperation,\r\nlong overdue, reinforces the integral role that we\r\nbelieve the United Nations should play in key\r\ninternational decision-making on all issues which\r\naffect sustainable human development. We look\r\nforward to the extension of this cooperation beyond the\r\nco-financing of development projects, towards the\r\nharmonization of mechanisms and policies.\r\nThe importance of South-South cooperation as an\r\neffective instrument for the promotion of development\r\namong developing countries cannot be\r\noveremphasized. The historic meeting of the leaders of\r\nthe South, held at Havana this year, strengthened our\r\ncommitment to forge a common strategy for our future,\r\nsharing resources, expertise and best practices in\r\npartnership with one another. We strongly urge the\r\ncontinued strengthening of mechanisms that advance\r\nSouth-South relations and promote self-reliance.\r\nIncreasingly, we must look to each other for our\r\nsurvival in the existing global environment.\r\nWe continue to look to the organs and agencies of\r\nthe United Nations system to play a central role in\r\nsupporting and advancing the development efforts of\r\nMember States. We are deeply concerned at the decline\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nin contributions to core resources for operational\r\nactivities, and at the effect this has had in the\r\nnarrowing and re-ordering of priorities in programme\r\ndelivery. It is impossible to reconcile the contraction in\r\ncore contributions with the donor community’s\r\nexpressed commitment to multilateral development\r\nassistance. The capacity of United Nations funds and\r\nprogrammes to maintain current levels of programme\r\ndelivery is a matter deserving the urgent attention of\r\nMember States. We take this opportunity to place on\r\nrecord our appreciation for the valuable work of United\r\nNations operational agencies in Jamaica.\r\nNext year’s special session of the General\r\nAssembly on children will give the international\r\ncommunity an opportunity to renew its commitment\r\nand to consider further action to improve the quality of\r\nlife for the world’s children in the next decade.\r\nThe role of the United Nations as defender of\r\ninternational peace and security has undergone major\r\ntransformation in the past decade. As inter-State\r\ntensions dissolved with the end of the cold war, civil\r\nconflicts developed in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe\r\nto take their place. The Security Council is now\r\nsearching to adjust and redefine an effective strategy to\r\ndeal with the new imperatives of peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building. This has meant seeking a delicate\r\nbalance between respect for sovereignty and the urgent\r\nneed for humanitarian intervention.\r\nIn too many cases the resolution of conflict has\r\nremained elusive owing to political ambitions or to\r\nracial or ethnic intolerance. Furthermore, the brutality\r\nand violence of conflict have often taken their toll on\r\ninnocent civilians and children, creating still more new\r\nchallenges with an increasing number of refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons. Humanitarian intervention\r\nin such cases is imperative.\r\nThe effectiveness of peacekeeping missions is\r\nunder scrutiny in the face of sharply escalating\r\npeacekeeping budgets. Rather than waiting until\r\nconflicts spiral out of control, we need to place more\r\nemphasis on conflict prevention. Jamaica therefore\r\nstrongly supports the formulation of a comprehensive\r\nUnited Nations strategy to address the root causes of\r\nconflict.\r\nIt is time that we acknowledged that economic\r\ndeprivation and social injustice lead to political and\r\neconomic instability. Therefore, effective conflict\r\nprevention, peacekeeping and peace building must\r\nincorporate a development component, and provide for\r\nthe strengthening of civil institutions, particularly in\r\npost-conflict reconstruction.\r\nAnd we must not forget the importance of\r\nadequately equipping the United Nations machinery to\r\nensure robust intervention at every stage of the\r\npeacekeeping process, particularly for rapid\r\ndeployment when necessary. This should also include\r\nresources adequate to ensure the safety of our troops\r\ndeployed in missions across the world. It is the very\r\nleast that we owe them. Jamaica pays tribute today to\r\nthose who have paid the ultimate price in the service of\r\npeace.\r\nThe deadly flow of illegal small arms around the\r\nworld continues unabated, sustained by greed and\r\nlawlessness. This illicit arms trade contributes\r\nsignificantly to the escalation and perpetuation of\r\nviolence in conflict and post-conflict areas,\r\nundermining peacekeeping operations and frustrating\r\nefforts at disarmament, demobilization and the\r\nrestoration of civil order. But this phenomenon is not\r\nunique to countries in a state of war. The illegal traffic\r\nin weapons is also linked to the illicit trade in\r\nnarcotics, and this undermines stable democracies like\r\nJamaica, destroying the social fabric of our\r\ncommunities.\r\nThis situation simply cannot stand. Urgent action\r\nis needed. Global interdependence warrants collective\r\naction to stem the flow of these guns from producer to\r\nreceiving States. The responsibility to curb this illicit\r\ntraffic cannot rest with the receiving States alone.\r\nJamaica looks with anticipation to the convening\r\nof the first International Conference on the Illicit Trade\r\nin Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects\r\nnext year. It is our hope that this meeting will address\r\ncomprehensively and decisively national, regional and\r\ninternational measures to regulate and control the legal\r\nmanufacture, acquisition and transfer of small arms;\r\nmeasures related to the marking, registration and\r\ntracing of these weapons; and mechanisms for the\r\nsystematic exchange of information.\r\nThe transhipment of nuclear and other hazardous\r\nwaste through the Caribbean Sea poses yet another\r\nkind of danger to the security of small island States of\r\nthe subregion. The Caribbean Community has\r\nrepeatedly expressed concern at the threat to the fragile\r\nmarine and coastal environment of the Caribbean posed\r\nby this continued practice. A single nuclear accident in\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nthis semi-enclosed sea would have consequences we\r\ndare not even contemplate.\r\nThis concern was again brought to the attention\r\nof the international community during the 2000 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on Nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation, held earlier this year. We look\r\nforward to cooperating with like-minded States, and we\r\npropose to work towards ensuring that a regime is\r\nestablished for liability and compensation to our\r\ncountries in the event of an accident.\r\nOn Friday, 8 September, Jamaica signed the\r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We\r\nnow look forward to the contribution that the Court\r\nwill ultimately make to the strengthening of\r\ninternational jurisprudence, by addressing the serious\r\ncrimes of global concern committed by individuals\r\nwho hitherto escaped the reach of the law.\r\nWe are also very pleased to report that the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority has completed its\r\ndrafting of the Mining Code. This marks an important\r\nfirst step in the process toward the full establishment of\r\noperations of the Authority that will ultimately enable\r\nall nations to share in exploitation of the resources of\r\nthe seabed. Jamaica encourages wider participation in\r\nthe work of the International Seabed Authority and\r\nurges Member States to act to ensure its continued\r\nfinancial viability.\r\nWhile the United Nations is by no means perfect,\r\nwe still meet here because we hold an enduring faith in\r\nthe principles and ideals that it represents. We are\r\nconvinced that it remains the best forum for dialogue\r\nand resolution of disputes. Let us now face the future\r\ntogether responsibly, with full respect for the needs,\r\naspirations and rights of our fellow man. This may well\r\nbe difficult to achieve, but shared objectives, shared\r\ncommitment and shared responsibilities will ensure a\r\nbetter world for all humankind.\r\nAs we contemplate the challenges for the future,\r\nlet us resolve to begin a new dialogue within the\r\nUnited Nations system to forge a global partnership for\r\npeace, democracy and economic progress.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Oskaras Jusys, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Republic of Lithuania.\r\nMr. Jusys (Lithuania): I would like to say,\r\nMr. President, that I take special pleasure in seeing you\r\npreside over this Millennium Assembly session. I wish\r\nto assure you of my delegation’s full support in all your\r\nendeavours. As one of the Vice-Presidents of the past\r\nsession, I want to convey my special appreciation to\r\nmy colleague and your predecessor, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Namibia, Theo-Ben Gurirab. I would also\r\nlike to extend my gratitude to the Secretary-General for\r\npresenting his report “We the Peoples” to the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nAllow me also to convey my delegation’s warm\r\nwelcome to Tuvalu as a new member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt is both remarkable and profoundly logical that\r\nin the beginning of the new millennium high\r\nrepresentatives of almost 200 nations have gathered for\r\none sole purpose — to comprehend challenges of the\r\ncontemporary world. The fact that we all have gathered\r\nhere, representing all regions of the world, cultures and\r\nreligions, means that we all share the belief in the\r\nvalue, viability and potential of the United Nations.\r\nHeads of State and Government, during the course of\r\nthe Millennium Summit, have guided us towards\r\nstrengthening the United Nations, including its central\r\nrole in peacekeeping and poverty eradication. Our task\r\nnow is to act upon their guidance.\r\nGlobalization, the digital revolution and the\r\ntriumph of free trade have transformed the world into a\r\nvibrant world economy. Interdependence within the\r\nworld economy emphasizes collective problems and\r\nsolutions. Thus, the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and\r\nmany other international organizations are\r\nindispensable mechanisms in achieving stable peace, in\r\nassisting in shaping the course of development, and in\r\nensuring that the world economy provides benefits for\r\nall.\r\nNever has the world been so well off. Yet, never\r\nhas it been confronted with so many problems on the\r\nglobal scale. The nature of threats has entirely changed.\r\nThe phenomena are so complex that they defy easy\r\ngeneralization. These phenomena comprise extreme\r\npoverty and marginalization of entire communities;\r\ngross violations of human rights; ethnic conflicts and\r\ngenocide; arms proliferation; terrorism; and\r\nenvironmental degradation.\r\nNo effort should be spared to free people from\r\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. The goals\r\nadopted at the Millennium Summit are challenging.\r\nAssistance, new trade arrangements, and debt relief\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nwill hardly constitute a panacea, unless necessary and\r\nstrong commitments to poverty reduction, economic\r\nequality, combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic and\r\nsupporting education are reflected, first and foremost,\r\nin national policies of individual States, and\r\nconcurrently on the agendas of international\r\norganizations. Good health, literacy, and education are\r\ncritical assets for economic development. Human\r\ncapital, combined with a high level of economic\r\nequality, good governance, and abiding by the rule of\r\nlaw can really make a difference. This is the course we\r\nstrongly uphold if we aim at reducing by half the level\r\nof extreme poverty by 2015 and achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe realities are that most of the economic\r\nthinking and ruling is being done within the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization or\r\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OSCE), and a fully coordinated\r\napproach to the problems of peace and development\r\nshould be sought between these organizations and\r\ninstitutions and the United Nations.\r\nWe have yet to learn how to manage the spin-offs\r\nof globalization and how best to make use of\r\ninternational mechanisms to address new forms of\r\nthreats. Better yet, prevention is preferable to cure. For\r\nreally effective prevention, a broader definition of\r\nsecurity is vital and must encompass pressing\r\neconomic and social problems. The root causes of\r\nconflicts should be addressed as a fundamental part of\r\nefforts to establish secure peace and stability.\r\nShould preventative strategies yield no results,\r\nthe United Nations must have a truly effective\r\npeacekeeping capacity at its disposal. Lithuania will\r\nsupport every effort to fix structural deficiencies within\r\nthe United Nations and adequately to staff and finance\r\nrelevant departments. Provided the determination,\r\nresources, capacity and willingness are available, I\r\nbelieve, humanitarian catastrophes and crises can be\r\naverted. Proposals to improve the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping capacity and performance, especially\r\nthose contained in the Brahimi report, have been\r\nwidely endorsed by our leaders. Now we have to work\r\non it with a view to shifting the historically prevailing\r\nconception of peacekeeping as an ad hoc job to one of\r\nthe core functions of the United Nations.\r\nGreat challenges to the new international way of\r\ncontaining and resolving ethnic conflicts await in\r\nAfrica. A prospective strategy could be to encourage\r\nand assist regional organizations, especially the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States; involve civil\r\nsociety and the business community; and, most notably,\r\nenhance the United Nations, especially the Security\r\nCouncil’s capacity to act well in advance, before a\r\ncrisis gets out of hand. Pledges to contribute to a safer\r\nworld add up to nothing if mounting demands for\r\nadequately trained and equipped peacekeepers and\r\ncivilian policemen, judges and administrators fall on\r\ndeaf ears. East Timorese, Kosovars and Sierra\r\nLeoneans are pinning their hopes on us. Failure to\r\nrespond to them would mean in the end that we do no\r\nmore than celebrate our own individual security.\r\nLithuania has always been and remains\r\ncommitted to building collective security. On the\r\ninternational level, Lithuania emphasizes active\r\nparticipation in international organizations and its\r\nsubstantial contribution to peacekeeping efforts, such\r\nas its participation in the United Nations standby\r\narrangements system or, from the very beginning of the\r\ninternational engagement in the Balkans, making our\r\ncivilian policemen and military available to the\r\nmissions in Bosnia and Kosovo. Moreover, additional\r\ncommitments will promptly follow as more highly\r\ntrained policemen and troops become available. In this\r\nregard, I wish to voice our strong desire to place a\r\nLithuanian part of the joint Lithuanian-Polish\r\npeacekeeping battalion under the United Nations\r\nstandby arrangements with a view to joining the Stand-\r\nby Forces High-Readiness Brigade.\r\nOn the regional level, we have made membership\r\nin alliances of democratic nations — the European\r\nUnion and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization —\r\nour top priority. We regard the OSCE principles,\r\nincluding a country’s right to choose its own security\r\narrangements, to be of fundamental value to ensuring\r\npeace and security. We believe that, by taking this way,\r\nwe will meet our economic, cultural, social and other\r\nconcerns and enhance European security as a whole.\r\nOn the subregional level, we stress practical\r\ncooperative efforts to uphold democratic and economic\r\ntransformation throughout the region. Over the past\r\ndecade, our engagement with Poland has turned into a\r\nclose partnership that has already produced remarkable\r\nresults. Good bilateral relations with the neighbouring\r\nstates of Latvia and Estonia have grown into a dynamic\r\ntrilateral Baltic cooperation, which has expanded into a\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nbroader Baltic-Nordic cooperation. We also seek to\r\nfurther develop mutually beneficial good-neighbourly\r\nrelations with Russia. Joint Lithuanian-Russian\r\nprojects on cooperation with the Kaliningrad region are\r\na good example of our pursuit of a foreign policy of\r\nfriendly relations, which also fully coincides with the\r\nEuropean Union’s Northern Dimension policies\r\nendorsed at the Feira European Union summit this\r\nJune.\r\nMr. Ben Mustapha (Tunisia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nCooperation requires wisdom and patience. Yet,\r\nall too often, guns have been a choice of cure for ethnic\r\nstrife and social or economic collapse. Vigorous and\r\nurgent efforts are needed to curtail the proliferation of\r\nsmall arms. We deem it vital for the 2001 United\r\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects to address critical\r\nissues in the field of transparency, legitimate transfers,\r\naccountability, enforcement of sanctions and\r\nobservance of moratoriums. A commitment to the\r\nelimination of landmines should now be coupled with\r\nan effort towards putting small arms off limits to\r\nbelligerent causes.\r\nAgainst the background of gains in disarmament,\r\na number of setbacks have made the picture less\r\nencouraging. We share the profound concerns aroused\r\nby the abundance of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nthe proliferation of missiles. I fail to see any way to\r\ncreate a safer world other than reducing, eliminating\r\nand outlawing weapons of mass destruction. In the\r\nwake of the successful outcome of the 2000 Review\r\nConference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\r\nLithuania will work with other committed nations to\r\nachieve unequivocal commitment to nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nCertain fundamental values are essential to\r\ninternational relations. Such are human responsibility\r\nand human rights. At the Millennium Summit,\r\nPresident of Lithuania Valdas Adamkus spoke about\r\nhis belief that\r\n“in the face of a globalized tomorrow, the United\r\nNations will increase the scope of its human-\r\ndimension activities. Human rights should\r\nbecome a cornerstone of the emerging world\r\nstructure”. (A/55/PV.5)\r\nThe concept of the human dimension must be at the\r\ncentre of all United Nations activities.\r\nIf we are to address the root causes of conflict,\r\nwe have to admit that respect for human rights, the\r\nprotection of minority rights and the institution of\r\npolitical arrangements in which all groups are\r\nrepresented are vital. For my region, of particular\r\ninterest is determining how the international\r\ncommunity can promote the rights of people coping\r\nwith the post-communist transition.\r\nThe limits of human rights applicability are being\r\nconstantly questioned. The United Nations should\r\nmove ahead in the search for new and more effective\r\ninstruments to fend off the challengers of human rights.\r\nPersons responsible for genocide, crimes against\r\nhumanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression should\r\nbe brought to justice. If that is the goal which the\r\ninternational community is after, an effective\r\nInternational Criminal Court should start working as\r\nsoon as possible. For its part, Lithuania will make good\r\non its commitment to ratify the Rome Statute by the\r\nend of this year.\r\nBased on the experience of my own country, I\r\nwish to stress that increasing the equality of social,\r\neconomic, educational and political benefits across\r\ngender has a positive impact on economic\r\ndevelopment. These issues have been at the forefront of\r\nthe agendas of all Lithuanian Governments since\r\nregaining independence, which have worked actively to\r\nhelp solve the question of equal rights and other\r\nproblems which women face. One of our achievements\r\nis the adoption of the Law on Equal Opportunities,\r\nwhich is the first law of this kind in Central and\r\nEastern Europe. Being a signatory State to the Second\r\nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination\r\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women, I call\r\nfor its early entry into force.\r\nThe attainment of freedom, security and welfare\r\nfor people is feasible only by embracing the effects of\r\nglobalization and not defying them. We have a global\r\ninstrument readily available for that purpose, yet we\r\nkeep arriving at the same conclusion: we need a United\r\nNations with greater capacity and better performance.\r\nA number of measures have been carried out. The\r\noutstanding efforts of the Secretary-General cannot be\r\noverestimated. Lithuania supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s greater emphasis on the United Nations as a\r\nresults-based Organization. We also endorse the stress\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\non better management, mobilization of new resources\r\nand new forms of partnership. The Security Council\r\nshould play its part in this regard. The lessons drawn\r\nfrom the Secretary-General’s reports on Srebrenica and\r\nRwanda have to be paid more than lip service.\r\nWithin the complex of measured designs for\r\nrevitalizing the United Nations, our efforts to reform\r\nthe Security Council occupy a prominent place. The\r\nSecurity Council would only win if it acquired a new\r\npower and authority base. I would like to reiterate\r\nLithuania’s position that the Security Council should\r\nbe increased, both in permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership categories, and that the Eastern European\r\nGroup should be given one additional non-permanent\r\nmembership seat. In turn, even with a revitalized\r\nCouncil, cooperation with regional organizations\r\nshould be strengthened.\r\nThe reforms, no matter how far-flung, may only\r\nremain a partial success as long as the United Nations\r\nis not given necessary resources. The Organization\r\nneeds a sound and predictable financial footing.\r\nTherefore, Lithuania strongly supports a\r\ncomprehensive review of both the regular-budget scale\r\nand the scale of assessment for peacekeeping\r\noperations. In the latter case, an ad hoc arrangement of\r\n1973 has lost its touch with present day economic\r\nrealities. We need to adjust the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping scale of assessment methodology to\r\nbetter reflect the current economic conditions of all\r\nMember States. I hope that the revision will enjoy\r\nsupport by all countries of the United Nations and will\r\nbe carried out in an expeditious manner.\r\nThe United Nations symbolizes and guards the\r\nhumankind hope for a better future. Let’s make it\r\nhappen!\r\nThe Acting President (Tunisia) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The next speaker will be Mr. Nizar Obaid\r\nMadani, Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia.\r\nMr. Madani (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me pleasure at the outset of the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the General Assembly of the United Nations to\r\nconvey to His Excellency our sincerest congratulation\r\nfor his election to the presidency of this session. His\r\nelection to this important position reflects the respect\r\nof the international community for him personally, as\r\nwell as the appreciation of the Member States for the\r\npositive role played by his country, Finland, in the\r\ninternational arena. I am confident that his presidency\r\nof this session will contribute effectively to our efforts\r\nto achieve the objectives towards which the\r\ninternational community aspires under the present,\r\ndelicate international circumstances.\r\nI also wish to take this opportunity to express our\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nForeign Minister of Namibia and president of the\r\nprevious session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly, who managed the affairs of the session with\r\ngreat competence and experience and who deserves our\r\ncompliments and appreciation.\r\nI am also pleased to express my thanks and\r\nappreciation to His Excellency, the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\ncontinuous and tireless efforts to achieve peace and\r\nenhance security and stability in our contemporary\r\nworld, as well as for the competence and ability he has\r\ndemonstrated in leading the affairs of this\r\nOrganization, relying on his rich and exceptional\r\nexperience in the international arena. In particular, I\r\nwish to commend His Excellency for his sincere and\r\nextensive efforts in organizing the Millennium Summit,\r\nwhich, God willing, will contribute to achieving\r\nfruitful results with positive effect on our peoples and\r\nnations while ushering in a new century full of\r\nchallenges and opportunities.\r\nOn this occasion, I wish to welcome the Republic\r\nof Tuvalu to the membership of the United Nations,\r\nhoping that its membership will enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the Organization and its noble\r\nobjectives.\r\nThe present session of the General Assembly has\r\nfollowed immediately the Millennium Summit, a\r\nunique historical event. World leaders met in a\r\ndignified gathering that exemplified the unity of the\r\nhuman race and their collective endeavour to live in\r\npeace, security and prosperity. That Summit\r\nrepresented a valuable opportunity to reflect on and to\r\ndiscuss whatever might lead to a better life for\r\nhumanity. The world leaders pledged in the final\r\nDeclaration of the Summit to exert all possible efforts\r\nto achieve peace, security and disarmament and\r\neradicate poverty and disease. They affirmed the\r\nsovereign equality of nations, respect for their\r\nterritorial integrity and political independence, and\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. The\r\nSummit also provided a valuable opportunity to\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nevaluate the course of this Organization throughout its\r\nhistory, which has been full of opportunities and\r\nchallenges, so as to enable it to achieve its declared\r\nprinciples and purposes.\r\nIn this regard, a thorough and candid evaluation\r\nof the role of the United Nations was presented by His\r\nRoyal Highness Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz, the\r\nCrown Prince and the head of the Saudi delegation to\r\nthe Millennium Summit. He discussed the challenges\r\nand problems that have impeded the United Nations\r\nfrom achieving the goals and objectives to which the\r\nhuman community aspires.\r\nHis Royal Highness presented a number of ideas\r\nand notions that represent a valuable contribution to\r\nefforts aimed at promoting and vitalizing the role of the\r\nUnited Nations. He mentioned the importance of\r\nlinkage between modernizing the Organization’s\r\nmechanisms and the nature of the issues it confronts.\r\nThe effects of these reforms should consider the\r\nviability and performance of United Nations bodies in\r\na way that enables the United Nations it to fulfil its\r\nrequired role in dealing effectively with the new\r\ndevelopments in modern international relations.\r\nOne of the most apparent features of the new\r\nworld order is the emerging phenomenon of\r\nglobalization, which, as a developed framework for\r\ninternational relations, has occupied a large portion of\r\nthe current political thought of nations. We view\r\nglobalization as a phenomenon that should reflect the\r\nnatural closeness between nations aimed at achieving\r\nsocial justice, overall development, equality among\r\nnations, and broadening the scope of cooperation in a\r\nmanner that serves the issues of peace and security and\r\nstability throughout the world. However, and I read\r\nhere from a statement by His Royal Highness Prince\r\nAbdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz at the Millennium Summit:\r\n“We hope that the United Nations will\r\nsupport us in standing against a globalization that\r\nresults in the hegemony of the strong over the\r\nweak, increases the causes of the oppression and\r\nexploitation of nations, and fosters injustice and\r\ninequality in international relations. We\r\nparticularly warn of the ramifications of\r\nunbridled globalization and its use as an umbrella\r\nto violate the sovereignty of States and interfere\r\nwith their internal affairs under a variety of\r\npretexts especially from the angle of human\r\nrights issues.”\r\nThe United Nations call for a civilized dialogue\r\nand declaring 2001 a year for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations comes at an appropriate time as a\r\ncivilized response to those who propagate the themes\r\nand doctrines of conflict and inevitable clash of\r\ncivilizations. A dialogue among civilizations\r\nrepresents, in fact, a constructive beginning towards\r\nachieving globalization in its positive sense and its\r\nhuman aspect, something to which all peoples and\r\nnations aspire. A dialogue among civilizations would\r\ncontribute to strengthening the values and principles of\r\nunderstanding and cooperation among cultures and\r\ncivilizations. It will further promote respect for other\r\nreligious beliefs and the cultural legacies of other\r\nnations in a way that consolidates the principles of\r\npeaceful coexistence and proliferates the culture of\r\npeace and tolerance.\r\nDeviation from the values and principles of\r\njustice, equality and non-compliance with the rules of\r\ninternational legitimacy in resolving differences and\r\ndisputes through peaceful means has led to the\r\nproliferation of wars and armed conflicts in many parts\r\nof the world. This has caused painful humanitarian\r\nsuffering that continues to arouse the conscience of the\r\nworld community. In our region, Israel continues to\r\ntake intransigent positions and to reject the\r\nrequirements for peace. This became evident during the\r\nrecent talks at Camp David where the Israeli side\r\ninsisted on maintaining positions that are diametrically\r\nopposed to the principles of peace that were agreed to\r\nin Madrid and to what was stated in United Nations\r\nresolutions with respect to the status of Al-Quds Al-\r\nSharif. Both the final communiqué of the Al-Quds\r\nCommittee, which convened recently in Agadir,\r\nMorocco, and the resolution of the Council of the Arab\r\nLeague, adopted at its 114th session, reaffirmed the\r\nunshakeable Arab and Islamic positions with respect to\r\nthe issue of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. It also reaffirmed the\r\nimpossibility of attaining a durable and comprehensive\r\npeace without reaching a just solution to this problem\r\nin a way that preserves Arab and Muslim rights, in\r\naccordance with United Nations resolutions, and that\r\nrespects complete Palestinian sovereignty over Al-\r\nQuds Al-Sharif.\r\nIsrael is making a big mistake if it believes that\r\nthe peace process can proceed without total respect for\r\nthe legitimate rights of the Palestinians to return to\r\ntheir homeland and establish their own independent\r\nState with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Al-Quds\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nAl-Sharif is an integral part of the occupied territories\r\nand is subject to Security Council resolution 242\r\n(1967). Moreover, a comprehensive peace cannot be\r\nachieved without Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\r\nSyrian Golan to the 4 June 1967 line.\r\nWe continue to feel for the suffering of the\r\nfraternal Iraqi people as a result of the continuing\r\nrefusal of their Government to abide fully by United\r\nNations resolutions, which would allow for the lifting\r\nof the sanctions. In reiterating its concern over the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people, the Government of the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia proposed an initiative that\r\nwould allow Iraq to import all the materials and goods\r\nit needed — except those that fall within the context of\r\nmilitary items that threaten Iraq’s neighbours. If such\r\nan initiative had been accepted, the needs of the Iraqi\r\npeople would have been met and their suffering\r\nalleviated. However, the Iraqi Government was swift in\r\nrejecting this gesture, and thus it has prolonged the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people. We once again express the\r\nhope that the Iraqi Government will act quickly to\r\ncomply with Security Council resolution 1284 (1999)\r\nand the mandate of the United Nations Monitoring,\r\nVerification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC)\r\nand of other international committees concerned with\r\nthe release and repatriation of all Kuwaiti and Saudi\r\nprisoners, as well as with the return of Kuwaiti\r\nproperty. We once again reiterate the need to respect\r\nIraq’s independence, unity and territorial integrity.\r\nWe also strongly desire the removal of the causes\r\nof tension in the Gulf region. Accordingly, we hope\r\nthat the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nwill cooperate with the efforts of the tripartite\r\ncommittee, which has been entrusted with creating a\r\nconducive climate for direct negotiations between the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nin order to reach an amicable and acceptable solution\r\nto the issue of the three islands.\r\nAs regards Somalia, my country welcomed the\r\noutcome of the national reconciliation conference,\r\nwhich took place in the town of Arta in Djibouti and\r\nwhich included the election of President Abdikassin\r\nSalad Hassan. We hope that the other Somali factions\r\nwill join the reconciliation efforts aimed at promoting\r\nnational accord and at achieving unity and stability in\r\nSomalia.\r\nIn Afghanistan fierce fighting continues and is\r\ndenying Afghanistan and its people the fruits of\r\nliberation from foreign occupation.\r\nThe Pakistani-Indian conflict over Jammu and\r\nKashmir remains a source of tension between the two\r\nneighbouring countries. We call on both sides to\r\nexercise the utmost restraint and to solve the conflict\r\nthrough negotiations, in accordance with United\r\nNations resolutions, which give the people of Jammu\r\nand Kashmir the right to self-determination.\r\nThe continuation of these disputes and armed\r\nconflicts — which have claimed the lives of millions,\r\ndepleted huge quantities of resources and caused\r\ndestruction and serious damage to the environment —\r\nmakes it incumbent upon the international community\r\nto make every possible effort to put an end to these\r\nconflicts and to find peaceful solutions to them. In this\r\nregard, we look to the United Nations to make greater\r\nefforts to reaffirm its role as a peacemaker and not just\r\na peacekeeper. It has become evident that working to\r\nprevent conflicts from erupting is more effective and\r\nless costly than concentrating on peacekeeping.\r\nIn this respect and in compliance with the\r\nprinciple of resolving conflicts through peaceful\r\nmeans, our region witnessed two important events that\r\nmarked a positive sign in relations between nations. In\r\nJune 2000, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the\r\nRepublic of Yemen signed the Jeddah agreement\r\nestablishing final and permanent, international land and\r\nsea borders. This ended more than 60 years of border\r\ndisputes. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has also\r\nconcluded an agreement with the State of Kuwait for\r\nthe demarcation of the shallow seas adjacent to the\r\nformer neutral zone between the two countries.\r\nThe issue of disarmament is of great concern to\r\nmy country, and we call for greater efforts in this area,\r\nespecially as regards weapons of mass destruction. The\r\npresence of these weapons represents a great danger to\r\ninternational peace and security. We hope that the\r\nnuclear States will fulfil the pledges they made at the\r\n2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and adhere\r\nto the commitment to eradicate their nuclear arsenals.\r\nIn this context, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is\r\nvery concerned about Israel’s refusal to accede to the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty and about its decision to keep\r\nits nuclear programme outside the scope of\r\ninternational controls. Israel’s refusal to adhere to the\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\ninternational will and to become part of this Treaty has\r\naborted all efforts exerted by the peoples and countries\r\nof the Middle East to live in a region free from all\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Israel is the only country\r\nin the region that has yet to accede to the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty, a fact that has disrupted the\r\nbalance of security and threatened peace in the region.\r\nIt is this imperative to stress the need to increase\r\nthe effectiveness of the Non-Proliferation Treaty by\r\nmaking it universal and mandatory.\r\nCooperation on social and political issues has\r\nbecome a necessity that cannot be avoided or\r\nneglected. The economic and social problems of the\r\ndeveloping countries make it incumbent upon us all to\r\npromote policies that can alleviate the effects of these\r\nproblems, which in most cases exacerbate tension\r\nwithin and among nations. We believe that the\r\ndeveloped countries have an obligation to assist in\r\ncombating poverty, food scarcities, drought and\r\nfamine.\r\nIt is unrealistic to apply the concept of\r\nglobalization only as a means to liberalize the\r\nmarkets — removing restrictions — without also\r\ndrafting a framework for action that stresses the need\r\nto consider the economic situation in many of the\r\ndeveloping countries and to assist them in moving to a\r\nstage where they can participate in development. It is\r\ntherefore important for the industrialized and\r\ntechnically advanced countries to help those\r\ndeveloping nations without subjecting them to selective\r\npolicies in technology transfer. Moreover, globalization\r\nshould be a two-way street that requires the developed,\r\nindustrialized nations to liberalize their markets and\r\nopen them up to products from developing nations.\r\nWe are truly objective when dealing with\r\nenvironmental issues. We support conducting serious\r\nand informed studies based on evidence, studies that\r\ntake into consideration the process of development in\r\nthe developing countries. In this regard, we call upon\r\nall States to abide by Agenda 21 and urge the\r\nindustrialized States to honour their international\r\ncommitments regarding the transfer of environmentally\r\nfriendly technology to the developing countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasise that we\r\nare facing enormous challenges in the new era, which\r\nmakes it incumbent upon all of us to strive to achieve\r\nthe maximum possible level of cooperation and\r\nsolidarity. This is not confined to political and military\r\nchallenges, but also includes new waves of challenges\r\nthat result from the contemporary way of life with all\r\nits problems and complications and cannot be solved or\r\nmanaged except through organized collective efforts.\r\nOur firm belief in the important role of the United\r\nNations in dealing with current issues and in\r\nfacilitating appropriate international cooperation to\r\naddress and contain these problems, makes us more\r\ndetermined than ever to support this Organization and\r\nhelp consolidate its constructive role.\r\nIt is my wish that we enter the new millennium\r\nwith stronger determination and commitment to our\r\ncollective goal to establish a secure world where values\r\ntriumph and justice, equality and peace prevail.\r\nAllah says in the Holy Koran:\r\n“Help ye one another in righteousness and piety\r\nbut help ye not one another in sin and rancour.”\r\n(The Holy Koran, V:2)\r\nMay peace and the blessing of Allah be upon you,\r\nSir.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Jozias van Aartsen, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. Van Aartsen (Netherlands): “We, the\r\npeoples” is a powerful rendition of world affairs and a\r\ndaunting portrait of life for future generations. It took\r\nintellect and diplomatic savoir-faire to state a complex\r\ncase in such a concise and forceful way. We are\r\ngrateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for\r\nproducing it.\r\n“We, the peoples” are of course the opening\r\nwords of the Charter, and I want to take them as a point\r\nof departure. Other speakers have done so before me\r\nand have argued in favour of a more robust structure\r\nfor keeping the peace in the world community. They\r\nare right. The United Nations role in the area of\r\npreventing or limiting armed conflict was conceived as\r\nits principal purpose. The Brahimi report has shown\r\nhow, in spite of that, the United Nations peacekeeping\r\nfunction has in fact become its Achilles heel. The\r\nBrahimi recommendations deserve to be\r\nimplemented — the sooner the better. At present, the\r\nNetherlands Government and parliament are debating\r\nhow to improve our national contribution to\r\npeacekeeping.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\n“We, the Peoples” can lead to reflections on a\r\ntotally different side of the United Nations reality as\r\nwell. I, for one, would take this opportunity to argue in\r\nfavour of closer ties between the United Nations and\r\nthe private sector.\r\nIn 1945 the world was run by States. The Charter\r\nhinges on that very assumption. It covers all aspects of\r\nlife as they were prevalent at the time, from peace and\r\nsecurity to social justice, from economic cooperation to\r\nhuman rights. Despite its ambition, the Charter hardly\r\nmentions any other actors besides States. Non-\r\ngovernmental organizations appear in the Charter only\r\nonce. The private sector is not referred to at all. In\r\nother words, the Charter conforms to a model of\r\ngovernance as old as the Peace of Westphalia, a state\r\nsystem going back to the mid-1600s.\r\nIn order to strategize for the future, we need to\r\nask ourselves: who, in actual fact, runs the world\r\ntoday; where and how are world affairs conducted; and\r\nhow can we position the United Nations accordingly?\r\nThe United Nations is made up of Member States.\r\nThat is fitting and proper. States will be the custodians\r\nof foreign relations for a long time to come. But their\r\nroles have changed significantly with time. States can\r\nno longer be thought of as the hard billiard balls of\r\ninternational relations. Internationalization has altered\r\nthe concept of sovereignty. Nor are Sates autonomous\r\nentities as before, pursuing self-defined national\r\ninterests. Their actions are now much more shaped by\r\neconomic pressures, information flows, and population\r\nmovements. For States, too, globalization is here to\r\nstay. Other actors have entered both the domestic and\r\ninternational scenes. Civil society is one. The private\r\nsector is another. Since 1945, civil society, made up of\r\nnon-profit organizations, has blossomed along a wide\r\nspectrum, beyond any expectation of the United\r\nNations founding fathers. Many non-governmental\r\norganizations operate across national boundaries. At\r\nthe present time, the United Nations system could\r\nnever hope to operate properly without the assistance\r\nof non-governmental organizations, not to mention\r\nnormative thinking and advocacy. Non-governmental\r\norganizations have acquired access to the United\r\nNations at different levels, and participate in many of\r\nits discussions.\r\nAlthough a potent actor on the domestic and\r\ninternational levels, the private sector has been\r\nvirtually ignored by traditional United Nations\r\ndiplomacy. The business community, and notably\r\ntransnational corporations, were viewed by many as the\r\ncompetitor, if not as the enemy of international public\r\ninterest. Documents critical of multinationals were\r\nbeing issued by the United Nations and the specialized\r\nagencies until recently. Confrontation rather than\r\ndialogue. I am not contending that there were no\r\ngrounds for that position: quite the contrary. However,\r\nnowadays we see a growing awareness in the business\r\ncommunity of the necessity of responsible corporate\r\npolicies and of a role for private enterprise in the\r\npursuit of interests that go beyond maximizing\r\nimmediate profits. As an example, I refer to the Global\r\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization, in which the\r\npharmaceutical industry closely cooperates with\r\ninternational organizations, Governments and other\r\nactors.\r\nWe need to build on that. Indeed, the time has\r\ncome to expand the concept of a partnership with the\r\nprivate sector. Why? Two reasons. First of all, the\r\nworld is up against incredible odds and, secondly, the\r\nprivate sector does exist and wields a lot of power in\r\nthe international arena.\r\nAbout the odds: take a sustainable future, where\r\nelementary laws of ecology must be respected. Not\r\neven the most powerful Government can put a stop to\r\nglobal warming — nor all the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations combined. A sustainable future needs\r\nto be pursued in conjunction with industry, civil society\r\nand the scientific community. For equitable working\r\nconditions, and other forms of social justice, States\r\nneed to involve the private sector. The same is true for\r\nfighting corruption, the spread of small arms, wasting\r\nwater or AIDS.\r\nWe have truly entered an era that is very different\r\nfrom the one in which the United Nations was born —\r\nan era in which the course of humanity and the quality\r\nof life on earth have more and more become a shared\r\nresponsibility; an era where Governments, the private\r\nsector and civil society are drawn ever more closely\r\ntogether. They all have a stake in global governance.\r\nThe so-called global public goods are a matter for all of\r\nthem together.\r\nThe private sector has a stake in the future of the\r\nplanet, too. Of course, it is here to do business. But no\r\nplanet, no profit. Companies should find it in their own\r\ninterest to assume a responsibility equal to their weight\r\nin international relations and the influence they have at\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nthe domestic level. Chief executive officers, too, want\r\na livable world for their grandchildren. The private\r\nsector must be called upon to enter into a responsible\r\ncorporate partnership in sync with other actors at the\r\ninternational plane. True, the role of each actor needs\r\nto be different. Their motivation can remain different,\r\ntoo — as does the legal basis on which they act. But\r\ntheir determination needs to be the same: the\r\ndetermination to secure the longevity of life as we\r\nknow it and to secure for everyone on the planet an\r\nequitable share of its bounty.\r\nDifferent roles, shared responsibility. That\r\nconcept needs to take root in this Organization as well.\r\nThe United Nations cannot credibly hope to play a\r\ngalvanizing role in meeting the challenges of the\r\ncoming century if it cannot show that its debates and\r\nits action platforms reflect the real world outside the\r\nconference rooms. If we want to see the United Nations\r\nas “unique in world affairs” — as the Millennium\r\nreport puts it — it must be able to show that all players\r\nare on the stage.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s Global Compact could\r\nnot have come at a more opportune moment. It is the\r\nmere beginning of a process, but it is off to a promising\r\nstart. The Global Compact deserves the active support\r\nof the international community, and it deserves to be\r\njoined by other multinationals. I do understand the\r\ntrepidations of some non-governmental organizations\r\nwho fear that multinational corporations will drape\r\nthemselves in the United Nations flag and become\r\nuntouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand, too,\r\nthe apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall, who\r\nhave a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the State\r\nand its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But the\r\nGlobal Compact is not a Trojan horse.\r\nAnd I will go even further. We have given civil\r\nsociety structural access to the United Nations system.\r\nBy contrast, the access we are giving to the private\r\nsector, with the notable exception of the International\r\nLabour Organization, has been ad hoc, not structural.\r\nIn the future, we must create appropriate channels of\r\ncommunication with the private sector, inside this\r\nOrganization, where they, as well as Governments and\r\ncivil society, can try and get a hold on the convulsions\r\nof our time — a forum where, at the very least, they\r\ncan deliberate and begin to break down the barriers of\r\nmistrust that have divided them for so long.\r\nThat is the first reason why the United Nations\r\nneeds to broaden its scope and become more inclusive.\r\nThe second is the power of the private sector. Many\r\ncompanies have turnovers larger than the national\r\nbudgets of some Member States, and the same is true\r\nfor the personal fortunes of some chief executive\r\nofficers. The relationship between States and the\r\nprivate sector has altered dramatically over time. States\r\nwere once thought of as bulwarks against harmful\r\neconomic impact from abroad. Economic weight was\r\nviewed as a trump card in the power play among\r\nnations. Today, States are increasingly serving as\r\ninstruments for adjusting domestic policy to the\r\nrealities of the present-day world economy. They have\r\nbecome intermediaries between the world economy,\r\nwith its own structure of power, and domestic societies.\r\nThis brings up the question of where world affairs\r\nare being conducted and how they have caused a shift\r\nin the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization has\r\nshifted the focus of attention to forums other than the\r\nUnited Nations here in New York, notably to the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the\r\nWorld Trade Organization and, on a regional level, the\r\nEuropean Union. Policies are tested in the margins of\r\nthe World Economic Forum in Davos or decided\r\nelsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs.\r\nThat focus has brought on a different cast of players\r\nthan in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. Foreign\r\nMinisters now work shoulder to shoulder not only with\r\ndevelopment ministers, but also with finance and trade\r\nministers, as well as with central bankers. International\r\naffairs, whether we like it or not, are increasingly about\r\neconomics.\r\nForging a relationship with the private sector is\r\ntherefore indispensable if the United Nations wants to\r\npreserve its relevance over the long haul. The\r\nmultilateral system, for its part, must seek closer ties\r\nwith other centres of power and with the business\r\ncommunity. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorously\r\npursuing closer relations with all these various forums,\r\nand we encourage him to do more of the same.\r\nResponsible corporate partnership is also about\r\nprotecting the weak. The United Nations was set up not\r\nonly to guarantee peace and security, but also to secure\r\nfreedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages,\r\nglobalization is leaving too many victims by the\r\nwayside. The gap between the rich and the poor\r\ncontinues to widen, and the poor suffer the most, in\r\nwar and in peace. Meanwhile, the private sector wields\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\na great deal of power in its decisions as to where it will\r\nbuy, sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directly\r\non the quality of life in many developing countries.\r\nEven though the odds are staggering, the United\r\nNations system can make a difference in reducing\r\npoverty, gender inequality and child and maternal\r\nmortality. But it can make a difference only from a\r\nposition of strength and from a platform shared by\r\nother actors at the international level: from a position\r\nof shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit has\r\ndeclared poverty eradication the United Nations\r\nnumber one priority. We applaud that. But fighting\r\npoverty is not only a moral imperative, as it always has\r\nbeen; it has also become an economic one. That is\r\nanother reason for the United Nations to become more\r\ninclusive of the private sector.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report (A/54/2000), “We\r\nthe peoples”, duly poses the question of how to take\r\nthe United Nations forward. Whatever the way\r\nforward, it needs to be a bold one. For too long we\r\nhave been remoulding old ideas. While doing so, we\r\nhave kept the United Nations on a very short leash,\r\nhardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More of\r\nthe same is not enough. In other words, the United\r\nNations is bound to miss its cue if we, the peoples,\r\npursue our business as usual. The future will pass us\r\nby.\r\nThe alternative is an avenue that is much more\r\nambitious. It amounts to using the United Nations\r\nsystem as a vehicle for the development of a new\r\nvision of world politics, a vision for the “post-\r\nWestphalian” era. In such a vision, present trends\r\nwould be given legitimacy and a conceptual\r\nframework. In such a vision, the principle of non-\r\nintervention yields to the defence of human rights;\r\nsovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for\r\ncivil society and the private sector; and economics are\r\nalso held responsible for social and development goals.\r\nSuch is the road less travelled, but the only one that\r\ncan make all the difference.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Abdelaziz Belkhadem,\r\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAlgeria.\r\nMr. Belkhadem (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like first of all, on my own behalf and that of\r\nthe Algerian delegation, to convey to Mr. Holkeri\r\nheartfelt congratulations on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession. I wish him every success in discharging his\r\nnoble duties. The choice of Mr. Holkeri as President is\r\na tribute to his personal qualities and to the experience\r\nof his country, Finland, with which we enjoy a firm\r\nfriendship.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\r\nconvey to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the\r\nForeign Minister of Namibia, our deep appreciation\r\nand gratitude for the great effort he made during his\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession.\r\nFinally, I should like to salute the spirit of\r\ninitiative and commitment shown by our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, the head of the Secretariat,\r\nand commend his sincere and tireless work to reform\r\nthe Organization and to give it a new dynamism so as\r\nto prepare it to meet the challenge of the enormous\r\nchanges in international relations.\r\nI should also like to welcome the State of Tuvalu\r\nas a new Member of our Organization.\r\nJust a few days ago, the United Nations hosted a\r\npolitical event that was without precedent since the\r\nOrganization was created: the Millennium Summit.\r\nBecause of a host of fast-paced developments that\r\noccurred in international relations, we, the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations, must take time at this juncture of\r\nhistory to organize a dialogue to discuss the shape of\r\nthe new emerging world order and the effects on us, the\r\npeoples, the States and the United Nations, the\r\nrepository of our collective hopes and aspirations.\r\nThe world has changed in a very short time from\r\na system with clearly defined parameters to a system\r\nwhere political and economic reference points are\r\nsorely lacking. It is a system defined by nebulous\r\nphenomena, which evolve according to rules set by\r\nforces that refuse, in the name of globalization, to\r\naccept any form of guidance or collective democratic\r\noversight. It is no surprise that globalization is\r\nincreasing the suspicions and fears of the developing\r\ncountries vis-à-vis the evolving new world order. The\r\ncurrent state of international relations, marked by\r\ninjustice and imbalance, will inevitably get worse\r\nbecause of the unbridled process of globalization.\r\nIt is because of this that the Millennium Summit\r\nforcefully proclaimed the need to reinvigorate the\r\nUnited Nations and to galvanize its role, since it is the\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nrefuge of the weak and the marginalized. The massive\r\npresence of the leaders of the whole world at the\r\nSummit was irrefutable proof of the commitment of the\r\npeoples and nations of the world to the United Nations\r\nand to the principles and purposes it embodies. The\r\nUnited Nations is the only forum built on the ideals and\r\nreference points shared by mankind as a whole, marked\r\nby universality and globality in its missions and\r\nprerogatives.\r\nCertainly the United Nations is facing today new\r\nchallenges caused by rapid, profound and sometimes\r\nsurprising changes in international affairs. No one\r\ndenies the fact that it needs to be radically reformed in\r\norder to prepare it and adapt it effectively to meet\r\ncurrent and future challenges and to manage and\r\nredress the contradictions of international relations.\r\nSecurity Council reform and expansion of its\r\nmembership are urgent matters, because this important\r\nbody clearly lacks the necessary representativity to\r\ngive legitimacy and efficiency to its decisions and\r\nactions.\r\nLikewise, consolidation of democracy and\r\ninternational relations, if it is to be truly meaningful,\r\nmust involve the enhancement of the General\r\nAssembly and the establishment of its role as the\r\nprincipal source of international law, as well as\r\noversight over the three principal organs, in keeping\r\nwith the United Nations Charter. Accordingly,\r\nmarginalization of the Assembly, when it comes to\r\nmajor questions such as the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, does not in any way\r\nallow the overwhelming majority of nations to\r\ncontribute to the decision-making process in\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nOpening the United Nations to the outside world\r\nis a necessity dictated by changes in the international\r\ncommunity and the demands of our times. By involving\r\ncivil society in its work, the United Nations will\r\nbenefit from the considerable contribution that non-\r\ngovernmental partners can provide in meeting the\r\nneeds of countries in matters of development,\r\nparticularly in the areas of education, health and\r\nhousing. But this partnership cannot be at the expense\r\nof the purposes and principles of the United Nations,\r\nnor the independence of its decisions.\r\nIt is in the context of this vision that we state our\r\nposition on humanitarian intervention. For us it is a\r\nquestion not of whether or not it is acceptable to\r\nintervene in humanitarian disasters, but, rather, of legal\r\nand political parameters that should govern any\r\ndecision on this matter. We therefore demand that\r\nterms of reference be clearly and precisely established,\r\nthat they should be democratically adopted in a context\r\nof transparency and that they should effectively reflect\r\nthe will of the community of nations. They must be\r\nbased on principles of solidarity and justice, ruling out\r\nany forms of selectivity, special treatment or double\r\nstandards.\r\nExperience has shown that the international\r\ncommunity has found in the United Nations a\r\nframework that allows for considerable progress to be\r\nmade with regard to security and cooperation. In the\r\narea of disarmament, for example, thanks to the\r\navailable frameworks for negotiation and dialogue, the\r\nOrganization has been able to realize considerable\r\nachievements, such as the signing of many conventions\r\non weapons of mass destruction and the success of the\r\n2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\r\npresided over by Algeria.\r\nThe United Nations has also provided a\r\nframework to coordinate international efforts to deal\r\nwith new dangers that pose a threat to international\r\npeace and security, such as terrorism, organized crime,\r\nand drug and arms trafficking. On the subject of\r\nterrorism, the international community has embarked\r\non a process of implementing its strategy to combat\r\nthis scourge and to prevent it. The United Nations and\r\nregional groups have adopted legal instruments that\r\nsupplement international laws dealing with anti-\r\nterrorist actions. We hope that these achievements will\r\nbe enhanced by the adoption of a comprehensive\r\ninternational convention, to be considered a political,\r\nlegal and moral international covenant, to combat\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nAlgeria is keen that its relations within its\r\npolitical and geographical spheres be governed by a\r\nvision of the future that goes beyond short-term\r\ninteractions or ephemeral motives. In our policy\r\ntowards the peoples and countries with which we have\r\nrelations of neighbourliness, geography and common\r\nheritage, we want to consolidate the principle of\r\ndialogue and consultation and develop cooperation and\r\nsolidarity in keeping with the demands of good\r\nneighbourliness, common destiny, mutual interest,\r\nmutual trust and non-interference in the internal affairs\r\nof States.\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nRegarding the Arab Maghreb region, Algeria’s\r\ncommitment to build a unified, stable and prosperous\r\nMaghreb is based on our conviction that Maghreb unity\r\nis a strategic option dictated by the aspirations of the\r\npeoples of the region and by the current international\r\nsituation, which encourages integration and the\r\nformation of blocs. Algeria is prepared today to work\r\nwith its Maghreb partners to reactivate the process on\r\nthe basis of an objective thorough analysis of common\r\nMaghreb action according to a rigorous and pragmatic\r\nmethodology that seeks to maximize the\r\ncomplementarities of the countries of the region and\r\nthat ensures gradual integration, taking into account the\r\nprinciples of equity and balance of interests.\r\nIt is on the basis of this vision that Algeria has\r\nspared no effort to help find a just and lasting solution\r\nto the problem of Western Sahara. Algeria’s support for\r\nthe United Nations settlement plan is based on our\r\ncommitment to preserve the security and stability of\r\nthe region, without, however, rejecting the principle of\r\nthe right of peoples to self-determination. The\r\nsettlement plan, which was supported by both sides —\r\nMorocco and the POLISARIO Front — and by the\r\ninternational community, remains the practical,\r\nrealistic option that will guarantee a just and lasting\r\nsolution to this issue. Today the settlement plan is at a\r\ndelicate stage, and the international community, which\r\nhas already made a considerable effort to implement it,\r\nmust give it even more attention and more support.\r\nThanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General and his\r\nPersonal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, and the cooperation\r\nof both sides, the United Nations Mission for the\r\nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has\r\nresolved the difficulties that for so long prevented\r\nimplementation of the plan. Today, there is no reason to\r\ndelay or to block the referendum process.\r\nMy country is convinced of the interdependence\r\nof the interests of the States and peoples on both shores\r\nof the Mediterranean Sea. We therefore reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to the Euro-Mediterranean process, which\r\nprovides a promising framework for the promotion of\r\ndialogue and consultation among the countries of the\r\nregion and opens up great prospects for understanding,\r\nintercultural exchange and improvement of partnership\r\nfor the benefit of all peoples.\r\nThe Middle East region has seen some\r\ndevelopments this year that have had an important\r\nimpact on the peace process. The question of Palestine,\r\nwhich is at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict, is at a\r\ndelicate stage. That means that the international\r\ncommunity must mobilize even further in order to\r\nmove the peace talks forward. Algeria reiterates its\r\nsupport for the Palestinian people and salutes their\r\nstruggle for recovering their legitimate rights,\r\nincluding the right to establish their own independent\r\nState with Al-Quds as its capital.\r\nAlgeria would also like to reaffirm its support for\r\nthe fraternal Syrian people and its right to recover the\r\noccupied Golan.\r\nWe express our profound satisfaction and pride at\r\nLebanon’s regaining its sovereignty over all its\r\nterritory.\r\nAlgeria once again reaffirms the need to lift the\r\nembargo that has hit the fraternal Iraqi people so hard.\r\nWe also call for a final lifting of the sanctions\r\nthat continue to penalize the fraternal peoples of Libya\r\nand the Sudan.\r\nAfrica is undergoing profound changes that are\r\nopening up new vistas for the peoples and countries of\r\nthat continent. Those changes have been brought about\r\nby the serious and determined will of Africans to free\r\nthemselves from the burdens of the past and by their\r\naspiration to join in the process of change that is\r\nsweeping our world today. Democracy is gaining\r\nground daily as the mode of governance for the vast\r\nmajority of societies in Africa. The State of law and\r\nrespect for human rights are becoming embedded in\r\nAfrican societies. That tendency is strikingly reflected\r\nin the historic decision by the 1999 Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment no longer to recognize any anti-\r\nconstitutional changes. That was a promising sign for\r\nthe establishment of a democratic culture in Africa.\r\nAt the economic level, African countries have\r\nwasted no time in joining the world trend towards a\r\nmarket economy and in creating the necessary\r\nconditions to promote free trade and investment.\r\nWith regard to the conflicts that have devastated\r\nthe continent and continue to cause humanitarian\r\ndisasters and to tarnish Africa’s prestige, the\r\ncontinent’s leaders are now using preventive diplomacy\r\nand their own skills in mediating and settling conflict.\r\nAlong the same lines, the OAU’s Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution is\r\nbeing reinforced as the authority of reference to\r\nprovide a framework for dialogue and conflict\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nprevention. As a result of those efforts, we see signs of\r\neasing in various conflicts in some parts of Africa.\r\nThrough its chairmanship of the OAU last year, my\r\ncountry made great efforts to resolve some of those\r\nconflicts and to limit their scale.\r\nAlgeria’s efforts were successful in the case of\r\nthe conflict between two neighbours, Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, where the Algiers Agreement on Cessation of\r\nHostilities doused the fire of that destructive war\r\nbetween two fraternal peoples. The Agreement now\r\noffers real prospects for a just and lasting settlement of\r\nthe border dispute between the two countries.\r\nAlgeria has also stepped up its initiatives to end\r\nthe conflict in the sisterly nation of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. In coordination and\r\nconsultation with the countries of the region concerned\r\nand with the United Nations, President Abdelaziz\r\nBouteflika has intensified his efforts with the parties,\r\nurging them to find a peaceful and negotiated solution\r\nin order to spare the peoples of that country any further\r\nsuffering and preserve its unity and territorial integrity.\r\nToday, more than a year since the Lusaka Agreement,\r\nwe can only view with regret the reversals that have\r\ntaken place in the peace process in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. Those setbacks have led to a\r\ndeferment by the United Nations of the deployment of\r\nits peacekeeping mission.\r\nUNITA’s continued defiance of the international\r\ncommunity in Angola and its failure to comply with the\r\ncommitments it made in the peace process continue to\r\ninflict the disastrous consequences of an endless war\r\non the people of Angola. While reaffirming UNITA’s\r\nresponsibility for the ongoing war in that country, we\r\nnote with satisfaction the new effectiveness of\r\nsanctions on that rebel group. We reiterate the need for\r\ncomplete compliance by any means necessary to make\r\nthe rebel elements comply with international law and\r\nhonour their commitments under the Lusaka\r\nAgreement.\r\nThe solidarity expressed by the international\r\ncommunity for the efforts of the leaders of Sierra\r\nLeone to restore peace and security must be\r\naccompanied by a tough attitude towards the criminal\r\nelements guilty of murder and despicable acts against\r\ncivilians. Those acts have not spared even members of\r\nthe United Nations Mission.\r\nWhile we reaffirm the fundamental role of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, we\r\ncontinue to stress the need for the Security Council to\r\ndemonstrate the same effectiveness and speed of action\r\nwith regard to conflicts in Africa as it does in\r\nconnection with conflicts in other regions of the world.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to express our desire that\r\nthe General Assembly give the necessary attention and\r\nin-depth consideration to the Brahimi report’s\r\nrecommendations on peacekeeping operations, and that\r\nit implement those recommendations so as to make the\r\nUnited Nations more effective in this essential area of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe contrasts that exist in today’s world can be\r\nseen very clearly in the economic and social situation\r\nof the world. Humanity has never before achieved such\r\na level of technological development. That\r\ndevelopment now makes it possible to meet basic\r\nhuman needs economically, socially and culturally.\r\nHowever, some segments of humanity continue to\r\nsuffer the most abject forms of poverty and destitution.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report to the Millennium\r\nSummit contains a clear formulation of those\r\ncontradictions, which do us no credit as a civilized\r\nsociety that aspires to preserve human dignity and to\r\nprotect the rights of those whose rights have been\r\nwrested from them.\r\nMr. Kofi Annan also recognized in his report that\r\nthe benefits of globalization remain limited to a small\r\ngroup of people. That fact reinforces our conviction of\r\nthe need to accelerate the restructuring of international\r\nrelations and our insistence on the need for a serious\r\nand comprehensive dialogue between the North and the\r\nSouth to find solutions for the imbalances that exist in\r\nthe international financial and trade systems.\r\nIt is time to tackle international economic\r\nrelations from the standpoint of humankind’s needs and\r\ndignity rather than from the standpoint of market forces\r\nalone, because experience has proved that such forces\r\ndo not accord the necessary importance to social\r\nissues. If there is one area in which we must translate\r\ninto reality the values of solidarity upon which the\r\nUnited Nations was founded and the interdependence\r\nwhich marks international relations, it is that of\r\ncombating poverty, ignorance and epidemics.\r\nEffective and unified tackling of the problem of\r\nsustainable development in the third world necessarily\r\nentails settling the problem of debt, reviving\r\ncooperation for development, promoting investments\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nand opening up the markets of the North to the\r\nproducts and commodities of the South.\r\nWe are meeting today for the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in our century, which has been\r\nmarked by many events, a century in which the horror\r\nof destructive wars was mingled with the joy of peace\r\nand détente, a century marked by a struggle between\r\nhope and resignation, where it became evident that\r\npeople are at once capable of the most abject acts and\r\nthe most useful kinds of actions.\r\nWe leave behind a century and usher in another,\r\nhopeful that humankind will learn from the past and\r\nwill demonstrate the necessary determination to avoid\r\nmaking the same mistakes, for which we have paid\r\nsuch a high price.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Roberto Rojas López,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Worship of Costa\r\nRica.\r\nMr. Rojas López (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me at the outset to congratulate\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri on his well-deserved election to\r\npreside over the work of the General Assembly, which\r\nattests both to his outstanding personal qualities and to\r\nthe admiration that the international community has for\r\nhis country, Finland. Allow me also to express our\r\ngratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for\r\nhis excellent work.\r\nJust a week ago, in this same Hall, our heads of\r\nState or Government held the Millennium Summit.\r\nThat historic event served as the framework for an in-\r\ndepth consideration of the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe next century and for the reiteration, at the highest\r\npolitical level, of the universal support for this\r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is now up to us to elaborate on our leaders’\r\nobservations and determine what is necessary to build a\r\nmore prosperous future, a more just society and an\r\nincreasingly human civilization.\r\nAt the outset of the new millennium, scientific\r\nand technological achievements in all fields are\r\nallowing us to glimpse an ever-brighter future.\r\nHowever, a double threat exists to progress towards\r\nthat goal. On one hand, it is endangered by uneven\r\ngrowth, which threatens to deepen the divide between\r\nthe wealthiest and the poorest. More effective measures\r\nmust be adopted to create a more just and equitable\r\nsociety and international community.\r\nOn the other hand, the future is also threatened by\r\nthe temptation of absolute materialism, which can be\r\nunderstood as the danger of reducing development to\r\nthe mere satisfaction of material needs. The risk of\r\ntransforming the human being into a commodity and\r\nthe temptation to seek wealth instead of happiness\r\nrepresent a continuing threat. We must establish a new\r\nsociety whose goal should be the promotion of the\r\nwell-being of all, as reflected in their full physical,\r\nintellectual and spiritual development. We must create\r\na society centred on ideas, creativity and abilities, and\r\nnot on power or wealth.\r\nThe United Nations can and should play a central\r\nrole in the construction of this new society. However,\r\nwe must note, honestly and courageously, that so far\r\nthe United Nations and the international community as\r\na whole have been held back by innumerable\r\nconstraints and restrictions and known many failures.\r\nMore than 50 years ago, at the founding of this\r\nOrganization, we committed ourselves to eradicating\r\nthe scourge of war, and we undertook to promote social\r\nprogress and better living conditions for all.\r\nUnfortunately, though, to date, the United Nations\r\nhas been unable to respond fully to these pleas. We\r\nreact to political and military crises with hollow\r\nstatements to the press. We condemn gross violations\r\nof human rights with procedural resolutions, which are\r\nthen forgotten on our shelves. We create organs,\r\ncommittees and tribunals without any real capacity for\r\naction and lacking the necessary resources to fulfil\r\ntheir mandates. We convene summits, conferences and\r\nmeetings that limit themselves to repeating empty\r\ndeclarations and passing commitments. We send\r\nmilitary observers who are unable to maintain peace\r\nbecause we do not provide them with the necessary\r\nresources or political support. Over and over again we\r\nadopt inadequate measures to resolve crises, hoping\r\nthat they will perform miracles. We send international\r\nexperts with development programmes that respond\r\nneither to the needs nor the desires of their recipients.\r\nThis Organization has imposed sanctions that affect\r\ninnocent civilians while at the same time inadvertently\r\nstrengthening criminal regimes.\r\nWe recognize, of course, that many of the United\r\nNations activities have been successful and\r\npraiseworthy. We cannot overlook the work of the\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees or of the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) in favour of victims of war and of children,\r\nnor can we forget the heroic sacrifice of many Blue\r\nHelmets and humanitarian personnel. We must always\r\nkeep in mind the valuable mediation efforts and good\r\noffices provided to defuse armed conflicts. We must\r\nlearn from those peacekeeping operations that have\r\nbeen crowned with success in spite of all of the\r\ndifficulties. We must recall and respect the gradual\r\ncodification of human rights and of the need to provide\r\nthe highest possible standards of living.\r\nBut the world expects greater leadership from the\r\nUnited Nations. The world’s peoples are calling for\r\nfirm and decisive action on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. Humanity is looking to us to fulfil the lofty\r\ngoals that we set for ourselves when we founded this\r\nOrganization.\r\nFor these reasons, new bases must be established\r\nfor the actions of the United Nations. The Organization\r\nmust be provided with a renewed political and\r\nphilosophical paradigm that will enable it to garner the\r\npolitical and material support it needs from all States in\r\norder effectively to achieve its goals.\r\nToday the United Nations requires all of our\r\nsupport. Each one of us is obliged, individually and\r\ncollectively, to provide the best living conditions\r\npossible to all our fellow citizens.\r\nThe primary objective of the United Nations in\r\nthe twenty-first century must be to promote full respect\r\nfor human rights. More than 50 years after the adoption\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the\r\ncontinuing violation of those rights, through\r\ninexcusable killings for political, religious or ethnic\r\nmotives and through the displacement of millions of\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, is a matter\r\nfor profound concern. We are distressed also by the\r\nfact that thousands perish daily of starvation or easily\r\ncurable diseases. We are concerned at the fact that\r\nthousands of persons are still persecuted or\r\nincarcerated because of their political opinions and that\r\nfor those reasons hundreds are subject to the most\r\ndegrading torture or are forced to live in extreme\r\npoverty.\r\nThe persistence of war is the cause of inexcusable\r\natrocities and recurrent humanitarian crisis. The true\r\nvictims of war are not the fallen soldiers but the\r\ndisplaced or refugee children and elderly, the women\r\nwho are raped, the young people who are murdered, the\r\nmothers who lose their incomes, the innocent workers\r\nwhose workplaces are destroyed, the students whose\r\nschools are bombed, the sick who cannot go to hospital\r\nbecause there are no bridges and no medicines. In the\r\ncontemporary world, every armed conflict, every civil\r\nwar, every massive violation of human rights, every\r\nhumanitarian emergency, caused either by man or by\r\nnature, calls for coordinated international action\r\nthrough this Organization.\r\nIn that context, all States must politically and\r\nfinancially support United Nations activities to\r\neradicate the scourge of war. The Organization must\r\nregain leadership in maintaining international peace\r\nand security. It is imperative that all States strictly\r\nadhere to the prohibition of the use of force.\r\nFor those reasons, one of our tasks is to revitalize\r\nthe Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy\r\nand its capacity for action. That organ should never\r\ntransfer, abandon or renounce its primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nTo the contrary, it is essential to ensure that it can\r\nperform its functions satisfactorily by providing it with\r\nthe necessary resources and political support.\r\nThe Security Council cannot renounce its role\r\nsimply because it is unable to find a quick or\r\ninexpensive solution to a crisis. We cannot accept the\r\nestablishment of peacekeeping operations that lack\r\npersonnel and resources to the point of being\r\nirrelevant. Nor can we accept the dispatch of personnel\r\nwho lack training or motivation and who become easy\r\nvictims of conflicts. By no means can we consent to the\r\nimposition of sanctions regimes that affect innocent\r\npopulations. When establishing a peacekeeping\r\nmission, the Security Council must define realistic\r\ngoals, so that mandates and resources will be\r\ncommensurate with the actual requirements of the\r\ncrisis it is to face.\r\nArmed conflicts and political crises are\r\nmultifaceted phenomena. Every emergency situation\r\npresents a series of political, military and economic\r\nproblems. True peace can be attained only when all\r\nindividuals enjoy proper living conditions, when they\r\npossess a sufficiently high level of economic\r\ndevelopment to meet their basic needs, when their\r\nfundamental human rights are respected and when their\r\ninterests and individual rights are guaranteed by\r\ndemocratic means.\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nTrue peace requires a culture and a climate that\r\nfoster mutual respect and that categorically reject\r\nviolence. In order to achieve peace, we must create a\r\nculture of peace. With a view to creating such a culture\r\nof peace, the United Nations must promote not only\r\npeace but also social justice, democracy and\r\ndevelopment. This should actively involve the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the United\r\nNations Development Programme. We advocate in\r\nparticular the strengthening of the role of the Economic\r\nand Social Council so that it can effectively monitor\r\nand coordinate the implementation of the economic,\r\nsocial, cultural and environmental activities of the\r\nUnited Nations and of all its organs.\r\nIn this regard, international cooperation plays a\r\ncentral role in supporting local initiatives for\r\ndevelopment, democratization and the promotion of\r\nhuman rights. Unfortunately, we are witnessing a\r\ndecrease in international assistance in these fields\r\nwhile the demand continues to grow. To address this\r\nsituation, each nation has to take into its own hands the\r\ntask of creating the conditions necessary to attain\r\npeace, development and justice.\r\nWe believe that only if human rights are fully\r\nrespected will it be possible to create and sustain the\r\nconditions necessary for the full development of all\r\nmen and women. The promotion of democracy and\r\nsocial and economic development are also\r\nindispensable instruments to generate the material,\r\nsocial and spiritual conditions required for this\r\ncomprehensive development.\r\nOur experience has taught us that only democracy\r\ncan provide the necessary framework for the full\r\nrespect of human rights. Only democracy which grants\r\nall citizens equal rights and opportunities to participate\r\nin the political process can secure true peace. Only a\r\ndemocratic system which bestows on all people equal\r\nopportunities to enjoy the benefits of economic\r\ndevelopment and personal accomplishment will make\r\npossible sustainable and just development. For that\r\nreason, we celebrate the democratic consolidation that,\r\nthanks to recent elections after a long period under the\r\nsame ruling party, is being enjoyed by Mexico and by\r\nthe Republic of China in Taiwan — which deserves an\r\nappropriate place in international forums.\r\nAdditionally, our own national evolution has\r\ntaught us that the first step in such a policy is the\r\nelimination or reduction of military budgets. Costa\r\nRica abolished its army more than 50 years ago and has\r\nsince been free from armed conflict with its neighbours\r\nand from military oppression of its population.\r\nReduction of military expenditure is especially\r\nvaluable for developing States whose resources are\r\nlimited and cannot be mismanaged. In that context,\r\narmies are a heavy burden on national budgets and a\r\nconstant source of tension and repression. Would it not\r\nbe better to devote to health the $191 billion that\r\ndeveloping countries waste on their armed forces?\r\nWould it not be preferable to allocate to education the\r\n$22 billion dollars that are spent in arms transfers to\r\nthe third world? Our historical experience has made us\r\na witness to and an example of the multifaceted and\r\npositive relationship between disarmament and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe second step on the path to peace and\r\ndevelopment is to devote as many resources as possible\r\nto education and health. Only an educated people can\r\nlive in freedom; only a healthy people can work for\r\ndevelopment; only a cultured people can be a part of\r\nthe contemporary globalized world. For those reasons,\r\nwe must invest intensively and systematically in our\r\nhuman resources while also striving for economic\r\ndevelopment, social justice and the institutionalization\r\nof democracy.\r\nThe third step towards the future is to secure\r\nrespect for human rights and democracy to enable\r\npeoples to choose freely their own destinies and to\r\nfacilitate the coordination of all of society’s actors. In\r\nmy country, we have deeply committed ourselves to\r\nthose principles, both in the national sphere through\r\nconstitutional provisions, and in the international arena\r\nthrough various international conventions and treaties.\r\nIn this regard, the issue of migrations is of the\r\ngreatest importance to my country. Costa Rica has\r\ngiven emphasis to the need to relocate the nationals of\r\neach country peacefully and in an orderly fashion to\r\nsatisfy their specific immigration and emigration\r\nneeds; to the movements of qualified human resources\r\nto promote economic, social and cultural progress in\r\nthe receiving countries; and to the orderly reintegration\r\nand resettlement of persons who, for one reason or\r\nanother, have been obliged to abandon their country or\r\nplace of origin or who have been forced to leave a\r\nnation that did not allow them to exercise their right\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nnot to emigrate. Therefore, we appreciate the key role\r\nplayed by the International Organization for Migration\r\n(IOM), and we advocate in particular that States that\r\nhave not yet done so make the necessary amendments\r\nto their domestic legislation in order to guarantee this\r\nright to all human beings.\r\nThere are three main elements in the process of\r\ndevelopment that we believe require greater attention.\r\nFirst, we should reconstruct society and its values,\r\nespecially through a renewed effort to acknowledge\r\nand protect the value of the family in its role as\r\nsociety’s basic cell. Unfortunately, the family is the\r\nfirst victim of political and economic crisis, thus\r\nforcing its dissolution by the scattering of its members.\r\nFor this reason, we must emphasize that families are\r\nthe schools where the basic values of coexistence and\r\nrespect for the dignity of all other persons are taught,\r\nand that, without them, it is impossible to create a\r\nstable society.\r\nSecondly, it is necessary to make greater efforts\r\nto pursue sustainable development in all areas of\r\nhuman endeavour. In this sense, we are pleased to\r\nreport that Costa Rica has achieved significant\r\nadvances in the environmental field regarding the\r\npreservation of its rich biodiversity and the promotion\r\nof development in harmony with nature. We are one of\r\nthe first nations to have undertaken carbon fixation and\r\nthe sale of oxygen as an additional source of income\r\nfor development, on the basis of the sustainable use of\r\nour forests and recognition of the economic value of\r\nthe environmental services that they provide to all\r\nhumanity. In the same vein, we have incorporated the\r\nprovisions of the Kyoto Protocol into our domestic\r\nlegal system. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to\r\ngo towards fully sustainable development.\r\nSimilarly, Costa Rica is honoured to be the\r\nheadquarters of the Earth Council and the University\r\nfor Peace, which are working jointly to promote a\r\nconcept of development in greater harmony with the\r\nenvironment. We are confident that the University for\r\nPeace, in particular, can play a constructive role both in\r\nthe promotion of sustainable development as in the\r\ncreation of a culture of peace. Thanks to the work of its\r\nnew Council and in particular Mr. Maurice Strong, who\r\npresides over it, that institution can count on my\r\nGovernment’s unwavering support.\r\nWe take this opportunity to reiterate our pledge to\r\noffer our country as the headquarters of the Secretariat\r\nof the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests. We are\r\nconfident that this new organ will finally secure the\r\ninternational community’s coordinated and\r\ncomprehensive action with respect to forests.\r\nThirdly, it is necessary to ensure that economic\r\ndevelopment is sustainable. To achieve this goal, it is\r\nnecessary to modify the international economic order,\r\nwith a view to making it more just and balanced, so\r\nthat it can grant to the smaller developing countries\r\ngreater access to the benefits of the globalization\r\nprocess and the opportunities for development that it\r\ncreates. Open commercial mechanisms enabling\r\ncommerce and investment to be engines for economic\r\ngrowth should be established. In a parallel, we should\r\ntarget our developmental policies towards more\r\nefficient use of the digital revolution, which provides\r\nus with many opportunities to compete in the global\r\nmarket and to increase our production. In short, we\r\nmust democratize globalization.\r\nWe believe that knowledge and opportunities to\r\naccess information and the new technologies are\r\nessential today to generate well-being. In today’s\r\nworld, marked by new technological frontiers, our\r\nendeavours should also be directed towards narrowing\r\nthe digital divide. We should seek to provide more just\r\nand equitable access to the opportunities open to us in\r\norder to transform economic and social activities. In\r\naccordance with this thesis, Costa Rica recently\r\ninitiated the programme “Communications without\r\nfrontiers”, becoming the first nation to provide free e-\r\nmail to all its population.\r\nDemocracy, sustainable development and human\r\nrights constitute the three fundamental elements upon\r\nwhich the United Nations action must be based, as well\r\nas that of each of our nations. None is an end in itself;\r\nrather they are only a means to secure better living\r\nconditions for all people. The true goal of our action\r\ncentres on the human being; it is to guarantee greater\r\nhappiness for all persons, the greatest respect for their\r\ndignity and the necessary conditions for their full\r\nphysical, intellectual and spiritual development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I call\r\nnext on His Excellency, Mr. Petre Roman, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nRomania.\r\nMr. Roman (Romania) (spoke in Spanish): I am\r\ndelighted to extend to Mr. Harri Holkeri, the new\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession, my sincere congratulations on his election.\r\nI warmly welcome Tuvalu, the latest newcomer to\r\nthe United Nations family.\r\nI cannot continue without expressing my sincere\r\nappreciation to our dedicated Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, under whose leadership the winds of\r\nchange keep on blowing.\r\nI hail the results of the Millennium Summit. The\r\nviews expressed by leaders from all over the world\r\nhave shown how crucial it is, at this point in history, to\r\nreshape our Organization so as to respond adequately\r\nto the great challenges of our times.\r\nFrom this rostrum, and in other forums, political\r\nleaders have endeavoured to describe their perceptions,\r\nexpectations and concerns with regard to the all-\r\nencompassing manifestations of globalization. Last\r\nyear, my predecessor stated that the United Nations\r\nwas all about institutionalized solidarity. Bearing this\r\nidea in mind, we are convinced that the United Nations\r\nshould reshape its role in such a way as to manage\r\nglobalization in the interest of all nations and to correct\r\nits excesses.\r\nGlobalization creates opportunities for\r\ncommercial, economic and financial expansion.\r\nHowever, improved technological competitiveness and\r\nwider economic freedom do not automatically produce\r\ngreater equity.\r\nThe contribution of globalization to the\r\nbetterment of the human condition will remain limited\r\nto a small number of individuals, social categories and\r\ncountries unless it is oriented towards the common\r\ngood. This implies that, in the new context of\r\nintegration and participation in the globalization\r\nprocesses, good governance should intelligently and\r\npredictably combine economic reforms with social\r\nresponsibility, adjust the system of education and\r\nprofessional training, and initiate institutional reforms\r\nthat are able to achieve long-term internal stability and\r\nemployment, individual security and social justice, and\r\nthe protection of national economic interests, resources\r\nand the environment.\r\nThe process of globalization creates a new\r\nbalance of power between States, non-governmental\r\norganizations and transnational corporations. What is\r\nin question today is how to use their potential in order\r\nto influence the course of globalization so that it can\r\nhave a much more positive impact on people’s lives.\r\nThis means bringing globalization closer to the people\r\nby promoting human values and democratic principles\r\nand practices; an open, inclusive and pluralistic\r\npolitical culture; economies that sustain a decent life\r\nfor all citizens and prosperity for societies as a whole;\r\nand institutions that protect both individuals, with all\r\ntheir rights and fundamental freedoms, and the\r\ncommon good. Nothing can really benefit the citizens\r\nof a country if, at the same time, it prejudices the\r\nprevailing international standards of a democratic\r\nworld.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe need to pool our efforts in order to enlarge the\r\nsystem of values shared by the international\r\ncommunity. In this globalized yet conflictual world, the\r\nmanifestation of solidarity can provide a sound basis\r\nfor progress and prosperity for individuals and nations.\r\nFrom this perspective, I am convinced that solidarity in\r\nthe creation and allocation of educational capital is\r\nessential for the access of young people to the\r\nopportunities for progress engendered by globalization.\r\nI strongly support better access for young people to the\r\nnew technologies based on information and\r\ncommunication through investments in informatics\r\neducation, based on firm partnerships among\r\nGovernments, business communities and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. In coping with the new\r\ninformatics reality of globalization, good governance\r\nhas to act with vision, responsibility and solidarity.\r\nAccess to educational capital in computer sciences\r\nshould not create new demarcation lines across the\r\nplanet, but rather should unite the world, primarily\r\nyoung people, by providing new opportunities for\r\nprogress, communication and professional success.\r\nAccess to digital education will also mean civic\r\nemancipation, greater transparency and less corruption.\r\nThe first key word — solidarity — that I have\r\ntried to illustrate should be accompanied by a second:\r\nresponsibility. For the United Nations as a whole and\r\nfor its Member States, responsibility is another way to\r\nreact to the forces of globalization, both domestically\r\nand internationally. That is why Romania welcomes the\r\nset of priorities and recommendations formulated by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report to the Millennium\r\nAssembly.\r\nMember States know that responsibility requires\r\nthem to give the Organization — in what I would call a\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\n“peace ritual” — the political support and concrete\r\nmeans necessary to improve the management of\r\nglobalization and to fulfil its mandate. This role is not\r\nan easy one. In an era of the most advanced\r\ntechnological capabilities, poverty continues to be a\r\npainful reality. While there is increasing acceptance of\r\nthe universality of human rights, innocent people\r\ncontinue to fall victim to inter-ethnic wars. In fighting\r\nterrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, States\r\nfind that the perpetrators are as well-armed as their\r\npolice forces. The lack of determination or promptness\r\nin preventing the degradation of the environment\r\nendangers life on our planet. The United Nations must\r\nstrive to give globalization a human face.\r\nWithin our own Organization, responsibility also\r\nmeans that we have to strengthen the authority of the\r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security; pursue the process of reforming the\r\nSecurity Council, once we have agreed that an increase\r\nin its membership is justified; be more effective in\r\nassisting Member States to cope with their serious\r\neconomic and social problems; and enhance the\r\nOrganization’s capacity to mount and deploy peace\r\nmissions on a timely basis.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed the increasing\r\nrole of non-governmental organizations and other non-\r\nstate actors, in particular the powerful transnational\r\ncorporations. There is a need for them to assume\r\nincreased responsibility as well. Non-governmental\r\norganizations should be prepared to mobilize more\r\neffectively the resources of civil society in the service\r\nof the public well-being.\r\nAs for the transnational corporations, we are\r\naware of their role in stimulating the forces of\r\nglobalization and also in reaping its fruit. It is only fair\r\nfor them to assume responsibilities beyond the borders\r\nof their profit. There is a long way to go, so it is high\r\ntime to set out in this particular direction.\r\nThe Global Compact initiative launched by the\r\nSecretary-General should be built upon. In Romania,\r\nwe have already explored its potential and the results\r\nare promising. We believe, indeed, that the business\r\ncommunity can enhance support and enact a set of core\r\nvalues in the areas of human rights, labour standards\r\nand environmental protection. After all, profit is\r\nmeaningless if it does not lead to the improvement of\r\nthe human condition for all.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe believe that all Member States, including\r\nRomania, can assume a share of the collective\r\nresponsibility. Indeed, my country is doing its best to\r\nmake its own contribution to the goals and purposes of\r\nthe United Nations. First, Romania is party to the\r\nmajority of the key multilateral treaties and\r\nconventions identified as such by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the context of the Millennium Summit.\r\nSecondly, we submitted a valuable resolution,\r\nentitled “Promoting and consolidating democracy”, that\r\nwas adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on\r\n25 April this year. Encouraged by its success, we will\r\ninvite the General Assembly to adopt this resolution at\r\nthe current session. We are convinced that all members\r\nof the General Assembly are prepared to reiterate their\r\nrecognition of the values, principles and practices that\r\ngive meaning to a democratic society.\r\nThirdly, Romania is a strong supporter of the\r\nUnited Nations role in peacekeeping. Our peacekeepers\r\nhave served in various places where we had no specific\r\nnational interest other than maintaining peace on behalf\r\nof the world and of the innocent people who make up\r\nthe majority of victims of conflicts and disputes. We\r\nhave worked hard to diversify our contribution to\r\npeacekeeping. Romania is also proud to be part of the\r\nfirst Multinational Stand-by Forces High-Readiness\r\nBrigade. That is a clear way of expressing support for\r\nenhancing the United Nations capacity to deploy\r\npeacekeepers rapidly and effectively. In the same\r\ncontext, we welcome the work of the Panel on United\r\nNations peace operations, which has provided a\r\nconvincing outline for an important reform of this\r\nparticular function.\r\nFourthly, we also believe that the time has come\r\nfor us to try to review the peacekeeping scale of\r\nassessments. As a concrete contribution to this effort, I\r\ntake this opportunity to announce that Romania is\r\nwilling to gradually move from Group C to Group B of\r\nthe assessment mechanism for peacekeeping. We\r\nappeal to all Member countries to work together to put\r\nan end to the current financial crisis.\r\nFifthly, in the same vein, let me emphasize that\r\nRomania has increased its voluntary contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme’s work in our\r\ncountry. This is one way of reiterating our support for\r\nand interest in the operational activities of the United\r\nNations.\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nWe have always supported creative and efficient\r\nforms of cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations. I am pleased to announce to this\r\naudience that Romania is preparing to take over the\r\nhigh responsibility of the chairmanship of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) in 2001. We will work hard to make OSCE a\r\nmore instrumental organization, based upon a specific\r\ncommitment to improving the life of the citizens of its\r\n54 participating States. At the same time, we will use\r\nto its best the potential for dialogue and cooperation\r\nbetween OSCE and the United Nations in conflict-\r\nprevention and crisis management, in strengthening\r\ndemocratic institutions and the rule of law, in fighting\r\ncorruption and in other realms of common interest.\r\nHaving said this, I would make a plea to Member\r\nStates to integrate the two essential ingredients for\r\neffective action, namely solidarity and responsibility,\r\ninto the concept of total diplomacy. This means the\r\nsystematic use of firm and efficient diplomacy that\r\nshould be called upon before any dangerous tensions\r\nburst into conflict. It also means that we should give\r\nabsolute priority to diplomacy, prevention and\r\ncontainment, and in all circumstances use them\r\nextensively and comprehensively for the pacific\r\nsettlements of disputes. All of the means provided for\r\nin Chapter VI of the Charter and others that might be\r\ncreated through our collective effort of imagination\r\nshould reinforce the Organization’s capacity to cope\r\nwith threats and conflicts, whether predictable or\r\nunpredictable.\r\nRecent developments in longstanding conflicts\r\nand disputes confirm that at the end of any road paved\r\nwith a heavy toll in human lives, material destruction\r\nand distorted mentalities, one can find a negotiating\r\ntable. Diplomacy, if used up to the point of exhaustion,\r\ncan eventually prove decisive, provided all the\r\npossibilities of statesmen, professional negotiators,\r\npublic opinion and civil society are comprehensively\r\nmobilized. Intense dialogue, diplomacy and flexibility\r\nfrom all parties are still needed in critical points of the\r\nworld, such as Kosovo. Resolution 1244 (1999) of the\r\nSecurity Council is a remarkable innovation, which\r\ncombines the specific capabilities of the United\r\nNations and some prominent regional organizations\r\nsuch as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of\r\nEurope. Let us work together, guided by resolution\r\n1244, to use the diplomatic and material potential of\r\nthese organizations with full positive impact on all the\r\ninhabitants of this province, irrespective of ethnic\r\nbackground or religion.\r\nI address the same appeal to responsibility to the\r\nparties involved in the Transdneister tension problem,\r\nwith the hope that the commitments assumed during\r\nthe OSCE Summit in Istanbul will be respected, so that\r\nnext year we will see concrete measures in the\r\nwithdrawal of military troops and arms from this part\r\nof the Republic of Moldova.\r\nWe are aware that there are many complex and\r\nunsolved situations for which energetic enforcement is\r\nneeded. We are ready to participate in a profound and\r\nresponsible debate on humanitarian intervention. We\r\nwould join other delegations in taking a fresh look at\r\nthe use of sanctions and seeing how effective they are\r\nwith respect to their target and what are the\r\nconsequences on the innocent civilian population or\r\nthird countries.\r\nAmong the possible consequences, it is worth\r\nmentioning the irrational retaliation reactions from\r\ncountries concerned. A case in point is the perpetuation\r\nof the blocking of the Danube — the blocking of\r\nnavigation on the Danube — which makes all the\r\nriparian countries suffer. Procrastination, resisting the\r\nlifting of the blockade on the Danube under various\r\npretexts defies international law and ignores the\r\neconomic interests in the region. Every day, shipping\r\ncompanies accumulate huge losses, which add to the\r\nalready heavy burden on the third countries in the area,\r\naccumulated during the years of the Yugoslav crisis.\r\nSpeaking of the situation in the Balkans in\r\ngeneral, we have to say that we are far from having\r\nreached complete stability. We are still witnessing\r\nconfrontation between the forces of integration and\r\nthose of dissolution. Time has come to get rid of the\r\nghosts of intolerance and hatred and open the door to\r\nthe fresh air of the European spirit of integration. The\r\nresults of the actions by the inflexible regime in\r\nBelgrade can be clearly seen today. Unfortunately, our\r\nneighbours are forced to cope with a destroyed and\r\nisolated economy and an unpredictable political\r\nsituation in a Yugoslav State once viable and respected,\r\nyet finding itself, today, in a process of dismantlement.\r\nPolitics should be judged by its results, and not by its\r\nintentions. We strongly wish for Yugoslavia to return to\r\nthe European mainstream, for which it must re-embrace\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nthe values of democracy, tolerance and freedom of\r\nexpression.\r\nThe historic conflict in the Middle East is not\r\nover yet, but it is diplomacy that still gives us hope for\r\na solution. I applaud the recent efforts made by the\r\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders to come closer to a final\r\nsettlement. This year we have also heard good news\r\nfrom the Korean Peninsula, a part of the world where\r\nhistory separated one people into two hostile parts.\r\nRomania is happy to see a fresh wave of diplomatic\r\nactions and human contacts that open new windows for\r\nan era of which the Korean people would be the first\r\nbeneficiary.\r\nFor us it is obvious that total diplomacy can be\r\nsuccessful if it is constantly and solidly based on\r\nhuman realities and on the fundamental aspiration of\r\nordinary people to a peaceful and decent life. With the\r\ncurrent, unprecedented level of knowledge we have\r\nreached, I am confident that we can find, in ourselves\r\nand our societies, resources for greater tolerance,\r\nmutual respect and dialogue, as opposed to the\r\nprimitive inclination to hatred, intolerance and\r\naggression.\r\nIt is incumbent to the United Nations, as the only\r\ninternational organization of universal vocation, to\r\nidentify new resources for our concerted endeavours to\r\nfind solutions to problems of global concern. I am glad\r\nto see that our position coincides in many respects with\r\nthe major ideas agreed upon by participants in the\r\nSummit. The United Nations should stubbornly keep\r\nworking to renew its profile and vigour while entering\r\nthe new millennium. Romania will continue to be ready\r\nto add its contribution to that effect.\r\nThe Acting President (Tunisia) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I now give the floor to the next speaker, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdul Ilah El-Khatib, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\r\nMr. El-Khatib (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to extend my congratulations to His\r\nExcellency on his election as President of the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly, wishing him all\r\nsuccess in conducting its deliberations and in arriving\r\nat conclusions beneficial to the international\r\ncommunity. I would like also to express our deep\r\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on\r\nhis successful efforts in conducting the business of the\r\nfifty-fourth session. Furthermore, I would like to\r\nexpress my appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\nSecretary-General of our Organization, for his report\r\nand his incessant efforts in the service of the purposes\r\nand principles of the Organization, with a view to\r\nenhancing its role and increasing its effectiveness in\r\nthe international arena.\r\nThe General Assembly holds its fifty-fifth session\r\nin the wake of the Millennium Summit, which\r\nwitnessed a historic meeting of world leaders held\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. The\r\nsignificance and meaning of the Summit affirm the\r\ncommitment of the international community to the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. This\r\nshould lead to the enhancement of its role as the best\r\nframework for providing Member States with suitable\r\nmechanisms to organize and regulate international\r\nrelations on the basis of cooperative partnership,\r\nparticularly after the end of the cold war era and its\r\nconcepts of polarization and balance of power, which\r\nhad in the past instituted division and confrontation,\r\ndepleted huge resources and caused widespread\r\nsuffering in vast areas of the world.\r\nSince the establishment of the United Nations the\r\nworld has witnessed developments that require a\r\nreview of the methods and policies adopted so far.\r\nFirst, calls for democracy and efforts to establish it and\r\nmake it a way of life within States should be consistent\r\nwith the establishment of democracy in international\r\nrelations and within the United Nations itself. It is not\r\nlogical to continue urging and calling for the\r\nestablishment of democracy on one level while\r\nrejecting it on the international arena, where in fact\r\nthere is a dire need for democracy in order to achieve\r\nequality among the Members of this organization —\r\nrich and poor, strong and weak.\r\nDuring the past few years the United Nations has\r\nwitnessed some changes in its methods of work. First\r\nand foremost we must emphasize the need to preserve\r\nthe role of the General Assembly. The power of the\r\nSecurity Council, the executive arm of the Assembly\r\nfor peace and security issues, should not be increased\r\nat the expense of the role of the General Assembly and\r\nits various other organs, which are supposed to provide\r\nbalance and collective representation of the\r\ninternational will.\r\nClearly, there is international consensus that the\r\npresent composition of the Security Council does not\r\nprovide equitable representation of the international\r\ncommunity and that there is a need to correct this\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nsituation. Since all States have expressed their\r\npositions through extended debates, the actions\r\nrequired have become clearer and more specific.\r\nAll Member States, both developed and\r\ndeveloping, agree that globalization and the abolition\r\nof borders and obstacles to economic exchanges\r\npresent opportunities and pose risks. Although\r\nglobalization facilitates the flow of goods and services\r\nas well as of ideas, it has presented the developing\r\nworld with challenges related to deepening the gap\r\nbetween it and the developed world, particularly in\r\nview of differences in their respective levels of\r\nscientific and technological development.\r\nGlobalization has also put the identity and\r\nsovereignty of developing States and peoples to a\r\npainful test. Additionally, it has shown how difficult it\r\nis for developing countries to meet the requirements of\r\nintegration into the world economy. While a majority\r\nof developing countries were struggling to enter the\r\nindustrial era, they witnessed the entry of the\r\ndeveloped world into an era of information technology.\r\nWhile they were striving to provide basic services, like\r\ninfrastructure, health care, social welfare and\r\neducation, they witnessed the frightening acceleration\r\nof technological and economic changes — a\r\nphenomenon that thwarted their hopes of catching up\r\nwith developed countries.\r\nWhile globalization, openness and economic\r\nintegration make the world a unified economic\r\nenvironment, widening differences and deepening\r\ninequalities will inescapably cause damage to all in the\r\nlong run. This situation makes it imperative to\r\nreformulate economic relations on the basis of\r\ncooperation and partnership. It also requires action to\r\nreduce differences, rectify economic imbalances and\r\nhelp developing countries adjust their economies to\r\nmeet the requirements of globalization and integration.\r\nFurthermore, the experience of mankind has proved\r\nthat poverty and huge economic and social disparities\r\nhave always been the root causes of instability and\r\nconfrontation.\r\nThe Middle East peace process is going through\r\nan extremely sensitive phase. During the past few\r\nweeks and months, major, commendable efforts have\r\nbeen made to make Palestinian-Israeli negotiations\r\nbear fruit — arriving at a lasting settlement between\r\nthe two parties.\r\nJordan has made an essential contribution in all\r\nphases of the peace process. This contribution was\r\nmotivated by Jordan’s conviction that peace is the only\r\nreal option for all States and peoples of the region.\r\nIndeed, geographic and demographic realities make it\r\nimpossible for any party to settle the conflict by\r\nimposing its will or consecrating the status quo in its\r\nfavour. Therefore, there is no alternative to establishing\r\npeace on the basis of law, international legitimacy,\r\njustice and equality.\r\nDespite the failure of the recent Camp David\r\nsummit to produce an agreement between the\r\nPalestinians and the Israelis, it has enabled the parties\r\nto narrow the gap dividing their positions and made the\r\nrequirements for reaching a settlement clearer. This\r\nconfirms the need to continue the efforts by the United\r\nStates in particular and the international community in\r\ngeneral to build on what has been achieved so far.\r\nThe achievement of lasting peace in the region\r\nrequires the realization of the national rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, primarily the right to independence\r\nand the establishment of their State on their national\r\nterritory, with the Holy City of Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThis means reaching implementable and\r\nsustainable solutions to the main issues, which are the\r\nsubject of the permanent-status negotiations. Regarding\r\nthe issue of territory, Israeli forces must withdraw from\r\nthe Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 242\r\n(1967), so that a Palestinian state may be established\r\non those territories, with internationally recognized\r\nborders. Any security arrangements that may be agreed\r\nupon must not be based on any claim of sovereignty as\r\na result of occupation.\r\nThe solution of the refugee problem must also be\r\nbased on rules of international law and the various\r\ninternational conventions and on the basis of General\r\nAssembly resolution 194 (III), which emphasizes the\r\nright of return and compensation to the refugees.\r\nPersons who were displaced as a result of the June\r\n1967 war must be able to return to their homes in\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 237\r\n(1967).\r\nThe issue of Jerusalem is the key to peace in the\r\nregion, and it must be solved on the premise that East\r\nJerusalem is Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\r\nto which resolution 242 (1967) applies. East Jerusalem\r\nshould be under Palestinian sovereignty so that it may\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nbecome the capital of the independent State of\r\nPalestine. Arab and Muslim rights to the Islamic and\r\nChristian holy places in Jerusalem must be preserved.\r\nIn no way can Israeli sovereignty over these holy\r\nplaces be accepted.\r\nThe status of Jerusalem and its spiritual and\r\nreligious importance make it imperative that the city be\r\nan open city where freedom of worship and access to\r\nthe holy places is guaranteed for all believers in God.\r\nJordan has suffered immensely during the past\r\nfive decades as a result of the situation arising from the\r\nPalestine question, particularly the refugee problem.\r\nThere are more than 1.5 million refugees living in\r\nJordan. This amounts to 41 per cent of all refugees\r\nregistered with the United Nations Relief and Works\r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\n(UNRWA). This is in addition to the people displaced\r\nas a result of the June 1967 war. As a result of the\r\nrefugee situation, Jordan has shouldered heavy\r\nfinancial, economic and social burdens.\r\nJordan will be subject to pressures that will\r\nthreaten its stability and that of the region if the\r\nsettlement does not satisfy its legitimate vital interests.\r\nRefugees and displaced persons in Jordan will only\r\naccept a settlement that recognizes their fundamental\r\nrights to return and to compensation.\r\nIt is well known that the vast majority of these\r\nrefugees have Jordanian citizenship as a result of the\r\nunity that was established between the Hashemite\r\nKingdom of Jordan and the West Bank in 1950. The\r\ndeclaration of unity at the time provided for the\r\npreservation of all Arab rights in Palestine and for the\r\ninalienability of the rights of the refugees.\r\nUpholding the right of return will, therefore,\r\nenable every refugee to exercise freely his or her\r\npersonal choice. Jordan must safeguard and preserve\r\nthe rights of its citizens, which is its responsibility\r\nunder national and international laws. Any solution that\r\ndoes not satisfy the rights of Jordan and its citizens will\r\nnot lead to the establishment of a just and lasting\r\npeace.\r\nSince the question of the refugees and their\r\ncontinued suffering has caused grave damage to Jordan\r\nand placed heavy burdens on it, Jordan demands\r\nrectification of the damage and losses that it has\r\nincurred. This rectification needs to include suitable\r\nand adequate compensation. Jordan will endeavour, by\r\nall possible means, to ensure that its legitimate claims\r\nwith regard to this issue are considered.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the Jordanian-Israeli\r\npeace treaty stipulates that the solution of the refugee\r\nproblem must be based on international law and that it\r\nshould be dealt with bilaterally and in parallel with the\r\npermanent status negotiations. It also established a\r\nmechanism to deal with all financial claims between\r\nthe two parties.\r\nThe rights of refugees and displaced persons to\r\nreturn and to compensation, and the rights of Jordan\r\nunder international law and the resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy, take precedence over other\r\nconsiderations. Jordan, therefore, will only accept a\r\nsettlement that will preserve its legitimate rights and\r\nensure a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region.\r\nOtherwise, the conflict will remain open and volatile,\r\nperpetuating the seeds of instability in the region. The\r\nposition of the refugees in Jordan is vital to the success\r\nof any settlement to be reached.\r\nAlso on the question of refugees, Jordan once\r\nagain emphasizes the importance of supporting\r\nUNRWA to enable it to carry out its mandate, which\r\nmust continue until a solution to this question is fully\r\nimplemented. Jordan, as host to the largest number of\r\nrefugees and the largest donor to UNWRA, expresses\r\nits appreciation of the Agency’s role and calls upon the\r\ninternational community to provide it with the needed\r\nfinancial resources to carry out its humanitarian tasks,\r\nparticularly at this sensitive phase of the peace process.\r\nIt also expresses appreciation to the donor States for\r\ntheir contributions.\r\nPeace in the Middle East cannot last unless it is\r\ncomprehensive. This makes the establishment of peace\r\non the Syrian track essential and a sine qua non for\r\npeace in the region as a whole. Negotiations on this\r\ntrack must, therefore, resume in order to reach an\r\nagreement ensuring the return to Syria of the occupied\r\nGolan Heights to the line of 4 June 1967 in\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nIsrael’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon on the\r\nbasis of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) is a\r\npositive development that will hopefully serve as a\r\nfoundation for the implementation of other Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, leading to the achievement of a\r\ncomprehensive peace in the region, which has suffered\r\nfor many decades from the depletion of its resources\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nand the energies of its peoples. Only peace will provide\r\nsecurity for all. It should lead to ending the arms race\r\nand to using the resources for the development of the\r\nregion and making it free from weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nTen years have passed since the beginning of the\r\nGulf crisis caused by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. As a\r\nresult, the region as a whole continues to suffer. Iraq\r\ncontinues to pay a heavy price as a result of continued\r\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on it, which caused\r\nand continue to cause unprecedented mass suffering for\r\nthe Iraqi people.\r\nJordan calls for launching a new thinking and a\r\nnew look at the situation in Iraq in order to put an end\r\nto the suffering of the Iraqi people, especially since the\r\ncollective sanctions, which are the severest of their\r\nkind in United Nations history, have not achieved their\r\ngoal of consolidating peace and security. They have\r\ninstead led to results that, in the long run, will give rise\r\nto dangers threatening the region as a whole. The need\r\nto implement and comply with Security Council\r\nresolutions does not conflict with the maintenance of\r\nIraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, nor with\r\nrefraining from action that violates those resolutions.\r\nIraq is an integral part of the region and its continued\r\nsubjugation affects security and stability in the region\r\nas a whole. Jordan calls for the settlement of all matters\r\nrelated to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on the basis of full\r\nimplementation of relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, including those dealing with Kuwaiti and\r\nother prisoners of war, and missing persons.\r\nJordan continues to suffer severe economic\r\nhardships as a result of compliance with relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Large segments of\r\nJordan’s economy have, as a result, sustained huge\r\nlosses. It is, therefore, imperative to put an end to the\r\nnegative effects of the sanctions on Jordan by showing\r\nbetter understanding of its situation, reviewing the\r\npolicies and methods used in dealing with the sanctions\r\nregime and giving a more just interpretation to the\r\nrelevant resolutions.\r\nBecause of our strong belief in the role of the\r\nUnited Nations, Jordanian armed forces participate\r\neffectively in its peacekeeping operations in several\r\nareas around the world. As a result, Jordan today is the\r\nsecond largest troop contributor to peacekeeping\r\noperations. While commending the report (A/55/305)\r\nof Mr. Brahimi’s Panel on United Nations peace\r\noperations, Jordan wishes to reiterate the need for the\r\nprovision of adequate means and resources to enable\r\npeacekeepers to achieve their noble objectives. We call\r\nfor a constructive and thorough discussion of the report\r\nin order to produce the best possible means to attain\r\nthat goal. In this spirit, we underscore the importance\r\nof conducting consultations with States that contribute\r\nto peacekeeping operations, before the adoption of\r\nmajor decisions concerning and affecting the status of\r\ntheir forces.\r\nOn another note, we feel that the startling\r\ndevelopments witnessed by our world today, at various\r\nlevels, make it increasingly necessary to rely on the\r\nUnited Nations to develop and establish norms in all\r\nmatters pertaining to human security. The ongoing\r\ndialogue on the need to establish complementarity and\r\nbalance between State sovereignty and human rights\r\nonly reflects the importance of this issue. Sovereignty\r\nshould not provide a cover for violating human rights.\r\nHence, greater emphasis should be placed on the\r\nimportance of objectivity, non-selectivity and\r\nimpartiality when dealing with human rights issues.\r\nIt is illogical to continue to keep silent about the\r\nsuffering of whole nations whose dignity is being\r\nundermined and whose human rights are being\r\nviolated, while prominence is almost always given to\r\nother partial issues for purely political considerations.\r\nWith the onset of the third millennium the world\r\nis entering a new epoch that necessitates the formation\r\nof a new pattern of relations in the international arena\r\nbased on our collective responsibility to develop and\r\nsafeguard what has been achieved so far. Our world\r\nneeds to establish a new paradigm of international\r\nrelations based not on confrontation and exclusion, but\r\non new foundations of openness and real partnership.\r\nIntegration, which encompasses the overlapping\r\nand interdependence of interests, presupposes\r\npartnership and solidarity among nations to help them\r\nmanage change and ease the lack of confidence and\r\nhesitation associated with the fear of failure. The\r\ninternational community’s willingness to encourage\r\nand support the will to change will certainly reinforce\r\nthe capacity to deal with such change with minimum\r\nlosses and convince those taking such a risk that\r\ntoday’s world is not based on a zero-sum option and\r\nthat the challenge that we all face is: How can man,\r\nregardless of ethnic background, economic situation or\r\nreligious belief be the primary beneficiary of the\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\ndevelopment achieved by humanity in modern times?\r\nThis is the acid test we all face today. Will we succeed?\r\nThe President (spoke in French): The next\r\nspeaker is His Excellency Mr. George Papandreou,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Greece.\r\nMr. Papandreou (Greece): I express my sincere\r\ncongratulations to the President on his election. I am\r\ncertain his qualities and skills will bring a successful\r\nconclusion to the fifty-fifth session. May I also extend\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, his\r\npredecessor, on what he achieved. Finally, I endorse\r\nthe European Union’s priorities paper, which was\r\ndeveloped by Hubert Vedrine, the President of the\r\nCouncil of the European Union.\r\nSome believe that violence might be an intrinsic\r\npart of humanity. But so are humanity’s relentless\r\nefforts to rule out violence, regulate antagonism,\r\npeacefully resolve confrontational situations and\r\nprevent hatred and prejudice. Whether we come\r\ntogether to understand each other or to debate each\r\nother, our goal has always been to better our lives and\r\nbuild a more secure future.\r\nSince ancient times, we have attempted to\r\nestablish norms of peaceful coexistence. In this effort,\r\nwe have built traditions and religions, as well as\r\npolitical structures. Through these norms we have tried\r\nto battle a fate seemingly dictated by force, poverty,\r\noppression, prejudice, chronic and communicable\r\ndiseases, inequality and a withering environment.\r\nThroughout history, our efforts have taken\r\nvarious forms. But they have all commenced with a\r\nunique first step: the overriding principle that, in order\r\nto solve our problems, we need to work together.\r\nThis month is being marked by two events that\r\nwill bring the peoples of our world much closer: the\r\nMillennium Assembly and the Olympic Games. At the\r\ndawn of the twenty-first century, nations will meet,\r\ncompete, clash, differ and disagree. Yet our world has\r\nnever looked more united or more determined to tackle\r\nits problems as one, indivisible community.\r\nIn the current environment, our efforts to build a\r\nbetter world for our children can and ought to be pan-\r\ncosmic. We can all contribute to a future that inspires\r\nour children and inspires the will to grow and to create.\r\nAs the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has very\r\nwisely said,\r\n“We face global challenges which oblige us\r\nto work together. If that is true in the economic\r\nand social sphere, it applies even more to the\r\nchallenge of massacre and war”.\r\nThese words command even more authority coming\r\nfrom a man whose political skill, moral authority and\r\ndevotion have contributed, in numerous cases, to the\r\nresolution of conflicting issues.\r\nWhen a child misses its childhood and its\r\neducation because it is in a dark prison cell, when a\r\nchild is maimed from the explosion of a mine or when\r\na child dies of hunger, of AIDS or in war, we do not\r\nwitness just a tragic event. We do not witness only the\r\nsad state of some distant community. In today’s world,\r\nwhen we see a child die, we lose another ray of hope\r\nthat our global community will come together as one,\r\nthat we shall live in peace and that we will finally\r\ntackle the challenges we all face together.\r\nIn Greece, we have become deeply conscious of\r\nthis reality. What goes on in our neighbourhood\r\ndirectly affects the way in which our children will grow\r\nand develop. So we have made a commitment to our\r\nworld and, more specifically, to our region, and it is\r\nthis commitment that I have come to share with the\r\nAssembly today.\r\nThe two global events of this September — this\r\nAssembly and the Olympic Games — symbolize the\r\nbeginning of an era for my country. After this\r\nministerial week of the General Assembly, Greece will\r\nraise the Olympic flag in Sydney. For the second time\r\nin almost a century, the international community will\r\nbestow upon Athens the responsibility of the\r\nOlympiad.\r\nOver the next four years, Athens has committed\r\nitself to run both an athletic and a cultural Olympiad.\r\nToday, I commit our county to an Olympiad for peace:\r\nfour years of the most relentless efforts and a\r\ncommitment to the international community to fight\r\nagainst the evils that have kept our community of\r\nnations at war, under totalitarianism and under\r\noppression.\r\nI pledge today that when the Olympic flame of\r\nour ancestors rises over the Athenian sky, it will light\r\nup more than a shiny stadium. It will light up a whole\r\narea of fighting for peace, democracy and justice. The\r\nnext four years — the years that coincide with this\r\nGreek Olympiad — will set of the stage upon which\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nthe future event will unfold. The globalization of the\r\neconomy, the increased power of the media and rapid\r\ndevelopments in information technology,\r\ncommunications and biotechnology are just some of\r\nthese new challenges.\r\nGlobalization, while creating incredible wealth\r\nfor many, fosters conditions for conflict and poverty.\r\nThe new economy cannot be dominated by interests,\r\nand must be monitored to promote both democracy and\r\nhuman security. For the next four years, Greece will\r\ntake an active role in international forums to do its part\r\nin dealing with this problem of globalization. That is\r\nwhy Greece has also enthusiastically accepted an\r\ninvitation to join the Human Security Network.\r\nHuman rights laws alone cannot provide for\r\nhuman rights; they must be strengthened by civic\r\nresponsibility and democratic institutions. We need to\r\ncreate structures that will reach beyond the democratic\r\ndeficits of the global community. We need to create\r\nregional cooperation, build civic structures and\r\ncommunity services and work with non-governmental\r\norganizations. We need to educate our citizens and our\r\nsocieties in making this process their own and allow\r\ntheir voice to be heard.\r\nThis, in our view, is the role of the United\r\nNations. This honourable Organization can and must\r\nbridge the gap between the global challenges we face\r\nand the democratic deficits that exist in our global\r\nculture. We believe that now is the time to turn the\r\nUnited Nations from an Organization working to\r\nglobalize democracy into an Organization that is also\r\nable to democratize the process of globalization. The\r\nMillennium Summit agenda is proof that the\r\ninternational community shares these views.\r\nInitiatives taken within the United Nations can\r\nmake our world a better place. Let me use a single but\r\npowerful example. On 7 September, nations were\r\ninvited to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on the\r\ninvolvement of children in armed conflicts.\r\nWhatever the causes of modern-day brutality\r\ntowards children, the time has come to call for a halt —\r\nto call for a truce. The most fundamental principle is\r\nthat children should have no part in war. This is only\r\none of the initiatives that Greece will actively support\r\nin the international arena in the coming years.\r\nAt the same time, our view of the purpose of\r\ninternational organizations comes from the rich\r\nexperience we have amassed in our region. Starting\r\nwith the war in Kosovo, my country has been deeply\r\ninvolved in the events unfolding in the area. We\r\nbelieve that the lessons of this involvement can greatly\r\ncontribute to the work of these organizations. We are\r\neager to share our experience with the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe believe that stability in our region is a\r\nprerequisite for Greek security, and we define stability\r\nto mean the practice of democracy, the strengthening of\r\ninstitutions that provide transparency and\r\naccountability, the reduction of economic inequalities\r\nand the rule of law in our societies and between our\r\ncountries. Our security lies in being a member of the\r\nEuropean Union and of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization, and we work so that countries in the\r\nregion may benefit from the stabilizing influence of\r\ntheir future membership in these institutions.\r\nDuring the Kosovo war, my colleagues in\r\nneighbouring countries and I decided to cooperate\r\nclosely to alleviate human suffering and avoid further\r\ninstability in our region. We grew to understand that\r\nour fates were intrinsically linked. As a result, we were\r\ncompelled to discover ways to increase our cooperation\r\nand effectiveness in dealing with our problems. We\r\nwould otherwise have been condemned to constant\r\nstrife, conflict and isolation in the world. In the next\r\nfour years, Greece will build upon this base. We are\r\ndetermined to transform the plight of a war and its\r\nbrutal memories into an opportunity for generations to\r\ncome.\r\nThrough this process, I hope that Greece has\r\nmanaged to inspire in the international community the\r\nimportance of a consistent, universal and unifying\r\npolicy towards South-Eastern Europe. From Bosnia to\r\nCyprus, we have the same objectives: we want the\r\ncountries in the region to be integral, peaceful and\r\ndemocratic; we want them to remain multicultural; and\r\nwe want them to join the European Union. Yugoslavia,\r\ntoo, is an essential part of this political framework. We\r\nstrongly desire to see the return of Yugoslavia to\r\nEurope. I would like to endorse my Romanian\r\ncolleague’s call to rethink our policy on sanctions,\r\nwhich often do more to serve purposes contrary to\r\nthose for which we are striving.\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nThat is our message. Even though it is simple\r\nsounding, our message is a radical break from the past,\r\nwhen favouritism, cold-war intricacies and double\r\nstandards consistently broke the spirit of the people in\r\nthe region. Now is the time to put an end to that. We\r\nmust stop redrawing borders around ethnically\r\nhomogeneous communities while compelling them to\r\nseek the favours of greater Powers. In the next four\r\nyears, we will commit Greece to an effort to transform\r\nthe multitude of races, religions and ethnicities in the\r\nregion into an instrument of solidarity and stability —\r\na beautiful kaleidoscope of creative, multicultural\r\ncooperation.\r\nGreece’s vision for the Balkans is one of a region\r\nin which democracy finally becomes the norm; where\r\ncitizens’ aspirations can finally be realized through\r\npeaceful and democratic practices; where the rights of\r\nminorities are respected; and where Governments are\r\naccountable, economies are transparent and politics\r\nallow for the fullest participation of all elements of\r\nsociety.\r\nThe world has a responsibility in supporting this\r\nvision for our region. We need to empower the region,\r\nwhich has historically been handicapped, dependent\r\nand divided by a world community of competing\r\ninterests and a babble of conflicting signals. This\r\nbalkanization of the region must be replaced by\r\ncoordination of international efforts.\r\nThis is why we have actively supported and\r\npromoted this new vision within the international\r\ncommunity. Last year our efforts helped more than 40\r\ncountries develop a unique contract between the\r\ninternational community and south-eastern Europe. The\r\ncontract was coined the Stability Pact. We have a clear\r\nsense of how the Stability Pact can achieve its goals\r\nand it is an optimistic sign that the European Union,\r\nthe United States and Russia cooperate closely within\r\nits framework. Regional integration can also be\r\nachieved as the Stability Pact promotes investment in\r\ninfrastructure projects. Education is a primary goal and\r\na strategy for democratic leadership and institution-\r\nbuilding, which will stimulate economic growth and\r\nwill bring us together. The pact actively promotes\r\nrespect for the rule law among States and peoples in\r\nthe region.\r\nOur stand in international organizations and our\r\nagenda for the next four years is coloured also by our\r\nrecent experience with Turkey. The earthquakes that\r\nshook Greece and Turkey a year ago created a new\r\nclimate for the first time in our recent history. Tragedy\r\ngenerated a genuine feeling of human warmth.\r\nSpontaneous and dramatic acts of fraternity and\r\nsolidarity were expressed. Our mandate was clear. Our\r\npeoples desire to live in peace together.\r\nSince the earthquakes, Greeks and Turks are\r\nusing every opportunity to explore their newly found\r\nneighbours, and to come together, meet, exchange\r\nexperiences and make up for lost time. On a bilateral\r\nlevel we have signed 10 agreements that will radically\r\nchange the environment in which we interact; in one\r\nyear, 10 agreements. We do not view these\r\ndevelopments as a momentary result of what was lately\r\ncoined as seismic diplomacy. We view them as the\r\nbeginning of a long process that will radically affect\r\nour lives in the coming years.\r\nWe have opened a dialogue; one that is honest.\r\nAnd although we may differ and do differ on many\r\nissues, such as how we see Cyprus or how we approach\r\nour bilateral relations, this open approach can only lead\r\nto a progressive resolution of our problems. When I\r\nspeak today I know that those of the Turkish side will\r\nnot or may not agree on many issues. But they know\r\nwe are honest. We are honest in what we say and in our\r\ndesire for a new and peaceful relation.\r\nI believe that Greece and Turkey have no choice\r\nbut to explore new avenues for cooperation. I believe\r\nour mutual interests can outweigh our political\r\ndifferences. We can and must resolve these differences\r\nthrough peaceful means; peaceful means of that of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nThe European Union’s decision to upgrade\r\nTurkey’s status to that of a candidate country in\r\nHelsinki in December marked an historic turning point\r\nin Greek-Turkish relations. Helsinki does not signal the\r\nend of Greece’s efforts; it represents the beginning of a\r\nnew and equally courageous Greek initiative. In this\r\ncontext, we are ready also to further discuss\r\nconfidence-building measures between Greece and\r\nTurkey.\r\nI do not want to give the false impression that all\r\nour problems have suddenly been resolved. It is also\r\nmost distressing that a variety of statements and acts\r\nstill undermine this genuine and difficult effort, and\r\nthere are those who certainly may wish that our efforts\r\nwill fail. It is our historical duty to overcome these\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\ndifficulties and maintain the momentum in response to\r\nour peoples’ mandate for peace.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General and\r\nall those who labour with him towards a just solution in\r\nCyprus: a solution based on United Nations resolutions\r\nfor a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation in one\r\ninternational personality, one citizenship and one\r\nsovereignty.\r\nAt this time, I would appeal to him to move\r\nforward with the peace talks on this basis. The\r\nimplementation of United Nations resolutions is not\r\nonly important for Cyprus. It is important for the moral\r\nstanding of this all-important Organization. Double\r\nstandards and inaction only serve to undermine the\r\ncredibility of this Organization in the eyes of so many\r\ncountries and peoples.\r\nOne cannot accept developments such as those\r\nthat recently took place in Strovilia. This responsibility\r\nrests with the United Nations, with the guarantor\r\npowers and all those who have a say in international\r\ndevelopments. It has become obvious that the current\r\nsituation in Cyprus and its occupation by foreign forces\r\nchallenges the integrity and credibility of this\r\nhonourable Organization. I know this term may be\r\npainful, but Cyprus is an occupied island, and this must\r\nend. We need to go beyond the situation and it will take\r\ncourage; courage from all involved.\r\nA solution to the Cyprus problem can and should\r\nbe seen as a win-win situation. It is vital for peace,\r\nstability and security in our region. I truly believe that\r\nthe Greek-Cypriot and the Turkish-Cypriot\r\ncommunities can find solutions, and we must allow\r\nthem to live together peacefully. We can aid them in\r\nthis process. Greece and Turkey can aid them. Cyprus\r\nwill either unite us or divide us, Greece and Turkey.\r\nWe have a responsibility to cooperate on Cyprus and to\r\nfacilitate the solution to this process. Greece and\r\nTurkey, through their rapprochement, share a rare\r\nopportunity to help the citizens of Cyprus rebuild their\r\nisland, their homes and their dreams. The outcome of\r\nthese efforts should be that every Cypriot enjoys safety,\r\nequality under the law, protection of their human\r\nrights, appropriate representation and security under a\r\nEuropean roof.\r\nCyprus, Turkey and Greece: for anyone willing to\r\nenvision the future, our futures are as interwoven as\r\nour histories. A reunified federal Cyprus, member of\r\nthe European Union, will not only serve the European\r\naspiration for stability in the region, but the aspirations\r\nof every citizen in every one of the countries involved.\r\nI extend my appeal to the Turkish Cypriots. We\r\nwant them near us, in our wider European family. In\r\nthis family we do not only guarantee them the\r\nsolidarity of the Greek people, but also the\r\ncommitment of the Greek Government. Our citizens\r\nwill only master the great possibilities that lie ahead if\r\nthis last wall in Cyprus comes tumbling down.\r\nOur experience in our region, our rapprochement\r\nwith Turkey and our consistent efforts for a just\r\nsolution in Cyprus have given Greece a new voice in\r\nthe international community. We treasure our new\r\ncapacity and intend to grow it further. During our\r\nOlympiad for Peace we plan to keep a close eye on\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East, always seeking\r\nmethods to facilitate the hopeful process. We shall\r\nfollow closely developments in the South and\r\nparticularly in Africa, a continent for which the Greek\r\npeople share a special place in their hearts. Our\r\nemphasis will be on children: their rights, their right to\r\navoid a violent life.\r\nOur concentration in our Olympiad for Peace will\r\nbe on international initiatives in which our country can\r\nplay a role. Drawing on our ancient traditions, we are\r\nworking to re-establish the practice of Olympic Truce.\r\nWe aspire to the day when the tradition of suspending\r\nall hostilities during the Olympic Games becomes the\r\nseed for a more lasting peace. Huge amounts of\r\nresources are wasted on military procurements and war,\r\nand they must be channelled into health, education,\r\nculture and sport. To this end and in close cooperation\r\nwith the International Olympic Committee and\r\nPresident Samaranch, we have established the\r\nInternational Centre for Olympic Truce in Greece.\r\nIn both ancient and modern Greek, the word for\r\ntruce is ekecheiria. It has a dual meaning. It means\r\nsetting one’s weapons aside, but it also means reaching\r\nout one’s hand in friendship. We do not simply aspire\r\nto a momentary truce, but to a continuous truce, an\r\nactive truce.\r\nThe concept of Olympic Truce can complement\r\nthe work of national and international organizations\r\nspecializing in conflict prevention and resolution and\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations\r\nsharing similar objectives. The Centre in Olympia will\r\noffer a sanctuary to support peace-building. This year\r\nwe hosted children from war-torn areas in the Balkans.\r\n36\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nTruce in Bosnia in 1992 allowed for children to be\r\ninoculated. Truce in Sidney this year will allow for\r\nNorth and South Korean teams to march under the\r\nsame flags: an historic moment.\r\nI started my address by saying that people coming\r\ntogether has always been the prerequisite for building a\r\nbetter world and a more secure future. I conclude by\r\nappeal to members. Take this ancient tradition, which\r\nby now is no longer exclusively Greek. It has become\r\nuniversal. Use this tool to complement efforts and\r\ninspire the younger generation for peace and\r\ncooperation, going beyond ethnic, racial, religious or\r\nother divisions.\r\nThis is the objective of the Olympic Truce. And\r\nthis is the foundation upon which Greece shall build its\r\nfour-year Olympiad for Peace.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I will\r\nnow call on His Excellency Mr. Josep Piqué, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Spain.\r\nMr. Piqué (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I wish\r\nsincerely to congratulate the President on his election\r\nto preside over the work of the Millennium Assembly. I\r\nwould also like to express my appreciation for the work\r\nof his predecessor, Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nwhich culminated in the recent Millennium Summit.\r\nI also welcome Tuvalu as a new Member State of\r\nthe United Nations. I am sure that it will make a useful\r\nand enriching contribution to the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWhat kind of United Nations do we want? Why,\r\nand to what purpose, do we need the United Nations in\r\nthis new millennium? The Millennium Summit was\r\nconvened to answer those questions. The task of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is to devise and implement the\r\nguidelines that the Summit proposed. Spain would like\r\nto suggest some ideas for progress in three of the\r\nOrganization’s basic spheres of action: managing\r\nglobalization, combating poverty and peace-making.\r\nThe United Nations that we want must be our\r\nmain instrument for meeting the many challenges of\r\nglobalization. Its universal nature places our\r\nOrganization in an ideal position for that purpose. It\r\nwould be unforgivable if it were not capable of rising\r\nto that task, which has to be undertaken in very\r\ndifferent fields. One such area is human rights. The\r\nprocess of the universalization of human rights\r\nconstitutes one of the United Nations most valuable\r\ncontributions to international relations since the\r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, in 1948. If the twentieth century has been one\r\nof formulating and structuring human rights on the\r\ninternational level, the next century must be that of\r\nensuring that their effective implementation is\r\nuniversal.\r\nThe practices in most urgent need of elimination\r\nare racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and\r\nintolerance. The 2001 World Conference against\r\nRacism must be an effective instrument to that end. We\r\nmust also strive to abolish the death penalty, which we\r\nconsider a punishment contrary to the dignity of the\r\nhuman being. The adoption of moratoriums against\r\ncarrying it out could be a first step towards its total\r\nban.\r\nOur Organization must also enable us to provide\r\nsolutions, in a spirit of solidarity, to humanitarian\r\nproblems that until recently have simply not been\r\naddressed. The consequences have been borne by\r\ndefenceless civilian populations. I refer to the situation\r\nof refugees and persons displaced within their own\r\ncountries, civilian victims of armed conflicts and\r\ninternational aid workers who are subject to threats or\r\ncoercion. It is essential to broaden the scope of our\r\naction in this area and to pay special attention to the\r\nmost vulnerable sectors of the population.\r\nLast week, in this very city, the President of the\r\nSpanish Government signed the two Optional Protocols\r\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child, relative\r\nto children in armed conflict and on the sale of\r\nchildren, child prostitution and child pornography. In\r\nthat same vein, the General Assembly this year adopted\r\na resolution (54/262) agreeing to the holding in Spain\r\nin 2002 of the Second World Assembly on Ageing. We\r\nshall do everything possible to ensure the success of\r\nsuch an important event.\r\nIn this overall context, we must mention the issue\r\nof so-called humanitarian intervention, aptly proposed\r\non more than one occasion by the Secretary-General.\r\nThe United Nations that we want cannot be an\r\nOrganization that remains paralysed in the face of\r\nmassive violations of human rights, wherever they may\r\ntake place. When that has occurred, its prestige has\r\nbeen seriously affected, and it has been left out of basic\r\ndecision-making in times of crisis. The disgust\r\nprovoked by a passive stance in the face of those\r\natrocities and the need to strengthen the role of the\r\n37\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nOrganization in crisis situations are merely two sides of\r\nthe same coin. It is essential that we be capable of\r\nbuilding consensus on at least two fundamental issues.\r\nThe first is actions regarding which the\r\ninternational community cannot remain idle, such as\r\nwar crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide,\r\nwhich are offences referred to in the Rome Statute of\r\nthe International Criminal Court. Consensus should\r\nalso be reached among the permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council over the cases in which they should\r\nrefrain from exercising their veto to block Council\r\nresolutions aimed at putting an end to massive\r\nviolations of human rights. The principle of State\r\nsovereignty continues to be essential in contemporary\r\ninternational society, but it must not be used as a\r\nprotective shield to trample upon human rights with\r\nimpunity.\r\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\r\nCourt signals the direction in which the international\r\ncommunity is moving in that area. The creation of an\r\ninternational system of criminal justice constitutes the\r\nmost important change in international law since the\r\nadoption of the San Francisco Charter. I am pleased to\r\ninform the Assembly that my country’s process of\r\nratification of the Rome Statute concluded yesterday. I\r\nhope that the International Criminal Court will become\r\na reality in the not-too-distant future. I trust therefore\r\nthat the Rome Statute will be signed and ratified by the\r\nlargest possible number of States, without directly or\r\nindirectly affecting its integrity and effectiveness.\r\nIf there is one issue that makes us realize that\r\nthere are global interests demanding our collective\r\nmanagement it is that of environmental protection. It is\r\nimperative that the Kyoto Protocol for combating the\r\ngreenhouse effect should come into force in 2002, at\r\nthe latest. Spain is a signatory of the Protocol, as well\r\nas of the agreements on the ozone layer, bio-diversity,\r\nbio-security and desertification — the latter problem\r\nbeing one which especially affects my country.\r\nUnfortunately, globalization has also generated\r\nfresh opportunities for the development of universal\r\nplagues such as terrorism and transnational organized\r\ncrime. However, globalization also provides us with\r\nnew instruments to combat them, provided we agree on\r\nhow to use them. Spain supports the drafting of a\r\ngeneral convention against international terrorism, and\r\nis grateful to India for its initiative in that respect. The\r\nwork aimed at the adoption of a convention against\r\ntransnational organized crime must also be concluded.\r\nOne of the United Nations top priorities is the\r\nfight against poverty. The Millennium Summit gave\r\nspecial attention to measures aimed at eradicating\r\npoverty. The specific implementation of those\r\nmeasures must be a basic aspect of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The United Nations that we want\r\nmust make it possible for developed and developing\r\ncountries to conclude agreements regarding the role\r\nthey must play in that task.\r\nThe high-level meetings that will be held in 2001\r\non financing for development and on the least\r\ndeveloped countries must not be wasted. Spain will\r\ncertainly do everything within its power to contribute\r\nto their success. My country follows the guidelines\r\nproduced by the World Summit for Social Development\r\nsuggesting that at least 20 per cent of cooperation\r\nresources be devoted to basic social sectors such as\r\nhealth, education, housing and employment, which\r\nhave the greatest impact on the most disadvantaged\r\nsectors of the population and, as a result, on the\r\neradication of poverty. Spain has prepared an ambitious\r\nmicrocredit programme aimed at meeting the needs of\r\nthe least favoured sectors of the population of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nLikewise, Spain has begun debt relief\r\nprogrammes in several countries, including\r\nMozambique and the Central American countries most\r\naffected by hurricane Mitch. We resolutely support the\r\nHighly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Medium-\r\nincome countries with serious external debt problems\r\nshould not be excluded from debt relief plans, as long\r\nas they implement meaningful domestic programmes to\r\neradicate poverty.\r\nIn the health sector there have been severe\r\nsetbacks in recent years in the fight against infectious\r\ndiseases, especially in Africa. Spain actively backs the\r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS) and the efforts under way to facilitate\r\naccess to drugs against AIDS for patients in developing\r\ncountries. It also supports the holding of a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on that illness.\r\nMoreover, Spain has a special interest in examining\r\npossible action against other infectious and parasitic\r\ndiseases, particularly in Africa.\r\nThe first sentence of the Charter states the resolve\r\nof the United Nations to save succeeding generations\r\n38\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nfrom the scourge of war. We must not resign ourselves\r\nto the indefinite prolongation of some regional\r\nconflicts. In Africa a solution has not yet been found\r\nfor the situation in the Congo, which for years has\r\nravaged one of the richest and most influential\r\ncountries of the continent. Angola and Sierra Leone\r\ncontinue to be the backdrop for civilian conflicts that\r\nare often financed by the illegal sale of diamonds and\r\nother precious resources.\r\nPolitical and practical support for the United\r\nNations and the mission deployed on the ground has\r\nbeen a constant feature of Spain’s policy concerning\r\nthe dispute over Western Sahara. Therefore, my\r\ncountry will maintain its commitment to a definitive\r\nsettlement of that dispute during this decisive time and\r\nwill support the efforts that the Secretary-General and\r\nhis Personal Envoy are making in compliance with\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1309 (2000).\r\nNew prospects for peace have opened up in the\r\nMiddle East following the Camp David summit. It is\r\nvital to consolidate the important progress made there\r\nand take advantage of this historic opportunity to\r\nconclude an agreement on all outstanding issues. Spain\r\nconsiders that, pursuant to the Declaration of Berlin,\r\nthe Palestinian people are entitled to establish their\r\nown state. The evolution of the peace process must be\r\nreflected in the resolutions to be adopted this year by\r\nthe General Assembly, which must not be a mechanical\r\nrepetition of the wording used in previous years.\r\nThe situation in Iraq is nevertheless proving to be\r\nfrustrating. The interruption of weapons inspections,\r\nthe absence of any foreseeable date for the lifting of\r\nthe sanctions, the continuation of armed action and the\r\ndifficult humanitarian situation in the country all\r\ncombine to produce a situation that is far from\r\nencouraging. It is imperative that consensus within the\r\nSecurity Council on this matter be strengthened and\r\nthat Iraq collaborate with the United Nations with a\r\nview to the full implementation of resolution 1284\r\n(1999) and other relevant resolutions.\r\nTurning to Latin America, it is vital that the\r\ninternational community send a clear message of\r\nsupport for the peace process in Colombia. The efforts\r\nby President Pastrana to reach an agreement that will\r\nput an end to decades of violence and lack of security\r\ndeserve the support of us all.\r\nThe difficulties faced by the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo in the\r\naccomplishment of its tasks should not overshadow its\r\nachievements to date in what is probably the\r\npeacekeeping operation with the widest-ranging\r\nobjectives ever undertaken by the United Nations.\r\nThose objectives are to pacify the territory, to reconcile\r\nits population, to rebuild its economy, and to enable\r\nKosovo, as stated in resolution 1244 (1999), to enjoy\r\nsubstantial autonomy and an administration that is truly\r\nits own, while respecting the principle of territorial\r\nsovereignty and integrity of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nMany of these conflicts could perhaps have been\r\navoided. Spain unreservedly supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to direct the Organization’s conflict-\r\nprevention. His report on Africa provides an innovative\r\napproach, proposing a wide-ranging package of\r\nmeasures to address the conflicts on the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nAn important element in this arsenal of\r\npreventive diplomatic measures is a sound sanctions\r\npolicy. Sanctions regimes must be carefully graduated\r\nin order to fulfil their goal: to penalize a particular\r\ngovernment whose policies constitute a threat to peace,\r\nwithout harming the civilian population of that country,\r\nwhich in many cases is totally powerless to influence\r\nthe decisions of its Government, or third parties.\r\nSanctions must be applied in a flexible way and be\r\nsubject to periodic review, enabling them to be adapted\r\nto changing circumstances.\r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation are another\r\ntwo essential elements of conflict prevention. It is vital\r\nto overcome the setbacks suffered in recent months by\r\nthe nuclear non-proliferation process and to promote\r\nthe signing and ratification of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test- Ban Treaty, with a view to its early entry\r\nin force. It is likewise a matter of concern that it has\r\nnot yet been possible to start negotiations on a protocol\r\non fissile material; it is urgent to achieve the necessary\r\nconsensus to that end.\r\nThe conclusion of the negotiations on the\r\nVerification Protocol to the Convention on Biological\r\nWeapons represents an achievement in this field that is\r\nas important as the entry into force of the Convention\r\non Chemical Weapons. In the same way, the 2001\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects must\r\nconstitute a milestone comparable to the Ottawa\r\nConvention banning anti-personnel mines.\r\n39\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nAnother of the United Nations goals must be to\r\nconclude the decolonization process worldwide by\r\ndoing away with the last vestiges of colonialism. One\r\nof them persists, as a painful anachronism, in Spanish\r\nterritory. I am, of course, referring to Gibraltar, where,\r\nnearly three centuries after its population was expelled\r\nand the Rock occupied by British troops, a colonial\r\nsituation still lingers. This is an infringement of my\r\ncountry’s territorial integrity and contravenes the\r\nprovisions of General Assembly resolution 2353\r\n(XXII). Regaining sovereignty over this part of our\r\nterritory is a longstanding goal for Spain, which is fully\r\nin favour of a meaningful dialogue. It is regrettable that\r\nthe United Kingdom has not yet shown a genuine\r\npolitical will to resolve this problem. Because of this,\r\n15 years after the start of bilateral talks in the\r\nframework of the Brussels process and despite the\r\ndecisions of the General Assembly, we have not\r\nregistered any progress at all on this matter, in spite of\r\nseveral concrete proposals put forward by our side.\r\nWe want a United Nations that is capable of\r\ncarrying out the tasks that have been entrusted to it. To\r\nachieve this, it must complete its process of reform.\r\nFor instance, the role of the General Assembly — the\r\nonly body in which all the Member States are\r\nrepresented — must be enhanced, as it is the United\r\nNations driving force for debate and political impetus.\r\nCivil society should be incorporated to a greater extent\r\ninto the Organization’s work. This would contribute to\r\nbringing people closer to the United Nations and to\r\nsecuring a greater commitment from them with regard\r\nto its work.\r\nIt is also vital to reform the Security Council in\r\norder to enable it to fully perform its duties in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\r\nSpanish Government believes that this reform must\r\ndraw its inspiration from the following principles.\r\nFirst, it must be conducted on the basis of a broad\r\nand solid consensus, in order to avoid dangerous\r\ndivisions among Member States and to provide the\r\nenlarged Council with the greater legitimacy it needs to\r\ncarry out its work effectively.\r\nIn the context of democratization, it must allow\r\nfor an increase in the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers from all regional groups, and especially from\r\nthe developing world. Spain considers that an\r\nenlargement of this category of non-permanent\r\nmembers would best reflect the trend towards the\r\ndemocratization of international society at the dawn of\r\nthe third millennium.\r\nTo enhance the Council’s effectiveness, steps\r\nmust be taken to prevent exercise of the veto power\r\nfrom blocking the Council in certain crisis situations.\r\nFinally, there must be greater transparency. The\r\nCouncil’s working methods must be improved by\r\nincreasing the number and quality of the consultations\r\namong its members and with other Member States, so\r\nthat the latter will not be left out of the decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nThe Organization that we need must also be able\r\nto act firmly and effectively on the ground in order to\r\nmaintain the peace. The first step in this direction is to\r\nreflect on past mistakes. Therein lies the importance of\r\nthe Brahimi report on United Nations peace operations,\r\nwhich — in the same way as former reports on Rwanda\r\nand Srebrenica — hit a nerve when it acknowledged\r\nour faults and proposed solutions for overcoming them.\r\nThe Organization’s shortcomings in this field\r\nhave at times been very serious, and have cost human\r\nlives and brought great suffering to the peoples directly\r\naffected. They have also seriously discredited the\r\nUnited Nations in the eyes of our peoples.\r\nSpain has a direct interest in ensuring that\r\npeacekeeping operations are well organized and\r\nmanaged, because at this time hundreds of Spaniards\r\nare participating in them in such faraway places as East\r\nTimor, Kosovo, Ethiopia and Guatemala. Moreover,\r\nlast year Spain signed an agreement with the\r\nSecretariat on the Stand-by Forces — an agreement in\r\nwhich some of the recommendations contained in the\r\nBrahimi report already appear.\r\nSpain steadfastly supports these recommendations\r\nand hopes that they will be rapidly implemented. At the\r\nsame time, we must be aware that all of this will\r\nrequire a much greater political and financial\r\ncommitment on the part of all with respect to\r\npeacekeeping operations. It will require faster\r\ndeployment of the necessary military and civilian units\r\nand larger-scale measures in order to consolidate peace\r\nonce conflicts come to an end. Above all, if United\r\nNations troops are compelled to take greater risks in\r\norder to guarantee the implementation of Security\r\nCouncil mandates, such mandates must be clear,\r\nrealistic and have the unequivocal backing of the\r\nCouncil. All this will require a serious effort to find\r\n40\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\ncommon positions and to achieve consensus within the\r\nCouncil in the elaboration of the resolutions containing\r\nsuch mandates, eliminating any ambiguities that could\r\nhamper their effective application. It means more\r\nresolute and unwavering action against specific States\r\nor groups which may attempt to disrupt such action,\r\nincluding the possible application of sanctions. Only\r\nthen will we be able to send our troops to situations in\r\nwhich they will have to risk their lives in order to\r\nensure that such mandates are upheld.\r\nImproving peacekeeping operations will\r\nundoubtedly be costly. Neither this nor any of the other\r\ntasks facing the Organization will be possible if it does\r\nnot resolve its financial crisis. Spain is the eighth-\r\nlargest contributor to its regular budget and pays its\r\ncontributions on time, in full and without conditions.\r\nTherefore we have a direct interest in seeing the\r\nOrganization’s financial crisis resolved once and for\r\nall, as soon as possible. The principle of capacity to\r\npay must continue to be the basic criterion for deciding\r\nthe assessed contributions. European Union countries\r\nalready are contributing much more than they should to\r\nthe United Nations budget in accordance with this\r\nprinciple. Spain’s stance will be a constructive one in\r\nthe negotiations to review the scale of assessments later\r\nthis fall.\r\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, there is\r\nno alternative to multilateral cooperation. The United\r\nNations must rise to the occasion in order to fulfil the\r\nexpectations of the peoples who founded it. The\r\ncountries represented here must face up to that\r\nresponsibility by building an Organization capable of\r\nmeeting the challenges posed by globalization in the\r\nnew millennium. The United Nations that we want is\r\npossible. It is within our reach to achieve it.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I call\r\nnext on Her Excellency Mrs. Camara Hadja Mahawa\r\nBangoura, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Guinea.\r\nMrs. Bangoura (Guinea) (spoke in French): I am\r\nvery pleased on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Guinea to convey to Mr. Harri Holkeri\r\nof Finland our warmest congratulations on his\r\nunanimous election to preside over our deliberations at\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His\r\nelection highlighted his merits, his personal qualities\r\nand his rich experience in international affairs. It also\r\nreflected the high esteem in which the international\r\ncommunity holds his great country, Finland, whose\r\ncommitment to the ideals of peace, justice, progress\r\nand the advancement of women is well known and\r\nappreciated by one and all. As a member of the General\r\nCommittee at this session, my delegation wishes to\r\nassure the President of its support and full cooperation.\r\nIt gives me pleasure also to pay tribute to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, who\r\nhonourably carried out his weighty responsibilities in\r\nthe service of the Organization.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose exemplary work at the helm of\r\nthe Organization merits our highest appreciation and\r\nour support. I take this opportunity moreover to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his report (A/54/2000)\r\nentitled “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations\r\nin the twenty-first century”. That remarkable document\r\ntakes account of all the current concerns of Member\r\nStates.\r\nI welcome the admission of the State of Tuvalu as\r\nthe one hundred eighty-ninth Member of the\r\nOrganization. This reinforces the universality of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is a historic\r\none. It is taking place just as the Organization has\r\nsuccessfully concluded the Millennium Summit, which\r\nbrought together in this Hall nearly all the world’s\r\nleaders. The outcome of that important Summit is a\r\nsource of hope for our peoples at the dawn of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nJust one week ago, from this very rostrum, the\r\nPrime Minister of Guinea informed the international\r\ncommunity of a barbarous act of aggression against the\r\nRepublic of Guinea, an act of aggression whose sole\r\naim was to destabilize my country. Deadly, devastating\r\nattacks have been carried out against the peaceful\r\npopulation of Guinea. These were led by armed gangs\r\nfrom Liberia, but it is regrettable to have to note that\r\nanother fraternal African country, Burkina Faso, has\r\nalso been involved in the aggression. The Republic of\r\nGuinea, a land of peace and hospitality, which has paid\r\nan enormous price by receiving hundreds of thousands\r\nof refugees and which is working for the restoration of\r\npeace and harmony in West Africa, has thus been the\r\nvictim of aggression by the same people who caused\r\nthe genocide and mutilations in Liberia and in Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\n41\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nI urgently call on the international community\r\nstrongly to condemn this aggression, which is part of a\r\nplan to destabilize the subregion. It is this that justifies\r\nmy Government’s request to the Security Council that\r\nvigorous measures be taken to guarantee peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in the West African region.\r\nThe Government of Guinea has had to face the\r\nsevere consequences of the massive presence of\r\n800,000 on its territory for the past decade, and it has\r\nbeen obliged to divert resources from our country’s\r\neconomic development programmes. That is why my\r\nGovernment is most grateful for the United Nations\r\ninitiative to convene a conference for support and\r\nsolidarity with respect to Guinea. On behalf of my\r\nGovernment, I wish once again to convey my\r\ndelegation’s sincere thanks to the Secretary-General\r\nand to all others who have contributed to this important\r\ninitiative. My country looks forward with great interest\r\nto the completion of this initiative with the convening\r\nof a second meeting, scheduled to be held in November\r\nat Geneva.\r\nThis is the proper moment for my delegation to\r\nturn to the thorny question of conflict in Africa.\r\nIndeed, many of the crises that have emerged on our\r\ncontinent pose a threat to peace and constitute a grave\r\nviolation of the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations. The scope of these crises and their proliferation\r\njeopardizes all efforts at national development and at\r\nachieving subregional integration. I take this opportunity to\r\nwelcome the report (A/55/305) of the Panel on United\r\nNations Peace Operations, chaired by Mr. Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi. Its recommendations enabled the Security\r\nCouncil to adopt an important resolution on ensuring an\r\neffective role for the Council in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, particularly in Africa. My\r\ndelegation hopes that the new provisions of that resolution\r\nwill be used to guarantee the effectiveness of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations.\r\nAmong the central priorities of Africa, which\r\nremains the theatre of many conflicts, is the\r\nstrengthening of its capacity to prevent, manage and\r\nresolve conflicts. Thus, whether it be the conflict\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea or the situation in the\r\nGreat Lakes region, in Angola or in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, there have been significant\r\nbreakthroughs in the pursuit of peaceful, just and\r\nlasting solutions, thanks to concerted action by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn the West African region, the quest for peace in\r\nSierra Leone is continuing with the commendable\r\nassistance of States members of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and\r\nwith the active support of the United Nations, through\r\nthe deployment of the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone (UNAMSIL). My delegation expresses its full\r\nsupport for Security Council resolution 1306 (2000),\r\nwhich placed an embargo on the illegal sale of\r\ndiamonds from conflict zones. We appeal urgently to\r\nall States and to all specialized agencies to cooperate\r\nactively in the effective implementation of that\r\nresolution.\r\nThe proliferation and uncontrolled distribution of\r\nlight weapons is another subject of grave concern, and\r\nis a major factor complicating and prolonging conflicts\r\nin Africa and, more tragically, encouraging the\r\nrecruitment of child soldiers. Indeed, the resurgence of\r\nrebel movements and the expansion of large-scale\r\nbanditry in our countries have been made possible by\r\nthat phenomenon. The firm support of the international\r\ncommunity is required to eradicate it. In that\r\nconnection, my delegation is pleased at the initiatives\r\ntaken by the United Nations and by the OAU to support\r\nthe efforts of our States to combat this scourge, which\r\nthreatens the stability of our continent.\r\nThe beginning of the third millennium brings\r\nmany challenges and hopes. It brings the hope of\r\nseeing a plan for the settlement to the conflict in\r\nWestern Sahara, thanks to the joint efforts of the OAU\r\nand the United Nations, and the hope of finally seeing\r\nIsrael and its Arab neighbours give peace a chance\r\nthrough a just and lasting settlement to the crisis,\r\ntaking into account the legitimate aspirations of the\r\nPalestinian people, as well as the respect for the rights\r\nand dignity of all peoples in the region.\r\nThe question of development remains one of the\r\nmajor challenges of this century, and as such it must\r\nremain at the centre of our Organization’s concerns.\r\nAt a time when a portion of the planet has\r\ncontentedly crossed the threshold of this new\r\nmillennium and is embarking, under the rubric of\r\nglobalization, on what is called “the new economy”, a\r\nmajor portion of the world — indeed, the largest\r\nportion — continues to live in poverty, suffering the\r\nperverse effects of this globalization.\r\nWith regard to the alarming situation prevailing\r\non the African continent, the main concern of the\r\n42\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\npeoples of the United Nations must be Africa, so that\r\nthe root causes of its non-development can be\r\neradicated and so that it can be enabled to eliminate\r\npoverty and enhance its capacities in order for it to\r\nhave better access to markets. To do that, debt\r\ncancellation, an increase in official development\r\nassistance and better attention to its specific needs\r\nshould make it possible to integrate the African\r\ncontinent into the world economy. That is why my\r\ndelegation, based on the correlation between peace and\r\ndevelopment, is pleased at the recent decisions taken\r\nby the G-8 in Okinawa, aimed at more effectively\r\ncombating poverty and at bridging the digital gap\r\nbetween the North and the South and at humanizing\r\nglobalization.\r\nIn that respect, my country calls for more\r\nsolidarity on the part of the rich countries, and we\r\ndeeply hope that — over and above professions of\r\ngood faith — concrete measures will be taken to allow\r\nthe developing countries, particularly those in Africa,\r\nto experience sustained growth leading to sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWith that in mind, my delegation appeals to all its\r\ndevelopment partners to contribute, by means of more\r\ngenerous and better-targeted aid, to strengthening the\r\ninstitutional capacities of our States and to creating\r\nadequate infrastructures, which guarantee balanced\r\ndevelopment and success in the struggle against\r\npoverty.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea is very much concerned\r\nby the ravages of the AIDS virus. We believe that this\r\nbattle must further mobilize the international\r\ncommunity so that the necessary sacrifices can be made\r\nto halt this scourge, which has taken more victims in\r\nAfrica than anywhere else in the world. That is why my\r\ndelegation supports the important decisions that\r\nresulted from the recent International Conference held\r\nin Durban, South Africa.\r\nThe protection of fundamental human rights, the\r\nsatisfaction of priority human needs and social justice\r\nmust remain at the forefront of United Nations\r\nconcerns. The United Nations, in its irreplaceable role\r\nas an instrument for the promotion of cooperation and\r\nunderstanding between peoples, must strengthen the\r\nculture of peace and sharing.\r\nToday it is unanimously acknowledged that the\r\nUnited Nations can continue to play an effective role\r\nonly if there is a necessary reform of its organs, in\r\nparticular the Security Council, which has the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The aspirations of strengthening its\r\nauthority and ensuring more equitable representation in\r\nthe Council for the Organization’s Members have been\r\nreiterated many times by the overwhelming majority of\r\nUnited Nations Members, and recently by virtually all\r\nof the heads of State or Government during the\r\nMillennium Summit. We must also restore to the\r\nGeneral Assembly its central role as the main\r\ndeliberative body and, finally, reform the other organs,\r\nwith a view to a greater revitalization of the entire\r\nUnited Nations system. These are the aspirations of the\r\npeoples of the United Nations — to enable this\r\nOrganization to face the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nIn his statement at the Millennium Summit, the\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Guinea reiterated the\r\ntotal commitment of our country to the principles of\r\nthe United Nations and to the Charter. In this\r\nAssembly, I would like to reaffirm this commitment,\r\nwhich has never been found wanting in the history of\r\nmy country. Under the leadership of its President,\r\nGeneral Lansana Conté, a man of peace and dialogue,\r\nGuinea has always struggled to uplift human dignity, to\r\ndefend freedom, to restore peace and to cultivate\r\nharmony among peoples.\r\nGuinea will continue, side by side with other\r\nMember States of our Organization, to work resolutely\r\nto free humankind from the spectre of war, violence,\r\nexclusion and intolerance, and for a world of peace,\r\njustice and solidarity for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I shall\r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements made in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Eldon (United Kingdom): I can assure you,\r\nMr. President, that I will speak for far less than 10\r\nminutes.\r\nI would like to respond briefly to the remarks\r\nmade by the Foreign Minister of Spain this afternoon\r\nabout Gibraltar. The long-standing position of the\r\nBritish Government on this matter is well known to the\r\n43\r\nA/55/PV.15\r\nGovernment of Spain. I will simply restate it briefly\r\nhere.\r\nBritish sovereignty over Gibraltar was clearly\r\nestablished in the Treaty of Utrecht. This legal fact is\r\nincontrovertible. Moreover, the British Government\r\nstands by the commitment to the people of Gibraltar, as\r\ncontained in the preamble to the 1969 Constitution of\r\nGibraltar, which states that Her Majesty’s Government\r\nwill never enter into arrangements under which the\r\npeople of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty\r\nof another State against their freely and democratically\r\nexpressed wishes.\r\nThe British Government believes that issues\r\nrelating to Gibraltar can be resolved only by building\r\ntrust, cooperation and dialogue, and through direct\r\ntalks aimed at overcoming differences, such as those\r\nestablished under the 1984 Brussels declaration.\r\nWe attach continuing importance to our dialogue\r\nwith Spain.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nMy delegation has just listened with a great deal of\r\ninterest to the statement made by Mrs. Bangoura,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Guinea.\r\nWith regard to the unfounded accusation that has\r\njust been made against my country, Burkina Faso, I\r\ndeem it essential to recall here and now the comments\r\nmade by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBurkina Faso yesterday, when he referred here to the\r\nunfortunate situation in Guinea. The Minister stated\r\nthat\r\n“in the face of the recent surprising, to put it\r\nmildly, allegations by Guinea, we would like to\r\nreassure that beloved, fraternal country, as well as\r\nthe international community, that Burkina Faso\r\nhad no part, directly or indirectly, in those\r\nunfortunate events. We repeat our readiness to\r\nwelcome or support any initiative that could shed\r\nlight on this matter, which we find profoundly\r\ndistressing”. (A/55/PV.13)\r\nThat assurance was not able to ease the minds and\r\nhearts of some people. We became aware of this earlier\r\nwhen we heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Guinea speaking.\r\nLet me state here once again that these renewed\r\naccusations are unfounded. On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I reiterate our readiness to work towards\r\nfinding the truth of this matter.\r\nMr. Fall (Guinea) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation followed with great interest the statement\r\nmade in right of reply by the representative of\r\nbrotherly Burkina Faso. We are pleased by the spirit of\r\nfraternity demonstrated by the delegation of Burkina\r\nFaso.\r\nMy delegation would like once again to\r\nreiterate — as was done first from this rostrum by our\r\nPrime Minister and earlier today by our Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation — the willingness of\r\nGuinea to maintain and develop its relations with all\r\nAfrican countries. In the history of Africa since 1958,\r\nwe have never contributed to the destabilization of any\r\ncountry. On the contrary, we have always paid a price\r\nfor the liberation and the consolidation of the\r\nindependence of African countries.\r\nOur words today are not mere assertions; they are\r\nbased on concrete information in our possession\r\nconcerning recent events in Guinea. Everyone will\r\nrecall that this is not the first time this issue has been\r\nraised. These connections were stressed during the\r\nmost difficult moments of the war in Liberia and again\r\nduring the current conflict in Sierra Leone, which has\r\nclaimed so many victims. Once again, as to the painful\r\nevents in our country, we have sad proof that Burkina\r\nFaso was involved.\r\nAt any rate, my delegation wishes to reiterate to\r\nmy brother from Burkina Faso that Guinea remains\r\nwilling to maintain the most cordial and friendly\r\nrelations with his country, so long as respect is\r\nmaintained for the territorial integrity of our country.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.15 p.m.\r\n"
