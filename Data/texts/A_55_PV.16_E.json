(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I first give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Sir John Kaputin, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea.\r\nSir John Kaputin (Papua New Guinea): On\r\nbehalf of the people and Government of Papua New\r\nGuinea, I join previous speakers in congratulating you,\r\nSir, on your election to your prestigious post. Your\r\nunanimous election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at the dawn of the new millennium shows\r\nthe high esteem in which the international community\r\nholds both you personally and your country, Finland.\r\nWe are confident that you will guide the historic fifty-\r\nfifth session to a successful conclusion.\r\nThe skill with which your predecessor, Mr. Theo-\r\nBen Gurirab of Namibia, cooperated to develop the\r\ntheme of the recent Millennium Summit, and presided\r\nover the drafting of the outcome document and ensured\r\nthe smooth management of the Summit earned our\r\nsincere appreciation for a job very well done. We also\r\ncongratulate him on his very positive contribution to\r\nour collective deliberations during the previous year.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity, through you, Sir,\r\nto heartily congratulate the heads of State of both\r\nFinland and Namibia on their magnanimous\r\nstewardship and successful conclusion of the recent\r\nunprecedented large assembly of approximately 150\r\nheads of State and Government in New York, which\r\npaved the way for the pursuit of our common vision\r\nand security into the twenty-first century.\r\nBeyond the millennium celebrations, this is a\r\ntime for reflection and looking ahead. The Millennium\r\nSummit took place on the eve of the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of Papua New Guinea’s independence. The\r\nsame anniversary also marks the first quarter century of\r\nmy country’s membership of the United Nations. It is\r\ntherefore an apt occasion both for reflecting on\r\nexperience and for looking ahead.\r\nMy particular focus is on the changing character\r\nof, need for and potential for international cooperation.\r\nThe conjunction of the millennium with Papua New\r\nGuinea’s silver anniversary invites us to take a number\r\nof different time perspectives: the short, medium and\r\nlong terms. For those of us who have been privileged to\r\nplay an active part in public life during this period, it\r\nalso provides the opportunity to compare the ambitions\r\nwe had 25 years ago with the challenges we face now.\r\nAs the Secretary-General recently reminded us in\r\nthe very title of the document (A/54/2000) he prepared\r\nto guide and stimulate the Millennium Summit, the\r\nUnited Nations was formed in the name and with the\r\nobjective of furthering the common purposes of “We\r\nthe peoples of the United Nations”. In similar fashion,\r\nthe Constitution that came into effect when my country\r\nbecame independent was made and adopted in the\r\nname of “We the people of Papua New Guinea”.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nAs someone who had the honour of participating\r\nin making the Papua New Guinea Constitution, I am\r\nvery mindful of the national goals and directive\r\nprinciples we set for ourselves at independence. While\r\nsome have a distinctively national character — such as\r\npreserving, developing and building on Papua New\r\nGuinean ways — others resemble challenges that the\r\nUnited Nations faces today. They include such\r\nuniversal challenges as promoting integral human\r\ndevelopment, equity and participation, and sustainable\r\nuse of natural resources and the environment. They\r\nalso include the challenge of maintaining,\r\nstrengthening and making mutually beneficial use of\r\nnational sovereignty and self-reliance.\r\nBut look at us now. What have we achieved?\r\nWhat remains to be done? The most striking feature of\r\ncontemporary Papua New Guinea is the way in which\r\nwe have had to trim our objectives. Our situation is,\r\nobviously, not unique, but it certainly warrants the\r\nmost careful consideration.\r\nWhen the present Government, led by the Prime\r\nMinister, The Honourable Sir Mekere Morauta, came to\r\noffice in the middle of last year, we set ourselves five\r\nvery carefully defined objectives: to restore integrity to\r\nState institutions; to stabilize our national currency —\r\nthe kina — and the national budget; to remove\r\nobstacles to investment and growth; and to continue the\r\nprocess of working for lasting peace in Bougainville by\r\npeaceful means.\r\nThe national goals and directive principles\r\ncontinue to guide our long-term ambitions and plans.\r\nBut experience and the realities of governance in the\r\nage of globalization have required us to focus on much\r\nmore specific, short- and medium-term objectives. We\r\ncannot blame others — or even such largely impersonal\r\nprocesses as economic and technological\r\nglobalization — for every aspect of our current\r\nsituation. Much of the responsibility lies with leaders\r\nand institutions at home. Both fortunately and\r\nunfortunately, it is part of the human condition at the\r\nstart of the twenty-first century that we are not on our\r\nown. Despite important differences in origins,\r\nprocesses and outcomes, our situation is not unique.\r\nMany other developing countries face similar\r\nchallenges in the short and medium terms.\r\nInternational cooperation is an important key to\r\ncollective self-help, both between countries with\r\nsimilar weaknesses and strengths, and between\r\ncountries that are different and complementary —\r\nespecially rich and poor.\r\nAs regards global cooperation, as a member of\r\nthe global community Papua New Guinea is able to\r\ndraw on support from the World Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, our\r\ndevelopment cooperation partners in Europe, and the\r\nAsia-Pacific countries that have formed themselves\r\ninto the Friends of Papua New Guinea.\r\nWhile my delegation has come to New York to\r\ndiscuss global issues and explore the potential for\r\nglobal cooperation, Papua New Guinea also\r\nparticipates in various forms of regional, interregional\r\nand bilateral cooperation. Papua New Guinea\r\nrecognizes the value of, and is firmly committed to\r\nfurther strengthening, global cooperation through\r\nbodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO).\r\nMy Government is disappointed that the next\r\nround of World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nnegotiations has been delayed, and calls for them to be\r\nheld at the earliest possible opportunity.\r\nAs one of the countries where increasing areas of\r\nland are already becoming unusable or actually\r\ndisappearing as a result of rising sea-levels caused by\r\nclimate change, we believe in the urgent need for full\r\nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nOn an issue where the very survival of certain\r\nmembers of the global community is clearly at stake —\r\nand where global security depends on coordinated\r\nglobal action — there must be no backsliding, no\r\ncompromises, and no special cases allowed because of\r\ninability or unwillingness to honour global agreements\r\nfor whatever reason.\r\nPapua New Guinea is pleased to welcome our\r\nclose island neighbours and very good friends from\r\nTuvalu to membership of the United Nations.\r\nWhat a terrible tragedy it would be if the\r\ninternational community were to fail them at the very\r\ntime when they, together with other small island\r\nStates — including countries which joined the United\r\nNations last year — are assuming the responsibilities\r\nwhich go with becoming full participants in the\r\nOrganization’s affairs.\r\nCertain security issues, such as climate change,\r\nrequire a global approach. So do efforts to limit the\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nproliferation that would bring about the complete\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nGlobal cooperation is the only means by which\r\nthe international community can realistically hope to\r\nachieve the objective which the Secretary-General set\r\nfor the Millennium Summit of ensuring that\r\nglobalization becomes a positive force for people,\r\ninstead of leaving them behind in squalor, especially in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nHowever, as the Secretary-General also suggested\r\nin his report (A/54/1) to the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, different regions have different\r\nproblems. Even similar problems in different settings\r\nmay require different approaches. Security policies that\r\nwork in one region may not work in others. The road to\r\nsuccess can require complementary national, regional\r\nand global efforts.\r\nThus, Papua New Guinea is addressing the\r\nunwelcome spread of small arms and light weapons by\r\nimposing a complete ban on the issuance of new gun\r\nlicenses. We support efforts to deal with the spread of\r\nillegally obtained or held arms through the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum.\r\nWe look to the forthcoming United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects to provide a global\r\nframework and global support for the efforts that\r\nindividual States and regional organizations are taking\r\nto deal with the problem within their respective\r\njurisdictions.\r\nWhen it comes to the management of ocean\r\nresources, Papua New Guinea sees regional and\r\ninterregional cooperation as complementary to\r\nmeasures designed to ensure the sustainable harvesting\r\nof fish in national waters.\r\nWe therefore welcome the agreement recently\r\nconcluded under the auspices of the Multilateral High-\r\nlevel Conference on fisheries with the purpose of\r\nensuring sustainable fishing for tuna and highly\r\nmigratory species throughout their ranges in the\r\nWestern and Central Pacific.\r\nPapua New Guinea would also like to see both\r\nbroader and deeper cooperation between coastal States\r\nin other aspects of oceans and ocean-bed management,\r\nincluding deep-sea mining.\r\nIn terms of regional cooperation, such\r\ncooperation is indispensable to dealing successfully\r\nwith many important global and national issues. But\r\nregional cooperation can itself have a variety of\r\ndifferent dimensions and employ different means.\r\nIn the South Pacific, for example, two of our\r\nclosest neighbours, Fiji and Solomon Islands, are\r\nexperiencing internal difficulties that have given rise to\r\nserious concern on the part of their friends.\r\nWe do not condone the illegal overthrow of\r\ndemocratic and constitutional Governments or other\r\nthreats to the security of the Governments and citizens\r\nof other States, but, regrettably, and despite repeated\r\nefforts by previous Papua New Guinea Governments\r\nand other States, the main intra-regional body engaged\r\nin promoting regional cooperation in the South Pacific,\r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum, does not have a mechanism\r\nfor dealing promptly and effectively with challenges to\r\nthe security of States in the region.\r\nIt has, therefore, been unable to arrange\r\nconsultations, let alone facilitate a coordinated\r\napproach  to the situations which have arisen following\r\narmed challenges to the Governments of Fiji and\r\nSolomon Islands. Some of our neighbours have\r\nresponded by looking for support outside the region.\r\nWith the recent addition of six additional Pacific\r\nmembers to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)\r\ngroup of States party to the Lome Convention, 14\r\nPacific island States now have access to a very\r\npractical mechanism for dealing with such situations.\r\nThe upshot is that, when Ministers and\r\nAmbassadors from Pacific ACP member States met in\r\nCotonou, Benin, in June for the signing of the new\r\nframework agreement between the ACP and the\r\nEuropean Union, we decided to set up a ministerial\r\nmission to report on the situations in Fiji and Solomon\r\nIslands.\r\nIn doing so, we were mindful of the need for, and\r\ngrateful for the support of, the European Union.\r\nThe offer made by the French Minister for\r\nEconomic Cooperation at the regional forum of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to\r\nensure that the European Commission would defer\r\nmaking a final decision on sanctions until the Pacific\r\nACP Ministerial Mission had reported was especially\r\nwelcome because of the meaning and support it gave to\r\nour effort at regional cooperation.\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nThe imposition of sanctions against a country can\r\nbe a very blunt instrument indeed, causing innocent\r\nand powerless people to suffer at the same time as the\r\npowerful and influential, and sometimes\r\ndisadvantaging them even more. Even so-called smart\r\nsanctions can have wide, unintended effects while\r\nleaving their objects largely unaffected.\r\nWhen a small group of armed men try to take\r\nover a Government, imposing sanctions that affect\r\ninnocent men, women and children can be not only\r\nineffective but even counter-productive.\r\nSanctions might leave armed youths unaffected\r\nand in a position where they are even unable to\r\nappreciate, or are indifferent to, the wider\r\nconsequences of their actions.\r\nThe underlying causes of inter-group tensions in\r\nSolomon Islands and the events which followed the\r\nattempted civilian armed coup in Fiji could be difficult\r\nto identify, and are beyond influence by sanctions.\r\nIt is, therefore, vital that serious difficulties such\r\nas those currently affecting Fiji and Solomon Islands\r\nbe properly studied and carefully addressed.\r\nSometimes, the people best equipped to\r\nunderstand such situations and identify underlying\r\ncauses are neighbours with similar cultures or other\r\nshared values.\r\nIn terms of the ACP Ministerial Mission, at the\r\nrequest of other Pacific ACP States, I have recently had\r\nthe honour of leading the Pacific ACP Ministerial\r\nMission to Fiji and Solomon Islands.\r\nMy colleagues included the Ministers for Foreign\r\nAffairs from Cook Islands, Mr. Robert Woonton, and\r\nVanuatu, the Honourable Serge Vohor, as well as the\r\nMinister for Education from Samoa, the Honourable\r\nFiame Naomi Mata’afa.\r\nWith the active support of the Governments of\r\nboth countries, we followed a crowded itinerary of\r\nmeetings with the Prime Ministers, ministers and\r\nofficials in Fiji and Solomon Islands, members of the\r\nprevious Governments of both countries and business\r\nand trade union leaders, as well as a wide cross-section\r\nof other elements of civil society, including women’s\r\norganizations. We were also able to interview victims\r\nin towns and rural areas, and to examine instances of\r\ndestruction at first hand.\r\nMy colleagues and I are currently working on our\r\nreport. We expect to present it to the European\r\nCommission, the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and other\r\nACP, EU and joint bodies in October.\r\nThe commitment made by the French Minister for\r\nEconomic Cooperation, whose country currently holds\r\nthe presidency of the EU, means that the region — or,\r\nat least, our report — has been given the opportunity to\r\ninfluence events. The process on which we have\r\nembarked is, therefore, more meaningful than any\r\nexisting alternative. We, the Pacific ACP members,\r\noffered to share our report with the Pacific Islands\r\nForum, and the support our initiative has received from\r\nthe region reflects our commitment to wider\r\ncooperation, not to mention our unwillingness to\r\nbecome involved in even the appearance of\r\ncompetition between rival regional bodies or groups.\r\nThe initiative has been welcomed and praised,\r\nboth in the region and further afield. It sets an example\r\nwhich is worthy of close study both for the precedents\r\nit sets for cooperation among Pacific ACP States and as\r\na possible model for similar efforts in other regions.\r\nWith regard to the Bougainville situation, Fiji and\r\nSolomon Islands are not the first States in our region to\r\nexperience serious internal difficulties, though we pray\r\nnot only that there will be real improvement very soon\r\nbut that they will be the last States to experience such\r\ndifficulties.\r\nAfter more than eight years of armed conflict —\r\nfrom 1989 to 1997 — the part of Papua New Guinea\r\nknown as Bougainville is now at peace. The\r\nprogressive political settlement is moving ahead. The\r\nLincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and\r\nDevelopment on Bougainville commits the parties to\r\npeace-building on several levels, from weapons\r\ndisposal and the re-establishment of civil authority,\r\nthrough reconciliation among former combatants to\r\nreconstruction of infrastructure, restoration of services,\r\neconomic and social recovery and early resumption of\r\nthe kinds of development which are part of the return\r\nof normalcy.\r\nThe national Government is committed to such a\r\nmultidimensional approach. It is the way by which we\r\nhope to cooperate in building for a lasting peace by\r\npeaceful means. The priority which the Prime Minister\r\ngave the Bougainville peace process more than 12\r\nmonths ago remains in place. Evidence of its\r\ncontinuing significance can be seen in the initiative he\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nhas recently taken to meet key Bougainvillean demands\r\nwithin the framework of the Papua New Guinea\r\nConstitution.\r\nThe Government, which took the initiative in\r\ninviting our neighbours, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand\r\nand Vanuatu, to set up the neutral, regional Peace\r\nMonitoring Group (PMG), values the contribution its\r\nunarmed personnel make to promoting mutual\r\nconfidence on the ground. The PMG’s success can be\r\njudged from the peaceful way in which it is now\r\nbeginning to disengage by substantially reducing its\r\nsize. The process needs greater support from the\r\nBougainvillean parties so as to avoid the vacuum which\r\nhas followed the departure of similar peacekeeping\r\noperations elsewhere, by cooperating in the re-\r\nestablishment of policing, courts and correctional\r\ninstitutional services, as well as by strengthening the\r\ninstitutions at community level that help to maintain\r\npublic order, dispense justice and uphold the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nAs the initiator of the request for the United\r\nNations observer mission in Bougainville, and as its\r\nhost, Papua New Guinea appreciates the support which\r\nthe Security Council and other organs of the United\r\nNations provide for the Bougainville peace process. We\r\nare determined to keep on working for lasting peace by\r\npeaceful means within a flexible framework which will\r\nallow Bougainville a high degree of autonomy\r\nconsistent with the integrity, security and sovereignty\r\nof the nation.\r\nWith regard to social and economic issues, as a\r\ndeveloping country with 25 years of independence,\r\nPapua New Guinea is experiencing very great difficulty\r\nin improving national performance as measured by\r\nhuman development indicators. In some areas, our\r\nrecord is actually becoming worse. The current\r\nGovernment’s five main objectives are intended to\r\nfocus attention and effort where they are most needed.\r\nOur determination to pursue them is already making a\r\nvery real difference, especially as far as economic\r\nmanagement and the delivery of Government services\r\nare concerned.\r\nStructural adjustment, including quite\r\nfundamental public sector reform, is one of the key\r\nmeans of bringing about often long-overdue change.\r\nWe need the continuing support of our economic\r\npartners to succeed, including access to markets;\r\nincreased investment in priority areas, such as\r\ndownstream processing, which provides increased\r\nopportunities for productive employment; and aid on\r\nconcessional terms. The recently concluded partnership\r\nagreement between the ACP countries and the EU is an\r\nexample worthy of much wider emulation.\r\nAs a developing country that achieved\r\nindependence only a quarter of a century ago, Papua\r\nNew Guinea is firmly committed to the proper\r\npreparation for orderly decolonization. Impressed with\r\nthe progress being made to implement the Noumea\r\nAccord, we continue to believe very strongly that the\r\nrights of the indigenous Kanaks of New Caledonia\r\nmust be respected. Conscious of the consequences of\r\nother forms of decolonization, we welcome the re-\r\nemergence of East Timor as an independent entity. We\r\nlook forward to receiving a delegation later this year to\r\ndiscuss how we might develop technical and other\r\nforms of mutually beneficial South-South cooperation.\r\nMeanwhile, even as we continue to deepen and\r\nbroaden cooperation with other Pacific island\r\ncountries, we respect the integrity of our other\r\nneighbours and continue to benefit from the exchanges\r\nwhich flow from our status as a special observer at\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nmeetings. In the broader arena of Asia-Pacific\r\ncooperation, we value our membership of the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum and\r\ncontinue to work towards honouring the reciprocal\r\ncommitments APEC members have made to liberalize\r\nmarkets. APEC includes some of our closest bilateral\r\npartners and friends. Common membership, and the\r\nprocess of developing economic ties with other APEC\r\neconomies, do not detract from other aspects of Papua\r\nNew Guinea’s foreign relations. They do not affect the\r\ncommitments we have made to such good friends as the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China. We will not allow them to\r\ndo so.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to say that, 25 years\r\nafter independence, Papua New Guinea has one of the\r\nlongest unbroken records of constitutional and\r\ndemocratic government among countries that have\r\nbecome independent in the last 50 or so years. We have\r\nexperienced difficulties, and had some near misses.\r\nThe stresses and strains which have affected our system\r\nof Government have tested our strengths. In doing so,\r\nthey have increased our understanding of countries\r\nexperiencing serious internal difficulties — although\r\nnot our sympathy for those who deliberately violate\r\ndemocratic principles or established constitutional\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\npractices — while reinforcing our commitment to good\r\ngovernance, both at home and abroad.\r\nApart from the obvious consequences that this\r\ncommitment has for Papua New Guinea’s response to\r\ncountries experiencing serious internal difficulties,\r\nincluding our preference for a positive, forward-\r\nlooking approach and not negative sanctions, it also\r\nunderlies our support for United Nations reform.\r\nThe reform must extend from improving\r\nadministrative performance to making the Security\r\nCouncil more representative of United Nations\r\nMembers as a whole. It must, in fact, extend to the\r\nperformance of United Nations Members themselves,\r\nespecially when it comes to paying their dues in a\r\ntimely way and in full.\r\nThe millennium marks an important turning point\r\nin the calendar, and, because of my country’s silver\r\nanniversary, in Papua New Guinea’s history too. The\r\nUnited Nations is also at a critical turning point, with\r\nthe Secretary-General drawing members’ attention\r\nback to the original basis and focus among the people\r\nthe Organization should serve.\r\nThe recent review of United Nations peace and\r\nsecurity activities has produced an excellent report\r\nwhich challenges us to turn another corner and ensure\r\nthat the increased responsibilities which the\r\nOrganization has assumed since the end of the cold war\r\nhelp to keep and build peace in very different\r\nconditions.\r\nI conclude by paying tribute to the vision which\r\nparticipants in the Millennium Summit have expressed\r\non our behalf. In doing so, let me add that the real\r\nchallenge we face is, emphatically, not to make more\r\nspeeches, but to turn their wise words into practical\r\nforms of cooperation which help us achieve common\r\npurposes without sacrificing the diversity which is the\r\nbasis of our need and ability to engage in global self-\r\nhelp.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nDatuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Syed Hamid (Malaysia): I join other\r\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession. I am confident that with your vast experience\r\nand diplomatic skills you will be able to guide the\r\nproceedings of this Assembly to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI would also like to express my delegation’s\r\ngratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nfor the effective manner in which he guided the work\r\nof the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his great dedication to the\r\nOrganization and the many contributions he has made\r\nin the service of the international community.\r\nThere are great expectations on the part of the\r\ninternational community that in the new century the\r\nUnited Nations will be a more effective Organization.\r\nIndeed, its continued relevance, especially to the\r\ndeveloping countries, which comprise the majority of\r\nthe membership of the United Nations, will, to a large\r\ndegree, depend on their perception that it is attuned to\r\ntheir concerns and responsive to their needs. The\r\nOrganization must continue to serve the interests of all\r\nits Members, big or small, strong or weak. It must be\r\nmore transparent and democratic in its decision-making\r\nprocesses and work methods.\r\nIn this context, the reform and restructuring of the\r\nOrganization continues to be a matter of great\r\nimportance. Much has been done through the process\r\nof reform effected by the Secretary-General, but reform\r\nis a continuous and ongoing process and should\r\ncontinue to be vigorously pursued to ensure the United\r\nNations increased effectiveness and efficiency,\r\nespecially in facing up to the challenges of the new\r\ncentury. As modernization of the Organization entails\r\nadditional resources, the critical issue of financing the\r\nUnited Nations must also be seriously addressed and\r\nresolved as soon as possible.\r\nMore intensified efforts should be made to bring\r\nto conclusion the deliberations on one of the most\r\nimportant aspects of the reform process: the\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council. Clearly, the\r\nnecessary compromises must be made if the ongoing\r\ndeliberations on the reform of the Council are to make\r\nany progress at all. We look forward to your leadership,\r\nMr. President, in unblocking the current impasse so\r\nthat this important organ of the United Nations can be\r\nfully revamped, modernized and made more effective.\r\nMalaysia continues to support expansion of the Council\r\nin both categories of its membership. Any expansion in\r\nthe permanent category should include both the\r\nindustrialized and the developing countries. If there is\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nno agreement on expansion of the permanent\r\nmembership, the Council should be enlarged for the\r\ntime being in the non-permanent category.\r\nA central objective of reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should be to ensure its effectiveness in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nEqually important is the need to enhance the Council\u0027s\r\nunity of purpose among its members, especially the\r\npermanent members, so as to avoid the situation that\r\nnecessitated the taking of international action outside\r\nthe Council by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), as in the case of Kosovo, when the Council\r\nwas unable to act. Notwithstanding the special\r\ncircumstances of Kosovo, future international\r\ninterventions should be made only with the express\r\napproval of the Security Council, in the interest of\r\npreserving the role and authority of the Council as\r\nenshrined in the Charter, as well as of ensuring the\r\nlegality and legitimacy of all such actions.\r\nAnother aspect of the work of the Security\r\nCouncil that should be thoroughly reviewed relates to\r\nthe imposition of sanctions on Member States, which\r\nhave often brought untold suffering on the general\r\npopulace, particularly women and children. Sanction\r\nregimes of the future should be established only when\r\nabsolutely necessary and should be specifically\r\ntargeted, time-bound, subject to regular review and\r\nlifted when no longer necessary. The interests of all\r\nparties to the conflict should be addressed in order to\r\nachieve a just and lasting peace. We have seen too\r\nmany conflicts that seem to be resolved on paper but\r\ncontinue to remain outstanding on the ground.\r\nWe should strive in the new century to make our\r\nworld a safer place. We should strive to get rid of\r\nweapons of mass destruction — particularly nuclear\r\nweapons, but also chemical and biological weapons.\r\nWe must intensify global efforts to reduce existing\r\nstocks of these horrendous weapons, culminating in\r\ntheir total elimination. The major Powers and others\r\nthat possess and manufacture these weapons bear a\r\nspecial responsibility. We should all play our part in\r\nensuring that there is no let-up in the global efforts\r\ntowards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.\r\nWe should also limit the production and\r\ndeployment of ultra-sophisticated, high technology\r\nconventional weapons, many of which are being used\r\nin the wars of developing countries, resulting in the\r\nironic situation of third world countries fighting their\r\nwars with first world weapons, thanks to the aggressive\r\nmarketing efforts of arms vendors of the developed\r\ncountries. The developing countries can ill afford the\r\narms race that this will trigger, nor the huge defence\r\nexpenditures to sustain the use of these weapons.\r\nWe must ensure that genocide, “ethnic cleansing”\r\nand other crimes against humanity that were\r\nperpetrated, for instance, in Rwanda, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and Kosovo, are never allowed to be\r\ncommitted again anywhere else in the world. More\r\nstrenuous efforts should be made to apprehend indicted\r\nwar criminals so as to send a stern warning to others.\r\nThey should not be allowed to get away with their\r\nheinous crimes with impunity.\r\nUndoubtedly, the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security can be better served through more\r\neffective use of preventive diplomacy. This has been\r\nhighlighted by the Secretary-General in his Millennium\r\nReport (A/54/2000) and should be seriously\r\nconsidered.\r\nThe Organization will have to develop a more\r\neffective early-warning capability and deal with\r\nemerging conflict situations through more effective use\r\nof the mechanism of preventive diplomacy. A more\r\nproactive approach in preventive diplomacy would\r\nrequire even closer coordination and collaboration\r\nbetween the Security Council and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who would have to put his good offices role to\r\neven greater use.\r\nHowever, that should not become an excuse to\r\nimpose anything on Member States or to interfere in\r\ntheir internal affairs. There are growing tendencies for\r\nthe developed countries, in the name of civil society,\r\ndemocracy and human rights, to set standards in\r\naccordance with their own moulds for the developing\r\ncountries to follow. We even ignore the fact that many\r\nof the problems confronting the developing countries\r\nare the vestiges of the colonial past. We want to leave\r\nyesterday behind and move to today and the future, but\r\nthe pace appropriate to the particular country\r\nconcerned should be followed.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations should\r\nbe empowered with clear and well-defined mandates,\r\nadequate resources and strong international support,\r\nirrespective of where they take place. There should be\r\nno perception of selectivity in their launching. In this\r\nregard, it is especially important that peacekeeping\r\noperations in Africa — notably in Sierra Leone, the\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea — be strongly supported by the international\r\ncommunity. At the same time, for peace to be viable it\r\nis essential that peacekeeping missions incorporate the\r\nnecessary elements of disarmament, demobilization\r\nand reintegration of ex-combatants, with the necessary\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nMy delegation commends the frank and forthright\r\nreport (A/55/305) of the Brahimi Panel on United\r\nNations Peace Operations. The Panel’s bold\r\nrecommendations deserve the detailed and careful\r\nconsideration of the membership of the Organization.\r\nThereafter, we must demonstrate the urgency,\r\nseriousness and political will to follow up on those\r\nlaudable recommendations, lest the Panel’s report meet\r\nthe fate of many United Nations reports in the past for\r\nlack of the necessary political will.\r\nOn another conflict situation, it is a matter of\r\ngreat concern to Malaysia that one of the longest-\r\nrunning conflicts of this century, the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict, remains unresolved. Successive opportunities\r\nwere not grasped due to the lack of seriousness on the\r\npart of the Israeli Government to pursue the path of\r\npeace. We are disappointed that the Israeli Government\r\nfails to live up to the expectations of the international\r\ncommunity and lacks the boldness of vision, as well as\r\nthe will and courage, to grasp the once-in-a-lifetime\r\nwindow of opportunity to seal a lasting peace between\r\nIsrael and Palestine and Syria in the interest of regional\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe aspirations of the Palestinian people for an\r\nindependent and sovereign homeland can no longer be\r\ndenied. We look forward to welcoming in the very near\r\nfuture an independent State of Palestine among the\r\ncommunity of nations here at the United Nations, as\r\nwell as in other international organizations. Equally, we\r\nlook forward to the return of Syrian Golan without\r\nfurther delay. Israel must bury the suspicion and\r\ndistrust of the past and look to the future in an\r\nenvironment that will create opportunities and\r\nchallenges in a peaceful and stable Middle East.\r\nSince the East Asian financial crisis there has\r\nbeen increasing recognition of the nature of the\r\nproblem of, and the need for reform of, the existing\r\nglobal financial and economic systems, which\r\nMalaysia has strongly advocated. It is my hope that\r\nefforts in that direction will continue to be pursued by\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, even if the worst for the\r\naffected Asian economies may now be over and those\r\ncountries are now recovering. It is dismaying that some\r\nquarters are suggesting that, with the end of the crisis,\r\nthere is now no urgency or even necessity for reform.\r\nGiven the universality of its membership, the United\r\nNations is well placed to make an important\r\ncontribution to promoting the reform process,\r\nparticularly in the context of its own increasing\r\ndialogue and interaction with those institutions. It\r\nwould be the height of folly and irresponsibility to wait\r\nfor another round of speculative currency attacks to jolt\r\nus into action.\r\nEast Asia’s traumatic experience is also a strong\r\nreminder of the negative effects of globalization on\r\ndeveloping countries. While globalization is inevitable\r\nand is becoming a permanent feature of the new\r\ninternational order and system, it is far from being a\r\npanacea. Indeed, the United Nations Human\r\nDevelopment Report indicates that globalization has\r\nled to the marginalization of many developing\r\ncountries, resulting in an increasing disparity in\r\neconomic attainment between nations. This conclusion\r\nis not surprising, given the existing inequitable\r\ninternational economic order and the differing access to\r\ntechnology.\r\nWith all its potential benefits, globalization in its\r\nunfettered form is likely to do more harm than good to\r\nthe small, vulnerable economies, at least in the short\r\nand medium terms, unless measures are put in place to\r\nprotect them. It will bring about not free trade, but an\r\nunfair and inequitable exchange: the inflow of capital,\r\ngoods and services from the developed North in return\r\nfor the outflow of hard-earned foreign exchange from\r\nthe poor countries of the South. The notion of a level\r\nplaying field, which is the central creed of\r\nglobalization, would perpetuate the present inequities\r\nin favour of the strong, developed economies at the\r\nexpense of the vulnerable economies of the developing\r\nworld. It would only ensure the continued domination\r\nof the weak by the strong.\r\nFor globalization to be universally embraced\r\nwithout reservation there must be in place certain\r\nground rules to regulate the conduct of free trade in\r\ngoods and services to ensure an equitable exchange\r\nbetween unequal partners predicated on a win-win\r\nproposition. At the same time, the principle of\r\ntransparency should be applied across the board to\r\ninclude currency traders and market manipulators, who\r\nare now somehow exempted from such a requirement,\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nas well as from payment of taxes. Until and unless\r\nthese measures are instituted, globalization will be seen\r\nby the developing world as a largely predatory\r\nideology of the rich nations for the exploitation and\r\nsubjugation of poor ones.\r\nThat impression is further reinforced by the\r\nintolerance of dissenting of some of its promoters\r\nviews in their zeal to prescribe the one-size-fits-all\r\napproach towards globalization. The developing\r\ncountries should be allowed to pursue globalization at\r\ntheir own pace so as to enable them to develop social\r\nand institutional structures to fully benefit from the\r\nprocess while minimizing its negative impact. For\r\nmany countries, the price to be paid for globalization as\r\npresently interpreted, particularly the loss of\r\nindependence, would be simply too great for them to\r\nbear. This is not the time for us to re-examine the\r\nconcept of the nation State and the sovereignty of\r\nnations in order to accommodate the needs of the giant\r\nmultinational companies that operate across borders.\r\nIn the meantime, in order to brace themselves for\r\nthe full impact of globalization, developing countries\r\nmust forge enhanced cooperation among themselves in\r\na true spirit of South-South cooperation and on the\r\nbasis of mutually beneficial “smart partnerships” with\r\nthe involvement of the private sector. This would\r\nfacilitate a useful exchange of ideas and experience\r\namong them on the globalization process. Malaysia is\r\npleased to share those ideas and experiences with its\r\npartners from the developing countries, and has done\r\nso in the past several years in the context of the\r\nLangkawi international dialogue. We are pleased to see\r\nthat those dialogues have been emulated by Africa\r\nthrough the South African international dialogue.\r\nIndeed, in an increasingly complex future world it is\r\nonly appropriate for the developing countries to\r\ndevelop such synergies through strategic linkages\r\namong themselves as well as with the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nTo assist in the process of globalization, it is\r\nincumbent upon the international community to ensure\r\nthat the developing countries, particularly the least\r\ndeveloped among them, continue to receive\r\ndevelopment assistance to enable them to make the\r\nleap out of chronic poverty. Indeed, given the intrinsic\r\nlink between peace, security and development, the\r\nOrganization must continue to be in the vanguard of\r\nglobal developmental efforts, upon which so much of\r\nthe world depends. It is imperative for the United\r\nNations to carry out its developmental mission with\r\neven greater vigour at a time of increasingly scarce\r\nresources and exploding populations. This is where the\r\ncontinued role of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) can be especially critical, with\r\nadditional resources and more effective programmes,\r\nparticularly for vulnerable small island and landlocked\r\nStates and States in Africa, where in a number of cases\r\neconomic performance has fallen back rather than\r\nprogressed since independence.\r\nNotable gains have been made in several African\r\ncountries. However, Africa’s ability to rise out of\r\nchronic poverty can be attained only with continued\r\ninternational assistance, including forgiveness of its\r\ncountries’ external debt, without which many of them\r\nwill remain trapped in the vicious circle of poverty,\r\nviolence and natural or man-made disasters. In this\r\nregard, Malaysia reiterates its strong support for, and\r\nlooks forward to, the convening of an international\r\nconference on financing for development in the year\r\n2001 involving all major stakeholders, including the\r\nprivate sector. The convening of such a forum is\r\nimperative, as there can be no development without the\r\nnecessary financing to support it.\r\nAlong with the Millennium Summit, this session\r\nof the General Assembly will be remembered for,\r\namong other things, paving the way for the kind of\r\nUnited Nations that will eventually emerge to serve the\r\ninternational community, at least in the early decades\r\nof the twenty-first century. While the shifting patterns\r\nof relationships among nations have yet to find a final\r\nform and the future is far from clear, there is no\r\ndenying that in the increasingly complex and\r\ninterconnected world of tomorrow, the United Nations\r\nis likely to play an increasingly critical role. To that\r\nend the Organization must continuously place itself at\r\nthe forefront in the search for solutions to global\r\nproblems.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister of\r\nState and Foreign Affairs of Portugal, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jaime Gama.\r\nMr. Gama (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It is with the\r\ngreatest pleasure that I congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of this Millennium\r\nAssembly. I pay tribute also to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and reiterate to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, my praise for his vision and\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nfor the remarkable and courageous manner in which he\r\nis carrying out his duties.\r\nMy French colleague has already addressed the\r\nAssembly on behalf of the 15 member States of the\r\nEuropean Union, a statement with which my country\r\nfully associates itself.\r\nI will now touch upon questions of particular\r\nimportance to my country, Portugal.\r\nAs the Prime Minister stated here during the\r\nMillennium Summit, the United Nations finds itself at\r\na turning point which necessarily calls for the exercise\r\nof reflection on the future of the Organization. In this\r\nera of increasing globalization, we should give the\r\nUnited Nations the means to accomplish the missions\r\nthat we have entrusted it with, turning the Organization\r\ninto the foundation of a more stable, united and\r\ncohesive international community.\r\nThe international community faces three great\r\nchallenges at the turn of the millennium: to strengthen\r\nour action on behalf of peace, to contribute to the\r\neradication of extreme poverty, and to guarantee\r\nenvironmental conditions conducive to perpetuating\r\nlife on earth.\r\nThe increasing use of peacekeeping operations\r\nover the last decade, which we have encouraged,\r\nconclusively demonstrates their importance. The\r\nresults that we have obtained on the five continents tell\r\nus with certainty that we have chosen the right path. To\r\ncontinue this effort effectively, the United Nations\r\nmust have at its disposal the necessary resources, be\r\nthey financial, technical, civilian, political or military.\r\nA credible peacekeeping capacity is in itself a\r\ndeterrent to conflicts and therefore an integral part of\r\nthe global system of conflict prevention, of which the\r\nUnited Nations should be an essential component. In\r\nthis regard, Portugal welcomed with satisfaction the\r\nBrahimi report on peace operations. We believe that its\r\nlist of recommendations point the way to a process of\r\nreform that will strengthen the capacity of the United\r\nNations in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building. We should take advantage of the\r\nmomentum that has been created and concentrate on\r\nobtaining concrete results within the next year or two.\r\nI would stress, however, that crucial questions\r\nwill always be of a political nature. We must muster the\r\nnecessary courage to broaden the scope of the\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations. Let us not\r\ndeceive ourselves. As the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, stated, it is our function to intervene. Allow me\r\nto go ever further and to say that it is our duty to do\r\nso — to intervene in time, effectively and on the basis\r\nof international law.\r\nPortugal is ready to do so, as it has shown in the\r\npast. We have participated in peacekeeping operations\r\nin Mozambique, Angola, the Central African Republic\r\nand Guatemala, and today we are participating in\r\nUnited Nations missions in East Timor, Bosnia,\r\nKosovo and the Western Sahara, with more than 1,000\r\npeacekeepers. Portugal is currently the 11th-largest\r\ncontributor to the United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations, and first among its European Union\r\npartners.\r\nDuring the Portuguese presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union, we gave decisive impetus to the\r\ncreation of the European Union’s capacities to\r\nintervene, which we see as being offered in the service\r\nof international peace and cooperation. In the year\r\n2003, the Union will have at its disposal a force of\r\n50,000 to 60,000 military personnel, to which 5,000\r\npolice will be added, as well as a civilian structure for\r\ncrisis management.\r\nThis aspect of Portugal’s external activities will\r\ncontinue to be favoured, and the importance we attach\r\nto them is equally reflected in our candidacy for the\r\npresidency of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe for the year 2002.\r\nIn a globalized world, the existence of\r\ntremendous  economic asymmetries is a factor of\r\npermanent tension and conflict. Indeed, about half of\r\nthe world’s population lives on less than $2 a day.\r\nThe turn of the millennium is an opportunity for\r\nus to reaffirm our will to combat and eradicate poverty\r\non a global scale. It may be a utopian vision at this\r\npoint, but with our combined efforts it is a goal that\r\nmay be within our reach.\r\nIn the time that it takes to deliver each of these\r\nstatements in the General Assembly, around 300\r\nchildren under the age of 1 will die. Is this acceptable?\r\nObviously not. Could it be, then, that the human and\r\nfinancial resources necessary to fight this tragedy are\r\nso great that they force us into accepting it? The\r\nanswer again is no. Many of those deaths could be\r\navoided through better management and without an\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nincrease in resources. Health, like education, should be\r\na priority sector for development assistance.\r\nIt is vital to combine efforts, policies and\r\ninstruments. Direct development assistance must be\r\ncomplemented by mechanisms to resolve the\r\nlongstanding problems of the poorest countries through\r\nreform of the regulatory institutions of the global\r\nfinancial and economic system and through agreements\r\nthat allow poor countries to access the markets of\r\ndeveloped countries without trade barriers.\r\nI should like to stress in particular the importance\r\nof developing cooperative mechanisms between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nnamely a revitalized Economic and Social Council. Our\r\npriority should be to redefine the role of each\r\ninstitution and to avoid any duplication of effort in a\r\nfield where the United Nations should play a leading\r\nrole.\r\nIt is equally important to give responsibility to\r\nthe countries receiving aid by demanding that funds be\r\nused efficiently or requiring good governance. In this\r\nregard I should like to emphasize that the fight against\r\ncorruption should be a priority of all our Governments.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration states clearly that\r\nthe principal challenge today is to ensure that\r\nglobalization becomes a positive reality for the entire\r\npopulation of the world, and not a new factor of\r\nexclusion.\r\nOnly the United Nations is in a position to\r\npromote the partnership for change that Kofi Annan\r\nreferred to in his report entitled “We the peoples”.\r\nPoverty, sadly, is also closely linked to infection\r\nand to contagious diseases such as AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis, which cause millions of deaths every year\r\nand which, in Africa, are laying waste to an entire\r\ngeneration and posing a tragic threat to future\r\ndevelopment. More than ever before, it is vital to\r\nmobilize the energies of civil society, institutions and\r\nthe international community at large to fight infection\r\nand contagious diseases. The European Union and the\r\nUnited States recently agreed, at Lisbon, to strengthen\r\ntheir cooperation in the fight against those scourges.\r\nTurning to the environment, we must always be\r\nmindful of the fact that economic growth and progress\r\nmust not be achieved at any cost, least of all at the cost\r\nof the future. The United Nations must continue to\r\nguide the way on environmental matters, as it has since\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. But the\r\nresponse from States has fallen short — often very\r\nshort — of what we committed ourselves to do in\r\npolitical statements and even in international treaties.\r\nLet us not delude ourselves: the United Nations plays\r\nan instrumental role in this crucial, strategic area, as\r\nwas reaffirmed in the Millennium Declaration, but it is\r\nonly States that can produce results. This is not a job\r\nthat can be subcontracted to the United Nations.\r\nHere, civil society should use all its influence, by\r\nbringing pressure to bear on, and calling to account,\r\nGovernments that think they can deal with\r\nenvironmental issues by opting out, as though they\r\nwere simply matters of sovereignty. We can no longer\r\nthink in that way. Global warming affects us all. To\r\nface this common problem, we need common action on\r\na global scale.\r\nFor geographical, historical and political reasons,\r\nPortugal is a country that is linked to the oceans. For\r\nthat reason, we recognize their importance both to the\r\nland ecosystem and to the renewal of energy resources\r\nvital to the sustenance of millions of people. We\r\nwelcome the launching of an informal consultative\r\nprocess on the oceans and the law of the sea, and we\r\nattach particular importance to the debate on scientific\r\nresearch on marine matters.\r\nLet me speak briefly about an initiative to which\r\nmy country attaches great importance. In June, at\r\nWarsaw, a group of more than 100 countries, united by\r\nshared beliefs, endorsed a declaration entitled\r\n“Towards a Community of Democracies”. The\r\nparticipants recognized that there was no single model\r\nto determine how the will of a people should be\r\nrespected. The Community of Democracies will play a\r\nrole in uniting the efforts of all countries that believe a\r\nrepresentative democratic system to be the system that\r\nbest meets that objective.\r\nI wish now to speak of some regional matters that\r\nare of particular importance to my country. Africa is\r\none of the great priorities of Portuguese foreign policy.\r\nThe first Africa-Europe Summit was held during the\r\nPortuguese presidency of the European Union, and on\r\nthe basis of a Portuguese proposal. The Summit opened\r\nnew vistas in the relationship between Europe and\r\nAfrica which will surely make possible a joint process\r\nof reflection on the challenges and problems that the\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\ntwo continents face. The second Africa-Europe Summit\r\nwill be held at Lisbon in 2003.\r\nWest Africa is at present one of our main\r\nconcerns on the continent. In that connection I would\r\nmention the situation in Casamance in Senegal; the\r\nrecent conflict in Guinea-Bissau, from which the\r\ncountry is only now beginning to recover; the serious\r\nconflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia; the problem of\r\nrefugees from those countries and their consequences\r\nfor Guinea; and the instability along the borders of all\r\nthose countries.\r\nThe persistence and potential spread of those\r\ntensions and conflicts seriously threaten the security of\r\nthe entire subregion of West Africa, which could have\r\ngrave political, economic and humanitarian\r\nconsequences. It is therefore necessary for the\r\ninternational community to give greater attention to\r\nthis sensitive region of Africa while there is still time.\r\nWith respect to Angola, we deeply regret the fact\r\nthat the war is continuing, which we believe is due to\r\nthe lack of implementation of the Bicesse and Lusaka\r\npeace agreements, and to UNITA’s violation of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. In our view,\r\nthose instruments continue to be the reference point for\r\na political solution to the Angolan conflict. We\r\nwelcome the strengthening of the sanctions regime\r\nagainst UNITA and reiterate our pledge to cooperate\r\nwith the Security Council’s sanctions Committee. We\r\nconsider that the presence of the United Nations on\r\nAngolan territory continues to be of fundamental\r\nimportance, from both a humanitarian and a political\r\nperspective. Only thus can the United Nations quickly\r\nstep in to support any political solution that may\r\nemerge. I welcome the intention of the Angolan\r\nGovernment to organize elections and to hold them in\r\n2001. Promotion of the values of tolerance and\r\ndialogue and of democratic principles is essential to\r\nguarantee a lasting peace.\r\nOne year after the referendum that allowed the\r\npeople of East Timor finally to exercise their right to\r\nself-determination, the United Nations faces a new\r\nchallenge: administering East Timor in its transitional\r\nperiod and creating the necessary foundations for a\r\nnew independent and democratic State that will be a\r\nfuture member of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations and of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries — and that we hope can be admitted to\r\nmembership of the United Nations by 2001. Portugal\r\nhas always supported East Timor and will continue to\r\ndo so. Our total financial assistance, not counting our\r\nparticipation in the military component of the United\r\nNations Transitional Administration in East Timor, will\r\nreach an estimated $50 million this year, and will\r\nremain at that level in 2001 and 2002. Much remains to\r\nbe done, but the able leadership of Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello and the exceptional qualities of Xanana Gusmão\r\nallow us to look to the future with optimism.\r\nThe tragic events that took place in Atambua on 6\r\nSeptember, in which three members of the staff of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees lost their lives, deserve unanimous\r\ncondemnation by the international community. They\r\ntestify to the impunity with which the militias act in\r\nWest Timor. Two days after those events, further\r\nmilitia activity took place along the border, which led\r\nto the death of 11 people, this time of Indonesian\r\nnationality, who were assisting various non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and international\r\norganizations. We welcome the swift response of the\r\nSecurity Council in adopting its resolution 1319 (2000)\r\nand in deciding to dispatch an evaluation mission to\r\nWest Timor.\r\nThe new democratic Government of Indonesia\r\nhas, in general, shown a spirit of cooperation. It is now\r\ntime for it to honour its commitment to re-establish law\r\nand order in West Timor, disarming and dismantling its\r\nmilitias. Their continued existence destabilizes the\r\ntransition process in East Timor and is an affront to the\r\ncivilian and military authorities of Indonesia,\r\ndisturbing the consolidation of the democratic regime\r\nin that country. For our part, we stand ready to work\r\nwith the Indonesian Government, helping it to resolve\r\nthis problem. It was in that spirit that the Portuguese\r\nPrime Minister proposed here last week a stability pact\r\nfor East Timor. It is in that spirit that we will\r\nparticipate in the quadripartite summit to be held soon\r\nat Jakarta, which will bring together high-level\r\nrepresentatives of Indonesia, East Timor, Australia and\r\nPortugal.\r\nGuaranteeing peace, fighting poverty, protecting\r\nthe environment and leaving a better world for future\r\ngenerations: that is our duty at the turn of the\r\nmillennium. Only through democracy can Governments\r\nrespond to those aspirations of our societies. Only a\r\nreformed and ever more democratic United Nations\r\nwill be able to help us face this common challenge.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade of\r\nIceland, His Excellency Mr. Halldór Ásgrímsson.\r\nMr. Ásgrímsson (Iceland): Allow me, Sir, at the\r\noutset to congratulate you heartily on your election to\r\nthe Presidency of this General Assembly. Finland is a\r\nclose friend and partner within the Nordic community.\r\nWe wish you success with this challenging task and\r\npledge to you the full support of the Icelandic\r\ndelegation.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration provides the\r\ncommitments of the world community in the new\r\ncentury. To prevent conflicts, maintain international\r\npeace and security and make peace an achievable goal\r\nat the end of armed conflicts, we need to continue\r\nstrengthening the United Nations and the international\r\nlegal system as a whole. Iceland has always supported\r\nverifiable arms control and arms reduction measures\r\nand will continue to support realistic disarmament\r\nproposals aiming at maximum security with a\r\nminimum of weapons. It is appalling to note the\r\nenormous sums being spent on weapons, while the\r\nmoney could be used to significantly improve the lives\r\nof millions.\r\nToday, when there is an obvious need to assess\r\nthe United Nations ability to conduct peacekeeping\r\noperations, it has proved extremely important to have a\r\nSecretary-General who has such a deep knowledge of\r\nthe matter through his own experience. I would like to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for taking the\r\ninitiative to ask a panel of prominent experts in the\r\nfield to assess the situation. I welcome the Brahimi\r\nreport. Its recommendations should be implemented as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nEven though my country does not have a military,\r\nit has been able to participate in peacekeeping\r\noperations. It has done so in the Balkans by providing\r\nmedical staff, policemen and experts in the fields of\r\nlaw, the media and women’s rights. We have noted with\r\ninterest the recommendations made in the Brahimi\r\nreport concerning the non-military aspects of peace\r\noperations. We will be studying them carefully now\r\nthat we are in the process of looking into how we can\r\nstrengthen our contribution to peacekeeping in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe report states that expressions of general\r\nsupport in the form of statements and resolutions must\r\nbe followed up with tangible actions. We will be taking\r\nthese words of wisdom seriously in our policy-making.\r\nIn the preparations for the Millennium Assembly,\r\nthe Secretary-General encouraged Member States to\r\nengage more effectively in the international legal\r\nframework by acceding to a number of legal\r\ninstruments. One to which Iceland has decided to\r\naccede is the Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel.\r\nThe Security Council has the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Unfortunately, it has not succeeded\r\nin reflecting the tremendous changes in the\r\ninternational arena which have taken place since its\r\nestablishment. In order to ensure its credibility in years\r\nto come, the reform process has to be accelerated.\r\nThe rules of international law governing the\r\nrelations between States are now well established; this\r\nalso applies in the fields of human rights and\r\nhumanitarian law. These rules set out the rights and\r\nobligations of States and individuals. But ground rules\r\ndo not suffice if it is not possible to enforce them.\r\nThere are mechanisms to ensure respect and\r\ncompliance with these rules, such as the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and peacekeeping\r\nmissions. As a complement to these mechanisms, an\r\neffective international court system should be available\r\nto bring those who breach these rules to justice, at the\r\nsame time serving to deter potential perpetrators.\r\nWith this in mind, I believe that the greatest\r\nachievements towards strengthening the international\r\nlegal system in recent years have been the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Tribunals\r\nfor the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and for Rwanda\r\nand the adoption of the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. Iceland has ratified the\r\nRome Statute and encourages all other States to do so.\r\nI welcome the proposal to include cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nin the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. I\r\nhad the honour of chairing the Council of Ministers of\r\nthe Council of Europe last year. I am therefore well\r\naware of the important contribution made by the\r\nCouncil to peace and stability in Europe, especially in\r\nthe field of human rights. The United Nations, the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), the Council of Europe and other organizations\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nresponded to the serious situation in the Balkans by\r\njoining forces and working together to make\r\nreconstruction achievable.\r\nIn Kosovo, the politically motivated and inter-\r\nethnic violence must be stopped. Rogue elements\r\ncannot be allowed to destroy possibilities created by\r\nthe international community. One ethnic group must\r\nnot be allowed to win at the expense of another. The\r\nKosovars have been provided with a unique\r\nopportunity to build a just community in the region —\r\na community where the fundamental freedoms and\r\nrights of every individual and minority group are\r\nrespected. Only by utilizing this opportunity are\r\nKosovars going to be able to build a stable foundation\r\nfor lasting peace and stability for future generations.\r\nThe same can be said about similar situations\r\nelsewhere in the Balkans, such as in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nThe international community has taken on an\r\nenormous task in building a whole new civic structure\r\nwithin Kosovo. The development of a legal system and\r\nfree media have been two challenging tasks. The\r\nelections to take place in October are also going to be\r\nchallenging. Hopefully, they can be carried out in an\r\norderly and peaceful manner.\r\nIt is very important to include women in the\r\npolitical process. In this respect, I would like to\r\ncommend the United Nations Development Fund for\r\nWomen (UNIFEM) for the good work carried out in\r\nKosovo, not only in the political field but also in\r\nfighting violence against women and in promoting\r\nwomen’s participation in economic activities.\r\nThe importance of human rights in securing long-\r\nterm stability and security, both within and between\r\ncountries, cannot be overestimated. It is therefore\r\nessential that no compromises be accepted in this field,\r\nand our aims should remain high.\r\nThe Security Council should be commended for\r\ndiscussing the grave humanitarian crisis and security\r\nthreat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa, and also for discussing the issue of\r\nchildren and armed conflict. The discussion in the\r\nCouncil has served to concentrate the attention of the\r\ninternational community on these issues and led the\r\nway for others to take the measures required. Both\r\nissues affect children in a very serious manner. I expect\r\nthem to feature prominently on the agenda of next\r\nyear’s special session to follow up the World Summit\r\nfor Children. I also welcome the decision to hold a\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the\r\nenormous problem of HIV/AIDS and international\r\nefforts to combat it.\r\nThe rights of women were significantly enhanced\r\nwith the adoption last year of the Optional Protocol to\r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women. Iceland has signed the\r\nProtocol and is preparing its ratification.\r\nI cannot fail to condemn the terrible plight of\r\nthose women around the world who are still enduring\r\nmajor human rights abuses, including female genital\r\nmutilation and trafficking, as well as severe restrictions\r\non their freedom of movement and the right to work.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit, the Prime\r\nMinister of Iceland signed the two Optional Protocols\r\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Iceland\r\nwelcomes their adoption and hopes that they will\r\nfurther secure the human rights of children.\r\nWe have to put extra effort into working towards\r\nthe elimination of racial discrimination. It is worrying\r\nto note the trend towards increasing racism and\r\nxenophobia in certain parts of the world, including\r\nEurope. This needs to be fought at all levels. The\r\nWorld Conference to be held in South Africa next year\r\nwill without doubt play an important role. Iceland\r\nwelcomes this Conference and feels that, in the light of\r\nhistory, South Africa is a very appropriate venue for it.\r\nAs reflected in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, “We the peoples”, fighting poverty remains\r\none of the main challenges to the United Nations.\r\nPeople living in poverty do not have the opportunity to\r\nexercise many of their fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms. They cannot benefit from the possibilities of\r\nglobalization. We need to reverse the current trend, as\r\ndecided at the Millennium Summit. But more needs to\r\nbe done. Globalization and new technologies offer\r\nmany opportunities to reduce poverty at a faster rate\r\nthan in the past.\r\nWe have been strengthening our development\r\ncooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally. At the\r\nbilateral level, we have concentrated on a group of\r\nAfrican countries with a focus on strengthening their\r\nfishing industry and education and health areas, with\r\nthe potential to positively alter the lives of people in\r\nneed. On the multilateral level, we will be contributing\r\nto the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nthrough the World Bank and the International Monetary\r\nFund.\r\nMost of our decisions are based on compromises,\r\nin which each and every one of us has to give a little in\r\norder to reach an agreement. It is very important to\r\nkeep this in mind, not only when we discuss substance,\r\nbut also when the time comes for us to pay our dues,\r\nboth to the regular budget and to the peacekeeping\r\nbudget. It is crucial for the good functioning of this\r\nOrganization that all Members pay their contributions\r\nfully, on time and without any conditions.\r\nIn recent years, the oceans of the world have\r\nreceived increased attention in the General Assembly.\r\nWe welcome this development. Iceland’s economy is\r\nbased on the sustainable harvest of living marine\r\nresources. The health and responsible stewardship of\r\nthe oceans are therefore of critical importance to us.\r\nLast year, we resolved to improve United Nations\r\ncoordination in the area of ocean affairs. Towards that\r\nend, we established an Informal Consultative Process\r\nto discuss the Secretary-General’s report on the oceans\r\nand the law of the sea. I was pleased with the\r\nimplementation of this decision of the first Meeting of\r\nthis Process last spring.\r\nHowever, we must act carefully when seeking to\r\nimprove our coordination and cooperation in this area.\r\nOcean issues must be addressed at the appropriate level\r\nand be consistent with the rights and obligations laid\r\ndown in the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We\r\nmust fully respect the sovereign right of States over\r\ntheir natural resources and the competence of existing\r\ninternational organizations. Above all, the integrity of\r\nthe Convention must be preserved. We must be mindful\r\nthat the Convention provides the legal framework\r\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas must\r\nbe carried out.\r\nThe United Nations specialized agencies have an\r\nimportant role to play in promoting the conservation\r\nand sustainable use of the oceans. A key area in this\r\nrespect is marine scientific research. We need more\r\naccurate and policy-oriented information on the state of\r\nthe oceans. Coordination towards that end would be a\r\nworthy task for the new Informal Consultative Process\r\non Ocean Affairs.\r\nAt the onset of a new millennium, it is more\r\npressing than ever before to ensure the access of people\r\nin the developing countries, especially in rural areas, to\r\nreadily available and sustainable energy. Today, about\r\none third of the world’s population does not have such\r\naccess, and this situation is obviously a serious\r\nobstacle to the development of these communities. In\r\nmy country, we have been able to bring sustainable\r\nenergy to all households in the country. We are sharing\r\nour experience and knowledge with the developing\r\ncountries through the United Nations University\r\nGeothermal Training Programme, which is located in\r\nIceland and funded by my Government.\r\nThe 1992 Earth Summit in Rio created a\r\nmomentum for building a secure future for humankind\r\nand life on Earth under the banner of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Soon, world leaders will meet again at a\r\nglobal conference to take stock of the progress made in\r\nmeeting these challenges, laid down in Agenda 21 and\r\nthe other Rio agreements. It is indeed true that we have\r\nnot been able to live up to all the expectations raised in\r\nRio, but we should not fail to acknowledge the\r\nprogress that we have made.\r\nThe concept of sustainable development has truly\r\nbecome accepted as a fundamental guiding strategy in\r\nenvironmental and socio-economic affairs. In my own\r\ncountry, which is dependent on fisheries, we believe\r\nthat we are reaping the benefits of the sustainable-use\r\nregime for our fish stocks in the form of a healthy\r\necosystem and a robust economy. Regional and\r\ninternational efforts to prevent the pollution of the\r\noceans have continued to gather strength and we can\r\nexpect further efforts, in particular to control pollution\r\nfrom land-based sources.\r\nIt is my belief that, in charting a course for the\r\nfuture, we should be looking at success stories and\r\nlearning from them, rather than concentrating on the\r\nobstacles we face. Let us be guided by the doers, but\r\nnot the doom-sayers.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Rashid Abdullah Al-Noaimi, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I have the honour to convey to you, on behalf\r\nof the United Arab Emirates, our sincere\r\ncongratulations and regards on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are confident that your experience in\r\ninternational affairs will contribute to the success of\r\nthis session’s proceedings. We also thank your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Namibia, for the efficient manner in which\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nhe directed the work of the previous session. I would\r\nalso like to express our appreciation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his prudent leadership and for\r\nthe efforts he exerts to strengthen the role of the United\r\nNations in maintaining peace, security and stability in\r\nthe world.\r\nThe convening of the Millennium Summit a few\r\ndays ago in this world forum was a clear embodiment\r\nof the political will of the leaders of the world to deal\r\neffectively with the problems and challenges that face\r\nthe international community, such as the proliferation\r\nof proscribed weapons, armed conflicts and increasing\r\npoverty and debt, as well as other attendant\r\ntransnational issues, such as drugs, organized crime,\r\ninternational terrorism, environmental pollution,\r\npersistent violations of human rights and the disparities\r\nresulting from globalization and information\r\ntechnology.\r\nThe consequences of these prevailing conditions\r\nhave, more than ever before, reinforced our awareness\r\nof the importance of adhering to the principles\r\nembodied in the Charter of the United Nations and of\r\nconsolidating the rule of international law through the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the\r\nprinciple of equality and the right to self-\r\ndetermination, as well as of strengthening the spirit of\r\ncooperation and tolerance among the different cultures,\r\nbeliefs and legacies of the various civilizations, for\r\nachieving the desired security, stability and human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates reiterates its welcome\r\nof the border treaties concluded between the Kingdom\r\nof Saudi Arabia and both the State of Kuwait and the\r\nRepublic of Yemen, as an important political and\r\nhistoric event that will promote confidence-building\r\nmeasures and good neighbourly relations. At the same\r\ntime, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to\r\nfollow the example of those fraternal States and to\r\nrespond to our peaceful initiatives that call for either\r\nentering into direct and serious bilateral negotiations\r\naimed at finding a peaceful solution for ending Iran’s\r\noccupation of our three islands Greater Tunb, Lesser\r\nTunb and Abu Musa, or agreeing to submit the dispute\r\nto the International Court of Justice.\r\nIn this context, we would like to reaffirm that all\r\nactions and measures taken unilaterally by the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran on those three islands and its\r\ncontinued construction of military and civilian\r\ninstallations on them, are illegal measures considered\r\nnull and void, and do not establish or entail any legal\r\nrights, regardless of the duration of the occupation. In\r\nfact, they represent a violation of the territorial\r\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates and\r\ncontravene the principles and purposes of the Charters\r\nof both the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, as well as declared Iranian\r\npeaceful intentions in the region.\r\nMore than a year has elapsed since the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council entrusted a tripartite Ministerial\r\nCommittee, composed of the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia, the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar,\r\nwith developing a mechanism for direct negotiations\r\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran. Iran has not yet responded to any of\r\nthe endeavours of that Committee, thus preventing the\r\nreinforcement of the foundations of peace and security\r\nin the Arab Gulf region.\r\nDespite the fact that almost ten years have\r\nelapsed since the end of the second Gulf War, the Arab\r\nGulf region is still experiencing the negative effects of\r\nthat War. Consequently, it is imperative that political\r\nand diplomatic efforts continue in order to find a\r\npeaceful solution that would lead to ending the human\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people. At the same time, we\r\ninvite the Iraqi Government to cooperate by completely\r\nfulfilling its obligations, particularly those relating to\r\nthe release of Kuwaiti and other countries’ prisoners of\r\nwar or detainees and to the restitution of Kuwaiti\r\nproperty, in implementation of the resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council. In this regard, we would like to\r\nunderline the importance of respecting the national\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence of both Iraq and Kuwait, as well as\r\nrefraining from the threat or use of force, in order to\r\nensure the entrenchment of security and stability in the\r\nregion.\r\nThe Middle East peace process recently witnessed\r\nimportant developments during which major efforts\r\nwere exerted with the objective of arriving at equitable\r\nand fair solutions based on the resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy and the principle of land for\r\npeace. Yet, despite all those efforts and all the flexible\r\nand constructive proposals put forward by the\r\nPalestinian side for finding a comprehensive and just\r\nsolution to the Palestine issue in all its aspects, the\r\nIsraeli Government persisted in its positions of\r\nprocrastination, delay and stalling, and in failing to\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nabide by the agreements it had concluded with the\r\nPalestinian side.\r\nThus, in affirming our position of solidarity with\r\nthe fraternal Palestinian people and their leadership,\r\nrepresented by the Palestinian Authority, we renew our\r\ncall to the co-sponsors of the peace process — in\r\nparticular the United States of America — and the\r\nother active States to continue exerting political and\r\ndiplomatic efforts that support and promote\r\nnegotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,\r\nwith the aim of finding a just and comprehensive\r\nsettlement of the Palestine issue. In particular this\r\nsettlement should resolve the issues of Al-Quds Al-\r\nSharif and the refugees, on the basis of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, especially resolutions 242 (1967)\r\nand 338 (1973). This should enable the Palestinian\r\npeople to exercise their legitimate and inalienable\r\nrights to return to their homeland and to establish their\r\nown independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\r\ncapital.\r\nAlso in this context we reaffirm our unceasing\r\nsupport of the position of sisterly Syria in its efforts to\r\nregain its Golan territory up to the line of 4 June 1967.\r\nWe call on the international community to demand that\r\nIsrael resume negotiations on the Syrian track on the\r\nbasis of relevant United Nations resolutions, in the\r\ninterest of attaining peace, stability and growth for all\r\nthe States and peoples of the region.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates, in welcoming once\r\nagain fraternal Lebanon’s regaining of its territory,\r\nexpresses support for Lebanon’s efforts to complete the\r\nextension of its sovereignty over all of its national soil.\r\nIn the same vein, we support the demands of\r\nsisterly Libya that the economic sanctions imposed on\r\nit be lifted, particularly since it has implemented\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe also express our satisfaction at the outcome of\r\nthe recent Somali reconciliation conference in Djibouti\r\nand invite all Somali factions to reinforce national\r\nunity for the sake of restoring peace, stability and\r\nsustainable development to Somalia and the rest of the\r\nregion of the Horn of Africa.\r\nThe growing number of problems resulting from\r\nthe continuation of wars, disputes and ethnic cleansing\r\nin some parts of the African continent, the Balkans,\r\nSouth Asia, Afghanistan and other places is a source of\r\nconstant concern for the international community.\r\nConsequently, we support all regional and international\r\nefforts aimed at dealing with these issues by peaceful\r\nmeans, and we emphasize that just and lasting\r\nresolution of these issues cannot be attained until the\r\nparties concerned demonstrate the necessary political\r\nwill to achieve national reconciliation and demonstrate\r\ntheir commitment to implement relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nDespite international unanimity, shown in the\r\nDisarmament Conference and other international\r\nforums, regarding the need to limit the spread of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\r\nweapons, progress in this field remains slow, which is a\r\nmatter of concern to us. We are particularly concerned\r\nat this time as some States are striving to outdo each\r\nother in stockpiling certain classes of these weapons, in\r\nparticular nuclear arms and ballistic missiles, as a\r\nmeans of settling their territorial disputes. Since such\r\nactions escalate conflicts and disrupt the strategic\r\nsecurity balance, at both the regional and international\r\nlevels, we call upon the States concerned to review\r\ntheir policies in this respect and to promote the\r\nestablishment of zones that are free of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in\r\nthe Middle East, the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean.\r\nWe also urge the international community to demand\r\nonce again that the Israeli Government accede to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nand agree to subject its nuclear facilities to\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.\r\nDespite the multidimensional changes that the\r\nworld economy is witnessing as a result of the\r\nderegulation of markets, globalization and modern\r\ntechnology, the economic and social gap between the\r\ndeveloped and developing States still exists and is\r\ngrowing — thereby exacerbating poverty and\r\nunemployment, environmental degradation and debt\r\naccumulation. Thus, the convening of the Millennium\r\nSummit and the Summit’s Declaration highlight the\r\ngreat importance our countries attach to these issues.\r\nThis makes it incumbent on all of us to work\r\nassiduously on carrying out the commitments and\r\nundertakings contained therein regarding the creation\r\nof an environment favourable to development,\r\nelimination of poverty and free access for the exports\r\nof the least developed countries to the markets of\r\nindustrialized countries. I confirm the determination of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates to support this plan and to\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nwork towards narrowing the gap between the rich and\r\nthe poor.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates continues its sustained\r\nefforts in support of economic- and social-development\r\nprojects in many countries of the world, particularly in\r\nAfrica and Asia, be it through direct participation in\r\nfinancing such projects or by supporting international\r\nand regional efforts to attain those goals.\r\nFinally, the ever-increasing burden of economic,\r\nsocial and human development, which is the first\r\nsafeguard of the political stability that we desire,\r\ndemands that mechanisms for regional and\r\ninternational cooperation, foremost among which is the\r\nUnited Nations, be created. Hence, we call for\r\ncontinued efforts to carry out the structural reform and\r\ndevelopment of the world Organization, in particular\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly, so that\r\nthe Organization can keep pace with the rapid changes\r\nin international relations.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba, His Excellency Felipe\r\nPérez Roque.\r\nMr. Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): We are\r\nliving at a decisive moment in the history of\r\nhumankind. More than half a century after the creation\r\nof the United Nations, on the threshold of a new\r\nmillennium that was supposed to herald an era of peace\r\namong men, solidarity among nations and greater well-\r\nbeing for the poorest people, we are confronted instead\r\nby the most serious and complex economic, social,\r\npolitical and environmental crisis in the history of the\r\nhuman race.\r\nThe expectations of peace, stability and\r\ncooperation that the end of the cold war triggered\r\nthroughout the world are far from becoming a reality.\r\nThe emergence of a unipolar world in which a single\r\nsuper-Power is capable of militarily controlling the\r\ninternational scene, far from meaning greater security\r\nfor our peoples, has ushered in a new stage in which\r\nthe hegemonism of that sole super-Power prevails —\r\ndirect or covert interventionism under the guise of\r\nmultilateral actions, insecurity for the small countries,\r\nselfishness as a behavioural pattern in international\r\nrelations and the attempt to disregard the principles of\r\nequality among States, national sovereignty, self-\r\ndetermination, non-intervention, the non-threat or the\r\nuse of force and the settlement of disputes through\r\npeaceful means — principles that have constituted the\r\ncornerstone of the United Nations.\r\nWe are also living in a world characterized by the\r\nexploitation and the horrendous destitution of over l.3\r\nbillion human beings, who, while suffering on a daily\r\nbasis and without giving up the hope of a better life for\r\ntheir children, wonder if we will still have sufficient\r\nreasons to reaffirm faith in the fundamental rights of\r\nman and in the dignity and value of the human person,\r\nas proclaimed more than five decades ago by the\r\nfounders of the United Nations.\r\nThe attempts at imposing by force and under\r\npressure the so-called right of humanitarian\r\nintervention are at present the greatest threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. We all know that the\r\nsmall group of developed countries — led by the\r\nUnited States and its allies with powerful forces — that\r\nattempt to impose this perilous concept in the\r\ndiscussions and decisions of our Organization, do not\r\nhave to fear the consequences of recognizing such a\r\nright in international relations. They are not, as we are,\r\nthe Euro-Atlantic rim, defined by the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) as the probable scene for\r\ntheir acts of aggression, and the new strategic doctrine\r\nof this alliance is not aimed at them, but at us, the poor\r\ncountries.\r\nActions geared at fragmenting countries and\r\nnations, at recolonizing territories and re-establishing\r\nzones of influence must cease. The recent precedent of\r\nunleashing deadly wars against defenceless\r\npopulations, without even consulting the Security\r\nCouncil, is not only a flagrant violation of the Charter,\r\nbut it is also once again dragging the world into\r\nsituations like those that once took over 40 million\r\nlives in a single war.\r\nHow many other wars against small, poor\r\ncountries must be waged before we understand the\r\nneed to respect the Charter and engage in a deep\r\ndemocratization process in international relations?\r\nIs it possible that those who now buttress with\r\nthreatening language their attempts at interfering in the\r\ndomestic affairs of other countries have fallen for the\r\nidea that the serious problems of underdevelopment,\r\nthe after-effects of colonialism, hunger, disease and the\r\nconsequences of the constant pillaging of the third\r\nworld countries — the real cause of current conflicts —\r\ncan be resolved through use of smart bombs?\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nIs it not really paradoxical that Western\r\nPowers — while developing new, ever more\r\nsophisticated killing devices — intend to prevent poor\r\ncountries from using conventional light weaponry that\r\nis essential to nations that, like Cuba, live under the\r\npermanent threat of military aggression? Enough of\r\nthis hypocrisy and Pharisaic behaviour. The world will\r\nbe really safer if total, complete disarmament takes\r\nplace, including, especially, nuclear disarmament.\r\nThere has to come a day when light weaponry will be\r\neliminated, when other types of deadlier and more\r\ndangerous conventional arms — the much more\r\ndangerous and deadlier arms owned by a handful of\r\ndeveloped countries — must also be disposed of — the\r\nsooner the better. Yes, mines must be eliminated, but\r\nthe threats of aggression against poor countries must be\r\neliminated long before that.\r\nWill our planet, by any chance, be safer if the\r\nUnited States finally deploys its hallucinating, costly\r\nanti-missile defence system, through which that\r\ncountry’s rulers deceive their own people by promising\r\nthem protection against missiles when nobody knows\r\nreally from where they could be launched?\r\nWhy does not the United Nations, instead of\r\ntamely following the hazardous death game with the\r\nWestern Powers, focus its attention on the so-much\r\ntrumpeted yet unfulfilled purpose of setting aside a\r\nportion of the nearly US$ 800 billion, currently used on\r\nmilitary expenses, to promote development and try to\r\nsave the victims of the silent war that, year after year,\r\nthrough disease and starvation, kills more than 11\r\nmillion third-world children under 5 years of age?\r\nIn any case, peace will not be possible if there is\r\nno development for the over one hundred third-world\r\ncountries that are presently observing, as stone guests,\r\nthe irresponsible squandering of the wealthy, selfish\r\nconsumer societies that insatiably eat up our children’s\r\nfuture. Setting out to halve in 15 years the number of\r\npoor people that we now have is undoubtedly a\r\nremarkable endeavour, but how will the other half\r\njudge our goal if they are doomed to live as indigents\r\nall their lives?\r\nWhat has become of the right to development that\r\nwas once so solemnly proclaimed by this very General\r\nAssembly? Don\u0027t you think, dear colleagues, that the\r\ntime has come for us to calmly and firmly set out to\r\nrescue the issue of the right to development as a United\r\nNations priority? Isn\u0027t it precisely now — when nobody\r\nargues anymore about the resounding failure of the\r\nneo-liberal policies that the International Monetary\r\nFund and the World Bank imposed on third-world\r\ncountries with a fundamentalist stubbornness to the\r\nbenefit of transnational companies — that our peoples,\r\nunited in a great alliance for the most basic rights, must\r\nseize the opportunity to demand that a more\r\noutstanding, decisive role in these affairs be played by\r\nthe United Nations Economic and Social Council and\r\nthis General Assembly?\r\nWhy should we continue to allow international\r\ncooperation to virtually disappear, just now when it is\r\nmost needed? Are we entitled to continue discussing,\r\nyear after year, without any concrete outcome, the right\r\nto development, which our people are demanding,\r\nwhile we watch, scattered and disoriented, as the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank\r\ncontinue to strip the Organization of the prerogatives\r\nbestowed upon it by the Charter? Those who have\r\nimposed such devastating decisions as those leading to\r\nthe unbridled privatization of the national resources of\r\nthird world countries and the indiscriminate\r\nliberalization of the capital account — thereby\r\nfacilitating the outflow of the scarce foreign currencies\r\nfrom poor countries that, because of expediency or\r\nfear, have not been able to fight for the rights of their\r\npeoples — will be held to account by their children and\r\nby history.\r\nThe Millennium Summit, which ended with\r\npositive results, demonstrated once again that the\r\ndevastating effects of imposing a neo-liberal model in a\r\nglobalized world are hitting third world countries\r\nparticularly hard. The socio-economic situation of such\r\ncountries — especially those in Africa — is virtually\r\nuntenable. Likewise, it made it clear that unilateralism\r\nand duress have no place in a world in which solidarity\r\nand cooperation are the only possible means to achieve\r\nsalvation for all.\r\nIn the wake of the Summit, no doubts remain:\r\nnow is the time to act, to adopt concrete measures in\r\norder to fight the poverty and underdevelopment\r\ncurrently afflicting the majority of the people of the\r\nworld. Cuba, a poor country that nonetheless has a\r\nlarge store of human capital, has already started to take\r\naction. Deeds, not words, are what we need today.\r\nTwo years ago, we put in place a comprehensive\r\nhealth-care plan under which almost 2,000 Cuban\r\nhealth workers are rendering services, free of charge, in\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\n16 countries of Central America, the Caribbean and\r\nsub-Saharan Africa. Now, given the urgent appeal of\r\nthe African countries, we would like to reiterate the\r\noffer that President Fidel Castro made to the United\r\nNations, the World Health Organization and the\r\ndeveloped countries during the Millennium Summit to\r\ncooperate with Africa in the fight against AIDS and\r\nother terrible diseases currently threatening to wipe out\r\nan entire continent. Cuba is ready to supply up to 3,000\r\nadditional Cuban doctors and paramedics for such an\r\nundertaking in sub-Saharan Africa. They would also\r\ncontribute to the training of African health workers in\r\nthe field. But it is essential for the industrialized\r\ncountries to do their share and to supply the necessary\r\nmedicines and materials for the programme. Africa is\r\nwaiting for us. Cuba stands ready. It is now up to the\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nDemocracy within countries is a goal that is being\r\nsought. That is certainly commendable if the diversity\r\nof cultures, identities, historical experiences, national\r\nrealities and political models, and the right of each\r\npeople to adopt, with complete independence, the\r\nsystem that it deems most appropriate, are properly\r\nrespected. But is there truly any democracy in\r\ninternational relations at present? Unfortunately there\r\nis not.\r\nIn order to attain it, let us put an end to\r\nhegemonism, foster development, replace selfishness\r\nwith cooperation and, finally, respect the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the San Francisco Charter. We must put an\r\nend, right now, to the arrogance of the few if we do not\r\nwant the hopes for a world of justice and peace for all\r\nto crumble.\r\nIn order to attain it, let us ensure that the United\r\nNations truly contributes to building solidarity among\r\nnations and not to the domination of a few over the\r\noverwhelming majority. Let us face up to the attempt\r\nof some to put pressure on the United Nations through\r\nthe non-payment of agreed contributions. Let us reject\r\nthe use of the United Nations to impose a new colonial\r\norder. Let us demand that the Security Council act as\r\nthe representative of all, not as the servant of one. Let\r\nus prevent it from arrogating to itself powers that it\r\ndoes not have, thereby violating the United Nations\r\nCharter and operating without due transparency while\r\nit decides upon matters of life or death.\r\nDemocratizing the United Nations and its\r\nSecurity Council requires, as indispensable measures,\r\nthe abolition of the vexing and anachronistic veto\r\nprivilege; an increase in the number of Council\r\nmembers in proportion to the fourfold increase in the\r\nnumber of States Members of the Organization; the\r\napplication of the principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation to the composition of that body, as with\r\nall others; and the fulfilment of its obligation, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter but ignored in practice, of\r\nreporting to the General Assembly.\r\nLet us be realistic. Security Council reform is — I\r\nwill not mince words — as far away today as it ever\r\nwas. We should recognize that after seven years of\r\nfruitless efforts we have managed to agree only that it\r\nis necessary to increase the number of members of the\r\nCouncil. At this point, therefore, we believe that we\r\nshould at least work to effect a proportional increase in\r\nthe total number of Council members, both permanent\r\nand non-permanent, ensuring adequate representation\r\nfor third world countries, as strongly reiterated by the\r\nMillennium Summit. How could the Security Council\r\nbe expanded without the inclusion of a reasonable\r\nnumber of permanent members from the third world?\r\nForty years ago, on behalf of Cuba, the leader of\r\na triumphant revolution proclaimed from this very\r\nrostrum the dreams of hope and social justice for which\r\nthe Cuban people had struggled for almost a century.\r\nMost of the States now represented in this Assembly\r\nwere colonies at that time. There was no talk then — as\r\nthere is today — about saving Africa, while it was\r\nbeing ruthlessly pillaged. The time had not yet arrived\r\nwhen hundreds of thousands of Cubans would go to\r\nAfrican lands to struggle for the real rights of its\r\npeople, against apartheid, disease and illiteracy.\r\nThat was the moment when the United States\r\nGovernment set out to overthrow the Cuban revolution,\r\nwhich, committed to social justice and true\r\nindependence for its people, threatened, through its\r\nethics, its morality and its example, the secular\r\ndomination that the United States had exercised over\r\nthe entire western hemisphere. That was the moment\r\nwhen the economic, trade and financial blockade was\r\nimplemented against Cuba — a blockade that, in the\r\ncourse of a harsh 40-year-old economic war, has\r\nengendered such shameful pieces of legislation as the\r\nTorricelli and Helms-Burton Acts. It has to do with the\r\nblockade that this very General Assembly has rejected\r\nfor eight consecutive years and which is still in force\r\ndespite worldwide rejection and the obvious\r\ndisapproval of the people of the United States.\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nIn these four decades, our people have resisted\r\nacts ranging from political pressures and attempts at\r\ndiplomatic isolation to the most insidious lying\r\ncampaigns, from subversion and terrorism to\r\nassassination attempts on its main leaders, from\r\nbiological warfare to the most ruthless blockade and\r\neconomic war and from the promotion of armed bands\r\nto military invasion and the threat of nuclear\r\nextermination. Today, on behalf of that same generous\r\nand courageous people, we can once again say to our\r\nthird world brothers and to all those who anywhere in\r\nthe world defend our right to life and development that\r\nrevolutionary socialist Cuba will never cease to\r\nstruggle for everyone’s dreams.\r\nAddress by Mr. Salim Abdikassim Salad Hassan,\r\nPresident of the Somali Republic\r\nMr. Salim Abdikassim Salad Hassan, President of\r\nthe Somali Republic, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdikassim Salad Hassan, President of\r\nthe Somali Republic, I would like to welcome the\r\nPresident, who has recently participated in the United\r\nNations Millennium Summit. I am pleased to note that\r\nSomalia is participating again in the deliberations of\r\nthe General Assembly after a long absence. As\r\nmembers of the Assembly are well aware, participants\r\nat the Djibouti peace process agreed on a Transitional\r\nNational Assembly which then elected President\r\nAbdikassim Salad Hassam and he was sworn in at a\r\nceremony held in Djibouti on 25 August.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I have the\r\nhonour to welcome to the United Nations His\r\nExcellency Abdikassim Salad Hassan, President of the\r\nSomali Republic, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Salad Hassan: It is a singular honour\r\nand privilege for me to be here today to address this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. On this auspicious\r\noccasion, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous\r\nelection to this eminent position. Taking into account\r\nyour Excellency’s wide experience in international\r\naffairs, I am confident that you will successfully\r\ncontribute to the work and deliberations before this\r\nAssembly.\r\nPermit me also, Mr. President, to pay special\r\ntribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Theo-\r\nBen Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia, who conducted the affairs of the\r\nAssembly in a most successful manner during his term\r\nof office.\r\nOur profound gratitude also goes to our able and\r\ndynamic Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, who has shown exemplary leadership and\r\ndemonstrated efficiency in managing the activities of\r\nour Organization. Indeed, he has played a pivotal role\r\nin the enhancement of the Organization’s aims and\r\nobjectives, and in furthering peace, stability and\r\ninternational cooperation the world over.\r\nI am highly honoured to address this Assembly\r\ntoday in the presence of my colleague and brother, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of the\r\nRepublic of Djibouti. In this regard, I would like to pay\r\nspecial tribute for the exceptional role played by His\r\nExcellency, his Government and the people of Djibouti\r\nin our recently concluded national reconciliation\r\nconference, held in Arta, a resort town near Djibouti.\r\nIn contrast to the previous 12 Somali\r\nreconciliation conferences, held in the past 10 years in\r\nvarious capitals, the Arta reconciliation conference was\r\nunique and more focused. While the previous\r\nreconciliation conferences were based on attempts to\r\nreconcile the personal differences and rivalries between\r\npower-seeking faction leaders, the Arta conference, on\r\nthe other hand, concentrated essentially on the\r\nconstructive engagement and the interaction of the\r\nvarious components of Somali society, such as\r\ntraditional clan elders and sultans, religious leaders,\r\nintellectuals, politicians and representatives of the\r\nvarious sectors of Somali civil society. More than\r\n2,000 delegates from inside and outside the country\r\nattended the conference, the deliberations of which\r\ncontinued for more than five months.\r\nIt was in the context of this transparent process\r\nthat a consensus was reached on the agenda and criteria\r\nfor participation in the conference, based on the\r\nbalanced and equitable representation of the various\r\nclans in the country. In pursuance of this innovative\r\napproach, the conference conducted its business. This\r\nled to the general agreement on the adoption of a\r\nTransitional Charter. The Charter, inter alia, provided\r\nfor the establishment of the basic constitutional organs\r\nof the Third Republic of the Somali State: the National\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nAssembly, the President, the Council of Ministers and\r\nan independent judiciary. In accordance with these\r\ntransitional measures, the first organ the conference\r\nestablished was the National Assembly. In turn, the\r\nNational Assembly elected the President in a fair and\r\nfree manner in the presence of observers and\r\nrepresentatives of the international community.\r\nThe outcome of the Arta reconciliation\r\nconference received an overwhelming endorsement of\r\nthe Somali people within the country and in the\r\ndiaspora. Strong messages of support and pledges\r\npoured into Arta from all regions of the country and\r\nfrom Somali communities abroad.\r\nIn contrast to anarchy and civil war, which\r\nprevailed in Somalia for the past 10 years, the creation\r\nof the National Assembly and the election of a\r\nPresident ushered in a new era for peace and stability\r\nand constituted the first step of restoring order and\r\ncentral authority to the country. This was indeed\r\ntranslated into reality during my recent visit to\r\nMogadishu and Baidoa. The spontaneous reaction of\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of people who welcomed us\r\nin both cities demonstrated vividly that they wanted to\r\nleave years of civil war behind and open a new era of\r\npeace, tranquillity, good governance, restoration of the\r\nrule of law and national unity.\r\nIn this connection, let me emphasize the fact that\r\nthe majority of the Somali people in the regions that we\r\nwere not able to visit, including the regions in the\r\nnorthwest and northeast of the country, uphold a shared\r\ncommitment and optimism for the unity and future\r\nprogress of the country.\r\nWith regard to the warlords and individuals who\r\nstill remain outside the reconciliation process, we\r\nexpress our full preparedness to engage with them in\r\npeaceful dialogue, and we call upon them to review\r\ntheir positions, hear the voice of reason, and respect the\r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Somali people to achieve\r\nnational unity, social and economic development and\r\ndurable peace throughout the country.\r\nThe challenges that the Somali Republic faces\r\ntoday are monumental. My Government is prepared to\r\nmeet those challenges with a realistic approach. We\r\nunderstand that our country stands today in the midst\r\nof a crisis of serious proportions. We shall exercise\r\ncare, compassion and objectivity to manage that crisis\r\nand overcome it in the end.\r\nThere has been large-scale destruction of the\r\nphysical infrastructure and resources in both urban and\r\nrural areas. Generations of children have not gone to\r\nschool for almost two decades. A good number of high-\r\nlevel managerial staff and skilled technicians have left\r\nthe country. The role of the international community in\r\nassisting us in peace-building, rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction is therefore of pivotal importance for us.\r\nThere should be no relaxation by the international\r\ncommunity in the overall effort to provide\r\nhumanitarian and developmental assistance to the\r\nSomali Republic.\r\nWe will engage Somali professionals and\r\ntechnical experts inside and outside the country to be\r\nactively involved in all reconstruction programmes and\r\nprojects. We will also give indigenous and international\r\nnon-governmental organizations and relevant United\r\nNations agencies all the necessary assistance to be able\r\nto contribute effectively to the rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of the country.\r\nI would like to emphasize that my Government\r\nwill place particular emphasis in the immediate future\r\non the following priority areas: first, restoration of\r\npeace, stability and national unity, and the formation of\r\nan effective security force to consolidate them;\r\nsecondly, disarmament of the militias and their\r\nencampment, subsequent rehabilitation and training in\r\nall the regions of the country; and, thirdly, maintenance\r\nof law and order through the creation of effective law\r\nenforcement agencies and professional courts of law.\r\nWithin the framework of that policy, my Government\r\nwill promote and consolidate peace, security and unity\r\nin the country at large.\r\nAt the international level, we reaffirm our\r\nunqualified support for the principles and objectives of\r\nthe United Nations and pledge to cooperate with\r\nrelevant regional and subregional organizations,\r\nnamely, the Organization of African Unity, the League\r\nof Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and the Inter-Governmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment. We shall also maintain and strengthen\r\nour relations with the European Union. We would like\r\nto open up new vistas of cooperation and economic ties\r\nwith other organizations, such as the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil and the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations.\r\nMy Government will promote strong links of\r\ncooperation with the countries of the Horn of Africa\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nand the Red Sea based on the principles of mutual\r\nrespect, sovereign equality of States and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States, as\r\nprovided in the Charter of the United Nations. We will\r\npromote economic partnership, open borders and\r\ncommon port services among the countries of the Horn\r\nof Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation requests the\r\nAssembly to facilitate the adoption of a resolution\r\nunder the title “Assistance to the Somali Republic”\r\nrelating to the following areas of need: first, urgent\r\nassistance from Member States for the rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction of Somalia; secondly, resumption of\r\nsustained economic cooperation with the international\r\ncommunity in general and with Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations in particular; and, thirdly, a call on\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies and organizations to\r\nredouble their efforts in providing financial and\r\nmaterial assistance to the people of Somalia.\r\nFinally, I extend my profound appreciation to the\r\nUnited Nations for the commendable role it has played\r\nin the efforts to alleviate the plight of the Somali\r\npeople during the last 10 years. We also wish to\r\nexpress our appreciation for the efforts of the world\r\nbody in its continued search for a solution to our\r\npolitical crisis throughout the decade, and for its\r\ncontinued humanitarian support and assistance to the\r\nSomali people. I am confident that the United Nations\r\nwill continue to provide support for the realization of\r\nthe aspirations of the Somali people to stability, peace\r\nand development.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Somali\r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdikassim Salad Hassan, President of the\r\nSomali Republic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of New\r\nZealand, His Excellency The Honourable Phil Goff.\r\nMr. Goff (New Zealand): I begin by joining\r\nothers who have congratulated you, Mr. President, on\r\nyour election. I also assure you of the New Zealand\r\ndelegation’s full cooperation as you carry out your\r\nimportant duties.\r\nI also welcome the admission last week of our\r\nneighbour and friend Tuvalu into the United Nations.\r\nThe admission of four new Pacific nations in the space\r\nof a year contributes to the truly universal character of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThis general debate is taking place at the start of\r\na new century and a new millennium. Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan has called upon the Member\r\nStates of the United Nations to harness the symbolic\r\npower of the millennium to meet the real and urgent\r\nneeds of people in every part of the world. This is an\r\nappropriate time to recommit ourselves to the beliefs,\r\nthe values and the principles that led to the birth of the\r\nOrganization 55 years ago.\r\nLike many other Members of the Organization,\r\nNew Zealand is a small country that tries to take a\r\nprincipled and independent view of the world. In 1945,\r\nin San Francisco, we played an active part through the\r\nLabour Prime Minister of the day, Peter Fraser, in\r\nframing the Charter in which heads of State and\r\nGovernment reaffirmed their faith here last week.\r\nWe have always viewed the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and the practical task\r\nof peacekeeping, as key roles of the United Nations.\r\nWe are currently making our largest-ever contribution\r\nto the United Nations peacekeeping operation in East\r\nTimor. This commitment underlines our full support for\r\nthe central role of the United Nations in building a\r\nstable, democratic and economically viable East Timor\r\nin partnership with its people. So do the non-military\r\npersonnel and development assistance we have\r\nprovided to help the East Timorese create essential\r\nservices.\r\nJust over a year ago, the East Timorese people\r\nvoted overwhelmingly for an independent future, and I\r\nhad the privilege of being part of the United Nations\r\nMission in East Timor (UNAMET) group that oversaw\r\nthat electoral process. We recall the horrors which\r\nfollowed as pro-integration militias laid waste to the\r\nterritory, slaughtered innocent people and forced\r\nthousands of East Timorese into West Timor.\r\nRelative calm and stability has been restored in\r\nmost of East Timor, and we remember here today the\r\nsacrifices made by peacekeepers from Australia,\r\nBangladesh, Nepal and my own country who in recent\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nmonths laid down their lives to help achieve this. But\r\nthe militias continue to hold sway in the border areas\r\namong the refugees in West Timor. Unless brought\r\nunder control, these militias will destabilize both West\r\nand East Timor.\r\nThe murder last week of three United Nations\r\nhumanitarian workers in Atambua in West Timor\r\nrepelled us all. New Zealand was able to respond\r\nquickly, along with Australia, to the United Nations\r\ncall for help in evacuating their colleagues and non-\r\ngovernmental organization personnel from Atambua.\r\nWe committed helicopters with security and medical\r\nelements from our forces serving on the border with the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East\r\nTimor (UNTAET). This airborne evacuation, which had\r\nthe cooperation of Indonesian forces, was successful.\r\nBut the pain and the outrage we feel at the murder of\r\nthree United Nations humanitarian workers remains\r\nundiminished.\r\nThe Security Council, in its resolution 1319\r\n(2000), insisted that the Government of Indonesia\r\ndisarm and disband the militia immediately to ensure\r\nsafety and security in the refugee camps and for\r\nhumanitarian workers, and to prevent cross-border\r\nincursions into East Timor. It also called for those who\r\nhave carried out attacks on international personnel to\r\nbe brought to justice. These are binding obligations.\r\nThe world awaits action to implement them without\r\nfurther delay.\r\nBesides East Timor, New Zealand is at present\r\ncontributing to 12 other peacekeeping operations,\r\nincluding in Kosovo, on the borders of Syria, Israel and\r\nLebanon, in the Prevlaka peninsula and in Sierra\r\nLeone. New Zealand personnel also serve with the\r\nPeace Monitoring Group in Bougainville, the\r\nMultinational Force Organization (MFO) in Sinai and\r\nwith the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia. Being\r\nconscious of the many challenges faced by the United\r\nNations in meeting its peacekeeping responsibilities,\r\nwe greatly welcome the Brahimi report. We trust that\r\nthe report’s important recommendations will receive\r\nserious and expeditious consideration during this\r\nMillennium Assembly session, with a view to their\r\nearly implementation.\r\nAs the Brahimi report points out, weak mandates\r\nand poor resourcing underlie most of those operations\r\nwhich did not succeed in their objectives. We are\r\nconcerned too at the tendency to rely overly on\r\n“coalitions of the willing” to carry out operations that\r\nshould be undertaken by the United Nations. The\r\nfailure of some Member States to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions on time, in full and without conditions\r\nimposes an impossible burden on the Organization and\r\non troop contributors. We agree that the scale of\r\nassessments for peacekeeping needs revision to make it\r\nmore equitable and transparent. Any revision must be\r\nestablished in accordance with the longstanding\r\nprinciple of apportioning expenses according to\r\nMember States’ capacity to pay.\r\nHeads of State or Government agreed at the\r\nMillennium Summit to intensify their efforts to achieve\r\na comprehensive reform of the Security Council in all\r\nits aspects. In the past seven years of debate on this\r\nmatter, it has been shown just how difficult an issue it\r\nis, especially in regard to how the Council might be\r\nenlarged. There is no agreement on this aspect at this\r\ntime. And yet I am sure that most Member States\r\nwould agree that the Council must be made more\r\nrepresentative of today’s membership as well as more\r\ntransparent in its working methods and more\r\ndemocratic in its decision-making. If there is to be\r\nprogress towards an overall package deal on reform,\r\nthen compromises will have to be made.\r\nAt the heart of any reform, in New Zealand’s\r\nview, must be the curtailment of the veto, if indeed it\r\ncannot be eliminated. We have argued this case since\r\n1945, and we believe that it is even more relevant\r\ntoday. A device which 50 years ago might have had the\r\nutility of preventing the permanent members from\r\nusing the Organization to make war on one another has\r\nin recent times served to frustrate the will of the wider\r\nmembership. I believe there is very broad agreement in\r\nthe General Assembly on the need to deal with the veto\r\nurgently, so that the Security Council can be more\r\neffective in carrying out its important responsibilities.\r\nI would not want to suggest that there has been no\r\nprogress at all on Council reform. There have, in fact,\r\nbeen some major steps forward in opening up the\r\nCouncil’s meetings and briefings to participation by\r\nnon-members. We are grateful for that. I would also\r\nlike to reaffirm New Zealand’s strong support for the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform, whose deliberations have contributed to this\r\nprogress. In our view, the Working Group continues to\r\nbe the appropriate forum in which to pursue efforts\r\naimed at reforming the Council, because it is essential\r\nfor the health of the Organization that any reform\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\npackage enjoy the widest support and buy-in. Council\r\nreform is too important a matter for back-room deals.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration contains some\r\nimportant guidance on human rights, democracy and\r\ngood governance. For example, all countries are\r\nenjoined to strengthen their capacity to implement the\r\nprinciples and practices of democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights, including minority rights. This could not\r\nbe more timely for my own region, the South Pacific,\r\nwhere over the past year we have seen the collapse of\r\ndemocracy and governance in some countries in the\r\nface of disputes over land and economic disparities and\r\nas a result of ethnic tensions.\r\nThere are no easy solutions to some of the\r\nproblems the region faces, but one thing is clear, and\r\nthat is that the answer to these problems is not to adopt\r\npolitical systems that discriminate against particular\r\nethnic groups, as some in Fiji this year have sought to\r\ndo. To do so simply breeds a deeper sense of frustration\r\nand exclusion, which is a recipe for further instability.\r\nSmall States, especially small developing countries like\r\nour neighbours in the Pacific, face particular challenges\r\nfrom globalization. They are uniquely vulnerable to\r\nexternal impacts. We need to find fresh and more\r\neffective means to development.\r\nIt is essential to help countries build for\r\nthemselves inclusive and democratic forms of\r\ngovernment that in turn take account of cultural values.\r\nUnderpinning this must be robust and accountable\r\ninstitutions, respect for the rule of law, independence\r\nof the judiciary, an effective press, strong civil society\r\nand, above all, greater public education to foster a\r\nmore widespread understanding of democratic values\r\nand processes.\r\nThe Millennium Summit provided heads of State\r\nor Government the opportunity to take action on a\r\nrange of treaties which are fundamental to the\r\ndevelopment of international human rights law and\r\ninternational humanitarian law. My Prime Minister\r\ntook action in respect of six, and I record here in\r\nparticular New Zealand’s ratification of the Optional\r\nProtocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women, the Rome\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, and the two\r\nOptional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child.\r\nThe practices of child prostitution, child\r\npornography and the appalling exploitation of children\r\nto fight wars are a disgrace and a crime against\r\nhumanity which must be expunged. We encourage\r\nothers also to sign and ratify these agreements. I should\r\nalso add that we greatly welcome the recent decision\r\nby the Economic and Social Council to establish a\r\nPermanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, world leaders agreed\r\nto strive for the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons. The outcome\r\nof the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in\r\nMay, where the five nuclear-weapon States gave an\r\nunequivocal political undertaking to accomplish the\r\ntotal elimination of their nuclear arsenals, demonstrates\r\na new determination to achieve a world free of nuclear\r\nweapons. This is a matter of real urgency. We must\r\npromote the implementation of the new commitments.\r\nNew Zealand, with its new agenda partners, will submit\r\na draft resolution during this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nNew Zealand will also, in partnership with Brazil,\r\npromote a southern hemisphere free of nuclear\r\nweapons. In addition, we will, along with Australia,\r\nMexico and Japan, urge all countries that have yet to\r\ndo so to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty. We will also support further\r\npreparations for the United Nations Conference on the\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects and join calls for adherence to the Ottawa\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction.\r\nNew Zealand urges caution regarding decisions\r\non missile developments that could impact negatively\r\non nuclear disarmament, lead to a new nuclear arms\r\nrace or be inconsistent with the commitment to the\r\ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons. This is no time\r\nfor complacency. The United Nations disarmament and\r\narms-control machinery must engage again in\r\nnegotiations and other work on the new programme of\r\naction agreed at the NPT Conference.\r\nLeaders also declared their resolve to minimize\r\nthe adverse effects of United Nations economic\r\nsanctions on innocent populations. Sanctions are an\r\nimportant tool at the Security Council’s disposal to\r\nencourage compliance with its resolutions, but they\r\nmust be appropriately targeted for maximum effect.\r\nThey should not impose blanket measures which harm\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\ninnocent populations and even strengthen the grip of\r\ndespotic regimes. We support efforts within the\r\nOrganization to develop proposals for smarter, more\r\neffective sanctions which apply pressure where it we\r\nwill have maximum impact.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration also speaks of the\r\nneed to protect our common environment. My Prime\r\nMinister announced during the Summit our intention to\r\nbecome party to the Kyoto Protocol to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change by\r\nmid-2002. I also wish to recall a particular\r\nachievement over the past year in the holding of the\r\ninaugural session of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Ocean Affairs and\r\nthe law of the sea. This is a significant step forward in\r\nproviding an appropriate forum for discussion of cross-\r\ncutting oceans issues. The success of this process\r\nshould be judged by the extent to which there is\r\nenhanced global understanding of oceans issues and an\r\nincreased willingness to cooperate and coordinate\r\ncross-sectorally to address them.\r\nFinally, the Millennium Declaration sets some\r\nkey goals for development and poverty eradication and\r\nurges meeting the special needs of Africa. This year,\r\nNew Zealand was able to increase its core funding of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme by more\r\nthan a third and of the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\nby almost a half. We believe that the United Nations\r\nhas a key role to play in the coordination of official\r\ndevelopment assistance delivery. The preparations for\r\nthe event on financing for development are an excellent\r\ndemonstration of leadership by the Organization and a\r\nsignificant step forward in furthering cooperation with\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions. The crushing and\r\nseemingly never-ending debt burden, especially on the\r\ncountries of Africa, must be urgently reduced. We must\r\nalso address more effectively the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nLeaders at last week’s Summit provided this\r\nMillennium Assembly with a clear direction and a\r\nstrong mandate. Our countries have delegated us the\r\nresponsibility to realize that vision of a better world\r\nand we must ensure through our efforts and\r\ndetermination that we do not fail them.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Charles Providence Gomis, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMr. Gomis (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me at the outset, Sir, to express my delegation’s\r\nsatisfaction at seeing you preside over the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this fifty-fifth session. You may\r\ncount on my delegation’s support.\r\nI should also like to pay an unqualified tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the\r\nquality of the work accomplished during his term of\r\noffice, and to commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\r\na great African of whom we are all proud, for his\r\ncommitment to strengthening the universal role and the\r\ncredibility of our Organization.\r\nThe United Nations family is growing day by day,\r\nfor which we all rejoice. That is why my delegation\r\nwelcomes the Republic of Tuvalu.\r\nBefore addressing the situation prevailing in my\r\ncountry, I wish to share some of our concerns about the\r\ninternational situation.\r\nThe challenges of the third millennium are not\r\nnew. They have been broadly outlined by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report, entitled “We the\r\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century”. For the delegation of Côte d’Ivoire,\r\ngiven the difficulties facing the international\r\ncommunity, the issue is above all the need to draw up\r\nnew solutions in adhering to carefully established\r\npriorities.\r\nAs the Secretary-General stresses in his\r\nmillennium report,\r\n“the 1 billion people living in developed\r\ncountries earn 60 per cent of the world’s income,\r\nwhile the 3.5 billion people in low-income\r\ncountries earn less than 20 per cent”. (A/54/2000,\r\npara. 69)\r\nFurthermore, the technological progress that has been\r\nachieved in computer science and communications,\r\nwhich we welcome, has unfortunately also created a\r\ndigital gap that has further marginalized the poor\r\ncountries.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nIf, for the time being, we acknowledge the\r\nadvantages of globalization, it does seem to us that it is\r\nnot taking sufficient account of the concerns of\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly those in Africa. In\r\nfact, the rate of Africa’s participation in international\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\ntrade is still below two per cent. In sub-Saharan Africa,\r\nparticularly, the degree of poverty is almost the same as\r\nit was 20 years ago. This is why we would earnestly\r\nappeal for Africa’s integration and involvement in\r\nthose efforts to build a new architecture of the world\r\neconomy. Poverty and deprivation, which are the daily\r\nlot of peoples in the developing countries, are further\r\nexacerbated by the debt burden on their economies.\r\nIn the particular case of my country, I would like\r\nto emphasize that, even under the current difficult\r\ncircumstances, my Government continues to allocate\r\n52 per cent of its budgetary earnings to paying off its\r\nexternal debt, and, quite naturally, this is to the\r\ndetriment of the priority programmes relating to health,\r\neducation and food self-sufficiency. Adding to this, we\r\nmust not overlook inflation and speculation, which lead\r\nto fluctuations in our commodity prices.\r\nIn addition to our main preoccupation, which is\r\ncombating poverty, Côte d’Ivoire believes that to\r\nresolve conflicts, preventive diplomacy must be\r\nstrengthened and seen as a complementary dimension\r\nto peacekeeping operations in the field. The conflicts\r\nthat beset the world have meant that peacekeeping\r\noperations, which have become more and more\r\ncomplex, are now in the forefront of United Nations\r\nactivities. Preparing for, organizing, setting up in the\r\nfield and financing these operations requires\r\nconsiderable effort and considerable means. Those\r\nconducted in recent years throughout the world,\r\nparticularly in Africa, have unfortunately not had the\r\nresults we had hoped for. The experience of the “Blue\r\nHelmets” in Sierra Leone is illustrative of this.\r\nWe hope that the excellent report of Ambassador\r\nBrahimi, who has put forward new guidelines for\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, will be given the attention by States\r\nMembers that they deserve, so that acting on these\r\nrecommendations will endow our Organization with the\r\nmeans it needs to play the role which it should in\r\npreserving international peace and security.\r\nWe very much welcome the conclusions of\r\nBeijing Plus Five and the commitments which have\r\nbeen entered into in order to bring about the\r\nadvancement of women. We are convinced that these\r\ncommitments will make it possible for women to fully\r\nexercise all their rights and to finally achieve full and\r\ncomplete equality. Côte d’Ivoire, which was actively\r\ninvolved in the work of this important meeting,\r\ncommits itself, for its part, to working for the\r\nimplementation of the targets set.\r\nMay I, at this juncture in my statement, refer to\r\nthe question of the much-needed structural reform of\r\nthe United Nations, particularly that of the Security\r\nCouncil. In these new circumstances, Côte d’Ivoire\r\nwould like to reaffirm the position held by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which is\r\nclaiming two permanent seats and two new non-\r\npermanent seats in the Council.\r\nTo return to matters in Côte d’Ivoire, and the\r\nsituation prevailing there, I would like to recall that on\r\n24 December 1999, my country underwent its first\r\nexperience of an institutional change taking place apart\r\nfrom the balloting boxes. In fact, on the day before\r\nthat, a military mutiny, on the part of soldiers who were\r\nclaiming better living conditions, resulted in the\r\ntoppling of the existing constitutional order. This\r\nunexpected speeding up of events in my country\r\naroused, and continues to arouse, major concern within\r\nthe international community, a concern and an anxiety\r\nwhich points to the interest that the international\r\ncommunity attaches to my country. Up until now, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, considered as a haven of peace and an oasis\r\nof stability, and recognized as a driving force in the\r\neconomy of the subregion, particularly of those\r\ncountries that constitute the West African Economic\r\nand Monetary Union, has been playing an important\r\nand irreplaceable part as a regulatory force in West\r\nAfrica. The millions of our brothers who have come\r\nfrom countries in the subregion, and who live in my\r\ncountry, are substantially responsible for generating the\r\nmoney circulating in their countries of origin. If this\r\ncountry, Côte d’Ivoire, were to implode, it would have\r\nunforeseen consequences for the process of solidarity\r\nand sharing.\r\nOn 23 July, the Ivorian people expressed\r\nthemselves through a referendum on the new draft\r\nconstitution and electoral code placed before it by the\r\ntransitional Government. It should be recalled that the\r\nmilitary arm was involved neither in the drafting of the\r\nnew constitution nor in that of the new electoral code.\r\nThe political parties, social and professional\r\norganizations, the administrative regions of the\r\ncountry, religious organizations, women’s and youth\r\nassociations and non-governmental organizations — in\r\nother words, civil society — were those who, through\r\ntheir freely appointed representatives, drafted and\r\nsubmitted to the Government these new fundamental\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\ntexts that the Government, in turn, simply placed\r\nbefore the populace for its approval.\r\nThis consultation, the transparency of which was\r\nvery much heralded by the international community,\r\nwas characterized by a massive turn-out of the\r\nelectorate of 86.23 per cent. We believe that this result\r\nshould, in itself, be enough to put an end to the\r\ndiscussions and speculations that preceded and\r\nfollowed the referendum, the tone of which, in many\r\nrespects, was not to the liking of the people of the Côte\r\nd’Ivoire and their friends.\r\nWe welcome the efforts made by the United\r\nNations, the European Union, the OAU and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) in order to try and bring about common\r\nground among the political circles in Côte d’Ivoire and\r\nto support the transitional process. Therefore, the\r\ninternational community should be reassured that the\r\npeople of Côte d’Ivoire will, on 22 October of this\r\nyear, express their wishes through fair and transparent\r\nelections for candidates whose eligibility has been\r\nestablished by the Constitutional Chamber of the\r\nSupreme Court.\r\nTo spend time today still talking about the\r\nrequirements for eligibility, as contained in the texts\r\nthat have been adopted, would be an attempt\r\ntantamount to trying to perpetuate a discussion whose\r\nfate has already been definitely, once and for all, sealed\r\nby the people of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nTrained in the school of the founding father of\r\nmodern Côte d’Ivoire, President Félix Houphouët-\r\nBoigny, the apostle of peace, and belonging as we do to\r\na subregion that has been beset by conflicts, some of\r\nwhich have taken place at the very gates of Ivorian\r\nterritory, the people of Côte of d’Ivoire are only too\r\nwell aware of the importance of peace. The people are\r\ndetermined to preserve peace without backsliding or\r\ncompromise.\r\nMy country is not xenophobic, nor is it a place of\r\nexclusion. Côte d’Ivoire is still the only country in the\r\nworld where foreigners account for more than 40 per\r\ncent of the total population. The problems of all kinds\r\nthat arise from this unparalleled immigration — social,\r\neconomic and even political — are real. The country is\r\naddressing and coping with them as best it can. We do\r\nnot wish our brothers and sisters, who are living on\r\nvery good terms with the Ivorian population, to leave.\r\nIn this respect, we are very proud of being the\r\nmost integrationist country of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States and we intend to\r\nremain so. That is why we believe that the desire of the\r\nIvorian people to offer one single political post, that of\r\nPresident of the Republic, to a citizen of established\r\nbackground should not serve as a pretext for spreading\r\nmalicious rumours about our country and its people.\r\nIn this connection, we are counting on the\r\nunderstanding and support of the international\r\ncommunity to help us successfully through this\r\ntransition and, within our self-imposed schedule, to\r\nachieve the state of constitutional normality that our\r\npeople so earnestly desires.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kamal Kharrazi, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke\r\nin Persian; interpretation provided by the delegation):\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nand to assure him of the full cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the\r\ndischarge of his important responsibilities. I wish also\r\nto register our appreciation for the efforts of his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Namibia. My thanks and gratitude also go\r\nto our Secretary-General for his tireless and\r\nconstructive endeavours on behalf of the Organization.\r\nThe world is currently undergoing the most\r\nradical changes ever experienced by mankind. In such\r\na rapidly changing environment, the main challenge\r\nfacing the United Nations is to keep pace with events\r\nand try to play a leading role in directing their course\r\nin a way more compatible with the interests of the\r\noverwhelming majority of the world’s population. The\r\nrecently concluded Millennium Summit provided a\r\nunique opportunity for global leaders to draw up a\r\ncollective agenda for addressing this historic challenge.\r\nAs the sole universal body, the United Nations is\r\nuniquely positioned to be the instrument of democratic\r\nglobal change. It can help to ensure that the process of\r\nchange and transformation in the global system is\r\nparticipatory and fair. The focus of our attention at the\r\nglobal level over the past 55 years has been on the\r\npreservation of international peace, security and\r\nstability. Despite the tremendous economic and\r\ntechnological progress that has been achieved, justice\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nand universal participation in decision-making and in\r\nthe benefits of peace and progress have attracted less\r\nglobal attention and fewer resources.\r\nAs the Secretary-General points out in his\r\nmillennium report, the benefits and costs of\r\nglobalization have not been evenly distributed. While\r\nworld trade has increased more than ten-fold since\r\n1950, over half of the world population continues to\r\nlive on less than $2 a day and three quarters of the\r\nworld population earn less than 20 per cent of total\r\nglobal income. The common destiny of humanity in the\r\nage of globalization requires us to reject the illusion of\r\nbuilding islands of affluence, prosperity and stability in\r\na turbulent sea of war, poverty, disease, ignorance and\r\ninsecurity.\r\nGlobalization is an economic, social and cultural\r\nreality. It should not just be allowed to happen — it is a\r\nreality that we can and should collectively manage.\r\nOne key task is to ensure that the benefits of\r\nglobalization are more evenly distributed. The\r\nmillennium report of the Secretary-General sets out a\r\nnumber of realistic and quantifiable targets. Necessary\r\nresources need to be committed and those who have\r\nbeen mostly on the receiving end of the benefits of\r\nglobalization have an added responsibility. The United\r\nNations machinery should direct and coordinate\r\nbilateral and multilateral efforts in this regard.\r\nGlobalization has also further complicated the\r\nglobal menaces of terrorism, organized crime and drug\r\ntrafficking, necessitating the adoption of common and\r\nrule-based strategies to fight and eradicate them.\r\nTerrorism afflicts the entire international community\r\nand must thus be combated in its entirety, regardless of\r\nwho its victims or perpetrators may be. In a globalized\r\nworld, nothing can justify harbouring or providing safe\r\nhaven to terrorists or condoning their activities. No\r\nnation can fight terrorism unilaterally. We need\r\nuniversal, non-discriminatory and comprehensive\r\nmechanisms to fight terrorism wherever it occurs and\r\nto deprive terrorists of their means of recruitment,\r\noperation and funding.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in this regard is\r\nindispensable. In this context, particular attention\r\nneeds to be focused on cooperation in the field of\r\ntransnational organized crime and drug trafficking,\r\nwhich, in addition to inflicting their own banes on\r\nhumanity, increasingly provide income to terrorist\r\norganizations. We are prepared to participate actively\r\nin any endeavour to combat this scourge.\r\nThe menace of drug abuse and trafficking\r\ncontinues to take a heavy social, economic and\r\npolitical toll. It particularly afflicts young people, who\r\nembody the future. Combating drug trafficking is a\r\ncostly exercise and requires international political will\r\nand serious burden-sharing. The provision of\r\nmeaningful financial resources and modern equipment\r\nby target countries can enable transit countries, such as\r\nours, to combat the problem at a fraction of the cost.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has done more than\r\nits fair share in preventing transit, seizing more than 70\r\nper cent of all narcotics confiscated worldwide. The\r\nfinancial burden and, more importantly, the human\r\nsacrifice are unsustainable. More than 2,900 Iranian\r\ndrug enforcement personnel have been martyred in the\r\nfight against drug traffickers. We appreciate the\r\ncooperation and support extended to Iran by the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme in this\r\nregard, although its limited resources cannot cover the\r\nprogrammes it wants and needs to implement. It is\r\nimportant to stress that, in the absence of meaningful\r\nbilateral and multilateral assistance, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran will have to allocate most resources to\r\ncombating domestic consumption and will not be able\r\nto sustain its fight against drug trafficking with the\r\nsame vigour and energy.\r\nAs underlined by President Khatami here last\r\nweek, the emergence of a world culture is another\r\nreality. But such a culture should not overlook native\r\nlocal cultures with the aim of imposing itself upon\r\nthem. National cultures have gradually evolved in a\r\nprocess ensuring coherence in spite of the plurality and\r\ndiversity that is found in many of them. This process\r\ncreates a sense of belonging.\r\nWe need the same harmony and sense of\r\nbelonging for the emerging world culture. The answer\r\nis participation and not assimilation and imposition.\r\nLast year, I proposed recognition of the right of nations\r\nand peoples to preserve and nourish their culture and\r\ncultural identity. The General Assembly adopted\r\nresolution 54/160 in this regard. We continue to believe\r\nthat in the process of globalization, it is essential to\r\nrecognize and respect cultural rights of individuals and\r\ncommunities.\r\nWe should transform globalization, particularly in\r\nthe area of culture, into a democratic, participatory and\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nnatural process of globality. The United Nations can\r\nfacilitate this process by promoting dialogue for the\r\nexchange of knowledge, experience and understanding\r\nin diverse areas of culture and civilization. The\r\npromotion of global participation in the process will\r\nprevent a sense of alienation and “cultural\r\nhomelessness” in major parts of the world.\r\nThe designation of the year 2001 as the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations is the\r\nfirst step in this direction. The unprecedented\r\nworldwide reception of this proposal indicates first and\r\nforemost a general need for dialogue. The round table\r\non dialogue among civilizations, which was held here\r\nin New York on the eve of the Millennium Summit\r\nwith the participation of a significant number of heads\r\nof State, Foreign Ministers and prominent scholars and\r\nthinkers, underlined that dialogue should become the\r\nnew paradigm of international relations. This\r\nconstituted a proper launching of the United Nations\r\nYear of Dialogue. It must be augmented by serious\r\nprogrammes and the commitment of all to make this a\r\nmeaningful reality which should persist in human\r\nexperience long after the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue ends. In this context, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC), which is currently chaired\r\nby President Khatami, has recently adopted a draft\r\n“global agenda on dialogue among civilizations”, to be\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. We hope that in the course of the next several\r\nmonths, consultations between various delegations will\r\nlead to further enrichment and the adoption of this draft\r\nat the next General Assembly.\r\nThe United Nations can naturally play a leading\r\nrole in the democratic global change in the political\r\nscene. Crises in disparate parts of the world challenge\r\nthe relevance of the United Nations, requiring it not to\r\ntake the back seat.\r\nThe situation of Palestine represents a vivid\r\nillustration of the failure of the international\r\ncommunity to provide justice to millions of people\r\ndeprived of their homeland and the most fundamental\r\nhuman rights through State terrorism, aggression and\r\nforeign occupation. Of over 7.5 million Palestinians, 4\r\nmillion live in diaspora, and many of the rest under\r\nforeign domination. This lies at the heart of the\r\nPalestinian question. Disregarding the joint processes\r\nof expulsion and occupation cannot lead to the\r\nrestoration of peace and tranquillity in that volatile\r\nregion. In fact, Israel’s persistent disregard for the\r\nrights of the Palestinian people, coupled with Zionist\r\npolicies of aggression, State terrorism and acquisition\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, continue to pose the\r\ngreatest threat to regional peace, security and stability.\r\nPalestine belongs to all Palestinians irrespective of\r\ntheir creed. Peace can return to the region only through\r\nan end to the occupation of all Arab and Muslim\r\nterritories, including the Golan Heights, the restoration\r\nof the rights of Palestinian people, including their right\r\nto return to their homeland, the exercise of their\r\ninalienable right to self-determination through\r\ndemocratic means and the establishment of their\r\nindependent State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital.\r\nThe persistence of the tragic fratricide in\r\nAfghanistan, along with the dire humanitarian\r\nsituation, violations of human rights, particularly those\r\nof women and girls, the production and trafficking of\r\nnarcotics and the harbouring and training of terrorists\r\nhave created a human catastrophe. Peace and national\r\nreconciliation can be attained only through abandoning\r\nthe illusion of a military solution and the domination of\r\none ethnic group. The United Nations, through the\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General and\r\nthe “six plus two” Group, continues to provide the\r\nmost suitable mechanism to facilitate intra-Afghan\r\ndialogue aimed at a responsible, broad-based, multi-\r\nethnic and fully representative government. The\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran has played an active role in\r\nthis process. Also, in his capacity as Chairman of the\r\nOIC, President Khatami has undertaken an initiative to\r\nbring the warring factions to negotiations. We are\r\nprepared to continue this exercise in close coordination\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nThere are other humanitarian challenges emerging\r\nglobally, requiring the United Nations to respond.\r\nFailure to act may bring about arbitrary and\r\nselective — and, naturally, politically motivated —\r\nresponses from States and non-universal organizations.\r\nThe articulation of the criteria for rule-based reaction\r\nand the allocation of necessary resources and capacity-\r\nbuilding in the United Nations for timely response\r\nconstitute two major tasks ahead. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has pointed out, prevention through diplomacy\r\nand economic development is the most effective and\r\nleast costly type of global engagement.\r\nGood-governance at the international level\r\nrequires the provision of rational and comprehensive\r\nmechanisms to ensure security for all. Nuclear\r\ndisarmament is the most fundamental priority in this\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.16\r\nregard. It is imperative to initiate multilateral\r\nnegotiations for the elimination of all nuclear weapons,\r\nwithin a time-bound framework and through a\r\ncomprehensive and universal convention. The proposal\r\nof the Secretary-General to convene an international\r\nconference on nuclear weapons is a valuable\r\ncontribution; such a conference could build upon our\r\ncollective achievement during the Nuclear Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference.\r\nFurthermore, following the outcome of the NPT\r\nReview Conference, serious and comprehensive\r\ninternational pressure should come to bear on Israel to\r\naccede to the Treaty and to put its installations under\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nsafeguards. This would pave the way for the\r\nestablishment of a zone free from weapons of mass\r\ndestruction in the Middle East.\r\nFinally, in reforming global governance, the role\r\nand efficiency of the General Assembly, as the sole\r\ndemocratic, universal and transparent organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, must be augmented. It should focus its\r\ndeliberations on contemporary challenges rather than\r\nhold outdated debates, coupled with effective responses\r\nto the reports of other organs of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the Security Council.\r\nEfforts to work out a special political role for the\r\nUnited Nations come at a time when the Organization\r\nis in one of the worst periods of its existence from a\r\nfinancial perspective. The tasks that the international\r\ncommunity expects the United Nations to fulfil require\r\nmore innovative ways of raising money for the smooth\r\nfunctioning of the Organization.\r\nIn this context, it may be instructive to remember\r\nthat if only a tiny percentage of the military\r\nexpenditures of the Member States were allocated to\r\nthe specific activities of the United Nations, the goal of\r\ncreating a more secure global environment would be\r\nmuch more efficiently achieved.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly\r\nfollows the Millennium Summit, the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union summit, the global gathering of\r\nreligious leaders and the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization roundtable on\r\ndialogue among civilizations. As such, it represents a\r\ntremendous and historic opportunity to take advantage\r\nof the political will expressed in those unprecedented\r\ngatherings, to operationalize their declarations and\r\ndecisions, and to move the United Nations forward to\r\nan era of stability, justice, peace and good governance,\r\nthrough participation and the rule of law.\r\nCommensurate with such a historic opportunity, we are\r\nall accountable before our own people and the people\r\nof the world.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\n"
