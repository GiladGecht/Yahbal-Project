(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Solomon Islands, His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Danny Philip.\r\nMr. Philip (Solomon Islands): At the outset, Sir,\r\nlet me convey the congratulations and best wishes of\r\nthe Government and people of Solomon Islands on\r\nyour election as President of the fifty-fifth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Your proven tremendous skills\r\nas a consensus-builder and mediator will no doubt\r\nguide the Assembly to adopt useful decisions on the\r\nmany important issues before us. My Government is\r\ncommitted to working closely with you and all Member\r\nStates during this Millennium Assembly.\r\nSolomon Islands warmly welcomes the admission\r\nof our sister nation Tuvalu as a new Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. This is further testimony that the\r\nUnited Nations is indispensable and that its body of\r\ninternational laws is vital to the protection and security\r\nof small island developing States. We look forward to\r\nworking very closely with the delegation of Tuvalu.\r\nThe Government of Solomon Islands concurs that\r\nconflict prevention should be the cornerstone of\r\ncollective security in the twenty-first century. We also\r\nacknowledge that peace and democratic stability are\r\ncritical pre-conditions for economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. Moreover, economic and\r\ndevelopment cooperation have an important role to\r\nplay in fostering these pre-conditions.\r\nAs highlighted in our Millennium Summit\r\nstatement, the ethnic crisis in our country has\r\nchallenged national peace, security and stability. It has\r\nresulted in the loss of human lives and property, the\r\nclosure of all key industries in our economy and the\r\ndisplacement of more than 30,000 people. While it may\r\nnot be comparable to major conflicts in other parts of\r\nthe world, the net result in human loss and suffering is\r\nrelative. Therefore, the international community,\r\nparticularly the United Nations, must give equal\r\nattention to every conflict situation. All Member\r\nStates, both large and small, must be treated fairly.\r\nChallenges to the security and stability of small\r\nisland developing States like Solomon Islands are,\r\nincreasingly, beyond their capacity to cope. In such\r\ncases, the support of the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community at large is imperative. In the\r\ncontext of our crisis, our smallness and remoteness,\r\nlimited resources, ethnic and cultural diversity and\r\nhistory are fundamental considerations.\r\nRestoring law and order is the number-one\r\npriority for my Government as we strive to resolve our\r\nconflict. There is no peace without security. While a\r\npeaceful and comprehensive solution has to come from\r\nSolomon Islanders themselves, international support to\r\nsustain the peace process is necessary. Since we\r\nlaunched our national peace plan, we have made some\r\nprogress in getting the conflicting parties to the table to\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nnegotiate and agree to a ceasefire. A ceasefire\r\nAgreement was signed by all parties concerned on 3\r\nAugust 2000 and a National Monitoring Council to\r\noversee its implementation was subsequently formed.\r\nDespite some violations of the Agreement, my\r\nGovernment remains steadfast in our commitment to\r\nachieving peace. Further peace talks have since taken\r\nplace in Honiara, the capital, and a draft framework\r\ntowards a peace agreement was adopted. A more\r\nconclusive peace agreement will be negotiated in\r\nCairns, Australia. Recognizing the importance of civil\r\nsociety participation in conflict resolution,\r\nreconciliation and reconstruction, my Government will\r\ncontinue to involve non-governmental organizations,\r\nincluding women’s and church groups.\r\nMay I express my Government’s appreciation to\r\nthe South Pacific Forum countries for their\r\nunderstanding and support during this challenging\r\ntime. I wish to mention in particular the recent visit by\r\na Pacific ACP ministerial mission led by the Foreign\r\nMinister of Papua New Guinea to assess the current\r\nsituation and make recommendations to the joint\r\nEuropean Union/African, Caribbean and Pacific (EU/\r\nACP) Commission. We further appreciate the efforts of\r\nthe Governments of Australia and New Zealand in\r\nfacilitating our peace process through their logistical\r\nsupport. To sustain long-term peace, Solomon Islands\r\nwill need the cooperation of its development partners\r\nto rebuild the economy and to foster a development\r\npath that creates employment, ensures fair distribution\r\nof national resources and wealth and accommodates\r\nour diverse cultural traditions.\r\nOnly the United Nations and other international\r\ninstitutions have the scope and legitimacy to generate\r\nthe principles, norms and rules that are necessary if\r\nglobalization is to benefit everyone. The least\r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), including Solomon\r\nIslands, need international support to build the\r\ncapacities to enable us to become more effectively and\r\nbeneficially integrated into the global economy. The\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the LDCs next\r\nyear will give the international community a unique\r\nopportunity to review, assess and adopt policies and\r\nmeasures that could effectively address the\r\ndevelopment constraints of least developed countries.\r\nDeveloping and sustaining competitiveness and\r\nproductive capabilities, like all other aspects of\r\ndevelopment, is a long and often frustrating process.\r\nMy Government, however, is prepared to work with\r\nour development partners to address these problems in\r\na renewed spirit of solidarity and shared responsibility.\r\nThe past decade has witnessed the adoption of\r\nseveral international conventions and programmes of\r\naction, from the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment to social development and the\r\nadvancement of women. Their five-year reviews,\r\ndespite some progress, have indicated that insufficient\r\nresources remains a major obstacle to wider\r\nimplementation, especially in rural communities in\r\ndeveloping countries. New and additional resources are\r\nrequired if we are to make a difference. The United\r\nNations Intergovernmental Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development next year must produce a practical\r\noutcome on how to mobilize financing for development\r\nin the new millennium. The twenty-first century should\r\nbe a century for better implementation of international\r\nprogrammes, a century for action rather than rhetoric.\r\nThe economic vulnerability and ecological\r\nfragility of small island developing States must be an\r\nintegral basis for decisions on development\r\ncooperation with these States. Such cooperation in my\r\nview should continue to focus on better trading\r\nopportunities, including market access, capacity-\r\nbuilding — in particular, human resources\r\ndevelopment — and adaptation and mitigation\r\nprogrammes to address climate change and sea level\r\nrise.\r\nInvestment in renewable energy remains a\r\npriority for Solomon Islands. Access to a reliable and\r\ncost-effective energy source is imperative if our rural\r\npopulation is to capitalize on the opportunities of the\r\ninformation age.\r\nThe international community must mobilize\r\nresources to implement the Secretary General’s\r\nrecommendations on bridging the digital divide\r\nbetween developed and developing countries.\r\nSolomon Islands is committed to reform,\r\nstrengthen and enhance the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations system, including the Security Council, which\r\nhas primary responsibility under the United Nations\r\nCharter for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. Greater flexibility and understanding should\r\nbe demonstrated towards those that are striving to\r\nbecome new permanent members of the Council,\r\nincluding Japan and Germany. A similar attitude should\r\nbe shown towards the reconfiguration of the United\r\nNations regional groups to reflect present-day realities\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nand to accommodate those Member States, including\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, which wish to be placed in\r\ntheir most appropriate regional or geopolitical\r\ngrouping.\r\nOnly an inclusive and universal United Nations\r\ncan effectively perform its mandate in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. We must show greater understanding towards\r\nthose who request to participate in the work of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to reiterate the point\r\nmade by Solomon Islands during the Millennium\r\nSummit relating to the principle of an all-inclusive and\r\nuniversal United Nations. A case in point is that which\r\nrelates to the reunification of China, which would\r\nfoster greater stability in world affairs and effectively\r\nbolster the activities of the Organization. This new\r\napproach by the United Nations for the two Chinas will\r\nenhance greater understanding in pragmatic diplomacy\r\nand pave the way for efforts currently under way in the\r\nKorean peninsula. This is not impossible to achieve, as\r\nwe saw just before the turn of the century in the\r\nreunification of the two Germanys.\r\nThe challenges facing the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century are daunting. An effective United\r\nNations demands the steadfast commitment and\r\nsupport of all its Members. The rich and powerful must\r\npay their dues on time, in full and without conditions.\r\nAbove all, the United Nations needs global political\r\nwill and resources to maintain peace and security,\r\npromote sustainable development, address\r\nenvironmental degradation, combat poverty and disease\r\nand foster respect for human dignity.\r\nHuman problems will always remain with us, but\r\nthe way to resolve them should be through dialogue\r\nand discussion. This is the approach my Government is\r\ntaking towards resolving the current ethnic unrest in\r\nour country. Attaining peace could be a painful and\r\nslow process, it could be fragile and imperfect when\r\nachieved, but we believe we can do it. We must,\r\nhowever, go beyond achieving peace. We must provide\r\nour people with the values and skills that will sustain\r\npeace. As we enter the twenty-first century, let us\r\nreaffirm our commitment to work in partnership with\r\nothers in pursuit of global peace and human security.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Ralph Ochan,\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Republic of Uganda.\r\nMr. Ochan (Uganda): I should like to offer the\r\napologies of my Minister, who was to have made this\r\nstatement today. He has had to travel to Winnipeg,\r\nwhere the future of some of our abducted children will\r\nbe discussed tomorrow.\r\nI bring to you, Mr. President, and all Member\r\nStates of the United Nations fraternal greetings and\r\nbest wishes for the new millennium from the\r\nGovernment and people of Uganda. I also bring to you,\r\nSir, and through you to the fifty-fifth session the\r\npersonal best wishes of the President of the Republic of\r\nUganda, His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.\r\nI should like, at the outset, Sir, to congratulate\r\nyou on your well-deserved and unanimous election to\r\npreside over this session of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich follows in the footsteps of the historic and\r\nhighly successful Millennium Summit. Your\r\npredecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNamibia, deserves our heartfelt thanks for successfully\r\npresiding over so many special and regular sessions\r\nduring his tenure as President of the General Assembly.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay a very\r\nspecial tribute to our illustrious Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the exemplary work he has\r\ncontinued to perform on behalf of the Organization and\r\nthe peoples of the world. The Secretary-General\r\ndeserves special recognition by the United Nations\r\nfamily for his tireless efforts to address the numerous\r\nchallenges that face the United Nations at the dawn of\r\nthe new era.\r\nUganda warmly welcomes the admission of\r\nTuvalu as the 189th Member of the United Nations.\r\nFor Uganda, events in Africa, and in particular\r\ninstability in the Great Lakes region, continue to be of\r\nthe utmost concern. For this reason, I crave the\r\nAssembly’s indulgence if I devote a portion of my\r\nstatement to those problems and challenges which\r\nconfront us in the Great Lakes region.\r\nAs the international community is fully aware,\r\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nposes a major threat to the stability of the Great Lakes\r\nregion and ultimately the entire African continent. That\r\nconflict has its origins in the massive violation of\r\nhuman and democratic rights of the people of the\r\nregion during the long reign of dictators in a number of\r\ncountries in the region. Evidence shows that when\r\npeople are oppressed, sooner or later they will rise and\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\ntake up arms against their oppressors. This is precisely\r\nwhat we are witnessing in the Great Lakes region.\r\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s a number of\r\ndictatorships were overthrown, in spite of their\r\ndetermined attempts to save their regimes by resorting\r\nto the most inhuman methods of clinging to power —\r\nnamely, resort to genocide. This despicable weapon\r\nwas not only used in Rwanda in 1994, but has also\r\nbeen used to a lesser extent in Uganda, Burundi and the\r\nformer Zaire. The instability we are witnessing today is\r\nthus caused by the continuing struggle of the peoples\r\nof the region to proclaim their human and democratic\r\nrights.\r\nIn Uganda the people’s struggle for fundamental\r\nchange ended in 1986, resulting in the establishment of\r\ndemocracy, stability and economic progress which the\r\npeople of Uganda have enjoyed over the past 14 years.\r\nUnfortunately, the instability and civil wars in\r\nneighbouring countries have continued to impact\r\nnegatively on our attempt to consolidate the results of\r\nour victory. This has especially been the case when\r\nremnants of followers of our former dictators have\r\nattempted to form alliances with dictatorial regimes in\r\nsome neighbouring countries to take advantage of the\r\npower vacuum there and establish bases from which to\r\nlaunch desperate, but ultimately futile, attacks on\r\nUganda.\r\nAs the Government of Uganda has stated before,\r\nat various times it cooperated with a number of\r\nprogressive forces in the region to help the people of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo free themselves\r\nfrom one of the longest and most oppressive\r\ndictatorships in the African continent — I refer to the\r\nMobutu dictatorship. In helping the people of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, we were also\r\nhoping to free ourselves from the menace of\r\ndestabilization, which had become the official policy of\r\nthe Mobutu regime. That is why in 1997 Uganda found\r\nits troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nWhen a new regime came to power in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, we signed a\r\nprotocol of cooperation under which Uganda and\r\nCongolese security forces would cooperate to contain\r\nthe menace caused by the armed groups organized by\r\nthe remnants of forces of Uganda’s former dictators\r\nthat were operating from Congolese territory.\r\nUnfortunately, within a very short period, the new\r\nregime in the Democratic Republic of the Congo chose\r\nto turn its back on its former allies and form an alliance\r\nwith the very people who posed a threat to our security.\r\nNot only did this regime turn its back against its\r\nexternal allies, it also turned its back on its internal\r\nallies, thus provoking a fresh round of civil war in the\r\ncountry within a year. The result was that a number of\r\nAfrican countries that had been allies in the struggle\r\nagainst Mobutu now found themselves sucked into the\r\nconflict.\r\nFortunately, these countries soon saw the folly of\r\narmed confrontation and chose to end the conflict\r\nthrough negotiations. The result was the Lusaka\r\nCeasefire Agreement. This Agreement was a major\r\nbreakthrough in the attempt to establish genuine peace\r\nin the region because it addressed the problems of\r\nestablishing a democratic and accountable government\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo and catering\r\nfor the legitimate security concerns of neighbouring\r\ncountries. The Agreement still offers the best hope of\r\nestablishing and maintaining peace in the region. For\r\nthis reason, Uganda has worked hard to have this\r\nAgreement implemented. On 8 April this year, Uganda\r\nhosted an important meeting of the Political Committee\r\nestablished under the Agreement. At that meeting, a\r\ndisengagement plan was adopted under which all the\r\nfighting forces in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo would disengage under the supervision of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission (MONUC).\r\nUnfortunately, it has not been possible to effect\r\nthe disengagement of forces in accordance with the\r\nstipulated calendar because one of the signatories,\r\nnamely, the Government of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, has done everything possible to block the\r\nimplementation of this disengagement plan, as well as\r\nseveral other aspects of the Lusaka Agreement. On 14\r\nAugust this year, an important summit of nine\r\ncountries in the region plus the leaders of all the rebel\r\ngroups fighting against the Government of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo took place in\r\nLusaka to identify the obstacles to implementation of\r\nthe Ceasefire Agreement. Their conclusion was that the\r\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nwas largely to blame for the current impasse. The\r\nprincipal ways in which the Congolese Government has\r\nprevented the implementation of the ceasefire are\r\nrefusal to participate in the national dialogue, rejection\r\nof a distinguished and eminent facilitator who was\r\nagreed upon as a result of wide consultations and by\r\nconsensus, restriction of the freedom of movement of\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nMONUC peace observers, refusal to cooperate with the\r\nJoint Military Commission and continued violations of\r\nthe ceasefire.\r\nThe leaders of the region have expressed their\r\nstrong concern at the obstructions created by the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to the\r\nimplementation of the Ceasefire Agreement. If the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo does not heed the\r\ncalls of regional leaders, there is a serious risk that the\r\nregion could become embroiled in another large-scale\r\nwar. We therefore appeal to the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo Government to reconsider its position and\r\nchoose the path of dialogue, with both its internal and\r\nexternal opponents, and to abandon the path of military\r\nconfrontation.\r\nUganda wishes to reaffirm its full commitment to\r\nthe Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which offers the best\r\nopportunity for bringing this conflict to an end. Uganda\r\npledges its full support for all efforts aimed at ending\r\nthe conflict and appeals to the international community\r\nto give moral and material backing to the Lusaka peace\r\nprocess.\r\nUganda believes that the problems of Burundi are\r\nessentially political and internal. As Chairman of the\r\nregional peace initiative on Burundi, President\r\nMuseveni of Uganda has worked tirelessly in seeking a\r\nsolution to the problem. In this capacity, he has\r\nconvened and chaired many regional summits. We\r\nbelieve that a formula that creates democracy with\r\nsecurity for all the people of Burundi is possible.\r\nWe wish to place on record our appreciation to\r\nthe facilitator of the Burundi peace process, former\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela, and his predecessor, the late\r\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere, for their untiring efforts in\r\nworking towards a peaceful solution to the Burundi\r\nproblem.\r\nUganda welcomes the agreement signed on 28\r\nAugust in Arusha by the parties to the Burundi peace\r\nprocess. We regret, however, that a few of the parties\r\ndid not sign the agreement. Uganda would like to\r\nappeal to them to sign the agreement as soon as\r\npossible for the sake of the future of the people of\r\nBurundi and the Great Lakes region. We call upon the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to\r\nprovide the necessary support and resources to enable\r\nthe agreement to be successfully implemented.\r\nUganda is committed to the goal of general and\r\ncomplete disarmament endorsed by the United Nations\r\nat the first special session on disarmament, way back in\r\n1978. It is against this background that we note with\r\nconcern the failure of the Disarmament Commission to\r\nreach an agreement on the convening of the fourth\r\nspecial session devoted to disarmament. The holding of\r\nthat conference is critical for addressing important\r\nissues related to disarmament. It is a matter of deep\r\nregret that the Conference on Disarmament has failed\r\nto agree on an agenda for two years in a row.\r\nUganda also attaches great importance to the\r\nOttawa Convention on anti-personnel land mines. We\r\nsupported the resolution on illicit trafficking in small\r\narms last year because the proliferation and use of\r\nsmall arms and light weapons remains a major problem\r\nin our region. Uganda actively participated in regional\r\ninitiatives on this matter, which resulted in the\r\nadoption of the Nairobi Declaration. We look forward\r\nto the international conference on the problem of small\r\narms in all its aspects, scheduled to take place in July\r\n2001.\r\nThe world has entered the twenty-first century\r\nwith globalization as the most pervasive economic\r\nforce to reckon with. Regrettably, the expected benefits\r\naccruing from the process are not guaranteed for all\r\ncountries. For some, it has opened opportunities for\r\nrapid growth and development through increased trade\r\nand advances in technology. For others, the process has\r\nled to increasing income disparity and marginalization\r\nin the global economy. The biggest challenge facing us\r\nat the dawn of this century, therefore, is to muster the\r\nnecessary political will to act together and create an\r\nenabling environment for the successful integration of\r\nthe poorer countries into the global economy. Uganda\r\nis of the view that the issue of globalization can and\r\nshould be seriously addressed multilaterally by the\r\nUnited Nations and by other international\r\norganizations. We are confident that with the\r\ncommitment and goodwill of the major trading nations,\r\nthe establishment of a rule-based multilateral trading\r\nsystem that has been institutionalized in the World\r\nTrade Organization will facilitate the integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the global trading system.\r\nThe challenge of ridding the world of the scourge\r\nof abject poverty deserves more attention now than\r\never before because, as more of the world’s population\r\nis now enjoying better living standards, the situation of\r\nmany others in the developing countries, especially the\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nleast developed countries, is deteriorating rapidly and\r\ndangerously. A larger percentage of the world’s\r\npopulation lives on less than a dollar a day today than\r\ndid a decade ago. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nreveals that people living in sub-Saharan Africa are\r\nalmost as poor today as they were 20 years ago. This is\r\nan extremely sad commentary on the state of\r\ndevelopment cooperation. Urgent measures should be\r\nundertaken to arrest this deterioration of the living\r\nconditions of the people in the developing countries.\r\nIn Uganda we believe that significant reductions\r\nin poverty can be achieved through sustained and\r\nbroad-based income growth. We further believe that\r\nthis can be effectively done through modernization of\r\nthe agricultural sector, which dominates the economy\r\nand employs the majority of our population. That is\r\nwhy in the past two years we have been working to\r\ndevelop a comprehensive set of policies for the\r\nmodernization of agriculture, as part of the\r\nGovernment’s broader strategy for poverty eradication.\r\nUganda welcomes and fully endorses the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations on specific actions that\r\nneed to be taken both nationally and at the international\r\nlevel to reduce the number of people living in extreme\r\npoverty.\r\nThe past decade has witnessed an unabated\r\ndeterioration in the socio-economic conditions of the\r\nleast developed countries. A quick review of progress\r\nin the implementation of the Programme of Action for\r\nthe Least Developed Countries for the 1990s will show\r\nthat there have been more setbacks than progress.\r\nWhile the least developed countries have undertaken\r\nfar-reaching and sometimes painful measures of\r\nadjustment and reform, the actions by the international\r\ncommunity have fallen short of their commitments to\r\nprovide adequate external support to complement their\r\nefforts. As a result, the least developed countries\r\ncontinue to suffer from the lack of supportive external\r\nresources for development, owing to a steady decline in\r\nthe flow of official development assistance.\r\nWhile it is true that foreign direct investment\r\nflows have increased significantly in the past decade,\r\nthe least developed countries are not yet equipped to\r\nattract such investment to a significant extent. High\r\nlevels of external debt have negatively affected their\r\neconomies, and despite decades of liberalization most\r\nindustrialized countries still maintain protectionist\r\nmeasures in their markets, especially for agricultural\r\nproducts and textiles — the two sectors in which\r\ndeveloping countries have a recognized comparative\r\nadvantage. All these factors have had the combined\r\neffect of stunting further the economic and social\r\nprospects of the least developed countries.\r\nIn this regard, Uganda strongly supports the\r\nSecretary-General in urging the industrialized countries\r\nto consider granting duty-free and quota-free access to\r\nexports from the least developed countries, as a\r\ndemonstration of their commitment to the integration\r\nof the least developed countries into the global trading\r\nsystem. My delegation also urges the General\r\nAssembly to adopt the recommendations of the tenth\r\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment contained in the Bangkok Consensus and\r\nPlan of Action for least developed countries. We call\r\nupon the leading industrialized countries to live up to\r\ntheir commitments in the context of the agreement they\r\nreached in 1999 at the Cologne G-8 Summit. We also\r\ncall for stronger support for relevant United Nations\r\nbodies such as the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development (UNCTAD) to enable effective\r\nimplementation of their mandates to assist the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWith specific reference to the African continent,\r\nwhere 33 of the 48 least developed countries are found,\r\nthe socio-economic situation is much more precarious\r\ndespite many efforts by many African countries\r\nindividually and collectively to lay solid foundations\r\nfor development. The difficulty in achieving positive\r\nresults in Africa’s development has been further\r\ncomplicated by the severity of Africa’s AIDS crisis.\r\nWe call upon the international community to lend\r\nsupport to Africa’s own efforts to realize the objective\r\nof the African renaissance, which aims to place the\r\ncontinent at the forefront of human development and\r\nprogress. The international community should support\r\nthe efforts of African countries by fulfilling\r\ncommitments made in the context of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s. These commitments include the reduction of\r\nAfrican debt, adequate resource flows, provision of\r\ngreater market access and assistance in diversification\r\nand capacity-building. In this connection, Uganda\r\nsupports the proposals made by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report to this session.\r\nI reiterate Uganda’s commitment to uphold the\r\nvalues and principles enshrined in the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. I pledge our\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nGovernment’s continued adherence to international\r\nhuman rights Conventions and norms.\r\nIn pursuit of an international human rights\r\nregime, it is imperative that we establish effective\r\ninstitutions and mechanisms for this purpose. Uganda\r\nwill continue to support and work towards the\r\nestablishment of a strong International Criminal Court.\r\nOf particular concern to us is the deterrence and\r\npunishment of the crime of genocide, which remains a\r\ncontinuing threat in our region.\r\nAt the national level, in a bid to implement the\r\nfundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution,\r\nUgandans voted on 29 June 2000 in a referendum for a\r\npolitical system of their choice. I take this opportunity\r\nto thank the international community for its support for\r\nthe success of the referendum exercise. I am happy to\r\nreport that the referendum was declared free and fair\r\nby both local and international observers. This\r\nexperience convinces us that the referendum proposed\r\nfor Western Sahara should be conducted as soon as\r\npossible. It offers the best alternative to the possibility\r\nof continued armed conflict.\r\nIn our struggle to end internal conflict,\r\nParliament enacted the Amnesty Act 2000. Under that\r\nAct, an Amnesty Commission has now been\r\nestablished and is operational. The mandate of the\r\nCommission is to monitor programmes of\r\ndemobilization, reintegration and resettlement of\r\nreturnees, coordinate a programme of sensitization of\r\nthe general public on the amnesty law, consider and\r\npromote appropriate reconciliation mechanisms in the\r\naffected areas and promote dialogue and reconciliation\r\nin the spirit of the Amnesty Act. There is a programme\r\nof reintegration into society, which involves acquisition\r\nof skills and a fund to promote self-employment. It is\r\nour hope that this process will bring to an end internal\r\nconflict and all human rights violations associated with\r\nconflict situations.\r\nIn closing, Uganda believes that as we enter the\r\nnew century the United Nations should be reformed,\r\nequipped and provided with the necessary resources to\r\nimplement effectively and efficiently the mandates the\r\nGeneral Assembly and other principal organs of the\r\nOrganization have entrusted to it. In this connection,\r\nUganda hopes that the long-drawn-out negotiations on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council will be finalized at\r\nthe current session of the General Assembly. We are\r\ncommitted to the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) on this matter, and would support Japan and\r\nGermany as permanent members of an expanded\r\nSecurity Council, as well as one permanent member\r\neach from Africa, Asia and Latin America.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable George Odlum, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and International Trade of Saint Lucia.\r\nMr. Odlum (Saint Lucia): Humanity, our greatest\r\nconcern, is the reason why we are gathered here today.\r\nHumanity stands at a defining moment in world\r\nhistory. The challenge before us is to harness the\r\ncollective consciousness and will of the international\r\ncommunity to address the problems of planet Earth.\r\nDuring the course of the past century, the\r\ndisparities between and within nations have widened.\r\nPoverty, ill-health, illiteracy and hunger among the\r\nworld’s people have increased. The world’s ecosystem,\r\nthe foundation upon which we all depend for survival,\r\nis rapidly deteriorating. That is why we must regard\r\nthis moment as significant in human history, despite\r\nFukuyama’s claim that history has ended. The Third\r\nMillennium offers us the opportunity to break away\r\nfrom the shackles of the past and create new\r\nbeginnings. The choices that we make can change the\r\nface of humankind and lead to the accepted goals of\r\nglobal peace, economic and human security and the\r\ngreater good of humanity.\r\nThe past century was replete with examples of\r\nnations preening themselves for conquest and\r\ndomination. The conquistadors who plundered the New\r\nWorld are still at large, using global institutions, new\r\ntechnologies and weapons of destruction to oppress and\r\ndominate the weak, the innocent and the dispossessed\r\nsectors of mankind. The message that Saint Lucia\r\nbrings to this Millennium Assembly comes from the\r\npen of Saint Lucia’s Nobel Prize Laureate Derek\r\nWalcott, who reminds us that, “There are no worlds to\r\nconquer/But worlds to re-create”.\r\nMinds that are historically poisoned with\r\nconquest can hardly experience the essential\r\nequanimity and calm of re-creation. The theme of this\r\nmillennium Assembly reaches out in the direction of\r\nre-creation: a people-centred reshaping of the role and\r\nfunction of the United Nations and a purposeful moral\r\nthrust in re-creating the battered, demoralized societies\r\nin which we live.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nThat is why we must embrace the United Nations\r\nMillennium Summit’s theme, “We the peoples: The\r\nRole of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.\r\nThe attainment of meaningful transformation in the\r\nworld system calls for a United Nations capable of\r\nassuming a vanguard role in development and in\r\nadvancing human society and security. The United\r\nNations system must play a critical role in promoting\r\nglobal responsibility. Global responsibility implicitly\r\ninvolves some form of moral commitment to human\r\nwelfare. It is the formulation of economic programmes\r\ndesigned to bring about economic redistribution, to\r\nsafeguard against economic crises and to formulate\r\ndevelopmental policies that are in keeping with\r\nenvironmental protection and sustainability.\r\nThe United Nations should be strengthened to\r\nplay a more central role in development, ensuring\r\nequity and security for its small, vulnerable Members\r\nlike Saint Lucia against the greed of profit-driven\r\nPowers. Instead, we are witnessing a consistent,\r\nsystemic weakening of the United Nations’ role in\r\ndevelopment, with development issues being left to\r\nundemocratic institutions like the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), which perpetuate global\r\neconomic inequities and ignore the development issues\r\nand concerns of developing countries.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), the United Nations’ primary development\r\nagency, is now reoriented to giving advice in\r\ngovernance and democratic elections. The United\r\nNations therefore plays a peripheral role in\r\ndevelopment, and small States like Saint Lucia are left\r\non their own to be devoured by powerful States backed\r\nby powerful transnational corporations.\r\nSaint Lucia joined this Organization and\r\nentrusted it with our hopes of peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. This Organization has passed on our trust\r\nto a few dominant Powers and corporations. If the\r\nUnited Nations has a diminished role in ensuring\r\ndevelopment, peace and security for its small and\r\nvulnerable Members, then our presence here is an\r\nunnecessary diversion of our scarce resources. In these\r\ncircumstances we feel threatened and vulnerable that\r\nour trust has been betrayed.\r\nThe greater good of human security cannot be\r\nfostered simply through peacekeeping operations and\r\nhumanitarian missions. There must be a global drive to\r\nempower people, through the elimination of the\r\nadverse conditions that cause the incapacitation of the\r\nhuman spirit and the imprisonment of the imagination.\r\nHence, the United Nations of the twenty-first century\r\nmust be capable of playing a significant role in\r\nliberating the human spirit and imagination through\r\neducation and real opportunity. It must be able to\r\nreposition itself to give practical meaning to the rising\r\ntide all over the world as the common man aspires to\r\nhigher and wider horizons.\r\nIn reaffirming our faith in the United Nations and\r\nits Charter, it is again with the hope of saving\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. The\r\nthreat to peace does not necessarily emanate from\r\nmilitary warfare. There are new forms of war currently\r\nbeing waged on the small, the weak and the vulnerable.\r\nIn previous addresses to this Assembly, and in the\r\nstatement of our Head of Government to the\r\nMillennium Summit, we pointed out the injustice\r\nperpetrated on Saint Lucia and other banana-producing\r\ncountries of the Caribbean by the WTO, through its\r\nrejection of the marketing regime for bananas in\r\nEurope as being WTO-incompatible. That ruling has\r\ncondemned our countries to the prospect of economic\r\nruin, in that the stabilizing force of our economy has\r\nbeen dealt a mortal blow.\r\nSince that ruling by the WTO, which granted an\r\nunreasonably limited time to adjust our economy, we\r\nhave lost 50 per cent of our foreign exchange earnings,\r\nwhile thousands of farmers have become unemployed\r\nand poverty and crime are on the increase. Yet, despite\r\nour urgent economic situation, negotiations between\r\nthe European Union (EU) and the United States have\r\nbeen stalled. Saint Lucia calls on the United States to\r\nresume discussions with the European Union on a new\r\nmarketing system for bananas that could be acceptable\r\nto all, giving due consideration to the Caribbean\r\nproposal. But that is a pipedream. Our hopes have\r\nslipped on a banana skin, because there is a new\r\nsweetheart deal between Britain and the United States.\r\nResilient a people as we are, we are moving to\r\ndiversify our economies and to build another sector —\r\nfinancial services. Again, the economic giants are\r\ndetermined to crush our development efforts and\r\nsubject our people to poverty by attacking yet another\r\nsector of our narrow economic base.\r\nSaint Lucia has acted in good faith in fulfilling\r\nour obligations to the Charter of the United Nations,\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nassuming equality of all Member States. We have\r\nrespected the territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence of other Member States and have never\r\ninterfered in the internal affairs of another State.\r\nToday, the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) has chosen to\r\ndictate the tax policies of Saint Lucia and other\r\nCaribbean islands by labelling our tax regime as a\r\nharmful tax haven and is threatening to impose\r\nsanctions for non-compliance with its prescribed\r\nchanges to our tax policies.\r\nIt is Saint Lucia’s sovereign right to determine its\r\ntaxes. We cannot tell the OECD countries what taxes to\r\nimpose, nor do we expect interference in the exercise\r\nof the sacred right entrusted to us by our citizens. Our\r\ndevelopment options are few and limited, and we\r\nconsider the OECD action a violation of our basic\r\nhuman right to development and to pursue a decent\r\nstandard of living for our people.\r\nOur peace is threatened, our democracy is being\r\nundermined. The conditions for conflict are being\r\ncreated in my country and in the region, and yet,\r\ninstead of addressing development, we are being asked\r\nto strengthen the United Nations to intervene in\r\nnational crises.\r\nWithin the context of a globalized world, the\r\nconcept of sovereignty is fast becoming an endangered\r\nspecies. No self-respecting nation would willingly\r\nabandon its sovereignty for the illusion of a better\r\nworld, when all the signals from this brave new world\r\nare destructive and negative. In respect of\r\npeacekeeping interventions, one can surrender\r\nsovereignty to avoid a holocaust but certainly not to\r\npermit well-heeled rapacious countries to hog the\r\ncapital flows in the financial services sector.\r\nMr. Lelong (Haiti), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nLast week, through our Heads of State and\r\nGovernment, we reaffirmed our faith in the United\r\nNations and its Charter as indispensable foundations\r\nfor a more peaceful, prosperous and just world. This\r\nreaffirmation is of particular significance to small\r\ndeveloping States like Saint Lucia, lacking the size and\r\nresources to urge the international community to give\r\ndue consideration to our concerns and interests. We\r\nagreed to entrust the United Nations with ensuring\r\nequality among States. It is of paramount importance to\r\nus that the United Nations does not flinch in its role of\r\nfostering international dialogue and consensus\r\nbuilding, so that the concerns and interests of all\r\nMember States are adequately addressed and reflected\r\nin the work of the Organization. We do not expect our\r\ntrust to be given to more powerful influences to\r\ndetermine our collective future. We rededicated\r\nourselves to upholding the principle of equality of\r\nStates and expect that equality to be realized in policy\r\ndirectives of the United Nations with a balance in\r\nrepresentation of the interests of Member States and\r\nregions.\r\nSaint Lucia calls on the United Nations to assume\r\nits rightful, central role in development and the\r\ngovernance of globalization, to promote democracy\r\nand good government nationally and internationally, to\r\nstand for right and the protection of its weak and\r\nvulnerable Members against the powerful and\r\ndominant and to seek equality and justice for all. This\r\nshould be the focus of the United Nations in the new\r\nmillennium if poverty is to be eradicated and peace\r\nenjoyed.\r\nSaint Lucia cannot be enthusiastic about other\r\nissues until development and equity in the global\r\neconomy become a priority. Our decline in revenues\r\ndenies us the capacity to increase our contribution to\r\npeacekeeping, and we will be reluctant to do so until\r\nthere is an increase in our participation and benefit\r\nfrom the global economy. Man cannot live by\r\ngovernance alone or peace alone. Our people must find\r\nthe sustenance that will enable them to participate in\r\ngovernance and peace. Saint Lucia therefore eagerly\r\nlooks forward to the convening of the\r\nintergovernmental conference on financing for\r\ndevelopment to discuss in a holistic manner issues of\r\ntrade, finance and monetary matters in the context of\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization.\r\nWe have always promoted an integrated approach\r\nto development and global issues, and this age of\r\ntechnology and interdependence lends itself more than\r\never to the integrated approach of assessing and\r\naddressing the issues at hand.\r\nWe continue to view the financing for\r\ndevelopment process as the missing and the critical\r\nlink in the development agenda for a sustainable and\r\nlasting resolution to poverty and threats to peace. We\r\nhope that through this process the United Nations will\r\nreclaim its legitimate role in development, entrusted to\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nit in the Charter, and promote the effective\r\nparticipation of all its Member States in the governance\r\nof the global economy and globalization, for the\r\nbenefit of all the peoples of the world.\r\nThe greatest threat to world peace and democracy\r\nis the systemic imbalances and inequities in the global\r\neconomy and the institutions that govern it. This\r\nsituation is unsustainable and explosive. The thrust of\r\nmany statements made during the Millennium Summit\r\nand this session has been to strengthen peacekeeping\r\nefforts with resources and personnel. We recognize that\r\nthere is need for improvement in peacekeeping efforts\r\nto make them more effective. However, equal emphasis\r\nand effort are not being committed to addressing the\r\nreal threats to peace and the primary causes of war.\r\nDeveloping countries are threatened by continued\r\ndeprivation and inequities in the global economy.\r\nUnless these inequities and imbalances are corrected,\r\nwe will continue to create situations of unrest and\r\nthreaten intervention while causes go unaddressed.\r\nSimilarly, we parade the fashionable notion of\r\npoverty eradication in isolation, ignoring the complex,\r\nmulti-faceted nature of poverty and the causes of\r\npoverty, including global economic inequities. This\r\nfaçade to placate the poorest is fooling some of the\r\npeople, but not all of the world’s poor. The holistic\r\nnature of development takes precedence over the\r\npalliative of poverty eradication. International\r\ncooperation in development should instead be\r\ndemonstrated through meeting the United Nations\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product in\r\noverseas development assistance, through debt\r\ncancellation, special and differential treatment on a\r\ncontractual basis for developing countries and adequate\r\nfinancial support for the United Nations’ development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment to\r\npromoting democracy, albeit with the emphasis on\r\ndemocracy at the national level. The inherent problem\r\nin achieving this objective is clear, since democracy at\r\nthe national level is undermined by the lack of a\r\ncommensurate level of democracy at the international\r\nlevel. The world’s peoples and leaders will rightly\r\nmock the call for democracy if this principle is not\r\nequally applied in the Security Council, the Bretton\r\nWoods Institutions and the World Trade Organization,\r\nthe main institutions that currently govern world affairs\r\nin peace, security and the world economy, respectively.\r\nThe United Nations must demonstrate leadership of\r\ndemocracy at the global level if we are to believe in\r\nthis principle as a foundation for peace and prosperity\r\nin the new millennium. All Member States must be\r\nable effectively to participate in matters of peace,\r\nsecurity and the global economy in order to give real\r\nmeaning to democracy and governance.\r\nThe symbolism of the United Nations is\r\nuniversally recognized, but our role in this millennium\r\nis to redefine its goals, sharpen its focus and make it a\r\nmore efficient instrument for effecting global change\r\nand development. But this institutional change must be\r\ninspired and fired by the commensurate determination\r\nof Member nations to re-create their own societies. The\r\nresonance and sympathetic vibration of our visionary\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan is not enough. We as\r\nMember nations must set about the task of societal re-\r\ncreation, within the parameters of our own societies, to\r\noffset the negative influence of moral degradation,\r\ncrime, drugs and anti-social behaviour. These are the\r\nbenchmarks of the uncivil society.\r\nIn the re-creation of our own societies we face the\r\nstructural disadvantages of unemployment, illiteracy\r\nand the tyranny of consumerism and materialism. Our\r\nyoung people are cannon-fodder for the blandishments\r\nof cable television. They lap up a culture and a lifestyle\r\nthat militate against their own self-development. They\r\nfail to understand the nexus between earning and\r\nspending and develop an appetite for consumer\r\ndurables which their economic base could never\r\nsupport. They become aggressively fired-up with\r\ndemands and rising expectations that neither the\r\nresources of the State nor their flimsy work ethic can\r\nentertain. They develop a culture of carping criticism\r\nthat leaves no space for a culture of appreciation.\r\nCaribbean Governments look on almost helplessly at a\r\ngrowing phenomenon that threatens to disturb the\r\nrhythm of projected economic growth and breeds a\r\nkind of lawlessness which conventional law-and-order\r\ntechniques cannot contain.\r\nAs globalization erodes the economic and social\r\nbases of our islands, international and bilateral aid\r\ndwindles. As ideologies and ideals give way to\r\npragmatism, the weak social and political fabric of\r\nthese fledgling nations is laid bare. The vocabulary of\r\ncontainment and patience can no longer hold back the\r\nanarchist tide of popular revolt. Small nations will\r\nencounter their own Seattles, with no National\r\nGuardsmen to come to the rescue, no sustaining\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nphilosophies to stem the tide, only the grim statistics of\r\nfalling revenues and rising expectations.\r\nNations which attempt to grapple with these\r\nsocial problems have incurred the wrath of large\r\ncountries, culminating in isolation and the imposition\r\nof sanctions. Countries like Cuba and Libya have felt\r\nthe crush of sanctions. The United Nations system must\r\nrethink the strategy of imposing sanctions and must\r\ndevise other means of ensuring compliance within the\r\ninternational community. The imposition of sanctions\r\nis often inhumane and is usually accompanied by\r\ndevastating economic consequences and fails to\r\nproduce the desired effect in targeted countries. The\r\ninternational community should realize that\r\ninterventions, embargoes and sanctions do not a\r\ndemocracy make.\r\nBecause of the untold suffering inflicted on\r\ncivilian populations, a twenty-first century United\r\nNations system cannot continue to endorse the\r\nimposition of sanctions. What is even more devastating\r\nis that the general will of this Assembly is often flouted\r\nand ignored when the international consensus calls for\r\na removal of sanctions. Is democracy merely a\r\nconvenient attitude? If so, it begs the question as to the\r\ninsistence that countries like Cuba should conform to\r\nthe principles of democracy when these principles\r\nthemselves are being compromised and rejected as a\r\nmatter of convenience. It is these injustices and\r\nviolations that have turned world opinion in favour of\r\nthe embattled Caribbean country Cuba and have made\r\nits leader Fidel Castro a living symbol of the\r\nunconquerable spirit of our people to triumph over\r\nadversity and incredible odds.\r\nMore than ever, the positives of a reformed\r\nUnited Nations will become a refuge, a bastion of hope\r\nfor nations nonplussed by events that seem suddenly\r\nout of their control. In my previous address to this\r\ntime-honoured institution, I alluded to the plight of\r\nAfrica. I should like to reiterate that as Africa was the\r\nlast impression of the twentieth century, poetic justice\r\ndemands that it must be our first preoccupation in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIn the process of re-creation, Saint Lucia and the\r\nCaribbean must strive to become a catalyst for peace in\r\nthe international forum. We must use our collective\r\ninfluence to contain the border disputes that threaten to\r\ncreate friction in Latin America and the Caribbean. We\r\nmust also be wary of importing conflicts into our\r\nregion.\r\nIn the case of Taiwan and China, it is vital that\r\nwe pursue the line of working towards a one-China\r\npolicy instead of fuelling the hostilities that\r\ncharacterize the existing relationship between these\r\ntwo countries. An early resolution of the impasse\r\nbetween Taiwan and China will strengthen the\r\nsolidarity of the developing world.\r\nIn the case of Africa, the Caribbean has always\r\nenjoyed a peculiarly symbiotic relationship with\r\nAfrica. Men like Padmore, C.L.R. James, Eric\r\nWilliams, Sir Arthur Lewis and Walter Rodney have all\r\nworked assiduously at the side of African leaders like\r\nNkrumah, Nyerere, Sékou Touré and Léopold Senghor\r\nin order to realize the ultimate dream of a united Africa\r\nliberated from the bondage of poverty, disease and\r\nexploitation. This noble tradition must continue. Once\r\nagain, Saint Lucia calls on its CARICOM colleagues to\r\npursue the possibility of obtaining observer status at\r\nthe Organisation of African Unity.\r\nThe peoples of the African continent face the\r\nonslaught of the AIDS pandemic that threatens to\r\ndecimate the population of the entire continent. But the\r\ndevastating effect of AIDS is felt not only on the\r\nAfrican continent. Today the world is confronted with\r\nthe greatest health crisis in human history. The effects\r\nof this disease can destabilize fragile democracies and\r\neconomic progress in both the developing and the\r\ndeveloped world.\r\nWe welcome President Clinton’s efforts to create\r\nan African AIDS Trust Fund and the pledge of one\r\nbillion US dollars to combat AIDS in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. We also welcome Cuba’s undertaking to send\r\nthree thousand Cuban doctors to Africa. However,\r\ngiven the transnational nature of the disease, the United\r\nNations should use its institutions to launch a\r\nmovement aimed at the complete eradication of this\r\nscourge. If the world is to survive the ravages of this\r\nplague, we must not only pledge financial resources\r\ntowards research and the development of\r\npharmaceuticals, but we must make those\r\npharmaceuticals affordable and accessible and also\r\ncontinue to sensitize the international community to\r\npreventive measures.\r\nAt year’s end, the General Assembly will witness\r\nthe end of the first International Decade for the\r\nEradication of Colonialism. Much remains to be done\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nbefore the United Nations is successful in carrying out\r\nits statutory mandate to ensure complete and absolute\r\npolitical equality for the peoples of the relevant\r\nterritories. This must remain the guiding principle of\r\nthe international community. That the majority of the\r\nremaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are small\r\nislands does not mean that the self-determination of\r\ntheir peoples is less important than for former\r\nterritories which achieved sovereign status. We must\r\nresist all attempts to legitimize the present unequal\r\ncolonial arrangements, which do not provide for full\r\nand absolute political equality. Saint Lucia therefore\r\nfully endorses the proclaiming of a second Decade for\r\nthe Eradication of Colonialism and calls on Member\r\nStates and United Nations organizations to fulfil their\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter and relevant General\r\nAssembly resolutions.\r\nOn the initiative of the Government of Canada, a\r\ndebate has started in the forum of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States on the subject of global human\r\nsecurity. It is comforting for developing States, and\r\nespecially small developing States, to feel that the\r\nconscience of the international world has been pricked\r\ninto focusing on the security of the entire globe — the\r\nentire globe. On a discordant note, the United States of\r\nAmerica is now concentrating its attention on a\r\nnational missile defence system aimed at protecting the\r\nUnited States from missile attacks. At this strategic\r\njuncture in the new millennium, when world leaders\r\nare gingerly nurturing a culture of peace and\r\ndisarmament, this action runs counter to the mood for\r\nreconciliation and universal nuclear disarmament. This\r\nunfortunate and myopic emphasis on the protection of\r\none nation and one people might well trigger a rash of\r\nself-protective nuclear explosions, effectively eroding\r\nthe fragile trust which underpins the hope for global\r\nhuman security.\r\nThere are no worlds to conquer, but worlds to\r\nrecreate. The recreation of the United Nations must be\r\nposited on the basis of mutual respect between rich and\r\npoor, mutual respect between large and small nations.\r\nAs small and desperate as our islands appear to be, we\r\nshould hold fast to the principles that inform the\r\noperations of the United Nations.\r\nWe challenge the paradigm shift which the\r\ndeveloped nations are cleverly manipulating to shunt\r\nthe focus of the United Nations towards peacekeeping\r\nand humanitarian assistance. Saint Lucia states clearly\r\nand unequivocally that the United Nations focus should\r\nzero in on development as a radical instrument for\r\neradicating poverty and war.\r\nNo $600 million carrot will tempt us to abandon\r\nthe principle of a nation’s capacity to pay. No Congress\r\nshould determine the scale of assessments for the\r\nUnited Nations, and there should be no conditionality\r\nfor paying arrears and meeting one’s obligations to this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe hungry sheep look up and are not fed. The\r\nwolves run amok and batten on their hunger, and the\r\ncycle goes on in its impropriety. This Organization\r\nmust not flinch in its millennial resolve to end the\r\ncarnage.\r\n“So I come to you from the weary battlefield of\r\ntime\r\nArmed with the disappointments of yesterday\r\nThe sufferings of today and the dreams of\r\ntomorrow\r\nIn the struggle I may die\r\nBut let’s not forsake another tomorrow”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency The Honourable Bonaya\r\nAdhi Godana, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of the Republic of Kenya.\r\nMr. Godana (Kenya): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating the President on behalf of my delegation\r\non his unanimous election to lead the fifty-fifth regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am confident that\r\nhis able leadership and vast diplomatic experience will\r\nsteer the business of this session of the General\r\nAssembly to the desired outcome. I also wish to\r\nexpress my delegation’s gratitude to his predecessor,\r\nMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, for the able\r\nmanner in which he presided over the work of our\r\nprevious session. I commend the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose commitment in shaping the\r\nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the new\r\nmillennium has won the respect and admiration of\r\nmany. I particularly commend him for his selfless\r\ndedication to duty and encourage him to continue\r\nserving the international community with the same\r\nzeal.\r\nThe proliferation of conflicts in Africa continues\r\nto pose serious threats to peace, security and stability.\r\nConflicts have had a negative impact on the continent’s\r\ndevelopment capacity and continue to undermine\r\nefforts to improve the living standards of our peoples.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nThey have caused considerable destruction and loss of\r\nlives, generated millions of refugees and displaced\r\npersons and exacerbated famine conditions in areas\r\nsuch as the southern Sudan and the Horn of Africa.\r\nAfrica recognizes the primary role of the United\r\nNations in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. It also recognizes the need for cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\r\nin peacekeeping and peace-building. Such efforts have\r\nyielded positive results in some countries. However,\r\nthere are others, such as the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, where the United Nations has been slow to\r\nact.\r\nPositive regional initiatives have been recorded in\r\nthe cessation of armed hostilities between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, under the auspices of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU). We commend the parties for the\r\nmaturity they have demonstrated. We urge both parties\r\nto the conflict to uphold the ceasefire while working\r\ntowards a final negotiated settlement of that dispute.\r\nThe United Nations is urged to speedily discharge its\r\nduty along that common border.\r\nThe establishment last month of a Transitional\r\nNational Assembly and the election of the President of\r\nthe Republic of Somalia was indeed a momentous\r\noccasion. I pay tribute to President Ismail Omar\r\nGuelleh of Djibouti for his mediation efforts and his\r\nsteadfast commitment to the cause of peace in Somalia.\r\nI call upon the international community to continue\r\nproviding support and humanitarian assistance to the\r\nSomali nation. I also hope that the recently concluded\r\naccord on Burundi will bring to an end the seven-year-\r\nold civil war and enable the people of that country to\r\nredirect their efforts towards reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe recent unfortunate experience in Sierra\r\nLeone calls for a review of peacekeeping operations,\r\nparticularly with regard to the safety, commissioning\r\nand deployment of troops. Kenya supports the recent\r\ninitiative aimed at curbing the trade in illicit diamonds,\r\nwhich fuels and sustains conflicts in Africa. Kenya\r\nwelcomes the decision by the Security Council\r\nauthorizing the establishment of an international\r\ncriminal court to try those responsible for atrocities\r\ncommitted in the civil war in Sierra Leone. It should\r\nsignal to the rebels there and elsewhere that the\r\ninternational community will not tolerate acts against\r\nhumanity.\r\nTurning to disarmament and international\r\nsecurity, we are disappointed that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament for the second year running has not\r\nundertaken any substantive work. This situation is\r\nparticularly disturbing, since the Conference is the sole\r\nmultilateral disarmament negotiating forum.\r\nThe Conference has for a considerable period of\r\ntime been expected to conduct serious negotiations on\r\na fissile material cut-off treaty and a treaty on nuclear\r\ndisarmament. This Assembly has in various resolutions\r\nurged the Conference on Disarmament to undertake\r\nsuch negotiations. During its fifty-fourth session, for\r\ninstance, the General Assembly passed four resolutions\r\nwhich, inter alia, called on the Conference to get down\r\nto serious work.\r\nThe lack of progress at the Conference is due to\r\nthe reluctance of key nuclear-weapon States to submit\r\nthemselves to negotiate in good faith, despite their\r\nobligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nWe still expect the nuclear-weapon States to honour\r\ntheir commitment to undertake genuine nuclear\r\ndisarmament, which they renewed during the 2000\r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty. Failure\r\nof the Conference on Disarmament will send the wrong\r\nsignal to non-nuclear-weapon States and might well\r\nencourage those with nuclear ambitions to join that\r\nclub. After the end of the cold war, there is no longer\r\nany justification for maintaining nuclear arsenals, if\r\nthere ever was one. Kenya calls on the nuclear\r\ncountries to preserve outer space as a nuclear-free\r\nzone.\r\nThe serious security problem posed by the\r\nproliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons is a\r\nmatter of grave concern to Kenya. We hosted in March\r\nthis year the Great Lakes Region and Horn of Africa\r\nConference on the proliferation of illicit small arms\r\nand light weapons. The Conference, attended by 10\r\nStates of the region, adopted the Nairobi Declaration,\r\nwhich calls for greater cooperation and information-\r\nsharing between law enforcement and border control\r\nofficials of States in our region, as well as the\r\nstrengthening and/or adoption of national laws and\r\ncontrol mechanisms governing civilian possession of\r\narms, and urges source countries to regulate weapons\r\nand arms transactions through strict licensing. The\r\nNairobi Conference was an important initiative. Kenya\r\nis in the process of organizing a follow-up meeting\r\nlater this year.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nIn the same vein, I should like to express our full\r\nsupport for the International Conference on the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects, scheduled for 2001. We hope that that\r\nConference will adequately address our concerns.\r\nA consequence of conflicts and the proliferation\r\nof illicit small arms and light weapons has been the\r\nmassive movement of refugees across borders. Kenya\r\ncontinues to host a large number of such refugees. This\r\nhas put a heavy strain on our own scarce national\r\nresources.\r\nI am happy to note that the Government of Kenya\r\nis in the process of finalizing the Refugee Bill 2000 in\r\norder to address the refugee phenomenon. The Bill is a\r\nresult of joint efforts between the Government of\r\nKenya, the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees and other stakeholders. It will provide\r\nrefugees with a better legal framework in which to live\r\nand exercise their rights. Kenya would like to see an\r\nend to the disparity in the treatment of refugees\r\nglobally. We have noted with concern the bewildering\r\ninconsistency in the responses to the refugee problems\r\nin other parts of the world compared with those in\r\nAfrica. We hope that in future the international\r\ncommunity will respond in a fair and consistent manner\r\nto refugee crises in all parts of the world.\r\nThe promotion of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms is firmly on the international agenda. In\r\nKenya the Government effort is geared towards\r\nenhancing public awareness of existing rights and\r\nfreedoms. In this regard, the Government has prepared\r\na bill seeking to establish an independent human rights\r\ncommission to monitor and protect human rights. That\r\ncommission would also advise the Government on its\r\ninternational obligations on the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights.\r\nDuring the last session of the Assembly I\r\ncommended the High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nfor adopting a proactive approach to human rights\r\nissues. We continue to stress that human rights should\r\nbe addressed in a global context through a dialogue-\r\nbased approach. In this way, we will realize wider\r\nacceptance and observance of human rights.\r\nThe rise in transnational networks of crime,\r\nnarcotics, money laundering and terrorism is another\r\nmatter of grave concern to us. The effects of the\r\nAugust 1998 terrorist bombing in Nairobi are still\r\nevident in our economy and in the lives of Kenyans.\r\nWe have undertaken measures to contain this menace\r\nby establishing special policing units and strict control\r\nof movement on border areas and other national entry\r\npoints. We are also collaborating with international\r\nsecurity agencies, such as Interpol, and have signed\r\nextradition treaties with a number of States. We call for\r\nconcerted efforts to adopt effective international\r\nmeasures to eradicate the growing and dangerous links\r\nbetween terrorist groups, drug traffickers and armed\r\ncriminal groups. The struggle against terrorism can\r\nonly succeed if there is cooperation between all\r\ncountries to track down and apprehend wanted\r\nterrorists.\r\nKenya supports the initiative to restructure and\r\nrevitalize the United Nations in the economic, social\r\nand related fields. We stress that the promotion of\r\ndevelopment should remain a central priority of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe process of reforming the Economic and\r\nSocial Council should be expedited by organizing its\r\nwork throughout the year and reinforcing its role in\r\nproviding overall policy guidance for operational\r\ndevelopment programmes and funds.\r\nKenya supports the implementation of policies\r\nthat foster economic growth in developing countries in\r\norder to bridge the widening gap between rich and\r\npoor. My delegation urges the United Nations and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions to ensure the facilitation of\r\nstronger and more equitable international multilateral\r\ndevelopment cooperation designed to address the\r\ngrowing problems in economic development.\r\nWe are all aware of the challenging task of\r\neradicating poverty consistent with the overall\r\nobjectives and strategies agreed in the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action adopted at\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development and with the\r\noutcome of the Millennium Summit. Kenya supports\r\nand continues to implement the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action. This\r\ncommitment is manifested in our Government’s\r\ndetermination to establish a firm policy and\r\ninstitutional framework for mainstreaming the poverty\r\neradication agenda. The formulation of the National\r\nPoverty Eradication Plan is a step towards focusing\r\nnational policies and operational priorities on the poor,\r\nas well as providing an enabling environment for them\r\nto participate in economic and social development.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nFurther, the Government of Kenya has developed\r\nan interim poverty reduction strategy paper, which has\r\nbeen prepared in consultation with all stakeholders.\r\nThe strategy paper outlines measures designed to\r\nimprove economic performance, while identifying key\r\nactions to reduce the prevalence of poverty.\r\nThe above measures are part of the Kenya\r\nGovernment’s strategy to restore economic growth\r\nwhile maintaining economic stability. Economic\r\nreforms are gaining momentum and are expected to\r\nlead to a progressive increase in real per capita growth.\r\nCurrently, the country is facing a severe drought, the\r\nworst in our country’s history. This is having a\r\ndebilitating effect on our economy. We appreciate the\r\nassistance received so far from the international\r\ncommunity and seek continued support to deal with the\r\nsituation.\r\nGlobalization poses enormous challenges to\r\ndeveloping countries, and ours is no exception. Kenya\r\nwelcomes initiatives that protect the weaker States\r\nfrom the adverse effects of globalization. The ability of\r\nAfrican countries to participate effectively, exercise\r\ntheir rights and meet their obligations in the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) is an important determinant\r\nin their integration into the international trading\r\nsystem. My delegation is concerned about the growing\r\nprotectionism manifested in attempts to support a new\r\nround of multilateral trade negotiations within the\r\ncontext of the WTO. Kenya is firmly opposed to the\r\nintroduction of new protectionist barriers to trade\r\ncamouflaged as labour, health and environmental\r\nstandards.\r\nAt the same time, we urge the implementation of\r\nspecial and differential provisions in respect of\r\ndeveloping and least developed countries because of\r\ntheir low levels of industrialization and the vulnerable\r\nnature of their economies.\r\nThe increased globalization of financial markets\r\nand capital flows poses new challenges for the\r\nmobilization of adequate resources. Kenya shares the\r\nconcerns of developing countries over the general\r\ndecline in official development assistance and the free\r\nflow of foreign direct investment to developing\r\ncountries. Portfolio investment, which tends to be\r\nvolatile and unpredictable, as experienced during the\r\n1997 financial crisis, is a source of financial instability.\r\nWe support the creation of a new international financial\r\narchitecture for a more stable financial system. The\r\nglobal market environment poses enormous challenges,\r\nand there is an urgent need for supportive international\r\npolicies that will ensure the financial system’s efficient\r\nfunctioning.\r\nThe slow progress in Africa’s attainment of\r\nsustainable economic growth is linked to the failure to\r\nmobilize resources. This has been aggravated by\r\ninternal conflicts and the prevalence of diseases such as\r\nmalaria and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which in\r\nthemselves have a causal relationship with poverty and\r\ndeprivation. My country, in collaboration with\r\ninternational agencies, is zealously pursuing scientific\r\nresearch to find a cure for malaria and the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. We call upon the international community to\r\nsupport our research efforts to find a cure for these\r\ndiseases, which continue to ravage millions. Kenya\r\nwishes to stress the need to ensure the easy availability\r\nof existing drugs to those already afflicted.\r\nGiven that information technologies are important\r\nprerequisites for development, the developed countries\r\nshould direct resources to accelerate the development\r\nof information technology in Africa. In this regard,\r\nKenya welcomes the Okinawa Charter initiative of the\r\nG-8 countries and looks forward to the implementation\r\nof its aims.\r\nMy delegation notes the commitment made by the\r\nG-8 to speed up the pace of implementation of the\r\nenhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative, in line with the targets agreed at the Cologne\r\nSummit. However, the initiative suffers from a lack of\r\ncommitment to implementation and should be reviewed\r\nwith a view to being speeded up. We share the\r\nconcerns, expressed by the leaders from developing\r\ncountries who attended the Okinawa G-8 Summit, on\r\nthe impact of the debt burden to poverty alleviation\r\nefforts. Debt repayment in sub-Saharan Africa is to the\r\ndetriment of health, education and other essential\r\nservices. Kenya urges creditor countries to honour\r\npledges for debt relief and increase balance of payment\r\nsupport to developing countries.\r\nKenya attaches special importance to South-\r\nSouth cooperation. It is in recognition of the important\r\nrole of economic cooperation among developing\r\ncountries that we continue actively to pursue economic\r\nintegration with countries in our own subregion. The\r\nrelationship between regional and subregional\r\neconomic groupings is seen within the framework of\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nthe African Economic Community, which Kenya fully\r\nsupports.\r\nThe institutions established in 1945 are overdue\r\nfor an overhaul. The world political, economic and\r\nsecurity landscape has changed, and so must these\r\ninstitutions. The United Nations must become a truly\r\nuniversal Organization, democratic and representative\r\nof the many diverse interests. Its organs should reflect\r\nthis rich diversity, with effective representation and\r\nparticipation at all levels of decision-making. The\r\nGeneral Assembly has to reassert its role within the\r\nOrganization. The Security Council must also reflect\r\nthe principle of equitable geographical representation\r\nand the realities of our times. Kenya seeks to have\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council allotted for\r\nAfrica, to be filled by African countries on a rotational\r\nbasis and on the same footing as existing permanent\r\nseats. The transformation of institutions dealing with\r\nother issues is equally overdue if we are to re-energize\r\nthe efficacy and effectiveness of the United Nations, as\r\ncalled for in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nKenya appreciates the increased utilization of the\r\nUnited Nations Office at Nairobi. We are nevertheless\r\ndissatisfied with the level of involvement with\r\nenvironment and human settlement issues. There is a\r\nhuge, under-utilized capacity in the Nairobi offices. It\r\nshould be noted also that the Nairobi Declaration\r\nadopted by Member States in February 1997 declared\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\r\nto be the principal body in the field of environment.\r\nKenya is therefore totally opposed to the creation of\r\nnew institutions with similar concerns and calls upon\r\nthe international community to strengthen the role of\r\nUNEP and the United Nations Centre for Human\r\nSettlements (Habitat) in Nairobi.\r\nIn conclusion, Kenya fully embraces the spirit of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, with a pledge to make its\r\nmodest contribution in the general service of a happier\r\nfamily of nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is Her Excellency Mrs. Benita Ferrero-\r\nWaldner, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAustria.\r\nMrs. Ferrero-Waldner (Austria): First of all, let\r\nme say how satisfied I am about this week’s decision of\r\nour 14 European Union (EU) partners to lift the\r\nmeasures implemented on 31 January against Austria.\r\nThis is a victory for reason, and it is also a victory for\r\nEurope. In the last seven and a half months — a very\r\ndifficult time, I must say — the United Nations has\r\nstood by us. Austria treasures this support. The United\r\nNations has had confidence in our firm commitment to\r\nuniversal standards and values. The report of the “three\r\nwise men”, Martti Ahtisaari, Marcelino Oreja and\r\nJochen Frowein, comes to the same conclusion. Austria\r\nwill continue its role as an active, reliable and\r\nconstructive Member State of the United Nations.\r\nAustria expects to resume fully its formal and\r\ninformal work within the European Union. This is\r\nabsolutely crucial in view of the important projects that\r\nlie ahead of us: first, the reform of the institutions of\r\nthe European Union and, secondly, the enlargement of\r\nthe Union, a matter of great importance and a historic\r\nresponsibility. An enlarged Union will bolster\r\nEuropean stability and prosperity. Its benefits will\r\nreach beyond Europe. Austria, as a country in the heart\r\nof Europe, will fully support and, in its own interest,\r\naccelerate the process of enlargement.\r\nSince this fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly coincides with the turn of the millennium,\r\nwe ought to undertake a broader examination of today’s\r\nworld. We ought to design policies of a long-term\r\nnature. All too often we have to cope with\r\ncontradictions when engaging in day-to-day politics\r\nand when rapidly responding to crises on the one hand\r\nand addressing sustainable societal development on the\r\nother. A great number of our decisions taken today\r\nhave important implications for future policy options.\r\nGenerations to come will have to bear the cost, and\r\nthey will enjoy the benefits of our policies.\r\nIt is in this context that I wish to pay tribute to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\nclairvoyance and leadership. His millennium report\r\nembraces a balanced analysis of the challenges the\r\ninternational community faces today, and it offers\r\nconcrete, accomplishable and far-sighted\r\nrecommendations. Austria welcomes this road map for\r\nthe future course of United Nations activities and will\r\nfollow its guidelines.\r\nFurthermore, Austria supports the timely\r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General to mandate a\r\ncomprehensive review of peacekeeping operations in\r\nall their aspects. Since the environment for complex\r\npeace operations has become more challenging than\r\never before, Austria, as a major troop contributor,\r\nwelcomes the report and the recommendations drawn\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nup by a group of experts under the leadership of\r\nMr. Brahimi. We are ready to support their\r\nimplementation.\r\nAs Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I wish to\r\noutline a number of major achievements of the OSCE\r\nduring this year. The OSCE serves as the primary\r\nforum for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis\r\nmanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation in my\r\nregion. This year we are celebrating the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the Helsinki Final Act. This truly\r\nhistoric document initiated the Helsinki Process, from\r\nwhich we still draw valid lessons for our common\r\nefforts to achieve “freedom from fear”, to use this vivid\r\nnotion from the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/54/2000, para. 65). Security and stability through\r\ncooperation and the effective protection of human\r\nrights within each country have a direct bearing on\r\ninternational peace and security. The fundamental\r\nsignificance of democracy, human rights and strong\r\ncivil societies has been affirmed in the Charter on\r\nEuropean Security adopted by the OSCE participating\r\nStates last year in Istanbul.\r\nThe OSCE has proved to be a flexible institution,\r\nadapting itself to the far-reaching changes in the\r\npolitical landscape of Europe after the fall of the Iron\r\nCurtain. Over the past decade, it has evolved into a\r\nvibrant organization with a network of as many as 20\r\nfield operations.\r\nNot only in South-Eastern Europe and Central\r\nAsia, on which I will elaborate later, but also in other\r\nparts of the OSCE area, we have been able to achieve\r\nconcrete results in our continuing efforts for peace and\r\nstability. As to conflict prevention, I would like to\r\nmention the successful observation mission of the\r\nOSCE at the border between Georgia and the Chechen\r\nRepublic of the Russian Federation. We can also\r\nregister some positive developments concerning the\r\npolitical resolution of “frozen conflicts” in Georgia and\r\nin Moldova — conflicts which are often outside the\r\nspotlight of broader public attention but nevertheless\r\nhave a highly destabilizing impact on the region and\r\nbeyond. Through my frequent travels as Chairperson-\r\nin-Office, I wish to enhance the political awareness\r\nregarding these unresolved or potential conflicts and\r\nsecurity risks. The conflict situation in Chechnya\r\nremains unresolved and a matter of great concern.\r\nLet me mention an achievement in the\r\ninstitutional field. An important step in enhancing the\r\ncivilian crisis management capability of the OSCE was\r\nset with the establishment of the Rapid Expert\r\nAssistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT), a\r\nprogramme which should speed up the deployment of\r\nhighly trained civilian experts to the field.\r\nWhat are the specific challenges the OSCE is\r\ncurrently facing in the prevention, settlement and\r\nmanagement of conflicts? In South-Eastern Europe the\r\nwork of the Organization focuses in particular on the\r\nstrengthening of democracy, post-crisis rehabilitation,\r\nthe rule of law and civil society. The promotion of free\r\nand fair elections plays a key role in achieving these\r\ngoals. The OSCE is tasked with organizing local\r\nelections in Kosovo at the end of October this year and,\r\nonly two weeks thereafter, of general elections in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. In Kosovo, the OSCE has\r\nbeen involved in the complex task of civil and voter\r\nregistration, which resulted in more than 1 million\r\nregistrations. I note with regret that the Kosovo Serbs\r\ndid not participate in the registration process and that\r\nBelgrade would not allow the registration of Kosovo\r\nSerbs in Serbia. The OSCE, however, will continue its\r\nefforts to bring about active participation of the\r\nKosovo Serbs in democratic political life. We will not\r\nlose sight of our common goal of a pluri-ethnic\r\nKosovo.\r\nKosovo is an excellent example of the new\r\nquality of the cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the OSCE as a distinct component within the\r\noverall framework of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration.\r\nA central goal of Austria’s chairmanship of the\r\nOSCE is to give equal attention to current, and often\r\nlong-standing, conflicts as well as to potential security\r\nrisks. In the pursuit of this policy, we support the\r\nexplicit goal of the OSCE to create a common security\r\nspace. This implies a strong focus on the Caucasus\r\nregion and on Central Asia. The OSCE effectively\r\ncontributes to the alleviation of the suffering of the\r\ncivilian population in this region, the promotion of\r\npolitical dialogue between warring parties and the\r\nmonitoring of post-conflict arrangements through\r\nobserver missions.\r\nConflict prevention is key to the work of the\r\nOSCE in Central Asia. During my most recent visit to\r\nthe region, I obtained a first-hand impression of its\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nsecurity problems. In addition to the destabilizing\r\neffects of the precarious situation in Afghanistan, the\r\nCentral Asian region faces manifold transnational\r\nthreats, such as terrorism, organized crime, illegal arms\r\nand drug trafficking and the degradation of the\r\nenvironment, as well as violent extremism and\r\nreligious fundamentalism.\r\nThe OSCE is well placed to support the Central\r\nAsian States in their common efforts to deal effectively\r\nwith these multiple challenges to their security. It acts\r\nas a political catalyst supporting the efforts of other,\r\nspecialized international actors. The international\r\nconference, jointly prepared by the OSCE\r\nChairmanship and the United Nations Office for Drug\r\nControl and Crime Prevention, on the issues of drugs,\r\norganized crime and terrorism, to be held in Tashkent\r\non 19 and 20 October is only one example.\r\nI cannot but re-emphasize the importance of the\r\nhuman dimension in the work of the OSCE. In the\r\ncourse of this year we have focused our work on a\r\nnumber of abhorrent facets of civil unrest, such as\r\nchildren in armed conflict, the proliferation of small\r\narms and the trafficking in human beings, particularly\r\nwomen and girls. It is in this context that I would like\r\nto highlight the recent adoption of a comprehensive\r\nAction Plan for Gender Issues, which will guide the\r\nOSCE in its commitment to advance equality between\r\nwomen and men and to protect the human rights of\r\nwomen and girls in the region.\r\nIf we analyse the profound changes that have\r\noccurred in the recent past, we note that the individual\r\ncitizen has gained in prominence not only as an actor in\r\nour democratic societies, with growing responsibilities\r\nin relation to the social, environmental and economic\r\nsustainability of our development, but as a victim of\r\nnew threats to security.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the United Nations, the\r\nGroup of Eight and the OSCE have increasingly moved\r\naction against terrorism, drug abuse and crime to the\r\ntop of their agendas. I am pleased to point out that the\r\nnegotiations on a Convention against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime, which were held at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters in Vienna over the past two years, led to\r\na successful outcome in the course of this summer. We\r\nare confident that the three additional protocols — on\r\ntrafficking in and smuggling of persons as well as on\r\ntrafficking in firearms — will be concluded this fall.\r\nAustria, in any case, will strive for a rapid entry into\r\nforce and implementation of these important legal\r\ninstruments. We are pleased that the United Nations\r\nCentre for International Crime Prevention will serve as\r\nthe secretariat for the Conference of the Parties. I stress\r\nthat my country is ready to join forces with our\r\npartners in the developing world to counter organized\r\ncrime in all its facets.\r\nThanks to the human development reports of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), our\r\nunderstanding of development has shifted from macro-\r\neconomic statistics to a more human-centred concept,\r\ndefining development as a process of broadening the\r\nspectrum of choice, both of the individual human being\r\nand of society at large. I am pleased that the Human\r\nDevelopment Report 2000 underlines the\r\ninterrelatedness between human development and\r\nhuman rights. In short, the Report concludes that\r\nhuman development is an essential precondition for the\r\nrealization of human rights. Human rights, in turn, are\r\nan essential prerequisite for comprehensive human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIf, however, we accept that most challenges to\r\nhuman security have a human rights dimension, we\r\nmay wish to take a new and more operational look at\r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. How can\r\nwe make our human rights regimes more effective in\r\nour societies? The Secretary-General has shown us the\r\npath to follow, saying:\r\n“it is the poison of ignorance, all too frequently,\r\nthat lies at the heart of human rights violations,\r\nknowledge provides an antidote”. (Press release\r\nSG/SM/6829, 10 December 1998)\r\nUltimately, it will be citizens themselves who, through\r\nbetter knowledge, become the owners of their human\r\nrights.\r\nIt is in this context that I would like to point out\r\nthe initiative taken by all women Ministers for Foreign\r\nAffairs present at the opening of the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the General Assembly. We jointly launched an\r\nappeal to our fellow leaders in order to energize our\r\ncommon fight against the global scourge of HIV/AIDS,\r\na scourge which increasingly affects women and girls.\r\nOur efforts to counter the HIV/AIDS pandemic must be\r\nmultifaceted. They must encompass access to adequate\r\nmedical care, drugs and social protection; they must\r\nencompass information and services available to girls\r\nand women to help them understand their sexual and\r\nreproductive rights in order to protect themselves from\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nunwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases, including HIV/AIDS. This should be\r\ncombined with the education of young men to respect\r\nwomen’s self-determination and to share responsibility\r\nwith women in matters of health, sexuality and\r\nreproduction.\r\nThe United Nations Decade for Human Rights\r\nEducation, spanning the period 1995-2005, was\r\nunanimously adopted by this Assembly at its forty-\r\nninth session. We have reached its mid-term and might\r\ntherefore wish to give it new momentum. We clearly\r\ncame to understand that human rights education and\r\nlearning serve as strategies for development on the one\r\nhand and as preventive tools for human security on the\r\nother.\r\nFollowing an initiative taken by Austria in the\r\nframework of the “Human Security Network” of\r\nForeign Ministers, an International Workshop on\r\nHuman Security and Human Rights Education was\r\nconvened in Graz, Austria, early this year. Experts\r\nfrom all continents called for human rights education\r\nand learning as a common endeavour of governmental,\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental institutions.\r\nThey concluded that human rights education should go\r\nbeyond formal education so as to encompass all forms\r\nof learning and different modes of socialization.\r\nInnovative human rights education must be\r\nparticipatory and operational, creative and\r\nempowering. It must address all levels of society. All\r\ncitizens, in particular all persons in positions of\r\nleadership, must regard human rights standards as a\r\nyardstick when making decisions.\r\nIn this context, I applaud the initiatives taken in\r\nAfrica, South Asia, Latin America and Europe to have\r\nmunicipalities proclaim themselves “Human Rights\r\nCities”. I am pleased to announce from this rostrum\r\nthat the city of Graz will be the first “Human Rights\r\nCity” in Europe.\r\nWhile we affirm the universality of our human\r\nrights, human rights education and learning will have\r\nto be rooted in the rich cultural plurality of the world.\r\nIn the diversity of learning processes we will better\r\ncomprehend the common humanity we all share.\r\nWhy, it will be asked, do I raise the issue of\r\nhuman rights education and learning at the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations? It is because I am\r\nconvinced that in this strategic triangle with human\r\nsecurity and human development, human rights are of\r\nprofoundly political significance for the direction we\r\ntake in our development.\r\nAs the acquisition of any political culture takes\r\ntime, our efforts must be long-term and comprehensive.\r\nAt the same time, there is a sense of urgency. This is\r\nwhy I appeal to the Assembly to give our efforts in this\r\narea a new momentum and new energy and direction.\r\nLately civil society has pleaded for more political\r\nleadership in this field. We should be ready to respond\r\nand to develop new structures of partnership with civil\r\nsociety and with the institutions already active in the\r\nfield at national, regional and international levels.\r\nThe global house of human rights must be built\r\nevery day. It must be built by everyone and it must be\r\nowned by everyone. Only then will it be a house of\r\nprosperity, a house of freedom and a house of peace.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Ural Latypov,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Belarus.\r\nMr. Latypov (Belarus): Let me first welcome\r\nTuvalu as a new Member of the United Nations.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is\r\nan important landmark for the international community.\r\nWe are still feeling the beat of the Millennium Summit.\r\nOur crucial task now is to seek specific ways to\r\nimplement the provisions of its final Declaration.\r\nIn his address to the Summit, President\r\nAlyaksandr Lukashenka of Belarus clearly defined an\r\nultimate objective, as we see it, for shaping the image\r\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century, which\r\nis to meet the needs and aspirations of our respective\r\nnations and seek practical opportunities for real\r\nimprovement of the quality of life of every single\r\nindividual. This is the imperative that reality has been\r\ndictating to us. It is also the main thrust of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/54/2000) “We, the\r\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century”.\r\nBelarus holds in high respect the unique historic\r\nrole played by the United Nations in international\r\ndevelopments of the second half of the twentieth\r\ncentury. As can be seen from all the Organization’s\r\nprevious experience, a stable, just and prosperous\r\nworld can only be attained on the basis of the sovereign\r\nequality of States, their territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence, non-interference in their internal affairs\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nand respect for national traditions. Humanity has had to\r\nconfront conflict and humanitarian stress every time\r\nthose principles were disregarded. We believe that they\r\nwill continue to be of similar importance in the next\r\ncentury.\r\nJust as was the case 55 years ago, there is hardly\r\na more pressing task for the United Nations than the\r\nmaintenance of international peace. All Member States\r\nhave equal rights to peaceful and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Thus the security of no State, whether\r\nsmall island country or super-Power, can be achieved\r\nthrough disrespect for the interests of others.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus is committed to its\r\nchoice of a nuclear-weapon-free world. We believe in\r\nthe generosity and great meaning of the initiative by\r\nthe head of our State to establish a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nspace in Central and Eastern Europe. We are confident\r\nthat in due time this idea will receive a sufficient\r\nnumber of proponents.\r\nDuring this session Belarus has deposited its\r\ninstruments for ratification of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the additional Protocol to\r\nthe Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the\r\nProtocol on Blinding Laser Weapons. At the same time,\r\na continuing absence of visible consensus within the\r\nUnited Nations on the key issues of the international\r\ndisarmament process is becoming a dismaying reality.\r\nTo exit this dead end would essentially require setting\r\npriorities and embarking upon an active dialogue aimed\r\nat achieving progress in both nuclear and conventional\r\ndisarmament. Five million victims over the past\r\ndecade — is this not serious enough to make real\r\naction imperative?\r\nIt is crucial to maintain and consolidate the\r\nstrategic global parity built under the complex\r\nconditions of the twentieth century. In this regard,\r\npreservation of and respect for the Anti-Ballistic\r\nMissile (ABM) Treaty is a logical basis for the\r\nmaintenance of international stability. Its violation\r\ncould result in an extremely dangerous disruption of\r\nthe established set of interdependent agreements in this\r\narea. The Republic of Belarus will again sponsor the\r\nresolution on the ABM Treaty during this session.\r\nThe time-span between the two most recent\r\nsessions of the General Assembly has been marked by\r\nthe United Nations active involvement in the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, post-conflict peace-building and\r\nrehabilitation. We observe with satisfaction the actions\r\ntaken by the Security Council, more resolutely and\r\nconsistently than in the past, with respect to such\r\ncomplex situations as conflicts in Sierra Leone, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, Angola and East Timor. My country has been\r\nfollowing with hope the developments in the Middle\r\nEast. We believe that the withdrawal of Israeli troops\r\nfrom Southern Lebanon and the Palestinian-Israeli\r\npeace talks will favour the resolution of the crisis in the\r\nregion.\r\nFor over a quarter of a century attempts have\r\nbeen made to break a stalemate in the settlement of the\r\nCyprus problem. It is crucial that the United Nations\r\ncontinue its work to resolve this crisis on the basis of\r\nthe appropriate resolutions of the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe development of specific preventive measures\r\nfor the elimination of root causes of potential conflicts\r\nshould be the focus of United Nations attention in the\r\nnear future. It is important to make irreversible the\r\ngrowing trend in international efforts to define\r\nuniversal mechanisms and specify practical measures\r\nof conflict prevention and crisis management. The\r\nactivities of the Panel of experts headed by\r\nAmbassador Brahimi, in addition to the upcoming\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, are an important\r\ncontribution thereto.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has rightly observed,\r\nthe very credibility of the Organization as regards\r\nplaying a decisive role in the war and peace process is\r\nat stake. In this respect, the Republic of Belarus has\r\nbeen and remains firmly committed to the preservation\r\nof the primary role played by the Security Council in\r\ndecision-making on actions to avert threats to peace\r\nand security. Viewed from that perspective, further\r\nimprovement in the working methods of the Council\r\nand reform of its membership on the basis of equitable\r\ngeographic representation are not merely an important\r\ntask, but a pressing imperative.\r\nBelarus reconfirms its determination to\r\nconstructively contribute to the activities of the\r\nCouncil should my country be elected as a non-\r\npermanent member for the period 2002-2003.\r\nThe tremendous benefits of globalization will be\r\nreduced to nothing unless there is a clear understanding\r\nof the dire need for the international community to\r\nlearn a common language — that is, the language of\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nlaw. In recent years we have witnessed practical\r\ndemonstrations of situations in which even the slightest\r\ndeviation from internationally accepted norms would\r\ninevitably present an extreme danger not only for the\r\nviolators themselves, but also for the entire\r\ninternational community. It is an encouraging fact that\r\nsince its outset the United Nations has gained\r\nsignificant potential by accumulating all the far-\r\nreaching ideas, hopes and aspirations of humankind for\r\nbuilding a better world.\r\nImplementing the norms of international law at\r\nthe national level should become a priority for the\r\nUnited Nations and its partners. Today my country is a\r\nparty to the United Nations most important conventions\r\nand treaties. The establishment of a legislative model\r\nbased on the United Nations Charter and international\r\ntreaties and conventions, complemented by national\r\nlegislation, is the objective we must all strive for.\r\nThe stability of the interdependent world is\r\nhardly attainable when the system of international\r\npolitics is perceived solely as the domination of one\r\nState or interaction among separate groups of States.\r\nDifferences in social and economic advancement will\r\npersist for a long time. Therefore, in a globalizing\r\nworld the United Nations should play a more active\r\nrole in promoting the economic development and social\r\nprogress of all countries.\r\nBelarus supports a sharper focus in international\r\nefforts on the problems of the developing countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa. We also deem it expedient to\r\ntake into account the needs of countries with\r\neconomies in transition, which would by no means\r\nsoften the focus on the problems of the developing\r\nworld. We see no contradiction in such an interlinkage,\r\nas appropriate goals and objectives to this end could\r\nonly be formulated jointly with the United Nations.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus shares the apprehensions\r\nexpressed by many States over the environmental\r\nfuture of our planet. In this regard, we perceive as\r\nhighly indicative the debates at the Millennium Summit\r\nand at the Summit meeting of the Security Council.\r\nBelarus has signed and ratified a number of important\r\ninternational agreements in the area of environmental\r\nprotection, including the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity.\r\nAgainst this background, we continue to be\r\nacutely sensitive to the ever-diminishing interest by the\r\ninternational community in the Chernobyl disaster, the\r\nworld’s largest technological catastrophe of the past\r\ncentury, to which Belarus fell a major victim. In this\r\nregard, I should like to quote once more from the\r\naddress by the President of our country at the\r\nMillennium Summit:\r\n“Without awareness of our joint responsibility for\r\npreserving the common human environment, all\r\ndiscussions of a fair distribution of the benefits\r\nand disadvantages of globalization will remain\r\njust shallow talk.” (A/55/PV.4)\r\nWe are confident that the United Nations, which has so\r\nfar contributed significantly to assisting our people in\r\nthe relevant area, will be in a position to find new\r\nsources and mechanisms to help Belarus overcome the\r\nChernobyl tragedy.\r\nThe ideas of democracy and respect for human\r\nrights can certainly play a key role in continuous\r\nhuman development in the twenty-first century. Yet to\r\nmake this goal attainable, it is essential to relinquish\r\nattempts to use those principles to discriminate among\r\npeoples and “punish” unwelcome States and\r\nGovernments. Regrettably, we must note a certain\r\ninvolvement by the United Nations in efforts to\r\nestablish a “club of countries of advanced democracy”\r\non the basis of some random criteria. It is inadmissible\r\nthat the idea of the forum of new and restored\r\ndemocracies approved within our Organization should\r\nlead to the separation of peoples into teachers and\r\npupils.\r\nThe principle standpoint of Belarus on this issue\r\nis the following: a truly democratic world can only be\r\nbased on an equal dialogue among different\r\ncivilizations.\r\nThis year is of special significance to the\r\ndevelopment of democracy in my country.\r\nParliamentary elections due in October will be held in\r\nfull conformity with democratic standards. We have\r\ninvited international observers to monitor the elections\r\nand look forward to seeing them carried out and\r\ncontributing in real terms to democratic development in\r\nBelarus.\r\nEach session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly is a milestone in the evolution of the United\r\nNations itself and the development of the system of\r\ninternational politics as a whole. In that sense, the\r\ncurrent session has been endowed with very special\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\npowers. It is up to us all to determine how much the\r\nUnited Nations will be able to show that the hopes and\r\naspirations of our nations at the dawn of the new\r\ncentury were justified. In the discharge of these noble\r\nduties, the international community can invariably\r\ncount on a due contribution by the Republic of Belarus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Juan Esteban\r\nAguirre Martínez, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nParaguay.\r\nMr. Aguirre Martínez (Paraguay) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Before I begin, I should like to make a\r\npersonal comment. As a former official of the United\r\nNations Population Fund, I should like to express my\r\ngreat pride and personal satisfaction at being able to\r\nspeak to the Assembly today and to address those\r\ncountries with which I have worked, together with my\r\nother colleagues in the United Nations. All of us, of\r\ncourse, share a hope that our dream of a better world\r\nwill come true.\r\nIt is a great source of satisfaction to see the\r\nPresident preside over the work of this Assembly,\r\nfamiliar as I am with his great personal and\r\nprofessional skills, which guarantee the success of our\r\nwork. I should also like to express to his predecessor,\r\nMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab, our gratitude and\r\nrecognition of the efficient work he has done.\r\nSimilarly, I would like to thank the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the detailed report on the work of\r\nthe Organization that he has presented. It describes the\r\nimportant work carried out by the United Nations over\r\nthe past year as well as the challenges for the future.\r\nI should also like to express on behalf of my\r\nGovernment our pleasure at the entry of Tuvalu as a\r\nnew Member of our Organization. This is an important\r\nstep forward along the road of universality, which is\r\nthe aspiration we all share.\r\nThe recently concluded Millennium Summit was\r\na useful instrument for reflection by our Heads of State\r\nupon the present and future of the Organization. This\r\nOrganization must adapt its structures and mechanisms\r\nfor action to the new challenges facing humanity. I am\r\ncertain that the numerous suggestions that have been\r\nmade will help establish clear lines of action so the\r\nUnited Nations can operate more efficiently and\r\neffectively.\r\nAt the last summit of the Rio Group, which took\r\nplace in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, the Heads of\r\nState who comprise this political consultation\r\nmechanism endorsed the Cartagena Declaration as our\r\nsingular contribution to the Millennium Summit and to\r\nthe future of the United Nations. It is our intention to\r\nensure appropriate follow-up to the initiatives and\r\naspirations expressed in this document in order to make\r\ncertain that they become a reality in the future for the\r\nbenefit of all humanity in terms of democracy, trade\r\nflows, better dynamics in international relations in\r\nterms of human security and the pursuit of multilateral\r\nsolutions.\r\nI fully agree with the Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization when he says that the conclusion of one\r\ncentury and the turn of the millennium provide us with\r\na unique vantage point for reflecting upon our common\r\ndestiny. Fifty-five years have passed since the creation\r\nof the United Nations, and during that period we have\r\nseen many auspicious as well as many worrying events.\r\nLet us pause for a moment and think about all the good\r\nthat we have done and the good that we have failed to\r\ndo, as well as upon what we have done wrong or\r\nshould not have done.\r\nThe conclusion of the cold war, of which this\r\nOrganization was one of the most important theatres,\r\nseemed to herald a period of peace and prosperity for\r\nhumanity, in fulfilment of the Biblical mandate to beat\r\nour swords into plowshares. Nevertheless, humanity is\r\nstill facing terrible threats, not only to its security —\r\nbecause war and violence persist in new and more\r\nsophisticated forms — but also threats to its very\r\nexistence, in light of the prospect that our planet may\r\nbecome uninhabitable as a result of human activities.\r\nConsequently, in the new millennium the United\r\nNations will be equally if not more important than it\r\nwas in the previous millennium. Our Organization must\r\nof course adapt to new times. The reform of our\r\nOrganization cannot be postponed any further. The\r\nstructures of its main organs must adapt to the new\r\ncharacteristics of the international community, with the\r\nincreasing number of nations which belong to it. We\r\nmust adapt to the increasing role of civil society, the\r\nspread of the system of representative democracy, the\r\nglobalization of our world markets and the intolerable\r\npersistence of serious social deficits in most of our\r\nStates.\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nIn particular, our Organization must adapt so that\r\nour efforts towards development are rendered\r\nappropriate for each individual wherever he or she may\r\nlive and wherever his or her community may be\r\nlocated, and wherever we want to see our families\r\ngrow.\r\nThe human being as the centre of development\r\nwill continue to be at the centre of our mandate, as well\r\nas the commitments assumed by each and every one of\r\nour countries at summits of the United Nations over the\r\npast decade. The efforts made by each man, woman or\r\nchild to take advantage of the opportunities offered by\r\nglobal markets and new economic trends is first and\r\nforemost a local and community effort and secondly a\r\nnational effort, which can create opportunities for\r\ngrowth and ensure participation for each man and each\r\nwoman.\r\nThe reorganization of the United Nations, and in\r\nparticular its system of development, must ensure that\r\nit can respond creatively and flexibly to these\r\ncommunity and national efforts. This will make it\r\npossible progressively to improve for each individual\r\ndaily access to health, education, sanitation services,\r\ntechnology and reasonable credit, as well as the\r\nequitable participation of women in productive\r\nactivities. In that way, we can ensure the integration of\r\nall our citizens into the global market and make certain\r\nthey can benefit from this process.\r\nIt is vital that the cooperation activities of the\r\nUnited Nations be well structured and have a real\r\nimpact on our populations, in particular women,\r\nchildren and adolescents. It is essential that these\r\nactivities create an environment of national dialogue in\r\neach of our countries with a view to harmonizing views\r\non development and creating consensus on the means\r\nfor achieving growth, in order to give true meaning to\r\nsocial and productive investments and to meet the\r\nqualitative demands of civil society.\r\nNational consensus must necessarily be the basis\r\nfor global consensus, and today more than ever it must\r\nbe the basis for consensus among integrated groups\r\nthat wish to negotiate with each other. However, a\r\nreorganized and renewed United Nations, in the\r\nultimate analysis, must be the guarantor of the\r\nwell-being of each of our citizens. The United Nations\r\nexists so that all of our citizens can benefit from new\r\ntrends in trade, development and technology in order to\r\nachieve growth as individuals and as families and to\r\nimprove their quality of life and feel that they live in a\r\nbetter world where their sons and daughters will be\r\nable to continue to grow, in peace.\r\nTurning to another subject, we are concerned\r\nabout the delay in the adoption of a decision about the\r\nfuture composition of the Security Council, because we\r\nfeel that its enlargement cannot be postponed. Its\r\ncomposition must become more equitable and\r\nrepresentative and allow for a better political balance.\r\nThis gradual process of democratization must begin\r\nwith an increase in both categories of members,\r\npermanent and non-permanent, and it should also\r\ninclude both developed and developing countries.\r\nSpecial attention should be given to the fact that the\r\ndeveloping countries are now under-represented in that\r\nvery important body. Paraguay also believes that this\r\nreform should include the gradual elimination of the\r\nveto rights of the permanent members.\r\nWe welcome the Brahimi report, which\r\nestablishes a valid framework for the reform and\r\nstrengthening of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. Paraguay has always supported such\r\noperations as a fundamental mechanism contributing to\r\nworld peace and security.\r\nI should also like to refer to the regular budget of\r\nthe Organization, in connection with the aspirations of\r\nsome developed countries to reduce their contributions\r\nto a lower percentage. We believe that this should not\r\nmean that the assessed contributions of developing\r\ncountries would increase to unprecedented percentages,\r\neven though the figures involved may seem to others\r\nmodest or insignificant. It is paradoxical that some\r\ndeveloped countries would have their contributions\r\nreduced precisely when they are enjoying excellent\r\neconomic growth, while other countries that are\r\nexperiencing difficulties would see an increase in their\r\ncontributions.\r\nIt is in this context that we must seriously study\r\nthe scale of assessments so that when we adopt it this\r\nyear we will achieve a fair and equitable distribution of\r\nthe financial burden of this Organization. We hope that\r\ntogether we will find balanced solutions and equitable\r\nformulas and timetables for redistributing the\r\nbudgetary burden so that we can promote and\r\nreactivate the participation of large and small States in\r\nour Organization.\r\nInternational relations have acquired a new\r\ndimension as a result of the revolution in computer\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\ntechnology, telecommunications and communications\r\nin general. The effect of this is what we call\r\nglobalization, which has both positive and negative\r\nconsequences. On the one hand it has produced a\r\nchange in the consciousness of human beings, who for\r\nthe first time feel they are part of a whole — that is, of\r\nhumanity in its entirety. On the other hand, it has\r\nincreased the divide between the poorest countries and\r\nthe more advanced countries owing to the advantages\r\naccruing to those that are better prepared for the\r\ndismantling of national barriers. In these conditions,\r\nsolidarity takes on a new urgency. It is an act of justice\r\nfor those peoples who see all their potential progress\r\nsubordinated to this process.\r\nIn this regard, we fully agree with recent\r\nstatements made by the representative of the Holy See\r\nduring the special session of the General Assembly on\r\nsocial development, to the effect that the benefits of\r\ngreat scientific advances must be shared by all peoples\r\nand should not be enjoyed exclusively by the few.\r\nOtherwise we will merely be perpetuating differences\r\nand widening the gap between rich and poor countries.\r\nWe know that decades of development assistance\r\nunder past conditions have not succeeded very well in\r\neradicating poverty and cultural backwardness in vast\r\nregions of the world. Nevertheless, this should not\r\nbecome a pretext for reducing the amount of\r\ndevelopment assistance, especially multilateral\r\nassistance, nor should we see any increase in\r\nconditionality. We believe fully in the multilateral\r\napproach, and we should totally reject conditionality\r\nwhen determining how to provide development\r\nassistance. Nor do we wish to justify the lack of good\r\ngovernance in many nations, which has meant in some\r\ncases that efforts were wasted to a great extent and\r\nonly fuelled corruption and caused the loss of age-old,\r\nnoble traditional practices.\r\nIn the recent elections for the vice-presidency of\r\nthe Republic, my country demonstrated once again the\r\npreference of our region for representative democracy.\r\nIn the elections, which all observers considered\r\nexemplary because of the discipline, civic spirit and\r\nparticipation shown by the citizens, we saw the\r\nelection of the opposition candidate, of the radical\r\nliberal party, Mr. Julio César Franco. The fact that two\r\nparties, until now adversaries, can share power is far\r\nfrom negative. Rather, it constitutes an opportunity to\r\nestablish lasting political stability through the\r\nestablishment of a Government of national unity that\r\ncan efficiently foster the institutional and economic\r\nreforms needed in our country in order to achieve\r\nsustained progress.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour gratitude — to the international community, to our\r\nfriends in the Southern Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR), the Rio Group, the European Union\r\nand the Organization of American States, and to the\r\nUnited States of America, Japan, the Republic of China\r\nand other countries around the world — for their\r\nconstant support for our process of democratization. I\r\nwould like to say to all of them that thanks to their\r\nefforts Paraguay is continuing along the road to\r\ndemocratic growth.\r\nWe are certain that the spread of democracy and\r\nthe increasing exercise of its freedoms by peoples will\r\nbring greater effectiveness to our State institutions in\r\nthe short term. This, together with the increasing role\r\nof the private sector, can create fertile ground for\r\ninvestment and the transformation of productive\r\nactivities in a large part of the world, leading to a\r\nreduction in unemployment and poverty.\r\nInternational cooperation, for its part, must\r\nestablish clear priorities and offer what each of us\r\nneeds. It cannot be simply humanitarian aid, although\r\nhumanitarian aid is fully justified in emergency\r\nsituations. Instead, international cooperation should be\r\naimed at the integral, sustainable development of\r\npeoples. These are two words that are used and\r\nmisused — “integral” and “sustainable”. When we say\r\n“integral”, we understand it to mean that aid must try\r\nto come to grips with the entire set of development\r\nproblems of each country and of each individual, in\r\norder to guarantee respect for human rights — not only\r\npolitical rights but also economic and social rights; and\r\nmerely partial solutions should not be offered.\r\nWhen we say “sustainable” we mean that\r\nassistance must not become an addiction for the\r\nbeneficiaries. It should empower them to continue\r\nalong the road to progress relying on their own efforts\r\nand should guarantee growth for future generations.\r\nCombating poverty means building peace. The\r\nsecurity of the world must be based on the elimination\r\nof the underlying causes of violence, two of the\r\nprincipal causes being ignorance and poverty. This\r\ndoes not exempt us, however, from taking effective\r\nmeasures to limit the use of the instruments of\r\nviolence, from their most deadly form, such as\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nweapons of mass destruction, to the more conventional,\r\nincluding small arms. In the latter case, my country\r\nsupports the initiative to establish an international legal\r\ninstrument with specific measures to check the illegal\r\ntrade in such weapons.\r\nThe preservation of our natural environment is a\r\ngreat source of concern and a subject for reflection.\r\nParaguay, like many other developing countries, gives\r\nextremely high priority in its national policies to\r\npreserving the integrity and diversity of our natural\r\nheritage, handed on by our ancestors. This is not only\r\nbecause on it depends our current and future wealth,\r\nbut also because we are fully aware of our grave\r\nresponsibility to all humanity, since we are the\r\nguardians of resources needed for its very survival.\r\nParaguay reaffirms its resolve to continue\r\nrespecting and implementing the principles established\r\nin Agenda 21. In this regard, we attach high priority to\r\nthe participation of the States parties in the legal\r\nframework developed during the implementation phase\r\nof the Agenda. With great pride I report that Paraguay\r\nis a fully fledged party to the most important\r\ninternational agreements on the environment.\r\nIn this area, finally, it is important to mention the\r\nneed to come to grips with the grave problem of the\r\nunsustainable use of water resources. It is necessary to\r\nintensify scientific cooperation and research in order to\r\nreduce the effects of environmental disasters, both\r\nnatural and man-made.\r\nWe believe that an equitable and fair trade system\r\nis vital for our development. In this regard, we reject\r\nany intent to perpetuate protectionist measures in the\r\ndeveloped countries, particularly subsidies for\r\nagricultural production and exports, as well as the use\r\nof technical regulations as trade barriers against\r\nmanufactured products. We claim our right to free\r\naccess to the world’s markets for those goods in which\r\nwe are competitive.\r\nOn this occasion, as we highlight the importance\r\nof reaffirming our commitment to this Organization, I\r\nbelieve it is appropriate to stress the essential role that\r\nthe international legal framework can play in the\r\nachievement of our common objectives. In this regard,\r\nthe Government of Paraguay has paid special attention\r\nto the invitation by the Secretary-General to all\r\nMember States to take advantage of this opportunity to\r\nstrengthen our support for the international legal\r\nframework by signing, ratifying or acceding to treaties\r\ndeposited with him that bear a special relationship to\r\nthe spirit and objectives of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn this respect, I am very pleased to announce that\r\non behalf of the Government of the Republic of\r\nParaguay I have signed the following international\r\ninstruments: the Optional Protocols to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child — on the involvement of\r\nchildren in armed conflict, and on the sale of children,\r\nchild prostitution and child pornography; the\r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the\r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their\r\nFamilies; and the International Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. I\r\nshould also note that the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, of which Paraguay was\r\none of the first signatories, is in the process of\r\nparliamentary approval.\r\nI conclude by reaffirming the conviction of my\r\ncountry’s firm belief in the United Nations, which is\r\nmore necessary than ever in order to meet the great\r\nchallenges of peace and development, which, despite\r\nsignificant progress, continue to be an urgent need of a\r\ngreat part of humanity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Li Hyong Chol,\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, I should like first of all to congratulate\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri on his election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. I believe\r\nthat the present session will produce the desired results\r\nunder his leadership. I pay tribute to his predecessor\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who made a great contribution\r\nto the successful conclusion of the fifty-fourth session.\r\nI wish also to express our great appreciation for the\r\nefforts made by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations.\r\nThe central role of the United Nations in the new\r\ncentury should be to establish international relations\r\nand order to make the new century independent,\r\npeaceful and prosperous. No country can either defend\r\nits national dignity or achieve social and economic\r\ndevelopment when its national sovereignty is violated.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nThis is the lesson for mankind on the threshold of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIt is the common aspiration of the world’s peoples\r\nthat the twenty-first century should be a century of\r\nindependence, peace and development. Genuine peace\r\nand prosperity on our planet can be achieved only\r\nwhen the sovereignty of all countries is respected.\r\nWe regard independence as our life and soul. The\r\nidea of independence runs through all domestic and\r\nforeign policies and lines of the Government of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. This is the\r\nbrilliant embodiment of the independent policy of the\r\ngreat leader General Kim Jong Il. The reality\r\nprevailing on the Korean peninsula clearly testifies to\r\nthe justness of the independent policies consistently\r\ncarried out by the Government of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea.\r\nWithout independence, it is unthinkable that our\r\ncountry could overcome the manifold difficulties and\r\nadvance the building of a powerful nation convincingly\r\nalong the road chosen by its people.\r\nThe independent foreign policy of the\r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea makes a tangible contribution to peace and\r\nstability in North-East Asia. It can be said that it is\r\nentirely because of our firm adherence to independence\r\nthat our country has been able to play a buffer-zone\r\nrole effectively in the intersection of the divergent\r\ngeopolitical interests of several countries. We take\r\npride in the independent foreign policy of our\r\nGovernment, as it contributes to maintaining the\r\nbalance of power and preventing a war in North-East\r\nAsia.\r\nThe independent policy of the Government of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea also gives full\r\nplay to its vitality in advancing the cause of peace and\r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula. The General\r\nAssembly at its twenty-eighth session in 1973\r\nunanimously welcomed the three principles of\r\nindependence, peaceful reunification and great national\r\nunity which had been agreed upon by the north and the\r\nsouth of the Korean peninsula. These three principles\r\nof national reunification are the grand programme of\r\nreunification put forward by President Kim Il Sung, the\r\ngreat leader of our people, and constitute the most\r\nessential component of the three-point charter for\r\nnational reunification defined by the respected General\r\nKim Jong Il.\r\nAt the historic Pyongyang meeting in June this\r\nyear, the leaders of the North and the South reaffirmed\r\nthese three principles of national reunification, and on\r\nthis basis the North-South joint declaration on solving\r\nthe reunification question independently by the\r\nconcerted efforts of our nation was made public. The\r\nsummit meeting and the resulting joint declaration\r\nrepresent a historic milestone, marking a turning-point\r\nin achieving the cause of independent reunification of\r\nour nation.\r\nAmidst the increased spirit of national\r\nindependence and reunification, North-South\r\nministerial talks for reconciliation and collaboration\r\nare being held and the reunions of separated families\r\nrealized. Mutual visits between the North and the South\r\nthrough, inter alia, direct flights between Pyongyang\r\nand Seoul are now commonplace, and a project is\r\nunderway to re-link the railways between the North and\r\nthe South of Korea.\r\nThis is the brilliant fruition of our independent\r\npolicy and the result of a warm love for the nation and\r\nstrong desire for reunification. It is none other than the\r\nKorean nation that is responsible for Korea’s\r\nreunification question. Korea’s reunification should be\r\nachieved independently by the concerted efforts of the\r\nKoreans in the North and the South, as stated in the\r\nNorth-South joint declaration. Reunification will come\r\nabout if both sides take realistic and practical measures\r\nfor establishing a reunified State by making the most of\r\ncommon elements of the federation and the\r\nconfederation proposed by the North and the South\r\nrespectively.\r\nThe independent reunification of our nation will\r\nsurely lead to a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula,\r\nand we believe that this will in turn contribute to peace\r\nand security in Asia and the rest of the world.\r\nThe turning point created on the Korean\r\npeninsula is a positive development of global\r\nsignificance. We consider that the present trend\r\ntowards the improvement of North-South relations and\r\nreunification is a process that should be valued for the\r\nsake of peace and security in North-East Asia as well.\r\nIf this process is to continue to gain momentum, the\r\ncountries concerned should work in support of the\r\nprocess, rather than disturbing it.\r\nThe United States has created our non-existent\r\n“missile threat” in order to justify the establishment of\r\nits “theatre missile defense” and “national missile\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\ndefense” systems. Nevertheless, it gives rise to\r\nworldwide concern about its danger.\r\nOur missile programme is of a peaceful nature,\r\nfor all intents and purposes. All countries have an equal\r\nsovereign right, recognized by the United Nations, to\r\nconduct research on and make use of the outer space. It\r\nis therefore totally unfair for the United States to take\r\nissue only with our rockets while many other countries\r\nare launching their own space rockets. If hostile\r\nrelations are removed and confidence is built between\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the\r\nUnited States, there will be ways to address the\r\nconcerns on both sides.\r\nThe recent incident that prevented the President\r\nof the Presidium of our Supreme People’s Assembly\r\nfrom attending the Millennium Summit is, after all, the\r\nmanifestation of the continued hostile policy pursued\r\nby the United States against the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, in labelling our country a\r\n“terrorism-sponsoring nation”. In this regard, we note\r\nthat the United States has recognized its responsibility\r\nfor the incident and given assurances that such\r\nincidents would not occur again. We also note the\r\nrecently stated United States position that it has no\r\nreason to perpetuate its hostile relations with our\r\ncountry. If this position is put into practice, we will be\r\nready to respond in a positive way at any time.\r\nAnother factor that casts a shadow on positive\r\ndevelopment on the Korean peninsula is the suspicious\r\nfuture of Japan. Whether Japan revives its militarist\r\nspectre or becomes a peace-loving country is a serious\r\nquestion directly linked to peace and stability in Asia,\r\nparticularly in its neighbouring Korean peninsula.\r\nContinued evasion by Japan on settling its past with\r\nour country is the main factor that makes us suspicious\r\nof its future orientation. Moreover, such suspicion is\r\nincreased as we witness Japanese moves to find\r\npretexts for justifying its rearmament by targeting our\r\ncountry as its “enemy”.\r\nShould Japan take the path of militarism, it will\r\nobviously strain its relations with other Asian countries\r\nand exert negative effects on the improvement of\r\nNorth-South relations. We hope Japan will not go in\r\nthis direction. Japan should find its future in a sincere\r\nand early settlement of its past. Now that the North-\r\nSouth joint declaration is being smoothly implemented,\r\nnew, sound international relations will be established in\r\nNorth-East Asia once the hostile relations between the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United\r\nStates, and between the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea and Japan, are resolved.\r\nIn conformity with this encouraging process, the\r\nUnited Nations should also take practical measures to\r\ndismantle the “United Nations Command”, a legacy of\r\nthe cold war, thus making a due contribution to this\r\nprocess.\r\nIn order to establish fair international relations\r\nand an international order that will properly represent\r\nthe new century, it is important to successfully\r\novercome the challenges to the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe most serious challenge posed in international\r\nrelations at present is the emergence of the concept of\r\n“humanitarian intervention”.\r\nThe United Nations is based on the principle of\r\nsovereign equality. The Charter enshrines the principles\r\nof respect for sovereignty and non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs as a cornerstone of international\r\nrelations.\r\nThese are the major principles based on the\r\nreality in which big and small countries exist in the\r\nworld. All countries aspire to independence and\r\nstruggle to defend their national sovereignty.\r\nEncroachment upon the sovereignty of small countries\r\nby big Powers in exercise of power politics is an act of\r\nhigh-handedness, as already judged by the times.\r\n“Humanitarian intervention” is a dangerous concept\r\nthat could beautify such acts of high-handedness and\r\neliminate the essential spirit of the Charter.\r\nThe international relations of the new century\r\nshould serve to terminate arbitrariness and high-\r\nhandedness, such as threatening sovereign States by\r\nforce and imposing sanctions on them, and to fully\r\nimplement the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter. International peace and security\r\nshould be achieved by strengthening the role of the\r\nUnited Nations, not by arbitrariness, high-handedness\r\nand intervention by any individual big Power.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in the field of\r\ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, should\r\nbe enhanced. Despite an ever-growing desire and\r\nexpectation by international society for disarmament\r\nafter the end of the cold war, the disarmament process\r\nis at a standstill, faced with new challenges. Reality\r\nrequires that the nuclear disarmament process be turned\r\ninto a United Nations process, instead of being left to\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nthe nuclear-weapon States alone. We are of the view\r\nthat the fourth special session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament should be\r\nheld as early as possible, taking into due consideration\r\nthe demand of a large number of countries.\r\nAnother challenge to be effectively countered by\r\nthe United Nations in international relations is an\r\nattempt to politicize the human rights issue. Along with\r\nthe use of force, the human rights issue constitutes one\r\nof the two factors straining international relations. This\r\nis demonstrated in the reality in which United Nations\r\nmeetings that address human rights issues are often\r\nconverted into an arena of confrontation, not\r\ncooperation. In fact, there is no more grave human\r\nrights violation than abusing the human rights issue for\r\npolitical purposes. The United Nations should enhance\r\nits role decisively to ensure that fairness is fully\r\nobserved, and not acquiesce in the application of\r\ndouble standards when dealing with human rights\r\nissues.\r\nThe twenty-first century should be a century of\r\ndevelopment. Durable international peace and security\r\nare inconceivable without the eradication of poverty\r\nand the solution of social and economic problems. A\r\nfair international economic order which is conducive to\r\nsustainable economic development for the developing\r\ncountries should be established as early as possible. In\r\nparticular, it is imperative that the United Nations\r\nfurther the analysis and assessment of the nature and\r\ndanger of globalization, as well as its impact on the\r\ndeveloping countries, and take necessary measures. In\r\nthis regard, we believe that the Declaration and Action\r\nProgramme adopted at the South Summit held in Cuba\r\nlast April can serve as an excellent basis for that\r\npurpose.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to play a role\r\ncommensurate with the requirements of the new\r\ncentury, it should be democratized through reform of\r\nits structure. The main purpose of United Nations\r\nreform is to ensure democracy and strict observance of\r\nthe principles of justice and fairness in all its activities.\r\nThe General Assembly has now been relatively\r\ndemocratized, but it does not have sufficient authority.\r\nIn contrast, the Security Council has authority and\r\naction capability but falls short of the desired degree of\r\ndemocracy. In particular, the present structure of the\r\nSecurity Council leaves a vacuum which allows the\r\nUnited Nations to be used as a tool of high-handedness,\r\nfor the Council monopolizes decision-making power on\r\nsuch critical issues as enforcement action, including the\r\nuse of force. The twentieth century witnessed such\r\ncases on several occasions.\r\nWe hold that the enhancement of the authority of\r\nthe General Assembly is a prerequisite for ensuring\r\ndemocracy in United Nations activities. The Assembly\r\nmust be empowered at least to review the issues of\r\ninternational peace and security and to approve major\r\ndecisions and resolutions of the Security Council on\r\nthese issues.\r\nIn reforming the Security Council, priority should\r\nbe given to increasing the number of non-permanent\r\nseats, thus correcting the present imbalance in regional\r\nrepresentation. It is also imperative that effective ways\r\nbe sought to ensure strict observance of the principles\r\nof justice and fairness in United Nations activities.\r\nWe consider that one means to this end will be to\r\nrestore the confidence of the international community\r\nin the United Nations by redressing those issues\r\nmishandled in the past by the United Nations, in\r\ncontradiction to the purposes and principles of its\r\nCharter, by force of arbitrariness and high-handedness.\r\nIndependence, peace and friendship are the\r\nfundamental ideas of the foreign policy of the\r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea. The Democratic People’s Republic will remain\r\ntrue to this idea and faithfully discharge its obligations\r\nas a Member State of the United Nations, so that the\r\nUnited Nations can become a truly effective\r\norganization that creditably serves the aspirations and\r\nrequirements of the new century.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Wladyslaw\r\nBartoszewski, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Poland.\r\nMr. Bartoszewski (Poland) (spoke in Polish;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Allow me\r\nfirst of all to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri on his\r\nelection as President of the Millennium session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Polish delegation expresses its\r\nsatisfaction that the presidency of this session has been\r\nentrusted to an eminent statesman from Finland, a\r\ncountry with which we have ties of friendship and\r\ncooperation based on common values and aspirations.\r\nHe may count on my delegation’s full cooperation in\r\nthe performance of his important tasks.\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nMy congratulations also to the Assembly’s\r\noutgoing President, Minister Theo-Ben Guribab, for the\r\noutstanding commitment and skill he displayed during\r\nhis presidency.\r\nOn behalf of Poland, allow me also to welcome to\r\nthe United Nations the new Member, Tuvalu.\r\nI should also like to express my appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\r\noutstanding manner in which he has demonstrated his\r\nqualities of leadership and good judgement, and in\r\nparticular for his inspirational report, “We the peoples:\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury”.\r\nAlthough the start of the new millennium is still a\r\nfew months away, a new era actually began a little\r\nearlier. It was marked by the demise of the world’s\r\nideological polarization into East and West and\r\ndivision into three worlds, and by the emergence of the\r\nworld economy. Humankind enters this new era, the\r\nage of globalization, with the immense opportunity to\r\nexpand the spheres of freedom and prosperity brought\r\nby the triumph of democracy and advances in\r\ntechnology, especially the achievements of the\r\ninformation revolution.\r\nBehind us we have left the twentieth century, an\r\nage of extremes and profound contradictions. It was an\r\nage of man’s triumphs and downfalls, alternating\r\nsetbacks and advances in the evolution of the\r\ninternational community. On the one hand, we have\r\nwitnessed of amazing scientific, technological and\r\nmaterial progress, the spread of human rights and\r\ndemocracy and the development of universal\r\ninternational institutions. On the other hand, it was also\r\nan age of the most horrendous dramas in contemporary\r\nhuman history, of the tragedies, atrocities and\r\ndevastation of two world wars, of the utmost contempt\r\nfor the human being, and of genocide and blind\r\nviolence perpetrated by utopias intent on thus building\r\n“brave new worlds”. The Polish poet and Nobel\r\nlaureate in literature in 1980, Czeslaw Milosz, wrote in\r\nThe Witness of History that the twentieth century’s\r\noriginal contribution to the history of the human race\r\nwas “the near disappearance of the concept of values”\r\nand concluded: “The extermination camp became the\r\ncentral fact of the century.”\r\nNonetheless, the end of this century seems to\r\nbring more optimism. This is not only the assessment\r\nof the Foreign Minister of reborn and democratic\r\nPoland. It is also the personal feeling of a man who,\r\nhaving been a prisoner of two totalitarian systems, the\r\nNazi and the Communist — incidentally, I am, I think,\r\nthe only Foreign Minister to hold this “distinction” —\r\nhas known the sufferings specific to this century, and it\r\nreflects the hope ingrained in human nature. But as\r\nwell as destruction and hatred, I have also been, since\r\nas long ago as the days of the Holocaust, a witness of\r\nand participant in a struggle for the dignity and the\r\nrights of the human being and the process of my\r\ncountry’s recovery of independence and arduous\r\nconstruction of democracy.\r\nMy history of active participation in transforming\r\nthe conditions of human existence, in its individual and\r\ncollective dimension, began in the yard of the\r\nconcentration camp of Auschwitz. Later, enlistment in\r\nthe Polish resistance and, in particular, participation in\r\nassistance for the inhabitants of the Warsaw Ghetto.\r\nNext, the unimaginable inferno of the Warsaw uprising\r\nin 1944 and the death, as it seemed at the time, of\r\nWarsaw. Finally, the end of the war. I remember the joy\r\nand hope with which we greeted the United Nations\r\nCharter and the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. They gave me strength when I found myself\r\nhaving to survive the ordeal of years in Communist\r\njails. From them, too, I drew inspiration on the journey\r\nthat eventually led me and my political friends to\r\nGdansk, the city for which our allies were unwilling to\r\ndie in 1939 and in which the next great turning-point in\r\nthe history of the past century was launched in 1980.\r\nIndeed, two weeks ago we celebrated in Poland\r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the foundation of the\r\nSolidarity movement, the Polish revolution that was at\r\nfirst suppressed at gunpoint by the totalitarian regime\r\nbut that, becoming an emblem of hope, weathered\r\nrepression and an unfavourable set of international\r\ncircumstances. The rebirth of Solidarity in 1989 and\r\nthe Polish Round Table opened the way to historic\r\nchanges, including the fall of the Berlin Wall and the\r\ncollapse of the Communist bloc, and in consequence\r\nset in motion a sweeping transformation of the\r\ninternational system. Having been involved for over 60\r\nyears in these processes, as a writer, historian,\r\nuniversity lecturer and, currently, Foreign Minister, I\r\nfeel — if the Assembly will forgive the personal tone\r\nof this confession — as if I were a living, physical\r\nsymbol of humanity’s stormy voyage through the\r\nhistory of the past century.\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nBut let me also say that the traumatic experiences\r\nof my nation have made the Poles exceptionally aware\r\nof the value of peace and any manifestations of good\r\nthat are lastingly present in international life. Making\r\nour contribution to the positive culmination of the\r\ntwentieth century and working towards the\r\nrevitalization of the message of the United Nations,\r\nand thereby opening up new prospects for the\r\nOrganization, we see ourselves as full and active\r\nmembers of the global family of nations. A further\r\nsource of the sense of security and confidence that\r\nfortifies us in this role within the United Nations is that\r\nwe have become a member of the North Atlantic\r\nAlliance and are forging ever-closer ties with the\r\nEuropean Union, which we expect to join in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nBolstered by our accomplishments in the past\r\ndecade, having reclaimed our place on the international\r\nstage, we are eager to participate together with other\r\nnations in this generally perceptible shift towards\r\nvalues. A yearning for a world imbued with moral\r\nvalues is visible in all civilizations and religions. This\r\nis especially evident in the waning of the unlawful use\r\nof force in international life. The recent outbreaks seen\r\nhere and there are an echo of divisions and conflicts\r\nthat are fading along with the twentieth century. This\r\npositive tendency can be observed in Europe, in the\r\nMiddle East, in North-East Asia and in other parts of\r\nthe world. Contributing to it is a growing respect for\r\nhuman rights and appreciation of the economic and\r\nsocial factors involved in their full achievement.\r\nAgainst this background, the Polish people hold\r\nin great esteem the peace mission of John Paul II, the\r\nPope from Poland — a Pope whose pontificate, like the\r\nwhole course of his life, personifies, beacon-like, an\r\nunwavering adherence to values and, through the\r\nsymbol of open arms, understanding and reconciliation.\r\nThe Pope’s position not only fills us with pride but is\r\nalso a model for our international behaviour. The\r\nbearings guiding our actions, including here in the\r\nUnited Nations, are tolerance, openness and respect for\r\nthe dignity and rights of the individual, minorities and\r\nwhole nations. We are determined to oppose every kind\r\nof discrimination and prejudice, whether on ethnic,\r\nnational, religious or social grounds. In this cause,\r\nPoland is and will continue to be a staunch ally of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe are entering the twenty-first century with the\r\nimmense potential generated by the newest phase of the\r\nrevolution in science, technology, mass\r\ncommunications, the opening up of frontiers, the\r\ndevelopment of inter-societal ties and the\r\nuniversalization of democracy and human rights. Most\r\nof these phenomena are encompassed by the common\r\nterm “globalization”. For a number of years,\r\nassessment of their consequences has, especially in the\r\nwake of regional financial crises, been growing\r\nincreasingly contentious. Sometimes they are treated as\r\na force of nature sweeping all before them, as morally\r\nneutral processes that can do good or harm and that\r\neventually will bring prosperity to all peoples or be a\r\nsource of crises, inequality and instability within\r\nnations and on an international scale.\r\nGlobalization has unquestionably beneficial\r\neffects in the sphere of trade, production, the spread of\r\nmodern technologies and capital flows. The\r\nliberalization of international trade, the growth of\r\nworld output and the prosperity of societies should\r\nbring a more equitable sharing of the benefits of\r\nglobalization. At the same time, there are looming\r\ndangers, harmful side-effects and new problems whose\r\nscale and nature we are not yet capable of identifying\r\ncorrectly. The challenge facing us is to work together\r\nto steer these processes in such a way that it is their\r\nblessings that are mainly felt by humanity, and that\r\nthey are prevented from creating new divides in the\r\nworld. We must do everything in our power, including\r\nhere at the United Nations, to ensure that these\r\nprocesses mean the globalization of good.\r\nFaced with the opportunities, but also the threats,\r\npresented by the evolution of human civilization at the\r\nthreshold of the third millennium, the international\r\ncommunity needs to organize around a question of\r\nbasic importance to the direction of its future\r\ndevelopment. That was the purpose of the Government\r\nof Poland when it decided, together with the\r\nGovernments of Chile, India, the Republic of Korea,\r\nMali, the United States and the Czech Republic, to\r\ninitiate broader international collaboration in the cause\r\nof consolidation and promotion of democracy in the\r\nworld.\r\nIn this gathering there is no need to argue the\r\nvirtues of democracy. No one disputes the positive\r\ninterrelationship between democracy and human rights,\r\ninternal and international peace, economic growth and\r\nprosperity and better realization of the principles of\r\njustice and solidarity. At the same time, we cannot\r\nignore the threats to democracy, which are primarily of\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nan internal nature. They affect countries in the process\r\nof democratic transition as well as so-called mature\r\ndemocracies. They cover a wide spectrum, ranging\r\nfrom poverty and economic underdevelopment, ethnic\r\nconflicts and organized crime to corruption and the\r\nexclusion of whole sectors of public life, notably\r\nfinance and the media, from democratic control, which\r\nsaps the foundations of democracy and demeans it in\r\nthe eyes of society. Democracy, its condition and\r\nprospects, can and should be no less a legitimate\r\nsubject of international debate and cooperation than the\r\nother great issues of our times: human rights,\r\ndisarmament, the environment and the like.\r\nImbued with this belief, we embarked, in\r\nconjunction with a number of other States, on\r\norganizing in June of this year an international\r\nconference, “Towards a Community of Democracies”.\r\nA total of 107 States accepted our invitation. Speaking\r\nat the Warsaw conference, Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan said,\r\n“One of the greatest challenges to\r\nhumankind in the new century will be the\r\nstruggle to make the practice of democracy\r\nequally universal. In that struggle, nations in\r\nwhich democracy is already well established will\r\nneed to be vigilant in preserving that\r\nachievement”.\r\nThe participants in the conference adopted the Warsaw\r\nDeclaration, in which they reaffirmed their\r\ncommitment to its catalogue of democratic values and\r\nstandards. They also undertook to pursue informal\r\ncooperation to strengthen and promote democracy in\r\nvarious international organizations. For obvious\r\nreasons, the key question will be what can be done to\r\nadvance this cause in the framework of and through the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to recall another\r\nPolish initiative that also falls within the current of\r\nresponses to the harmful side effects of globalization\r\nprocesses. In 1996, at the General Assembly, Poland\r\nsubmitted a proposal to frame a universal legal\r\ninstrument, the first of its kind, that could help us\r\ncombat one of the greatest dangers of our times:\r\ninternational organized crime. At this session the text\r\nof that Convention will be presented to the General\r\nAssembly for its approval.\r\nThe central issue of successive international\r\nagendas is security. Though preserving international\r\npeace and security is the main purpose of the United\r\nNations, States have also looked to other ways to\r\nensure their security: through creation of balance-of-\r\npower systems, arms races and even the use of force.\r\nToday we are trying to achieve such goals by different\r\nmeans. Anachronistic doctrines of geopolitics and\r\nspheres of influence are now fading into history. The\r\nRoman maxim, “If you want peace, prepare for war” —\r\nSi vis pacem para bellum — is becoming irrelevant.\r\nNevertheless, the problem of security remains a\r\npressing one, as the numerous conflicts and\r\nhumanitarian dramas in various parts of the world\r\nmake all too clear. In addition to crises and wars\r\ninherited from the old international order, we are\r\nplagued by conflicts which spring from poverty, ethnic\r\nand religious strife or the atrophying of States’ ability\r\nto perform their basic functions: providing the people\r\nliving within their borders with internal security and\r\ndecent conditions of existence.\r\nThis new situation, in which security depends not\r\nso much on purely military factors as on social\r\nstability, on observance of human rights and the rights\r\nof national minorities or on access to drinking water,\r\nenhances the role of the United Nations, which can\r\ndraw on unique experience and a wide range of non-\r\nmilitary instruments for ensuring security. Fuller\r\ninvolvement by the United Nations in the security\r\nsphere as provided in the mandate deriving from its\r\nCharter requires determined continuation of reform of\r\nthe Organization in this field, starting with a practical\r\nredefinition of the role of the Security Council that\r\nwould extend its purview to non-traditional threats to\r\ninternational security.\r\nThe Security Council must do what, in\r\naccordance with the Charter, is expected of it by\r\nMembers and respond more decisively to signs of\r\nbudding conflicts or humanitarian disasters. The\r\nKosovo drama, like many others, could have been\r\navoided if Security Council members had displayed\r\nsufficient imagination and resolve at the right time.\r\nThat would also have enabled us to avoid last year’s\r\narguments and controversies over the issue of\r\nhumanitarian intervention. The inability of the Security\r\nCouncil to respond robustly in such situations will\r\nopen the way to further precedents for sidestepping the\r\nCharter and United Nations mechanisms in the security\r\nsphere and could thereby lead to disintegration of this\r\nsystem.\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nThe success and effectiveness of the proposals\r\nand recommendations contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Millennium report will depend on the\r\ndetermination of the Security Council as the system’s\r\nlynch-pin. Poland endorses the report’s perspective on\r\ninternational problems and approach to tackling them.\r\nWe are in favour of stronger legal instruments for\r\nstabilizing the international order; this refers to\r\nsituations involving threats to security and use of force,\r\nto respect for human rights and to arms control and\r\nlimitation. In all these areas we must preserve the\r\nprimacy of the United Nations system over regional or\r\nunilateral measures, which are acceptable only in the\r\nexceptional circumstances in which the Security\r\nCouncil and United Nations mechanisms are found\r\nwanting.\r\nIn this context I should also like to pay tribute to\r\nthe Brahimi report on United Nations peace operations.\r\nAs a long-standing and very active participant in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions, Poland is in\r\nfavour of streamlining the machinery for conducting\r\nthem — from decision-making to presence in the\r\nfield — and ensuring their greater effectiveness by\r\nwidening and making more adequate the array of\r\ninstruments with which such operations are equipped.\r\nThis means both the possibility of the use of force by\r\nthe units deployed in an operation and a wide spectrum\r\nof peace-building and post-conflict rehabilitation\r\ncapabilities. I refer also to action aimed at advancing\r\nhuman rights and laying the groundwork for democracy\r\nin the institutional and civil society sphere. In our\r\nview, in further work on the recommendations of the\r\nreport, greater emphasis should be put on the question\r\nof cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations, an area in which lie many\r\nhitherto untapped opportunities, as well on as a more\r\ncreative approach to conflict prevention.\r\nWe no longer seek foundations for a future\r\ninternational order in military capacities, but to an ever\r\ngreater degree we are trying to build it on fair and\r\nrespected laws. The maxim Si vis pacem para iustitiam\r\nwhich adorns the facade of the Palace of Justice in The\r\nHague no longer has quite the idealistic ring that it had\r\nseveral decades ago. But we are also aware that though\r\nadministering justice through law is an indispensable\r\ncondition of peace, it is not yet a sufficient condition.\r\nOur times, in which conflicts and instability are often a\r\nresult of poverty and underdevelopment, require the\r\napplication of a new maxim, a contemporary\r\nparaphrase of the old ones: Si vis pacem para\r\nsolidaritatem.\r\nHere, we are entering the domain of the\r\ninternational economic order, in particular its financial\r\nand trade dimensions. This is a sphere in which the\r\nUnited Nations system must be much more active than\r\nhitherto or run the risk of being sidelined by the new\r\nand powerful non-State actors in international life. The\r\nrecently fashionable, if ill-defined, formula of global\r\ngovernance should at the practical level be developed\r\nin the United Nations framework or in concert with,\r\nnot parallel or counter to, the United Nations. First and\r\nforemost, it is essential to intensify international efforts\r\nto promote stability and predictability in international\r\neconomic relations, which includes strengthening the\r\nnew international financial architecture of a system and\r\ninstitutions based on transparent rules.\r\nWhat is also needed — and this is a point that\r\nclearly emerges from the reports of the main\r\ninternational organizations, the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport included — is a new approach to development.\r\nOne has to agree with those who maintain that there is\r\nno greater challenge today than global sustainable\r\ndevelopment and that United Nations success or failure\r\nwill be crucial to the outcome of efforts by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOne of the key challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity as it enters the twenty-first century is\r\npoverty reduction, especially in the least developed\r\ncountries. Success in this field requires wide\r\napplication of the principle of solidarity in\r\ninternational economic relations. If globalization is to\r\nbe harnessed to development and poverty reduction,\r\nmore is needed than just better coordination among the\r\norganizations active in the socio-economic sphere. It is\r\nalso necessary to stop perceiving development and\r\npoverty reduction solely as technical problems. To\r\nattack them effectively, there has to be a coherent\r\npolicy that comprises not only financial and technical\r\nassistance but also substantive measures in the sphere\r\nof education, culture, good governance, rule of law,\r\ndemocratic institutions, etc.\r\nInternational solidarity will not deliver results in\r\nthe shape of building up the production capacities of\r\nthe poorest countries and enabling them to reap\r\nbenefits from globalization processes without serious\r\nefforts on the part of these countries themselves, in\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nparticular rational economic policies and the ability to\r\nmake effective use of development aid.\r\nPoland is joining in international endeavours to\r\nfurther effective management of international\r\ninterdependence, with an appropriate role played by the\r\nUnited Nations system and a key role by international\r\nfinancial institutions in the organization of\r\ninternational economic and financial cooperation. In\r\nthe framework of a poverty reduction strategy, we are\r\nparticipating in the implementation of the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Poland also\r\nsupports the European Union proposal that World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) members, including in the\r\nfirst place the industrialized countries, should within a\r\nyear of the conclusion of a new trade round abolish\r\nimport tariffs and quotas on basically all exports from\r\nthe least developed countries.\r\nIt is precisely in order to stress what we believe\r\nto be the crucial significance of solidarity in\r\nmaintaining peace, security and solidarity throughout\r\nthe world that the Polish Government, mindful of the\r\nexperiences of our recent history, will — together with\r\na few other countries — propose that the United\r\nNations proclaim 31 August as “International\r\nSolidarity Day”; it is the date of the establishment of\r\nthe free and independent Solidarity trade union in\r\nPoland in 1980.\r\nThe qualitatively new feature of the situation at\r\nthe turn of the century is not only the extent but the\r\ngreater complexity of the tasks facing our\r\nOrganization. Greater still are the expectations\r\nassociated with it of individuals, diverse groups,\r\nnations and the whole international community. It is\r\nessential that we not only understand the nature of the\r\nnew problems but also deal more effectively with the\r\nmatters that have to be tackled by the United Nations,\r\nwhether or not they form an explicit part of the\r\nmandate deriving from the Charter. In roles ranging\r\nfrom preserving peace to human rights, and from\r\ndevelopment to protection of the natural environment,\r\nthe United Nations is irreplaceable. It is precisely\r\nbecause of the nature of threats such as environmental\r\ndegradation in the contemporary world that a speedy\r\nand comprehensive response by the United Nations is\r\nneeded. The sense of “one earth, one human race”\r\nrequires solidarity-driven and responsible action by all\r\nthe system’s participants.\r\nThe tasks and expectations associated with the\r\nUnited Nations require that its role in international\r\nrelations be strengthened. The system must continue to\r\nbe the legal and institutional infrastructure of the\r\ninternational order. No other formula provides\r\nsufficient legitimization for the performance of this\r\nrole. The United Nations Charter and Organization are\r\nindispensable, in the first place, to small and medium-\r\nsized countries. Marginalization of the United Nations\r\nwould lead to anarchy, in which the only law would be\r\nthe will of the great Powers and increasingly powerful\r\nnon-State actors.\r\nThe extremely positive trends towards\r\ninvolvement of non-governmental organizations in\r\nUnited Nations activities — a trend steadfastly\r\nchampioned by Poland — must remain consonant with\r\nthe intergovernmental character of the Organization,\r\nwhose universal mandate stems from the legitimacy of\r\nthe States which are its Members. Within this system\r\nwe must, however, be mindful not only of the rights of\r\nStates but also of their obligations.\r\nAccountability does not apply only to individuals,\r\nthough here we are in favour of prompt entry into force\r\nof the treaty establishing the International Criminal\r\nCourt. We cannot allow the United Nations to tolerate a\r\nsituation of non-accountability of States for violations\r\nof international law.\r\nThe successes of any organization, its usefulness\r\nand effectiveness, are not only a matter of the\r\ndetermination and unanimity of its members. Much\r\nalso depends on the resources at its disposal, the\r\nefficiency of its procedures and the competence of the\r\npeople operating them. In the past, United Nations\r\nofficers have provided innumerable examples of their\r\ndedication in pursuing the Organization’s activities, of\r\ntheir commitment to serving the ideals actuating the\r\nUnited Nations. Better use needs to be made of their\r\npotential through constant adaptation of the\r\nOrganization’s structures and mechanisms to changing\r\ntasks. That will also make for much better disposition\r\nof the Organization’s budget.\r\nIn our drive to rationalize the United Nations\r\nbudget, our focus should not be on ways of reducing it.\r\nThe real problem is that there is not enough money to\r\ndo all the things that everyone expects the Organization\r\nto be doing. The United Nations budget should be\r\ntailored to the tasks that we ask it to perform, but also\r\nmore effectively. We are also aware that the\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.17\r\nOrganization’s regular budget and its peacekeeping\r\nbudget should be based on the principle of the ability\r\nto pay and on realistic economic indicators. Poland is\r\nprepared to accept any reasonable and fair changes that\r\nmay be agreed on the future scale of contributions. We\r\nwill play a constructive part in negotiations on this\r\nproblem.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I shall\r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to speak in\r\nright of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements made in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Shakerian (Islamic Republic of Iran): My\r\ndelegation rejects the claim raised today by the\r\ndelegation of United Arab Emirates against the\r\nterritorial integrity of my country and would point out\r\nthat such assertions are unacceptable. Since our\r\nposition on the three Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf\r\nis very clear, I need not go into specifics. I should\r\nmerely like to emphasize that the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran has been and continues to be prepared to discuss\r\nthe issue in good faith with the authorities of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates. We remain hopeful that officials\r\nof the Emirates will respond positively to our call for\r\ndiscussions on the basis of the 1971 Understanding.\r\nMr. Al Hassan (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I should be pleased if our neighbours and\r\nbrothers in Iran would translate their words into action,\r\nbeginning tomorrow. But it is regrettable that the\r\nappeal of Iran for dialogue among civilizations which\r\nwas announced by President Khatami and which we\r\nconsidered a good omen has since more than one year\r\nnot been translated into practice between Iran and the\r\nEmirates.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates launched an appeal\r\nmore than 10 years ago, asking that an agreement be\r\nreached between Iran and ourselves in a serious and\r\ncreative action. Regrettably, however, as the General\r\nAssembly heard this morning from the Foreign\r\nMinister of the United Arab Emirates, Iran has so far\r\nnot even responded to the appeal made by the tripartite\r\ncommittee formed by the Gulf Cooperation Council to\r\nestablish the machinery for a dialogue between Iran\r\nand the Emirates. Iran has so far not allowed this\r\ncommittee to visit Iran. I should like the words of the\r\nrepresentative of Iran to be translated into action. We\r\nwill be happy to respond.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n"
