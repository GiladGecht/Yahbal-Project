(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I first call on the Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Luxembourg, His Excellency Mr. Hubert\r\nWurth.\r\nMr. Wurth (Luxembourg) (spoke in French):\r\nMs. Lydie Polfer, Vice-Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Luxembourg regrets having had to\r\ncut short her stay in New York. She has asked me to\r\nmake this statement in her place.\r\nThe Millennium Summit has given us the\r\ntestimony of the heads of State and Government. This\r\nexceptional meeting was the opportunity for a renewed\r\ncommitment of States throughout the world to our\r\nOrganization, encouraging common efforts to give\r\nevery citizen the freedom to enjoy a decent life and\r\nopening the way for self-fulfilment for individuals and\r\ntheir communities.\r\nWe congratulate and commend you, Sir, as the\r\nnew President of the General Assembly. We also\r\nexpress our gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-\r\nBen Gurirab, for the vigour of his presidency.\r\nOur Secretary-General has tirelessly emphasized\r\nthe urgent need to act by innovating and ensuring a\r\nsustained pace for the work of the Organization. We\r\nalso commend him and especially encourage him to\r\ncontinue his work.\r\nMy speech today will emphasize the themes of\r\nLuxembourgs message to the Millennium Summit. The\r\nspeech by Mr. Hubert Védrine, the French Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, on behalf of the European Union fully\r\nreflects the point of view of my country.\r\nIn 1999 we restated the main themes of the\r\nLuxembourg Governments involvement in Europe and\r\nwithin the United Nations and its commitment to\r\nstrengthened international solidarity, demonstrated by\r\nthe fact that in 2000 my country has reached the\r\nobjective set by the United Nations of official\r\ndevelopment assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product. This year is a time to speak further of\r\nthe principle of shared responsibility, because the\r\nworld has to face the old challenges of violence and\r\ndevelopment, as well as the more recent one of\r\nglobalization.\r\nGlobalization is both a source of achievement and\r\ncause for concern. It is ambivalent and requires\r\nadequate instruments in order to manage it and gear it\r\ntowards equitable development. Without a common\r\ndefinition of the rules to be applied, it could give rise\r\nto bitterness and revolt. But the use of violence might\r\ncompromise the path towards development. It is a\r\nmatter of concern that worldwide arms sales have been\r\non the rise since 1996. The horror of constant violence\r\ncommitted by human beings against each other could\r\nsimply make us grieve. However, such a passive\r\nattitude would not do justice to the realities of this\r\nworld. The number of armed conflicts has in fact gone\r\ndown, from 55 in 1992 to 36 in 1998, but this bare\r\nstatistic does not explain how this decrease took place.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nHowever, another statistic should grab our attention:\r\nbetween 1974 and 1999, 113 countries went from an\r\nauthoritarian regime to a multi-party system. More\r\nmeaningful than statistics is the encouraging fact that\r\nthe number of negotiation processes has increased, the\r\nkey to their success often being innovative formulas to\r\nachieve peaceful coexistence where previously there\r\nwas deadlock and resentment.\r\nEast Timor, the conference between Somalis in\r\nDjibouti and the new inter-Korean dialogue are recent\r\nexamples. In spite of the obvious difficulties, these\r\nconstructive developments show by their number and\r\ndiversity that preventing conflicts is a strategy in\r\nmotion. We have to consolidate this strategy of\r\nprevention in order to show that it produces lasting\r\nresults. Of course, there are many failures, and we must\r\nnot close our eyes to the difficulties.\r\nIn Kosovo, in particular, intolerant behaviour led\r\nto a sort of blindness, even in people who had\r\nthemselves suffered oppression. Psychology teaches us\r\nthat former victims do not always avoid eventually\r\nbecoming executioners. We must put an end to this\r\nvicious circle and stop unbridled criminality. The\r\ncommitment of the Special Representative, Bernard\r\nKouchner, and of all those who are working to brighten\r\na grey sky brings us a message of hope which will bear\r\nfruit.\r\nAt the end of the cold war our hopes were\r\nperhaps inspired by impatience. Today we see that\r\nthere are solid foundations: above and beyond\r\nacademic investigations and the awakening of\r\nconscience, concrete action is being taken. We thank\r\nthe community of organizations and individuals present\r\nin the field; those who pay with their lives expect\r\nothers to support them and to provide the necessary\r\nmeans.\r\nBut the major responsibility is not to disappoint\r\nthose in direct need of assistance: victims, displaced\r\npersons and refugees, those denied the protection of the\r\nrule of law, even the means of subsistence. And when\r\nmanagement deficiencies lead to short-sighted over-\r\nexploitation and stifling pollution of an environment\r\nthat can take no more, this phenomenon should be\r\nreversed and responsibility established and assumed.\r\nHow can we believe that catastrophes will go\r\nunnoticed or that international solidarity will not bother\r\nto analyse the cause of events?\r\nCrime must not pay. This concept will go from\r\ntheory to practice in the globalization era. Information\r\nis spreading ineluctably and innovations are being\r\nmade. International law may be lagging behind certain\r\ntechnologies, but it is in the process of being\r\ndeveloped. For example, universal participation in the\r\noverall structure of multilateral treaties, which was\r\nstrongly stimulated by the Millennium Summit.\r\nAnother example is the courts to try war crimes,\r\ngenocide or crimes against humanity. After the creation\r\nof tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,\r\nsome countries are considering establishing courts in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations. National courts\r\nhave instituted proceedings, and as a result the era of\r\nimpunity is ending. Luxembourg was the eighteenth\r\nState to ratify the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court, which will go into effect after 41 more\r\nratifications.\r\nIn democracy the rule of law prevails, but\r\npolitical action is crucial to its development. Through\r\nthe major conferences of the 1990s and their follow-\r\nups, the United Nations has shown clearly that such\r\nconferences are also an important source of law. The\r\nguidelines that emerge stimulate the creation of\r\ndomestic laws, and their juxtaposition produces a vast,\r\ninternationally recognized network. Future actions,\r\nincluding the campaign against small arms, financing\r\nfor development and the World Conference against\r\nRacism, will help promote the rule of law. Stable, but\r\nnot rigidly fixed, transparent and subject to democratic\r\ncontrols, the rule of law is certainly one of the most\r\nreliable pillars for development.\r\nBut the international community and the United\r\nNations will have to build other pillars as well as part\r\nof the structure for a world in which poverty and\r\nviolence no longer threaten us. Without going into\r\ndetail, I refer to the need to remember, respect for\r\nequality, the will for prevention and openness to\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe century which is drawing to a close was the\r\nmost terrible in the history of mankind in terms of\r\nabsolute numbers of victims, and also in conceptual\r\nterms, because it led to the development and use of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Above all, it saw several\r\ncases of genocide on an unheard-of scale, openly\r\nmotivated by the most despicable racism. It is essential\r\nto study the mechanisms which lead to these\r\naberrations into inhumanity, because repetitions of such\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\ndestructive phenomena should be rejected and made\r\nimpossible.\r\nThe conclusion to be drawn is that we should\r\nremember, which means escaping from ignorance and\r\nalways bearing in mind the lessons of the past. If the\r\ncountries of the European Union are very sensitive\r\nwhenever they encounter xenophobia, racism and the\r\nrejection of those who are different, it is because we\r\nare resolved at all costs to act to avoid once again\r\nsuccumbing to the sickness of hatred. A Europe with a\r\ngrowing population, a European Union spreading to the\r\neast and the south, must act with determination to\r\ncontinue the course of openness.\r\nLuxembourg is a laboratory with a mixture of\r\npeoples, as a result of our being at the crossroads of\r\nFrench and German culture and because of the impact\r\nof immigration of long ago. The moral outlook of its\r\ncitizens leads them to respect others and their\r\nindividuality. With the coming of sovereignty,\r\nindependence and development became a reality for\r\nour country, and with them a strong adherence to the\r\nprinciple of equality, whether of individuals or States.\r\nIt is the responsibility of all States to expose the\r\ndangers of any tendency to feel contempt for others.\r\nUnfortunately, division and lack of respect for the\r\nworth of the individual can be seen on every continent.\r\nOnly five years ago the world deplored the most\r\nviolent racist crimes in Bosnia and Rwanda. Such\r\ncrimes must be rejected, for they create openings that\r\nthe prejudiced quickly take advantage of. We must\r\ncollectively assume responsibility in the fight against\r\nthis vicious circle.\r\nRespect for equality requires that we do not make\r\nindependence a sanctuary. Rather, it demands that we\r\naccept each other as partners and recognize the\r\nlegitimacy of our respective interests. Thanks to the\r\nprogress of the European Union, classic sovereignty\r\nhas been replaced for its member States by an\r\ninterdependence whose positive effects are impressive.\r\nThe solution, in the year 2000, is no longer abstract\r\nindependence, but concrete cooperation.\r\nThroughout the year 2000, the Security Council\r\nhas devoted a great deal of time to Africa in\r\nrecognition of the seriousness of the phenomenon of\r\ntaking large portions of countries hostage. Some of\r\nthese crises are being fuelled by the exploitation of\r\nnatural resources. The significant international reaction\r\nto these events is encouraging, but it must also lead to\r\nthe elimination of these situations. Among them, I will\r\nmention the problems in Angola, Sierra Leone and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThese catastrophes, along with other\r\ndevelopments  in particular in East Timor, in\r\nsouthern Lebanon and along the border between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea  have contributed to a\r\nconsiderable increase in United Nations peacekeeping\r\nactivities. However, these activities are suffering from\r\na lack of resources, to such an extent that both their\r\noperations and their credibility are compromised.\r\nInstead of being a deterrent, they risk becoming simply\r\nan alibi.\r\nI hope that this session will be able to adopt\r\nenergetic measures to implement the recommendations\r\nof the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations,\r\nchaired by Mr. Brahimi. The lack of financial resources\r\nshould not be an insurmountable obstacle. Further, it is\r\nappropriate to take up this issue as part of this sessions\r\nagenda item on the scale of assessments for\r\npeacekeeping operations. But in fact, these activities\r\nare above all operations aimed at maintaining\r\nceasefires. Achieving peace requires other efforts \r\nfirst and foremost the will to prevent conflicts and the\r\ndetermination to avoid their resurgence.\r\nAfter the research, the passionate discussions and\r\nthe debates  most recently those that took place in\r\nthe Security Council and in the General Assembly\r\ncommittee on the prevention of conflicts in Africa \r\nhave we found sufficient will to now take action? Such\r\na critical mass is necessary if a determined will to\r\nprevent conflicts is going to be manifested.\r\nHuman solidarity will be essential in those\r\ninstances in which the parties show they are incapable\r\nof avoiding conflict and when attacks on the integrity\r\nof individuals and major material consequences can be\r\nclearly foreseen. Indifference and lack of assistance in\r\nthe face of danger no longer accord with the universal\r\nawareness of the reality of our interconnectedness,\r\nwhich grows in parallel with the spread of knowledge.\r\nThis is an ethical issue, but it is also an issue of\r\nknowledge and technical resources. Luxembourg\r\nintends to create a civilian action corps to go on\r\nhumanitarian and human development missions.\r\nLuxembourg will contribute to the United Nations\r\nfunds for peace-building, and it is involved in\r\npeacekeeping operations and in reconstruction\r\nmissions.\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nThe will to prevent conflicts entails the ability to\r\nchoose from among a great range of mechanisms that\r\nare capable of dissuading those who, as a result of\r\nignorance or provocation, are turning to aggression.\r\nThis will to prevent conflicts can be that much more\r\neffective in managing disputes if it is invoked well\r\nbefore violence breaks out. Over eight years, the\r\ndiscreet action of the High Commissioner on National\r\nMinorities of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, Mr. Max van der Stoel, has\r\namply justified the confidence placed in him by 55\r\nEuropean States and former Soviet Republics and has\r\nproduced significant results.\r\nWhen people are struggling in isolation, external\r\ncooperation and solidarity can remove the most\r\ndifficult obstacles. The noteworthy Human\r\nDevelopment Report 2000 of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme stresses the importance of\r\npreventing conflicts, of inclusive democracy and of\r\nrespect for human rights as means of preventing\r\ncountries that have been bled white from being\r\nexcluded from the benefits of the global economy and\r\nof global technology.\r\nFor their part, Mr. Annan and Mr. Brahimi remind\r\nus that every action to reduce poverty and ensure a\r\nsolid foundation for growth is a step towards\r\npreventing conflicts. This is one of the keys of\r\ndevelopment. It is a very reliable method for building\r\nconfidence and reducing poverty. It is a responsibility\r\nthat we must take up.\r\nThe effort cannot be undertaken unless external\r\ncooperation is not in itself an obstacle. In many cases it\r\ngives rise to questions and resistance. But cooperation\r\nthat is not welcome is pointless. Unfortunately, at times\r\nmistrust and a certain pride prevail and lead to a\r\nfortress mentality. This in turn can lead to\r\noveremphasizing identity issues and to the\r\ndevelopment of a mental block.\r\nWhen a terrifying earthquake rocked Turkey in\r\n1999, the Greeks offered their assistance. This gesture\r\nand the Turks acceptance of it have profoundly\r\ntransformed bilateral relations that have been\r\nparticularly difficult. This positive, spontaneous\r\ndevelopment was the result of the awareness of Foreign\r\nMinisters Papandreou and Cem that the ongoing harm\r\nbeing caused by the earlier mistrust was not acceptable.\r\nThis positive development is continuing, and it is\r\ngreatly hoped that it will soon be reflected in the\r\nconversations, under the aegis of the United Nations,\r\nbetween the Greek and Turkish Cypriot\r\ncommunities  conversations that are at present\r\nindirect.\r\nWhen confidence comes up against the invisible\r\nwall of ignorance, even the tendered hand will not be\r\ntaken. Thus, those who are separated by a\r\npsychological chasm should construct a bridgehead and\r\nexpress in a decent manner their willingness to achieve\r\nmutual recognition.\r\nThe Israelis and Palestinians were reconciled in\r\nsignificant ways as a result of the Camp David\r\nconversations. President Clinton, for his perseverance,\r\nPrime Minister Barak and President Arafat, for their\r\nawareness of history and their common acceptance of\r\ntheir shared responsibility to the future, deserve\r\nencouragement and the firmest support in their effort to\r\nconclude this historic process. I am convinced that the\r\nresources of this dialogue have not been exhausted.\r\nThere is an opportunity to achieve, within the next few\r\nweeks, a framework agreement. It must remain clear\r\nthat the willingness to cooperate has been firmly\r\nestablished. This willingness will be seconded by the\r\nwillingness of the international community, and of\r\nEurope in particular, to offer its support to the\r\nestablishment of peace and to the reconstruction\r\nefforts.\r\nThe sculpting of the role of the United Nations,\r\nthe shape of its future work, will be a complex and\r\ndemanding task if we expect the Organization to escape\r\nits current fragility and affirm its responsibility. But\r\nperhaps we can rely increasingly on the vast experience\r\nthat has been gained during past actions. The\r\ndevelopment of this collection of experiences requires\r\nincreasing internal cohesion. The responsibility for the\r\ndevelopment of this cohesion falls on the\r\nOrganizations Members. This is the objective we must\r\nset for ourselves. The willingness to cooperate must\r\nlead to the elaboration of healthy administrative and\r\nfinancial structures, as well as to balanced relations\r\nbetween the principal organs, none of which should be\r\nexempt from periodic reform.\r\nToday the United Nations cannot be said to be in\r\na position to meet these criteria. Therefore, is it not\r\nindispensable that its Members pay their assessments\r\nwithout delay or conditions, and in full?\r\nThe fact that the Security Council is not being\r\nreformed and the distance between the Council and the\r\nvast majority of General Assembly members does not\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\ncontribute to the effectiveness of the Organization. The\r\nbridges that the United Nations will try to construct\r\nshould include, in order to seek greater unity of action,\r\na reinvigorated relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and a duly enlarged Security Council.\r\nThe United Nations will be put to the test. As a\r\nresult of the pursuit of globalization the Organization\r\nwill be in demand. Will it be capable of meeting the\r\nchallenge and of responding in a way that will put the\r\nOrganization at the centre of the major international\r\ndiscussions? Even after the Millennium Summit it\r\nwould be rash to claim that this question is closed.\r\nLuxembourg hopes that it will be possible to respond\r\npositively, and Luxembourg reaffirms its willingness to\r\ncooperate so that we can proceed together in this\r\ndirection.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Somsavat Lengsavad, the Deputy Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao Peoples\r\nDemocratic Republic.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao Peoples Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in Laotian; English text furnished by\r\nthe delegation): At the outset, I would like, on behalf\r\nof the delegation of the Lao Peoples Democratic\r\nRepublic, to congratulate you, Sir, on your well-\r\ndeserved election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\r\nour Assembly stands to gain a great deal from your\r\nable leadership and from your wide knowledge of\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nthe outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the\r\nguidance he provided to the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe twentieth century has been an epoch of great\r\ntechnological and scientific discoveries and\r\nachievements. This is indeed one of the positive things\r\nabout the past century that we all can be proud of.\r\nHowever, this same past century has brought enormous\r\ncalamities and left manifold complex problems as we\r\nenter the twenty-first century.\r\nCertainly, we have to accept the responsibility for\r\nresolving them and in order to succeed in addressing\r\nthis daunting task, we must lay down sound basic\r\nfoundations aimed at encouraging and building peace\r\nand international cooperation for development. This is\r\nthe lofty goal of our new age that we should all strive\r\nto achieve.\r\nIn preparation for the new millennium, a number\r\nof international conferences were held on different\r\nissues under the auspices of the United Nations, such\r\nas the World Summit for Children in New York, the\r\nEarth Summit in Rio, the World Social Summit in\r\nCopenhagen, the World Conference on Women in\r\nBeijing, UNCTAD X in Bangkok and other\r\ninternational conferences of equal importance. The\r\nmain objectives of those assemblies were to solve the\r\nmultifaceted problems that have occurred in the world,\r\nwith the hope that the new millennium will face\r\nminimal risk in every area and that humankind will\r\nconcentrate its intelligence and resources on\r\ndeveloping the economy, civilized culture and\r\nprosperity in equality, in a just and peaceful\r\nenvironment free from violent confrontation, with\r\nconcern for poverty, disease and others. However, the\r\nobjectives set forth by these conferences have not lived\r\nup to our expectations. In addition, new challenges that\r\nare far more complex have erupted in the light of\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe South Summit of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nwhich was held in Havana in April this year, rightly\r\nidentified the positive and negative sides of\r\nglobalization and put forward a collective guideline for\r\nfuture action. The conference was of the view that the\r\nunsolved problems are the well-known issues of the\r\ngrowing debt, the unfavourable world trade measures\r\nimposed on goods from the developing countries  in\r\nparticular, the least developed ones  as well as\r\nhuman resources that have not yet been developed to\r\ncope with new technologies and others. Overall, all\r\nthese issues need to be seriously dealt with together\r\nbetween the North and the South, so as to meet the\r\nchallenges and make use of favourable opportunities\r\nthat will lead to a North-South cooperation based on\r\nequality and mutual interest, as explicitly expressed in\r\nthe Havana Declaration.\r\nThe achievements of humankind in the past\r\ncentury are of immense value. We believe that, if these\r\nachievements are correctly used, happiness and\r\nprosperity will be brought to the new generation of the\r\nnext century. Nonetheless, we are still yet concerned\r\nover the challenges that the new generation has to face.\r\nToday many young girls and boys worldwide have not\r\nenjoyed happy lives and lacked opportunity for\r\neducation. Moreover, they are subject to exploitation\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nfor the purpose of pornography, prostitution and drug\r\naddiction, that destroy their own future, their families,\r\nthe society and, subsequently, becomes the source of\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nSimilarly, the gender issue is also of great\r\nimportance. Although equality between women and\r\nmen is respected and womens participation in social\r\nlife has increased, poverty and violence continue to be\r\nthe major obstacles that affect womens life. To\r\nsuccessfully tackle this problem, countries around the\r\nworld should help each other and devote the necessary\r\nresources to this domain.\r\nDrug abuse continues to be a subject of major\r\nconcern for the international community. In the Lao\r\nPeoples Democratic Republic, the Lao Government\r\nhas implemented, with the cooperation and assistance\r\nof friendly countries and international organizations \r\nin particular the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme  a number of projects with a\r\nview to remedying the effects of drug abuse.\r\nExperience has shown that people involved in poppy\r\ncultivation continue to remain poor. Therefore, in order\r\nto definitely solve this problem, it is imperative to\r\ncarry out alternative development projects, ensure food\r\nsecurity, enable people to earn more by cultivating\r\ncrops other than poppies, as well as traditional\r\ncultivation. The Lao Government is determined to\r\ncontinue its efforts in drug control and supervision. It\r\nis our hope that the international community will lend a\r\nstrong helping hand in order to help us to overcome our\r\ndifficulties as soon as possible for the bright future of\r\nour children.\r\nWhile the world is entering the new millennium,\r\na number of regional conflicts have been satisfactorily\r\nsettled, thus responding to the aspirations of the\r\naffected nations. However, at the same time, many\r\nother regional conflicts remain unsolved and continue\r\nto cause pain and suffering to the people directly\r\ninvolved.\r\nIn the Middle East, durable peace has not been\r\nensured: the inalienable national and fundamental\r\nrights of the Palestinian people have not yet been\r\nexercised. We welcome the resumption of peace\r\nnegotiations between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization. The two parties should seize\r\nthis opportunity to write a new page of history based\r\non peaceful coexistence and economic cooperation\r\namong the peoples in the region. In this perspective,\r\nwe look forward to seeing the establishment of an\r\nindependent Palestinian State and of respect for an\r\nexistence of all States in the region, thus ensuring\r\ndurable peace and cooperation between the nations, in\r\nparticular between the Arab States and Israel.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\napplied against the Republic of Cuba continues to\r\ncause enormous difficulties and damage to the Cuban\r\npeople. In compliance with the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe General Assembly, we urge that an end be put to\r\nthis restrictive commercial practice, which runs counter\r\nto the principles of the Charter, international law and\r\nthe present world trend.\r\nThe Lao Peoples Democratic Republic is\r\nfollowing closely the situation in the Korean peninsula.\r\nWe welcome the outcome of the Korean Summit\r\nbetween Chairman Kim Jong 11 of the National\r\nDefense Commission of the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea and President Kim Dae Jung of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, who met in Pyongyang last June\r\nand laid down an important foundation in response to\r\nthe aspirations of the Korean people for the peaceful\r\nreunification of Korea and the settlement of the\r\nproblems in the Korean peninsula through peaceful\r\nnegotiations, which contributed thereby to the\r\npromotion of peace, stability and cooperation in the\r\nregion.\r\nOn 2 December 2000, the Lao Peoples\r\nDemocratic Republic will commemorate its twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary. Over this period, the Lao people have\r\nupheld the spirit of patriotism, self-sufficiency, and\r\nstrength and have attracted assistance and cooperation\r\nfrom the international community. They have made\r\ntremendous accomplishments in national construction.\r\nAs a result, their living standard has gradually\r\nimproved. The most outstanding achievement, attained\r\nfor the first time in the countrys history, is that we\r\nhave reached self-sufficiency in rice production and\r\neven have a surplus for export. The socio-economic\r\ninfrastructure has been continuously expanded, the\r\nState is governed by the rule of law and freedom and\r\ndemocracy are respected and constantly promoted. The\r\nsolidarity of the Lao people of all ethnic groups has\r\nbeen further strengthened. These are all fundamental\r\nfactors in ensuring political stability and social order.\r\nThanks to the policy of renewal consistent with the\r\nmechanisms of the market economy, the development\r\nof the peoples right to self-determination and an open-\r\ndoor policy in our international relations, we are\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nconvinced that the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic\r\nwill be able to emerge from underdevelopment in the\r\nnear future.\r\nGlobalization has had an uneven impact on the\r\ndevelopment of every country, because each nation is\r\nat a different stage in the development process. While\r\nsome developing economies are making use of the\r\nincreasing economic opportunities, a large number of\r\ndeveloping countries continue to be marginalized and\r\nare therefore not in a position to benefit from this\r\nprocess. Most countries in the developing world\r\ncontinue to face problems of access to markets, capital\r\nand technology. Many are obliged to undertake painful\r\nstructural reforms that are not compatible with their\r\nrealities and have an undesirable negative impact that\r\nimpedes their integration into the world economy.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, there is a need to build a\r\nfavourable environment that would enable the\r\ndeveloping countries to compete in the world trading\r\nsystem and to fully benefit from globalization. The\r\nUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in helping to\r\nmake this happen.\r\nAs we bid farewell to the twentieth century,\r\nhumanity is still yearning for a world of peace, a world\r\nfree from want and misery, a world governed by\r\ninternational relations based on respect for the national\r\nsovereignty of States, cooperation for development and\r\npeaceful coexistence between peoples. The\r\ninternational community is therefore duty-bound to\r\nincrease its cooperation in all possible areas so as to\r\nensure that the objectives of the United Nations\r\nSummit Declaration are achieved and to bring benefits\r\nto peoples throughout the world, as well as guarantees\r\nto new generations of a better life and a more\r\nprosperous future. In this spirit, I wish the present\r\nsession great success.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Paskal Milo, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Albania.\r\nMr. Milo (Albania): Allow me to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly, and to express my strong conviction that,\r\nunder your guidance, the work of this session will be\r\nconducted successfully. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to express my great appreciation for the\r\nwork carried out by your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, and for his competent guidance of the\r\nprevious session.\r\nAt the start of the new millennium, Albania, as a\r\nsovereign and peace-loving country, is committed to\r\nmaking its modest contribution, in the activities of the\r\ncommunity of countries Members of the United\r\nNations, to greater peace, stability, security and\r\neconomic prosperity. It has tried to do so by creating\r\ninternal political and economic stability, as well as by\r\npursuing a foreign policy aimed at achieving\r\nconstructive cooperation with the countries of South-\r\nEastern Europe and beyond. Since last years session,\r\nAlbania has been taking further steps towards\r\nconsolidating its democratic institutions and\r\nconstitutional order, strengthening and liberalizing its\r\neconomy and consolidating and ensuring respect for\r\nhuman rights. Because of the efficient measures\r\nundertaken by the Albanian Government, and thanks to\r\nthe help provided by our partners, Albania is\r\nrecovering from the consequences of last years\r\nconflict in Kosovo.\r\nAlbania has become an open and safe country for\r\nforeign investment. The policies of the Albanian\r\nGovernment to privatize strategic sectors and absorb\r\nforeign capital are bearing fruit. The strengthening of\r\nsecurity and public order, as well as the fight against\r\norganized crime, have reached satisfactory levels that\r\nare appreciated not only within my country, but\r\nelsewhere. The abrogation of the death penalty and the\r\nestablishment of the office of Ombudsman have further\r\nraised the level of protection of and respect for human\r\nrights in Albania.\r\nAlbania is currently on the eve of local elections,\r\nwhich will be of fundamental importance for the future\r\ndevelopment of the country  not because of the\r\nresults so much as because of the way in which the\r\nelections will be conducted. For this reason, the\r\nAlbanian Government, in close cooperation with\r\nspecialized international institutions, such as the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nthe Council of Europe, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and others, has made every\r\neffort to ensure that these elections are fair, free and\r\ndemocratic.\r\nAlbania has clearly expressed its intention to play\r\na primary and constructive role in the common\r\nattempts to transform the Balkans into a developed and\r\nstable region, clearly aiming at European integration.\r\nThe policy of good-neighbourliness is not simply a\r\nrequirement of geography but, above all, an eloquent\r\nexpression of goodwill and mutual interest in the\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nprotection of democratic institutions, fundamental\r\nfreedoms, stability and prosperity in the region.\r\nConsequently, the Albanian Government has proceeded\r\ntowards the creation of stable relations of mutual\r\ncooperation with Balkan countries, considering that to\r\nbe a primary strategy for future European integration.\r\nRelations with these countries have been\r\ninstitutionalized not only bilaterally, but also\r\nmultilaterally. Albania has placed at the core of these\r\nrelations common economic, political and security\r\ninterests, as well as respect for human freedoms and\r\nrights, including those of national minorities living in\r\nthe territory of the Republic of Albania. It has tried to\r\nmake inter-Balkan relations follow the model of\r\nexisting relations among European Union member\r\ncountries, with the free movement of people, goods and\r\ncapital.\r\nMore than a year after the bloody conflict in\r\nKosovo that endangered peace and stability in the\r\nregion, the Albanian Government is of the opinion that\r\nthe situation in Kosovo has improved significantly\r\nsince the beginning of the implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999)  the deployment of\r\nthe Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations administration. Hundreds of thousands\r\nof refugees have returned home, houses destroyed by\r\nthe war have been rebuilt, the reconstruction of the\r\neconomy and of the common administration\r\ninstitutions has begun and the political situation and\r\norder in the country have improved significantly.\r\nThe current situation in Kosovo contradicts the\r\nsceptical and nihilistic opinions, expressed here and\r\nthere, against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and against\r\nthe establishment of the United Nations administration\r\nthere. Our memories of what happened in Kosovo a\r\nyear ago will not fade, but will make us more\r\nconscious of the catastrophic consequences that the\r\nchauvinistic policy of a totalitarian regime can bring to\r\nan innocent civilian population.\r\nIn order to make a contribution to the founding of\r\na democratic society in Kosovo in which human and\r\nnational rights are fully respected, we have established\r\nvery close relations with the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo, KFOR and their\r\nrepresentatives. Albanians, even more than other\r\npeople in the region, wish for and will welcome the\r\ndemocratization of Serbia, because, historically, they\r\nhave suffered more than others from Serbian\r\nnationalism. Often, however, wishes do not match up\r\nwith reality, and we have to be realistic.\r\nFollowing very attentively the preparations for\r\nlocal elections in Kosovo, the Albanian Government\r\nexpresses its conviction that the political forces in\r\nKosovo will conduct their pre-electoral campaign in\r\naccordance with democratic principles and values,\r\nwithout acts of political violence. We would also like\r\nto express our sincere will for the full participation of\r\nthe Serb community and of the other minorities in\r\nKosovo in this electoral process because, as we have\r\npreviously stated, we support a multi-ethnic and\r\nmulticultural Kosovo.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to appeal to\r\nthe entire international community to apply stronger\r\npressure against the Milosević regime in order to force\r\nhim to release all 7,000 Albanian political prisoners\r\nand hostages being kept in the Serb prisons, to help\r\nbring the criminals who caused the massacres against\r\nthe Kosovar population before the United Nations\r\nTribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, to\r\nstrengthen the international police presence and to\r\nwork on strengthening judicial bodies in order to detect\r\nany kind of crime in Kosovo and combat it.\r\nI would also like to reiterate that the realization\r\nof United Nations goals for the fulfilment of the\r\npromises to start the reconstruction of the Kosovar\r\neconomy is of special importance. It should be\r\nincluded in regional cooperation projects, especially in\r\nthe framework of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\nAlthough the Balkan political scenery has\r\nchanged, and the countries of the region are engaged in\r\na process of cooperation, there still exists a source of\r\ntension and conflict in the region, a source that has\r\nconsequences for the countries of the region and\r\nbeyond. It is Milosevićs regime. He was not satisfied\r\nby the catastrophic 10-year-long conflicts that he\r\npersonally set off in the former Yugoslavia; now he is\r\ndestroying Serbia itself, as well as the remaining\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nNext week, presidential and parliamentary\r\nelections will be held in Serbia. The current situation\r\nthere indicates that very little chance exists for them to\r\nbe free and fair. The recent amendments to the\r\nYugoslav Constitution, the brutal violence against the\r\nopposition and the student movement and the\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\ncensorship and closing down of independent media are\r\nexplicit facts proving that Milosević may transform\r\nthese elections into a tool for illegally maintaining\r\npower.\r\nLike all the rest of the international community,\r\nthe Albanian Government looks forward to genuine\r\ndemocratic forces coming into power in Serbia, forces\r\nthat possess new visions for the future of their country\r\nand of the whole region.\r\nTaking advantage of this opportunity, I would like\r\nto thank Mr. Kouchner, the Special Representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General, for the positive developments in\r\nKosovo and for all that he and his staff are doing to\r\nstabilize Kosovo and to establish democratic\r\ninstitutions there.\r\nAs a neighbouring country, Albania closely\r\nfollows developments in Montenegro. It condemns\r\nMilosevićs attempts to destabilize that Republic and to\r\nundermine the democratic and integrative processes\r\nthat are being undertaken by the legitimate\r\nMontenegrin leadership. Following the good-\r\nneighbourliness principle of its foreign policy, the\r\nAlbanian Government has recently developed\r\nintensively its cooperation with Montenegro. Current\r\nrelations have reached the highest level ever known,\r\nhaving been extended to areas of mutual interest, such\r\nas political, economic and trade cooperation, the free\r\nmovement of people and so forth. It is our intention to\r\nfurther extend and strengthen these relations in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe countries in our region are involved in an\r\nalready irreversible process: Euro-Atlantic integration.\r\nNot only the Balkans, but also Western Europe, is now\r\naware of the danger stemming from a divided Europe,\r\nof the danger stemming from a Balkan region that is\r\nnot integrated into the European Union. The regional\r\nconflicts of the last decade are more than sufficient to\r\nunderstand this tendency. Stability in the Balkans is not\r\nonly in the interest of its countries, but also in the\r\ninterest of the European Union itself. An economically\r\ndeveloped and democratically consolidated Balkans\r\ncannot exist without a Europeanized Balkans. The\r\nEuropean integration of the Balkans and its\r\ndevelopment consist of an inseparable unity. It is of no\r\nimportance whether a country tries to protect its\r\ndemocratic institutions, laws, public order or respect\r\nhuman rights; it can never attain the desired success if\r\nit is not economically developed.\r\nWe are conscious that European integration is not\r\nan easy process; on the contrary, it is a long and\r\ndifficult path. Before being integrated into the\r\nEuropean Union, all the countries of our region should\r\nfirst be integrated among themselves, and existing\r\nsocieties in the Balkans should demonstrate and reflect\r\nthe best features of European civilization. In order to\r\nachieve this, we should first combat and overcome\r\nextreme nationalistic concepts, mentalities and\r\npolicies, because Europeanization means\r\ncooperation, tolerance and integration.\r\nThe end of the conflict in Kosovo marked a\r\nturning point for the future of the Balkans. The\r\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe was the best\r\nresponse to the crisis in the region. Our countries, like\r\nthe European Union member countries, consider this\r\ninitiative an instrument and a bridge for the integration\r\nof South-Eastern Europe into the European structures.\r\nThe Albanian Government regards the implementation\r\nof the Stability Pact as one of its main priorities.\r\nAlbania is highly appreciated by its international\r\npartners for the engagement and the responsibility it\r\nhas shown in drafting the feasibility studies for the\r\nStability Pact projects. We hope that the strong\r\npolitical will expressed in Sarajevo last year at the end\r\nof the Kosovo conflict will be vigorously followed by\r\nthe will to finalize financial support for the rapid\r\nimplementation of the Stability Pact projects.\r\nAlbanias achievements in its domestic and\r\nforeign policy in the year 2000 have only one goal: its\r\nfurther integration within Euro-Atlantic structures. The\r\nAlbanian people have a clear European orientation, and\r\nthat is why all Albanian Governments of the last 10\r\nyears have enjoyed their total support for their\r\nEuropean integration policy. The present Albanian\r\nGovernment, representing and expressing the will of\r\nthe people, has continuously fulfilled all the required\r\nconditions during the last year, aiming at reaching a\r\nhigher level of relations with the European Union. We\r\nhope that in the near future the institutions of the\r\nEuropean Union will approve the status report that the\r\nAlbanian Government presented at Brussels several\r\nmonths ago. This approval will pave the way for the\r\nbeginning of negotiations to reach Albanias\r\nassociation and stability agreement with the European\r\nUnion. Albanias acceptance in the World Trade\r\nOrganization in July this year was also an encouraging\r\nand very optimistic event in this respect.\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nThe Albanian Government has welcomed the\r\ninitiative of President Chirac to organize, on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, a regional summit in Zagreb in\r\nNovember this year. It is another affirmation of\r\ncommon efforts to further advance the democratization\r\nand integration processes in the region and the\r\nconsolidation of security and stability there.\r\nThe new century has started. We should keep on\r\nfacing old problems, along with our new challenges.\r\nSome of those may be local crises, organized crime,\r\ntraffic in human beings, terrorism, arms control and so\r\nforth, all of which require practical and well-oriented\r\ncooperation. Bitter experiences in various regions of\r\nthe world, such as the Balkans, Africa, South-East Asia\r\nand so forth, made the role of such organizations as the\r\nUnited Nations, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe and others more evident. On the\r\nother hand, the world has entered the era of\r\nglobalization. Despite its positive side, globalization is\r\nunavoidably accompanied by effects that may bring\r\nnegative consequences, especially to small and poor\r\ncountries. In order to avoid these consequences, it is\r\nnecessary to compile and to implement global\r\nstrategies, and the United Nations can easily do that.\r\nOnly a week has passed since one of the most\r\ndistinguished events for the international community,\r\nthe Millennium Summit. It was a unique meeting of all\r\nthe leaders of the world, where they affirmed their\r\ngoodwill to cooperate in facing the challenges of the\r\nnew millennium and in strengthening the United\r\nNations. The Albanian Government hails the results of\r\nthe Summit and expresses its conviction that all United\r\nNations Member countries should unite all their forces\r\nfor the fulfilment of the commitments embodied in the\r\nfinal Declaration of the Summit. Following is what the\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, wrote in his report:\r\nWe must do more than talk about our\r\nfuture, however. We must start to create it.\r\n(A/54/2000, para. 17)\r\nIt is time to take concrete steps in this direction.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Brunei Darussalam, His Royal\r\nHighness Prince Mohamed Bolkiah.\r\nPrince Mohamed Bolkiah (Brunei Darussalam):\r\nMr. President, I should like to offer you my\r\ncongratulations on your election and my best wishes\r\nfor the coming year, and also to convey my great\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, for his fine work and guidance over the past\r\nyear.\r\nI would like to start by thanking our Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report to the Millennium Summit. It is\r\ncomprehensive, ethical and most impressive. We have\r\nnever had anything like it before. One effect it has had\r\nis to give deep meaning to the expression the\r\ninternational community. I think that in the past, we\r\nhave often used this term far too lightly. Now we know\r\nwhat it stands for. It is spelled out in the final\r\nDeclaration made by our heads of Government, which\r\nis now a textbook for the coming year. Its great ideas\r\nstill echo in this Hall, and its noble aims light up the\r\nfuture.\r\nIn our view, it has given precise targets that can\r\ntruly help developing nations. For the first time, we can\r\ndistinguish clearly between immediate issues and long-\r\nterm ones. This is very important, because many of the\r\nthings on which we spend so much time and so many\r\nresources are not, in fact, todays issues. They are sad\r\nlegacies passed on by the twentieth century.\r\nObviously, they are important. Each one is tragic\r\nin the consequences it has for ordinary peoples lives.\r\nBut they are all primarily the responsibility of\r\nGovernments and regional organizations. The more\r\nthey dominate the affairs of the United Nations, the\r\nmore they stop us from concentrating on the deep-\r\nseated problems of developing nations. Those problems\r\nare the ones that can truly be called todays issues. As\r\nthe Secretary-General highlighted in his Summit report,\r\nthey are becoming very serious indeed. We have even\r\nhad to give them a new name: transnational issues.\r\nThey each have academic titles: technological\r\nproblems; demographic problems; socio-economic\r\nproblems; and environmental problems. But take away\r\nthe grand language, and they all add up to a simple\r\nfact: they are far too big for individual Governments to\r\ndeal with, or even regional organizations.\r\nIt is all too clear that they will not be solved in\r\nthe marketplace, either. The solutions will not trickle\r\ndown. In fact, the global market economy has\r\nlengthened their list and created its own set of special\r\nproblems.\r\nIt would all be very depressing indeed but for one\r\nthing. The Summit Declaration has clearly invited us\r\nall, as Members of the United Nations, to accept a joint\r\ninternational responsibility to find solutions. Naturally,\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nwe may differ on how to go about it, but what is most\r\nimportant is that we have to recognize and accept the\r\nneed for new priorities. Consequently, we highly value\r\nthe assessment made by the Secretary-General of\r\nwhere these lie.\r\nFor example, we appreciate his timely advice that\r\nglobalization requires policies and measures that are\r\nsensitive to the needs of developing nations. We are\r\npleased that he has upheld the peoples right to\r\ndevelopment as fundamental. We join him in\r\nrecognizing the special concern of our friends and\r\ncolleagues on the African continent. We support all that\r\nhe is trying to do to improve the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations, because this\r\nshould enable it to concentrate on what it does best and\r\nis best equipped to do.\r\nBy this I mean the practical, urgent work done by\r\nits organs and agencies and its professionals and\r\nvolunteers, in the field, close to the people. Much of\r\nthis represents development in areas such as education\r\nand training, which are absolutely critical if the people\r\nof developing nations are to move beyond a day-to-day\r\nstruggle for basic food, shelter and medicine and take\r\npart successfully in the new global economy.\r\nIt means that the work of agencies such as the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), the United Nations\r\nChildrens Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) is vital. It needs to proceed\r\nurgently and not be held back because essential funds\r\nare diverted to solving ancient problems.\r\nThe vital tasks of the United Nations today\r\nshould not be held hostage by the twentieth century. It\r\nhas urgent new work to undertake for developing\r\nnations. This work can be simply summed up. It is to\r\nensure that the phrase developing nations actually\r\ndoes mean nations that are developing  rather than\r\nwhat they too often tend to be, just a polite expression\r\nfor the very opposite.\r\nThe Summit Declaration offers us all the chance\r\nto do just this, in friendship and cooperation, and I\r\nhope that we will do everything we can to implement\r\nits provisions. It would be the best form of appreciation\r\nwe could offer to the Secretary-General and his staff at\r\nthe end of a remarkable years work.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Angola, His Excellency Mr. João\r\nBernardo de Miranda.\r\nMr. Miranda (Angola): Allow me to begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government\r\nand on my own behalf, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI also wish to congratulate, in particular, the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the wise\r\nand dynamic manner in which he carried out his\r\nmandate. I would also like to express our appreciation\r\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfish\r\nefforts to make the United Nations an increasingly\r\neffective instrument, capable of dealing with the\r\ndemands of our times and finding and implementing\r\nsolutions for the most pressing problems of the world.\r\nJust a few days ago, during the Millennium\r\nSummit, the leaders of the world defined the priorities\r\nof the United Nations for the twenty-first century and\r\nexpressed the need to adapt its structure for the\r\ndemands and challenges of the future. During that\r\nevent of transcendental importance for the lives of the\r\npeople of this planet, the indispensable and\r\nirreplaceable character of the United Nations in\r\ninternational relations was reaffirmed. Member States\r\nreiterated their promise to maintain and preserve the\r\nUnited Nations as a privileged mechanism for\r\ninternational dialogue and cooperation in the name of\r\npeace and well-being of all peoples.\r\nIndeed, given the role of the United Nations as\r\nguarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples, it is\r\nurgent that we begin the implementation of actions\r\naimed at adapting its internal structure to new world\r\nrealities. This will permit the Organization to deal\r\nrapidly and effectively with the main problems of the\r\nworld and avoid having its members resort to solutions\r\noutside the established framework of its main\r\norgans  namely, the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn recent years, the United Nations sought,\r\nthrough world summits, to find global solutions with\r\nbroad international consensus for the many misfortunes\r\nthat afflict humanity, such as local wars, degradation of\r\nthe environment, violations of human rights and\r\ninadequate social development, among others. Various\r\nplans of action were outlined. However, the problems\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nthey sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many have\r\neven become worse.\r\nA revision of the mechanism for implementing\r\ndecisions is needed, through a revitalization and\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system,\r\nparticularly that of its principal bodies, such as the\r\nSecurity Council. From our point of view, that body\r\nrequires greater internal democracy, and its\r\ncomposition should reflect the current membership in\r\nthe Organization and its geographic diversity. We think\r\nthat, in this way, its decision-making would be faster\r\nand its performance in the area of peacekeeping and\r\ninternational security more effective.\r\nThe persistence of a climate of insecurity and\r\ninstability in a number of regions of the world cannot\r\nbe attributed solely to internal causes; it also stems\r\nfrom weakness in the international security system. A\r\nreflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist, for\r\nexample, in the early warning system and in the\r\npeacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have not\r\nalways corresponded to the desired objectives, either\r\nbecause the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not\r\nsent in a timely manner, or because at times, they are\r\nnot provided with adequate human, material and\r\nfinancial resources. Sometimes this is due to the\r\nambiguity in the mission mandate itself.\r\nWe recognize that the effectiveness of action in\r\nthe area of peace and international security does not\r\ndepend only on United Nations activities. There has to\r\nbe renewed commitment on the part of each and every\r\nState. On this matter, I would like to applaud the recent\r\npublication of the Brahimi report.\r\nIt is our understanding that the adoption of\r\nmeasures at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels should be made part of this commitment in order\r\nto eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. In\r\nthe particular case of the African continent, the\r\ncontinent most affected by the scourge of war, the\r\nillicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source of\r\nsupport for wars incited by some rebel groups with the\r\nobjective of overturning democratically elected\r\nregimes. Some new initiatives have been launched with\r\nthe aim of reducing access of these conflict\r\ndiamonds to the international market. My Government\r\nsupports these initiatives and will provide any\r\ncooperation necessary for their implementation.\r\nAnother serious issue affecting international\r\nsecurity is the circulation and transfer of small arms\r\nthat flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups.\r\nThis takes place with the connivance of certain\r\nGovernments and networks of transnational organized\r\ncrime. The lack of international legal instruments\r\ncapable of controlling transactions of these arms is\r\nstimulating the creation of actual arms markets, above\r\nall in Africa. This is leading to an increased number of\r\nconflicts and making their resolution even more\r\ndifficult. According to United Nations data, the effects\r\nof these arms on civil populations are shocking. They\r\nhave already resulted in more deaths than the two\r\nworld wars combined. In fact, the issue of conflict\r\ndiamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumes\r\nspecial importance for Angola. It is through the sale of\r\nillegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by Jonas\r\nSavimbi reconstituted their war machine, with which\r\nthey then undertook a large-scale military campaign\r\naimed at taking power. That war campaign led to a\r\nprocession of death and destruction, and it is the\r\nprincipal reason for the economic instability in Angola.\r\nThis scenario is repeating itself in other regions of\r\nAfrica and the world. For this reason, a solution is\r\nurgently required.\r\nThe economic and social development and\r\nsubsequent eradication of poverty, full respect for\r\nhuman rights, democracy and good governance can\r\nonly be achieved in absolute conditions of peace and\r\nstability. It is in this context that my Government\r\nestablished, as a priority, the restoration of definitive\r\npeace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain this\r\nobjective, the general situation in Angola has\r\nsignificantly improved. It is for this reason that today\r\nwe are more confident than ever of a future of peace,\r\ndevelopment and prosperity.\r\nIndeed, the war has ceased to have the same\r\nintensity as it did several years ago, and the conflict\r\nitself is moving progressively towards an end. The\r\npolitical and military measures undertaken by the\r\nGovernment have significantly reduced the ability of\r\nthe rebels to wage war. These measures have also\r\nallowed the Government to resume control over nearly\r\nthe entire country.\r\nMore than 12,000 rebel military personnel have\r\nabandoned their arms and joined the efforts of\r\nreconstruction and national reconciliation. Those who\r\npersist in waging war have less and less space, and\r\ntheir activities are limited today to isolated armed\r\nattacks against civilian targets, the objective being to\r\ndestroy and loot the peoples property.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nThe military measures undertaken by the\r\nGovernment represent a necessary and legitimate\r\nrecourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by the\r\nrebels of UNITA, which put in jeopardy the very\r\nexistence of the Angolan democratic system. However,\r\ndespite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at the\r\ntotal control of our national borders and the elimination\r\nof the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups are\r\nhaving a positive impact in the search for peace, they\r\ndo not constitute our only option for the resolution of\r\narmed conflict.\r\nSimultaneously, we will continue to implement\r\nother actions aimed at guaranteeing the total\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which for us\r\ncontinues to be a valid basis for the resolution of the\r\nAngolan problem. In this context, we reiterate our\r\nreadiness to continue to integrate in our society all\r\nthose who choose to abandon the option of war.\r\nThe international community, and the United\r\nNations in particular, still has an active role to play in\r\nthe process of restoring peace in Angola, through the\r\ncontinued implementation and strengthening of\r\nsanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.\r\nThe recent nomination by the Secretary-General\r\nof the members of the mechanism to monitor the\r\napplication of sanctions against the UNITA rebels, in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1295\r\n(2000), will contribute to greater international\r\nvigilance regarding possible violations. It will deny\r\nbases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. We\r\nhope that all Members of the United Nations will\r\nextend their cooperation to that body.\r\nThe significant improvement of the situation in\r\nAngola, however, has not brought an immediate end to\r\nthe effects of war on the lives of the people. The\r\nhumanitarian situation continues to be critical, and for\r\nthat reason we appeal to the international community to\r\nincrease its assistance to the needy populations.\r\nThe positive evolution of the situation is not\r\nlimited to the politico-military field; it has also carried\r\nover into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continues\r\non the path of economic reforms which have earned the\r\nconfidence of international financial institutions. This\r\nprogress translated to the recent signature of an\r\nagreement with the International Monetary Fund\r\nrelating to the implementation of a monitored\r\nprogramme.\r\nWe hope that the international community will\r\ncontribute substantially through the investment of\r\ncapital during the recovery phase of the Angolan\r\neconomy in supporting stability and growth. Angola\r\nadopted legislation to protect foreign investment by\r\nproviding incentives and guarantees.\r\nThe international situation continues to be\r\ncharacterized by violence and tension in various parts\r\nof the world; they constitute a serious threat to peace\r\nand stability. Angola is seriously concerned by the\r\ncontinuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo in view of the grave repercussions for\r\nstability and development in the central region of\r\nAfrica. The situation in that neighbouring country,\r\nwhich shares more than 2,000 kilometres of common\r\nborder with Angola, remains quite volatile and\r\ncomplex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening if\r\nappropriate measures are not taken.\r\nThe resolution of the Congolese conflict must\r\ncome about, fundamentally, through the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In\r\nspite of its shortcomings, which perhaps call for a new\r\nreading, it continues to be the only basis acceptable to\r\nall the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. Invading forces should withdraw completely\r\nfrom Congolese territory and cease immediately their\r\nsupport for the destabilization of that country.\r\nThese conditions, in addition to the inter-\r\nCongolese dialogue, founded on a realistic base\r\nincluding the unequivocal recognition of the authority\r\nof the Government in Kinshasa, will be crucial for the\r\nsuccess of the peace process. Angola reiterates its\r\ncommitment to continue to make the necessary efforts,\r\ntogether with the mediator, President Frederick Chiluba\r\nof Zambia, and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement,\r\nuntil a way out of the conflict is found.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, the prosecution of hostilities\r\ncontinues to delay the pacification of the country.\r\nAngola supports regional initiatives aimed at\r\nreactivating the peace process and condemns the\r\nattacks against United Nations personnel and forces.\r\nWe support steps aimed at bringing to international\r\njustice the principal parties responsible for the\r\natrocities committed against the people of that country.\r\nIn Somalia, the progress reached at the national\r\nconference led to the re-establishment of some national\r\ninstitutions and moved the country closer to peace.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nAngola encourages the continuation of these efforts\r\nand hopes that in the near future Somalia may be able\r\nto reassume, de facto, its rightful place in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn the Horn of Africa, the conflict between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positive\r\nmovement following the signing of the Cessation of\r\nHostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the two\r\nparties honour their commitments under the accord and\r\ncreate conditions for the establishment of good-\r\nneighbourly relations and cooperation.\r\nSimilarly, we continue to be optimistic regarding\r\nthe resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara through\r\nthe implementation of the United Nations peace plan.\r\nAngola is following with particular attention the\r\nsituation in Zimbabwe, our fraternal country, and\r\nsupports the efforts of the Government of that country\r\nto find a just and fair solution to the land problem that\r\nwas inherited from the colonial period. In this context,\r\nwe share and fully support the position expressed by\r\nthe Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on land\r\nreform in Zimbabwe.\r\nIn the Middle East, the question of Palestine\r\nconstitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in the\r\nregion. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination. The resolution\r\nof this conflict must encompass a political compromise\r\nbetween the parties involved and the effective\r\nimplementation of relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions and other understandings reached.\r\nLess than a year ago, the people of East Timor\r\nfinally succeeded in exercising their right to self-\r\ndetermination. Angola feels pleased and compensated\r\nby this historic accomplishment, since it was one of the\r\ncountries that fought in the United Nations and other\r\ninternational forums for the right of the Timorese\r\npeople to freely choose their own destiny.\r\nThe international community, and the United\r\nNations in particular, which is responsible for the\r\nmanagement of the transition period, cannot permit the\r\ncurrent climate of violence, provoked by the militias\r\nwith the objective of impeding the independence of the\r\nterritory, to impose itself over the will of a people that\r\nhas already suffered for decades the scourge of\r\ncolonialism and foreign domination. Angola strongly\r\ncondemns these acts of violence, which have resulted\r\nin great loss of life, destruction and chaos. Angola\r\nappeals to the Security Council to take appropriate\r\nsteps to ensure its immediate cessation.\r\nIn the past two years, the world economy has\r\nregistered a clear recovery since the crisis that shook\r\nAsia. The industrial economies and the so-called\r\nemerging markets are becoming stronger and achieving\r\nconsiderable rates of growth. However, the present\r\nworld economic order continues to be marked by sharp\r\ndistortions between North and South. While the North\r\nenjoys unprecedented prosperity, the South continues\r\nto suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing to\r\nthese ills are restrictive economic measures imposed\r\nunilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is one\r\nexample  its principal victims are the most\r\nvulnerable strata of its population. We will continue to\r\nsupport the lifting of the embargo.\r\nThe international goal of reducing by one half, by\r\nthe year 2015, the percentage of the world population\r\nliving in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts,\r\nabove all by the wealthiest countries and international\r\nfinancial institutions. In particular, it will be necessary\r\nto relieve the burden of external debt, whose service\r\npayments alone absorb a large part of the financial\r\nresources of developing countries.\r\nAt the same time, steps will be necessary to\r\nattenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despite\r\nthe fact that it has strengthened the spirit of community\r\nin international economic relations, globalization has\r\nbenefited wealthy countries more than underdeveloped\r\ncountries. The structural adjustment programmes under\r\nway in many developing countries should take account\r\nof real necessities and specifics, because many of the\r\nmeasures imposed by the international financial\r\ninstitutions have caused serious difficulties, above all\r\nof a social nature.\r\nTo conclude my remarks, I would like to call\r\nattention to the need to pay more attention to the\r\neconomic situation of the African continent. This\r\nshould be done in such a way as to facilitate its\r\nintegration into the world market, particularly through\r\nthe transfer of technology and increasing productive\r\ninvestment.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Ms. María Eugenia Brizuela de Ávila,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of El Salvador.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nMs. Brizuela De Ávila (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): It is a source of great satisfaction for me to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, a former Prime Minister of\r\nFinland, on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, which\r\nfaithfully reflects your personal virtues and diplomatic\r\nexperience.\r\nI am also pleased to offer my most sincere\r\ncongratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNamibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his excellent work\r\nat the previous session, and in particular for his work to\r\ncoordinate the preparatory activities for the Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\nSpecial mention should be made of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his indefatigable work to\r\npromote the mandate of this Organization and for his\r\nvision for strengthening its future activities, set out in\r\nhis excellent report We, the peoples: the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century.\r\nWith regard to the situation in El Salvador, the\r\nprocess of implementing the peace agreements has\r\nbeen an exceptionally arduous and highly complex task\r\nthat has been made possible by the firm political will\r\nof the Government; by the willingness of the\r\nSalvadoran people and all the countrys political\r\nforces; and by national efforts that have enjoyed the\r\nvaluable cooperation of the international community, in\r\nparticular the group of friendly countries, which have\r\nalways remained close to us, and the United Nations,\r\nwhose verification work has contributed to the success\r\nof peace in El Salvador and to national reconciliation.\r\nWe are now entering a new phase of our history\r\nin which political and economic freedoms prevail. This\r\nwill ensure the continuity of a broader and deeper\r\nprocess requiring the cooperation and participation of\r\nall national sectors and the renewed support of the\r\ninternational community in consolidating the progress\r\nachieved and in making further advances towards more\r\nhumane and supportive forms of co-existence within\r\nthe framework imposed by our institutions and\r\ndemocratic Government.\r\nDuring this phase, we have opened up new\r\npossibilities and opportunities for all sectors of the\r\ncountry to benefit from peace in democracy and to\r\nmeet together the challenge of continuing to work to\r\nreduce existing disparities in our society, particularly\r\neconomic and social ones. In this vein, poverty in its\r\nvarious forms is and always has been a structural\r\nproblem, of which every country in the world is aware.\r\nIn our case, we are according it priority attention, not\r\nonly to ensure that these phenomena do not undermine\r\nour emerging democracy, which was won by our people\r\nwith so much pain and blood, but also so that we can\r\nassign it due support and social context.\r\nOn this basis, President Francisco Flores of El\r\nSalvador has focused his government plan on\r\nincreasing the levels of well-being and progress for all\r\nSalvadorans. He has concentrated his attention on the\r\nmost vulnerable and dispossessed sectors in order to\r\nimprove their quality of life through a policy to\r\ngenerate employment and job opportunities via\r\nenhanced productivity, the promotion of trade and\r\nincreased investments on the basis of shared\r\nresponsibility. As President Flores has already done in\r\nthis forum, I would emphasize the fact that the future\r\nof our nation is in our own hands. Each individual,\r\ngroup and sector of our society must assume its own\r\nresponsibilities and duties in order to overcome the\r\nproblems of and obstacles to the promotion of growth\r\nand sustainable human development.\r\nSimilarly, President Flores has emphasized the\r\nfact that in a globalized and interdependent world,\r\nsolidarity and international cooperation are vital to\r\ncomplement the efforts of the developing countries in\r\norder to face the global challenges jointly and with\r\ngreater capacity. It must be understood that this does\r\nnot mean that the international community, and the\r\nindustrialized countries in particular, are going to solve\r\nour problems, but rather that they can contribute to the\r\ncreation of an international environment that provides\r\nopportunities, including policies that offer greater\r\naccess to their markets for the products of developing\r\ncountries, investment opportunities, the transfer of\r\ntechnology and information, and fulfilling the\r\ncommitments made to improve development assistance.\r\nWe know that we are facing an enormous and\r\ncomplex task, and in this effort we hope that we can\r\ncontinue to rely on the valuable support of the\r\nmultilateral institutions and the community of nations,\r\nwith whom we share interests and problems  in\r\nparticular the joint mission to preserve and consolidate\r\npeace after conflicts have come to an end. In this\r\nregard, as we celebrate the International Year for the\r\nCulture of Peace, I would like to reiterate the\r\nimportance that El Salvador attaches to the continuity\r\nof the efforts focused on strengthening a culture of\r\npeace, especially on the eve of the International\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for\r\nthe Children of the World.\r\nIn Central America, since 1987, when the\r\nagreement on the Procedures for the establishment of\r\na firm and lasting peace in Central America was\r\nsigned, our peoples have welcomed with hope and have\r\nsupported national, regional and international\r\ninitiatives to achieve pacification in the region. These\r\nefforts culminated in specific agreements that made it\r\npossible to end the armed conflicts in the affected\r\ncountries and to carry out profound political and\r\ninstitutional transformations, which have contributed to\r\nimproving living conditions for all the peoples in the\r\nregion.\r\nAlong the way we have adopted and implemented\r\nmeasures and mechanisms that, in a general sense, have\r\nmade it possible to guarantee human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, establishing the base from\r\nwhich Central America can begin democratic life, free\r\nfrom armed conflicts and with legitimate and\r\nsovereignly elected Governments. These Governments,\r\nin fulfilment of their historical responsibilities, have\r\nestablished institutions and developed a process of\r\nconsultation in order to coordinate and harmonize\r\nefforts to overcome the profound causes of conflicts\r\nand to avoid retreating from the advances achieved.\r\nIt is important to reiterate in this forum that the\r\ncountries of Central America have reaffirmed our\r\ncommitments to make Central America a region of\r\npeace, liberty, democracy and development, and in\r\nparticular to foster gradually and progressively a\r\nCentral American union. This is the best route for\r\nensuring a prosperous future for the region and, at the\r\nsame time, to strengthen our capacity to confront our\r\nproblems in the best possible way, as well as to take on\r\nthe new challenges arising from globalization and\r\ninterdependence.\r\nThere is no doubt that the progress achieved at\r\nthe regional level in the coordination and unification of\r\nthe internal and external policies of the countries of the\r\nregion represents real proof of the determination of our\r\nGovernments to make sure that unity prevails over\r\ndivision. In our opinion there are more reasons that\r\nunite us than divide us, and we affirm with complete\r\nconfidence that in a globalized and interdependent\r\ncontext the viability of Central America will depend on\r\nthe joint effort to build our common historic future.\r\nThis is why we must reorient our efforts so that they\r\nmeet the requirements, aspirations and needs of our\r\nCentral American people, through specific programmes\r\nthat provide our people direct and tangible benefits.\r\nAllow me to speak about other important items on\r\nthe agenda and in the current international situation\r\nthat are of interest to the Government of El Salvador.\r\nA few days ago the Millennium Summit was\r\nconcluded, and we can say that the results obtained in\r\nthe deliberations and reflected in the final Declaration\r\nhave inspired us with hope. In particular we are\r\nheartened by the commitments made to strengthen\r\npeace, security and disarmament. Among the most\r\nnotable of these commitments are to eliminate weapons\r\nof mass destruction and to fight against transnational\r\ncrime in all its dimensions, including the global\r\nproblem of drugs and related crimes, against the illicit\r\ntrafficking in small arms, and against international\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe also are hopeful because of the commitments\r\non a highly sensitive and worrisome issue for our\r\ncountries: development and the eradication of poverty,\r\nand also on the need to develop a multilateral trade and\r\nfinancial system that is open and equitable and is based\r\non rules that are predictable and non-discriminatory.\r\nAnd we are also hopeful because of the commitments\r\nto make sure that the high-level intergovernmental\r\nmeeting on financing for development is a success.\r\nWe should mention as well the decision to reduce\r\nby half, by the year 2015, the percentage of people on\r\nthe Earth whose income is less than one dollar a day,\r\nincluding reducing hunger, and on access to drinking\r\nwater, promoting equal access to various levels of\r\neducation and promoting gender equality, reducing\r\nmaternal mortality and the propagation of diseases\r\nincluding AIDS, and protecting vulnerable individuals.\r\nWe would also highlight the commitments made\r\nto preserve the environment and to intensify efforts to\r\nreduce the number and effects of natural disasters. We\r\nwould highlight as well the commitments regarding\r\nviolations of human rights, democracy and the good\r\nmanagement of political affairs.\r\nIn our opinion the issue of the strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations deserves special attention because\r\nof the situation that the Organization currently faces\r\nwith regard to fulfilling its mandate, which has been\r\napparent during the last 10 years more than at any other\r\ntime in its history. A crisis of confidence, credibility\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nand capacity has increased the conviction of the\r\nmajority of Member States that it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to introduce substantive changes in the basic\r\nstructure of the Organization and in its decision-\r\nmaking processes in order to reflect the realities of the\r\ncurrent international order, which has greatly changed\r\nsince the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe international situation today is more\r\ncomplex, multifaceted and uncertain, blending\r\nproblems and conflicts that have become permanent\r\nfixtures on the international agenda, and there are new\r\nchallenges and threats that transcend national borders.\r\nThese include phenomena that undermine the security,\r\nsovereignty and independence of States. Taken\r\ntogether, these developments provide yet further\r\njustification for the existence of the United Nations, as\r\nwell as for the validity of its objectives and principles.\r\nWe recognize and welcome the changes\r\nintroduced in the basic functional and administrative\r\nstructure of the United Nations in order to improve its\r\nefficiency. Nevertheless, we share the general opinion\r\nregarding the imperative need to undertake integral\r\nreform. This reform should include substantial\r\ntransformations in the principal organs, not only so that\r\nthe Organization can better fulfil its mandate, but also\r\nto overcome the contradictions underlying provisions\r\nin the Charter so that the system will function in a truly\r\ndemocratic and transparent manner.\r\nFirst, we must recognize that for many years now\r\nthe mandate of the Economic and Social Council has\r\nbeen questioned. Therefore, we believe it is necessary\r\nto resume negotiations aimed at adopting measures to\r\nrevitalize one the main functions of the United Nations,\r\nwhich is the promotion of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. In particular, priority should be granted\r\nto sustainable development, with special emphasis on\r\nfighting poverty, the fight against drugs and AIDS, the\r\nprotection of the environment and respect for human\r\nrights. All of this is in conformity with the\r\ncommitments in the Millennium Declaration and\r\nespecially with the objectives pursued through\r\npreventive diplomacy. For this purpose, we believe it is\r\nappropriate to reexamine the initiative to create an\r\neconomic security council which would be responsible\r\nfor dealing with development problems.\r\nSecondly, we believe it is extremely important to\r\nexamine and evaluate the functions and powers of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, given that this is an essential organ\r\nand the most representative body in the structure of the\r\nOrganization. Nevertheless, its decisions are limited\r\nand are not binding upon the Member States. As a\r\nresult efforts must be made to strengthen and broaden\r\nthe Assemblys competence as a political forum in\r\norder to ensure the true role that it must play in world\r\naffairs. In particular the Assembly should be given\r\ngreater responsibility in the decision-making process.\r\nThis would not only strengthen the democratization\r\nand transparency of the actions of the Organization; it\r\nwould also give the Assembly the legitimacy it requires\r\nin order to carry out collective action.\r\nThirdly, the reform of the Security Council is,\r\nfrom our point of view, one of the biggest challenges\r\nfacing Member States, for my Government it is a\r\nmatter of concern that after seven years of negotiations\r\nwe have not made progress on the substantive points\r\nrelated to the category, number and privileges of new\r\nmembers, as well as on the question of the veto, which\r\nis currently an exclusive privilege of the permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nThe differences and the inflexible positions we\r\nhave seen are unacceptable because they create a\r\nsituation which, in our view, contributes to the lack of\r\ncredibility and a loss of confidence in the system of\r\ncollective security. It is urgent and we cannot postpone\r\novercoming our differences and granting each other\r\nconcessions so that we can reach a general, fair and\r\nequitable agreement in order to achieve the aims of the\r\nreform and realize the legitimate interests and hopes of\r\nmost of the countries of the international community.\r\nEl Salvador joins in the very fair demand,\r\nexpressed so many times in this forum, to increase the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members to\r\ninclude industrialized and developing countries,\r\nfaithfully reflecting the current world configuration.\r\nThe numbers should reflect the current membership of\r\nthe Organization with equal responsibilities and due\r\nrespect for geographic distribution. The use of the veto\r\nprivilege should be limited to Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter.\r\nI would like now to refer to other important\r\nissues which are part of the Assemblys agenda in the\r\nnew millennium. These issues have important\r\nrepercussions for Member States as regards\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as serious\r\nconsequences for the future of our Organization.\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nOn behalf of the people and Government of El\r\nSalvador, we welcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the\r\nOrganization. This act confirms the right of people to\r\nbe represented in this worldwide Organization and\r\nillustrates the universal nature of the United Nations.\r\nThe Charter was adopted on behalf of the people\r\nwho comprise the international community and,\r\nconsequently, the United Nations cannot, and must not,\r\nclose the door to any people which expresses its\r\nsovereign will and desire to be represented in the world\r\nOrganization.\r\nMay I refer to the special case which has been\r\ndiscussed in the Assembly each of the last eight years\r\nregarding the need to examine the exceptional\r\ninternational situation of the Republic of China in\r\nTaiwan with a view to guaranteeing full respect for the\r\nfundamental rights of its 23 million inhabitants to\r\nparticipate in the activities of the United Nations.\r\nWe support the establishment of a working group\r\nin the Assembly to examine the appropriate place that\r\nthe Republic of China should have in international\r\nbodies. We want to make it quite clear that our support\r\nfor this initiative is not intended as an intervention in\r\nthe internal affairs of another Member State. Nor does\r\nit represent opposition to the peaceful reunification of\r\nthe Chinese people. Rather, it represents the\r\nrecognition of the right of a people to realize their just\r\naspirations, a people which exercises democratic rights\r\nin a country with which we have had excellent relations\r\nfor more than 50 years.\r\nEl Salvador participated with great interest in the\r\n2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We\r\nrecognize that, even though the results were not exactly\r\nwhat we desired, encouraging agreements and\r\ndecisions were reached in the effort to achieve the\r\nobjectives of the denuclearization regime which seeks\r\nto encourage nuclear States to act in good faith, to meet\r\ntheir international responsibilities and duties and to\r\ncontinue negotiations aimed at eliminating the threat of\r\nnuclear war. With these ideas, we join the members of\r\nthe international community who have expressed their\r\nfirm support for the proposal by the Secretary-General\r\nto convene an international conference aimed at\r\nseeking ways to eliminate the nuclear threat.\r\nWith regard to conventional weapons, we wish to\r\nrefer specifically to small arms and light weapons in\r\nlight of the fact that El Salvador underwent the tragic\r\nexperience of an armed conflict during the 1980s  a\r\nconflict that was intense and of long duration precisely\r\nbecause of the entry and spread of this type of\r\nweaponry  weaponry which entered our country\r\nillegally in order to supply the irregular militias.\r\nHowever, these weapons reached other parts of the\r\npopulation and resulted in a large number of casualties\r\nand the phenomenon of displaced persons and refugees\r\nfrom the areas of conflict. This situation was solved\r\nafter the signing of the Peace Agreement in 1992.\r\nNot only do small arms and light weapons affect\r\nconflicts, be they internal or international, but traffic in\r\nthese weapons has become a danger for public security\r\nand a threat to stability, as well as a threat to the\r\ndemocracy and sovereignty of States, when these\r\nweapons are used in activities that constitute\r\ntransnational threats, such as terrorism, drug\r\ntrafficking, money laundering and international crime.\r\nFor this reason we firmly support the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held in 200l.\r\nWith regard to domestic or international conflicts\r\nthat continue to occupy the attention of the\r\ninternational community and our Organization, we can\r\nonly express our concern and regret that agreements\r\nhave not yet been reached to guarantee peace, despite\r\nmultilateral efforts. We urge all parties directly\r\ninvolved in each of the countries in conflict to abandon\r\ntheir individual or group interests so that through a\r\nnational effort, political agreements can be reached\r\nwhich will make it possible for lasting permanent\r\npeace to be established in conformity with the\r\naspirations of the peoples.\r\nMay I also refer to the Middle East. Here we\r\nbelieve that the recent negotiations at Camp David are\r\nan important step in the difficult road to peace. We\r\nhope that it will be possible to achieve stable and\r\nlasting peace within sure borders for all the peoples of\r\nthe region.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the\r\nMillennium Summit and the Millennium Assembly are\r\nhistoric events that could mark the beginning of a new\r\nera in the international order. Indeed, the Millennium\r\nDeclaration is an ambitious but vital programme to\r\ncollectively resolve our common problems. Hence, it is\r\nimperative that the commitments which we have made\r\nbecome a reality and, in the short term, we should take\r\nconcrete steps and show political will for their\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nimplementation. The peoples and Governments of the\r\ndeveloping world will be watching closely and we shall\r\ndo our utmost to implement those commitments. From\r\na realistic point of view they require the decisive\r\nsupport of the developed world in order to be fully\r\nimplemented.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nState and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and\r\nthe Francophonie of Gabon, His Excellency Mr. Jean\r\nPing.\r\nMr. Ping (Gabon) (spoke in French): I welcome\r\nthe opportunity and the honour afforded me to speak on\r\nbehalf of Gabon at this session of the Assembly which,\r\nalthough a regular one, is no less an exceptional one.\r\nIndeed, not only does this session prepare us to\r\nenter fully into the third millennium but also, and\r\nabove all, it is being held at a time in the history of\r\nhumankind that gives rise to new encouraging\r\nprospects in the minds of men throughout the world for\r\na better future.\r\nThis is why, Mr. President, we welcome your\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nWe are in fact convinced that your qualities as a\r\nstatesman and your wealth of personal experience are a\r\nguarantee for the success of our work.\r\nWith this in view, Gabon, as a Vice-President,\r\nwill give you its full cooperation so that this session\r\nmight effectively meet our expectations.\r\nI am pleased to express my deep gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, for the\r\nefficient way in which he discharged his mandate.\r\nWe, in our turn, would like to warmly welcome\r\nthe State of Tuvalu, which has just joined the great\r\nfamily of the United Nations.\r\nI should like to pay a sincere tribute to our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his steadfast\r\nefforts to realize the ideals of our Organization.\r\nIt has been 55 years since We the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations decided to maintain international\r\npeace and security, to achieve international cooperation\r\nin solving international economic and social problems\r\nand in encouraging respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms without distinction as to race,\r\nlanguage or religion.\r\nThese are the primary missions set out in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, which, in Article 55,\r\nrecommends the creation of conditions of stability and\r\nwell-being necessary for peaceful and friendly relations\r\namong  and, I would add, within  nations.\r\nThe San Francisco Charter clearly established a\r\nclose correlation between peace and development.\r\nIndeed, without peace there can be no development,\r\nand without development there can be no just and\r\nlasting peace. We acknowledge that it is difficult to\r\ncreate conditions of increased prosperity for the\r\ngreatest number in an environment where chaos and\r\ndisorder reign. In this regard, the case of Africa is\r\nparticularly revealing. When, after the end of the cold\r\nwar, the world seemed to be developing towards a\r\npromising situation because of the gradual reduction of\r\ninter-State conflicts, the African continent suddenly\r\nfell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented\r\nviolence. Dormant antagonisms have been reawakened,\r\nwith the primary manifestation being the clash of arms\r\nand disdain for fundamental humanitarian norms.\r\nSeveral of our countries have come under the\r\nyoke of warlords and become chaotic, ungovernable\r\nentities that now require humanitarian assistance.\r\nDespite the 50 or so peacekeeping operations that it has\r\nundertaken since the creation of the United Nations,\r\nthe Security Council has shown its limitations in the\r\nface of crises, especially in Africa. The Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone and\r\nSomalia are all cases that, in recent memory, have put\r\nthe solidarity of the United Nations to the test.\r\nIn the area of development, the world has seen\r\nunprecedented economic progress in the past 55 years.\r\nCountries that were underdeveloped not very long ago\r\nhave become dynamic centres of world economic\r\nactivity. But there is another fact: the vast majority of\r\nour countries and peoples remain desperately poor.\r\nIn his message to commemorate the World Day of\r\nPeace, His Holiness Pope John Paul II wrote,\r\nAt the beginning of a new century, the one\r\nissue which most challenges our human and\r\nChristian consciences is the poverty of countless\r\nmillions of men and women.\r\nAccording to the report (A/55/1) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization dated\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\n30 August 2000, almost half of the worlds population\r\nmust content itself with living on less than $2 per\r\nperson per day. So it is that 300 million Africans do not\r\nhave even $1 a day on which to subsist. Furthermore,\r\nthis poverty is being made worse, in particular by the\r\nrapid spread of AIDS, another scourge that has\r\nravaged, brought suffering to, divided and decimated\r\nentire families in Africa and throughout the world. In\r\nsome African countries, AIDS has even become the\r\nmain cause of death.\r\nThese are factors for destabilization. While they\r\nare all different, together they create disorder and make\r\ninternational relations uncertain. But I do not intend\r\nmerely to provide a list of all the evils with which the\r\nAssembly is only too well acquainted and the United\r\nNations is constantly dealing. Nor should we neglect\r\nthe efforts undertaken and the progress achieved.\r\nRather, I should like to stress  here I am in\r\nagreement with the Assembly  that the United\r\nNations and the multilateral system do not have\r\nsufficient resources to face these major challenges. We\r\nhave been working at this for a long time now. We\r\ncannot now give in to discouragement. We are duty-\r\nbound to give the necessary impetus to our action.\r\nHow are we to do this? First, by moving from a\r\nculture of war to a genuine culture of peace. Gabons\r\ndedication to the ideal of peace, which is a constant\r\nelement of its foreign policy, draws its strength from\r\nthe same roots as the Bantu civilization. We have a\r\nduty to give pride of place to the virtues of dialogue\r\nand tolerance among peoples and nations  virtues\r\nthat we practise in our homes and families, and that my\r\ncountry, through the personal intercession of President\r\nOmar Bongo, a tireless mediator, has made into a\r\nprinciple of political and diplomatic culture.\r\nWe must therefore return to our roots. That is, we\r\nshould go back to those traditional precepts that have\r\ngreater force today than ever before, given that today,\r\npeace is most often threatened not from outside our\r\nterritories but from within. We must adapt the United\r\nNations Charter to these new situations, in particular\r\nby adjusting the mandate of the Security Council with\r\nregard to internal crises.\r\nIt is in this context that we welcome the issuance\r\nof the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations, presided over by Mr. Brahimi. We are\r\nconvinced that this report will help to promote a new\r\napproach to peacekeeping operations. Although\r\npeacekeeping operations are necessary as a means of\r\nresponding, they are nevertheless insufficient. What is\r\nat stake in the third millennium is not simply the\r\nachievement of ceasefires among adversaries in open\r\nconflicts, but the ability to nip conflicts in the bud\r\nthrough action designed to eliminate the deep-rooted\r\ncauses of violence.\r\nAn important step would be the creation or\r\nstrengthening of regional security machinery to allow\r\nus to resolve conflicts through dialogue and\r\nnegotiation, thus enabling us to considerably reduce\r\nmilitary expenditure and allocate the resources thereby\r\nreleased to other development needs.\r\nAt the subregional level, therefore, Gabon is\r\ncontributing, in cooperation with the other States of\r\nCentral Africa, to the establishment of a climate of\r\nconfidence after implementing preventive diplomacy.\r\nThe heads of State of our subregion have, for\r\nexample, set up the Council for Peace and Security in\r\nCentral Africa (COPAX), a body for military and\r\npolitical cooperation between the member States of the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States, to\r\npromote measures to maintain and consolidate peace\r\nand security. COPAX has a multinational force for\r\nCentral Africa and an early-warning mechanism for\r\nCentral Africa.\r\nThe Gabonese Government has taken practical\r\nand financial steps for the effective start of MARACs\r\nactivities, for which it is the headquarters. However, it\r\ngoes without saying that it is with the support of the\r\nUnited Nations and other partners that this instrument\r\nwill play its role fully.\r\nIn a broader regional context, a similar\r\nframework for joint action, cooperation, development,\r\nprevention, management and conflict resolution, the\r\nGulf of Guinea commission, made up of neighbouring\r\nNigeria and seven coastal central African States, was\r\ncreated on 19 November 1999 in Libreville.\r\nFinally, it is important to strength the multilateral\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation machinery. Gabon,\r\nwhich ratified the Convention banning anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, the Convention banning chemical weapons\r\nand the Treaty banning nuclear testing, will continue to\r\nactively support international disarmament efforts by\r\nencouraging the process that has been set in motion of\r\ncombating the illicit trade in light arms and small\r\nweapons. The convening, in the summer of 2001, of an\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\ninternational conference on that trade is important,\r\nsince it is quite clear that most conflicts in Africa and\r\nelsewhere in the world are fed by traffickers in arms,\r\ndrugs and diamonds, and are supported by, among\r\nother things, a number of major multinational\r\ncorporations that benefit from ill-gotten gains,\r\nproviding arms and drugs to the conflict zones and\r\nparticipating in money-laundering operations.\r\nWe also unreservedly support the creation of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, and strongly advocate the\r\nrapid entry into force of the Rome Statute.\r\nWith regard to strengthening the fight against\r\npoverty and the initiation of new cooperation in the\r\nservice of development, the African continent accepts\r\nthat it bears the primary responsibility for its economic\r\nrecovery and that success in this task depends mainly\r\non its own efforts. But, at a time when the world is\r\nhappily entering the twenty-first century, Africa,\r\nmarginalized, is prey to destitution and poverty. The\r\nscope of the crisis it is experiencing and the importance\r\nof the resources to be made available require that the\r\ninternational community support its efforts through\r\nincreased concessional resources, expansion of\r\ncommerce and trade and debt relief.\r\nCooperation on this painful issue of poverty was\r\ndiscussed last January in Libreville by the heads of\r\nState and Government of sub-Saharan Africa and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, at a conference where a\r\nnew approach to poverty eradication was proposed,\r\nwith a target date of 2015. During that economic\r\nsummit the heads of State and Government made\r\nrecommendations on considering the continents\r\nprospects at the dawn of the new millennium and on\r\nthe challenges to be faced in speeding up economic\r\ngrowth and eradicating poverty.\r\nThere is no doubt that poverty eradication\r\nrequires much quicker economic growth, with its fruits\r\nbenefiting the greatest number. In this regard, social\r\njustice is a useful guide if we wish development and\r\neconomic growth to produce beneficial results that are\r\nmore equitably shared.\r\nOur heads of State and Government committed\r\nthemselves to redoubling their efforts to promote solid\r\nand sustainable growth in order to reduce poverty.\r\nFurthermore, they reiterated their determination to\r\nspeed up the process of subregional and regional\r\nintegration already begun with the creation of the\r\nAfrican Union this year in Lomé.\r\nAn open and interdependent world needs\r\nmechanisms to retain its balance and to help promote\r\njustice by preventing aggression against individuals\r\nand nature. It also needs participation in development\r\nfor all countries and peoples and efficiency in\r\neconomic relations by encouraging transparency,\r\npredictability and stability in international relations.\r\nOne solution would be  and on this point I\r\nagree with the view of many experts  for\r\ninternational development cooperation to cover not\r\nonly assistance, but also all activities necessary to\r\nguarantee sustainable development throughout the\r\nworld based on the individual.\r\nWe could then agree that development assistance\r\nfirst contributes to creating national conditions for\r\ndevelopment and to combating poverty, which is\r\nobviously incompatible with justice, popular\r\nparticipation and effectiveness.\r\nAs necessary as the achievement of food self-\r\nsufficiency throughout the world may appear, the\r\nnational capacity of the developing world should be\r\nstrengthened in order to facilitate the effective\r\nimplementation of international agreements on\r\nenvironmental protection, trade liberalization,\r\nmacroeconomic management and banking supervision,\r\nwhich are so essential to the proper functioning of a\r\nglobalized economy.\r\nLooking back at history, one can see that after the\r\nSecond World War development cooperation was\r\nsynonymous with solidarity and aid: assistance from\r\nthe richest countries to the poorest. It is time for this\r\ncooperation to be transformed, made more dynamic\r\nand, above all, become part of the new fact of\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe recent ministerial meeting initiated by Mr.\r\nMark Malloch Brown, the Administrator of the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), highlighted\r\nthe need to strengthen the institutions capacity in order\r\nto fulfil its mission more effectively. This\r\nstrengthening is particularly necessary, since today,\r\nmore than ever before, it is not possible to conceive of\r\ndevelopment without taking environmental\r\nrequirements duly into account. UNDP could, for\r\ninstance, intensify its assistance to countries that draw\r\npart of their resources from forest products to achieve\r\nsustainable and ecologically viable management of the\r\nforests.\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nWith regard to strengthening protection of the\r\nenvironment, the debate under way in the United\r\nNations, which consists of blaming only the forest\r\ncountries, is unjust, since we know that the greenhouse\r\ngas emissions produced by the industrialized countries\r\nare largely responsible for the harm done to our planet.\r\nPassing responsibility back and forth would not be\r\nconstructive. To the contrary, we should rather search\r\ntogether, in the spirit of the 1992 Rio Conference, for\r\nways and means to enable us all to preserve the balance\r\nof our natural ecosystem.\r\nI turn to the alleviation of the crushing external\r\ndebt burden. On this crucial point, my country devotes\r\nnearly half its annual budget to repaying debt, thereby\r\ncompromising its efforts and chances for development.\r\nThe debt relief mechanisms advocated in recent years\r\nhave been discriminatory with regard to our country by\r\nexcluding us from their application. We say that the\r\nreasoning is unfair, being based on our high per capita\r\ngross domestic product, without taking into account\r\neither our ability to pay or the seriously\r\ndisproportionate distribution of national income\r\nbetween capital, labour and taxation.\r\nA study carried out recently by a team of\r\nuniversity specialists in Gabon shows that less than 40\r\nper cent of our gross domestic product is likely to\r\ncause a multiplier effect locally.\r\nThe peculiar situation of Gabon, the only country\r\nin the so-called intermediate-income category in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, is due to the fact that its wealth is\r\nproduced by, and for, external protagonists.\r\nThus the appeal made to the international\r\ncommunity for a fairer treatment of my countrys debt\r\nand that of others is not simply a form of begging.\r\nWhat is at stake is the strengthening of the\r\ninternational trading system for the benefit of all, so\r\nthat globalization, as the Secretary-General has quite\r\nrightly said, might become a positive force for all of\r\nhumankind. The debt problem remains a major source\r\nof concern for African countries, not just my own. We\r\nbelieve that our partners should show some\r\nimagination rather than coming up with the same tired\r\nsolutions.\r\nThat is why, in considering the debt problem,\r\naccount should be taken not only of socio-economic\r\nindicators but also of the efforts made by a State to\r\ncombat poverty and the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment. We will say it again: helping the South\r\nhelps the North and helps everyone.\r\nThe status of the developing countries,\r\nparticularly those of Africa, requires broad-based\r\naction on the part of the international community in\r\norder to translate into reality our duties of solidarity\r\ntowards peoples.\r\nOfficial development assistance continues to\r\ndecline. Following up on the recommendations of the\r\nCopenhagen World Summit for Social Development,\r\nrecently reaffirmed in Geneva, my country, in its fight\r\nagainst poverty, is now implementing the 20/20\r\ninitiative  that is, 20 per cent of its national budget\r\nand 20 per cent of official development assistance are\r\nallocated to basic social services. We all know here that\r\nthe 20/20 initiative is an excellent way to combat\r\npoverty.\r\nRegrettably, Gabons efforts have been hampered\r\nby the dizzying decline in official development\r\nassistance and its exclusion from the benefits of\r\nexternal concessional financing.\r\nI turn now to the protection of vulnerable peoples\r\nand the fight against HIV/AIDS.\r\nAnother aspect of political and social problems in\r\nAfrica and throughout the world is the status of women\r\nand children in society. In my country, women have the\r\nsame rights as men. Our educational system ensures\r\nfree schooling for all school-age children, in the\r\ninterests of the Gabonese nation as a whole. School\r\nenrolment has risen from 27 per cent in 1950 to more\r\nthan 90 per cent today.\r\nFurthermore, my country is resolutely committed\r\nto promoting and protecting the rights of the child.\r\nAccordingly, we hosted in February 2000 in Libreville\r\nan international conference on trafficking in children\r\nand on child labour.\r\nWe call for the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of that conference, which are a direct\r\nfollow-up to the United Nations Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child and its two additional Protocols,\r\nsigned here by the head of State of Gabon.\r\nRegarding the campaign against HIV/AIDS, I am\r\npleased to inform the Assembly that, at the initiative of\r\nPresident Bongo, the Gabonese Government has just\r\ncreated a national solidarity fund to combat this\r\npandemic. Gabon believes that the creation of an\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\ninternational solidarity fund to combat AIDS would no\r\ndoubt help the 35 million people stricken with this\r\nillness, the majority of whom are in developing\r\ncountries, especially in Africa.\r\nI turn now to the reform and restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations system. In his report entitled We the\r\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, the Secretary-General emphasized the\r\nneed to renew the United Nations. This renewal\r\nrequires that we identify the major assets of the United\r\nNations, rebuild its infrastructure and information-\r\ntechnology capacities, and continue the peaceful\r\nrevolution  that is, the reforms begun in 1997.\r\nIn this context, it is necessary to revise the scale\r\nof assessments. It is in the interest of us all that we\r\nreadjust the scale of assessments, so that the burden of\r\nthe Organizations expenditures, and thereby its\r\nfreedom of action, does not rest on the shoulders of\r\nonly a few Member States.\r\nThe current millennium, a symbol of divine\r\ngenerosity and perfection to which we are bearing\r\nwitness, has the potential to give rise to further\r\nprogress in the building of a more just and peaceful\r\nworld. Every nation represented here is a reflection of\r\nhumankind, whose common values were recalled by\r\nthe founders of the United Nations. Humanity is itself\r\nin the image of God, and we must therefore together\r\nbring to fruition the precious gifts bestowed by our\r\nCreator: love, peace and freedom.\r\nThe United Nations must retain what has shown\r\nitself to be tried and true, adapt where necessary and\r\ndevise new forms of regulation.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs and Communities of Cape Verde, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Rui Alberto de Figueiredo Soares.\r\nMr. Soares (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Let me\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over\r\nthis fifth-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am\r\nconfident that your well-known experience in the fields\r\nof politics and diplomacy will ensure the success of our\r\nwork.\r\nTo your predecessor, Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nI would like to convey my delegations appreciation of\r\nhis dynamic and successful leadership of the fifty-\r\nfourth session.\r\nI would like also to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the remarkable\r\ncontribution made by his report, We the peoples,\r\nwhich provides a solid foundation for our discussions\r\nand for our common efforts to place this Organization\r\nincreasingly in the service of our community of\r\nnations.\r\nIt is with satisfaction that I extend my warmest\r\ncongratulations to Tuvalu, a member of the community\r\nof small island developing States, on its admission to\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nDuring the current session of the General\r\nAssembly, important meetings will take place that will\r\naddress issues vital to the international community.\r\nThese issues include financing for development; racism\r\nand racial discrimination, xenophobia and related\r\nintolerance; and the development of the least developed\r\ncountries. These global meetings will certainly\r\nsignificantly enrich the set of consensus documents\r\nwhich we have successfully produced, particularly\r\nduring the 1990s, and which are intended to provide us\r\nwith essential frameworks for the optimization of an\r\nupdated international cooperation.\r\nAs is well known, this resource has not been\r\nexploited to any great extent. North-South dialogue\r\ncontinues to be affected by reciprocal accusations\r\nbetween worlds separated by gross disparities in the\r\nlevel of well-being.\r\nThe world needs to be governed well and in a\r\nspirit of cooperation if we really wish to achieve\r\ndevelopment, justice and peace in a climate of social\r\nstability.\r\nAnd yet, on both the national and international\r\nlevels, the privileged continue to deny others open\r\nparticipation and a fair share. Thus, the question of\r\ngovernance arises at all levels. But at each level, those\r\nin whose interest it is to maintain the status quo use the\r\nother levels deficiencies to justify their own inaction.\r\nIt is a perverse logic to think that our partners errors\r\nauthorize us to err as well. This is a pattern of\r\nbehaviour, and even an assertion, which has been\r\nportrayed as reflecting a reality of life; how this is to\r\nbe overcome has yet to be clarified.\r\nIt will be some time before we see even the\r\nimmediate results of that great dialogue between world\r\nleaders, the Millennium Summit. However, we are\r\nconfident that results will not fail to emerge. At the\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nhighest level, the meetings between international\r\nleaders served as a platform for the growing, insistent\r\naffirmation that we have the know-how and the means\r\nto solve the problems of our societies and of the\r\ncommon ground on which we live. What we lack is the\r\nappropriate implementation of decisions and the\r\nnecessary will to do so. By this, I mean the political\r\nwill to accomplish collectively what is necessary and\r\nsufficient so that we may achieve progress for all\r\nhumankind, a long-time goal of our ideology and our\r\ndiscourse.\r\nAwareness of the need for this political will stem\r\nfrom the underlying belief that we make up, and are\r\npart of, an interdependent international community\r\nwhose essence links the destinies of all to the success\r\nor failure of a single endeavour.\r\nMeanwhile, in the blend of competition and\r\ncooperation that characterizes international relations,\r\nthe scale is still weighted in favour of a framework of\r\ninequalities, asymmetries and egotism that increasingly\r\nimpairs our capacities and our imagination in the effort\r\nto achieve general progress and well-being.\r\nThus, a vital question is that of the extent to\r\nwhich we will see, at the international level, and\r\nparticularly in the case of those who benefit most from\r\nthe current situation, a growing belief in the existence\r\nof true independence and in the urgency of the need for\r\ncoordination and cooperation commensurate with such\r\nglobal interdependence.\r\nAt the same time, we need to view globalization\r\nnot as it is today  exclusive, fragmented and offering\r\nopportunities only to a select few  but rather as a\r\nprocess that will increasingly reveal and establish the\r\nworld as a single body.\r\nThe Millennium Summit once again posed the\r\nquestion of the role of the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century. I believe that our universal\r\nOrganization has an essential role to play as a catalyst\r\nfor the tangible realization of the concept of\r\ninternational community inscribed within its Charter\r\nand as a basis for its political vision. In the world of\r\ntoday and tomorrow, where events are the result of\r\naction by a variety of decision makers, the promotion\r\nof such an endeavour by the United Nations\r\npresupposes the involvement of all parties\r\nconcerned  that is, Governments, of course, but also\r\nparliaments, the general public, organizations of civil\r\nsociety, the private sector, the media, and so forth. All\r\nof them can and should be included in this undertaking,\r\nthe purpose of which is to reveal the convergence\r\ntranscending the apparent contradictions.\r\nAs a free, universal association of States, the\r\nUnited Nations has as its mission, and should make\r\nitself able, to gather the worlds voices and to give\r\nthem room for dialogue in pursuit of higher platforms\r\nof understanding. In that regard, the fundamental\r\nvalues embodied in the Millennium Declaration\r\nprovide a lasting source of inspiration.\r\nIn the short term, however, we need a consistent\r\nset of measures in order to create an enabling\r\nenvironment for development in which poverty\r\neradication can be sustainably achieved. The priorities\r\nto be considered in developing such measures will vary\r\nto some extent. In the areas of greatest poverty, such as\r\nthe African continent, it is certainly essential to reverse\r\nthe decline in public health and to devote the necessary\r\nresources to improving the quality and expanding the\r\nscope of public education. In todays world, there can\r\nbe no development unless the people have reached a\r\nminimum level of health and education, and unless the\r\ncountry in question has reached a reasonable level of\r\ninfrastructure, without which it cannot viably accept\r\nthe economic investment that it needs.\r\nFurthermore, countless developing countries\r\ncontinue to hope for lasting solutions to the core\r\nproblem of an unsustainable debt burden, solutions to\r\nreplace the long string of half-measures, always too\r\nlittle and too late, with which this issue has been\r\naddressed in the past.\r\nEven with adequate economic policies, a\r\nresponsible administration and a productive society,\r\nStates capacity to make real, continued progress will\r\nbe significantly limited if they face restricted access to\r\ninternational markets and if tariff and non-tariff\r\nbarriers are imposed on them. Particularly in the case\r\nof the least developed countries, these constraints may\r\nmake it impossible for them to integrate into the global\r\neconomy.\r\nBefore closing, I wish to express my deepest\r\nconcern at the form and intensity of the conflicts that\r\ncontinue to affect the daily lives of various countries\r\nand their peoples, with disastrous consequences at the\r\ninternal and regional levels. In that regard, it is with\r\nthe greatest apprehension that we view the current\r\nsituation in Sierra Leone, a country of our subregion;\r\nand we hope that the recently developed measures\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\ninvolving the coordination of efforts by the United\r\nNations and the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) will help restore to the people of\r\nSierra Leone the peace and stability to which they are\r\nentitled.\r\nCape Verde continues to follow closely the\r\nsituation in Angola, a country with which we share a\r\nlong history. Owing to the refusal of UNITA to respect\r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions and to comply\r\nwith the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, the\r\nhumanitarian drama that affects the Angolan people\r\nand, in particular, the massive numbers of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, has reached intolerable levels. The\r\ninternational community should therefore give the\r\nhighest priority to providing humanitarian assistance to\r\nAngola.\r\nIn East Timor, the laudable efforts of the United\r\nNations augur well for the exercise of direct\r\nsovereignty and self-determination in the near future.\r\nHowever, there are signs of continued efforts to disrupt\r\nthis process. The recent murder of international civil\r\nservants serving as peacekeepers merits the deepest\r\ncondemnation of the international community and\r\nadequate measures by the Security Council.\r\nThe role of the United Nations, increasingly\r\nfocused on the value and dignity of human beings,\r\nrequires each of us  large and small, rich and poor \r\nto wager confidently on the solidarity of our common\r\nefforts as the touchstone in our collective search for\r\nsolutions to the problems affecting our planet.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi, Minister of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Ndombasi (Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo) (spoke in French): Once again I shall rely on\r\nthe kindness of those who interpret our speeches, since\r\nI am yet again putting them to the test of working\r\nwithout a written text.\r\nI shall switch between repetition and familiar\r\nissues, between deception and truth.\r\nFirst, repetition. As last year, the President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Mr. Laurent-Désiré\r\nKabila, has sent me to this very same rostrum to speak\r\nabout the same issues. Once again our invaders and\r\naggressors  from Rwanda and Uganda in\r\nparticular  are in our country, and I shall speak about\r\nthis again. This falls under the heading of repetition.\r\nI shall talk about this issue in the spirit and the letter of\r\nthe principles of the United Nations. The letter is\r\nimportant insofar as it helps us make sense of this\r\nsituation. I would suggest to delegations a small\r\nexercise regarding the reputedly historic work we do\r\nhere. By playing with historic a little, by transposing\r\na letter or two, another meaning can be found.\r\nI am awaiting the letter of the solution that the\r\nUnited Nations will adopt one day regarding the\r\nproblem of the aggression against, and occupation of\r\nour country by, people who are here in this very Hall\r\nand who have spoken falsely yesterday and today.\r\nUganda has said that it has come to my country in\r\norder to solve problems among the Congolese. Have\r\nthe Ugandans come as tourists? Have they come as\r\nscientific researchers?\r\nWe need to return to the letter of the definition of\r\naggression. These people, who ordinarily are our\r\nneighbours, leave their country, cross our borders,\r\ncome into our country and are occupying it even as I\r\nspeak. And, as if they had not already gone too far,\r\nthey have taken it upon themselves to say what we\r\nshould do to settle the problems among the Congolese\r\npeople. They do not talk about inter-Ugandan dialogue;\r\nthey do not talk about inter-Rwandan dialogue. They\r\ntalk about the inter-Congolese dialogue. Perhaps that is\r\nwhy they are slitting peoples throats, massacring\r\npeople, cutting off penises, burying women alive. They\r\nare planting fields of arms in the way that Van Gogh\r\nplanted fields of sunflowers, burying women alive and\r\nleaving their arms sticking out of their graves  with\r\nthe idea of later harvesting arms. They have multiplied\r\nthe number of Dachaus by thousands. They shut up our\r\npopulations in their humble huts and then set the huts\r\non fire. Perhaps this is their understanding of\r\nparticipating in a solution to the Congolese problem.\r\nUnjustifiably!\r\nIt is a deception for the head of State of one of\r\nthese countries to play around in New York and say\r\nWe will not leave the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. Notwithstanding the clear resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council  resolutions 1234 (1999) and 1304\r\n(2000)  which state plainly that the Rwandans, the\r\nUgandans and Burundians must leave the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, representatives of those\r\ncountries come here and say We will not leave.\r\nThese impostors come to this very building and dare to\r\nengage in such arm wrestling for the benefit of the\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nleaders and other representatives of the countries\r\ngathered here.\r\nI do not want someone to tell me  even if it is\r\ntrue \r\n(spoke in English)\r\nYou have made a wonderful speech.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI want to be told We shall report back to our\r\nGovernments and heads of State what you said,\r\nbecause it is the truth: truth in response to deception.\r\nAs the philosopher Spinoza said, Verum index sui et\r\nfalsi; that is, truth is a touchstone both of the truth\r\nitself and of falsehood. One of our singers  his name,\r\nKoffi Olomide, is worth remembering  sings, in one\r\nof the languages that are well known to Africans who\r\nlisten to Congolese music and from which I am\r\ntranslating: A lie takes the elevator, but the truth uses\r\nthe stairs. The phrase is even prettier in Lingala.\r\nAnd so it is  the lies of the aggressors have\r\nquickly arisen to fool people. They are trying to pass\r\nfor little lambs, these people who are in a country that\r\nis not their own, where no one wants them to be and\r\nwhere they have not been invited. They are there. And\r\nthey have the nerve to say We will not leave,\r\nnotwithstanding the clear Security Council resolutions\r\nthat enjoin them to leave our country without delay or\r\nconditions.\r\nI am repeating today what I said last year;\r\nhowever, I must repeat this because these people are\r\nstill in my country and show no sign of leaving. They\r\nhave outrageous plans, such as creating a Great Lakes\r\nRepublic by cutting up our country and joining entire\r\nprovinces of it to their countries.\r\nAll of this will seem quite clear if you look at a\r\nmap of my country. You will see that our 2.347 million\r\nsquare kilometres are located amid small asteroids that\r\ngravitate around it in some sort of Brownian motion.\r\nThey enter our country, massacre people and, as I said\r\nearlier, shamelessly state that they are not going to\r\nleave. They believe that this lie will prevail because it\r\nhas taken the lift, while our truth has to take the stairs.\r\nBut I believe that our truth is making headway in your\r\nminds. Right is on our side.\r\nNone of our own soldiers are in Kigali or in\r\nKampala, but there is an unwanted multitude of foreign\r\nsoldiers in my country, growing in number as well as in\r\nweaponry. No doubt they are there for tourism. Since\r\nwe are embarking upon a historic millennium  and\r\nwe should consider the meaning of that adjective  we\r\nmust remind those people that they have to leave now,\r\ntoday. They should go home. They must not remain in\r\nmy country because what they are doing is abominable.\r\nI have given the Assembly a Dantesque\r\ndescription of what these people are doing in my\r\ncountry, supposedly for peaceful reasons. They are\r\nmassacring people, as I have stated. They are burying\r\nwomen alive and cutting off the penises of prisoners.\r\nThis needs to be analysed. Why would anyone do that\r\nto prisoners? The lies in the lift will not tell you about\r\nthat, but the stairway will. I hope you will inform your\r\nrespective Governments of the realities of the situation\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. People say it\r\nis complex, but in fact it is not complex at all. Those\r\npeople are not in their country. They have crossed our\r\nborders, supposedly to secure their own borders and\r\nsupposedly because the génocidaires are in my country,\r\noccasionally returning to their own countries to sow\r\ndisorder.\r\nOnce again, look at a map of our country. You\r\nwill see that the asteroids that I mentioned, Rwanda in\r\nparticular, have borders on Lake Kivu. It is a very\r\nsmall area that is the real border between us. If you\r\nlook at the map, you will see that these asteroids, in\r\norder to secure their borders, have gone 2,000\r\nkilometres beyond this real border, to the Atlantic, to\r\nstart a war. We do not know how they manage to move\r\ntheir soldiers around because they do not have\r\naeroplanes; however, know that they manage. They\r\nmove heavy weaponry 2,000 kilometres in order to\r\nstart a war, the purpose of which is to defend their\r\nborders 2,000 kilometres away. Who can possibly\r\nbelieve this? Who can claim that this is the truth?\r\nWhen you wish to defend and secure your border, you\r\nput your troops at your border so that others do not\r\ncross.\r\nThere is yet another lie: they say that they are\r\npursuing the perpetrators of the genocide that everyone\r\nremembers from 1994. They claim that they are\r\npursuing them because they have hidden in our\r\ncountry. Well, these people occupy two provinces in\r\nthe border area of our country and one other province\r\nthat is even farther away, farther from the equator.\r\nThey have never caught any génocidaires, living\r\nor dead. It would be a shock if they did. The Rwandans\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nare saying that there are génocidaires in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in order to justify\r\ntheir presence. However, they have never caught any.\r\nWhy have they never caught a génocidaire? I\r\nthink they are incapable of doing two things at once.\r\nEach Rwandan or Ugandan has only two hands, and\r\nthose two hands are busy. Do you know what they are\r\ndoing? They are taking our diamonds, copper, gold,\r\nprecious wood and rare animals, which they do not\r\nhave on their asteroids. And they are becoming\r\ndiamond exporters. If you look at the stock exchange,\r\nyou will see that Rwanda this month exported so many\r\ndiamonds, but those diamonds are covered in the blood\r\nof the Congolese people. The gemocracy that\r\nemploys them is doing the same thing in Sierra Leone,\r\nLiberia and Angola. One could say that the common\r\ndenominator between those countries and ours is that\r\nwe are under the thumb of gemocrats who prevent us\r\nfrom creating democracy. We have gemocrats against\r\ndemocrats. That is the deepest meaning to be found in\r\nthese poor countries that wish to become rich through\r\npillaging and plundering, which they do in the full light\r\nof day where everyone can see them. What is more\r\nsurprising still is that nobody tells them to stop their\r\nplundering and go home. This is an absolute fraud, and\r\nit threatens our African brothers as well. A country that\r\nis one eightieth the size of ours, that not long ago,\r\nbefore Lumumba, held the reins of our country, dares\r\nto allow its justice system  because in our country\r\nthere are patriots and nationalists \r\nI come from a province near the Atlantic, 2,000\r\nkilometres away from the Rwandan border. I see\r\nappear in my province people who are easily\r\nrecognized by their phenotype, accompanied by some\r\nCongolese passing through the province on their way to\r\nKinshasa. They even go to the airport to defend their\r\nborders, which are 2,000 kilometres away. Our patriots\r\nand nationalists stand up and do not welcome them. We\r\ntell them what we must tell them, as a true patriot\r\nwould do in the face of the invader.\r\nThat country, one eightieth the size of our own,\r\nallows its justice system to prosecute me, to issue an\r\narrest warrant against me and to inform all other\r\ncountries that if I go to their country, I should be\r\narrested for crimes against humanity, just because I\r\nspoke as a patriot against those who have come into my\r\ncountry.\r\nOne country, more powerful than the others, has\r\nasked, because of the thrashing it has received, to be\r\nallowed a corridor to the Atlantic. We do not know how\r\nthese people got to the province of Kivu, which they\r\nhave virtually annexed. They have changed the local\r\nadministrators, appointed new governors and changed\r\nthe telephone system. In order to call this province, you\r\nhave to dial the code for Rwanda. This is well known.\r\nThey even direct automobile traffic. In other words,\r\nthey have completely taken over our province.\r\nNonetheless, in their speeches they say they are in\r\nfavour of the territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. At the same time, though, they are appointing\r\ngovernors in our country, changing the names of our\r\nstreets and making decisions as if it were their country.\r\nThese countries have spilled blood in our jungle\r\nand dare to assume the right to tell us who our Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs should be. In threatening my\r\nfreedom of movement, perhaps they imagined that I\r\nwould not manage to reach New York, but we have\r\nmore than one trick up our sleeve. Here I am. I will\r\nleave New York and go wherever my President tells me\r\nto go. We hope that other countries that wish to\r\nmaintain good relations with us will refuse to heed\r\nthese uneducated judges.\r\nI say uneducated because I have urged our\r\npeople to rise and crush the invaders and to make them\r\neat their words, but these judges thought I had called\r\nfor the invaders to be strangled. These judges are so\r\nuneducated they did not realize that I was quoting\r\nVoltaire. And now that Ive admitted to quoting\r\nVoltaire, they will probably issue international arrest\r\nwarrants for him, because they have no idea who he\r\nwas. Who are these countries to appoint themselves\r\nuniversal judges and to prosecute people who are not\r\ntheir citizens for acts that were not committed in their\r\nterritories? These judges do not rely on law  since\r\ntheir position is indefensible  but on the law of the\r\njungle, because they are hunters. They made their\r\npronouncements two years ago. They are like hunters\r\nwho make no sound as they stalk their prey, but I too\r\nam silent. I have not been warned or notified, but\r\nINTERPOL knows it must arrest me if it gets its hands\r\non me. They have been just like big game hunters.\r\nEveryone knows what happened to our Prime\r\nMinister, Mr. Lumumba. In the tragedy in which a\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations lost his life,\r\nthe people  one person in particular  who carried\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nout that dirty work dissolved Lumumbas body in\r\nsulphuric acid. Perhaps they are after me now because\r\nthey are suffering a shortage of sulphuric acid. This\r\ngentlemen kept one of Lumumbas teeth as a talisman\r\nand displayed it on television, admitting that they had\r\ndismembered Lumumbas body, dissolved it in\r\nsulphuric acid and kept his tooth as a charm. These\r\nuniversal judges have not been moved to prosecute the\r\nperson who boasts of having dissolved Lumumbas\r\nbody and kept one of his teeth. I think these people\r\nintend to open a museum some time soon and to grow\r\nrich charging admission to see Lumumbas tooth.\r\nMy African brothers may also be prosecuted\r\nwhen people arrogating the right to appoint members of\r\nGovernment issue warrants for them. That is why my\r\nbrothers should not remain silent. They are foreign\r\nministers and the same thing could happen to them.\r\nThey should react. They should not think of me as\r\nsomeone who is uneducated. These countries must be\r\nprevented from acting beyond their rights. No one\r\nassigned them the task of running the worlds affairs\r\nthrough their own brand of justice.\r\nI do not wish to linger on this ridiculous topic,\r\nbut I would go even further in discussing truth and\r\nmendacity. Everyone is convinced that we are erecting\r\nobstacles to the diplomatic work of the United Nations,\r\nbut Lumumbas tooth should be a sign that we have\r\nhistorical reasons for our actions. What goes around\r\ncomes around. I recognize that we have been very\r\nparticular about how the United Nations forces may be\r\ndeployed, but we have acceded to the Organizations\r\nwishes. We agreed to the Mission and to the Lusaka\r\nCeasefire Agreement, although the fire has yet to\r\ncease. People persist in believing in the validity of the\r\nAgreement, but it was signed on 10 July 1999 and the\r\nfires are still burning today and the war continues.\r\nStill, people keep talking about the Lusaka Ceasefire\r\nAgreement.\r\nWell, the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement designates\r\nthe invaders, the aggressors, as parties. These parties\r\nsigned the Agreement, but Security Council resolution\r\n1304 (2000) implies that they are the aggressors and\r\nenjoins them to leave my country. Thus, they are no\r\nlonger parties, but aggressors who should leave as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nMoreover, their Congolese puppets are playing\r\nthe role of Trojan horse. These invaders have exploited\r\ncertain Congolese supporters of Mobutu to justify their\r\ninvasion of our country and their aggression. Now, one\r\nof these asteroids is giving shelter to Mobutus former\r\nsoldiers. They are training in Kampala and their aim of\r\nreturning to Kinshasa has been openly declared. One\r\nlarge country is helping others to build military bases\r\non our borders and is training their soldiers in order to\r\nincrease tourism in our country.\r\nWe must be vigilant. We must act to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations resolutions. We\r\nwould tell the United Nations that, in order to be more\r\neffective and to have a greater chance of success, it\r\nmust implement its own resolutions. I would express\r\nthe hope that I shall not have to return here next year to\r\nrepeat yet again that the Rwandans are still in my\r\ncountry, sowing death and pillaging our land. The\r\nUnited Nations must finally implement its own\r\nresolutions.\r\nHow can it do so? It can compel the Ugandans\r\nand Rwandans to return to their homes. We do not want\r\nthem in our country. They are our eternal neighbours,\r\nasteroids that orbit our planet. Let them go home. Let\r\nthem talk to us. We want this war to end as all others\r\ndo: with negotiations. The Second World War ended in\r\nnegotiations; the war in Algeria ended in negotiations\r\nbetween France and the National Liberation Front; the\r\nwar in Viet Nam ended in negotiations between the\r\nhost country here and the Vietnamese; the war between\r\nProtestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, which\r\nhas broken all endurance records, is showing signs of\r\nending soon. How? Through negotiations between the\r\nCatholics and the Protestants.\r\nJust the other day, in reference to another topic, I\r\nmentioned that Security Council resolution 242 (1967)\r\nwas adopted over 40 years ago, but that it is only now\r\nbeginning to be implemented. Now, we are not going to\r\nwait 40 years for our Clinton and our Camp David. The\r\nUnited Nations must implement its resolutions\r\nimmediately. It must support us to ensure that the\r\naggressors, whatever they may say, go home. They are\r\nnot at home. We do not want them in our country. They\r\nmust go home.\r\nThe Second World War erupted after a long\r\nincubation. We now see hope for perpetual peace\r\nfollowing that war, but I agree with Paul Éluard that we\r\nmust be vigilant because the womb that bore the vile\r\nbeast is still fertile. We want all men, even our\r\nenemies, to be our brothers. We want to rebuild our\r\ncountry, which was dismantled by the excesses of\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.19\r\nMobutu. Like Éluard, we want to turn water into light\r\nand, as I said, to make every man our brother.\r\nThat is my message to the Assembly. I repeat: do\r\nnot tell me\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nYou have made a wonderful speech.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nSay We have understood your message and we shall\r\ntell our Governments to implement the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions immediately so that the aggressors\r\ngo home. Please help us to talk with them, in order to\r\nput an end to this war, which should end as all wars\r\nend. Some of us lost all our hair waiting for the blessed\r\nday, 17 May 1997, after 32 years of activity. Look at\r\nPresident Kabilas head and mine; we can be\r\nrecognized by our advanced baldness, which came\r\nabout while we were waiting for the moment when we\r\ncould re-enter Kinshasa.\r\nSo, my African brothers and my brothers from\r\nother countries, including many from Latin America, I\r\nconclude with a Spanish saying. I do not wish to\r\ntranslate it, so those who do not understand will have\r\nto stop a Spanish-speaking colleague and ask What\r\ndid he say?:\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nWhen your neighbours house is on fire, watch out for\r\nyour own house.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
