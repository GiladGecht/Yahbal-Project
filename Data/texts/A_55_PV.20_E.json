(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable John Briceño, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Natural Resources and the Environment of\r\nBelize.\r\nMr. Briceño (Belize): On behalf of the Belize\r\ndelegation, I extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the presidency. Your vast experience in\r\ninternational affairs will greatly aid in our deliberations\r\nduring this fifth-fifth session of the Assembly. We are\r\nenriched by the presence of our newest Member, the\r\nRepublic of Tuvalu; we welcome Tuvalu to our United\r\nNations family with the assurance of Belize\u0027s cooperation\r\nand support.\r\nThe recently concluded Summit, which produced a\r\nprogressive and far-reaching resolution, has set the pace for\r\nour deliberations during this general debate. Although the\r\ngoals are ambitious, their achievement is crucial to the\r\nfuture of the United Nations. In his brief address to the\r\nSummit, my Prime Minister stated:\r\n“we are called to a new appointment with history: to\r\nbring democracy to global governance, to share a\r\nbetter and more productive future where all can live\r\nin dignity and peace.” (A/55/PV.3)\r\nTogether with the goals put forward in the Declaration, this\r\nsets before us an agenda for our way forward.\r\nIn moving forward, we must begin by rededicating\r\nourselves to upholding the fundamental principles of our\r\nCharter, principles which seek freedom from fear and want\r\nin a world where discrimination and hate are eradicated and\r\nthe right of all people to live peaceful, quality lives is\r\nrealized.\r\nThese ideas are as relevant today as they were 55\r\nyears ago. Despite the many advances we have made, many\r\nof us continue to allow our differences to lead to conflict,\r\nwhich results in overwhelming suffering and hinders\r\nhuman development. We must avoid these costly conflicts,\r\nfor without peace we cannot grow.\r\nAt its inception, this institution recognized that peace\r\nand the elimination of war were essential to human\r\ndevelopment. Although we seem to have reduced the\r\nlikelihood of another global conflagration, we continue, at\r\nthe regional and local levels, to allow our differences to\r\ndivide us, resulting in overwhelming suffering, which\r\nfurther hinders progress and development.\r\nAs a global institution, we must actively work to end\r\nall conflict. Our peacekeeping efforts must therefore be\r\nproactive and efficient. Our forces must protect innocent\r\nwomen and children; provide refuge to those who seek to\r\npromote principles of democracy; and rise up against rogue\r\nindividuals and organizations that threaten to undermine\r\ndemocratic Governments. To achieve this, let us first\r\ncommit ourselves to reinforcing the preventive capacity of\r\nthe United Nations peacekeeping forces.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nBelize regards peacekeeping operations as an\r\nimportant component of the United Nations. We agree that\r\nfor our forces to be effective, they must be well equipped\r\nand capable of defending themselves. We continue to meet\r\nthe financial commitments assigned to Belize based on the\r\nprinciple of capacity to pay. We welcome the recent\r\nBrahimi report, which is progressive and takes a\r\ncomprehensive look at our peacekeeping efforts. My\r\ndelegation supports the recommendations it advances.\r\nBelize adheres to the principle of the peaceful\r\nresolution of conflicts, and in this spirit continues to work\r\nwith Guatemala to arrive at a negotiated and peaceful\r\nresolution of our differences. Belize will comply with the\r\nrecently agreed framework established through the\r\nOrganization of American States.\r\nFor some time now, this institution has engaged in a\r\nconversation on development for the future and, more\r\nspecifically, on globalization. For developing countries,\r\nglobalization, as it exists today, poses serious concerns that\r\nseem to fall on the deaf ears of those who continue to push\r\nus along what is obviously a destructive path. While we\r\nwelcome the promises of this new economic order, we\r\ncontinue to fear globalization in its current form, for what\r\nwe have seen so far is neither responsible nor sustainable. It\r\nis not sustainable because those who lead the way seek only\r\nthe advancement of their personal interests.\r\nThe proponents of globalization advised that market\r\nliberalization would lead to prosperity. We were\r\nencouraged to transform our economies and create more\r\neffective and efficient government. We have tried, and\r\ncontinue to try, to do so. However, our call for assistance\r\nwith this transformation has not always been heard.\r\nHowever, much of what has been asked of most of us, we\r\nhave done. The fact that today in Central America and the\r\nCaribbean every nation is legislated by a democratically\r\nelected Government and that we have opened our borders,\r\nmarkets and lifestyles to others, demonstrates our\r\ncommitment to transparency and effective governance.\r\nIn Belize, we have done our part to ensure equitable\r\ndevelopment. We enjoy a vibrant and working democracy\r\nwhere 85 per cent of our voting population exercise their\r\nfranchise to vote; we have an open economy where all are\r\nencouraged to participate; and we have formed partnerships\r\nwith civil society to address social needs and protect our\r\nprecious environment. We have been responsible, yet all\r\nwe see of globalization is the threat of the elimination of\r\nour current economic sustenance. If this is the legacy of\r\nglobalization, then those of us who have suffered at the\r\nhands of this new order must ask if globalization today is\r\nresponsible, if it is good. We continue to believe that it can\r\nbe.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nIn the current economic order, small economies such\r\nas ours can aspire to a productive future only if the\r\narchitects of this new modality provide us with the\r\nnecessary assistance. Developed countries must commit\r\nthemselves to a process of globalization that is not only\r\nfree, but fair. Just as they request the opening up of our\r\nmarkets, such institutions and the administrators of\r\nglobalization must be more open, democratic and\r\nrepresentative. Thus, just as we work with civil society to\r\nhelp us to deal with our political and social needs, they\r\nmust work together with the international civil agencies so\r\nthat the needs of the poorest can be provided for. We will\r\nnever achieve the objective of just world if poverty\r\ncontinues to affect our people. The eradication of poverty is\r\nour moral duty.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe agree that true sustainable development cannot\r\noccur without the protection and preservation of our\r\nenvironment. This must be a path that combines the efforts\r\nof all nations. We in Belize understand that we have a\r\nglobal responsibility to protect our natural resources. That\r\nis why we are signatories to the Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change and are in the process of signing the Kyoto\r\nProtocol. However, our efforts can be effective only if\r\nothers are equally committed. We encourage our developed\r\npartners to continue to honour the commitments they made\r\nin Rio to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a\r\ntimely manner. Currently, over 40 per cent of Belizean land\r\nis under protected status, our precious coral reefs are\r\nclosely monitored and our tropical rain forests carefully\r\nmanaged. Together with local non-governmental\r\norganizations, we are seeking an adequate balance between\r\nthe protection of our natural resources and the fulfilment of\r\nthe development needs of our people, while agreeing that\r\nour environmental protectionism must work in harmony\r\nwith our developmental needs.\r\nMuch has been accomplished over the past year. On\r\nsocial issues, we reaffirmed our commitment to the\r\ndevelopment of women during the Beijing + 5 conference.\r\nThe Copenhagen + 5 conference addressed the need for\r\ngreater social development and, together with our partners\r\nin the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Belize actively\r\nparticipated in the Review Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\n(NPT). Belize continues to push for an end to the shipping\r\nof nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea.\r\nThese successes, however, should not distract us from\r\nthe suffering and injustices still being endured by millions\r\nof people. In Africa the situation in Angola, Sierra Leone\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerns us.\r\nThe spread of the HIV/AIDS virus is alarming; we must do\r\nwhat is necessary to assist those afflicted.\r\nWe are troubled by the situation in Timor. The\r\nrecent events, which resulted in the death of United\r\nNations peacekeeping personnel, were tragic. We also\r\nlearned of the death of another United Nations official\r\nin Guinea. We condemn these acts, and join with the\r\nSecretary-General in expressing our condolences to the\r\nfamilies of those who gave their lives for the cause of\r\npeace.\r\nBelize joins others in support of the Middle East\r\npeace process. We continue to support the right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination. Likewise, we\r\ncall upon this Organization to recognize the desire of\r\nthe 23 million people of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan for the opportunity to contribute and participate\r\nin the work of this Organization and other international\r\nbodies.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration, adopted by our\r\nheads of State and Government, reminds us of our\r\nresponsibility to protect those fundamental values such\r\nas freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for\r\nnature and responsibility. It calls for collective action\r\nto be undertaken by developed and developing nations\r\nto advance the cause of peace, protect our children and\r\npreserve the planet for future generations. These are\r\ngoals that can be achieved through greater inclusion\r\nand genuine concern for each other. We must find new\r\nways of thinking to help us reform these institutions,\r\nwhich create inequality and therefore divide us. Let us\r\ncommit ourselves to reducing redundancy, eliminating\r\nwaste and refining our responsiveness to Member\r\nneeds, but let us do it quickly.\r\nThe United Nations is our truest form of global\r\nrepresentation. It possesses the capacity to elicit the\r\nbest from all of us. Together, our ability to accomplish\r\nthese ideals set out in the Millennium Declaration is\r\npossible. Let us rededicate ourselves to its fulfilment.\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ethiopia, His Excellency Mr. Seyoum\r\nMesfin.\r\nMr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): Allow me, from the\r\noutset, to extend warm congratulations to you,\r\nMr. President, on your election to preside over the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I would\r\nlike also to express our appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the able\r\nmanner with which he discharged his responsibilities as\r\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI wish also to take this opportunity to express our\r\nsincere appreciation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for all the efforts he has been making to make\r\nthe United Nations equally relevant to all of us. I wish,\r\nin particular, to congratulate him on the success of the\r\nMillennium Summit, which we are hopeful will be a\r\nlandmark for more meaningful and enhanced\r\ncooperation among nations.\r\nWe have indeed been encouraged by the well-\r\ndeserved emphasis that was given to Africa and to\r\nAfrica’s predicament at the Millennium Summit. It is\r\nour hope that the Summit may have helped create\r\ngreater determination for cooperation with the peoples\r\nof Africa so that Africa may make real progress in\r\naddressing the challenges of development, peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThe problems of Africa are defined by two very\r\nclosely related challenges. Africa’s development\r\ncontinues to be arrested by problems of insecurity,\r\ninstability and lack of peace. On the other hand, it\r\nappears unrealistic to expect durable peace in Africa\r\nwithout hope in the future that could be brought about\r\nonly by visible indications of possibilities for progress.\r\nIn both areas, Africa has not had the necessary\r\nsupport commensurate with the complexity of the\r\nchallenges it has faced. It might be necessary to hasten\r\nto add here that indeed Africa itself might not always\r\nhave taken advantage of available opportunities for\r\nmaking progress, and that we might sometimes have\r\nsquandered real opportunities for breaking out of the\r\nvicious cycle of poverty and lack of peace and stability.\r\nWhile this may be partly true, the significance of\r\nthe missed chances that Africa has allowed to pass\r\nshould not be exaggerated. It is far from the truth that\r\nAfrica has enjoyed sustained, resolute and all-out\r\nsupport, either in the area of economic development or\r\nin the sphere of peace and security. On the other hand,\r\nit is precisely this type of cooperation that is required\r\nby many in Africa to be able to embark on sustainable\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\neconomic development and growth. But whether with\r\nrespect to debt relief, or to declining terms of trade, or\r\nto all aspects of the challenges of and obstacles to\r\ndevelopment, the types of cooperation made available\r\nto our countries have always been limited as well as\r\nentangled with all kinds of conditions which have been\r\nfar from helpful.\r\nLike all regions of the world and like all\r\ncountries, Africa and African nations should and must\r\nassume primary responsibility for what happens in\r\nAfrica in general and in individual African countries.\r\nBut at one time or another in their history, most regions\r\nof the world and most countries have had occasions to\r\nrely on international solidarity and cooperation as a\r\ncatalyst for creating conditions for development and\r\nstability.\r\nBut Africa’s fate has been different. For whatever\r\nreason, it has been easier to lose hope with respect to\r\nAfrica than to give the continent the benefit of the\r\ndoubt; this, even when little has been done to help\r\nAfrica address the real challenges it is facing in a\r\nvariety of areas.\r\nThis is not only in the area of economic\r\ndevelopment. We have seen the same thing taking place\r\nwith respect to the need for Africa to promote respect\r\nfor the rule of law and to create conditions for peace\r\nand stability. Africa is also being marginalized in terms\r\nof the universal applicability of the principles of\r\ninternational law. It is our hope that Africa will be\r\njudged by the same standard in this regard. Otherwise,\r\nthere can be little chance for peace and stability in our\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe say this from experience. There is no\r\neffective substitute, if opportunities are to be created\r\nfor the peaceful resolution of situations of crisis in\r\nAfrica and for a quick and an appropriate response by\r\nthe international community to violations of\r\ninternational law. Peace can never be promoted through\r\nappeasement of aggression or by creating the\r\nimpression that, depending on circumstances, on where\r\nthey take place and to whom they happen, some acts of\r\naggression can be tolerated.\r\nWe in Ethiopia have, only a week ago, celebrated\r\nour New Year. We have entered the year 1993 with\r\nconfidence that it will be a year of peace and progress.\r\nOur people have made the commitment to resume the\r\ntask of economic development with full force, a task\r\nwhich was rudely interrupted two years ago when our\r\ncountry became a victim of aggression.\r\nIt is also in this spirit that we are proceeding with\r\nfull commitment to put behind us the crisis we have\r\nhad with Eritrea. Even before the deployment of\r\npeacekeepers, contrary to experience in other places,\r\nthe cessation of hostilities has held for months now. We\r\nlook forward both to the deployment of the\r\npeacekeepers and to a speedy conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive settlement. All those prepared to\r\ncontribute to this effort should rest assured that what\r\nthey should expect from Ethiopia, its people and their\r\nGovernment, is the fullest cooperation. For us,\r\nagreements concluded are made to be respected, not\r\nviolated. In any case, what our people wish to be\r\nidentified with, fully and with no ambiguity, is\r\npeacemaking, not war-making. We hope that we will\r\nhave the opportunity to work for peace and for\r\neconomic growth and development.\r\nThere are few who need the blessings of peace\r\nmore than the people of Ethiopia and of our subregion.\r\nAs much as our people refuse to see aggression\r\nrewarded at their expense, they have, on the other\r\nhand, never been wanting in demonstrating full\r\ncommitment to peace and legality. Our people will\r\nnever jettison this noble tradition.\r\nEthiopia also takes its responsibility for peace\r\nand stability in our subregion very seriously and in\r\nAfrica as a whole. In this regard, we have been\r\nenormously encouraged by the developments with\r\nrespect to the peace initiative on Somalia under the\r\nauspices of President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti.\r\nIt is Ethiopia’s hope that what has already been\r\nachieved in Djibouti will be built upon and that the\r\nmomentum for peace and national reconciliation will\r\nbe maintained. We are convinced that if the remaining\r\nproblems are handled with realism, wisdom and mutual\r\naccommodation, there is little doubt that the people of\r\nSomalia will very soon be able to put behind them the\r\n10-year nightmare they have faced. I would like,\r\ntherefore, to take this opportunity to call on all\r\nconcerned to make this newly created opportunity for\r\npeace in Somalia, and for the restoration of the Somali\r\nState, irreversible. The process should not be allowed\r\nto be held hostage by those who may not be prepared\r\nfor national reconciliation. Nor should it be endangered\r\nby a failure to be sufficiently accommodating and\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nsufficiently patient. This is what the international\r\ncommunity should encourage.\r\nThe opportunity now created in Somalia should\r\nnot be allowed to slip away. This could easily happen if\r\nall attention is focused on seeking international\r\nlegitimacy rather than internal national reconciliation.\r\nIt would indeed be a tragedy and a recipe for further\r\nbloodshed in Somalia if efforts are not made to build\r\non the peace and stability that have already been\r\nachieved by some regions and parts of Somalia. The\r\nissue of Somaliland, for instance, requires great\r\nsensitivity and a sense of enormous responsibility.\r\nWhatever has been achieved in Djibouti is going to be\r\ntested by how well the peace and stability that some\r\nparts of Somalia have achieved is preserved.\r\nFor Ethiopia, and for Somalia’s neighbours, these\r\nare critical issues. The formal stand we will be taking\r\nwith respect to the evolving situation in Somalia will\r\ndepend on how these issues are addressed by those who\r\nnow have the chance to affect the destiny of the people\r\nof Somalia. While we wish them well and promise\r\nthem our full cooperation, we also ask them to use this\r\nhistoric opportunity with a full sense of responsibility\r\nand wisdom.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to also state that\r\nEthiopia, along with its Inter-Government Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) partners, will continue to do the\r\nmaximum possible for peace and national\r\nreconciliation in the Sudan. It has always been our firm\r\nconviction that the Declaration of Principles provides a\r\njust and realistic basis for reaching a settlement on the\r\ncrisis in southern Sudan. It is also our view that a\r\nbroader national reconciliation in the Sudan can easily\r\nbe achieved on the basis of democratic principles and\r\nmutual accommodation. Ethiopia will continue to be\r\ncommitted to peace in the Sudan on this basis and to\r\ncooperate with all those who have the goodwill to\r\ncontribute to peace in our subregion.\r\nLet me reiterate: Ethiopia will do the maximum\r\npossible for peace and durable stability in Africa as a\r\nwhole, with the full knowledge that without peace we\r\nin Africa will have little chance to ensure a better\r\nfuture for our peoples.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to say a few\r\nwords on how vital it is that the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil be completed as speedily as possible. The\r\nreform of the Council is critical for the credibility of\r\nthe United Nations and for its increased legitimacy. As\r\nmatters stand now, it is only too obvious that not many\r\nbelieve that the work of the Security Council is\r\nconducted with sufficient transparency. In fact, there is\r\na growing conviction that the Council is being less and\r\nless representative and more and more distant from the\r\nsentiments of the majority.\r\nThis situation, we believe, needs to be rectified.\r\nThis can be done in two ways. First, by ensuring that\r\nthere is equitable representation of all regions of the\r\nworld on the Council. Secondly, it is also important\r\nthat the work of the Council be made more open and its\r\ndecision-making more transparent. The interests of\r\npeace and security will be better served if the Council\r\nis more transparent and more open to the views of\r\nothers, most particularly to the views of those directly\r\naffected by its decisions.\r\nIt is our earnest hope that the United Nations will\r\nbe more relevant to all in the twenty-first century, and\r\nin equal measure, than it has been in the past 55 years.\r\nThis is not an unrealistic objective, but it requires the\r\ncommitment of all, big and small.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Igor Ivanov.\r\nMr. Ivanov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Millennium Summit has given all of us\r\nthe priority task of establishing a new and equitable\r\nworld order — an order which would meet the interests\r\nof all and every member of the international\r\ncommunity and ensure adequate solutions to the\r\nproblems with which the twenty-first century is\r\nconfronting us.\r\nI am convinced that in this era of globalization\r\nand enormous scientific and technological progress,\r\nhumankind can and should have a comprehensive and\r\nforward-looking strategy. While in the past century\r\nhuman civilization’s main task was that of survival,\r\ntoday we are confronted with significantly more\r\ndifficult problems which are much more varied in\r\nterms of their scope and orientation.\r\nThe strategy of survival must give way to a\r\nstrategy of sustainable development aimed at ensuring\r\nthe prosperity of humankind. It must be based on the\r\nrecognition of the indivisibility of international\r\nsecurity, the use of modern scientific and technological\r\nachievements for the benefit of the entire international\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\ncommunity, and a gradual closing of the development\r\ngap between the various States.\r\nThese ambitious goals can be achieved only\r\nthrough the preservation and strengthening of strategic\r\nstability in its very broadest sense.\r\nStrategic stability means further progress in the\r\ndisarmament process, reliable prevention of the spread\r\nof weapons of mass destruction. Today nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation are no longer the\r\nsubject of exclusive interaction between Russia, the\r\nUnited States and other nuclear Powers. What is\r\nneeded is the effective involvement of multilateral\r\nUnited Nations mechanisms and the entire world\r\ncommunity in those processes.\r\nThe outcome of the Millennium Summit provides\r\nadditional opportunities for the achievement of a major\r\nbreakthrough in disarmament in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. This will require consistent joint efforts aimed\r\nat strict compliance with the agreements already\r\nconcluded; a step-by-step reduction and eventual\r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction under\r\neffective international control, and the limitation of\r\nother types of armaments; and prevention of the arms\r\nrace in new spheres.\r\nThe time has come to give a new impetus to the\r\nwork of the Conference on Disarmament, which has\r\nproved in practice the effectiveness of multilateral\r\ndiplomacy under the auspices of the United Nations.\r\nRussia advocates the resumption of substantive work at\r\nthat forum on major issues on the disarmament agenda.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) provides an indispensable international\r\nlegal basis for nuclear disarmament. This has once\r\nagain been reaffirmed in full by the 2000 Review\r\nConference. Russia will work to ensure that the\r\ndecisions of the Millennium Assembly promote the\r\npractical implementation of the agreements reached\r\nduring that Conference. It is precisely for that purpose\r\nthat the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir\r\nPutin, put forward an initiative on the development and\r\nimplementation, under the auspices of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), of an international\r\nproject designed to phase out the use of enriched\r\nuranium and pure plutonium in the civilian nuclear\r\nenergy sector.\r\nWe are satisfied to note the increasing number of\r\nStates acceding to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT). Its speedy entry into force is in the interests of\r\nthe entire international community. Having ratified the\r\nTreaty, we call on those that have yet not done so to\r\nfollow suit.\r\nWe expect that the United States will follow\r\nRussia in completing ratification of the Treaty on the\r\nFurther Reduction and Limitation of Strategic\r\nOffensive Arms (START II), which will help make it\r\noperational. We are ready to actively continue the\r\nprocess of nuclear disarmament and to move towards\r\nthe conclusion of a START III Treaty with an even\r\nlower threshold of nuclear warheads — down to 1,500\r\nunits. But this will be feasible only if the 1972 Anti-\r\nBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty remains intact. It is\r\nuniversally acknowledged that this major Treaty\r\nconcerns the vital security interests of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. Its preservation is a key\r\nelement of global stability and a strong barrier to the\r\narms race in regard to nuclear weapons, missiles and\r\nother weapons of mass destruction.\r\nRussia will be introducing a draft resolution in\r\nsupport of the ABM Treaty. We hope that, as was the\r\ncase last year, our initiative will receive broad support\r\nwithin the United Nations.\r\nA peaceful earth needs a peaceful outer space. At\r\nthe Millennium Summit the President of Russia\r\nproposed the convening in Moscow of an international\r\nconference on the prevention of the weaponization of\r\nouter space, to take place in the spring of 2001, when\r\nthe fortieth anniversary of the first manned flight to\r\nouter space is to be commemorated. We hope that this\r\nproposal will be actively supported.\r\nStrategic stability means reliable safeguarding of\r\ninternational information security and counteracting\r\nthe use of scientific and technological achievements for\r\npurposes incompatible with universal progress and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace. Aware of the great\r\nimportance of resolving these most urgent issues,\r\nRussia will introduce for consideration by the General\r\nAssembly a draft resolution entitled “Developments in\r\nthe field of informatization and telecommunications in\r\nthe context of international information security”.\r\nStrategic stability also means enhancing peace\r\nand security on all continents, settling existing regional\r\nconflicts and preventing new ones and cutting off\r\nexternal support for them. Millions of people must be\r\nspared the death and suffering caused by local crises.\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nHow can this goal be achieved? It is only through\r\nthe joint efforts of all States collectively responsible\r\nfor the world’s destiny. Experience has shown that\r\nunilateral enforcement actions cannot guarantee a\r\nlasting and fair settlement of crisis situations.\r\nThe notions of sovereignty and the territorial\r\nintegrity of States are still very much alive. Disregard\r\nfor these principles and military intervention\r\ncircumventing the Security Council, whatever\r\nhumanitarian pretexts may be used, undermine the very\r\nfoundations of the world order and pave the way for\r\narbitrariness in international affairs.\r\nThe prevention and settlement of crises should\r\nbecome a key element of international security in the\r\ntwenty-first century. When there is collective\r\ndetermination and goodwill, even the most complex\r\nand major problems lend themselves to a political\r\nresolution.\r\nAll of this calls for improvement of the\r\npeacekeeping potential of our Organization. People in\r\n“hotbeds” of the planet — from Africa and Lebanon to\r\nEast Timor — rightly associate with the United Nations\r\n“Blue Helmets” their hopes for an end to bloody\r\nconflicts and for the beginning of complex\r\nreconciliation processes. They expect rapid and\r\neffective steps from us.\r\nWe hope that the Millennium Assembly will\r\nprovide us with an opportunity to engage in a\r\ncomprehensive analysis of the work of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping mechanisms and outline ways to increase\r\ntheir efficiency. Such is the objective of the report\r\n(A/55/305) prepared under the aegis of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral by the Brahimi Panel. It is important to\r\nconsiderably enhance the United Nations capacity for\r\nthe prompt deployment of peacekeeping operations.\r\nThis can be done through the early completion of the\r\nsystem of standby arrangements. Peacekeeping units of\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat need to be strengthened,\r\nwith provision for professional planning, control and\r\ncommand of operations.\r\nRussia consistently advocates the expansion of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nstructures in the field of peacekeeping. Chapter VIII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter remains the basis for such\r\ninteraction. Any regional or “coalition” operation\r\nshould be conducted under conditions of transparency\r\nand of reporting to the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil, whereas operations with enforcement\r\nelements should be carried out only with the\r\nauthorization of the Security Council.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\r\nis a major regional partner of the United Nations in\r\npeacekeeping. In many respects, it was the close\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CIS\r\nthat made it possible to successfully resolve the\r\nconflict in Tajikistan. Such interaction will\r\nundoubtedly intensify along with the development of\r\nthe CIS anti-crisis potential. At the same time, for a\r\nstable peace to prevail in the conflict-affected regions\r\nin the CIS area the volume of international economic\r\nand humanitarian aid for their rehabilitation should be\r\nincreased.\r\nRussia attaches primary importance to the\r\nexpansion of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional and subregional mechanisms in Africa to\r\nprovide for more effective crisis response on the\r\ncontinent. This is evidenced by the Russian\r\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations in a number of\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nThe entire experience of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping activities in recent years clearly shows\r\nthe priority of political and diplomatic methods of\r\nconflict settlement. It is precisely these methods that\r\nmake it possible to minimize the suffering of the\r\ncivilian population and to find ways to a stable peace.\r\nStrategic stability means the security and\r\ntranquillity of civil society and of the individual. This\r\ntask can be accomplished only through the combined\r\nefforts of the international community to counter\r\ncontemporary threats and challenges. These include,\r\ninter alia, aggressive separatism and religious\r\nextremism, illicit arms trafficking and organized crime.\r\nSuch an abhorrent manifestation of extremism as\r\ninternational terrorism poses a direct threat to security\r\nand stability. Today, terrorists of every stripe\r\nsometimes act in a more organized fashion than does\r\nthe world community confronting them. We expect that\r\nthe United Nations will step up its mobilization of\r\ninternational capacities to counteract terrorism. Such\r\ncooperation must be based on the clear principles set\r\nforth in the Security Council resolution 1269 (1999):\r\nno support whatsoever, no safe havens for terrorists,\r\nthe inevitability of punishment for every terrorist act.\r\nAs to those who violate these principles the Security\r\nCouncil must be ready to take measures against them\r\nprovided for in the United Nations Charter.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nRussia intends to ratify the Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Financing elaborated under\r\nUnited Nations auspices. There is an urgent need to\r\ncomplete work on the convention for the suppression of\r\nacts of nuclear terrorism, and that work on a\r\ncomprehensive anti-terrorism convention should be\r\nstepped up.\r\nTerrorism is often closely linked with drug\r\ntrafficking and organized crime. We welcome the\r\ncompletion of the development of an international\r\nconvention against organized crime. Russia intends to\r\nsign it in the nearest future. We also support the\r\nproposal on drafting an international convention on the\r\nfight against corruption.\r\nStrategic stability means promoting human rights\r\nand freedoms everywhere. This area is an important\r\ncomponent of the United Nations activities aimed at\r\nestablishing a new world order based on international\r\nlaw.\r\nRussia contributes significantly to strengthening\r\nthe universal legal regime. Our country has signed the\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nSpeaking of pooling the efforts of States to\r\nresolve the twofold task of maintaining international\r\nsecurity and ensuring human security, human rights and\r\nfreedoms, we should constantly bear in mind that in the\r\ntwentieth century the rule of the ideology of racial\r\nhatred cost mankind scores of millions of human lives.\r\nUnfortunately, today, 55 years after the great victory it\r\nis still premature to speak of total eradication of the\r\nbacillus of national superiority.\r\nWe cannot accept a situation in which people do\r\nnot have the right to use their mother tongue, are\r\ndeprived of their citizenship and jobs on ethnic\r\ngrounds, when fighters against fascism are put behind\r\nbars while former fascists find favour with the\r\nauthorities. The Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nshould firmly respond to all such manifestations.\r\nStrategic stability must be based on a solid\r\nmaterial foundation. The twenty-first century will go\r\ndown in history as the century of mankind’s\r\nbreakthrough to a qualitatively new level of\r\ndevelopment only if we manage to preserve peace and\r\ninternational security and at the same time impart\r\nnecessary dynamism and depth to the process of\r\neconomic and technological equalization between the\r\nenormous number of developing countries and the\r\ncomparatively small group of leading countries. This\r\ngoal cannot be achieved overnight. This will require —\r\nunder the unifying and guiding hand of the United\r\nNations — a mechanism for collective democratic\r\nmanagement of the international monetary, trade and\r\neconomic systems. They must become more rational\r\nand fair and be targeted against poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nIt is important to make the most of those\r\nopportunities which have been opened up by the new\r\ntechnological revolution in order to initiate the process\r\nof bridging the gap in the levels of development.\r\nInformation and communications technologies whose\r\npotential for speeding up global development is only\r\ncomparable to the invention of written language can\r\nserve as a driving force of that process. A chance has\r\nemerged to skip over several traditional stages of\r\ndevelopment through the introduction of global\r\ncomputer literacy and information technologies.\r\nMankind, equipped with this powerful instrument, will\r\nobtain a real opportunity to begin creating conditions\r\nfor a decent life and the all-around development of\r\nhuman beings everywhere on earth.\r\nStrategic stability means the preservation of a\r\nclean and healthy environment for the present and\r\nfuture generations. The United Nations has done a\r\ngreat deal to mobilize international efforts in that\r\nimportant field. The “Rio+10” Forum, to be held in\r\n2002, will provide an opportunity not only to sum up\r\nthe results of those activities but also to outline a\r\nfuture-oriented follow-up programme.\r\nRussia supports the expansion of international\r\ncooperation within the United Nations framework in\r\nthe areas of biodiversity, climate, combating\r\ndesertification, as well as of forest preservation.\r\nThe recent increase over the last few years in the\r\nnumber of natural and man-made disasters and the\r\nconsequent growth of the scope of human and material\r\nlosses have made disaster management one of the most\r\nformidable global challenges facing mankind. While\r\nintensifying the United Nations efforts to promote\r\ninternational cooperation in this field, special attention\r\nmust be paid to the use of state-of-the-art specialized\r\ntechnologies for disaster management and to the search\r\nfor innovative mechanisms for their use in the interests\r\nof the entire international community.\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nThe United Nations — a unique universal forum\r\nin every respect, which has demonstrated in practice its\r\ncentral role in managing international affairs — should\r\nbecome a guarantor of such comprehensive strategic\r\nstability. Russia welcomes the consensus reached at the\r\nMillennium Summit on consolidating the United\r\nNations as the axis of the present world order. The time\r\nhas come for concrete collective measures to transform\r\nthe Organization into a sort of operational headquarters\r\nfor coordinating activities aimed at ensuring a new\r\nstrategic stability based on the principles of\r\nmultilateralism, equality and solidarity in resolving\r\nglobal problems.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize once\r\nagain that the Russian Federation, for its part, is open\r\nto the closest interaction with all members of the\r\ninternational community in order to make strategic\r\nstability a cornerstone of the world order in the twenty-\r\nfirst century and the United Nations its reliable\r\nguarantor.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Shlomo Ben-Ami, Acting Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Israel.\r\nMr. Ben-Ami (Israel): I stand here today as\r\nIsrael’s messenger of peace. The establishment of the\r\nState of Israel was the fulfilment of the dream of a\r\npeople forced into exile 2,000 years ago. The\r\ndestruction of the Second Temple and the dissolution\r\nof Jewish statehood were the result of our failure as a\r\nnation to assume the proper political course, to opt for\r\naccommodation with reality instead of engaging in\r\nmessianic hallucinations. Our punishment was very\r\nsevere indeed, but maybe it can serve as a lesson to\r\nthose nations and leaders who today may be tragically\r\nled to believe that the dangerous inertia of romantic\r\nmythology and unrealistic dreams is preferable to the\r\nbanality of a wise and prudent political course.\r\nMost revolts are uprisings against a system.\r\nZionism was a revolt against destiny. It is this\r\nexpression of our re-encounter with the world of\r\npolitical realities that eventually led us to the\r\nrestoration of Jewish statehood in 1948. Tragically,\r\nhowever, historical and geopolitical circumstances\r\nhave put us in a prolonged, bitter conflict with the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nIt was thanks to the leadership of Prime Minister\r\nRabin and Chairman Arafat that, seven years ago,\r\nPalestinians and Israelis were put on a track leading to\r\npeace and reconciliation. We have been engaged in the\r\npast seven years, but more intensely in the last year, in\r\na major effort, unprecedented in both scope and depth,\r\nto resolve this 100-year-old conflict. This negotiating\r\nprocess, and it alone, should be the foundation of a\r\npeace agreement.\r\nAt this point, I would like to address my\r\ncolleagues from the Arab and Muslim world. I hope\r\nthat my words will convince them of the Israeli\r\nGovernment’s sincere intentions to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive peace based on respect, dignity and\r\nfairness, which will end the Middle East conflict and\r\nbest serve the vital interests of the entire region.\r\nThe Jewish people have no quarrel with Islam.\r\nOn the contrary, we have the deepest respect for that\r\ngreat Islamic civilization under whose wings Jewish\r\nhistory — from Al-Andalus to Turkey, from Egypt to\r\nIraq, from the Jewish quarters of Tangier to Aleppo in\r\nSyria — has known some of its finest hours and most\r\nglorious cultural achievements. But even at the height\r\nof the “Golden Age”, in the midst of the delights and\r\nwonders of Muslim Spain, our people never abandoned\r\ntheir dream of and yearning for Jerusalem, as expressed\r\nin the words of the poet Yehuda Halevi more than 800\r\nyears ago:\r\n“My heart is in the East, and I am in the furthest\r\nreaches of the West. To thee my soul yearns from\r\nthe depth of the West.”\r\nWe are a small nation decimated by holocaust and\r\ndispersion, but our heritage is rich. It was from our\r\neternal capital, Jerusalem — which, according to a\r\nMuslim source,\r\n“in the days of the people of Israel, was an area\r\nlarger than Cairo and Baghdad” —\r\nthat the message of monotheism was projected to\r\nhumanity. The Jewish holy sites and shrines in\r\nJerusalem are the very heart of the Jewish faith,\r\nidentity and history. For the past 2,000 years, Jews\r\nhave turned towards Temple Mount in prayer three\r\ntimes a day.\r\n“If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand\r\nforget its cunning. Let my tongue cleave to the\r\nroof of my mouth if I do not recall thee”,\r\nthey pledged in joy and in sorrow.\r\nFor the past 30 years, Israel has consistently\r\ndemonstrated its commitment to freedom of religion\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nand worship in Jerusalem. Heads of the various\r\nreligious denominations in Jerusalem will attest to the\r\nfact that the city has never been so open to all\r\nbelievers. During the last month of Ramadan, a record\r\nnumber, unheard of in the annals of Islam in Jerusalem,\r\nof more than 400,000 Muslim worshippers attended\r\nFriday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\r\nI note this as an example of the deep respect\r\nwhich Israel has for Islam and its followers. Just as we\r\ndo not question the sincerity of the sentiments of others\r\ntowards their holy sites in Jerusalem, we expect that\r\nothers will not question the Jewish people’s deep, awe-\r\ninspired attachment to Jerusalem and its holy sites,\r\nfrom which we will never again be parted.\r\nPoliticians need not distort God’s intentions for\r\nthe sake of negotiations. How refreshing it is that a\r\ngreat number of Muslim scholars should attest to the\r\nfact that, as the Supreme Court Judge Mujir el-din al-\r\nHanbali wrote in his History of Jerusalem and Hebron,\r\n“David reigned for 40 years and before he died he\r\npassed the monarchy on to his son Solomon and\r\ntold him to build the beit al-miqdas —  the\r\nTemple”.\r\nThe expression beit al-miqdas —  that is, the House of\r\nthe Temple — became in many Muslim sources a\r\nsynonym of the word “Jerusalem”.\r\nIt is a travesty of historical truth to present the\r\nPalestinian refugee problem as the result of mass\r\nexpulsion. There is no denying, however, that once the\r\nJews — who for thousands of years waited with\r\nhumility for their redemption — made their re-\r\nencounter with history as a sovereign nation, they had\r\nto assume the inherent immorality of war. The\r\nsuffering of the civilian population will always be a\r\nburden on the conscience of any nation at war. The\r\nArab-Israeli conflict has no monopoly on this maxim.\r\nClearly, the Palestinian refugees were victims of the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict. Israel, however, can assume\r\nneither political nor moral responsibility for this\r\ntragedy that was the direct result of the all-out\r\nonslaught against reborn Israel — an onslaught\r\nlaunched by the Arab armies in 1948. The Palestinian\r\nrefugee problem was born as the land was bisected by\r\nthe sword — not by design, Jewish or Arab. The\r\nproblem was largely the inevitable by-product of Arab\r\nand Jewish fears and the protracted bitter fighting.\r\nWe believe that, once established, it is the\r\nPalestinian State that should provide for the vindication\r\nof the Palestinian claim for the right of return. The\r\nnotion is preposterous that a nation should create a\r\nState only in order to gather its exiles in a\r\nneighbouring State. Israel, however, has expressed its\r\nwillingness to actively participate in any international\r\neffort and fund aimed at providing the financial\r\nfoundations for the resolution of the refugee problem.\r\nOut of humanitarian considerations, Israel may also\r\naccept a small and limited number of refugees within a\r\nscheme of family reunification.\r\nLet there be no doubt. The peace process is not\r\nthe objective, we need not sanctify the process. Peace,\r\nnot the process, is the objective. Peace is not about\r\nmore conventions, summits and resolutions; it is about\r\nthe future of our children, and about the seemingly\r\nunattractive banalities of building the mechanisms of\r\ncohabitation.\r\nTo the Palestinians we say: we need to\r\ndisentangle ourselves from this seemingly insoluble\r\nconundrum. We know that unless your and our wounds\r\nare healed, peace — not only the political peace but\r\nalso that of the mind and the conscience — will not be\r\ncomplete. Yet, at the same time we realize that the total\r\nsatisfaction of our respective dreams or presumed\r\nrights will lead us to perdition. Hence it is incumbent\r\non us to devise realistic ways to heal without opening\r\nnew wounds, to dignify our existence as free peoples\r\nwithout putting into jeopardy the collective existence\r\nof each other. Peace is not about twisting each other’s\r\narms; it is about defining a common interest. I believe\r\nthat such an ideal compromise is not impossible to\r\nachieve, while banishing the sword from this land of\r\nGod.\r\nPeace has not materialized in full yet, but I\r\nbelieve that we are moving in the right direction. In the\r\npast year the Government of Prime Minister Ehud\r\nBarak has made bold, courageous and unprecedented\r\nmoves towards peace. At Camp David we have\r\ncontemplated ideas and explored concepts relating to\r\nthe most sensitive and supposedly intractable issues.\r\nOur sense is that breakthrough is possible, just as\r\nfailure may lead to breakdown. We have turned the sea\r\nthat separated us into a river. But, do we have the\r\ncourage and the determination to cross it?\r\nI know I may not sound too objective by\r\nvouching for Prime Minister Barak. But, I have come\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nhere with the power of conviction that no Prime\r\nMinister before him — and let no illusions be\r\nharboured, no Prime Minister after him — will touch as\r\nhe has the outer limits of his options as an Israeli and a\r\nJew.\r\nI do not underestimate the dilemmas facing\r\nChairman Arafat. He is the great leader of the\r\nPalestinian people, and I know that the decision is not\r\neasy for him either. But this is the destiny of leaders: to\r\nalways be prophets without honour. They should not\r\nexpect the applause of their constituencies, what really\r\nmatters is the judgement of future generations. I call\r\nupon our Palestinian partners to realize that history has\r\nbrought us to a moment of truth and decision from\r\nwhich we are not allowed to escape empty-handed\r\nwithout inflicting severe punishments on our own\r\npeoples.\r\nIsrael aspires to achieve a comprehensive peace\r\nin the region and help move it into the future. Twenty\r\none years ago we signed a cornerstone peace treaty\r\nwith Egypt, followed by a peace treaty with Jordan and\r\nan incipient but promising process of normalization\r\nwith the Maghreb and Gulf States. Eighteen years of\r\nIsraeli military presence in Lebanon have been\r\nterminated by the Barak Government, in close\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, and thanks\r\nespecially to the efforts and dedication of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan. We have also delved into the\r\npossibilities of reaching peace with Syria. We hope that\r\ntalks with Syria will resume as soon as possible and\r\nthat a fair and equitable agreement can be achieved.\r\nIsrael is determined to pursue peace and take the\r\ncalculated risks attached to it. But Israel will not\r\ncompromise — not now and not ever — on those\r\nsecurity and national interests that we deem vital.\r\nWhile building our peace with the Palestinians we\r\ncannot ignore security concerns inherent in the fact that\r\npeace with the Palestinians is not our last peace. We\r\nstill have a dispute pending with Syria, and we are still\r\nexposed to the most serious regional threats emanating\r\nfrom revolutionary powers in the area.\r\nPeace requires the active involvement of the\r\ninternational community. The critical role played by\r\nthe United States, and especially the relentless\r\ndedication and unequivocal commitment of President\r\nBill Clinton, has been massive and constructive. Once\r\nagain the United States has proven to be the\r\nindispensable nation. We have also seen the European\r\nUnion rising to the task, and we commend the role of\r\nthe French Presidency and that of other key European\r\nGovernments. Peace needs the advice of the\r\ninternational community and it will need that support\r\nto cement peace once it is achieved.\r\nWe expect also to work closely with the Egyptian\r\nGovernment for the cause of regional peace. I believe\r\nthat it is also important that Russia and the Arab world\r\nexpress their opinions that now is the time to make\r\nhistorical decisions. Time is an elusive and perishable\r\ncommodity. We are all running out of it.\r\nWe are open to developing wide spaces of\r\ncooperation with our Palestinian neighbours and indeed\r\nwith all the countries of the Middle East, with dignity\r\nand mutuality. But, we do not intend to impose our\r\nexperience on anybody, nor is it our intention to assert\r\nour economic or technological presence amidst those of\r\nour neighbours who do not want it. The leaders and the\r\nelites throughout the Middle East do not need our\r\nadvice to know what are the real challenges ahead of us\r\nall: modernizing the economy and combating disease,\r\nhunger, poverty and illiteracy. Indeed, small islands of\r\nexcellence notwithstanding, the Middle East is in grave\r\ndanger of being on the wrong side of the digital divide.\r\nIn his inaugural speech in 1961, the late President\r\nKennedy invited his generation to join him in a\r\nstruggle:\r\n“Now the trumpet summons us again — not as a\r\ncall to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a\r\ncall to battle, though embattled we are — but a\r\ncall to bear the burden of a long twilight\r\nstruggle, ... a struggle against the common\r\nenemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and\r\nwar itself.”\r\nNothing will make us happier than joining hands\r\nwith our Arab neighbours with dignity and mutuality in\r\nthis most noble of struggles.\r\nThe Middle East is not tranquil yet. It is still\r\nreplete with armed conflicts, political hostilities and\r\nanimosities. Israel believes that regional arrangements\r\nare crucial for arms control. A step-by-step approach,\r\ncommensurate with progress towards comprehensive\r\npeace, is the right approach.\r\nWe are concerned by the expanding stockpiles of\r\nconventional weapons in the region, as well as by\r\nattempts made by Iran and Iraq to acquire and develop\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nnon-conventional weapons, and by an increasing\r\nmissile threat.\r\nIsrael attaches great importance to the eventual\r\nestablishment of a zone free of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction in the region. In order to reach that goal,\r\ndirect negotiations between all States of the region\r\nmust be held.\r\nLast year saw a turnaround in Israel’s relations\r\nwith the United Nations. After years of anomaly, Israel\r\nwas temporarily admitted to the Western European and\r\nOther Group (WEOG) in New York. We hope that\r\nIsrael’s admission to the Western Group in\r\ninternational organizations based outside New York\r\nwill soon be secured.\r\nThe United Nations, and indeed most of its\r\nMember States, played a major role in demanding that\r\nIran treat fairly the 13 Jews falsely accused, convicted\r\nand sentenced for ludicrous charges of espionage. It is\r\nin such instances that the international community has\r\nthe opportunity to express its discontent and exert\r\npressure on countries that break the norms of\r\nbehaviour.\r\nOn the issue of the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, is our opinion that the Security Council\r\nshould faithfully reflect the present geopolitical\r\npicture, a picture that has changed beyond recognition\r\nsince the last enlargement of the Council in 1965. We\r\nsubscribe to the view that the right of veto — a safety\r\nnet against the possible arbitrariness of the General\r\nAssembly — should remain in the hands of a limited\r\nnumber of States.\r\nAllow me a final reflection on the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian dilemma.\r\nThe tragedy of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\r\nstemmed from discrepant historical rhythms. The\r\nhistory of our modern national movement has been\r\ncharacterized by realistic responses to objective\r\nhistorical conditions. The Palestinians have\r\nconsistently fought for the solutions of yesterday —\r\nthose they had rejected a generation or two earlier. This\r\npersistent attempt to turn back the clock of history lies\r\nat the root of many of the misfortunes that have\r\nbefallen the peoples of the region. Now it is time for all\r\nof us to overcome dire memories and look forward.\r\nNeither the physical nor the rhetorical war of images\r\nwill bring us any closer to peace and reconciliation. No\r\none has a monopoly on the mythology of suffering and\r\natrocities. In this tragic dispute we have all committed\r\nacts of violence that we ought not to be proud of. To\r\nthe Palestinians we say, we are excited by the prospects\r\nto overcome the troubled history of our relations in\r\norder to shape our dreams of peace. Let us then join\r\nhands in asking the world, which has been watching,\r\nperplexed at, and sometimes even fuelling our wars, to\r\nmobilize its resources for the benefit of our peoples.\r\nAnd, let us be full partners in this international effort to\r\nlay down the foundations of the Middle East of the\r\nfuture. The creative energies of our peoples should at\r\nlong last be put to work in the service of peace, for as\r\nthe wisest of kings, King Solomon, the builder of the\r\nTemple in Jerusalem, wrote thousands of years ago,\r\nthere is:\r\n“A time for slaying and a time for healing ... a\r\ntime for war and a time for peace”. (The Holy\r\nBible, Ecclesiastes 3:3-8)\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Pakistan, His Excellency Mr. Abdul Sattar.\r\nMr. Sattar (Pakistan): Mr. President, it gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to join preceding speakers in offering\r\nyou the Pakistan delegation’s warm felicitations on\r\nyour election. We pledge to you our wholehearted\r\ncooperation in your efforts dedicated to the success of\r\nthis historic fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\nleadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nHis commitment and dynamism have reinforced the\r\nrightful role of the United Nations in addressing the\r\nchallenges of our times.\r\nThe millennial transition is unique in the lives of\r\nthose fortunate to witness it. We are fortunate, too, that\r\nwe start this session in the glow of the Millennium\r\nSummit. We shall be inspired in our work by the\r\nringing commitment of our leaders to values and\r\nprinciples fundamental to the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity; by the resolve of our leaders to free peoples\r\nfrom the scourge of war, on the one hand, and to free\r\nhumanity from dehumanizing poverty, on the other.\r\nTheir determination to protect the environment,\r\npromote human rights, democracy and good\r\ngovernance, and to meet the special needs of Africa,\r\nwill be our guide and mandate in our deliberations.\r\nIt will be our duty at this and future sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly, to translate the Millennium\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nDeclaration into action. This is no doubt a difficult\r\nchallenge. But it is a challenge we must meet. Only\r\nthus can we contribute to the building of a future better\r\nthan the past.\r\nTo all these ends — at once necessary as well as\r\nnoble — our leaders pledged to spare no efforts to\r\nmake the United Nations a more effective instrument of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nWhat is needed, if I may borrow an apt phrase\r\nfrom the Secretary General’s report, is a stronger\r\ncommitment to action — action to achieve peace, and\r\naction to achieve development.\r\nEach of our States can and must take action on\r\nboth fronts. But individual efforts cannot achieve\r\noptimum results. All of us need to work with\r\ndedication and a strong sense of commitment in a\r\ncooperative and harmonious environment to promote\r\nthe twin objectives for a better future.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration emphasizes the\r\ndetermination of world leaders to save peoples from\r\nthe scourge of war. Also the Secretary General’s report\r\nhighlights peace and security as:\r\n“a central objective of the United Nations at the\r\ndawn of the twenty-first century, as it was when\r\nthe Organization was founded over half a century\r\nago”. (A/55/1, para. 29)\r\nThe problem is how to prevent war and achieve\r\npeace. The solution is not difficult to find. What is\r\nneeded is a stronger commitment to action. Given that\r\ncommitment, crises and conflicts can be prevented and\r\npeace can be achieved. Peace not merely possible; it is\r\nrealizable through a civilized approach to conflict\r\nresolution based on justice and international law and\r\nthe principles of the Charter, the United Nations can\r\nensure effective remedial action to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nPeople watched with relief as the world\r\ncommunity joined together to prevent genocide in\r\nBosnia and Kosovo. With the commendable\r\ncooperation of the Government of Indonesia and the\r\nimaginative contribution of the Secretary-General, we\r\napproached the situation in East Timor in a similar\r\nway. The imaginative and diligent efforts of the\r\nPersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Ambassador\r\nJamsheed Marker, to promote the settlement in East\r\nTimor are a matter of pride for the people of Pakistan.\r\nThese are all examples of how the United Nations and\r\nthe international community can and should act to\r\naddress conflicts by implementing its principles and\r\ndecisions.\r\nIn the Middle East, too, the peace process has\r\nmade steady, if agonizingly slow, progress. For the\r\ngains so far made, tribute is due to the idealistic efforts\r\nof the peacemakers and the realistic approach of the\r\nPalestinian and Israeli leaders. The residual issues are\r\ndifficult and delicate, involving as they do principles of\r\nlaw and equity on the one hand, and deep emotions on\r\nthe other. Yet we ardently hope that the peace process\r\nwill succeed soon. Final settlement of the Palestinian\r\nquestion will be a crowning achievement and a\r\nmomentous contribution to peace in the Middle East.\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973) and 425 (1977) are imbued with an\r\nirreplaceable international sanctity. Their\r\nimplementation involves the prestige and credibility of\r\nthe United Nations. An end to occupation and the\r\nreversion of holy Jerusalem to Palestinian sovereignty\r\nwill ensure reconciliation and durable peace in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nThe Kashmir question, involving the life and\r\nfuture of the people of the State, has been the root\r\ncause of tensions in South Asia since 1947. Its\r\nsettlement is an indispensable condition for peace and\r\nstability. The ten million people of that State will not\r\nbe denied their right to freedom. They seek nothing\r\nmore than the fulfilment of the commitments contained\r\nin the resolutions of the Security Council. Their right\r\nto decide their own future cannot lapse. The passage of\r\n53 years has only compounded the tragedy of the\r\nKashmiri people and prolonged their travail. The long\r\ndelay has only heightened the terrible dangers inherent\r\nin the festering dispute.\r\nAccording to the All Parties Freedom\r\nConference, 72,000 Kashmiris have been killed since\r\n1989. Thousands more have been tortured and maimed\r\nor have disappeared. The massive human rights\r\nviolations in Kashmir, and the repression and brutality\r\nperpetrated on the Kashmiri people by occupation\r\nforces, are a grave crime of State terrorism.\r\nIn a desperate attempt to undermine and suppress\r\nthe Kashmiri Freedom Movement, the perpetrators of\r\nrepression and violence against the Kashmiri people\r\nhave tried to portray the freedom struggle as terrorism.\r\nSuch propaganda did not carry credibility in the past\r\nand it cannot do so now. It is familiar to all those who\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nhave won freedom after protracted struggles against\r\ncolonialism and foreign occupation.\r\nPakistan has consistently vowed to seek a\r\npeaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute. Two years\r\nago, the Security Council once again emphasized the\r\nneed to resolve the dispute, which has been the source\r\nof tension and conflict in the region. The provisions of\r\nArticle 33 of the Charter place an obligation on\r\nMember States to settle disputes through recourse to\r\nnegotiation, inquiry, conciliation, mediation, arbitration\r\nor adjudication. Each and every one of these means is\r\nacceptable to Pakistan. Faced with the intransigent\r\nrejection of peaceful means, the Security Council has a\r\nresponsibility to act. The Charter empowers the\r\nSecurity Council to do so. What is needed is a stronger\r\ncommitment to action. In its absence, mere talk of\r\ncrisis prevention and dispute resolution will lack\r\ncredibility.\r\nAfghanistan remains trapped in a terrible tragedy.\r\nIts protracted war of liberation in the 1980s left it\r\ndevastated. The internecine war in the 1990s has\r\ninflicted further ravages. The economy of the country\r\nis in shambles. Drought in southern Afghanistan this\r\npast year has added to the misery of the people of this\r\nancient land.\r\nTied to the Afghan people by bonds of geography,\r\nhistory and culture, the people of Pakistan view the\r\ntragedy in Afghanistan with a deep sense of sympathy.\r\nDespite economic stringency, we continue to provide\r\nshelter to 1.5 million Afghan refugees. The interruption\r\nof the food supply from, or via, Pakistan would further\r\naggravate hardship and trigger a fresh influx. That is\r\nwhy Pakistan is opposed to sanctions that hurt people.\r\nNo people except the Afghan people themselves\r\nhave suffered more from the conflict and instability in\r\nAfghanistan than the people of Pakistan. It is natural\r\ntherefore that Pakistan should support all efforts for\r\npeace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. We were\r\nencouraged to note a similarity of approaches by the\r\nForeign Ministers of the six contiguous countries, the\r\nRussian Federation and the United States at the “Six-\r\nplus-Two” group meeting convened on 15 September\r\nby the Secretary-General. Pooling our resources and\r\ninfluence, we should make more energetic efforts to\r\npersuade the Afghan parties and assist the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations in his efforts to promote\r\na broad-based Government acceptable to the Afghan\r\npolitical parties and ethnic groups.\r\nWe support the Islamic Republic of Iran as it\r\nleads a parallel effort for peace in Afghanistan on\r\nbehalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\n(OIC). We also appreciate the efforts recently\r\nundertaken by Turkmenistan. In our view, all these\r\nefforts complement and reinforce each other.\r\nIn his report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/55/1), the Secretary-General referred to the influx\r\nof war materiel to Afghanistan from outside. Pakistan\r\nurges not only a ceasefire but also a ban on the supply\r\nof military equipment to the Afghan parties and the\r\nestablishment of a monitoring mechanism for its\r\nenforcement. We also remain cognizant of the\r\nimperative of respect for sovereignty. The Afghan\r\npeople have a history of fierce resistance against\r\noutside interference. Engagement with the Afghan\r\nGovernment offers better hope for amelioration than\r\nattempts to drive it into a corner and isolate it. The\r\nUnited Nations has been providing humanitarian relief\r\nin Afghanistan. Programmes aimed at rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction may help bring the country back\r\ninto the international mainstream sooner. That is also\r\nthe more compassionate way.\r\nPakistan, itself a victim of terrorism, condemns\r\nthat evil in all its forms and manifestations, whether\r\ncommitted by individuals, groups or States. Our\r\nGovernment has ratified nine international conventions\r\nagainst terrorism and we join all international efforts to\r\ncombat this menace.\r\nPakistan has historically supported all proposals\r\nand agreements aimed at the limitation, progressive\r\nreduction and eventual elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. For over a quarter of a century we made\r\nefforts and initiated proposals to keep our area free of\r\nnuclear weapons. Also, Pakistan has been prepared to\r\nsupport universal and non-discriminatory measures and\r\nproposals. Pakistan voted in favour of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 and\r\nintended to sign it along with all others, especially the\r\ndesignated States. The process of bringing that Treaty\r\ninto force was derailed due to events not of our own\r\nmaking. Even then, Pakistan was not the first to\r\nconduct tests in 1998. Pakistan will not be the first to\r\nresume them. We still hope the Treaty can be brought\r\ninto force. Pakistan will not obstruct the realization of\r\nthat aim. Our Government continues efforts to build\r\ndomestic consensus in favour of signing the Treaty.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nMeanwhile, restraint and responsibility remain\r\nthe guiding principles of our nuclear policy. Pakistan\r\nwill not enter into any nuclear arms race. Our sole aim\r\nis to retain minimum credible deterrence. I wish to\r\nreaffirm in this Assembly that our nuclear capability is\r\nonly meant to deter aggression against Pakistan; it\r\nposes no threat to any country.\r\nWe support efforts aimed at the prevention of the\r\nvertical or horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\nDuring the past year we have further strengthened\r\ndomestic regulations against export of nuclear\r\nequipment or materials. Our power reactors are under\r\ninternational safeguards.\r\nPakistan is prepared to cooperate in efforts to\r\nintroduce restraints on the development, production\r\nand deployment of ballistic missiles. To be successful,\r\nhowever, such efforts must be non-discriminatory.\r\nTheir aim must be stabilization of the situation.\r\nAny use of nuclear weapons is inconceivable.\r\nHowever, the Charter obliges Members to refrain from\r\nthe threat or the use of any force. The world\r\ncommunity should, therefore, emphasize no-first-use of\r\nforce, nuclear or conventional.\r\nAt the global level, Pakistan supports calls for the\r\ncontinued observance of the Anti-Ballistic Missile\r\nTreaty. The militarization of outer space would be a\r\ndisservice to hopes for the maintenance of existing\r\nrestraint and stability.\r\nPakistan will participate in negotiations on the\r\nproposed fissile material cut-off treaty and make a\r\npositive contribution to evolving a fair and an equitable\r\ntext that all countries can support.\r\nIn his address to the Millennium Summit, the\r\nChief Executive of Pakistan, General Pervez\r\nMusharraf, stated:\r\n“The best assurance for the consolidation of\r\nglobal peace lies in the economic development\r\nand prosperity of all regions and all peoples.\r\nEconomic progress in one region supports and\r\ncomplements prosperity in the other.” (A/55/PV.4)\r\nDevelopment is not a zero-sum game.\r\nAccordingly, the Millennium Declaration commits\r\nworld leaders to\r\n“making the right to development a reality for\r\neveryone” (resolution 55/2, para. 11) and freeing\r\nthe entire human race from want.\r\nGlobalization raised hopes, as it offered\r\nopportunities for faster economic growth, higher living\r\nstandards and accelerated benefits from the flow of\r\nknowledge and technology. But there have been\r\ndisappointments. Experience has shown that the\r\nbenefits of globalization have been uneven and that the\r\nnumber of people living in poverty has actually\r\nincreased. Technological and information revolutions\r\nhave accentuated global inequality, and a new digital\r\ndivide has led to the marginalization of a large number\r\nof developing countries.\r\nGlobal trade regimes benefit the rich, and the\r\nSouth has become poorer. Competition, standards, a\r\nvariety of non-tariff barriers, increasingly complex\r\ntrading practices, protectionism in selected sectors such\r\nas agriculture, and restrictions on technology transfers\r\nall militate against the interests of the developing\r\ncountries. They find it hard to secure adequate returns\r\nfor their products or to attract investment to improve\r\ntheir competitiveness. As a result, economic disparities\r\nare widening. This belies the promise of free markets\r\nto ensure the well-being of all.\r\nThe failure of the World Trade Organization\r\nmeeting in Seattle last November and dissenting voices\r\nheard in Washington last April make it clear that the\r\ninternational economic system needs to be fixed.\r\nConcerted global action is required for sustained\r\ndevelopment to benefit and protect weaker economies.\r\nThe industrialized countries have a special\r\nresponsibility to adopt bold initiatives. Professions of a\r\ndesire for the eradication of poverty must first lead to\r\nthe establishment of an international economic policy\r\nframework responsive to the needs of the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nOne important area is the debt issue. In one of the\r\ninteractive dialogues the Secretary-General proposed\r\nthat the United Nations could mediate between\r\ncreditors and debtors to address the debt problem. We\r\nwelcome this proposal. Our Chief Executive, speaking\r\nat the same meeting, suggested that developing\r\nindebted countries should be allowed to utilize\r\nresources allocated to debt servicing for the\r\ndevelopment of the social sector, especially education\r\nand health care. Substantive debt relief through\r\ninnovative approaches will go a long way to help\r\ndeveloping countries ensure global harmony and\r\nregenerate a new economic partnership between the\r\nNorth and the South.\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nA holistic approach to deal with problems of\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication is necessary.\r\nWhile we welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative to\r\nbridge the digital divide, the emphasis must remain on\r\naddressing mass literacy, capacity-building,\r\ninfrastructure and basic health facilities. Similarly,\r\nmultilateral trade regimes should be development-\r\noriented. Environmental concerns about the prudent\r\nuse of natural resources must be pursued\r\nsimultaneously with emphasis on sustained economic\r\ngrowth in the South.\r\nThe High-level International Intergovernmental\r\nEvent on Financing for Development, which will be\r\nheld next year, must involve the world’s finance, trade\r\nand development organizations in discussing the issues\r\ncomprehensively. The conference should promote good\r\ngovernance at the international level. It must address\r\nhow we can manage globalization appropriately so that\r\nits benefits reach everyone, ensuring universal\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe upsurge of democracy in the past decade has\r\nbeen a good omen for the start of the new millennium.\r\nThis salutary trend can only be sustained through\r\nequitable economic development. Unless the\r\ndeveloping nations are able to have a fair share in\r\nrising levels of global prosperity, the advocacy of\r\ndemocratic values and human and social standards will\r\nremain hollow.\r\nIn Pakistan we are addressing the challenges of\r\nboth economic revival and institutional reforms that\r\nemphasize accountability, good governance and the\r\ndevolution of power to grass-roots levels political\r\ninstitutions. In this endeavour, the Government is\r\nbanking on the support and enthusiasm of our people.\r\nWe believe that democracy is, first and foremost,\r\nempowerment of the people, based on strong\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe world community is well aware of the\r\nravages inflicted on fragile economies of developing\r\ncountries and their poor people as a result of corruption\r\nand the transfer of illegal funds to safe havens abroad.\r\nThey are often the worst victims of such malpractice\r\ndue to socio-economic forces within and banking\r\npractices outside their countries.\r\nThe welfare of humanity in developing countries\r\ndemands international cooperation for the prevention\r\nof corruption. Such cooperation was urged in\r\nresolutions 53/176 of 15 December 1998 and 54/205 of\r\n22 December 1999. The South Summit, held in Havana\r\nin April 2000, also requested remedial action.\r\nTransfers of illicit funds from developing\r\ncountries will not make the rich countries much richer,\r\nbut they will make the poor countries poorer. It is a\r\nparadox that some rich countries have such lax laws\r\nthat they provide safe havens and encourage private\r\nbanks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt persons\r\nfrom poor countries by facilitating the establishment of\r\nsecret accounts. That is tantamount to the\r\nencouragement of plunder, indeed, of financial\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe nexus between corruption and the failure of\r\ndemocracy was recognized also in the Final\r\nDeclaration issued by the meeting of the Community of\r\nDemocracies in Warsaw, held from 25 to 27 June 2000.\r\nIt emphasized the need to combat corruption, which\r\ncorrodes democracy. We need, therefore, to take\r\neffective action. We propose that the General Assembly\r\nshould proclaim a policy of zero tolerance of all types\r\nof corruption and urge a ban on the laundering of illicit\r\nfunds.\r\nThe United Nations has emerged as the only\r\nforum with the universal recognition and authority to\r\naddress the entire spectrum of issues relating to human\r\naspirations for peace, justice and development. To meet\r\nthese growing expectations, this world body must be\r\nstrengthened. Its role must be reinforced in order to\r\nensure a better future for the world.\r\nWe support the call for enhancing the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations in the areas of conflict prevention\r\nand peacekeeping. In this regard, we commend\r\nMr. Brahimi and members of the high-level Panel for\r\ntheir extensive report. As an important participant in\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, we in\r\nPakistan look forward to discussions on the useful\r\nideas and concepts that have been presented in the\r\nreport to enable the United Nations to respond more\r\neffectively to existing and incipient conflicts and\r\nthreats to international peace and security.\r\nNo other aspect of reform of the United Nations\r\nmerits as close attention as the need to make the\r\nSecurity Council more democratic, transparent and\r\naccountable. Periodic elections of a larger number of\r\nmembers will make the Security Council not only more\r\nrepresentative but also more responsive to the\r\naspirations of the world community. That will enhance\r\nthe capacity of this vital organ to contribute to the\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to\r\nthe realization of the purposes of the Organization.\r\nThat objective will not be achieved by the creation of\r\nnew centres of privilege which detract from the\r\ncardinal principle of the sovereign equality of States.\r\nFor the same reason, the decision-making process\r\nneeds to be made more democratic.\r\nFor the Security Council to command universal\r\nrespect, its reform should have the general agreement\r\nof the membership. Nothing should be done in haste or\r\nin a manner that divides the membership or impairs the\r\nauthority and prestige of the Council.\r\nIn this increasingly interactive world, we share\r\nwith other nations the desire for a peaceful\r\nenvironment and mutually beneficial cooperation, and\r\nwe see a pivotal role for the United Nations. The\r\nuniversality of the United Nations gives it a stature and\r\nlegitimacy that is unprecedented in history. The\r\nOrganization should begin the twenty-first century by\r\ndemonstrating a clear commitment to addressing and\r\nresolving the key development and security challenges\r\nfacing our peoples. It must be enabled to apply its\r\nimmutable principles and its decisions consistently and\r\nforcefully to ensure durable peace, sustained economic\r\nprogress and a better future for all humanity.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. James Victor Gbeho, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Ghana.\r\nMr. Gbeho (Ghana): On behalf of my delegation,\r\nSir, I wish to congratulate you sincerely on your\r\nelection as President of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This session is indeed historic,\r\ncoming as it does in the wake of a Millennium Summit\r\nthat witnessed the presence of the largest-ever\r\ngathering of political leaders of the international\r\ncommunity. I also wish to commend the other members\r\nof the Bureau on their election.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay a richly\r\ndeserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia, whose deep\r\nsense of duty and commitment to social justice helped\r\nshape the United Nations agenda for the new century.\r\nIndeed, the General Assembly gave impetus to such an\r\nagenda when, in December 1998, it decided to hold the\r\nMillennium events, believing strongly that the turn of\r\nthe century was a unique and symbolically compelling\r\nmoment to articulate and affirm an animating vision for\r\nthe United Nations in the new era.\r\nBarely a fortnight ago, world leaders met here in\r\nNew York, following that commitment, to address the\r\nchallenges of the new century, reaffirm their\r\ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nto demonstrate political will for the new process. The\r\nmessage that emerged from the statements made by the\r\nheads of State or Government at the Millennium\r\nSummit was the reaffirmation of the unique role of the\r\nUnited Nations in offering the best, and only, universal\r\nframework for confronting the challenges of the\r\nmillennium.\r\nIt recognized a United Nations capable of\r\npromoting a new development agenda that is people-\r\noriented and which also guarantees greater\r\nparticipation of stakeholders, particularly women, the\r\nyouth, the private sector and civil society at large; a\r\nUnited Nations that has been revitalized to play a more\r\nmeaningful role in helping developing countries meet\r\nthe challenges of poverty reduction, political pluralism\r\nand the ongoing process of globalization; a United\r\nNations that boldly plays its role as an Organization\r\nworking for the good of all, with the confidence of the\r\nworld’s people.\r\nThe conjunction of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the beginning of a new\r\nmillennium provides a symbolic departure point for the\r\ninternational community to seek to do better in all\r\nareas of its endeavour. Today, there is no greater\r\nchallenge facing our world and no greater issue\r\ndefining this millennium than the debilitating\r\ninhumanity of poverty, its heavy hand on wealth\r\ncreation, its fast spread across the world, the deadly\r\neffect of economic insecurity on peace and security and\r\nits impact on the environment. It is thus perplexing that\r\nunder the effect of globalization, deprivation and\r\ninequality are accelerating globally with as much speed\r\nas innovation, technological progress and integration,\r\nalthough in different directions. Our collective\r\ningenuity, that of both developed and developing, is\r\ncalled upon to produce answers that will bring us\r\ncloser than ever before to the purposes of the Charter.\r\nWe have encountered disappointments as the\r\ninternational community has striven for peace, security,\r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. We have\r\nalso sought ways of dealing with the impact of\r\nglobalization on international trade and investment. We\r\nshould not resign ourselves to these reversals, nor\r\nshould we accept living with them. To do so would\r\ndefeat the objective of development. The way forward\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nis not only to revitalize the United Nations to enable it\r\nto strive more boldly for a more equitable global\r\nsociety, but also to work together to ensure that equity,\r\nfairness and solidarity characterize international\r\nrelations.\r\nOn the important question of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, the role of the United\r\nNations has been, without doubt, that of facilitating\r\nconditions under which countries and peoples may live\r\ntogether securely and harmoniously in order to give\r\nfree rein to their creative talents. One important means\r\nof achieving this objective in the midst of violent\r\nconflicts that keep erupting has been to undertake\r\npeacekeeping all over the world. Ghana has been and\r\nwill continue to be a major contributor to this effort, as\r\nconflicts in Africa especially pose a major challenge to\r\nthe United Nations efforts to bring about global peace\r\nand prosperity.\r\nThe situations in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Sierra Leone, to name only two examples,\r\namply demonstrate the complexities of the challenges\r\nwhich the United Nations must show it can handle. In\r\nthe West African subregion, for example, we must all\r\ncooperate in imposing a ban on the purchase of small\r\narms and especially on the purchase of diamonds that\r\nare not controlled by the Certificate of Origin regime\r\nfrom countries in conflict. Unless the international\r\ncommunity helps by implementing this aspect of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, international peace and\r\nsecurity will continue to be prejudiced by the greed and\r\nambition of individuals.\r\nEnhancing Africa’s peacekeeping capacity to\r\ncope with challenging missions, through training,\r\nlogistics and financial support, as well as a stronger\r\npartnership between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, is a\r\ncrucial goal if we are to return the continent to peace\r\nand security. That is one of the reasons why Ghana\r\nattaches importance to regional and subregional\r\npeacekeeping initiatives. However, such initiatives\r\nshould not become an excuse for the United Nations or\r\nthe Security Council to shirk their primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity in Africa.\r\nDisarmament lies at the heart of the United\r\nNations efforts to ensure and sustain international\r\npeace and security, conditions necessary for all\r\nproductive human activity. The nuclear threat of the\r\ncold-war era still looms large over all of us and will\r\ncontinue to do so until the nuclear Powers and\r\nmilitarily significant countries disarm. It is therefore\r\nreassuring that, despite the gloom that has beclouded\r\nthe United Nations disarmament machinery over past\r\nyears, positive results were achieved at the Sixth\r\nReview Conference of the State Parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nThe United Nations must capitalize on this\r\nmomentum and continue its search for new ways and\r\nmeans to achieve nuclear disarmament and arms non-\r\nproliferation. It must also embark on confidence-\r\nbuilding measures in order to enhance the process. In\r\nthis regard, the Disarmament Commission and other\r\nrelevant machinery on disarmament established by the\r\nGeneral Assembly should be given every opportunity\r\nto fulfil their mandates through the demonstration by\r\nMember States of commitment, flexibility and the\r\nnecessary political will.\r\nGhana would therefore use this opportunity to\r\nreiterate its support for the proposal by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of convening a major international conference\r\non the nuclear threat. We will also play an active part\r\nin the preparatory process leading to the United\r\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\r\nand Light Weapons in All its Aspects, to be held in\r\n2001.\r\nGhana believes that the efforts of the United\r\nNations to promote and maintain international peace\r\nand security should rest on a firm international legal\r\nframework, hence the need to maintain support for the\r\nuseful work being done by the International Law\r\nCommission and related institutions in the United\r\nNations system. We believe that the tremendous\r\nprogress made in the establishment of legal\r\nframeworks for the pursuit of crimes against humanity,\r\nfor example, must continue if our societies are to be\r\nmaintained.\r\nIn the particular case of Africa, support for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is not only desirable; it is\r\na must, since censure by the international community is\r\nnow very necessary in dissuading warlords and rebels\r\nfrom committing the heinous crimes that we continue\r\nto witness in countries such as Sierra Leone, Rwanda\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ghana\r\nrecommends, therefore, that international law should\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nensure that the perpetrators of such crimes are punished\r\nand that they do not enjoy amnesty from any country.\r\nThe spirit of compromise which led to the\r\noverwhelming endorsement of the Rome Treaty\r\nestablishing the International Criminal Court, must be\r\nkept alive to achieve our objectives in this field.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to\r\nengage the serious attention of us all. Ghana\r\nacknowledges the current propitious climate in the\r\nMiddle East as a result of the revival of contacts\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the\r\nhighest levels. The withdrawal of Israeli Defence\r\nForces from Southern Lebanon has given these talks a\r\nsense of optimism, and so have the meetings between\r\nChairman Arafat and Mr. Ehud Barak. While we\r\ncommend President Clinton’s efforts, the two leaders of\r\nthe Middle East are urged to show flexibility and stay\r\nthe course, as the obstacles to peace cannot be removed\r\nwithout compromise, painful sacrifices, diplomacy and\r\na strong desire for durable peace. Both sides should\r\nremember that this is perhaps the finest hour for\r\nreaching agreement. The negative forces in Israel,\r\nespecially, are regrouping, while the younger\r\ngeneration in Palestine are growing more and more\r\nimpatient. No sacrifice should therefore be too great\r\nfor success.\r\nMs. Brizuela de Ávila (El Salvador), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nIn this new era we must have the boldness to end\r\nattitudes and situations that are no longer helpful to the\r\nprocess of globalization. In spite of the regular\r\nacknowledgement by world leaders and other\r\ninfluential policy makers of the need for poverty\r\nalleviation, those in a position to do so have failed to\r\noffer credible arrangements for debt relief, market\r\naccess and financing for development which would go\r\na long way in enabling developing countries to build\r\nviable socio-economic systems capable of overcoming\r\nthe fragmentation and marginalization being suffered\r\nas a result of globalization. On the contrary, they are\r\nusing their pre-eminent political and economic\r\npositions to try to control and manipulate developing\r\ncountries, especially countries whose Governments\r\nthey do not support.\r\nIt seems to me that the world community is yet to\r\ntranslate the traditional parochial affirmation of the\r\nneed for equity, fairness and solidarity for national\r\ndevelopment into concrete international actions.\r\nFurthermore, the United Nations will be able to teach\r\nlessons of equality and justice to its members only\r\nwhen it practises those norms itself.\r\nAt the end of the cold war the peoples of the\r\nworld heard a lot about the peace dividend. Only a\r\ndecade after this new concept was trumpeted from the\r\nrooftops, it has turned out to be non-existent. But that\r\nconcept can be real if the tenor of our negotiations\r\nreflects an awareness of our common humanity and its\r\nhighest values rather than the diplomatic stock-in-trade\r\nof an era shaped by competitive warfare and an\r\nunequal advantage of the rich and powerful over the\r\npoor and militarily insignificant countries.\r\nInternational cooperation for development must replace\r\ninequity and war.\r\nTransforming the context of international\r\ncooperation for development depends as much on the\r\nlevel of commitment of individuals and groups in our\r\nrespective countries as it does on what we do as\r\npolitical leaders and policy makers. In this connection,\r\nreinforcing and enhancing the network of linkages\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society is a\r\nfundamental necessity. Unless our actions reflect this\r\nstrategic understanding of the nature of decision-\r\nmaking in the world today, we are unlikely to benefit\r\nfrom the mistakes of our past efforts.\r\nWe accordingly urge the Secretary-General to\r\nexamine ways of ensuring common, acceptable\r\nstandards for accountability and transparency, even in\r\nthe operations of non-governmental organizations with\r\nrespect to their participation in the United Nations. In\r\naddition, a greater effort should be made to build the\r\ncapacity of non-governmental organizations in\r\ndeveloping countries so that non-governmental\r\norganization participation in the United Nations could\r\nreflect the diversity of interests across the world.\r\nGhana welcomes the contribution of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to the work of the United\r\nNations and individual countries, but must at the same\r\ntime caution against replacing the genuine and\r\ndemocratic voice of a people with those of externally\r\ncontrolled non-governmental organizations and the\r\nprivate sector. Non-governmental organizations and the\r\nprivate sector are vital agents of change in developing\r\ncountries, but they should not replace the voice of a\r\npeople, if democracy is to retain credibility.\r\nIn an age of globalization and of our increasingly\r\nknowledge-based society, we feel that the United\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nNations has a major responsibility to support the\r\ndevelopment efforts of the developing countries, and\r\nthat the international community should provide the\r\nnecessary resources for it to do so. We therefore call\r\nonce again on all Member States to fulfil their financial\r\nobligations under the Charter in full and on time.\r\nThe challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity, such as the growing income and\r\ntechnology gaps between the North and the South,\r\npoverty and deprivation, point to the need for stronger\r\ncooperation between the developed and developing\r\ncountries. A concerted effort will be required to\r\npromote a systematic dialogue between the two groups\r\nto find solutions to these problems.\r\nIt must be the vocation — indeed, the\r\ncommitment — of the North-South partnership to\r\nensure that in the new millennium governance,\r\nnationally and globally, rests on the recognition that the\r\nwealth of some must not lead to the impoverishment of\r\nothers, and that every person on this earth must have\r\naccess to certain basic social services, such as health\r\ncare, education, food and safe water, no matter which\r\ncorner of the earth he or she inhabits. Thus the rich\r\ncountries have an indispensable role to play by further\r\nopening their markets, by providing larger and faster\r\ndebt relief and by giving more and better focused\r\ndevelopment assistance, which would enable poorer\r\ncountries to sustain a meaningful level of development.\r\nIt is only fitting that as a developing economy,\r\nGhana identifies itself with the cause of the least\r\ndeveloped countries, most of which are in Africa. In\r\nthis connection, we fully subscribe to the preparatory\r\nwork for the Third United Nations Conference on the\r\nLeast Developed Countries. We expect consensus to be\r\nreached on the accessibility of products of least\r\ndeveloped countries to the developed markets.\r\nOur comments on this occasion would be\r\nincomplete without touching upon the crucial question\r\nof the empowerment of women and the attainment of\r\ngender balance. We also wish to express concern about\r\nthe persistence of discrimination against women in\r\nmost parts of the world in spite of the progress\r\nachieved since the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, held in 1995. The challenges to the\r\nachievement of gender balance can be eliminated\r\nthrough a renewed commitment to the implementation\r\nof the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women. We therefore call on all\r\ncountries which have not yet ratified the Convention to\r\ntake steps to do so, and urge prompt implementation of\r\nthe provisions of the Convention. We also urge those\r\nwho have entered reservations incompatible with the\r\npurpose of the Convention to reconsider their stance, in\r\nthe interest of advancing the cause of women.\r\nThe promotion and protection of the rights of\r\nchildren are of equal concern to my delegation. They\r\nare the compelling reasons for our co-hosting jointly\r\nwith the Government of Canada a workshop on\r\nchildren in armed conflicts. It is our expectation that\r\nMember States will endeavour to ratify the Optional\r\nProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\nbefore the General Assembly’s special session in 2001\r\nthat will review the implementation of the World\r\nDeclaration on the Survival, Protection and\r\nDevelopment of Children and of the Plan of Action. It\r\nis also our hope that the positive outcome of the just\r\nended International Conference on War-affected\r\nChildren, held in Winnipeg, Canada, will be fully\r\nimplemented to ensure the worldwide protection of\r\nchildren during conflicts.\r\nI now turn to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, whose\r\nimpact has been greatest in sub-Saharan Africa, where\r\nit is estimated to have affected the modest gains in\r\nsocial development. Statistics released during the XIII\r\nInternational AIDS Conference in South Africa in July\r\nthis year showed that almost a third of all people with\r\nHIV/AIDS are between the ages of 15 and 24 years.\r\nEvery minute six people under the age of 25 catch HIV,\r\nwith girls more than 50 per cent more likely to contract\r\nthe virus than boys. Based on this data, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has emphasized\r\nthat to defeat the disease, Governments must commit\r\nthemselves to “the largest mobilization of resources in\r\ntheir history” and organize themselves as if they were\r\nfighting “a full-blown war of liberation”, with young\r\npeople in the forefront.\r\nThis staggering situation must prick the\r\nconscience of the entire international community into\r\nrendering full support for efforts to control and\r\nminimize the spread of the disease. Ghana supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal for the adoption of 2005\r\nand 2010 respectively as deadlines by which to reduce\r\nthe rate of infection of young persons through the\r\nassurance by the developed partners and their\r\npharmaceutical industries of the easy availability of\r\ninexpensive vaccines. To reach that goal, we must also\r\ninvest in education, publicity, open discussions and\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nmoral counselling of our youth, in particular. They\r\nmust understand that it is indeed possible to avoid the\r\ndisease by exercising care, since this fatal disease is\r\ntransmitted in a very limited number of ways. We\r\nappeal to our developed partners for their full\r\ncooperation.\r\nFinally, there is no doubt that the United Nations\r\nremains the only instrument for confronting the\r\nchallenges of this millennium. However, it can\r\nsurmount these challenges only by sustaining the good\r\nwill and credibility it enjoys among Member States and\r\nthis can be achieved only by expediting the\r\ndemocratization of the Organization. May the new\r\nvision which our leaders have charted for the\r\nOrganization in this new century spur us all to concrete\r\naction to free our peoples, whose faith and trust reside\r\nin us, from fear, want and exclusion.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Aleksandar\r\nDimitrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nMr. Dimitrov (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): At the outset, I would like to congratulate\r\nMr. Holkeri on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. At the same time, I\r\nwould like to express our appreciation to the President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the results achieved during\r\nhis presidency.\r\nOn this occasion, I would also like to express our\r\ngratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\nefficient and relevant leadership of the Organization.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia will continue actively to\r\ncontribute to the realization of the goals of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI also welcome the admission of Tuvalu to the\r\nUnited Nations, wishing it success in its contribution to\r\nUnited Nations activities and expressing our wish to\r\nestablish diplomatic relations. At the same time, the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia expresses its readiness and\r\ncalls for the acceleration of the process of establishing\r\ndiplomatic relations with all other States Members of\r\nthe United Nations with which we have not yet done\r\nso.\r\nIn the region where the Republic of Macedonia is\r\nlocated, the situation has to some extent improved after\r\nthe huge humanitarian crisis that took place in Kosovo.\r\nThe heavy consequences of the crisis, which posed a\r\nserious threat to the stability and security of the\r\nBalkans and more widely in Europe, have not been\r\nfully overcome.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia has and will have in\r\nthe future a vital role to play for peace and stability in\r\nSouth-East Europe and beyond. The risks confronting\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia were enormous. The\r\nMacedonian Government and our citizens have done\r\neverything within their capacity to respond to the\r\nproblems. However, as was the case in the previous\r\ncrises that occurred in the Balkans and during the\r\nKosovo conflict last year as well, as one of the\r\ncountries that most directly felt and bore the brunt of\r\nthe damage, the Republic of Macedonia has shown and\r\nconfirmed its long-term commitment to acting as a\r\nfactor for peace and stability in the region. The\r\nGovernment, even in such conditions, persisted in its\r\npolicy to preserve the stability of the Macedonian State\r\nand at the same time to reaffirm its capability to\r\nrespond to all challenges and risks confronting it, in\r\nparticular in the economic and social fields.\r\nOne of the main priorities of the foreign policy of\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia is to further improve good-\r\nneighbourly relations with all its neighbours. This\r\ncommitment has been confirmed through a number of\r\nour initiatives, resulting in more advanced and\r\ndeveloped relations in bilateral cooperation and\r\nintensified cooperation within the framework of a\r\nnumber of regional initiatives. My country is aware\r\nthat stability and prosperity, in the medium and long\r\nterms, can be ensured only if stability is spread\r\nthroughout South-East Europe, with intensive mutual\r\ncommunications and good-neighbourly cooperation\r\namong all States of the region.\r\nMy country has managed, with almost all its\r\nneighbours — Greece, Albania and Bulgaria, but not\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with which we\r\ncontinue to negotiate the demarcation of our common\r\nborder — to have outstanding relations and to develop\r\ncooperation in many areas of common interest. We\r\nhave significantly improved relations with our southern\r\nneighbour, Greece. We continue to hold talks on our\r\ndifferences over the name of my country, under the\r\nauspices of the Secretary-General, expressing our will\r\nand interest in resolving this issue as soon as possible,\r\ntaking into account the reality and dignity of the\r\ncountry and all its citizens.\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nDespite the huge expectations and initial support,\r\nthe project that is most expected to contribute to the\r\nlasting stabilization of the region — the Stability\r\nPact — has not managed to ensure the implementation\r\nof a large number of ideas and plans that have been\r\nsubmitted and accepted. The Pact, a significant\r\nexample of the joint engagement and functioning of a\r\nlarge number of international organizations and States,\r\nis intended to hasten the revitalization of the countries\r\nof South-East Europe and their integration into\r\nEuropean structures. I appeal to all participants\r\nengaged in this process, especially the donors and the\r\nwider international community, to make the utmost\r\nefforts to speed its urgent and timely implementation\r\nthrough the accelerated and full realization of these\r\nprojects. This will provide for the economic prosperity\r\nof the countries of South-East Europe and strengthen\r\ndemocratic processes, respect for human rights and\r\nstability in the region. The implementation of the Pact\r\nconstitutes a natural upgrading of our activities within\r\nthe context of regional initiatives to promote good-\r\nneighbourly relations and the possibility of the\r\nrealization of the foreign policy priorities of my\r\ncountry: its full integration into the European and\r\nEuro-Atlantic structures.\r\nIn addition to its foreign policy activities, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia is fully\r\ncommitted to carrying out fundamental reforms based\r\non European standards — political, economic and\r\ndemocratic — with maximum respect for human rights,\r\nincluding minority rights. The Government of my\r\ncountry is continuously working on the improvement\r\nof inter-ethnic relations. A law on higher education\r\nwas recently adopted that paves the way for private\r\nhigher education in minority languages. Therefore, as a\r\nresult of our commitment, concrete steps and\r\nachievements, by the end of this year my country will\r\nbe the first in the region to conclude the Stabilization\r\nand Association Agreement with the European Union.\r\nThe efforts of the international community to\r\nstabilize the region, to which the Republic of\r\nMacedonia has contributed widely, are beginning to\r\nshow results. Despite the limitations, it should be taken\r\ninto consideration that the seriousness and complexity\r\nof the situation in Kosovo, and in the Federal Republic\r\nof Yugoslavia as a whole, mean that the consequences\r\nof this situation cannot be alleviated with the speed\r\ndesired by all of us, especially by the countries of the\r\nregion.\r\nIn regard to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\r\nour view is that its democratization is one of the key\r\nfactors for the comprehensive stabilization of the\r\nsituation in the region. Our joint efforts should be\r\ndirected at support for the democratic forces in that\r\ncountry and at joint actions to start the democratic\r\nprocess, followed by the provision of opportunities for\r\neconomic prosperity. It is important to reassess the\r\noverall effects of the sanctions, which should not be\r\ndirected at the citizens. We hope that the upcoming\r\nelections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be\r\nfair and democratic, in accordance with European and\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nstandards, and be a step towards that country’s\r\ndemocratization.\r\nRegarding the situation in the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, I would like, in my capacity as Chairman\r\nof the South-East European Cooperation Process, to\r\ninform the Assembly about the joint declaration\r\nrecently adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the\r\nparticipating States in New York. In the declaration we,\r\nthe Foreign Ministers, expressed our concern about the\r\nlatest developments in the situation in the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia as regards the upcoming\r\npresidential and parliamentary elections, and confirmed\r\nour support for the democratic forces in that country\r\nand for its efforts to start the democratic process.\r\nAll of this might contribute to the integration of\r\nthat country into the international community and to its\r\nparticipation in the work of international organizations,\r\nfollowing the path that all the other successor States of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia have taken. Furthermore, the\r\nresolution of the succession issue of the former\r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the basis\r\nof the equality of all successors — as acknowledged by\r\nthe decisions of the European Union/United Nations\r\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, as\r\nwell as by the relevant Security Council and General\r\nAssembly resolutions — is a prerequisite for stability\r\nand peace in the region.\r\nConcerning the issue of succession, I would like\r\nto point out that during the Millennium Summit and\r\nMillennium Assembly, the four successor States have\r\nonce again reaffirmed their joint position and proposed\r\nto work more intensively to settle this issue.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to express our support\r\nfor the stability and the reform processes undertaken in\r\nMontenegro and for the efforts of the democratically\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nelected Government there to continue pursuing\r\neconomic and democratic development. We also\r\nsupport that Government’s greater involvement in the\r\nwork of international bodies and organizations and in\r\nother regional cooperation processes.\r\nThe consistent position of my country, which was\r\nstated well before the outbreak of the Kosovo crisis\r\nand adoption of the Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999), was to support a peaceful and political solution\r\nto the Kosovo crisis through substantial autonomy in\r\nthe framework of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\r\nrespect for the human rights of all living in Kosovo,\r\nrespect for the inviolability of the existing borders and,\r\nfinally, the economic reconstruction and stabilization\r\nof Kosovo and of the region.\r\nWe support the activities of the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the\r\nKosovo Force (KFOR). We are convinced of the need\r\nto build democratic institutions and a multi-ethnic\r\nsociety in Kosovo, and to find a model of civil society\r\nthat does away with any propensity to create ethnically\r\ncleansed territories. The local elections in Kosovo are\r\nof paramount importance for its future.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is concerned about\r\nthe reported violence and the increased number of\r\ninter-ethnic incidents and tensions in Kosovo. We\r\nconsider that KFOR should strengthen its border\r\ncontrol activities, with the aim of preventing violence\r\nfrom spilling over into the neighbouring countries,\r\nincluding my country. I am stressing this because there\r\nhave been several serious incidents at the border of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia.\r\nIn the hope that the developments in Kosovo will\r\nbe the last serious challenge in the Balkans, we will\r\nhave to defend together more successfully democratic\r\nprinciples and values and develop long-term preventive\r\nstrategies. Regional stability can be provided only by\r\neconomic prosperity, democracy and respect for human\r\nrights and the rights of national minorities, as well as\r\nthrough intensive regional and bilateral cooperation.\r\nHowever, the most serious guarantee for the security of\r\nthe region and its transformation into an area of\r\ndemocracy, development, stability and cooperation\r\nremains the early integration and full-fledged\r\nmembership of the countries from the region in the\r\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO).\r\nThis year’s Millennium Assembly presents a\r\ngenuine opportunity to analyse the work of our\r\nOrganization and to evaluate its efficiency in resolving\r\nissues of international interest. We all hope that the\r\ndirections for future development will also be\r\nunderscored, with the aim of further promoting the\r\nachieved results and practices.\r\nOne of the main characteristics of the modern\r\nworld is that now more than ever there is a great deal\r\nof interdependence. This represents a new challenge,\r\nand at the same time is a new feature of international\r\nrelations. Moreover, when everybody is talking about\r\nthe enormous significance of the ever more important\r\nmultilateral character of the international scene and\r\nabout globalization, the question of the equal\r\nparticipation of all the world’s actors is being raised.\r\nThat is, at issue is the official representation of the\r\nvoices of all peoples. In this regard, I would like to\r\nexpress our support for the efforts of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan to become integrated into the\r\ninternational community, taking into consideration the\r\ninterests of that country and also its significant\r\ncontribution to international cooperation and the\r\nsolidarity it has shown. It is in the interest of our\r\nOrganization that the 23 million people of the Republic\r\nof China participate in its activities.\r\nThe negative effects of crises, threats to peace,\r\nsecurity and economic development, and the pollution\r\nof the environment are felt globally. In accordance with\r\nthe new situation in international relations, needs and\r\nvisions, an obvious demand exists to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations. Our Organization can\r\nsuccessfully carry out its activities only if the Member\r\nStates fully contribute to their realization.\r\nIn order to allow the Organization to be able to\r\nplay a successful role in the twenty-first century, it is\r\nnecessary to adequately reform it. We welcome the\r\nefforts made by the Secretary-General thus far to this\r\neffect, and at the same time we would like to urge him\r\nand the Member States to continue. Furthermore, I\r\nwould like to underline that the reform of the United\r\nNations will be successful only if strengthening the\r\nrole of the General Assembly follows the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. In our view, it is necessary to\r\nincrease the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council on the basis of the\r\nnew reality in international relations. These new\r\nmembers should come from both the developing and\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nWhat needs to be done so that the United Nations\r\ncan adequately respond to the challenges of this\r\ncentury? The Millennium Summit offered part of the\r\nanswer. The adopted Millennium Summit Declaration\r\ncreates obligations for all Member States in their future\r\nendeavours. We share the opinion that, although the\r\nDeclaration is a political document, it is first of all an\r\naction plan of our Organization for the period to come.\r\nStressing the importance of the adopted document, I\r\nwould like to urge the General Assembly to begin\r\nimplementing it. In these efforts, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia will actively contribute.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia will also continue to\r\ncontribute to the strengthening of international peace\r\nand security. I emphasize that part of our contribution\r\nto the realization of the issues will be elaborated under\r\nthe three agenda items as a follow-up to the resolutions\r\nsubmitted by the Republic of Macedonia.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity worldwide will continue to be the priority of\r\nour Organization in the twenty-first century. As the\r\nSecretary-General stated in his report, the world, and\r\nour Organization in particular, will be faced with the\r\nneed to be fully involved in conflict prevention,\r\nconflict resolution and the development of the affected\r\nStates. Therefore, prevention should become one of the\r\nprimary instruments of our Organization. In regard to\r\nour contribution to prevention activities and policy, I\r\nwould like to inform the Assembly that in the Republic\r\nof Macedonia an international centre for conflict\r\nprevention and resolution is being established.\r\nOf great importance to stability and security, in\r\nour view, is the control of small arms and light\r\nweapons, which pose a large threat to peace in many\r\nregions of the world. In that connection, the United\r\nNations, in cooperation with other regional\r\norganizations, such as the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), can have a\r\nserious impact on preventing the proliferation of small\r\narms and light weapons.\r\nWe urge the international community to take\r\nstrong measures in its efforts to stop arms trafficking,\r\nespecially of small arms and light weapons. In that\r\nrespect, we hope that that the international conference\r\non this issue, which will take place next year, will\r\ncontribute to more efficient actions.\r\nAmong the reasons for the eruption of a large\r\nnumber of local conflicts worldwide are economic and\r\nsocial factors. Globalization, apart from its positive\r\neffects, has a number of negative implications for the\r\nsmall and least developed economies. Financial\r\nresources for development are necessary; realistically,\r\nthe United Nations is not able to provide them. We\r\nsupport the appeal for the necessary voluntary\r\ncontributions from Member States, but also the idea of\r\ninvolving other participants, such as international\r\nfinancial institutions, the private sector and other\r\nbodies. In this respect, we welcome next year’s\r\ninternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment. I underline that writing off the debts, or\r\npart of them, of countries affected by objective external\r\ninfluences would have a very positive impact. It would\r\nalso help to diminish global poverty and\r\nunemployment and aid the overall economic\r\ndevelopment of the indebted countries.\r\nThe General Assembly is the proper place for\r\nevaluating achievements in the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights and freedoms. There has\r\nbeen an impressive development of international\r\nhuman rights law in the last 50 years. Today we can\r\nproudly state that the United Nations, with the adoption\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\r\nother instruments, succeeded in affirming the\r\ninternational consensus — that human dignity is to be\r\nthe basic standard and the main goal for all people and\r\nnations.\r\nLast year we marked the tenth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,\r\nand next year there will be a world summit on this\r\nissue. I take this opportunity to announce the intention\r\nof the Republic of Macedonia to sign in the very near\r\nfuture the two Optional Protocols to the Convention,\r\nthe first on the involvement of children in armed\r\nconflict and the second on the sale of children, child\r\nprostitution and child pornography.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to single out a\r\nfew issues to which my Government attaches crucial\r\nimportance: first the situation in Africa, both political\r\nand economic; secondly, the Middle East peace\r\nprocess; thirdly, the financial situation of our\r\nOrganization — all Member States should fulfil their\r\nobligations; and, finally peacekeeping operations,\r\nwhich contribute to the affirmation of our Organization\r\non a global scale. This is the right moment for their\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nrestructuring and strengthening on the basis of the\r\nreport (A/55/305) prepared by the Brahimi Panel.\r\nMany challenges await us in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Our obligation is to make the world a better\r\nand happier place to live in. In the realization of that\r\naim, the United Nations has a significant place and\r\nrole. The significance and existence of our universal\r\nOrganization lies in its skilfulness in adapting to real\r\nsituations and future challenges.\r\nWe expect this year’s Millennium Assembly to\r\ncontribute to the realization of this aim. I assure the\r\nAssembly of the Republic of Macedonia’s contribution\r\nto its successful fulfilment.\r\nThe Acting President: (spoke in Spanish) Before\r\ncalling on the next speaker, the Foreign Minister of\r\nAustralia, I draw the attention of Member States to the\r\nappeal in connection with the observance of the\r\nOlympic Truce during the games of the XXVII\r\nOlympiad, held in Sydney, Australia, from 15\r\nSeptember to l October. The appeal was made on 5\r\nSeptember, at the closing of the fifty-fourth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, by the President of the\r\nAssembly for that session, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab.\r\nI now call on His Excellency The Honourable\r\nAlexander Downer, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAustralia.\r\nMr. Downer (Australia): I join my colleagues in\r\ncongratulating the President on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly for its fifty-fifth\r\nsession and you, Madam Vice-President, on your\r\nelection to your position.\r\nI am also delighted to welcome Tuvalu as the\r\n189th Member of the United Nations. Australia has\r\nlong-standing and very friendly relations with Tuvalu,\r\nand we have worked closely together as members of\r\nthe South Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth. We\r\nare pleased that Tuvalu is now a Member of the United\r\nNations, and look forward to new opportunities to work\r\ntogether for the United Nations common goals of peace\r\nand development.\r\nWe meet today just after the largest number of\r\nheads of State and Government in history gathered for\r\nthe Millennium Summit. While the Summit touched on\r\nthe multitude of problems facing the world at the start\r\nof a new century, a theme common to many speeches\r\nwas the need for the United Nations to reform so as to\r\nmeet the challenges of the era: the challenges of\r\nsecuring peace, of fighting poverty and of empowering\r\nand liberating oppressed peoples.\r\nI want to respond to those calls for reform in my\r\nremarks to the Assembly today.\r\nWithout continuing commitment to reform, the\r\nUnited Nations — like any organization — cannot\r\nexpect to keep up with rapid change in the\r\ncontemporary international environment. In the\r\nabsence of change and adaptation, the Organization\r\nwill wither as the nations of the world bypass it in\r\nfavour of institutions and mechanisms that are more\r\nrelevant to their needs.\r\nAustralians believe that the most fundamental\r\ntask of the Organization — and the very reason for its\r\ncreation at the end of the Second World War — is the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In\r\nrecent years we have seen the United Nations perform\r\nat both ends of the spectrum of relevance and\r\neffectiveness: at a low point in addressing problems in\r\nKosovo and Rwanda, and at a high point in the\r\nresolution of the conflict in East Timor.\r\nI am a strong advocate of an active role for the\r\nUnited Nations in the restoration and preservation of\r\ninternational peace and security, especially in situations\r\nwhere there may be imminent danger of humanitarian\r\ncatastrophe. Appropriate action by the United Nations\r\nin these circumstances does more than perhaps\r\nanything else to demonstrate the continuing relevance\r\nof the Organization to an often sceptical international\r\npublic.\r\nToday I want to focus attention on four aspects of\r\nreform within the United Nations system: reform of the\r\nSecurity Council; electoral group reconfiguration;\r\nreform of peacekeeping; and reform of the human\r\nrights treaty committee system. It is our view that\r\nprogress in each of these areas must be achieved to\r\nenable the United Nations to deliver results and ensure\r\nits relevance and effectiveness.\r\nReform and expansion of the Security Council is\r\ndriven by two fundamental, interrelated imperatives:\r\nthe need to restore the representative nature of the\r\nCouncil by reconfiguring its composition to reflect the\r\nsize and diversity of contemporary United Nations\r\nmembership, and the need to enhance the Council’s\r\ncredibility, authority and legitimacy.\r\nThe Australian Government’s view has long been\r\nthat expansion in both categories of membership is\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nneeded to restore balance and equity to the composition\r\nof the Council. New permanent seats should be\r\nassumed by the under-represented developing regions\r\nof the world. New permanent seats should also be\r\nallocated to the major industrialized Powers best able\r\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. Equally importantly, other Members of\r\nthe United Nations should be given the opportunity to\r\ncontribute directly to the work of the Council through\r\nperiodic participation as elected members. Expansion\r\nof the non-permanent membership would enhance the\r\nrepresentative nature of the Council, enabling it to act\r\ngenuinely on behalf of the whole membership.\r\nAustralia has long voiced concerns about the veto\r\nand continues to argue that there must be limitations on\r\nits use. Of course, all permanent members of the\r\nCouncil, old and new, must remain accountable for\r\ntheir performance, and to this end any new\r\narrangements for the Council should be reviewed after\r\n10 or 15 years.\r\nRegrettably, discussion on Security Council\r\nreform has failed to reach agreement on a package of\r\nreforms in the six years since the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup was established. The impasse is disappointing,\r\nand I hope that this session will give new impetus to\r\nthe reform effort. It is clear from statements at the\r\nMillennium Summit, and during this debate, that there\r\nis strong support for reform. Renewed commitment and\r\nflexibility are needed from all sides.\r\nIn the recent debate about United Nations reform,\r\none key element has largely been missing. I refer to the\r\nUnited Nations electoral groups. The electoral groups\r\nwere established to ensure that there was fair and\r\nequitable representation on United Nations bodies, so\r\nthat all Members who wanted to make a contribution to\r\nUnited Nations decision-making would have an\r\nopportunity to do so. Now that three decades have\r\npassed since the formalization of the present groups, it\r\nis time that we focused on their relevance to present\r\nand future geopolitical realities.\r\nThe current group system reflects the geopolitics\r\nof the 1960s. Since that time, more than 60 nations\r\nhave joined the United Nations, leading to significant\r\ndisparities between the size of groupings and an\r\ninadequate level of representation for some subregions.\r\nIn addition, the original rationale for the configuration\r\nof the electoral groups has eroded, creating dissonance\r\nin the way many Member States organize themselves\r\npolitically and electorally.\r\nThe previous realignment of groups in 1963 was a\r\nlong and difficult process, impelled by significant\r\nchanges to the United Nations system after the entry of\r\nmany newly independent States from Africa and Asia. I\r\nrecognize that group reconfiguration is no easy matter,\r\nand accept that change now will be similarly complex.\r\nFor that very reason, we should delay no longer in\r\ncommencing a serious debate of these issues. While\r\nthere are many possible configurations for revised\r\nelectoral groupings, and many sensitivities around\r\naltering the status quo, the dramatic global changes\r\nsince the current system came into force have created\r\nhistorical anomalies that cry out to be redressed.\r\nAustralia looks forward to working with others to\r\nachieve that goal.\r\nAs part of the Australian Government’s\r\ncommitment to a strong and relevant United Nations,\r\nwe recently completed a review of the United Nations\r\nhuman rights committee system, with the objective of\r\nimproving its effectiveness. The review proceeded\r\nfrom our Government’s commitment to the\r\ninternational promotion and protection of human rights,\r\nand a firm belief that the United Nations has a central\r\nrole to play.\r\nAustralia has a proud human rights record, and\r\nwe take our international rights and obligations\r\nseriously. We are party to both human rights Covenants\r\nand to the four conventions. Within Australia, which\r\nhas a strong civil society, human rights are protected by\r\na range of key civil and political mechanisms,\r\nincluding a strong democratic tradition, our\r\nConstitution, an independent judiciary, a free press and\r\nwide-ranging anti-discrimination legislation.\r\nInternationally, Australia is a strong proponent of the\r\nuniversal application of human rights standards and is\r\ncommitted to continued support for international\r\nhuman rights protection.\r\nWe are concerned that the committees established\r\nto monitor international compliance with human rights\r\ntreaties are beginning to lose credibility and\r\neffectiveness because of the way they operate. It is also\r\nimportant that the international protection system work\r\nefficiently and effectively so that democratic countries,\r\nsuch as Australia, which have a proud record of\r\nextending generous humanitarian assistance can\r\ncontinue to have the confidence and support of their\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nown domestic constituencies for such humanitarian\r\nprotection.\r\nAustralia’s review found that the committees\r\nneed to adopt a more consistent approach to their role\r\nand understand the pitfalls of simply accepting without\r\nanalysis the submissions put before them by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. It is important that\r\nadequate recognition be given to the role and views of\r\nGovernments which are democratically elected and\r\nwhich take their treaty commitments and reporting\r\nobligations seriously. The committees also need to be\r\nmore balanced and strategic about targeting key human\r\nrights offenders and avoid unfairly focusing their\r\ncriticism on countries with good human rights records.\r\nFor some years now Australia, together with a\r\nnumber of other countries, including Canada, New\r\nZealand and Norway, has been advocating reform of\r\nthe treaty committees. Most recently, the Australian\r\nMission to the United Nations in Geneva hosted a\r\nmeeting of about 20 countries to discuss treaty\r\ncommittee reform. The United Nations itself has also\r\nrecognized the need for reform of the treaty committee\r\nsystem, and Australia has been fully supportive of\r\nthese international reform efforts.\r\nAustralia now intends to broaden such efforts by\r\nspearheading a high-level diplomatic initiative to\r\ngarner broad support for reforms to improve the\r\nfunctioning of the committees and professionalize their\r\noperations. Reforms could include the provision of\r\nadequate resources to the human rights treaty\r\ncommittees, improvements in their working methods,\r\nstandardized rules of procedure when considering\r\nStates’ reports and better consultation between the\r\ncommittees themselves to coordinate reporting\r\ntimetables and to facilitate cooperative work on reform\r\nissues.\r\nBut Australia does not have a monopoly on good\r\nideas, and we want to work closely with United\r\nNations officials and with like-minded countries to\r\nmake the treaty committee system work more\r\neffectively for the good of all Member States and for\r\nthe protection of human rights.\r\nWe will therefore be talking widely with others to\r\ndevelop concrete proposals for reform. We will raise\r\nthese issues in the General Assembly, at the\r\nCommission on Human Rights and in other appropriate\r\nmeetings. We also think that the regular meetings of\r\nStates parties to the six human rights treaties should\r\ndiscuss reform issues and provide guidance to the\r\nrespective committees on their working methods.\r\nAustralia wants to maximize the effectiveness of\r\nthe treaty bodies. We will not shy away from our\r\nresponsibilities, but will press for the reforms that are\r\nneeded to make the system work well and achieve its\r\nobjectives. If reform does not occur, the committee\r\nsystem will increasingly be ignored and made\r\nredundant. That would be a setback for the cause of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nI now turn to the matter of peacekeeping and the\r\nmaintenance of international security. Australia has a\r\nlong and honourable tradition as a participant in United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations, most recently in East\r\nTimor, and I believe that the strength of our\r\ncommitment is reflected in the recent appointment by\r\nthe Secretary-General of Australian Major-General Tim\r\nFord as his Military Adviser. The experience of the\r\n1990s has clearly shown that the ability of the United\r\nNations to meet an expanding and increasingly\r\ncomplex range of peacekeeping demands is under\r\nstrain. The decade witnessed some important successes\r\nin peacekeeping, notably in East Timor, but also some\r\nsmaller and frankly rather unheralded operations. It\r\nalso saw some tragic failures, the costs of which were\r\noften measured in human lives.\r\nI commend the Secretary-General’s commitment\r\nto blunt scrutiny and review of the United Nations\r\nperformance, including the reports on Srebrenica and\r\nRwanda. We particularly commend his initiative in\r\nconvening the Brahimi Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations. The Brahimi report (A/55/305) is a\r\nlandmark document, setting out a blueprint for\r\nmodernizing the United Nations peacekeeping and\r\nrelated functions. We must move expeditiously to\r\nconsider its recommendations.\r\nLet me highlight briefly five points that, in\r\nAustralia’s view, are among the most significant\r\nlessons of recent experiences.\r\nFirst, military intervention must be used only as a\r\nlast resort. All efforts must be made to find peaceful\r\nsolutions. In this context, we welcome the Brahimi\r\nreport’s emphasis on preventive action and peace-\r\nbuilding.\r\nSecondly, when the United Nations is deployed,\r\nthere must be a peace to keep. There are real dangers in\r\nsending troops indefinitely into harm’s way in the\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.20\r\nabsence of a clear peace plan and reasonable prospects\r\nof achieving it. Disputing parties must be committed to\r\npeace and must be held accountable for their actions.\r\nThirdly, peace operations must have a mandate\r\nfrom the Security Council that is appropriate to the job\r\nthey are being asked to do. If the environment is\r\nhostile, they must be appropriately equipped and able\r\nto project credible force.\r\nFourthly, deployment must take place quickly\r\nonce a decision is taken by the Security Council.\r\nDelays can lead to the further deterioration of a\r\nsituation and can cost lives. The Brahimi report offers a\r\nnumber of useful ideas to speed deployment which\r\nmerit careful consideration.\r\nFifthly, United Nations peace operations must\r\nhave a clear exit strategy. This is linked in particular to\r\nthe clarity of Council mandates: as the Brahimi report\r\nrightly stresses, mandates must be clear, credible and\r\nachievable. It is also linked to the efficacy of\r\naccompanying peace processes and peace-building\r\nefforts.\r\nWe welcome the attention given to these issues in\r\nthe Brahimi report. We also support the point that the\r\nUnited Nations must be given the resources it needs to\r\ncarry out the demands that we make of it. There is no\r\nquestion that the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations needs to be strengthened and reformed.\r\nUltimately, it is our responsibility, as Member States,\r\nto support a stronger and more effective United Nations\r\npeacekeeping capacity. This includes placing the\r\nfinancing of peacekeeping on a surer footing and\r\npaying our assessed contributions in full and on time.\r\nI cannot conclude without referring to the\r\nquestion of East Timor. When I addressed this\r\nAssembly one year ago East Timor was in the throes of\r\nthe most appalling violence at the hands of a brutal and\r\nlawless militia. Since then important progress has been\r\nmade in restoring security and building the foundations\r\nof an independent East Timor. Australia pays tribute to\r\nthe men and women of the International Force in East\r\nTimor and of the United Nations Transitional\r\nAdministration in East Timor for their commitment\r\nand, in too many cases, their sacrifice.\r\nEast Timor faces a long and difficult path to\r\npeace and prosperity. Australia is playing a major role\r\nin the territory’s reconstruction through the United\r\nNations and other organizations, as well as bilaterally.\r\nWe are committed for the long term to helping the East\r\nTimorese build their emerging nation not only for the\r\nbenefit of the East Timorese, but in the interests of\r\nstability and security in our region.\r\nRegrettably, the pro-integration militia continue\r\nto pose a significant threat to security and stability.\r\nIntimidation and violence against Timorese refugees\r\nand humanitarian aid personnel in the camps on the\r\nEast-West Timor border must be halted. The killing of\r\nworkers of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) earlier this\r\nmonth deserves the world’s strongest condemnation.\r\nAustralia reiterates its call on Indonesia to fulfil its\r\nresponsibility to provide effective security in West\r\nTimor, including by bringing to an end militia activity,\r\nbringing to justice those responsible for crimes,\r\ncreating the necessary conditions for the return of\r\nUNHCR and resolving the refugee situation. We urge\r\nthe Indonesian authorities to take all possible steps in\r\nthis direction, including cooperating with the proposed\r\nSecurity Council mission.\r\nIf the United Nations is to remain relevant and\r\ncredible, it must work on its strengths and maintain a\r\nstrong commitment to a continuing programme of\r\nreform and renewal. The challenges that face the\r\nOrganization are formidable, but not insurmountable.\r\nThe need for change is clear and urgent, but I believe\r\nthat it is not beyond the ingenuity and good will of our\r\ngeneration to emulate our predecessors in grasping the\r\nreform nettle.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit the world’s leaders\r\nhighlighted the need for the United Nations to meet the\r\nchallenges of the new century. Let us heed their call,\r\nand work together with renewed determination and\r\ncommitment to make this Organization more\r\nrepresentative and much more effective.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
