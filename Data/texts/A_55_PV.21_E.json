(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nChairman of the delegation of Bahrain, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jassim Mohammed Buallay.\r\nMr. Buallay (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): It is my\r\ngreat pleasure to congratulate you, Mr. President, on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-fifth session and to wish you every success in\r\nyour task. May I also assure you of my delegation’s\r\ncooperation in achieving the objectives we all desire. It\r\nis also my pleasure to thank your predecessor,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his efforts in conducting the\r\nproceedings of the fifty-fourth session, as well as the\r\nproceedings of the special sessions held during the\r\nsame period.\r\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\r\nexpress my deep appreciation for the valuable and\r\nconstant efforts that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has\r\nmade to enable the Organization to deliver its message\r\nand to enhance its role in the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity throughout the world.\r\nMay I also extend my delegation’s\r\ncongratulations to the Government and people of\r\nTuvalu on the occasion of its admission to membership\r\nin the United Nations. Its admission is a further\r\ndemonstration of the universality of the Organization.\r\nThe fifty-fifth session is remarkable because it\r\nalso encompasses the work of the Millennium Summit,\r\nwhich was attended by a large number of leaders of\r\nMember States. The very presence of those leaders, and\r\nthe discussions and meetings they held, served to\r\nunderscore the importance they attach to the role and\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations in the new\r\ncentury. They also identified the changes and\r\nchallenges that will require joint international\r\ncooperation on the basis of the lofty and noble\r\nprinciples and purposes enshrined in the Organization’s\r\nCharter.\r\nMore than half a century after its establishment,\r\nthe world Organization must deal effectively with\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural changes and\r\ntake advantage of their positive impact. This is\r\nparticularly the case with regard to the ongoing and\r\naccelerating revolution in the fields of\r\ncommunications, modern technology and economic\r\nglobalization. In this regard, it is my pleasure to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General’s report to the\r\nMillennium Summit, entitled, “We the peoples: the role\r\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century”. That\r\nreport has shed light on the global issues of the years to\r\ncome and includes the positive aspects, misgivings and\r\napprehensions associated with those issues.\r\nThe State of Bahrain welcomes the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration and the reaffirmation\r\nby Member States of their faith in the Charter’s\r\nprinciples and the need to strengthen the role of the\r\nOrganization. We are confident that if we are\r\nsuccessful in giving effect to those principles, the\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nOrganization will be able to fulfil its political,\r\neconomic, social and human responsibilities. Foremost\r\namong those responsibilities are the preservation of\r\ninternational peace and security and combating disease,\r\npoverty, ignorance, drugs, violence, terrorism and\r\ncrime. Those responsibilities also include preservation\r\nof the environment and natural resources.\r\nWhile the cold war era threatened the world with\r\nthe dangers and risks of war, the ultimate challenges\r\nthe world must face in the future include border\r\ndisputes, racial and ethnic conflict, globalization of the\r\ninternational economy, development issues, and other\r\npolitical, social and environmental challenges, as well\r\nas issues related to weapons of mass destruction and\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe State of Bahrain — whose full integration\r\nand close association with the international community\r\nwas emphasized in the address to the Millennium\r\nSummit by His Highness Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa\r\nAl-Khalifa — is determined to continue to shoulder its\r\nnational, regional and international responsibilities\r\nwith a view to meeting the requirements of the new\r\ncentury. Given its ancient civilization and the fact that\r\nit is fully committed to the obligations associated with\r\nmembership in the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity, Bahrain will deal positively and within the\r\nframework of regional and international cooperation\r\nwith the changes dictated by the new era in such a\r\nmanner as to ensure justice, security, peace and\r\nprosperity for all.\r\nSince it attained political independence and began\r\nto exercise full sovereignty over all its islands,\r\nterritories and territorial waters, in 1971, under the late\r\nEmir, His Highness Shaikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa,\r\nthe State of Bahrain has constantly sought to build a\r\nmodern State and a developed civil society by\r\npreparing and training its people to deal with the\r\nrequirements of the modern age and to take a positive\r\nrole in the changes taking place currently and in the\r\nfuture. Today, in its new era, the State of Bahrain\r\ncontinues its strenuous efforts at modernization and\r\nprogress through domestic openness and by taking\r\nprogressive and measured steps in various fields. Those\r\nsteps include guaranteeing freedoms and ensuring the\r\nrule of law and women’s participation in all aspects of\r\nnational life, notably through membership in the\r\nConsultative Council.\r\nIn the field of human rights, Bahrain continues to\r\ntake considerable steps by signing a number of\r\ninternational conventions in recognition of the\r\nimportance of those rights. Those conventions have\r\nmade the resulting legal rights and obligations\r\nabsolutely clear, while at the same time they firmly\r\noppose the use of human rights as a pretext for\r\ninterfering in internal affairs or for undermining\r\nreligious beliefs, human values and cultural and social\r\ncharacteristics of States.\r\nDespite its continuous efforts and the admirable\r\nstanding it has achieved in the field of human\r\ndevelopment, the State of Bahrain, like other\r\ndeveloping island States, faces a number of challenges\r\nstemming from its limited size, high population density\r\nand limited natural resources. As a result, Bahrain has\r\nundertaken ambitious development projects with a\r\nview to diversifying the sources of its national income.\r\nThose projects include an open economic policy that\r\nhas made Bahrain an advanced regional and global\r\ncommercial and financial centre.\r\nIn the area of foreign relations and the fulfilment\r\nof national and international obligations, the State of\r\nBahrain’s contributions to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security are evidenced by the\r\nclose relations it maintains with brotherly and friendly\r\nStates on the basis of cooperation, mutual interests,\r\nmutual respect and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other States. Driven by its firm belief in the\r\nimportance of regional and international security, the\r\nmaintenance of which is a joint responsibility, and in\r\nthe light of the serious and dangerous events witnessed\r\nby the Gulf region over the last 20 years the effects and\r\nramifications of which continue to pose a threat to the\r\nsecurity and stability of the area, the State of Bahrain\r\nwill continue to call for adherence by all States to the\r\nprinciples that contribute to the maintenance of\r\nsecurity and peace and the prevalence of stability,\r\nprogress and prosperity.\r\nAmong the most important of those principles are\r\nrespect for the status quo and the sanctity of existing\r\nborders; establishment of relations among States on the\r\nbasis of the principles of good neighbourliness, mutual\r\nrespect and non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nother States; recognition of the national sovereignty of\r\neach State; and settlement of disputes through peaceful\r\nmeans and in accordance with the principles of\r\ninternational law accepted by the parties to the dispute.\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nOn this basis, and given its commitment to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nespecially in the strategically important Gulf region, in\r\nwhich many States have vital interests, the State of\r\nBahrain reaffirms its principled and consistent\r\npositions on current regional and international issues.\r\nAccordingly, it renews its invitation to Iraq to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations; to fully implement\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, particularly\r\nthose relating to weapons of mass destruction; and to\r\nrelease prisoners and detainees of Kuwaiti and other\r\nnationalities, as a means leading to the lifting of\r\nsanctions and to an end to the suffering of the brotherly\r\nIraqi people. Meanwhile, it declares anew its call for\r\nthe preservation of Iraq’s independence, sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity and its objection to any\r\ninterference in Iraq’s internal affairs.\r\nWith its deep interest and concern for a continued\r\nspirit of cooperation and good-neighbourly relations\r\namong the Gulf States, the State of Bahrain hopes that\r\nthe positive developments in relations between the\r\nStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran will lead to a peaceful\r\nresolution of the dispute over the three islands — Abu\r\nMusa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb — which all\r\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates. It also reaffirms\r\nits support for all efforts to that end and hopes that the\r\nwork of the tripartite ministerial committee established\r\nby the Gulf Cooperation Council will succeed in\r\nfinding a solution aimed at ensuring the preservation of\r\nthe region’s security and stability, in an atmosphere of\r\namicable and natural relations among all its States and\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Middle East peace process has witnessed,\r\nand continues to witness, developments, both\r\npolitically and on the ground, as evidenced by the\r\ncontacts and negotiations between the Palestinian\r\nAuthority and Israel, including, most importantly, the\r\nCamp David summit, held recently under the auspices\r\nof the United States of America, with a view to\r\nreaching a final agreement between the two parties.\r\nFurther, the contacts that have taken place in\r\nWashington in search of a possible resumption of\r\nnegotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are among the\r\nmost significant developments in the peace process this\r\nyear, despite the failure of such efforts owing to\r\nIsrael’s refusal to withdraw completely from the Syrian\r\nArab Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967.\r\nInsofar as the situation on the ground is\r\nconcerned, the withdrawal from southern Lebanon,\r\nwhich Israel was forced to carry out as a result of the\r\nsteadfast opposition and heroic resistance put up by the\r\nbrotherly Lebanese people against the occupation,\r\nconstitutes a significant turning point in the peace\r\nprocess and demonstrates that occupation can in no\r\nway ensure security.\r\nThe developments through which the peace\r\nprocess has gone on all tracks and in all stages have\r\nshown that the success of the process and the\r\nachievement of the desired just, comprehensive and\r\ndurable peace are contingent upon the implementation\r\nof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973) and of all relevant resolutions of international\r\nlegality, which call for the withdrawal of Israel from all\r\nArab territories occupied since 1967 and acknowledge\r\nthe legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,\r\nincluding the right to establish their own independent\r\nstate, with Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nIn accepting peace, with all the steps it entails, as\r\na strategic option, the Arab side had hoped that Israel\r\nwould implement all these resolutions and fulfil the\r\nterms of all agreements and commitments, as well as\r\nabide by the principles of the 1991 Madrid Conference,\r\nnotably the principle of land for peace.\r\nWe believe that a fully comprehensive solution is\r\na fundamental prerequisite for the achievement of a\r\njust, durable and comprehensive peace in a region\r\nwhose peoples have been beset by conflicts and\r\ninstability, which have drained their resources and\r\nabilities in the context of a heated and futile arms race\r\nthat has deprived all parties of security. In order to save\r\nthe peace process from total collapse and failure, we\r\ncall upon the co-sponsors of the peace process and the\r\ninternational community to redouble their efforts and\r\npressure Israel into meeting the requirements of peace\r\nby fully implementing all resolutions of international\r\nlegality.\r\nDespite the easing of global tensions with respect\r\nto certain regional and international issues, there are\r\nstill issues in a number of different regions that give\r\nrise to concern on the part of the international\r\ncommunity and that threaten security and stability, both\r\nwithin those regions and beyond.\r\nIt is unfortunate that internal strife persists in\r\nAfghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as\r\nwell as in other areas. We therefore call once again for\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nthe intensification of efforts to find solutions to such\r\nconflicts and to encourage the parties to direct their\r\nefforts and capacities towards the settlement of their\r\ndisputes and the development of their countries and\r\nsocieties. We are pleased, in this connection, to\r\nwelcome the recent positive developments in Somalia,\r\nwhich have led to the election of a President in that\r\ncountry. We appreciate all the efforts that have been\r\nexerted towards that outcome, which, we hope, will\r\nbring about security and stability for Somalia and for\r\nits brotherly people.\r\nFurthermore, it is our pleasure to express our\r\nsatisfaction at the agreement reached in Algeria this\r\nyear between two neighbours, Ethiopia and Eritrea, and\r\nour appreciation for the efforts exerted in this direction\r\nby the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nconstructive role played by President Abdelaziz\r\nBouteflika of the brotherly People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic of Algeria.\r\nIt is perhaps true to say that the globalization of\r\nthe economy and the stunning developments in the\r\nfields of information, communications and scientific\r\ninnovation — which have torn down the barriers to the\r\nflow of international trade, facilitated the transfer of\r\ncapital across borders, made interaction among various\r\ncultures inevitable and made every State in the world a\r\nneighbour to all other States — have both pros and\r\ncons and therefore constitute a great challenge for the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe misgivings with regard to globalization have\r\nbeen amply discussed and identified. Foremost among\r\nthese is the fear that it will weaken States’ national\r\nauthority and their ability to act freely in determining\r\nthe levels of their own economic and social\r\ndevelopment, which would have a serious effect on the\r\nliving standard of the peoples of those States. The\r\nsituation therefore requires a reform of the\r\ninternational economic order so as to enable it to deal\r\nwith the financial, economic and social ramifications\r\nand consequent difficulties of globalization, whose\r\nprimary victims are likely to be developing and poor\r\nsocieties.\r\nThe process of economic globalization and\r\ndevelopment has given rise to many challenges for the\r\nworld economy and the international community. The\r\npositive aspects of globalization, as perceived by some,\r\nsuch as the smooth transfer of products, goods and\r\nservices across borders and the immense advances in\r\ninformation technology, should be coupled with a\r\nbalance between global and national economic policies.\r\nDespite the benefits of globalization in the fields\r\nof information technology, electronic commerce,\r\neducation, health, social development, access to\r\nmarkets and consumer benefits through the ability to\r\ncompete, there is fear that globalization’s adverse\r\naspects might affect numerous segments of developing\r\nsocieties that might not have the ability to benefit from\r\nthe opportunities provided by globalization, given their\r\ninability to compete — thereby increasing poverty and\r\nthe marginalization of vast sectors of the population.\r\nIt is in the interest of the international community\r\nthat the progress accompanying globalization be\r\nutilized to achieve economic growth and integration, to\r\nassist in the eradication of poverty and to achieve\r\nsocial equality and development by way of directing\r\nthe process of globalization in a humane manner in\r\norder to mitigate its adverse effects. We must deal with\r\nthis phenomenon in a manner conducive to the\r\nestablishment of a world where a balance of interests is\r\nstruck and where equality, mutual interest and an\r\nhonourable way of life are available to all, without\r\nexception.\r\nIt is our pleasure to express, in this context, our\r\nsupport for the decisions and recommendations of the\r\nSouth Summit held in Havana and the Summit of the\r\nGroup of 15 held in Cairo in June 2000, and the\r\ncontents of the final document of the twenty-fourth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, held in\r\nGeneva last June, to follow up the implementation of\r\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in respect of the human dimension of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAmong the challenges that mankind and our\r\ninternational Organization must address in the new\r\ncentury is the conservation of the environment and the\r\nmitigation of the adverse effects of economic,\r\nindustrial and technological developments in the world.\r\nSuch a task undoubtedly requires a global effort to be\r\nmade within the framework of the continuing\r\nimplementation of the world programme for the\r\nprotection of the environment set out in Agenda 21,\r\nwhich was adopted at the United Nations Conference\r\non Environment and Development, by linking the\r\ninterests of the developed countries with those of\r\ndeveloping countries, while using all means and\r\nmachinery available to fight pollution for the sake of\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nsafeguarding our children and grandchildren from the\r\ndangers of a planet spoiled by human activity.\r\nAnother challenge is the military one posed by\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nnuclear capabilities and their means of transfer, which\r\nhave increased in many regions of the world in the past\r\nfew years. Given the threat to the world’s future,\r\nsecurity and safety that such weapons pose, it is a\r\nwelcome sign for mankind as a whole that the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations have welcomed the\r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in New\r\nYork in April and May 2000, and that the nuclear\r\nPowers have agreed on the total elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nAware of the dangers of the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons, especially in the light of the wars and\r\nconflicts that our region has witnessed in recent\r\ndecades, we in the Middle East, including the Gulf\r\nregion, have supported all initiatives aimed at freeing\r\nthe region from all weapons of mass destruction, in\r\nparticular nuclear weapons.\r\nThe gravity of the phenomenon of terrorism —\r\nwhich has intensified in recent years, challenging the\r\nwill of the international community and posing a threat\r\nto the security and stability of States and peoples — is\r\nof concern to us all. In reaffirming our condemnation\r\nof terrorism, regardless of its form, cause or origin, we\r\ncall for further measures to combat it, to punish its\r\nperpetrators and to prevent them from practising their\r\nactivities by denying them shelter.\r\nIt is incumbent upon us to reaffirm and reactivate\r\nthe role of the United Nations in order to meet and\r\neliminate these challenges in the framework of the\r\ncollective partnership provided for in the Charter, one\r\nof the most important objectives of which is to replace\r\nwar and confrontation with dialogue and cooperation.\r\nWe are convinced, however, that the momentum\r\ngenerated by the Millennium Summit and by the\r\nemphasis in its Declaration on support for the role of\r\nthe United Nations in promoting harmony in\r\ninternational relations and maintaining world peace and\r\nsecurity can be exploited only through the\r\nimplementation of the essential reforms of the\r\nOrganization’s organs and bodies, especially the\r\nSecurity Council, by adhering to the principle of\r\nequitable geographic representation and transparency,\r\nwhich are among the most important elements that\r\nenhance its role in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe advent of the third millennium, with all the\r\nhopes it inspires, requires us all to consider and\r\nevaluate the action we should take to correct the\r\nconcepts and adjust the machinery through which we\r\nhope to achieve peace, security, prosperity and well-\r\nbeing for all in a framework of close international\r\nsolidarity on the basis of the oneness of the human race\r\nand its mutual interests. The unique characteristics of\r\nthe cultures, civilizations, religious beliefs and social\r\ntraditions of various societies and peoples should be\r\nused to promote understanding, rapprochement and\r\ninteraction among all States and peoples in a world of\r\ntranquillity, justice, security and peace.\r\nThe millennium to which we look forward is one\r\nin which we hope relations among peoples will be\r\nenhanced and dialogue and cooperation will replace\r\nwar and conflict, which bring nothing but devastation\r\nand destruction.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Borys Tarasyuk, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Tarasyuk (Ukraine): At the outset, allow me\r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at the current\r\nsession and to wish you every success in discharging\r\nyour duties.\r\nI would also like to pay full tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Minister Gurirab, whose vast diplomatic\r\nexperience and able guidance throughout the fifty-\r\nfourth session greatly contributed to its success and to\r\nthe ultimate triumph of the Millennium Summit.\r\nIt has been only 10 days since the historic event\r\nof the Millennium Summit secured an unprecedented\r\nquorum of the world’s leaders to discuss at the highest\r\nlevel the role and place of the United Nations in the\r\nsystem of international relations in the new era. By\r\nadopting the Millennium Declaration, the international\r\ncommunity clearly demonstrated its support for the\r\nfundamental purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, which continue to be the basis of\r\ninternational law and the main instrument that governs\r\ninternational relations.\r\nUkraine’s active participation in the work of the\r\nMillennium Summit and in the Security Council\r\nSummit, which was held on the initiative of the\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nPresident of Ukraine, testifies to the special importance\r\nthat my country attaches to the activities of this\r\nuniversal Organization.\r\nLike most other States — and the Millennium\r\nSummit unequivocally reconfirmed this — Ukraine\r\ndenounces the threat or use of force as a means of\r\nsolving inter-State problems. We strongly believe that\r\nonly the United Nations possesses both the relevant\r\npowers and the wide range of tools and mechanisms to\r\naddress today’s major global problems. These problems\r\nare the same today as they were several decades ago:\r\nwar, poverty, inequality in distribution of resources,\r\nrepression and discrimination.\r\nHaving gathered on 7 September at the level of\r\nheads of State and Government for the second time in\r\nUnited Nations history, the Security Council reaffirmed\r\nits readiness to bear an essential share of responsibility\r\nfor building a world free of fear, poverty and injustice.\r\nWe consider the most important achievement of\r\nthe Security Council Summit to have been the\r\ncommitment, reaffirmed at the highest level, to\r\nensuring the effective functioning of the system of\r\ncollective security and to enhancing the efficiency of\r\navailable mechanisms for preserving peace and, in\r\nparticular, for conducting peacekeeping operations. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations will not be able\r\nadequately to respond to the challenges to peace and\r\nsecurity in the twenty-first century unless its\r\npeacekeeping potential is enhanced. Ukraine welcomes\r\nthe report of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations, chaired by Ambassador Brahimi. My\r\ncountry finds most of its recommendations substantial\r\nand far-reaching and calls for their speedy\r\nimplementation.\r\nUkraine has always considered United Nations\r\npeacekeeping to be one of the most important raisons\r\nd\u0027etre of this Organization, which is called upon “to\r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war”.\r\nThat is precisely why since 1992 more than 12,000\r\nrepresentatives of Ukraine have participated in 20\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and missions.\r\nSince the beginning of this year, Ukraine, fully\r\nrecognizing its additional responsibility for\r\nmaintaining international peace as a member of the\r\nSecurity Council, has increased twentyfold its\r\ncontribution to peacekeeping operations.\r\nIn the course of the past eight months alone,\r\nUkraine has deployed a contingent of 650 troops with\r\nthe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon\r\n(UNIFIL). We have also sent a group of military\r\nobservers to the United Nations Organization Mission\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC),\r\nto Ethiopia and Eritrea, and have sent a group of\r\ncivilian police to the United Nations Transitional\r\nAdministration in East Timor (UNTAET). The\r\ndeployment of a special Ukrainian police unit of 115\r\nservicemen with the United Nations police force in\r\nKosovo is being completed this week. Our military\r\ncontingent earmarked for the United Nations operation\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo stands in full\r\noperational readiness.\r\nRegrettably, it is common knowledge that human\r\nhistory can be called a chronicle of continuous wars\r\nand conflicts. I hope that at the end of the second\r\nmillennium, having learned from its tragic past,\r\nhumankind has finally grasped the simple truth — that\r\nit is necessary to fight the fires of wars long before\r\nthey have erupted, because even the costliest peace is\r\nmuch better than the cheapest war. This leads me to\r\nemphasize the importance of the most expeditious and\r\neffective implementation of the proposal put forward\r\nby the President of Ukraine at the Millennium Summit\r\nand at the Security Council Summit. He spoke in\r\nfavour of developing a comprehensive United Nations\r\nconflict prevention strategy, based on the large-scale\r\nuse of preventive diplomacy and peace-building.\r\nUkrainian experts stand ready for this work. I am glad\r\nto note that almost all the leaders who addressed the\r\nMillennium Summit recognized preventive action as a\r\npriority for the United Nations in maintaining peace.\r\nIn our view, the concept of regional centres on\r\nconflict prevention can become a practical step towards\r\ndeveloping a relevant United Nations strategy. In this\r\ncontext, Ukraine’s recent proposal to establish a\r\nregional centre for ethnic studies in Kyiv, under the\r\nauspices of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), deserves proper\r\nattention. We think that the activities of such a centre,\r\nauthorized to monitor current developments in the\r\nsphere of inter-ethnic relations in the OSCE region and\r\ndirected at the timely detection of dangerous separatist\r\ntendencies, will be conducive to a further elaboration\r\nof the United Nations preventive strategy in\r\ncooperation with the OSCE.\r\nMy country is keenly following the process of\r\nconflict settlement in the neighbouring Balkans, the\r\ntroublesome region of Europe. While developments in\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nBosnia give us sufficient grounds for optimism about\r\nthe future of its peoples, the situation in Kosovo still\r\ncauses us serious concern. We are confident that a\r\npeaceful settlement in Kosovo has to be pursued in\r\nstrict compliance with Security Council resolution\r\n1244 (1999), with full respect for the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia. In our view, it is impossible to resolve this\r\nproblem without determining the future status of\r\nKosovo following negotiations between the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and the authorized\r\nrepresentatives of the province.\r\nUkraine is determined to intensify efforts aimed\r\nat promoting the final peaceful settlement of the so-\r\ncalled “frozen” conflicts in the post-Soviet territories,\r\nparticularly in Abkhazia, Georgia; Nagorny Karabakh,\r\nAzerbaijan; and Transdniestria, Moldova. As a member\r\nof the group of Friends of the Secretary-General, which\r\nis promoting a peaceful settlement of the almost\r\ndecade-long Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, Ukraine cannot\r\nbut be concerned about the lack of real progress\r\ntowards peace in the region. I once again confirm the\r\ninvitation by President Kuchma to host in Yalta the\r\nnext round of negotiations between the Georgian and\r\nAbkhaz sides aimed at confidence-building.\r\nPresident Kuchma has also presented a feasible\r\nplan for the settlement of the Transdniestria conflict,\r\nbased on the principle of “acquired status” acceptable\r\nto all conflicting parties. Ukraine, together with the\r\nOSCE, is currently examining the possibility of\r\nreorganizing the peacekeeping mission in the region,\r\nwhich will be made up of peacekeeping contingents\r\nfrom Ukraine, Russia and other OSCE members. We\r\nvery much hope that in the long run these initiatives\r\nwill reinvigorate the process of resolving the conflict.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations will always\r\nbe measured by its ability to provide an adequate\r\nresponse to threats to peace and security in every\r\nregion of the world. Today this principle should be\r\nupheld by giving special attention to the problems of\r\nthe African continent. The untold sufferings of the\r\npeoples of Africa, resulting from both intra-State and\r\ninter-State conflicts, are unlike those in any other part\r\nof the globe.\r\nUkraine is determined to make a practical\r\ncontribution to United Nations peace efforts aimed at\r\nresolving conflicts in Africa. This determination is\r\nreinforced by our aspiration to expand trade and\r\neconomic cooperation with our African partners. Let\r\nme repeat the words of the President of Ukraine at the\r\nSecurity Council Summit:\r\n“Ukraine looks forward to a century of African\r\nrenaissance and stands ready to hasten its\r\narrival.” (S/PV.4194, p. 13)\r\nI would like to underline that, in resolving\r\nconflicts in Africa the international community has no\r\nalternative but to promote the need for strict adherence\r\nto the principles of sovereignty, political independence\r\nand territorial integrity of the countries of the region.\r\nThis has to be particularly emphasized in relation to the\r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\r\nmost dangerous challenge to peace at the turn of the\r\ncentury. Ukraine calls on all parties to the Lusaka\r\nAgreement to comply fully with the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and to implement their own\r\ncommitments.\r\nThe recent events in Sierra Leone have become a\r\nserious test for our Organization. They prove the urgent\r\nneed to consolidate international efforts, with a view to\r\nstrengthening the effectiveness of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nI reiterate our position on the need to continue\r\nenhancing the sanctions regime against Angola’s rebel\r\ngroup, UNITA. We are convinced that reducing\r\nUNITA’s ability to wage war is an essential\r\nprerequisite for restoring peace in Angola. It should\r\nalso be borne in mind that the sanctions have to be\r\naccompanied by greater international efforts to resolve\r\nthis long-lasting conflict.\r\nWe note with optimism the latest developments in\r\nthe process of settlement in Somalia. This long-\r\nsuffering nation is painfully but steadily overcoming\r\nthe obstacles in its path to peace and stability.\r\nOver the past year an important step forward was\r\ntaken in advancing one of the integral parts of the\r\nMiddle East peace process — its Israeli-Lebanese\r\ncomponent. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from\r\nsouthern Lebanon in compliance with Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978) has created new conditions for\r\nfurther progress in the whole process. Ukraine\r\nsincerely hopes that Israel and Syria will also be able\r\nto achieve a breakthrough in their stalled negotiation\r\nprocess in the near future, and calls upon the parties to\r\nresume the dialogue as soon as possible.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nWe are following closely the process of solving\r\nthe core issue of the Middle East problem — the\r\nquestion of Palestine. It is our firm belief that the\r\npolitical wisdom and farsightedness of the Israelis and\r\nPalestinians will eventually help them to reach a\r\nmutually acceptable compromise. We welcome the\r\n10 September decision by the Palestinian Central\r\nCouncil to postpone the date of proclamation of the\r\nState of Palestine. Ukraine hopes that, following\r\nstrenuous efforts on both sides, the Palestinian people\r\nwill finally exercise their right to self-determination\r\nand to their own statehood.\r\nThe promotion of disarmament and nuclear non-\r\nproliferation are among the crucial issues before the\r\nUnited Nations and the whole international community\r\nat the turn of the century. We are convinced that those\r\nprocesses should go along with the overall\r\nimprovement of the international situation in other\r\nspheres, the creation and practical implementation of\r\nuniversal security guarantees, unconditional adherence\r\nby States and international organizations to the norms\r\nand basic principles of international law and the\r\nconsolidation of an atmosphere of mutual trust.\r\nAs a country which has made outstanding\r\ncontributions to the process of practical nuclear\r\ndisarmament, Ukraine fully shares the concern that the\r\nattention of the international community to this issue\r\nhas substantially decreased. We believe that nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation are the cornerstones\r\nof international security and a means of averting a\r\nglobal conflict. In our view, achieving the universality\r\nof the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the\r\nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty is the best way to\r\nprevent nuclear proliferation and to ensure the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. It is the nuclear States\r\nthat should be in the vanguard of this process.\r\nThe problem of illegal arms trafficking, which\r\nhas acquired a global dimension, also requires a\r\nuniversal approach to its solution. The key role of the\r\nUnited Nations is indispensable in consolidating the\r\ninternational efforts to fight this evil.\r\nTurning now to the problem of the Security\r\nCouncil-imposed sanctions, I would like to reaffirm the\r\nposition of my country on this issue. Sanctions were\r\ndesigned as a powerful tool to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the Council’s decisions. However,\r\nthey were eventually turned into ineffective and\r\nsometimes even harmful instruments. It is therefore\r\nabsolutely necessary to develop a clear and coherent\r\nmethodology for the imposition and lifting of sanctions\r\nthat takes into consideration the concerns of innocent\r\ncivilian populations and the interests of third countries.\r\nUkraine supports the recent Security Council\r\npractice of defining time limits of sanctions at the stage\r\nof their imposition. We believe that it is of primary\r\nimportance to develop objective criteria and\r\nmechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of sanctions\r\nand their impact — including on the target State. We\r\nalso support the immediate lifting of sanctions when\r\nthere are sufficient grounds to believe that they have\r\nserved their purpose. This is indeed the case as far as\r\nthe sanctions against Libya are concerned, where the\r\nSecurity Council should move, as soon as possible, to\r\nthe next stage and take a long-overdue action.\r\nAmong the major challenges of the new century,\r\nthe problem of HIV/AIDS occupies a special place.\r\nAIDS has become an epidemic of global proportions\r\nwith enormous human and social ramifications that go\r\nfar beyond the province of health alone. The time has\r\ncome for the United Nations to elaborate a\r\ncomprehensive agenda for action against this\r\npandemic. Aware of the magnitude of this problem, the\r\ndelegation of Ukraine, together with other sponsors has\r\npromoted the convening, as a matter of urgency, of a\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on that\r\nquestion. We are encouraged by the wide support for\r\nthis idea and look forward to further work towards its\r\nrealization.\r\nWe are convinced that the multilateral forms of\r\ninternational cooperation have played and will continue\r\nto play a decisive role in the attainment of the goals of\r\nsustainable development. We support the reform efforts\r\nof the Administrator of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for improving the\r\nsituation in the field of mobilization of resources and\r\nenhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of its work.\r\nDuring the difficult period of economic\r\ntransition, the assistance to Ukraine by UNDP plays an\r\nimportant role by streamlining the efforts of various\r\ninternational partners. It also helps to alleviate the\r\ncomplex problems related to the elimination of the\r\nChernobyl disaster’s consequences and the\r\ndecommissioning of the Chernobyl nuclear power\r\nplant.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour gratitude to the countries participating in the July\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\ndonors’ conference in Berlin, which pledged more than\r\n$320 million of additional funding for the\r\ntransformation of the shelter facility into an\r\nenvironmentally safe system. Almost $50 million still\r\nneeds to be raised to reach the amount required, and we\r\ncount on continuing international assistance in this\r\nregard. I believe this could be effectuated within the\r\nframework of the United Nations Chernobyl\r\nprogramme. Let me underline that these funds will be\r\naimed mainly at the implementation of realistic\r\nobjectives, specifically the decommissioning and\r\neventual closing down of the Chernobyl nuclear power\r\nplant by 15 December 2000, a decision that was\r\nreconfirmed by the President of Ukraine at the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nWe also hope that consideration at the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly of the item relating to\r\nthe integration of the countries with economies in\r\ntransition into the world economic system will make it\r\npossible to elaborate a common strategy to solve\r\nspecific problems of these countries.\r\nIn this context, we attach great importance to the\r\naccession of Ukraine to the World Trade Organization.\r\nInternational economic cooperation at the regional\r\nlevel is also of significance for Ukraine. I mean, in\r\nparticular, the development of our relations with the\r\nEuropean Union and interaction within the framework\r\nof the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization\r\nand the Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and\r\nRepublic of Moldova (GUUAM) group.\r\nFulfilling the concept of “human rights for all” in\r\nthe next century is a task of global dimension. That is\r\nwhy strengthening and improving the international\r\nmonitoring of human rights violations becomes\r\nparticularly acute today. At the same time, we remain\r\nconvinced that the use of force cannot be considered an\r\nadequate means of ensuring respect for human rights.\r\nI wish to emphasize that adherence to and\r\nprotection of human rights became the key policy\r\nprinciple of my country. Ukraine has signed and\r\nratified all basic international documents in the field of\r\nhuman rights and put in place at the national level\r\neffective mechanisms for their implementation. This\r\nyear Ukraine adopted a decision to abolish capital\r\npunishment.\r\nThe time that has passed since the historic Rome\r\nConference clearly reaffirmed the epoch-making\r\nsignificance of the document it adopted. We consider\r\nthe International Criminal Court the only viable\r\ndemocratic mechanism of a universal character to\r\nenforce compliance with and respect for international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nI would like to join previous speakers in\r\nexpressing our great hopes for the continuing role of\r\nthe United Nations in bringing solutions to global\r\nproblems. Given the complexity and the\r\nmultidimensional nature of this task, our Organization\r\nneeds to stand on a solid financial footing. We hope\r\nthat this session will enable us to speed up the process\r\nof reforming and improving the mechanisms of the\r\napportionment of the United Nations expenses on the\r\nbasis of objective economic criteria. Therefore, the\r\nprocess of United Nations reform, initiated three years\r\nago, should get additional impetus.\r\nThere is also a need to reactivate the efforts\r\naimed at Security Council reform, which is the key\r\nelement within the process of renewing the United\r\nNations. This was rightly emphasized in the statements\r\nof many world leaders at the Millennium Summit.\r\nThe absence of substantive progress on this issue\r\nlimits the capacities of the Council as the major\r\ninstrument of collective security. I would like to\r\nreiterate the position of Ukraine that the Security\r\nCouncil’s comprehensive reform should be based on\r\nthe norms and principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nIn our view, increased representation in the Security\r\nCouncil for all regional groups should remain an\r\nessential principle. The interests of both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries have to be taken into account.\r\nUkraine believes that the necessary balance within an\r\nexpanded Security Council can be achieved through an\r\nincrease in both categories of its members.\r\nBy pursuing the path of strengthening the United\r\nNations and building up its institutions on democratic\r\nfoundations, the international community reinforces its\r\nown capacity to meet the challenges of the time and to\r\ncreate a climate of justice in international relations and\r\nan atmosphere of mutual respect between States,\r\npeoples and civilizations.\r\nIn the course of the historic Millennium Summit,\r\nthe international community, enriched by this\r\nOrganization’s half-century of experience, outlined the\r\nroad map to be followed by mankind in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Only by intensifying concerted and resolute\r\nefforts to attain our determined goals will we realize\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nthe ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. After\r\nall, this is the only raison d’être for our Organization.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Vartan Oskanian, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Armenia.\r\nMr. Oskanian (Armenia): Allow me to join my\r\ncolleagues in congratulating you, Sir, on your election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly. I am\r\nconfident that this fifty-fifth session will be most\r\neffective and successful under your guidance. I would\r\nalso like to express our appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Gurirab, for his skilful leadership, and\r\nI welcome Tuvalu to the United Nations as a new\r\nMember.\r\nHere in this great city just two weeks ago, an\r\nunprecedented number of heads of State gathered and\r\noutlined the challenges facing the world in the new\r\nmillennium, together with their nations’ achievements\r\nand their visions for the future. It is true that the\r\nmyriad views expressed differed in perspective, focus,\r\nattitude and outlook, but it is also true that the leaders\r\nof the world left the Summit having renewed their\r\ncommon commitment to universal values and\r\nprinciples and to a more peaceful and prosperous\r\nworld. All these were clearly reflected in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report and the Millennium Declaration,\r\nwhich provide us with a blueprint for a common\r\nagenda in the years to come.\r\nThis is a global agenda to meet global goals, but,\r\nas is often said, all politics is local and everything\r\nbegins at home. Therefore, in the final analysis, it is\r\neach individual State that must take up the\r\nresponsibility in its own country and region to make a\r\ndifference that will have a cumulative impact on the\r\nquality of the world in which we all live. Armenia is\r\ncognizant of its own responsibility and is committed to\r\ndoing its part to enhance regional peace and security\r\nand to elevate the quality of life of everyone involved.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s millennium report\r\ngroups our global challenges under three blunt\r\nheadings: freedom from want, freedom from fear and\r\nthe freedom of future generations to sustain their lives\r\non this planet.\r\nGlobalization is expected to drive economic\r\ndevelopment around the world in order to allow future\r\ngenerations to sustain their lives and to make possible\r\nthe kind of economic self-sufficiency we all want for\r\nour peoples. The major task of Governments around\r\nthe world today is the pursuit of sound policies and\r\nappropriate structural adjustments to meet the\r\nchallenges that globalization presents and to take\r\nadvantage of the opportunities it offers without falling\r\nvictim to the hazards it threatens.\r\nAt the same time, the revolution in\r\ncommunication and information technologies has\r\nopened up the global market to new players.\r\nInformation technology and the Internet have become\r\nthe moving engines for economic growth and, at the\r\nsame time, if used appropriately, its great equalizers.\r\nThey hold the promise of unlimited progress and allow\r\neven small and landlocked countries to take advantage\r\nof global access in almost every area of their lives.\r\nArmenia is fully cognizant of this and has made\r\ninformation technology development the axis of its\r\neconomic growth. We have already taken concrete\r\nsteps towards bolstering the development of\r\ninformation technology and telecommunications and,\r\ntogether with foreign investors, have begun preliminary\r\nwork towards an information technology industrial\r\npark on the outskirts of the capital.\r\nAt the same time, well aware that Armenia’s\r\neducational system must be up to matching this call for\r\ninfusing the existing intellectual capacity and talent\r\nwith new skills, we will ensure that education\r\ncurriculums include computer literacy and Internet\r\nfamiliarity. By 2005, all our schools will have\r\ncomputer capabilities with unlimited Internet access.\r\nFreedom from want and freedom from fear go\r\nhand in hand. Without a free, democratic, open system\r\nat home and peace and security in our neighbourhood,\r\nit is not possible to achieve economic prosperity.\r\nDuring the nine years since the establishment of\r\nArmenia’s independence, we have made great strides in\r\nanchoring democratic values, the rule of law and\r\nrespect for human rights in our society. This year, with\r\nArmenia’s membership in the Council of Europe, these\r\nprocesses will become irreversible. The responsibilities\r\nassociated with membership will strengthen and\r\nreinforce all that has been achieved to date.\r\nEconomic prosperity also hinges on regional\r\nstability. At the same time, long-term peace, security\r\nand prosperity in our region depend on its equitable\r\neconomic development and the development of\r\nmultifaceted economic arrangements among countries\r\nand regional organizations. It is apparent that the new\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nenvironment of coexistence requires new approaches\r\nfrom international organizations. Regional and\r\nsubregional integration has become politically and\r\neconomically expedient. This is especially true in the\r\nCaucasus, which is emerging as a region for competing\r\npolitical and economic interests. We look at our\r\nsecurity not only in a bilateral, but also in the broader\r\nregional European context. We are convinced that, in\r\nthe long run, our national security must be anchored in\r\nregional stability.\r\nWe are confident that economic cooperation will\r\nhelp us transcend political problems and facilitate the\r\nresolution of political issues. A stable and democratic\r\nCaucasus is a work in progress. Still, the promise of\r\ndemocracy in the region must not shroud the fragility\r\nof the emergent equilibrium. We recognize and\r\nwelcome the constructive role that the United Nations\r\nand other international organizations — such as the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the Council of Europe, the Black Sea\r\nEconomic Cooperation and the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States — can and must play to consolidate\r\nthis regional equilibrium. Armenia intends to expand\r\nits cooperation within those organizations and more\r\nactively to participate in various regional institutions.\r\nThese diverse bodies, however, must not, by the\r\nuneven or inconsistent application of their principles,\r\nexacerbate existing regional disparities. Armenia is\r\nconfident that the Caucasus is in need of a regional\r\nsystem for stability and security and we stand ready to\r\nwork towards its formation. We were the first to\r\npropose, last year at the OSCE Istanbul Summit, the\r\nbeginning of a process towards comprehensive regional\r\nsecurity leading to a stability pact for the region.\r\nArmenia has adopted and will abide by its policy of\r\ncomplementarity, conducting relations with all\r\ncountries which have political or economic interests in\r\nthe Caucasus. This approach has worked quite\r\neffectively over the past several years and we believe\r\nthat it has contributed to the reduction of polarization\r\nand tension in the region.\r\nHowever, the region continues to remain\r\nadversely affected by the lack of formal relations\r\nbetween Armenia and our neighbour, Turkey. Although\r\nArmenia, from day one of its independence, opted for\r\nthe normalization of relations and the establishment of\r\ndiplomatic ties, Turkey insisted and continues to insist\r\non certain conditions related to Nagorny Karabakh and\r\nthe recognition of the Armenian genocide.\r\nTen days ago at the Summit, from this podium\r\nPresident Kocharian addressed this issue and extended\r\na hand to our neighbour in order that we might together\r\nfind a way to live with the truth of the past without\r\njeopardizing the promise of the future. Unfortunately,\r\nTurkey’s response indicated that it continues to let the\r\nfear of history limit its freedom to act. However, there\r\nis no national history in a vacuum. France and\r\nGermany, England and France, the United States and\r\nJapan, in order to transcend their histories of conflict,\r\nwar and hatred, had to transcend the past together.\r\nIndeed, many nations have founded their spiritual and\r\nmoral resurrection on exorcising their guilt, on the\r\nsearch for validation through truth, on facing their own\r\npast squarely. Redemption and reconciliation without\r\ntruth will remain forever elusive.\r\nThe Millennium Summit Declaration addressed a\r\ntopic that is very important in relation to Armenians’\r\nright to freedom from fear. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration provided for the right to self-determination\r\nof peoples who remain under colonial domination and\r\nforeign occupation. In Nagorny Karabakh, there was\r\nboth colonial domination by the Soviets and foreign\r\noccupation by Azerbaijan, which was illegally and\r\nunjustly given jurisdiction over the Armenian region in\r\n1923. For a people whose compatriots lay just over the\r\nborder, but out of reach, such a divisive act and the\r\nensuing double layer of subjugation was untenable.\r\nDuring the decades of Soviet rule and then after the\r\ncollapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the\r\nArmenians of Nagorny Karabakh resorted to\r\ndemanding their right to self-determination, the refusal\r\nof which led to military conflict, refugees and loss of\r\nlife.\r\nDuring the last six years, the military phase of the\r\nconflict has ceased, and Armenia remains committed to\r\na lasting resolution that will provide for peace and\r\nsecurity for Nagorny Karabakh, with a continuous\r\ngeographical link with Armenia. We will continue to\r\nwork intensely with the co-chairs of the Minsk Group\r\nand wish to underscore their contribution to\r\nmaintaining the ceasefire regime. With equal fervour,\r\nwe are ready to maintain direct contacts with\r\nAzerbaijan in order to search for compromise.\r\nHowever, we think that direct negotiations between\r\nAzerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh would be more\r\nproductive, as it is the people of Karabakh who will\r\nultimately determine their own destiny and future.\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nIn his report the Secretary-General rightly stated\r\nthat today more wars are being fought within States\r\nthan between them. Yet no attempt is being made to\r\naddress this new challenge in a more effective,\r\nmeaningful and realistic way.\r\nEach conflict must ultimately be addressed on its\r\nown terms, and through the actions and the\r\naccommodations of its own peoples and its political\r\nleaders. What the international community can do is\r\nprovide not only the support and the potential\r\nincentives for this process of transformation, but also\r\nthe intellectual, conceptual models for exploring\r\nappropriate and suitable arrangements for the\r\nresolution of seemingly intractable conflicts. We\r\nbelieve that in designing appropriate frameworks\r\nwithin which hostile parties can find a common\r\nlanguage, reassurances may be designed in a flexible\r\nmanner which must be specifically geared to\r\naddressing particular types of conflicts. If I may be\r\nallowed a truism, we should think along the lines of\r\n“form follows function”. The function of the probable\r\nsolutions that must emerge, as well as the broad outline\r\nof an eventual peace agreement, must rely, we believe,\r\non devices or principles that are tailor-made, highly\r\nspecific and perhaps even unique. Without that kind of\r\ncustomization, we believe that generic, standard-issue\r\nformulas will not be well-suited to the resolution of the\r\nconflict in which we find ourselves at this moment\r\ndeeply involved, and whose long-term outcome is of\r\ngreat concern to us.\r\nFor us, peace in Nagorny Karabakh represents, of\r\ncourse, the promise of transforming a situation of\r\nhostility and confrontation with our neighbour,\r\nAzerbaijan, into one of cooperation and mutually\r\nreinforced security. We would like to think of the day\r\nwhen Karabakh is transformed from being a chasm\r\nseparating our countries into a bridge built for the\r\nbenefit of all the populations concerned.\r\nThe political document adopted by the\r\nMillennium Summit sets the guidelines for the\r\ndevelopment of the United Nations in the coming\r\nyears. Armenia is confident that this Organization,\r\ngiven its outstanding role and track record, has the\r\ncapacity to address the new challenges in a most\r\nsatisfactory manner. The vast experience accumulated\r\nover the last five decades can be successfully applied\r\nto secure peace and stability all over the world.\r\nHowever, in response to today’s new challenges\r\nand new demands, United Nations reforms must be\r\ncarried through to strengthen this dynamic\r\norganization. With the proposed expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council, that strategic body will become more\r\nrepresentative, and its decisions will be endowed with\r\ngreater authority.\r\nMay the twenty-first century be the one that sees\r\nall nations united in shared goals and collective action.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Habib Ben Yahia, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nTunisia.\r\nMr. Ben Yahia (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I am\r\nparticularly pleased to express my congratulations to\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Your great diplomatic\r\nexperience and your thorough knowledge of\r\ninternational affairs are the best guarantees for the\r\nsuccess of this session. While assuring you of the\r\nreadiness of our delegation to fully cooperate with you,\r\nwe would like to wish you the utmost success as you\r\ncarry out your responsibilities.\r\nAllow me also to express my thanks to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the remarkable\r\nrole he played during the previous General Assembly\r\nsession. His efforts made it possible to achieve positive\r\nresults in the review and resolution of many issues.\r\nThe Millennium Assembly takes place at a time\r\nwhen the world is at the crossroads of two different\r\neras. This makes it particularly important that this\r\nfifty-fifth session provide us with the opportunity to\r\ntake stock of what we have achieved together and to\r\nbegin developing a forward-looking strategy that will\r\nallow us to face the current challenges. We can identify\r\nand face these challenges only within the framework of\r\na multidimensional, international partnership in the\r\npolitical, economic, social and development spheres.\r\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and his peers\r\nwho met at the Millennium Summit have underlined\r\nthe main challenges that the international community\r\nmust face. These challenges should set priorities for\r\nour joint efforts in the next stage, so that we can make\r\nthe next millennium a millennium of international\r\npartnership, of the development of joint strategies, of\r\nthe promotion of societies and satisfying their multiple\r\nneeds, of the struggle against poverty and epidemics, of\r\nconflict prevention and of the establishment of a lasting\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nbasis for peace and international security. In other\r\nwords we should make this millennium truly a\r\nmillennium of the common future of mankind.\r\nThe Declaration adopted by the Millennium\r\nSummit is a document of historical importance. It\r\npaves the way for the future work of the international\r\ncommunity within the framework of the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations. In the\r\nDeclaration world leaders reaffirmed these purposes\r\nand principles and renewed their commitment to them.\r\nThey also reaffirmed their adherence to the United\r\nNations as the only forum for the expression of the\r\ninternational community’s choices for the future and as\r\nthe ideal instrument for achieving our collective\r\naspirations.\r\nAt the end of the last millennium there were\r\nseveral major summits — including the Millennium\r\nSummit, the South Summit, the Non-aligned\r\nMovement summit and the two special sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, devoted to social development and\r\nwomen. The results of these summits and meetings, the\r\nvisions expressed and the decisions taken regarding the\r\nfuture of international relations provide an important\r\npoint of reference that makes it possible to develop a\r\nglobal and consensual strategy in order to build a true\r\npartnership between peoples and nations. The goal of\r\nthis partnership should be to take up the future\r\nchallenges together.\r\nAmong the lessons we have learned from these\r\nhistoric meetings was the consensus reached by all\r\ncountries on the need for a renewed vision of the\r\nworking methods that we have followed every year in\r\nrecent decades in order to adapt to the requirements of\r\nour time, when different aspects of international life in\r\nthe political, economic and social spheres are all\r\ninterlinked.\r\nThe challenges of our modern world require a\r\nglobal vision and common action that would take into\r\naccount the link between peace, security and\r\nsustainable development based on a political approach\r\nthat combines democracy, human rights and good\r\ngovernance, as well as overall strategies for the fight\r\nagainst poverty on an international scale. Indeed,\r\npoverty has been identified by major international\r\nauthorities and also in the statements that emerged\r\nfrom the Millennium Summit and the Security Council\r\nas well as by the Secretary-General in his reports to the\r\nMillennium Summit and to the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fifth session as one of the main causes of\r\ninternational economic imbalance and as a source of\r\ninstability, conflict and tension in many regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nIn our opinion, the international community is\r\ncalled upon today to objectively develop a concept of\r\ninternational peace and security as well as the means to\r\npreserve them. It is called upon to adopt a broader\r\nconcept that takes into account not only the direct\r\ncauses of wars, conflicts and tensions, but also their\r\nentrenched roots and the means to resolve them in\r\norder to ensure their prevention and to guarantee peace\r\nand security. The last decade has shown the magnitude\r\nof the means that are required to resolve conflicts and\r\ntensions throughout the world. This has generated a\r\nweakening of international will when true and direct\r\nparticipation in the quest for solutions to the many\r\nconflicts was needed.\r\nThe United Nations, despite its limited resources,\r\nremains the main actor that can resolve these conflicts.\r\nPrevious experiences have taught us, among other\r\nthings, that the principle of conflict prevention remains\r\nthe best way to avoid conflicts and the resultant human\r\ntragedy and economic and social damage, which are\r\ndifficult to remedy.\r\nIndeed, within this international forum, we must\r\nwork with regional organizations and international\r\nfinancial institutions to implement a strategic plan of\r\naction with new dimensions that would enshrine the\r\nprinciple of prevention as the main way to avoid\r\nconflicts and to deal with their deep and structural\r\ncauses, through a global vision that would take into\r\naccount the pressing needs of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Experience has proved that stability and\r\ninternal harmony within and between countries will not\r\nbe achieved without national development and\r\ninterdependent interests.\r\nIt is difficult indeed to imagine how a society can\r\nengage in internal violence or get involved in an\r\nexternal conflict if its interests are protected and if it\r\nenjoys well-being and prosperity — both fundamental\r\nconditions for peace and stability.\r\nThis vision conforms to the reform process under\r\nway at the United Nations, in the Security Council and\r\nat international financial institutions that have realized\r\nthat the cost of prevention is far lower than the cost of\r\npost-conflict reconstruction, especially since certain\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nconsequences, those that affect human beings, are\r\ndifficult to remedy.\r\nIt is therefore high time that industrialized\r\ncountries and international financial institutions\r\nhonoured their commitments towards disadvantaged\r\nregions and countries in the form of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, by encouraging foreign\r\ninvestment and by settling the debt problem, including\r\nthe servicing of the debt, in order to meet the\r\nrequirements of development and to contribute\r\neffectively to formalizing the idea of prevention based\r\non multifaceted international aid.\r\nBefore concluding my comments on the matter of\r\npeacekeeping and international security in this new\r\ninternational environment, I would like to underline the\r\nfollowing. First, there is a need to introduce necessary\r\nreforms into United Nations procedures when it comes\r\nto peacekeeping operations, especially since the\r\nactivities of our Organization are no longer limited to\r\ntraditional missions, but also encompass disarming and\r\nreintegrating combatants, removing landmines,\r\nestablishing State institutions and monitoring elections.\r\nThese new missions require greater material and\r\nhuman resources, as well as collective efforts. Of\r\ncourse, this requires a substantial strengthening of\r\nUnited Nations preventive capabilities.\r\nExperience has shown that the success of\r\npeacekeeping operations depends on the prior consent\r\nof the parties concerned, on a clear mandate and on the\r\navailability of necessary resources.\r\nWe have also observed through our experience in\r\npeacekeeping operations that serious problems do exist,\r\nespecially when it comes to delays in reimbursing\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nThe report of the group of experts, developed\r\nunder the chairmanship of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\r\ncontains important recommendations that command our\r\nattention and deserve in-depth study, especially since\r\nthey deal with all aspects of peacekeeping operations.\r\nSecondly, the role of the Security Council in\r\npeacekeeping and international security is crucial and\r\nindispensable. It draws its strength from the fact that it\r\nis a universal tool and that it embodies international\r\nlegality.\r\nAs always since the 1960s, Tunisia remains ready\r\nto meet the United Nations calls, as well as those of the\r\ninternational community, to take part in peacekeeping\r\noperations throughout the world. Given the priority of\r\nthe security of personnel serving in peacekeeping\r\noperations, in July Tunisia ratified the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel.\r\nThe need to introduce reforms to the Security\r\nCouncil is dictated today by international\r\ndevelopments that have taken place since the adoption\r\nof the Charter. In this context, increasing the number of\r\npermanent and non-permanent members of that body\r\non the basis of equitable geographic distribution is an\r\nurgent demand. We would like to stress the need to\r\nreach a consensus that would make it possible to\r\nincrease the number of permanent members.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to recall that Tunisia\r\nsupports the candidacy of Japan, Germany and other\r\ncountries. An eventual solution should preserve the\r\ninterests of all international parties and make it\r\npossible to satisfy the demands of developing countries\r\nand, above all, African countries, which are entitled to\r\ntwo permanent seats on the Security Council, to be\r\ndistributed according to the rule of rotation. It is also\r\nnecessary to improve the working methods of the\r\nCouncil in order to ensure that its work is marked by\r\ntransparency and effectiveness. Since acceding to the\r\nSecurity Council as a non-permanent member, Tunisia\r\nhas tried to ensure that its contribution to the work of\r\nthat body is based on dialogue with the other members\r\nin order to bring viewpoints closer together and to\r\nreach results that would guarantee the success of all\r\nendeavours to safeguard peace and international\r\nsecurity.\r\nAlong the same lines, with respect to the role of\r\nthe Security Council, we cannot overlook the question\r\nof humanitarian intervention, which has been the\r\nsubject of widening debate in recent years and whose\r\nreview calls for particular and sustained attention.\r\nWe stress the need for an in-depth examination of\r\nall aspects of this matter. Indeed, if a particular\r\nhumanitarian situation requires urgent intervention so\r\nthat it does not deteriorate, such intervention cannot\r\ntake place outside the framework of international law,\r\nthe basic principles and norms of international relations\r\nand the provisions of the United Nations Charter. State\r\nsovereignty remains a fundamental tenet that can never\r\nbe overlooked or ignored, because any violation of this\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nprinciple would alter the balance of international\r\nrelations and risk the spread of anarchy.\r\nThe question of sanctions is one of the most\r\nimportant issues that United Nations bodies, including\r\nthe Security Council, have to face. The experience of\r\nthe past decade has shown that the use of sanctions\r\nmust be modified so as to alleviate their impact on\r\npeoples, while certain criteria, such as their use as a\r\nlast resort after all other peaceful means have been\r\nexhausted, must be applied.\r\nIn cases in which the imposition of sanctions is\r\nnecessary, their duration should be limited. We should\r\nalso define clear conditions for the lifting or\r\nsuspension of sanctions and undertake an ongoing\r\nassessment of their humanitarian effects on the\r\npopulation of the target countries, as well as their\r\ndirect impact on the interests of third countries.\r\nIn this connection, with regard to Iraq, Tunisia\r\nhas always reaffirmed the need to unite all our efforts\r\nin order to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute\r\nthat would make it possible to end the embargo,\r\nreintegrate Iraq into the community of nations, put an\r\nend to the tragic suffering of the Iraqi people resulting\r\nfrom the sanctions imposed over the past 10 years and\r\nhelp to direct the efforts of the countries of the region\r\nand their peoples towards the achievement of\r\ndevelopment and stability. All parties must cooperate\r\nin order to resolve the other humanitarian aspects of\r\nthe problem, in particular the issue and fate of missing\r\nKuwaiti nationals.\r\nWith regard to the Lockerbie affair, the recent\r\ndevelopments following the implementation of the\r\nagreement concluded on the matter and the suspension\r\nof the embargo imposed on Libya, it is time for\r\nsanctions to be lifted completely and definitively in\r\norder to allow the Jamahiriya to continue its overall\r\ndevelopment process and to support the Arab Maghreb\r\nUnion (AMU) as it strives to achieve the integration\r\nand complementarity on which all of its member States\r\nplace great importance. Tunisia has made the AMU a\r\nstrategic choice. It is constantly working to promote\r\nthe Union and to strengthen its foundations and\r\nstructures. With the help of its partners in the Union, it\r\nhas tried to give this regional organization new impetus\r\nso that it can respond to the historic aspirations of its\r\npeoples.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, we would like to\r\nexpress our regret that the negotiations at the Camp\r\nDavid summit meeting held in July stalled without an\r\nagreement that would guarantee a fair settlement of the\r\nPalestinian cause. Tunisia, which from the outset has\r\nsupported the peace process on all tracks, is convinced\r\nthat it is time to give concrete form to the legitimate\r\naspirations of the Palestinian people to build an\r\nindependent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\r\ncapital, in accordance with international law and the\r\nterms of reference of the peace process based on the\r\nprinciple of land for peace. Tunisia hopes that the\r\nAmerican Administration will continue its good\r\noffices, and that other influential parties, such as the\r\nEuropean Union, Russia and Japan, will step up their\r\nefforts to help the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli\r\nGovernment reach an agreement that would make it\r\npossible to establish a just and lasting peace and\r\nguarantee the national rights of the Palestinian people\r\nin accordance with General Assembly and Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, in particular Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nAchieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast will also depend on progress on the Syrian track.\r\nIsrael is called upon to withdraw from the Golan and to\r\ncomply fully with Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973). Israel is also called upon to\r\nrespect the international borders of Lebanon and to\r\nrefrain from violating the borders drawn by the United\r\nNations.\r\nOur States are encouraged to try to identify ways\r\nand means to face the phenomenon of globalization,\r\nwith its consequences and economic and social\r\nrepercussions, and to adapt to it in order to ensure that\r\nits dividends are shared and to spare our peoples,\r\nespecially peoples of the South, the negative fallout\r\nfrom it.\r\nThe African continent is a region suffering most\r\nfrom development problems, despite major reforms\r\nundertaken by the countries of the continent in\r\ndifferent areas. Despite the efforts made by certain\r\nAfrican countries, Africa is still suffering from a severe\r\nlack of resources and assistance which prevents it from\r\njoining the global development process. In this context,\r\none of the greatest challenges is to prevent the\r\nmarginalization of the economies of developing\r\ncountries and to ensure an international environment\r\nconducive to access to international markets and to an\r\nincreased share of international trade. This will require\r\nthe international community to provide the necessary\r\nimpetus in the area of investment and financing if these\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nStates are to develop, and to increase official\r\ndevelopment assistance, which has not only remained\r\nbelow 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of the\r\ncountries of the North, but is actually decreasing, while\r\nthe external debt crisis and debt servicing continue to\r\nburden developing countries.\r\nIn this context, we recall the initiative of\r\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, calling for the\r\nrecycling of debts in development projects, which\r\nwould make it possible to reduce the debt burden and\r\nhelp the countries concerned.\r\nI also take this opportunity to recall the appeal\r\nmade by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 1995 for\r\nthe creation of a partnership and development contract\r\nbetween the countries of the south and north shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean. This appeal is an extension of\r\nPresident Ben Ali’s initiative, launched in 1989 from\r\nthis lofty rostrum, for a global contract of peace and\r\nprogress between the countries of the North and South\r\naimed at strengthening cooperation and creating new\r\nprospects for stability and progress in the world.\r\nGiven the major progress achieved in the\r\nscientific and technological spheres in recent decades,\r\nthe millennium on which we are embarking will\r\nundoubtedly be one of science, technology and\r\ncommunications, necessitating the sharing of the\r\nbenefits of progress, including in the field of\r\ncomputers, which will create great prospects for the\r\nharmonious and balanced development of countries.\r\nIn this context, I recall Tunisia’s initiative to hold\r\na world summit on the information society, and its\r\nproposal, in the framework of the International\r\nTelecommunication Union, to host such a summit in\r\n2003. I renew my appeal to all Member States and to\r\nthe parties and institutions interested in this field to\r\nsupport this initiative and contribute as much as\r\npossible to organizing the summit in Tunisia.\r\nPeace and security are part of a concept with\r\ncomplementary dimensions; it is no longer limited to\r\nthe outbreak, management and resolution of conflicts,\r\nbut, rather, encompasses everything that contributes to\r\nstrengthening stability and offers opportunities for\r\ndevelopment and prosperity. Furthermore, exclusion\r\nand marginalization, in all their aspects, undoubtedly\r\nlead to extremism and open the way to tension and\r\nviolence. We know today that the struggle against\r\npoverty has assumed considerable importance. Indeed,\r\nwhile many societies enjoy well-being and prosperity,\r\nlarge fringes of the world’s population experience\r\npoverty and destitution, which are alien to moral values\r\nand human rights. Furthermore, abject poverty is one\r\nof the most dangerous sources of conflict and\r\ninstability. The fight against this planetary scourge and\r\nthe violence and internal and inter-State conflicts that it\r\nengenders is a universal duty and a moral obligation\r\nthat all international parties must assume.\r\nIn this context, I wish to reiterate the appeal\r\nlaunched by His Excellency President Zine El Abidine\r\nBen Ali for the creation of a world solidarity fund, as\r\nan instrument to complement existing international\r\nmechanisms, without replacing them. This fund could\r\nbe financed by donations and voluntary assistance from\r\nthe international community, and its objective would be\r\nto finance field programmes to fight poverty directly\r\nand urgently.\r\nPresident Ben Ali has made this proposal based\r\non the success of the experience of the National\r\nSolidarity Fund, 26.26, set up in Tunisia in 1992,\r\nwhich helped lower the rate of poverty in our country\r\nfrom 22 per cent to 6 per cent. This proposal has been\r\nfavourably received by member countries of the region\r\nand France, as well as by 12 international and regional\r\norganizations, such as the Group of 77, the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, the South Summit and the General\r\nAssembly special session on social development. With\r\nthe international community’s awareness of the need to\r\nfight poverty, and given the wide support that the\r\nproposal to create a world solidarity fund enjoys,\r\nTunisia would like to present, during the current\r\nsession, a draft resolution in this regard, which it hopes\r\nwill obtain all the support necessary from Member\r\nStates.\r\nTunisia has always attached great importance to\r\ndemocracy and good governance, because it is\r\nconvinced that these values are an integral part of any\r\nrebirth and development. Since the change of 7\r\nNovember 1987, we have introduced fundamental\r\nreforms to promote these values. Indeed, the principles\r\nof human rights, the culture of tolerance and respect for\r\nthe right to difference are the bases of change in\r\nTunisia, which has enriched the values of international\r\nsolidarity and collective responsibility at all levels:\r\npolitical, economic and social.\r\nThe existence of a national solidarity fund is the\r\nbest reflection of the importance of this aspect in\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nnational life. An individual’s awareness of his\r\nresponsibility towards the future of his homeland\r\nimplies solidarity and cooperation with all components\r\nof society, making it possible to remedy the problems\r\nof exclusion and marginalization in society.\r\nDemocracy, human rights, good governance and\r\nnational solidarity are interlinked values that must take\r\ninto account the characteristics and specific features of\r\neach society, since there is no standard model that can\r\nbe applied to everyone everywhere. This vision, which\r\nhas been enshrined at various international forums\r\nwould, thanks to the positive results seen in different\r\ncountries, including Tunisia, be likely to constitute one\r\nof the main concepts we have been called upon to\r\nadopt consensually and to implement in the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nIndeed, the right of peoples to freedom and\r\ndemocracy is a concept that has become a daily\r\npractice in many countries and must be consolidated,\r\ntaking into account the requirements of growth and\r\nprogress that themselves constitute a fundamental\r\ncondition for peace and stability. In this context,\r\ninternational partnership is a common denominator that\r\nmust guide our action in the next millennium.\r\nFinally, allow me to express the hope that this\r\nsession will mark the rebirth of solidarity among all\r\ncomponents of the international community, within\r\nwhich the United Nations will play a leading role\r\nthrough its outreach and its ongoing harmonious\r\nactions. Our objective would be that our action should\r\ncontain a human global dimension to establish a\r\ncommon strategy and conditions for security, stability,\r\ndevelopment and prosperity on the basis of the\r\ncommon interests of all peoples everywhere.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Lila Ratsifandrihamanana, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Madagascar.\r\nMrs. Ratsifandrihamanana (Madagascar)\r\n(spoke in French): I join all those who have welcomed\r\nthe start of this fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Endorsing the Millennium Declaration of\r\nthe Millennium Summit, I reiterate its message: Let\r\nus — the peoples of the United Nations, faced with\r\nnew challenges; brothers and sisters, partners linked by\r\nand in our support for the principles of our\r\nOrganization; with the expectations and constraints of\r\nour countries and peoples, yearning for peace and well-\r\nbeing; likewise facing the requirements of\r\nglobalization and the manifold risks of conflict and\r\nmarginalization — be united in our action; let us say:\r\n“We the peoples”, inspired by new hope and new\r\nmomentum, are for a better millennium.\r\nThe delegation of Madagascar congratulates you,\r\nMr. President, on your unanimous election to preside\r\nover the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, a\r\ntribute both to your eminent diplomatic qualities and to\r\nyour country, Finland.\r\nWe also pay tribute to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the\r\ndedication and determination he displayed in presiding\r\nover the fifty-fourth session.\r\nWe convey our congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his efforts he has made. His actions will\r\nbenefit all the citizens of the world, who are all anxious\r\nto leave deprivation and poverty behind.\r\nI also take this opportunity to thank, from this\r\nrostrum, the United Nations, for having adopted\r\nresolution 54/96 M of 14 March 2000, as well as all the\r\ncountries and organizations that helped Madagascar\r\nfollowing the cyclone damage at the beginning of this\r\nyear.\r\nWith regard to restructuring the United Nations, it\r\nis high time to enact such proposals as enlarging that\r\ncornerstone of collective peace that is the Security\r\nCouncil, streamlining the institutional structure to\r\nmake it work better, and improving the financial\r\nstructure with a view to a more equitable assessment of\r\ncontributions. The power of the veto, which in itself\r\nconstitutes a nullification of democracy, is\r\nincompatible with the founding principles of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe know that, unfortunately, Africa is a place of\r\nperpetual conflict, but a new impetus is manifesting\r\nitself in the search for lasting peace and reconciliation.\r\nWith regard to the crisis in Comoros, Madagascar\r\nrespects the position expressed by the Organization for\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) at its thirty-sixth Assembly of\r\nHeads of State and Government, held at Lomé. The\r\nAntananarivo Agreement of April 1999 remains the\r\nviable solution for bringing to an end the separatist\r\ncrisis in Anjouan, a crisis that was caused by the\r\nunconstitutionality of the regime currently in power.\r\nMadagascar welcomes the efforts undertaken in\r\nBurundi by President Nelson Mandela in his capacity\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nas mediator and facilitator. Those efforts led to the\r\nsigning of the Arusha agreement, which we hope will\r\nallow the people of Burundi to be united once again\r\nand to find peace and a new impetus for development.\r\nMadagascar has long supported the struggle for\r\nself-determination of the Sahraoui people and\r\nencourages the implementation of the United Nations\r\nSettlement Plan as the only viable mechanism able to\r\nresolve the differences between the two parties.\r\nWe welcome the outcome of the mediation efforts\r\nundertaken by President Ismail Omar Guelleh of the\r\nRepublic of Djibouti. Thanks to those efforts, Somalia\r\nis now beginning to find peace after more than a\r\ndecade as a non-State. The election by the parliament\r\nin Djibouti on 25 August 2000 of Mr. Abdikassim\r\nSalad Hassan as the new President is a step towards\r\nagreement. The people of Somalia can now embark\r\nupon the process of restoring a State of law and civil\r\npeace through their own efforts and with the support of\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe desire in recent months for dialogue between\r\nthe two Koreas is encouraging. We welcome the\r\nsummit conference held in Pyongyang in June 2000 to\r\ndiscuss peaceful reunification that led to the signing of\r\na joint North-South declaration. The family reunions\r\nthat took place after half a century of separation were\r\nmoving, and such meetings should be facilitated in the\r\nfuture. The decision to have the athletes of the North\r\nand South march together at the Olympic Games in\r\nSydney reflects a desire for reconciliation.\r\nMadagascar is a peaceful island in the Indian\r\nOcean. Through me, my country reiterates its\r\ncommitment to carrying out disarmament. We are\r\ncounting on the implementation of the conventions\r\nprohibiting the production, proliferation and illicit\r\nsales of weapons of all kinds. On 25 August 1999,\r\nMadagascar ratified the Convention on the Prohibition\r\nof the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of\r\nAnti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\r\nFurthermore, our Parliament’s ratification process for\r\nthe Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons has\r\nbegun.\r\nThe proliferation of light weapons is one of the\r\ncauses of the spread of conflict. My country therefore\r\nfully supports the convening in 2001 of an international\r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations on\r\nthe illicit trafficking in light weapons in all its aspects.\r\nWe pay tribute to the United Nations peace\r\nvolunteers who were victims of the recent terrorist act\r\nof aggression in West Timor. We underscore the need\r\nfor a joint strategy to deal with the current wave of\r\nviolence. Thus on 1 October 1999, Madagascar signed\r\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings. We look forward to a speedy\r\nconclusion of the draft convention for the suppression\r\nof acts of nuclear terrorism.\r\nMadagascar strongly supports the\r\nrecommendations of the Brahimi report and looks\r\nforward to their effective and speedy implementation\r\nso as to strengthen the peacekeeping capacity of our\r\nOrganization. We should stress the training, equipping\r\nand safety of peace volunteers. In this connection, the\r\ncountries concerned and neighbouring States should\r\nmake their contributions. Adopting a comprehensive\r\napproach to conflict prevention is necessary because\r\nthe problem needs to be tackled at the source.\r\nBecause we support democracy and the\r\nobservance of human rights and the rights of citizens,\r\nMadagascar joined in the decision taken at Algiers in\r\n1999 during the thirty-fifth OAU Assembly of Heads\r\nof State and Government to condemn the taking of\r\npower through unconstitutional means. A resolution of\r\nthe thirty-sixth Assembly, which was held at Lomé,\r\nurges the international community to condemn with\r\none voice such anti-democratic practices and to enact\r\nsanctions against regimes that result from such\r\npractices.\r\nIn the new millennium, let us ensure that children\r\nremain at the heart of our collective efforts. The\r\ntwenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly,\r\non social development, held in June 2000 at Geneva,\r\nemphasized the need to protect children, to inform\r\nthem of their rights and to educate them fully in order\r\nto prepare them for citizenship.\r\nIn order to mark the Millennium Summit, on 7\r\nSeptember 2000, Madagascar signed Optional\r\nProtocols: one to the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild, on the involvement of children in armed\r\nconflict, and another to the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen. Gender equality is for us an ongoing\r\nchallenge.\r\nWe condemn anything that runs counter to the\r\nprogress of human beings, and we endorse the common\r\nstruggle against social scourges and transnational\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\ncrime. We also wish to draw attention to the upsurge in\r\nsuch new areas of concern as sex tourism, paedophilia\r\nand the spread of HIV/AIDS. Moreover, together with\r\nmy sister Ministers for Social Affairs, we spoke out in\r\nfavour of a united struggle against those scourges in a\r\nletter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\r\nWhat Africa needs is easier access to care and\r\nmedications. Without opposing in any way the noble\r\nprinciple of freedom of thought and expression, we\r\ndeplore the ill effects of any type of physical or moral\r\naggression that is the result of the proliferation of cults,\r\nand media representations of obscene and immoral\r\nimages. In this regard, legal instruments should be\r\ndesigned and implemented to create parameters for the\r\nelectronic dissemination of material that poses a threat\r\nto morality.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe signing by Madagascar on 7 September last\r\nof the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child on the sale of children, child\r\nprostitution and child pornography attests to our\r\ndetermination to work to safeguard the family unit and\r\nfamily values, which are a source of human dignity and\r\nwhich guarantee stable sustainable social development.\r\nIn this context, Madagascar adopted a law in 1999\r\nwhich outlaws paedophilia.\r\nMadagascar has also involved itself in the various\r\nstages of the negotiations that led to the adoption and\r\nthe signing, on 14 September 2000, of the Protocol on\r\nBiosafety, the objective of which is to avert the dangers\r\nof using genetically modified substances. Madagascar\r\nis also against any use of the research relating to the\r\ncloning of human beings.\r\nThe economic and social difficulties facing my\r\ncountry are made worse by the uncertainty and changes\r\nin the international system. We must therefore\r\nstrengthen international dialogue on the basis of\r\npartnership and shared responsibility. We are\r\nconvinced that the promotion of a culture of peace and\r\nof mutual understanding will help bring about a\r\nharmonious world. Accordingly, Madagascar supports\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 53/22, which proclaimed\r\n2001 the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations.\r\nWe hope that this session will outline strategies\r\nthat are consonant with the requirements of\r\ndevelopment and of human security, in keeping with\r\nthe plan of action proposed by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report.\r\nAn overall rethinking of development is\r\nnecessary, because it is in everyone’s interests to\r\nincrease the purchasing power of the developing\r\ncountries, so that in the near future they can become\r\nequal partners as well as a potential market. We\r\ndeplore the glaring inequalities that exist today: our\r\npeoples are suffering from famine and malnutrition,\r\nwhereas some others are enjoying amazing\r\noverproduction. This imbalance does nothing to\r\npromote commercial and financial flows. We therefore\r\nsupport the Millennium Summit Declaration, which\r\nproposes the adoption of a duty-free admission policy\r\nfor products exported by the developing countries, an\r\nincrease in official development assistance, and the\r\nimplementation of a debt relief and forgiveness\r\nprogramme.\r\nThe holding in May 2001 of the third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries\r\nshould lead to decisions that ultimately will help to\r\neliminate the least-developed-country category from\r\nthe scale of world economic values.\r\nAccordingly, we support the principles of self-\r\nconfidence and of mutual trust in the establishment of a\r\nmonetary fund — a development fund — and a\r\ncommodity price stabilization fund. This initiative\r\nseeks to both reduce the vulnerability of the developing\r\ncountries to exogenous factors and to decrease the\r\ndependence of our economies on those of the\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nConcerning Africa specifically, regional and\r\ncontinental integration is vital in order to avoid\r\nmarginalization. In this respect, Madagascar signed the\r\ndraft Charter of the African Union, which is the\r\nexpression of the rebirth of a responsible, sovereign\r\nAfrica.\r\nImportant meetings await us in 2001, including\r\nthe high-level intergovernmental meeting on financing\r\nfor development and the special session to follow up on\r\nthe World Summit for Children, which are all\r\nopportunities to give real meaning to the commitments\r\nundertaken during this Millennium Assembly.\r\nWe have come to this historic session convinced\r\nthat it will breathe new life into our Organization and\r\nprovide the basis for a dynamic for peace and\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\ncooperation. We have come here because we have\r\nconfidence in concerted action to meet today’s\r\nchallenges. We have come here because we have hope\r\nin a viable future free from need in a world of well-\r\nbeing and peace.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I give\r\nthe floor to The Honourable Lilian Patel, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of\r\nMalawi.\r\nMrs. Patel (Malawi): At the outset, allow me to\r\njoin other speakers in congratulating Mr. Harri Holkeri\r\non his election to preside over the Millennium\r\nAssembly. I am confident that under his able\r\nstewardship we the peoples, and particularly those of\r\nus from the developing countries, can look forward\r\nwith optimism to a highly proactive session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. His election to the presidency is a\r\nclear reflection of the confidence which the\r\ninternational community has in his great country,\r\nFinland. He can count on the continued support and\r\ncooperation of the Malawi delegation in this\r\nmomentous task.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Namibia, for his highly successful\r\npresidency of the fifty-fourth session.\r\nLess than a fortnight ago, our leaders gathered at\r\nthis very venue to map out the way forward in this\r\nmillennium. The enthusiasm with which the\r\ndeliberations were conducted culminated in a highly\r\ninspiring outcome document, which gives a clear\r\noutline of what needs to be done.\r\nMalawi welcomes the outcome of the Millennium\r\nSummit. At the same time, we recognize that the\r\nstrategic partnership required for the implementation of\r\nthe outcome document calls for the political\r\ncommitment of the international community. It is\r\ntherefore our hope that the enthusiasm with which the\r\nworld leaders approached the Millennium Summit will\r\ntranslate into genuine political will in the\r\nimplementation of the measures that were adopted.\r\nLet us all build on the consensus that emerged\r\nfrom the Millennium Summit. Recognition by world\r\nleaders of the urgent need to address issues bedevilling\r\nhumanity today is the first step towards building a\r\nprosperous and better tomorrow.\r\nA multiplicity of factors are constraining the\r\nefforts of the developing countries towards achieving\r\neconomic development. There is therefore a need for a\r\nmultidimensional approach in order to address the\r\nplight of these countries. Such efforts must, of\r\nnecessity, be pursued at both the national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nNot long ago, Malawi joined other members of\r\nthe international community in welcoming the process\r\nof globalization. We joined the chorus in\r\nacknowledging the inevitability of the march towards a\r\nglobal village. In our enthusiasm, we looked forward to\r\nmeeting the challenges and taking advantage of the\r\nopportunities that globalization was envisaged to offer.\r\nToday, the experience has proved daunting. A number\r\nof constraints dog our march towards the global\r\nvillage.\r\nAlong with other sub-Saharan African countries,\r\nMalawi has yet to meaningfully enjoy the benefits of\r\nmodern information technology. We all know that the\r\nprocess of globalization is centred on the swift and\r\naccurate flow of information. The interconnectedness\r\nwhich information technology brings about offers the\r\nbenefits of choice. Those who possess the\r\ntechnological capacity are, hence, ahead of the rest in\r\nthe march towards the global village.\r\nMalawi therefore calls upon the donor community\r\nto level the playing field by assisting those who lack\r\nthe capacity to meaningfully take advantage of a\r\nmodern global information network. There is need to\r\nclose the existing digital divide.\r\nInternational trade is critical if the economies of\r\nmost developing countries are to thrive. Malawi’s\r\nexport-oriented economy is, in this regard, no\r\nexception. With no mineral wealth of significance, our\r\neconomy depends almost solely on the export of\r\nprimary agricultural products and the importation of\r\nmanufactured goods. The steadily deteriorating barter\r\nterms of trade for the primary products has long been a\r\nsource of concern to us. As if this were not daunting\r\nenough, the situation is compounded by the imposition\r\nof protectionist measures by countries that offer\r\nmarkets for our exports. A range of non-tariff barriers\r\nis being subtly put in place, rendering it difficult for\r\nour products to reach those markets. These\r\nprotectionist measures run counter to the spirit of free\r\ntrade which we all profess and which we all believe to\r\nbe necessary for the growing interdependence among\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\ncountries. As long as barriers to free trade among\r\ncountries are erected, global integration will face a\r\nserious setback.\r\nMalawi therefore calls upon the development\r\npartners to open up their markets to products from the\r\ndeveloping countries. Increased market access is one\r\nway in which a country like Malawi could be\r\nempowered to meaningfully participate in the\r\nglobalization process.\r\nTime and again, we in the developing countries\r\nhave expressed serious concern over the existing\r\nproblem of external debt. Debt servicing has compelled\r\nour Governments to divert meagre resources from\r\ndevelopment programmes. As a result, basic social\r\nservices and investment in other infrastructure\r\nprogrammes suffer.\r\nWe welcome initiatives adopted by the\r\ndevelopment partners to address the problem of debt.\r\nThe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative is, among other measures, notable. We all\r\nlooked forward with hope to the recent G-8 Summit\r\nheld in Okinawa, Japan. However, the lack of\r\ncommitment to deal with the problem of debt\r\ndecisively means that the burden still remains virtually\r\nintact.\r\nMalawi therefore believes that the only way in\r\nwhich the problem of external debt can meaningfully\r\nbe addressed is through outright cancellation. We invite\r\nour development partners to exercise the political will\r\nfor debt cancellation. We need to free resources for\r\ninvestment in basic infrastructural services.\r\nOfficial development assistance and foreign\r\ndirect investment are necessary if developing\r\neconomies like Malawi’s are to develop. It is largely in\r\nrecognition of this reality that the United Nations set\r\nthe target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product\r\nof developed countries for official development\r\nassistance. The general decline in official development\r\nassistance flows to the developing countries therefore\r\nruns counter to the internationally recognized target.\r\nWe therefore pay tribute to those development partners\r\nwho have either met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent\r\ntarget. At the same time, we call upon those falling\r\nshort of it to live up to the expectations of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMalawi welcomes the trend towards a rise in\r\nforeign direct investment over the past few years.\r\nHowever, we observe that, in spite of the steady rise,\r\nthe distribution itself has been uneven, with sub-\r\nSaharan Africa making no meaningful gains. We hope\r\nthat efforts will be made to address the disparity.\r\nJust over 10 years ago, the Berlin Wall came\r\ntumbling down in a highly symbolic move marking the\r\ndemise of the cold war. All peace-loving people in the\r\nworld who wanted humankind to live in dignity\r\nwelcomed that momentous development. The concept\r\nof “peace dividend” gained currency as the\r\ninternational community welcomed the opportunity to\r\nturn swords into plowshares.\r\nToday’s reality has not borne out our\r\nexpectations. Trouble spots, both long-standing and\r\nemerging ones, dot the globe. During the cold war, we\r\nblamed conflicts on super-Power rivalry. Yet conflicts\r\ntoday have assumed different dimensions, and they\r\ncontinue to divert meagre national resources away from\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nThe protracted civil war in Angola, civil strife in\r\nSierra Leone, the Great Lakes region of Africa, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Kosovo and\r\nCentral Asia, among other areas, perhaps reveal causal\r\nfactors that we glossed over during the cold war. Greed\r\namong politicians and the ruthless pursuit of profit by\r\nmultinational corporations have, in a number of cases,\r\ncoalesced to prolong conflict. We have all noted the\r\nrole that a precious mineral like diamonds can play in\r\nunleashing human tragedy.\r\nMalawi welcomes the recent adoption by the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council of a resolution that\r\naims at regulating the trade in diamonds, especially\r\nthose acquired illegally. The international community\r\ncan count on our unflinching cooperation in the\r\nimplementation of the resolution.\r\nWe have also noted the untiring efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. However, the lessons of the United\r\nNations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, and\r\nindeed elsewhere, clearly point to the need for a serious\r\nreview of the mandate of such missions. The\r\nembarrassment that the peacemakers were subjected to\r\nis something that, we believe, must not be allowed to\r\nhappen again. In this regard, my delegation welcomes\r\nthe recommendations made in the Brahimi Report.\r\nWe, at the same time, join the international\r\ncommunity in condemning the recent murder of three\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nUnited Nations relief workers in West Timor. We call\r\non those responsible to desist from further interfering\r\nwith the safety and freedom of refugees and\r\nhumanitarian workers in the region.\r\nMalawi recognizes that the United Nations alone\r\ncannot provide miracle solutions to conflicts that rage\r\nin the various regions. It is largely incumbent upon the\r\nprimary players to exercise political maturity and\r\nrestrain their passions.\r\nWe note that in most conflict areas, there exist\r\nnegotiated frameworks for resolution of the\r\ndifferences. And yet, the sheer lack of political\r\ncommitment has led the parties to wantonly renege on\r\nagreements that they so painstakingly negotiated. We\r\ntherefore call upon all warring parties to respect\r\nexisting peace agreements and pool their efforts\r\ntowards nation-building.\r\nThe Government of Malawi welcomes efforts by\r\nthe United Nations to rid the globe of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\n(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) represent some of the notable efforts by the\r\ninternational community to bring about lasting global\r\npeace and security. Malawi would like to express its\r\nreadiness to join the international community in the\r\nadoption of measures that seek to advance the cause of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe waste meagre resources to keep conflict\r\ngoing, while in the process sacrificing the welfare of\r\nour people. His Excellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi, time and again\r\ndecried this, saying that we, especially in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, are too poor to divert meagre resources to\r\nsustain conflict.\r\nThe above factors present a front which impedes\r\neconomic development in the developing countries,\r\nespecially the least developed among them. Investment\r\nin basic infrastructure suffers as a result of, directly or\r\notherwise, an interplay of these forces.\r\nAs long as the international community holds\r\nback the political will needed for decisive action, the\r\nplaying field will remain uneven. As such, the\r\ndeveloping countries will continue to be marginalized\r\nin the march towards the global village.\r\nMy delegation does not intend to heap all blame\r\non international factors alone. At the national level, we\r\nin the developing countries have to take stock of our\r\ndomestic policies. Malawi, for one, is doing its part in\r\nthis regard. The democratic governance which the\r\nruling United Democratic Front (UDF) ushered in the\r\ncountry in June 1994 is well on course. The people’s\r\nconfidence in the UDF-led government was manifested\r\nwhen they re-elected it in the June 1999 general\r\nelections. In the seven years of its existence, the\r\nGovernment has put in place institutional mechanisms\r\naimed at promoting human rights and other freedoms\r\nthat form the core of good governance.\r\nMalawi’s commitment to the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy is now irreversible. In November this year,\r\nthe country will take yet another step forward with the\r\nconduct of local government elections. We fully\r\nrecognize the contribution which good governance\r\nmakes to economic development in a country.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the\r\nUnited Nations and those development partners who\r\nhave contributed to our effort towards the promotion of\r\ngood governance. As the process goes on, we shall\r\ncount on your continued assistance.\r\nWe in Malawi further recognize the central role\r\nthat a vibrant private sector plays in economic\r\ndevelopment. For long, the previous government in\r\nMalawi neglected the private sector, opting, instead, to\r\nboost parastatal enterprises.\r\nThe new political dispensation has opened up the\r\ncountry to a competitive, free market economy.\r\nInefficient parastatal organizations are falling into\r\nprivate ownership through a privatization programme.\r\nAlready, there are discernible benefits accruing, most\r\nnotably marked improvements in the quality of\r\nproducts and services on the domestic market.\r\nThe existing political stability and the general\r\nwarmth of the friendly people of Malawi create an\r\ninviting climate to the foreign investor. The\r\nGovernment has, in addition, adopted measures which\r\nare aimed at creating a conducive investment\r\nenvironment. We, therefore, welcome entrepreneurs to\r\ncome and sample the market.\r\nAt the core of Malawi’s fight against poverty is\r\nthe Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP) which the\r\nUDF-led Government launched upon its assumption of\r\noffice. Within the context of the programme, the\r\nGovernment later launched the Malawi Social Action\r\nFund (MASAF), a bottom-up framework that involves\r\nthe villager in taking decisions on development\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nprogrammes. MASAF is making the difference in the\r\nlives of the citizenry. The face of infrastructure in the\r\ncountryside, where nearly 80 per cent of the country’s\r\npopulation resides, has been considerably transformed.\r\nWe, therefore, thank the World Bank for the\r\nsupport it is extending to the Malawi Social Action\r\nFund, which is currently in its second phase.\r\nAmong other strategies, Malawi has adopted\r\nmeasures aimed at empowering vulnerable groups in\r\nsociety. A systematic programme aimed at empowering\r\nwomen through micro-credit and improved access to\r\neducation for girls are some of these. A few years ago,\r\nthe Government established the Ministry of State in the\r\nPresident’s Office Responsible for Persons with\r\nDisabilities, whose impact is beginning to show.\r\nOur determined efforts to rid the country of\r\nexcruciating poverty are impeded by the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. In the last decade, the extent of devastation\r\ncaused by the pandemic in Malawi has been\r\nfrightening. By targeting the productive age bracket of\r\nthe population, HIV/AIDS has clearly begun to reverse\r\nthe hard-won gains that the nation had made towards\r\nthe close of the last decade.\r\nAt the same time, we are aware of the advances\r\nthat the West has to date made in the treatment of\r\nHIV/AIDS. The prohibitive cost of the drugs precludes\r\ndeveloping countries like Malawi from gaining access\r\nto them. And yet, these are the countries that are in the\r\ngreatest need of such therapy, in view of their high\r\nincidence of HIV/AIDS.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the effort of the United\r\nNations, through the Joint United Nations Programme\r\non HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), to deal with the pandemic.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the Security Council gave\r\ncentre stage to HIV/AIDS issues early this year. We\r\nbelieve that the devastation left by the scourge deserves\r\na high international profile. Malawi further calls on\r\nthose countries with the capacity to make the necessary\r\narrangements to render the drugs affordable for all\r\nthose who need them.\r\nIt is clear that if the international community is to\r\nforge the strategic partnership needed for a smooth\r\nmarch towards the global village, we need to level the\r\nplaying field. This calls for political will on the part of\r\nall of us. We need to fulfil our shared responsibilities\r\nfor the benefit of humankind.\r\nMalawi welcomes the recent admission of Tuvalu\r\nas the 189th Member State of the United Nations. On\r\nbehalf of my Government and the people of Malawi, I\r\nextend our support and best wishes to the Government\r\nand the people of Tuvalu.\r\nTime and again, Malawi has spoken in favour of\r\ngranting the Republic of China on Taiwan the role that\r\nit deserves in the international community. The hard-\r\nworking and peace-loving people of Taiwan have\r\nclearly demonstrated that they are ready to actively\r\ncontribute to the goals and ideals for which the United\r\nNations stands.\r\nWe therefore appeal to the Organization’s\r\nmembership to look beyond narrow political\r\nconsiderations and face the geopolitical realities that\r\nobtain on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The\r\ncontinued isolation of Taiwan does not bode well for\r\nthe spirit of globalization, which we all acknowledge,\r\nhas to be all-inclusive.\r\nFinally, allow me to reaffirm the commitment of\r\nthe Government of the Republic of Malawi to live up to\r\nthe obligations enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. This is the only universal body that is well\r\nplaced to take us all into the millennium.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency The Honourable\r\nLakshman Kadirgamar, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSri Lanka.\r\nMr. Kadirgamar (Sri Lanka): I convey to the\r\nPresident the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on his\r\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, and I pledge to him\r\nSri Lanka’s fullest cooperation and support in his work.\r\nTo the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo-\r\nBen Gurirab, I convey Sri Lanka’s appreciation and\r\nadmiration for the masterly manner in which he served\r\nas President of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nwelcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hope\r\nthat its dreams and hopes for a better world will never\r\nfade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. The\r\nPresident of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike\r\nKumaratunga, unable to attend the Summit, conveyed,\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nthrough a message I had the honour to read out to the\r\nSummit, her hopes and her vision for the future of\r\nhumanity. Her words were these:\r\n“Peace among all States and peace among\r\nall peoples within States so that all, and not only\r\nsome, may in safety, without fear, in dignity,\r\nwithout humiliation, in good health, and in\r\nmaterial and spiritual well-being enjoy the\r\nwonders of life on this miracle we call the planet\r\nEarth.” (A/55/PV.7)\r\nTherefore, the President of Sri Lanka spoke, with\r\nemphasis, of the necessity of protecting and preserving,\r\nfor the future, those minimal and most fundamental\r\ncertainties that the Member States of the United\r\nNations have been able to establish — in particular, to\r\npreserve what was and continues to be the\r\nOrganization’s very foundation: the entity we know as\r\nthe State. She pointed out that it was in the General\r\nAssembly that representatives of Governments, of\r\npeoples and of States gather together under a Charter\r\nthat assures States of their sovereign equality, their\r\npolitical independence and their territorial integrity.\r\nThese are the fundamentals of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nAnd this is as it should be. States are the principal\r\norganizational entities into which the peoples of this\r\nplanet have gathered. The principal, overall\r\norganizational edifice of the international community is\r\nthe inter-States system.\r\nFor the entity we know as the State, there is no\r\nsubstitute. If States weaken, so will this Organization.\r\nIf States are diminished, so will this Organization be\r\ndiminished.\r\nThus, it was the plea of the President of Sri Lanka\r\nthat everything possible be done to protect and\r\npreserve, and not to decry or endeavour to erode, the\r\nstability and the well-being of the entity we know as\r\nthe State, for whose sovereignty, territorial integrity\r\nand political independence the Charter gave us its\r\nassurance.\r\nBefore proceeding any further I should make it\r\nclear — in view of recent statements on the part of\r\nspeakers of obvious goodwill and intentions, but with\r\nwhose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ —\r\nthat those who assert the necessity of continued\r\nreaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms of\r\nthe Charter must not be regarded — I repeat, must not\r\nbe regarded — as having in any way diminished their\r\ncommitment to the importance of universal adherence\r\nto human rights and all that is required for the dignity\r\nof the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the\r\npromotion and protection of the human rights of its\r\nown people and of all peoples everywhere.\r\nThere is, however, a substantial body of opinion,\r\nwithin which Sri Lanka includes itself, which is of the\r\nview that the way to proceed in the matter of human\r\nrights and the dignity of the individual is properly\r\nthrough continued and close cooperation between all\r\nStates, while respecting the sovereignty of each. The\r\nway of multilateralism or globalization, which appear\r\nexpressly or by implication to overlook or diminish the\r\nsovereignty of States, is not, to many of us in this Hall,\r\na commendable course. It is not a course whose\r\nworthiness in practice has as yet been established.\r\nIndeed, most endeavours to overlook or diminish the\r\nsovereignty of States have often had disastrous\r\nconsequences. With that initial clarification and a\r\nreminder that human rights are for the observance not\r\nonly of States, but non-State entities as well, I shall\r\nproceed with the remainder of my address.\r\nWe must bear in mind that the entities we know\r\nas States are national and international corporate\r\nentities of enormous complexity, differing in so many\r\nrespects from corporate entities of the private sector\r\nand, of course, differing as well from those\r\ninnumerable entities, in their thousands now, to which\r\nwe refer, broadly and benignly, but somewhat\r\nsimplistically, as civil society.\r\nIf the management of a developed State with\r\nmore than adequate resources at its command is a\r\ncomplex undertaking, how much more complex would\r\nbe the management of a developing State without such\r\nresources and such infrastructures? Then there are\r\nthose developing States such as Sri Lanka, with their\r\nmulti-ethnic, multireligious societies where the\r\nlegacies of centuries of a colonial past take more than\r\none generation to erase.\r\nAside from the pressures inherent in the very\r\nnature and history of a State, let us not forget the\r\nadditional external pressures a State is subject to —\r\neconomic, social and political, legitimate and\r\nillegitimate, civil and uncivil, and often criminal —\r\nthat the age of information and its consequences have\r\nbrought in their wake. These are external pressures that\r\nraise troubling uncertainties for many States and for\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\ndeveloping States in particular, that are without the\r\nblessings of abundant resources and advanced\r\ninfrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain the\r\nstructures of States and could come close to threatening\r\ntheir very existence.\r\nWhere the processes of globalization are\r\nexploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or the\r\nillegitimate or the criminal, one is reminded of the\r\nreport from the Secretariat received by this Assembly\r\nthree years ago which drew attention to the threat to\r\nGovernment authority and civil society, to law and\r\norder and to legitimate economic and political\r\ninstitutions posed by transnational networks of crime,\r\nnarcotics, money laundering and terrorism having\r\naccess to sophisticated information technologies and\r\nweaponry.\r\nOf course, where there is the use of internal\r\narmed force against a State, as in my country, the\r\ncomplexities within a State compound themselves\r\nmany times over; and we know that the use of armed\r\nforce against a State is the greatest threat of all to its\r\npreservation and well-being. This is particularly so in\r\ndemocracies, whose very openness makes them most\r\nvulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long-\r\nstanding and unwavering commitment to democratic\r\nfundamentals.\r\nPeace among States, the primary purpose of the\r\nCharter, has to a large extent been achieved, if not in\r\nfact in every case, at least in general, and in terms of\r\ngenerally observed rules of international law, under and\r\npursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use of\r\narmed force by one State against another State, except\r\nin self-defence or as authorized by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nYet when we turn to peace within States, and the\r\nuse of armed force against a State internally, we see an\r\nentirely different, and an often confusing and\r\nfrustrating, picture. Each armed conflict is unique; each\r\na creature of its own history; the nature of each\r\ndetermined by its own surroundings. There is no\r\nsimplicity of circumstance, no uniformity in scenario,\r\nno easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come in\r\nmany different forms.\r\nThe relatively clear-cut format of a United\r\nNations response to inter-State armed conflicts —\r\nmonitoring a truce and keeping the peace after an\r\nagreed cessation of hostilities — seems, for internal\r\narmed conflicts, inadequate or inapplicable.\r\nThe Charter does not prescribe how this\r\nOrganization should proceed in cases of internal armed\r\nconflicts, except for the wise admonition in Article 2,\r\nparagraph 7, which says,\r\n“Nothing contained in the present Charter\r\nshall authorize the United Nations to intervene in\r\nmatters which are essentially within the domestic\r\njurisdiction of any State.”\r\nIn view of the varieties, complexities and\r\nintricacies of internal armed conflicts, this\r\nOrganization appears to be without the necessary\r\nstructure, the knowledge, expertise, experience and\r\nresources — and often, it would seem — without the\r\nnecessary collective will.\r\nTo suggest that the United Nations should\r\nintervene in internal armed conflicts across the\r\nboard — a suggestion made, on occasion, by persons of\r\nobvious goodwill but with little knowledge of local\r\ncircumstances — is wishful thinking of the most\r\nsimplistic kind, and incorrect in the extreme.\r\nA proposition of such a nature ignores the\r\nfundamental premise, indeed the truism, articulated so\r\nimpressively to the Millennium Summit by the head of\r\nState of Algeria, President Bouteflika, in his\r\nsummation of the deliberations of round table four: that\r\na democracy, offering to all its peoples the fundamental\r\nnecessities of peaceful, all-inclusive political\r\nprocesses, simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of the\r\ndemocratically expressed will of the populace of a\r\nState, which an armed terroristic attack on a\r\ndemocratic State so obviously constitutes.\r\nAt a more practical level, where would this\r\nOrganization — woefully under-financed for the\r\nfulfilment of its development objectives, which billions\r\naround this world expectantly await — obtain the\r\nfurther resources for such far-flung interventions in\r\ninternal domestic crises.\r\nCharter provisions and United Nations practice\r\naffirm that a State may act in individual or collective\r\nself-defence should there be an armed attack across its\r\nfrontiers. Yet, against massive internal armed attack,\r\nthe abilities of most States — or at least the abilities of\r\nmost developing States — to react with equivalent\r\narmed force in self-defence, or in enforcement of the\r\nlaw of the land, or in the maintenance of law and order,\r\nare very limited. Traditional police services are\r\ninadequate in design, in training, in equipment and in\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nexperience. Few States have ready and affordable\r\naccess to the necessary information or intelligence.\r\nFew States are able to maintain military infrastructures\r\neffective against heavily armed guerrilla-type\r\nonslaughts and the horrors of terror.\r\nSuch has been the experience of my country. Sri\r\nLanka has for many years had within its territory an\r\narmed conflict that has complicated the lives of the\r\nentire population of the country. It is a conflict of an\r\nextraordinary nature. A very small group of armed\r\nfighters and supporters — numbering less than 15,000\r\npersons in total; schooled in and totally devoted to\r\nviolence; rejecting the processes of peaceful society\r\nand participatory governance; achieving, through the\r\npractice of systematic terror, national and international\r\nnotoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of such\r\nproblems as they may have through dialogue —\r\ncontinues, in defiance of law and order, in rebellion\r\nagainst the State to fight for the establishment of a\r\nseparate, monolingual, mono-ethnic State in our\r\nterritory.\r\nA democratic State, because of its openness, its\r\nlaws, traditions and practices and its commitment to\r\ntolerance and dissent, is especially vulnerable to the\r\ndeployment of force against it by any group within its\r\nboundaries. An internal armed challenge to any State\r\nanywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere.\r\nUnless all States, democratic States in particular, agree\r\nto come to the aid of a State in such peril, democracy\r\nitself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy will\r\nnot survive.\r\nWhen the security and integrity of one State is\r\nthreatened by an armed group within it, surely —\r\nespecially in these contemporary times, with the cold\r\nwar far behind us — it behoves all other States to deny\r\nthat armed group any encouragement, any succour, any\r\nsafe haven. Today, for the prosecution of terrorist\r\nactivities in one country, massive funds are raised with\r\nimpunity in other countries, often through knowing or\r\nunknowing front organizations or other entities that\r\nnow proliferate in many forms and in many countries,\r\nand often, sadly, in the guise of charitable groups or\r\ngroups ostensibly concerned with human rights or\r\nethnic, cultural or social matters.\r\nThe magnitude of the collection of funds abroad\r\nfor terrorist purposes, and the extensiveness of the\r\nreach of the international networks developed for that\r\npurpose, boggle the mind. Their receipts seem to\r\nexceed the receipts of many transnational\r\nconglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues come, of\r\ncourse, from the customary illegal trade in drugs, arms\r\nor other merchandise, including the smuggling of\r\nhumans.\r\nBut there also exists a far more abundant and\r\nseemingly limitless reservoir of funds — namely,\r\nexpatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As the\r\nwestern media has reported over the past few years\r\nfrom time to time, collections from expatriates abroad\r\nfor the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers, which\r\nis battling the Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering\r\nin their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a month\r\nfrom one country; $600,000 a month from another;\r\n$2.7 million a month from yet another; and large\r\nadditional funds from expatriates in still other\r\ncountries.\r\nIn 1988 an excellent study was published on\r\nfinancial havens, banking secrecy and money\r\nlaundering, a study by experts in the field,\r\ncommissioned by the United Nations Office for Drug\r\nControl and Crime Prevention. In order to implement\r\nadequately the provisions of the recently adopted\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, a study of a similar nature by\r\nUnited Nations bodies on the collection of external\r\nfunds for massive, continuous internal armed rebellion\r\nagainst a State, such as occurs in Sri Lanka, becomes\r\nespecially necessary when the armed group battling a\r\nState is in blatant violation of the human rights and\r\nhumanitarian norms and standards — including those\r\nrelating to children and to children in armed conflict —\r\nthat this Organization so correctly and so diligently\r\nespouses as the minimal contemporary requirements in\r\nhuman society.\r\nI proposed such a study at the fourth round table\r\nof the Millennium Summit, and that proposal was\r\nendorsed by our Chairman, President Bouteflika of\r\nAlgeria, in his summation to the General Assembly of\r\nthe proceedings of our round table. I urge that the\r\ninternational community give favourable consideration\r\nto that proposal.\r\nAs the years go by, and the armed conflict fuelled\r\nby such massive funds from abroad continues within a\r\nState, paradoxically, international perceptions seem to\r\nblur, not only among those in civil society, who are\r\noften uninformed, but even on the part of those in\r\npositions of international authority, within and outside\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nthis Organization, who should know better. The\r\nexistence of the internal armed conflict and the\r\nresulting casualties are bemoaned, and a cessation of\r\nhostilities is urged at any price, in seeming inattention\r\nto the fundamental fact that it is the armed internal\r\ngroup that is the aggressor and it is the State that is the\r\nvictim.\r\nSuch a blurring of international perceptions in\r\nsome quarters as to what the crucial facts are, is\r\ndistressing, and profoundly disappointing, to those,\r\nsuch as we in Sri Lanka, who have struggled hard, and\r\ncontinue to struggle hard, to preserve our democratic\r\nway of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic,\r\nmultireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance we\r\nwere once so blessed to enjoy.\r\nI hope that the thoughts that I have expressed\r\ntoday on the nature of the affairs of States, and of the\r\naffairs of developing States in the main, will show in\r\nsome measure why a sympathetic, rather than an\r\ninquisitorial, style is by far preferable in relation to the\r\naffairs of States, as in all human relationships.\r\nAt a more general level, I would like, before I\r\nmove on from this part of my statement, to refer to two\r\nother relevant questions: the role of the General\r\nAssembly and the role of civil society in the affairs of\r\nthe United Nations. The General Assembly is the only\r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations in which all\r\nMember States are represented, and the only principal\r\norgan whose terms of reference allow for consideration\r\nof any matter within the scope of the Charter.\r\nYet there is the perception among some that the\r\ncentre of gravity in decision-making on questions of\r\nmajor policy importance to the Organization appears to\r\nhave moved away from the General Assembly to an\r\nextent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatly\r\nwelcomes, therefore, the reaffirmation in paragraph 30\r\nof the Millennium Declaration of the central position of\r\nthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-\r\nmaking and representative organ of the United Nations,\r\nand the commitment of all nations to enable the\r\nGeneral Assembly to play that role effectively. The\r\npractical manner in which the General Assembly could\r\nplay that role will, of course, require very careful\r\nthought.\r\nThe ways in which “civil society”, and the\r\ninnumerable entities that that expression encompasses,\r\ncould best contribute to the work of the United\r\nNations — in terms of data collection, research and\r\nanalysis and expertise — in a manner that does not\r\nprejudice the role of States in the affairs of the United\r\nNations, will also require most careful examination.\r\nSuch contributions should be made in a manner that is\r\nnot partial or partisan, in favour of or against, but,\r\nrather, in a manner that befits an objective and neutral\r\nconsultant.\r\nMoreover, although civil society within a national\r\ncontext could be, and is, well accommodated in\r\ndomestic political processes, the manner in which civil\r\nsociety could be internationally accommodated within\r\nUnited Nations processes still remains a puzzle.\r\nAs in all human relationships, so also amongst\r\nStates: the strong do better than the weak, the rich\r\nbetter than the poor, the developed better than the\r\ndeveloping. This is the case most of all when times are\r\nhard. The marked decline in official development\r\nassistance, and the failure of most of the strong, the\r\nrich and the developed to meet their official\r\ndevelopment assistance pledges, show that for States,\r\nthere is no general safety net.\r\nIf there is one message from the Millennium\r\nSummit, and one that is now coming from this\r\nMillennium Assembly loud and clear, it is that\r\nglobalization may be a reality for all, but that it is that\r\nno panacea for all — certainly not for the developing\r\nworld. The benefits of globalization have by-passed\r\nmuch of the developing world. The poorest among us,\r\nspanning the continents of Africa, Central America and\r\nAsia, have experienced increasing marginalization.\r\nThere is little opportunity for developing countries to\r\nbe formative in the shaping of the world economy for\r\nthe future — in the deliberations that really matter.\r\nThus, although we are leaving the past century\r\nand the past millennium behind us, and celebrate their\r\npassing, more than half of humanity is still haunted by\r\nthe old, intractable economic and social tragedies that\r\nhave been with us since the dawn of time: poverty,\r\nilliteracy, ill health, hunger, unemployment, the\r\nproblems of the young, uncontrolled urbanization and\r\nthe growth of mega-cities.\r\nAmong these, poverty alleviation and poverty\r\nelimination remain for most of us in the developing\r\nworld the highest and, in fact, the only, meaningful\r\npriority. Poverty degrades humanity and, in an era of\r\nabundance and conspicuous consumption, visible in\r\nreal time across billions of television screens\r\nthroughout the world, undermines the very foundations\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nnecessary for the growth of humane societies and\r\nrefined governance.\r\nThe developing world needs to be accorded an\r\nadequate formative voice in the formulation of a new\r\ndevelopment chapter for the twenty-first century. Thus\r\nwe turn to the United Nations and, in ultimate recourse,\r\nas it were, to this General Assembly, under whose\r\nactive supervisory authority there must be a revival of\r\na comprehensive North-South development dialogue —\r\na dialogue that seems to be fading away.\r\nTo tell the countless starving and helpless\r\nmillions that a free global marketplace will show us the\r\nway is, I am sorry to say, simply not enough.\r\nResource deprivation over many generations and\r\nits debilitating consequences on adequate\r\ninfrastructural growth has severely damaged the\r\ncapacity of developing countries to cope with the\r\nmodern world.\r\nA new development chapter must provide for the\r\ncatastrophic negative contingencies, be they “man-\r\nmade” or otherwise, including such occurrences as the\r\npresent surge in the price of oil to the highest levels in\r\na decade that now place crushing burdens on the\r\nnational economies of developing countries struggling\r\ndesperately to contend with economic realities. They,\r\nlike Sri Lanka, can only hope and pray that the oil-\r\nproducing countries, which are certainly not insensitive\r\nto the plight of the developing world, will find it\r\npossible in some way to relieve such pressures in the\r\nvery near future.\r\nI should also wish at this juncture in my address\r\nto say a word about the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) of the seven States of\r\nSouth Asia — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives,\r\nNepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — a body which is\r\ndeeply committed to the advancement of the economic\r\nand social well-being of our peoples, numbering now\r\nin the region of 1.25 billion, not merely through\r\nnational endeavour, but through regional and\r\ninternational cooperation. Sri Lanka, as the current\r\nChair of SAARC, is seeking to implement the\r\nprogramme of activities laid down at the 1991\r\nColombo summit as best it can in difficult\r\ncircumstances. The people of our region are deeply\r\ncommitted to the goals of SAARC. They continue to\r\ninteract vigorously on a wide range of professional,\r\ncultural, educational and social activities,\r\nnotwithstanding the temporary setback to high-level\r\npolitical involvement that SAARC has suffered at this\r\ntime. We in SAARC are confident that it will not be\r\nlong before our movement is again able to play its full\r\nrole in the welfare of our peoples.\r\nI have just returned to New York from the\r\nInternational Conference on War-Affected Children,\r\norganized so successfully by the Government of\r\nCanada and held at Winnipeg.\r\nI cannot conclude my address to the General\r\nAssembly this year without making at least a brief\r\nreference to the abominable crimes that are being\r\ncommitted against young Tamil children in Sri Lanka\r\nby the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers. They\r\nhave been, and are, forcibly conscripting even 10-year-\r\nold children, boys and girls, for battle against the Sri\r\nLankan Army. Some of these children have been\r\nprogrammed into suicide bombers. They are forced to\r\nwear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite on\r\nthem to evade capture. This wretched practice\r\ncontinues unabated.\r\nIn 1998, at the invitation of my Government, the\r\nSecretary-General’s Special Representative for\r\nChildren and Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu,\r\nvisited Sri Lanka and met some of the Tamil Tiger\r\nleaders. They assured him that they would not recruit\r\nany person under the age of 17 and would not send into\r\nbattle any person below the age of 18. A few months\r\nago he stated that since his visit to Sri Lanka there have\r\nbeen continuous reports of the recruitment and the use\r\nof children by the Tamil Tigers. The assurance they\r\ngave him has been totally dishonoured. In a poignant\r\nanswer to a question by an interviewer, the Special\r\nRepresentative said this:\r\n“Children who become soldiers lose their\r\ninnocence. Part of the reason why the fighting\r\ngroups will tend to reach out to children is\r\nbecause, of course, the adults may become\r\ndisillusioned, they may be killed off, they may\r\nrun away, so they reach the children who are less\r\nable to defend themselves. But there’s a more\r\ncynical reason than that: children, because they\r\nare innocent, can be moulded into the most\r\nunquestioning, ruthless tools of warfare, into\r\nsuicide commandos, into committing the worst\r\natrocities. In other situations, it is ideology —\r\ncome fight for the homeland, come fight for our\r\nethnic group, come fight for a new society — that\r\nmay appeal to families and to children. So there\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nare many reasons which facilitate the abuse of\r\nchildren in this way.”\r\nI thank the Special Representative for having had\r\nthe courage to speak out on this important issue. To\r\nremain silent in the face of such criminality is to\r\nencourage and condone it. It is the duty of all of us\r\nwho care about the children of the world to rally\r\nagainst the cruelty, brutality and the grievous harm\r\ncynically inflicted on them by groups such as the one\r\nthat abuses them in Sri Lanka. A few months ago, the\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations Children’s Fund in\r\nSri Lanka told journalists — and I thank him for his\r\nstatement — that the situation of children in the areas\r\nheld by the Tamil Tigers had worsened since they gave\r\ntheir assurance to the United Nations Special\r\nRepresentative. Parents have reported that their\r\nchildren have been recruited. It is a serious problem.\r\nHe observed that until they, the Liberation Tigers of\r\nTamil Eelam (LTTE), announce to their own people\r\nthat they have taken measures to prevent children\r\nbelow 17 years from being recruited, we cannot take\r\ntheir promises seriously.\r\nA respected and courageous human rights group\r\nin Sri Lanka, consisting mostly of Tamil teachers who\r\nused to teach at Jaffna University, have said in a recent\r\nreport that since last May a fresh child-recruitment\r\ncampaign has been launched by the Tamil Tigers.\r\nAccording to their report, children as young as 10 years\r\nare being forcibly conscripted, age being no\r\nconsideration as long as the child was able to carry a\r\ngun. In recent days and months the international press\r\nhas focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers in\r\nSri Lanka.\r\nA few days ago Sri Lanka deposited its\r\ninstrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol on\r\nthe Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. This Protocol\r\nhas noted that the Statute of the International Criminal\r\nCourt makes conscripting, enlisting or using children in\r\ncombat a war crime in both international and non-\r\ninternational armed conflicts. It holds non-State actors\r\nalso accountable for such crimes and it calls upon State\r\nparties to cooperate in preventing and combating such\r\ncrimes.\r\nAccordingly, today, in this General Assembly of\r\nthe United Nations Sri Lanka calls upon all States to\r\nratify this Protocol, and it calls upon the State parties\r\non whose territory the LTTE has offices and front\r\norganizations to take strong punitive action against\r\nsuch establishments, and to declare the LTTE a\r\ncriminal organization, as the LTTE sustains its criminal\r\nactivity in respect of the use of child soldiers through\r\nfunds generated on the territories of other State parties,\r\nwhich are obliged to cooperate in terms of the\r\nConvention and the Protocol.\r\nThe Winnipeg Conference ended yesterday with\r\nan impassioned plea to the world to move urgently\r\nfrom words to deeds, to save the hundreds of thousands\r\nof children who are abused, maimed, displaced,\r\ntraumatized and killed by war. In our cruel world if\r\nanything should stir the conscience of mankind it is\r\nsurely the plight of these children. Let it not be said\r\nthat yet again we have failed — failed to hear and heed\r\nthe anguished cry of children in distress, children on\r\nwhom adults have inflicted, and continue to inflict,\r\nunspeakable cruelty. No, politics cannot divide us on\r\nthe issue of child soldiers. Massive funds are not\r\nrequired to save them. What is required is the will and\r\nthe commitment to act of those States which are in a\r\nposition to act. The Winnipeg appeal is addressed to\r\nthem. Let us all wholeheartedly support that appeal\r\nnow so that when the special session of the General\r\nAssembly for Follow-up to the World Summit for\r\nChildren is held here in New York next September, we\r\nwill be able to adopt practical measures that will finally\r\nensure that children will be forever protected from the\r\nravages of war.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I call\r\non His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uruguay and former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Opertti (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme to begin by thanking the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his\r\nwork as President of the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, during which he continued and\r\nconcluded the preparation process of the recent\r\nMillennium Summit, initiated during the preceding\r\nsession.\r\nLikewise, I extend to the President of the\r\nAssembly at the fifty-fifth session, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\nformer Prime Minister of Finland, our congratulations\r\nand best wishes for the success of his tenure.\r\nWe also extend a fraternal welcome to Tuvalu as\r\na new Member of the United Nations.\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nA little over a week ago the United Nations held\r\nits Millennium Summit. To be more precise, we held\r\nour Millennium Summit. The work of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and of the Member States deserves our praise,\r\nfor the result of their efforts was wholly positive. We\r\nshould all congratulate ourselves on that very\r\nsuccessful work, but the task assigned to us by the\r\nSummit is now in our hands. It should begin with an\r\nassessment and careful evaluation of agreements,\r\ndisagreements and priorities.\r\nAbove all, we should pay special attention to the\r\nstatements made by our heads of State and\r\nGovernment, as well as to the oral summary reports by\r\neach of the Presidents of the four round tables. Taken\r\nas a whole, this constitutes rich background material on\r\nwhich we could, and should, work. One could say that\r\nthe General Assembly, as a universal and independent\r\nbody, has been entrusted with a mandate by the highest\r\npolitical leaders of the Member States. Interpreting and\r\ncarrying out that mandate is now the main objective of\r\nour work in the General Assembly.\r\nOf course, the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/54/2000), known by the opening words of its title,\r\n“We the peoples”, is an essential contribution, widely\r\nappreciated at this time of putting the Organization in\r\nperspective. For that reason, the Secretary-General\r\ndeserves our sincere acknowledgement.\r\nWe can therefore say that never before have we\r\nhad more authoritative or exact guidelines. As the\r\nSecretary-General said in his opening statement, the\r\nresponsibility for putting those directives into practice\r\nis in our hands; in other words, in the non-exclusive\r\nframework of the General Assembly.\r\nFrom the very start of our renewed task we must\r\ntry to identify some central ideas that reflect a general\r\nconsensus on our point of departure, while\r\nacknowledging that neither the Summit nor any similar\r\nUnited Nations meetings will be able to make any\r\narbitrary changes to the items on the world’s agenda or\r\nalone bring about the alterations that practically all of\r\nus view as necessary and inevitable.\r\nIt is therefore a matter of using the Millennium\r\nSummit as a launching platform for the achievement of\r\nthe common objectives of the international community,\r\nwhose main quality should be to reflect the basic rights\r\nand interests of all its members. We should, then, be as\r\ncareful in identifying those goals as we are in selecting\r\nthe procedures and determining the time required to\r\nachieve them. In any case, there are some realities that\r\nwe cannot, and should not, evade.\r\nThe first is the acknowledgement that the so-\r\ncalled globalization or universalization phenomenon\r\nconstitutes the inescapable environment to which the\r\nhuman family should adapt, not from a stance of\r\nconfrontation or resigned acceptance, but in order to be\r\nan active part of it. By living within the framework of\r\nglobalization we will be in a position to direct and\r\nchannel it, accepting its intrinsic values in its scientific\r\nand technological dimension, while conferring upon it\r\nthe necessary inspiration and political will to control its\r\nnegative effects on societies that lack the necessary\r\nresources to be part of globalization and to benefit\r\nfrom it.\r\nIt has been said here at the Assembly that we\r\nshould attempt to make it possible for all States to\r\nclimb aboard the globalization train. That goal should\r\nmotivate our individual actions and our cooperation\r\nefforts in the immediate future.\r\nAs was repeatedly emphasized during the\r\nSummit, United Nations action of the kind I have\r\ndescribed would have an encouraging and positive\r\neffect, especially since no other international institution\r\nhas undertaken that task. Given the universal and all-\r\ninclusive nature of globalization, it is appropriate to\r\nconsider what action the United Nations could take\r\nfrom the perspective of evolution and change of the\r\ninternational system in its three principal areas: first,\r\nthe institutional political system — the Organization\r\nitself and its powers; secondly, the global financial\r\nsystem established by the Bretton Woods Agreements;\r\nand, finally, the organization of international trade\r\nwithin the framework of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO).\r\nWith regard to the first, it must be admitted that\r\nin the process of reform of the Security Council, to\r\nwhich we have devoted so much effort, no significant\r\nprogress has been registered recently. It would appear\r\nthat the international community has not yet\r\nsufficiently assimilated its will to change at the\r\ninstitutional level. That admission does not take away\r\nfrom the fact that the reform of the Council is a\r\npending matter and one which, as the round table\r\nreports indicated, received particular attention from the\r\nheads of State and Government at the Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nIt seems to us that on this matter we have reached\r\na paradoxical situation. On the one hand, there is\r\npractically a consensus on the need to reform the\r\nCouncil so that it can — on the basis of certain\r\nprinciples held very dear by the international\r\ncommunity — more adequately reflect current reality,\r\nbeing made more democratic in its spirit, more\r\nrepresentative in its structure and more transparent in\r\nits functioning. On the other hand, however, some\r\nbelieve that the formula proposed to achieve the goal\r\nof expanding the Council — an increase in both\r\npermanent and non-permanent members — disregards\r\nthe very principles that we seek to implement. We have\r\nthus responded to the need felt by all for reform of the\r\nCouncil, in order to make it more representative and\r\ndemocratic, with formulas that do not yet appear to\r\nreflect the requisite universal spirit of reform.\r\nThat is why we believe that, while we continue\r\nour efforts to reorganize the Security Council, we must\r\nalso explore alternative solutions avoiding the\r\napproaches — perhaps too simplistic — adopted so far,\r\nwhich have not made progress possible, even after\r\neight years of intensive negotiations. New approaches\r\nand ideas are needed in the reform of the Council more\r\nthan in any other problem.\r\nPeacekeeping and international security continues\r\nto be a core issue giving the United Nations its specific\r\ncharacter and, to a certain degree, its reason for being.\r\nThe Organization’s peacekeeping and international\r\nsecurity mechanisms, the limits within which they can\r\noperate and their modalities have been on our agenda\r\nsince the founding of the United Nations. They\r\ncontinue to require our attention, because problems of\r\npeace and international security manifest themselves in\r\nvarying and sometimes unexpected ways as the world\r\npolitical situation evolves.\r\nThe United Nations is now confronted with the\r\nworrisome problem of how to achieve its peacekeeping\r\ngoals with limited resources and inadequate\r\nmechanisms. The report on peace operations prepared\r\nby a group of experts, known as the Brahimi report and\r\ndrafted at the request of the Secretary-General, will\r\nundoubtedly help us find a way to overcome the\r\ndifficulties now facing the Organization in this area.\r\nUruguay, since 1952 a traditional contributor to\r\npeacekeeping operations, is carefully considering the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Brahimi report,\r\nmany of which we deem worthy of our support.\r\nIn any event, we warmly welcome the initiatives\r\naimed at a more in-depth consideration of what has\r\nbeen termed “humanitarian intervention”. We hope that\r\na detailed and objective examination of this concept by\r\nthe Organization will enable us to grasp its true scope\r\nand implications and to find ways of integrating it\r\nharmoniously into the international legal order, without\r\nany kind of distortion.\r\nThe financing of peacekeeping operations\r\nrequires the prudent management of existing resources\r\nand, as with the regular budget, that all Member States\r\nfulfil their financial obligations to the Organization,\r\nwithout conditions. Likewise, the institutionalization of\r\nthe current scale of assessments is vital, perhaps with a\r\nfew small changes that would not create problems for\r\ndeveloping or least developed countries and that would\r\nensure that States shoulder their responsibility\r\naccording to their real capacity to pay.\r\nThis is also our position on the regular budget.\r\nWe cannot accept that, in determining the scale of\r\nassessments, simplistic formulas should be used that\r\nare based only on isolated economic indicators such as\r\nper capita income, which do not reflect the real\r\neconomic situation of the country and of its population.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize the link between the\r\nquestion of disarmament and that of development\r\nfinancing. The fact that the majority of violent conflicts\r\noccur in the developing sector of the world, in which\r\nthere are often too many weapons and too few schools,\r\nremains a shameful paradox. We must continue to work\r\ntowards disarmament. That is why my country,\r\nUruguay, supports the convening of the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, set to take place next\r\nyear.\r\nUruguay also supports the efforts of the “New\r\nAgenda” countries towards the elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons and encourages the ratification of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nAs concerns the international financial system —\r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World\r\nBank — and its handling of the recent, recurrent crisis\r\nsituations in the world, shortcomings were noted in its\r\nmethods of operation. In particular, its failure to\r\nanticipate those crises has made clear the need to\r\nupdate and reform the system directly responsible for\r\nensuring global economic governance. In this effort to\r\nreorganize the financial institutions and to coordinate\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\ntheir activities with those of the United Nations and its\r\nagencies, we should also consider the common\r\naspiration of the majority of the members of the\r\ninternational community to democratize the decision-\r\nmaking processes in those organizations. The close\r\nconnection between the decisions by the World Bank\r\nand the International Monetary Fund, and the social\r\nand economic realities of countries, more than justifies\r\nthis aspiration.\r\nInequality, poverty and debt in the developing\r\nworld are problems that have been, and continue to be,\r\nemphasized in the debates of the Millennium\r\nAssembly. These problems require not only ongoing\r\nprogrammes and actions but, above all, a basic sense of\r\nsolidarity, which does not always characterize our\r\ncooperation efforts.\r\nIn the same vein, two noteworthy ideas were put\r\nforward during the Summit that we believe should be\r\nconsidered, because they could offer some guidance in\r\nefficiently addressing economic issues. The first is the\r\nidea of creating a development council that is neither\r\ndependent nor subordinate and that has the authority to\r\ntake the decisions necessary to adjust and direct\r\ncomplex international financial flows, since the trends\r\nand developments in that respect affect the economies\r\nof all States.\r\nThe second is related to international trade. In\r\nthis regard, the international community is firmly\r\nconvinced that international trade must be made\r\nincreasingly open and free. The President of Uruguay,\r\nMr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez, in his address to the Summit\r\nand in the relevant round table, emphasized the\r\nindivisible nature of freedom, as a whole that cannot be\r\nseparated from free trade.\r\nAs trade is a natural and traditional method of\r\ncommunication among peoples, Member States must\r\nnot impose protectionist barriers to its free flow, which\r\nwould delay development and therefore affect the well-\r\nbeing of peoples. This could also lead to serious social\r\nproblems, which in many cases could spiral out of\r\ncontrol. In this way, obstacles to trade, discriminatory\r\ntrade policies and protectionism could become factors\r\nof political instability at the domestic and international\r\nlevels. This is the position of Uruguay within the\r\nSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR), in the\r\nrelationship between MERCOSUR and the Andean\r\nCommunity, in the Free Trade Area of the Americas\r\nand in the World Trade Organization (WTO).\r\nThe strong argument to that effect put forward at\r\nthe Summit must not be disregarded by those Member\r\nStates that singly or together selectively raise\r\nprotectionist barriers in order selfishly to defend their\r\nown production and participation in the market,\r\ndenying others what President Batlle has called\r\n“our right to create and produce and our right to\r\noffer and sell what is produced”.\r\nIn this regard, I cannot but welcome the initiative\r\nof the Government of Italy, announced by its Prime\r\nMinister during the Summit, to insist, within\r\ninternational organisms — including within the Group\r\nof 8 — on the need for the developed countries to open\r\ntheir markets to the least developed countries by\r\nabolishing quotas and tariffs.\r\nNor can the WTO cannot turn a deaf ear to this\r\ncall. Although it does not play a major role in global\r\nfinancial governance, its regulations affect trade in its\r\nbroadest sense, and it still counts among its\r\nresponsibilities, set out at the Uruguay Round and in\r\nthe Marrakesh agreements, the regulation of trade in\r\nagricultural products, which affects many of our\r\ncountries, particularly those of Latin America and\r\nAfrica.\r\nToday no one could doubt the role of the United\r\nNations in the gradual process of achieving equality in\r\nthe world. But the United Nations does not bear sole\r\nresponsibility in this respect; the Member States and\r\nGovernments do as well.\r\nA solid and hopeful future for the international\r\ncommunity will depend on our good judgement and\r\nintegrity. Also at stake is the trust of our peoples and of\r\npublic opinion. Fortunately, for those of us who\r\npractise the democratic creed, that trust is always time-\r\nbound and subject to public opinion.\r\nOur ability to work within the Organization will\r\ndetermine whether the Millennium Summit that just\r\ntook place will breathe new life into the United\r\nNations. The world needs to see itself reflected in the\r\ninstitutions it established, with hope and participation,\r\nwith responsibility and a will to build a fairer, more\r\npredictable, more peaceful and more humane society.\r\nI therefore believe — and this is merely a\r\nsuggestion — that it is essential for all of us to ensure\r\nthat the Assembly is accorded the important role\r\nassigned to it in the Charter, even though reality\r\nsometimes does not allow for this. We must ensure that\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nthe Assembly and the Secretariat establish as soon as\r\npossible a working group or a similar mechanism that\r\nwould follow up on the Millennium Summit and would\r\nexamine the wealth of ideas put forward by our heads\r\nof State to ensure that they can be implemented and put\r\ninto practice. Only in that way will the Millennium\r\nSummit be remembered.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Clifford Mamba,\r\nhead of the delegation of Swaziland.\r\nMr. Mamba (Swaziland): Mr. President, on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of His Majesty King Mswati\r\nIII, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi and the Government\r\nand the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland, may I\r\nextend hearty congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri of\r\nthe Republic of Finland on his election as President of\r\nthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also\r\nwish to pay my country’s rich tribute to Mr. Holkeri’s\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, for his\r\nexemplary stewardship of the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to develop\r\nquietly and peacefully, according to the wishes of our\r\npeople. Against a backdrop of difficult economic\r\ncircumstances, we have declared the year 2000 our\r\nYear of Delivery in a number of key economic, social\r\nand political areas. In the coming weeks, the\r\nCommission that is reviewing the national Constitution\r\nwill complete its work, and we look forward to\r\nreceiving its report. Those recommendations will be\r\nthe result of an extensive and all-inclusive process of\r\nconsultations and will reflect precisely the wishes of\r\nthe entire Swazi nation. We believe this national\r\nexercise will further enhance the unity of the Swazi\r\npeople and provide the best possible foundation for our\r\ncontinuing peace and stability.\r\nOn the economic front, we continue to make\r\nevery effort to achieve sustainable growth and to\r\nreduce the level of poverty among our people. In\r\naddition to encouraging both local and foreign\r\ninvestment, the Government this year launched an\r\nambitious programme of initiatives called the\r\nMillennium Project, targeting the tourism and\r\nmanufacturing industry subsectors. This project is\r\ndesigned to maximize the potential of the Kingdom in\r\nthese areas and to reduce the current unacceptably high\r\nlevel of unemployment, which is threatening to\r\nundermine all our best efforts at development.\r\nAmong the many challenges we face as a\r\ndeveloping nation, there is no question that the\r\nHIV/AIDS crisis presents the most serious threat to our\r\nhopes of improving the lives of our people. In the last\r\nyears of the twentieth century, much of the progress we\r\nhave achieved in 32 years of independence in social\r\nwelfare is being reversed by the rapid spread of this\r\nmost terrible disease. HIV/AIDS represents the single\r\nmost important issue facing our nation today, and we\r\ndesperately need the support of the international\r\ncommunity in our efforts to contain the threat to our\r\nvery existence as a nation. We look to the United\r\nNations to take a much stronger leadership role in this\r\nglobal crisis, and to help us to mobilize resources to\r\nreverse the catastrophic spread of the pandemic.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit, the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland joined other developing countries in\r\nexpressing concern at the negative effects of\r\nglobalization on our economies, especially in the\r\ncontext of the widening gap between the rich and the\r\npoor countries. We are, however, reassured by\r\nSummit’s agreement to take measures to ensure that\r\nglobal trends such as globalization should have at their\r\nheart the principle of equitable benefit for all nations,\r\nregardless of size, level of development or economic\r\nstrength.\r\nThus, in recent years, we have waited with great\r\nexpectation to benefit from initiatives, particularly in\r\nthe area of preferential trade access, that have been\r\nbroadcast by our international friends and partners as\r\nmeasures that are designed to help the developing\r\nworld to overcome the negative effects of\r\nglobalization.\r\nMy delegation is optimistic, therefore, that the\r\nrecently concluded Millennium Summit will indeed\r\nserve as an historic occasion of strengthening\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as the\r\nprosperity of our people, in order to establish a fair\r\ninternational order. Beginning with this session, what\r\nremains for all of us now is to see to it that the wishes\r\nof the founding fathers of the United Nations are\r\nfulfilled. Those wishes, ambitious as they may be, are\r\nnot unreachable and can be achieved. This session,\r\ntherefore, has the task of setting the pace for the\r\ndialogue that lies ahead. Both the Millennium Summit\r\nand this session of the General Assembly will have a\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\ndirect impact on the success of the United Nations in\r\nachieving the goals set by those great visionary leaders.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly,\r\nthe Organization has held several global conferences.\r\nHowever, the implementation of commitments in some\r\ncases is regrettably slow. One of the priorities for the\r\nUnited Nations should be an effective, integrated and\r\ncoordinated implementation and follow-up of all these\r\nconferences. The implementation should be further\r\nenhanced within the existing machinery of the United\r\nNations through improving its functions.\r\nPeace-building is a prevention task of growing\r\nimportance. With the disaster that befell the United\r\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), the\r\nUnited Nations is facing one of the most\r\ncomprehensive tasks in its history, which perhaps has\r\nmade the need to review peacekeeping operations more\r\nimperative. We remain concerned about the serious\r\nnegative impact of the proliferation of conflicts in the\r\nworld, particularly in Africa, on development capacity\r\nand on progress towards economic, social and political\r\ntransformation. The situation in those countries\r\naffected by conflicts is appalling and deserves the\r\nOrganization’s urgent attention.\r\nIn Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nRwanda, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Angola, among\r\nothers, have been the scene of terrible turmoil, mass\r\nmurders, destruction of property and much suffering on\r\nthe part of refugees over the years. The Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) have done\r\nmuch to contain and resolve some of these conflicts;\r\nand the United Nations has also rendered its support.\r\nWhile some progress has been made in resolving some\r\nof these conflicts, much still needs to be done,\r\nespecially by the parties involved. The latter have a\r\nresponsibility to observe agreements concluded and\r\nmust work closely together with the United Nations\r\nand the regional organizations involved so that peace\r\nprocesses can be brought to a successful conclusion.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, we are\r\nencouraged by the continued efforts by President\r\nClinton and other leaders to bring both Israel and\r\nPalestine to the negotiating table. We are hopeful that a\r\nlong-lasting solution, which has eluded the region for\r\nso long, will be found soon.\r\nThere is now more than ever a pressing need to\r\nfinally carry out the long overdue substantial reform of\r\nthe Security Council. The Council must fully recognize\r\nthe new realities of the global landscape. It must have a\r\nmore representative composition, and above all, it must\r\nbe equipped to react to the crises and conflicts of today.\r\nReform must involve enlargement to include both more\r\npermanent and non-permanent members, as well as\r\nstrengthening its decision-making powers.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland unreservedly supports\r\nboth the Non-Aligned Movement and the African\r\nGroup positions in as far as the review of the\r\ncomposition and working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil is concerned. We do trust that the ongoing\r\ndebate in the working group set up for this purpose will\r\ncontinue and that it will yield the much-expected\r\nresults. The stage which the negotiations have now\r\nreached is such that it requires the commitment of all\r\nMember States if indeed the Security Council is to be\r\nequipped with all the tools it needs to be equitably\r\nrepresentative. Participation of the United Nations\r\nmembership at large in the decision-making process,\r\ntransparency in its work and imposition of Charter\r\nrestraints on the veto, with the aim of its eventual\r\nabolition, are indispensable imperatives.\r\nThe enhancement of the relevance of the United\r\nNations requires, first and foremost, strengthening the\r\nrole and increasing the efficiency of the General\r\nAssembly through focusing its deliberations on\r\ncontemporary challenges and problems facing the\r\nworld, engaging it in timely and effective decision-\r\nmaking to address global economic and political issues\r\nand enabling it to seriously examine and effectively\r\nreact to the work of the other organs of the United\r\nNations, particularly the Security Council. In this\r\ncontext, we believe that the General Assembly, as the\r\nsole democratic universal and transparent organ, is the\r\nproper forum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the\r\nimplications of the emerging debates on collective\r\naction.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland joins others in\r\nwelcoming the Republic of Tuvalu as a new member of\r\nthe Organization. The addition of Tuvalu brings closer\r\nto fruition the hope of the founding fathers to see a\r\nUnited Nations comprised of all the countries of the\r\nworld. The United Nations is the only body that deals\r\nwith all fields of human activity. It has been a catalyst\r\nof many initiatives that have improved the lives of\r\npeoples across the world.\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nIn the same spirit of universality in which we\r\nwelcome Tuvalu, the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to\r\nreiterate its appeal to the United Nations regarding the\r\nquestion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland has in the past been in the\r\nforefront arguing in favour of the readmission of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, and our position remains\r\nunchanged. The case for including the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan in the activities of the United Nations\r\nand its associated agencies takes on even greater\r\nrelevance in the light of the peaceful transition of\r\nGovernment following the successful expression of the\r\nwishes of the people of Taiwan in the elections earlier\r\nthis year.\r\nThose 23 million people rightly consider it\r\nunacceptable that they are not represented in the one\r\nOrganization that should be truly global, and that they\r\ndeserve a review of the special circumstances\r\nsurrounding their bid. The Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan has shown time and again its willingness to\r\nparticipate in efforts to bring about true global peace,\r\ndevelopment and stability, and we believe that the rest\r\nof the world is poorer for being denied their\r\ninvolvement. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that\r\nthis new millennium provides the perfect opportunity\r\nto raise this issue and to restore the right of the people\r\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan to participate fully\r\nin the activities of our Organization.\r\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations. Its\r\nobjectives and values are universal. We must spare no\r\neffort in seeing to it that the United Nations continues\r\nto meet the current and evolving needs of its entire\r\nmembership. It must become the core instrument of\r\neffective and fair global governance, if it is to be\r\ncompletely transformed to be what its founding fathers\r\nhad envisaged.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Mahamat Saleh\r\nAnnadif, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chad.\r\nMr. Annadif (Chad) (spoke in French): It was by\r\nunanimous vote that our Assembly elected our\r\nPresident to be in charge of our work. Whereas we are\r\nalready aware of his professional skills and his human\r\nqualities, may I take the liberty of congratulating him\r\nand assuring him of the support and the cooperation of\r\nthe delegation of Chad to assist him in performing this\r\ndifficult but very inspiring task.\r\nHis predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof fraternal Namibia, very tactfully and effectively\r\nguided the work which was entrusted to him during the\r\nfifty-fourth session. He is now deserving of our\r\ncongratulations.\r\nOur words of congratulations and our\r\nencouragement are likewise addressed to our brother,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose devotion to the cause of peace\r\nand development in the world undoubtedly represents a\r\nguarantee for the success of our Organization.\r\nLast year during a visit to the headquarters of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme in New York,\r\nthe President of the Republic of Chad, His Excellency\r\nMr. Idriss Deby, declared:\r\n“A new world is being built before our very\r\neyes. New standards are being set which are\r\ngiving lasting shape to the behaviours of\r\nindividuals and relations among States. New\r\ntechnologies are pressing us forward to even\r\ngreater progress in those societies which possess\r\nthem. Those which are closed to change are being\r\nmarginalized, since they are incapable of making\r\ntheir ambitions come to life in the context of the\r\nnew world. This frightening prospect, since it is\r\nsynonymous with being left behind, is very real\r\nfor many developing countries. But, I reject this\r\nprospect for my country.”\r\nThe President of the Republic is here referring\r\nspecifically to a world which is in constant change\r\nbecause of rampant globalization, which has become a\r\nfact of life that is sometimes highly praised for its\r\nbenefits and sometimes shunned because of the harm it\r\ndoes. Meanwhile in Chad, men and women are doing\r\neverything they can to derive benefit from\r\nglobalization and to avoid the downside in order not to\r\nmiss the train of political, economic, social and\r\ntechnological progress.\r\nIn other words, faced with the threat that\r\nglobalization represents to stability, security and\r\ndevelopment of the weaker, Chad is waging an out and\r\nout struggle to occupy its proper place in the concert of\r\nnations.\r\nYes, the men and women of Chad are struggling\r\ncourageously and with resolve to emerge from\r\nobscurantism, from poverty and from domination. The\r\nresults of their daily struggle speak for themselves\r\nwhen you look at what has been achieved in the various\r\n36\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nareas of national life. Politically, the democratic\r\nexperiment which began on 1 December 1990 is being\r\nfurther developed and consolidated. Thus, political\r\npluralism is functioning while respecting diversity on\r\nthe basis of consensual and participatory democracy.\r\nThe various fundamental freedoms which\r\nunderlie and which breathe life into any democratic\r\npolitical system are being fully exercised. The freedom\r\nof expression of the private press, which gives no\r\nquarter in its criticism of the action of the Government,\r\nas well as the burgeoning of associations of civil\r\nsociety, particularly those dealing with human rights,\r\nyoung people and women, bears witness to the political\r\ndetermination of the Government of Chad to promote a\r\nculture of democracy.\r\nIn this connection, particular attention should be\r\npaid to strengthening the role of women in public life,\r\nas well as the rights of and the protection of children.\r\nLikewise, through the establishment of a supreme\r\ncourt, a constitutional council and a superior council of\r\njudges, the final touches have been put on the judicial\r\ninstitutions that underpin our democratic system.\r\nFurthermore, I am pleased to recall that the first multi-\r\nparty elections took place in Chad in 1996 in a climate\r\nof calm and transparency, as the international observers\r\nnoted. The next elections will take place in six months.\r\nIn general, the political authorities in Chad are doing\r\nall they can to ensure their success.\r\nI would therefore like to emphasize from this\r\nrostrum that Chad’s attachment to pluralistic\r\ndemocracy cannot be unseated, because the people of\r\nChad as a whole are profoundly convinced that this is\r\nthe only way — indeed their unique opportunity — to\r\nimprove their living conditions. The most recent\r\nmeetings in Syrte, Libya, and the various declarations\r\nmade by Chadian political actors are all encouraging\r\nsigns that, as we would like, this attachment is firm. In\r\nall events, the Government of Chad welcomes these\r\nnew arrangements, which are to be seen as part and\r\nparcel of the policy of outreach that has been\r\nadvocated by His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Chad.\r\nAfter gaining this hard-won peace and this firm\r\nattachment to democracy, the Government of Chad\r\nquite naturally then proceeded — with the support of\r\ninternational institutions and Chad’s bilateral\r\npartners — to tackle the question of economic and\r\nsocial development. A genuine plan to fight poverty\r\nhas been created. This plan includes the elaboration of\r\na national strategy for the reduction of poverty. This\r\nstrategy has been further strengthened by the fact that\r\nthe objectives of poverty reduction and economic\r\ngrowth during the 2000-2002 period have been made\r\npart of the major, high-priority social and sectoral\r\nprogrammes that were adopted at the Geneva IV round\r\ntable on the development of Chad.\r\nPart of this struggle against poverty is the\r\nstruggle that the people of Chad have waged to\r\ncomplete the project for the extraction and export of its\r\noil. This success was achieved thanks to the\r\ndetermination of the President of the Republic, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Idriss Deby — but also thanks to\r\nunflagging support of the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nand of friends and other partners of Chad. Here we\r\nwould like these supporters to know that the\r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Chad\r\nrecognize and are grateful for their assistance.\r\nChad nevertheless does not see its\r\ndevelopment — and even less its security and\r\nstability — in an isolated fashion. Therefore Chad is\r\ndoing everything possible to make its contribution to\r\ncreating a climate of peace and prosperity in Africa —\r\nparticularly in Central Africa. The subregion of Central\r\nAfrica — despite its immense potential, and perhaps\r\nbecause of this immense potential, I might add — now\r\nappears to be the region of upheaval par excellence, a\r\nregion characterized by armed conflicts and crises of\r\nall sorts. Undoubtedly some hotbeds of tension have\r\nbeen slaked. This is true of the Central African\r\nRepublic and of the Republic of the Congo, which are\r\ngradually regaining their stability. But this stability\r\nremains fragile. The international community therefore\r\nmust help these countries to consolidate this peace by\r\nactions in support of reconstruction and assistance.\r\nTwo other conflicts, unfortunately, persist and\r\nalso dangerously threaten the subregion. One of these\r\nis the conflict occurring in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, where the belligerents’ failure to respect the\r\nLusaka Agreement has unfortunately resulted in\r\nexacerbating the rivalries among the foreign forces in\r\nthe Congolese territory, further complicating the\r\nsituation and holding up the effective implementation\r\nof that Agreement.\r\nAs far as the Angolan conflict is concerned, it has\r\ncertainly become even more complex because of its\r\nduration, the resources that nurture it and all the\r\n37\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\ninternational complicity that Mr. Jonas Savimbi has\r\ntaken advantage of. But we must support the efforts of\r\nthe legitimate and legal Government of Angola, as well\r\nas the efforts of the international community, so that\r\nthis long-suffering people can recover the peace and\r\ntranquillity that they have not known since they\r\nacceded to independence.\r\nIn the framework of the United Nations Standing\r\nAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in Central\r\nAfrica, the States of this subregion have not remained\r\ninactive. They are devoting themselves to exploring\r\nways and means of establishing peace and tranquillity\r\nthrough measures designed first and foremost to create\r\ntrust among themselves.\r\nThe first of these steps is the possibility offered\r\nby the periodic meetings of the Committee. These\r\nprovide an opportunity for political dialogue in the\r\ninterest of preventive diplomacy. For having created\r\nthis Committee, the Security Council is deserving of\r\nour gratitude.\r\nFurthermore, structures and mechanisms to\r\npromote peace and stability are gradually being\r\nestablished. Among others, we might note the\r\nestablishment of an early-warning mechanism in\r\nLibreville and of the subregional centre for human\r\nrights and democracy in Yaoundé. The creation of the\r\nCouncil for Peace and Security in Central Africa is\r\nunder way with the signing, by the heads of State or\r\nGovernment, on 24 February at Malabo, Equatorial\r\nGuinea, of the protocol regarding this Council and the\r\nmutual assistance pact.\r\nIn the area of security there is a plan to organize a\r\njoint military exercise for the peacekeeping operations\r\nof the armed forces of the States of the subregion. As\r\nfor the other contributor to instability — the\r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons — the\r\nmember States held a subregional conference on this\r\ntopic in N’Djamena in October 1999. A number of\r\nmeasures were advocated; among them, we might\r\nmention the project of “arms for development”, which\r\nwas initiated by Canada and certain donor countries —\r\na project that is intended to set up micro-projects to\r\nhelp those who turn in their arms. For the time being\r\nthis project involves the areas along the borders of\r\nCameroon, the Central African Republic and Chad. In\r\nthis connection, a mission of evaluation visited the\r\ncountries concerned in July 2000. The initiative is only\r\nat the conceptual stage, but it is to be hoped that it will\r\ntake concrete form as soon as possible. I would\r\ntherefore like to make an appeal to the other partners to\r\njoin with Canada in order to broaden the scope of these\r\nprojects to include the entire subregion.\r\nInstability and insecurity in Central Africa are\r\nalso among the major causes of refugee flows, a\r\nphenomenon that has spared no State. Aware as we are\r\nof the negative effects of this phenomenon, member\r\nStates took this matter up during a conference that was\r\nheld last August in Bujumbura. The relevant\r\nconclusions of this conference deserve to be supported.\r\nThe political situations in other subregions of the\r\nAfrican continent also concern us. Certainly there has\r\nbeen a definite improvement with the consolidation of\r\ndemocratic institutions, good governance and respect\r\nfor the fundamental rights of the African people.\r\nNevertheless, several crises are persisting and must be\r\na subject of concern for the entire international\r\ncommunity. Thus in West Africa, Sierra Leone has not\r\nyet achieved peace, despite the commitments entered\r\ninto by the parties to the conflict. Chad, for its part,\r\ngives its total support to the efforts of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\r\nUnited Nations to seek peace in this embattled country.\r\nLikewise, we have every confidence in ECOWAS to\r\nsmooth out the difficulties between Liberia and Guinea.\r\nWith regard to the conflict between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, His Excellency President Idriss Deby has\r\npersonally dealt with this matter as current President of\r\nthe Community of the Sahel and Saharan States by\r\nsetting up a good offices mission to the leaders of the\r\ntwo fraternal countries, in support of the mediation by\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nThe Government of Chad is very pleased to see\r\nthat the two parties have finally reached a peace\r\nagreement. We encourage them to respect their\r\nindividual commitments in order to bring lasting peace\r\nto this part of the African continent.\r\nRegarding the Somali crisis, Chad welcomes the\r\nfact that the people of Somalia have awakened to their\r\ndestiny through the recent conference of national\r\nreconciliation which was held in Alta, Djibouti, thus\r\ndemonstrating courage and imagination in their\r\ndetermination to endow their countries with republican\r\ninstitutions. The international community must help\r\nthem and encourage them to build further on this\r\ninitiative in order to reach total and just peace.\r\n38\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nThe presence here of a delegation bearing the\r\nname of the Republic of Somalia, whose seat has been\r\nvacant for almost 10 years now, is a matter of pride and\r\nsatisfaction for the friends and the partners of this\r\nfraternal people.\r\nIt is an example that should edify our brothers of\r\nthe Comoros and Burundi.\r\nWe should also congratulate the Government of\r\nDjibouti for their contribution and devotion to the\r\ncause of peace in the subregion.\r\nWe believe it is time to lift completely the\r\nembargo against the Great Socialist People’s Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, because it is no longer justified and\r\narbitrarily penalizes the fraternal Libyan people and,\r\nindeed, beyond them the entire subregion.\r\nChad has not lost sight of the crisis situations\r\nprevailing in other parts of the world.\r\nIn the Middle East, it is following with interest\r\nthe negotiations underway between the Palestinian and\r\nIsraeli authorities and believes that the time for the\r\npeace of the worthy has now come. The parties to the\r\nconflict should seize this historic opportunity and, as\r\nPresident Clinton said: the world should help them to\r\ntake the risk of embarking on peace.\r\nIn Iraq, Chad believes it is urgent to put an end to\r\nthe embargo whose consequences have been so\r\ndisastrous for the civilian population, which is\r\nsuffering the atrocious evils resulting from this unjust\r\ndecision. Quite clearly any solution should also cover\r\nthe very pertinent matter of the prisoners from Kuwait\r\nand other countries.\r\nThe Korean peninsula is showing encouraging\r\nsigns of the two fraternal countries drawing closer to\r\neach other. The historic inter-Korean Summit, which\r\ntook place between the leaders of these countries last\r\nJune, has laid the foundation for trusting relationships\r\nthat are so central for any dialogue.\r\nThe international community should encourage\r\nboth of these countries to press on in order to\r\neventually sign a peace agreement which would pave\r\nthe way to peaceful coexistence.\r\nThe inter-Korean dialogue might also arouse\r\nsome interest on the part of the Taiwan Strait where\r\ntension unfortunately continues to be abnormally high.\r\nWhereas economic and trade relations between the two\r\ncountries are being developed on a regular basis,\r\npolitical relations are non-existent, despite the fact that\r\non both sides of the Strait semi-official structures have\r\nbeen set up which serve as channels of communication\r\nbetween the People’s Republic of China and the\r\nRepublic of China, Taiwan.\r\nBoth parties should show political determination\r\nand imagination in exploring ways and means of\r\nreducing tension and opening a genuine dialogue. In all\r\nevents, the international community is duty bound to\r\nreconsider the whole question of admitting the\r\nRepublic of China, Taiwan to membership of our\r\nOrganization, particularly in light of the weight and the\r\nimportance of the economic role it plays internationally\r\nand the fact that it is so closely involved in actions for\r\ndevelopment and the reduction of poverty.\r\nFor its part, the Government of Chad supports the\r\nrequest by the Republic of China, Taiwan, to seek\r\nmembership in the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies.\r\nI could not conclude my remarks without\r\nreferring to other ills which undermine and sap all the\r\ndevelopment efforts of countries like mine. These ills\r\ninclude indebtedness, protectionist measures in the\r\nmarkets of the northern countries, deterioration in the\r\nterms of trade and various kinds of trafficking.\r\nThose countries which hold the key to the\r\nsolutions to all these ills, particularly the northern\r\ncountries, must go beyond simple declarations of\r\nintention and take concrete steps to relieve countries\r\nfrom the burden of indebtedness, to throw open their\r\nmarkets and to pay a fair price for our exports.\r\nAs if this were not enough, another evil which is\r\neven more insidious and devastating, has made our task\r\neven more difficult. The prospects for solution are\r\nremote indeed and it is to be feared that this will reduce\r\nto nothing our hopes to relieve our peoples of poverty.\r\nI refer to the HIV/AIDS pandemic which brings death\r\nand bereavement to families on a daily basis.\r\nNot only is it a burden for our meagre financial\r\nresources, but also on our human resources,\r\nparticularly young people who are the spearhead of our\r\nnation.\r\nWe have the collective responsibility to\r\neffectively mobilize ways and means to conquer this\r\nscourge which defies the entire international\r\ncommunity as a time when there is so much\r\ntechnological and scientific progress being made.\r\n39\r\nA/55/PV.21\r\nIn the light of all these challenges, Chad believes\r\nthat its development should also benefit from the\r\npolitical and economic integration of Africa, which is\r\nan important and determinant dimension of this global\r\nvillage. Therefore we would welcome and salute the\r\nmajor political acts which have been taken by the\r\nConference of Heads of State and Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on 12 July in\r\nLomé: I refer to the adoption of the Constituent Act of\r\nthe African Union.\r\nThis major historic event, which is the result of a\r\ncollective commitment on the part of the African\r\npeoples, is a responsible reply on the part of today’s\r\nAfrica to meet the number of challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century by means of political, economic and social\r\nintegration.\r\nThe African Union will create the necessary\r\nconditions for genuine partnership in irreversible\r\nglobalization, but a globalization that would not be\r\nsynonymous with exclusion and the dictatorship of the\r\nmarketplace. This globalization, we believe, should be\r\nsynonymous with sharing and openness. It should have\r\na human face or it will not exist at all.\r\nBut none of this can be achieved without further\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations starting with an\r\nenlargement of the Security Council so that it can be\r\nmore effective and, particularly, more legitimate.\r\nIn other words, it is in our interest — in the\r\ninterest of us all — that the Security Council be more\r\nrepresentative of the international community in whose\r\nname it claims to act. What we are referring to here is\r\nthe credibility of its decisions which, unfortunately,\r\nhave long been used against the weaker with its policy\r\nof double standards.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I shall\r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and five minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Shakerian (Islamic Republic of Iran): This\r\nmorning the Israeli delegation raised some baseless\r\naccusations against my country.\r\nIran is among those Middle Eastern countries\r\nwhich have joined the most basic international\r\ninstruments in effect in the disarmament field. My\r\nGovernment is a full party to the main pillars of\r\ninternational disarmament instruments such as the 1925\r\nGeneva Protocol, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons, the Biological Weapons\r\nConvention, the Chemical Weapons Convention and is\r\na signatory State to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty.\r\nDespite numerous calls from the international\r\ncommunity, Israel refuses to accede to those\r\nagreements, and is continuing with its clandestine\r\nprogrammes to develop and produce several kinds of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Israel remains the only\r\nnon-party to the NPT in the Middle East and, at the\r\nsame time, its nuclear programme and unsafeguarded\r\nfacilities continue to be an alarming fact that menace\r\npeace and stability in the Middle East.\r\nMrs. Barghouti (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nThis morning, we heard the statement by the Acting\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Israel. Needless to say,\r\nhis statement was, from our point of view, full of\r\nhistorical and political fallacies, especially as regards\r\nAl-Quds, the Palestinian refugees and the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East. However, my delegation\r\nwill have the opportunity to reply and to clarify the\r\nfacts in the statement that Palestine will make in the\r\nplenary meeting tomorrow morning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.05 p.m.\r\n"
