(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Nicolae Tabacaru, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova.\r\nMr. Tabacaru (Republic of Moldova): Allow me\r\nat the outset, Mr. President, to convey to you our\r\ncordial congratulations and regards on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I am convinced that your competence and\r\nactive cooperation with United Nations Member States\r\nwill pave the way for a successful and fruitful session.\r\nI would also like to express sincere thanks to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, for the effective manner in\r\nwhich he guided the work of the previous session.\r\nAt the same time, I wish to commend Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, the Secretary-General, for his firm leadership\r\nsince taking office and for his visionary and action-\r\noriented report “We the peoples:”. This report, together\r\nwith the forward-looking Millennium Declaration,\r\nadopted two weeks ago at the historic Millennium\r\nSummit, sets an ambitious agenda for the United\r\nNations for the twenty-first century.\r\nI would also like to convey our warmest welcome\r\nto Tuvalu, the newest Member of the United Nations.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, the prospects\r\nfor the international community’s evolution are marked\r\nby justified hopes, generated by the significant changes\r\nthat occurred in the international arena during the last\r\ndecade, yet also by hesitation and sometimes by\r\nscepticism regarding our capacity to efficiently face\r\ntoday’s worldwide challenges. The Millennium Summit\r\noffered a unique opportunity to reflect on the global\r\nproblems that confront the world today and to identify\r\nand act on the challenges ahead. It reaffirmed the\r\ncentrality of the world Organization in addressing the\r\nglobal, social, security and economic needs for the\r\nbenefit of people. We have ahead of us a real challenge\r\nto reshape the United Nations so that it can realize its\r\nuniversal goals of peace, human security, cooperation,\r\npoverty eradication and sustainable development. From\r\nthis perspective, the Republic of Moldova attaches the\r\nutmost importance to the implementation of the\r\ncommitments inscribed in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nThough the international community, and in\r\nparticular international organizations, makes systematic\r\nefforts aimed at resolving conflicts, we should\r\nrecognize that these efforts sometimes fall short of\r\nreaching their proposed goals. Currently, on the\r\nEuropean continent alone, we are witnessing a number\r\nof unresolved conflicts and potentially crisis-\r\ngenerating situations.\r\nDemocratic transformations and economic\r\ndevelopment in some South-Eastern European\r\ncountries, including the Republic of Moldova, are also\r\njeopardized by unresolved internal conflicts. In the past\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\neight years we have made sustained efforts to settle the\r\nconflict in the eastern region of the country, in full\r\ncompliance with the principles of international law and\r\ninternational practice. The mechanism of settlement,\r\ninvolving the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the mediating\r\nStates, Russia and Ukraine, has been established.\r\nMoldova is oriented towards a complete settlement of\r\nthe conflict, respecting the principle of the sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of my country, and at the same\r\ntime granting to the region autonomous status. Despite\r\nthe reasonable compromises proposed by the\r\nconstitutional authorities, separatist tendencies still\r\npersist. It is an apparent peace, which distracts the\r\nattention of the international community from the\r\nimperatives of finding ways to settle the conflict and\r\nsimultaneously impedes economic and democratic\r\nreforms.\r\nThe situation becomes more difficult if the fact\r\nthat the region is over-militarized is taken into account.\r\nTens of thousands of tons of munitions, armaments and\r\nequipment, sometimes accounted for and sometimes\r\nnot, that are limited under the Treaty on Conventional\r\nArmed Forces in Europe (CFE), are deployed in the\r\nregion. An early, complete and unconditional\r\nwithdrawal of foreign troops, munitions and\r\narmaments, as stipulated in the OSCE Istanbul Summit\r\ndocuments, and as required by the CFE Treaty, would\r\nundoubtedly facilitate the peaceful and complete\r\nsettlement of this conflict. I express our hope that,\r\ntogether with our partners, and assisted by the relevant\r\ninternational organizations, we will be able to ensure\r\nthe implementation of the schedule for the withdrawal\r\nof foreign troops from the territory of Moldova. I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to express our\r\ngratitude for the political and financial support granted\r\nby a number of States in order to facilitate the process\r\nof withdrawal and the destruction of the armaments.\r\nAlthough some of the so-called frozen conflicts,\r\nat least in our region, do not appear to be getting\r\nworse, there is a growing sense of frustration that the\r\nsolution is not yet within our reach. It is therefore\r\nimperative to enhance political awareness regarding\r\nunresolved or potential conflicts, with a view to\r\nactively involving the United Nations and relevant\r\nregional organizations in their settlement.\r\nIt is well known that the settlement of an ongoing\r\nconflict requires incomparably greater political,\r\nfinancial and moral efforts than are needed at the stage\r\nof preventing conflict. It has become obvious that\r\nUnited Nations mechanisms and strategies for dealing\r\nwith threats to stability are inadequate. They need to be\r\nstrengthened, not only to resolve conflicts and conflict\r\nsituations, but, more important, to prevent them. From\r\nthis perspective, the Republic of Moldova fully\r\nsupports the Secretary-General’s efforts to direct the\r\nUnited Nations strategy towards conflict prevention.\r\nWe welcome the Brahimi report on peacekeeping\r\noperations. In our view the implementation of its\r\nrecommendations will significantly consolidate the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations in conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nMember States should provide the Organization\r\nwith the necessary support to enhance the rapid\r\ndeployment capabilities of the United Nations through\r\nthe involvement of the United Nations standby\r\narrangements system. Given this context, I would like\r\nto inform the Assembly that Moldova has already\r\nestablished the legal and institutional framework for its\r\nfuture participation in peacekeeping operations and the\r\nUnited Nations standby arrangements system.\r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation are essential\r\nelements of the security architecture. The Republic of\r\nMoldova, like many other countries, considers that we\r\nshould continue our efforts to achieve disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation, with universal ratification of the\r\nmajor multilateral disarmament instruments and\r\nnegotiations on biological weapons, ballistic missiles\r\nand small arms. In particular, we should reaffirm the\r\nrole of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty as the\r\ncornerstone of international peace, security and\r\nstrategic stability. The Republic of Moldova attaches\r\nthe utmost importance also to the issue of small and\r\nlight weapons, primarily to the effort to create effective\r\ninternational mechanisms for the prevention of their\r\nillegal transfer, especially in areas of conflict. In this\r\nrespect, we are prepared to bring our contribution to\r\nthe preparation of the international conference on illicit\r\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons in all its\r\naspects, to be held next summer.\r\nMy country highly appreciates the proposals of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the issues of development and\r\npoverty eradication as reflected in the millennium\r\nreport and in the report on the work of the Organization\r\nsubmitted to the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nIn conditions of globalization, which has\r\ngenerated profound transformations in the global\r\neconomy, this issue becomes even more important,\r\nparticularly for less developed States and for States\r\nwith economies in transition. A United Nations system\r\nbetter adapted to the necessities of economic\r\ndevelopment should pay more attention to the\r\nharmonization of commercial policies, cooperation in\r\nthe technological field, and the monetary policies of\r\nmember States and international institutions.\r\nIn these efforts, the United Nations should enlist\r\nthe support of governmental economic and financial\r\ninstitutions, the private sector and non-governmental\r\norganizations, thus promoting a partnership with a view\r\nto development. A redefinition of the cooperation\r\nframework and international help is needed, which\r\nshould involve new strategies and investment policies.\r\nMy country favours the elaboration of strategies of and\r\nmeasures for globalization management, and also\r\nfavours the holding of a special session of the General\r\nAssembly regarding globalization and a United Nations\r\nconference on the less developed countries next year.\r\nIn order to reach sustainable development\r\nfocused on the human being, there is a need to improve\r\nthe partnership among developing and developed\r\ncountries, international institutions and civil society.\r\nWe consider that the United Nations, as a framework\r\nfor international cooperation, should play a key role in\r\nsupporting and coordinating national efforts. Within\r\nthe framework of the United Nations development\r\nprogrammes and funds, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) plays a special role\r\nin human sustainable development. United Nations\r\nassistance provided through UNDP has contributed to\r\nstrengthening the legal and institutional framework\r\nnecessary for the continuation of countries’ reforms.\r\nCurrently, the framework for cooperation between\r\nthe Republic of Moldova and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme embraces approximately 40\r\nprojects in the fields of governing and democracy,\r\nenvironmental protection and regeneration, the\r\nprotection of fundamental human rights and freedoms,\r\nthe promotion of women, poverty reduction and\r\neradication, economic and social strategies, and human\r\nsustainable development. I would also like to mention\r\nthe important role of the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe. By promoting the\r\ndissemination and implementation of the instruments\r\nof the Commission, we would ensure the adjustment of\r\neconomies in transition to international and European\r\nstandards. Thus, the projects implemented by the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe\r\nwould contribute directly to the integration of these\r\neconomies into the world economy.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova supports the activity of\r\nthese institutions. We consider, however, that their\r\nfinancial resources should be increased and the\r\nmanagement of resources should be more efficient. We\r\nwelcome the actions undertaken by the UNDP\r\nAdministrator, reflected in the Administrator’s business\r\nplans, and those of the Executive Secretary of the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe,\r\nmeant to enhance the efficiency of the activities and\r\nresource management of these important institutions.\r\nWe consider that the establishment of strong positions\r\nregarding development policies, through an\r\nunderstanding of the characteristic conditions and\r\nspecific needs of countries, would contribute\r\nsignificantly to the Organization’s reaching its goals in\r\nthis domain.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council lies at the\r\nheart of the general reform of the United Nations. It\r\nshould be guided by the principles of equitable\r\ngeographic representation, democracy, effectiveness,\r\nefficiency and transparency. It is on this foundation\r\nthat we can modernize the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil and bring it into line with the substantial\r\nincrease in the general membership of the United\r\nNations since 1963, the year of the only previous\r\nreform of the Council. The Republic of Moldova\r\npronounces itself in favour of a moderate enlargement\r\nof the Council’s composition and of a reasonable\r\nincrease in the number of permanent and non-\r\npermanent members which would correspond to the\r\nprinciple of fair geographical distribution and ensure\r\nan adequate balance between the industrialized and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nOur country also welcomes the process of\r\nrevitalization and improvement of the General\r\nAssembly’s efficiency and, at the same time, supports\r\nthe idea of restoring the central role of the Assembly as\r\nthe debating and main representative body of the\r\nUnited Nations. We consider that it is necessary to\r\ncontinue the efforts to consolidate the coordinating\r\nfunctions of the Economic and Social Council\r\nregarding United Nations funds and programmes.\r\nUnder existing conditions it is clear that United\r\nNations reform will continue successfully only if the\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nfinancial problems affecting the Organization’s\r\nactivities are solved. We support the proposals aimed at\r\nthe reform of the United Nations scales of assessments,\r\nincluding the peacekeeping scale, taking into\r\nconsideration the payment capacity of each State.\r\nDespite the difficulties it faces, my country makes\r\nevery effort to reduce its United Nations budget\r\narrears.\r\nThe evolution of the situation in the international\r\narena in the past 55 years calls for imposes a new\r\nvision and a redefinition of the concrete mechanisms\r\nfor realizing the fundamental objectives of the\r\nOrganization, which spring essentially from the\r\nfounding philosophy of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. In this respect, the Organization should draw\r\nconclusions from its own past and, relying on\r\npermanent support from States, should accomplish new\r\ntasks from the perspective of adapting to the\r\nimperatives of time. We express our hope that the\r\nUnited Nations, which remains indispensable for the\r\ninternational community in the twenty-first century,\r\nwill be able to impose a positive direction on this\r\nevolution.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Lee Joung-binn, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nTrade of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Lee Joung-binn (Republic of Korea): It\r\ngives me great delight and honour to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s first session of the new\r\nmillennium. I would like to begin by conveying my\r\nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of this historic session, the success of\r\nwhich is ensured, I believe, by the experience and\r\nwisdom you bring to this noble work. I would also like\r\nto pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, whose dedication and\r\nleadership enabled the fifty-fourth session to lay the\r\ngroundwork for the Millennium Assembly.\r\nI also take this opportunity to warmly welcome\r\nthe admission of Tuvalu to the United Nations.\r\nTwo weeks ago world leaders, including my\r\nPresident, gathered in this very place to rally the\r\npolitical will of the international community to meet\r\nthe challenges of the new millennium. Their meeting of\r\nminds here in this Hall of peace, as summed up in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, reaffirmed the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as the embodiment of humankind’s\r\naspiration to greater peace and prosperity, to be\r\nstrengthened and fulfilled through the efforts of all\r\nMember States.\r\nIt is only right that the new millennium should\r\nstart with the beginning of the end of the confrontation\r\nand conflicts handed down from the past era. Such a\r\nstart has been made on the Korean peninsula with the\r\nfirst South-North Korean summit meeting in June. As a\r\nresult, inter-Korean relations have taken a definite turn\r\nfor the better. The whole world stands to benefit from\r\nthe liquidation of the final legacy of the cold war that\r\nthe summit appears to have set in motion on the Korean\r\npeninsula.\r\nDuring the June summit the two leaders engaged\r\nin an extensive discussion on peace on the Korean\r\npeninsula, South-North economic cooperation and the\r\nfuture of the Korean people. At the end, they\r\nannounced a five-point joint declaration committing\r\nthe top leaders of the two sides to steering inter-Korean\r\nrelations away from tension and enmity towards\r\nreconciliation, peaceful coexistence and co-prosperity\r\nand eventual unification.\r\nThe summit is being followed up with inter-\r\nKorean ministerial meetings to work out concrete steps\r\nto implement the summit agreements. Some steps have\r\nalready been taken, such as the reopening of the liaison\r\noffices at the truce village of Panmunjom and several\r\nsociocultural exchange programmes. Some are in the\r\nmaking — the work to reconnect the railroad between\r\nthe two sides and the negotiation of the necessary legal\r\ninstruments for full-scale economic exchanges, such as\r\nagreements on investment guarantees, avoidance of\r\ndouble taxation, settlement procedures and dispute\r\narbitration. The third ministerial round is to be held\r\nlater this month on Cheju island of South Korea.\r\nIn the latest development the two sides have\r\nagreed on a return visit to the South by Chairman Kim\r\nJong Il at an early date. Furthermore, in a key move for\r\ntension reduction, a South-North defence ministers’\r\nmeeting is to be held on 25 and 26 September, also on\r\nCheju island.\r\nEach of these developments stirs the hearts and\r\nminds of the Korean people. But none would match the\r\nprofound emotions that were aroused in mid-August by\r\nthe exchange of visits in Seoul and Pyongyang by\r\nfamilies that have suffered the unprecedented\r\nhumanitarian plight of remaining separated for half a\r\ncentury. It was a limited exchange involving only 100\r\nindividuals from each side, out of an estimated 10\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nmillion members of families torn apart by the national\r\ndivision. But further exchanges are in the planning, as\r\nare more lasting solutions to their plight.\r\nAs dramatic and hopeful as the June summit and\r\nthe inter-Korean developments since then have been,\r\nonly the first steps have been taken in the long process\r\nof ending the cold war and establishing a lasting peace\r\non the Korean peninsula. We sincerely seek the abiding\r\ninterest and support of the international community to\r\nsee us through. In this regard, I should like to express\r\nmy Government’s wholehearted appreciation of the\r\nstatement by the Co-Chairpersons of the Millennium\r\nSummit welcoming the inter-Korean summit and the\r\nfollow-up measures.\r\nAt the dawn of a new millennium the United\r\nNations has yet to resolve the old problems of violent\r\nconflicts that are worsening in both scope and nature.\r\nIn many parts of the world, countless lives continue to\r\nbe lost in armed conflicts, insurgencies and ethnic\r\nviolence at regional, subregional, and intra-national\r\nlevels. We, as Member States, have to rally a stronger\r\npolitical will to prevent a repetition of these tragedies\r\nthat have happened or are happening in Rwanda,\r\nKosovo, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo.\r\nIt is particularly deplorable that United Nations\r\npersonnel in the field are under growing, violent attack.\r\nWe urge all parties concerned to guarantee the safety\r\nand security of the peacekeeping, humanitarian and\r\nother United Nations personnel. In this regard we\r\nwelcome the Brahimi report as providing a useful basis\r\nfor improving the effectiveness of the peacekeeping\r\noperations activities with an adequate mandate and\r\nresources.\r\nMy Government remains fully committed to\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions. Last year, in\r\nsupport of the democratic aspiration of a people, the\r\nRepublic of Korea sent an infantry battalion to East\r\nTimor. Furthermore, with the economy regaining a\r\ngrowth momentum, we are taking steps to fulfil our\r\npledge of an increase in our contribution to the\r\npeacekeeping operations budget. This is an expression\r\nof our firm belief that in the twenty-first century the\r\nUnited Nations should be better prepared and more\r\nwilling to fulfil its responsibility for international\r\npeace and security.\r\nMany leaders at the Millennium Summit spoke of\r\nthe double-edged nature of the globalizing world,\r\nwhich brings unprecedented opportunities for\r\neconomic growth on the one hand, while it further\r\nwidens the disparities between the developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, on the other. Aggravated by the\r\ndigital divide of the information age, the wealth gap\r\ncan become a source of unrest and instability in the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has actively taken on the\r\nchallenges of globalization. At home we have turned\r\nthe recent economic crisis into an opportunity to gear\r\nup for the knowledge-based economy of the global\r\ninformation age. We knew that we must emerge from\r\nthe crisis not simply as we were before the crisis but in\r\na new form fit to thrive in the age of information\r\nindustries and borderless competition. Thus, bold\r\nreforms have been under way to rid the economy of\r\npast inefficiencies and to accelerate liberalization and\r\nmarket opening. Active Government assistance has\r\nbeen rendered to small and medium-venture businesses\r\nin the information sector, as well as to educating the\r\npeople in computer literacy.\r\nGovernment policies have combined with the\r\nintellectual vigour and adventurous spirit of the Korean\r\npeople to produce the world’s fastest growing Internet\r\npopulation \u001f an estimated 20 million users by the end\r\nof the year out of a population of 43 million, almost 50\r\nper cent of our entire population. While actively\r\npromoting the information age, we have also given\r\nspecial attention and care to those pockets of society\r\nthat would fall further behind without help. Our efforts\r\nin this area have been built around the concept of\r\n“productive welfare”, which aims at enabling the\r\nsocially weak and enhancing the living standards of all.\r\nA key operative term is human resources development,\r\nwhich offers training and education to all who are\r\nwilling to work.\r\nWe believe that the same concept of enabling the\r\nweak to develop their capacities should be applied in\r\ninternational development assistance. Thus, on the\r\noccasion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\r\n(APEC) Forum on Shared Prosperity and Harmony in\r\nSeoul in March this year, our President, Kim Dae-jung,\r\nurged donors to support the developing countries in\r\ntheir efforts to set up information centres which would\r\nprovide communities with access to the Internet and\r\nother conveniences of the information age. I am very\r\nhappy that the proposal is entirely consistent with the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative on the United Nations\r\nInformation Technology Service (UNITeS). In addition,\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nmy Government is increasing its assistance for human\r\nresources development in the developing economies\r\nthrough the dispatch of experts and invitations to\r\ntrainees in the information and telecommunication\r\nfields. In particular, in collaboration with the United\r\nNations, we have offered training opportunities to\r\nexperts from African countries in export promotion.\r\nWe will continue to strengthen cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations to address the mounting challenges that\r\nAfrica faces.\r\nShared values and ideals make for the strongest\r\nof the bonds that enable nations to work together\r\nbeyond differences in history, ethnicity and socio-\r\neconomic development. In this regard, the spread of\r\ndemocracy and its values in the post-cold-war era has\r\ngreatly enriched the grounds for the global community\r\nto build a world of durable peace and prosperity and of\r\ndignity for all human beings. While upholding human\r\nrights and democratic values at home, democracies\r\nshould cooperate to promote their universality in the\r\nglobal community. Thus, the Republic of Korea was\r\nhappy to serve as a co-convenor for the first\r\ninternational conference of the Community of\r\nDemocracies in Warsaw last June, and we are honoured\r\nthat Korea will host the second international\r\nconference of the Community of Democracies in\r\nOctober 2002.\r\nMeanwhile, to strengthen democracy at home, my\r\nGovernment has continued the endeavour to improve\r\nhuman rights laws and practices. At present we are in\r\nthe process of enacting a comprehensive human rights\r\nlaw, which will give birth to a national human rights\r\ncommission. The commission will work to improve\r\ninstitutional arrangements for the promotion of human\r\nrights and to raise public awareness. We are also\r\nmaking significant progress in enhancing the rights of\r\nwomen and children as well as workers. Particularly\r\nnoteworthy is the creation of the Ministry of Women,\r\ndue within this year, to advance gender equality.\r\nAs the new millennium opens, the challenges\r\nfacing the United Nations are multifaceted and ever-\r\ndiversifying. I have mentioned a few. There are many\r\nmore issues, such as disarmament and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, that are equally important. However, the\r\nresources of the global body remain limited. Ongoing\r\nreform is required to enable the United Nations to meet\r\nthe challenges with greater efficiency and\r\neffectiveness. Thanks to the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative, considerable achievements have been made\r\nto streamline the Organization, but there are still areas\r\nwhere creative input is called for. Security Council\r\nreform is one of those areas. We believe that\r\nrepresentativeness, transparency and effectiveness must\r\nbe the guiding terms in the debate for a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Council.\r\nWe do not need new concepts to describe the\r\nchallenges of the new millennium. They are still the\r\nproblems of peace and prosperity and the right of\r\nhuman beings to live with dignity. However,\r\nglobalization has increased the intensity of the\r\nproblems as well as the chances for their resolution.\r\nTherefore, the role of the United Nations must also be\r\nconsolidated. The Government of the Republic of\r\nKorea is prepared to play an active role commensurate\r\nwith its abilities to accomplish the common goals of\r\nthe global community. I sincerely hope that this body\r\nwill lead the way in putting the lofty spirit of the\r\nMillennium Declaration into action. In the process, my\r\ncountry, the Republic of Korea, heartened by the\r\nenhanced hope for its peaceful and prosperous future,\r\nwill play an active part.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Panama, His Excellency\r\nMr. José Miguel Alemán Healy.\r\nMr. Alemán Healy (Panama) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me to convey to you, Mr. President, the warm\r\ncongratulations of Her Excellency, Mireya Moscoso,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama, together with\r\nthose of her Government and the people of my country,\r\non your election to serve as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. Your designation to\r\nguide the debates in this forum is highly gratifying to\r\nthe Panamanian delegation, not only because of your\r\nown brilliant political record and your well-known\r\ndevotion to the well-being of the Finnish people, but\r\nalso because of the noble way in which you here\r\nrepresent the lofty ideals of sovereignty and universal\r\ncooperation in pursuit of world peace, sustainable\r\nhuman development, human rights, democracy and\r\njustice — traditional mainstays of Finland’s foreign\r\npolicy and of the activities of the United Nations.\r\nPanama shares with so many other States Members of\r\nthe Organization your concern to put these ideals into\r\npractice, and that is what I shall be addressing today in\r\nmy statement.\r\nI am also glad to pay tribute to, and express my\r\ngratitude for, the activities of the Secretary-General,\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who has devoted particular effort in\r\nthe last year to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, the reform of the Organization, and the\r\npromotion of human rights, gender equality and the\r\nenjoyment of the rights of the child. Panama shares\r\nthese and other concerns of the Secretary-General.\r\nIndeed, as the other members of the Ibero-American\r\ncommunity are aware, upon an initiative of President\r\nMireya Moscoso announced at Havana in November\r\nlast year, the next Summit of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of Ibero-America, which will take place\r\nshortly in Panama, will be dedicated to discussing the\r\nproblems facing children and young people in our\r\nregion. In the preparations for this meeting, which\r\nPanama has undertaken with the greatest enthusiasm,\r\nthe national Government has received the support of\r\norganizations devoted to the well-being of the world’s\r\nchildren and young people. These include the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) — a United\r\nNations agency which has selected Panama as its new\r\nregional headquarters and to whose noteworthy\r\nactivities, in fulfilment of its mandate, I am glad to pay\r\ntribute on this occasion — together with agencies\r\nresponsible for promoting culture, particularly the\r\nculture of peace, including the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), another United Nations agency which has\r\ndone extremely valuable work in promoting universal\r\nunderstanding through education, technology and\r\ncommunication.\r\nWith respect to gender equality, we are glad to be\r\nable to state that in recent years our country has made\r\nsignificant progress, particularly with respect to the\r\npolitical participation of women. Indeed, since\r\n1 September last year a woman has guided the destiny\r\nof our nation. From January this year our Supreme\r\nCourt of Justice has been presided over by a woman.\r\nDuring the review conference on women held in the\r\ncontext of the special session of the General Assembly\r\nin June 2000, the delegation of Panama signed the\r\nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination\r\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which\r\nmakes it possible to have recourse to an international\r\nbody in case of the denial of such rights. Furthermore,\r\nPanama has made significant improvements in access\r\nfor women to education and health. However, much\r\nstill remains to be done, particularly with respect to\r\nequal access to economic resources. In this area, which\r\nis closely bound up with sustainable human\r\ndevelopment, my country hopes to make significant\r\nadvances, particularly through international\r\ncooperation.\r\nOn this point, international cooperation, I should\r\nlike to share some brief thoughts and place them before\r\nthis distinguished body for consideration. More than 40\r\nyears ago one of my predecessors in the post of\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Miguel J. Moreno,\r\naddressed this General Assembly on the topic of\r\ninternational cooperation for development. On that\r\noccasion Minister Moreno stated:\r\n“Economic development, and international\r\ncooperation for the attainment of such\r\ndevelopment, are not only necessary if world\r\npeace is to be achieved, but also represent\r\nimportant means of cementing it and making it\r\ndurable.” (A/PV.749, para. 176)\r\nDr. Moreno added:\r\n“Social tranquillity and national political stability\r\ndepend on economic development and on the\r\nbenefits which the peoples derive therefrom, as\r\ndo also a better understanding among the nations\r\nand international harmony; all these are\r\nindispensable for world peace.” (A/PV.749,\r\npara. 178)\r\nThese wise words are as true today as they were\r\nwhen they were uttered at the thirteenth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1958. It is this wisdom that has\r\nguided the renewed emphasis that the United Nations,\r\nin the last decade and through its United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), has placed on the\r\npromotion of sustainable human development. This\r\nconcept is the axis and basis of our President’s\r\ngovernmental plan. Our Government recognizes that\r\nwithout measures to promote human development,\r\neconomic growth can make no sense and have no\r\nmeaning.\r\nAlthough it may be boosted by economic growth,\r\nhuman development is much more than economic\r\ngrowth, for human development means enhancing the\r\ncapacities of human beings as individuals and as\r\nmembers of the community by measures that provide\r\naccess to emancipating education and to better health\r\nand transport services, measures to permit participation\r\nin an economy and a culture that respects human\r\ndignity, that encourage the prudent use of natural\r\nresources, and foster and enlarge the exercise of the\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nfundamental duties and rights of the human individual.\r\nGiven this multidimensional nature and the\r\nPanamanian Government’s concern to work towards\r\nsustainable human development and to promote human\r\nrights, the Panamanian delegation expresses its\r\nsatisfaction at the contents of the latest UNDP human\r\ndevelopment report, which considers the link between\r\nhuman rights and human development. The report\r\nexplains that human freedom is the common purpose\r\nand the common motivation of human rights and\r\nhuman development.\r\nMr. Aboulhasan (Kuwait), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn the years that have elapsed since our return to\r\nconstitutional government our country has made\r\nsignificant advances. Under our Government we have\r\nbegun a process of repealing legislation that restricts\r\nfreedom of expression and we have invited the Inter-\r\nAmerican Commission on Human Rights, a significant\r\nregional agency, to assist us in promoting the\r\nenjoyment of human rights in Panama. Also recently,\r\nthrough a process of cooperation involving the major\r\npolitical movements in the country, we have adopted\r\nby consensus the basic elements of a Panamanian\r\nsecurity policy based on the doctrine of human\r\nsecurity, an extremely important component of\r\nsustainable human development. That doctrine upholds\r\nindividual and grass-roots communities as constant,\r\nclear-cut points of reference for the responsibilities and\r\npurposes of the State’s security strategy, and is based\r\non taking preventive measures designed to reduce\r\nvulnerabilities and minimize the risks threatening the\r\nopportunities and rights of individuals and of\r\ncommunities. I am particularly gratified to be able to\r\nstate that Panama is one of the few countries to have\r\nadopted the human security doctrine as a State policy.\r\nWe hope that this will be a matter for more in-depth\r\ndiscussion and analysis at the next Summit of the\r\nAmericas to be held in June 2001 in Quebec, Canada.\r\nIn the context of this and other aspects of\r\nsustainable human development and the exercise of\r\nhuman rights, Panama firmly believes in international\r\ncooperation and has recourse to it in order to promote\r\nthe lofty objectives that are the inspiration for States\r\nMembers of the United Nations. At the recent\r\nMillennium Summit, whose purpose was to set a clear\r\ncourse for the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury, Panama, among other things, called for States\r\nMembers to return to the pursuit of the original spirit\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Pursuant to this\r\nrequest, it is our hope that the members of the Security\r\nCouncil will assume the obligation of representing the\r\ngeneral interests of the international community instead\r\nof acting according to their individual strategic military\r\nor political interests. The general interest of the\r\nMembers of the Organization indicates that the time\r\nhas come to engage in debate and reach some\r\nconclusion as to the way in which we can expand the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council while restricting and regulating\r\nthe use of the veto. We have expressed our agreement\r\nwith the need to reform the Charter of the United\r\nNations in order to achieve this objective and others,\r\nprovided such reform is based on the principles of\r\ndemocracy and equitable geographic participation.\r\nPanama wishes here and now to reaffirm its\r\ncommitment to the principle of self-determination of\r\npeoples, articulated in the Charter of the United\r\nNations, and to the use of mechanisms for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts. The dangerous disputes which\r\nriddle and split our world from the China Sea to the\r\nMagreb, and which may degenerate into domestic or\r\ntransboundary outbreaks of violence, must be\r\naddressed with a sense of urgency by the United\r\nNations. This would be possible within a structured,\r\nconflict-prevention programme that provided for\r\nspecialized support to nations to guide them and assist\r\nthem in a fair and orderly, peaceful negotiation of their\r\ninterests. Accordingly, we recommend recourse to the\r\nmoral and technical presence of the United Nations\r\nwithin such processes, engaged in by small States beset\r\nby hostile Powers, or by racial or religious\r\nintolerances. Likewise, we recommend recourse to the\r\nUnited Nations in support of negotiations on\r\nreunification or self-determination that other people\r\nmay wish to embark upon, with the aim of preserving a\r\nprosperous, democratic way of life or of securing for\r\nthemselves the benefits of development.\r\nThe Republic of Panama nowadays is a fully\r\nsovereign State glad to have recovered the exercise of\r\nsovereignty throughout its national territory, and to\r\nhave proved its resolve and ability to fulfil the\r\ncommitments stemming from its participation in this\r\ngreat international community. Panama has the will and\r\nthe capacity not only to administer efficiently and\r\ntransparently its greatest asset, the Panama Canal, but\r\nalso to cope successfully with the growing demands for\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\ninternational maritime traffic and to ensure the security\r\nof our inter-oceanic waterway.\r\nThe Canal and the reverted lands will be the\r\ndriving force behind the development of the\r\nPanamanian economy in coming years. Among other\r\nlarge-scale projects, we are now executing the\r\nextension of the Culebra Cut, a $1 billion investment\r\nthat, once completed in the year 2001, will permit\r\nsimultaneous passage of Panamax vessels through this\r\nsection of the Canal. Once this work is completed,\r\nprojects will be begun to expand the Canal’s water\r\nbasin. Moreover, consultations and studies are under\r\nway with a view to building the third set of locks,\r\nwhich will make it possible for the inter-oceanic\r\nwaterway to be used by post-Panamax vessels and will\r\nincrease the efficiency of the Canal by 25 per cent. All\r\nthis will benefit world trade. Lastly, in the coming year\r\nbidding will be opened for the construction of a second\r\nbridge over the Canal in order to help unite our land,\r\nwhich is currently divided by the Canal.\r\nIn the lands recovered and now devoted to\r\nnational development, former military installations of\r\nall kinds have been expertly retooled for commercial\r\ncivilian use. Among other things, the former Albrook\r\nair base has become a centre for domestic air and land\r\ntransport; the former School of the Americas has been\r\nconverted into a hotel of the Meliá international chain,\r\nwith its own convention centre; the Coco Solo military\r\nbase, which enjoys a unique location at the Atlantic\r\nmouth of the Canal, today houses the international\r\nmaritime cargo ports of Manzanillo and Coco Solo,\r\nwhich complement the international port of Balboa on\r\nthe Pacific, all interconnected by a trans-isthmus rail\r\nsystem for container transport; and in the forts of\r\nDavis, Corozal and Cocolí, processing centres are now\r\nbeing developed for exports, with the backing of\r\ninternational capital.\r\nWith input from the International Financial\r\nCorporation, studies are being undertaken to convert\r\nthe Howard air base into a multifunctional air and sea\r\ncargo centre for the Pacific side of the Canal. The\r\ndevelopment of the Sherman base, which is a genuine\r\necological gem, seeks to link the protection of the\r\ncountry’s historical patrimony and environment with\r\neconomic development. Fort Clayton is now the base\r\nof an educational and industrial complex known as the\r\nCity of Knowledge, where the regional office of the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for the\r\nhemisphere will be located. The City of Knowledge is\r\nalso home to regional campuses of Texas A \u0026 M and\r\nMcGill Universities and a continental-level regional\r\ncentre for human rights. All of this will contribute to\r\nthe Government’s plan to make Panama a centre of\r\ninternational agencies.\r\nIn order to take full advantage of international\r\ncooperation, Panama has adopted a policy of\r\nstrengthening its links with the various major\r\ninternational organizations, including those that are\r\npart of the United Nations system. In this way we are\r\nstriving to move forward and contribute to worldwide\r\npeacemaking by converting former military bases into\r\ncivilian and commercial areas that will enhance world\r\npeace.\r\nThis is an appropriate occasion to place on record\r\nthat Panama categorically rejects the actions of the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD), which has unilaterally devised\r\ntaxation standards that its members are trying to\r\nimpose outside their jurisdiction, in open violation of\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly. On this point,\r\nPanama is grateful for the support of the majority\r\nleader of the United States House of Representatives,\r\nwho on 7 September wrote to the United States\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr. Lawrence Summers,\r\nstrongly condemning this action. There is a need for a\r\ncareful examination of the flight of billions of dollars\r\nin capital from developing countries to the financial\r\ninstitutions of the first world which are trying to\r\ntighten the so-called qualifications that are used to\r\nexert pressure, with obvious objectives.\r\nPanama is committed to the fight against the\r\nlaundering of money stemming from drug trafficking\r\nand other unlawful activities. We believe that all\r\ncountries should work together to eliminate this\r\nscourge. This effort should be carried out through\r\nlegitimate mechanisms of international institutions that\r\nare representative not only of the industrialized North\r\nbut also of the emerging countries of the South, such as\r\nthe United Nations and the various regional\r\norganizations.\r\nIn the spirit of international cooperation, to which\r\nI previously referred, and in consideration of the most\r\nbasic concepts of justice, we are today calling for the\r\ncooperation of the General Assembly in resolving a\r\ndispute between Panama and the United States of\r\nAmerica, as a result of the bases operated by the armed\r\nforces of that country on our territory throughout the\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nlast century. In this forum, in September last year, our\r\nPresident stressed her confidence that the outstanding\r\ndifferences surrounding this issue that still persisted\r\nbetween Panama and the United States would be\r\nresolved satisfactorily in a reasonable period of time.\r\nUnfortunately, despite the efforts and goodwill\r\ndisplayed by the Panamanian Government these\r\ndifferences have still not been settled.\r\nIn his powerful report entitled “We the peoples:\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury”, and with respect to certain matters relating to\r\ntrade, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, proposes\r\nthat States Members follow a line of conduct consonant\r\nwith environmental and human rights standards. He\r\nalso urges States to fulfil their obligations vis-à-vis\r\nuniversal values and the common standards that have\r\nemerged from countless conferences and extensive\r\nnegotiations and that have taken the form of historic\r\nresolutions and conventions under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations. By extension, we believe that this\r\nappeal to States applies not only to trading matters but\r\nalso to all the other aspects of relationships among\r\nnations. His profound words express the vast ethical\r\nfoundation of the United Nations.\r\nIn another part of his report the Secretary-General\r\nwarns of the risk that environmental degradation,\r\namong other factors, may heighten social and political\r\ntensions in an unforeseeable and potentially dangerous\r\nfashion. We are particularly gratified by this clear\r\nvision on an issue whose various facets are already\r\nhaving a serious impact not only on many developing\r\nnations but also on the most developed.\r\nIn view of these very wise appeals and warnings,\r\nas well as of the predominant role that the United\r\nNations plays in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand defence of the principle of sovereignty, in a formal\r\nnote, to the Secretary-General I have requested him to\r\nbring to the attention of the United Nations the failure\r\nof the United States of America to fulfil its obligations\r\nso that the Organization can assist in bringing about an\r\nearly resolution of the dispute arising from the refusal\r\nof the United States to fulfil the commitments derived\r\nfrom the unauthorized military use by its army of\r\nsignificant portions of Panama’s national territory. I\r\nhave informed the Secretary-General of the facts and\r\nformally requested that my note be circulated as a\r\ndocument of the General Assembly and that it be\r\nbrought to the attention of the Security Council.\r\nI take this opportunity to wish the General\r\nAssembly a fruitful year of deliberations under the\r\nguidance of its President. I should like to express my\r\nsincere hope that this year will be one of significant,\r\nmeaningful and tangible achievements for the\r\nOrganization in the treatment of the most important\r\nitems on its agenda, to the benefit of all mankind.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I now call on His Excellency Mr. Alwi\r\nShihab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Shihab (Indonesia): It gives me great\r\npleasure to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his assumption\r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfifth session. I am confident that under his most able\r\nguidance we will make substantive progress in our\r\ndeliberations. I also pay tribute to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the esteemed Foreign Minister\r\nof Namibia, for the skilful manner in which he guided\r\nour work during a busy year.\r\nI also take this opportunity to commend the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization. I also take this occasion\r\nto welcome the new Member, Tuvalu, to our midst.\r\nThe fifty-fifth session opened with the historic\r\nMillennium Summit and the adoption of a visionary\r\nDeclaration offering the cardinal principles that should\r\ngovern relations among nations. It charted a course\r\nthat, if followed, will ensure durable peace and security\r\nas well as common progress and prosperity for all\r\nhumanity. It, hopefully, began a new chapter in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations. Undeniably, expectations\r\nare raised that the Organization will overcome the\r\npervasive and interrelated obstacles to peace and\r\ndevelopment, while strongly reaffirming and\r\npreserving the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter. We know that these goals can be\r\nachieved, but it is crucial that Member States, civil\r\nsociety, international organizations and the private\r\nsector cooperate and work together for that purpose.\r\nThese efforts must be supported by the\r\nempowerment of the Organization, entailing more than\r\ncharting a new structure and new mechanisms, or\r\nproviding additional resources. It demands a\r\nwillingness to provide genuine authority and\r\nlegitimacy to the United Nations by setting new norms\r\nand agendas as needed. It also urgently calls for reform\r\nof the Security Council. New prospects for that effort\r\nmay have emerged in the joint statement of the Heads\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nof State or Government of the permanent members of\r\nthe Council on 7 September. In that statement they\r\npledged to foster a more transparent and broadly\r\nrepresentative Council to enhance its effectiveness for\r\npeace and security.\r\nOne major issue confronting us is the lack of\r\nprogress on the elimination of nuclear weapons. We are\r\neven more concerned to see a new rationalization for\r\ntheir continued use, coupled with repeated assertions of\r\ntheir legitimacy and necessity, and to see the danger of\r\nthe deployment of anti-ballistic missile defence\r\nsystems. This lack of progress increases the prospects\r\nof a new nuclear arms race which will threaten the\r\nexisting arms control agreements and the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Ridding\r\nthe world of the dangers posed by nuclear weapons,\r\npending their total abolition, is the greatest challenge\r\nof our time.\r\nIn contributing to peace and security, Indonesia\r\nhas since 1957 actively participated in and contributed\r\nto the various peacekeeping operations of the United\r\nNations. In anticipating the new and emerging\r\nproblems identified by the Secretary-General and, in\r\nparticular, the report (A/55/305) of the Brahimi panel,\r\nwe are in the process of responding to the new\r\nrequirements with a view to bolstering the numbers,\r\nquality and effectiveness of our participation in future\r\nUnited Nations missions.\r\nArmed conflict and tensions persist in many parts\r\nof the world. In the Middle East we must continue to\r\nfocus our attention on the core of the conflict, namely,\r\nthe legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people to\r\nsecure their inalienable rights to self-determination and\r\nsovereign statehood in their own homeland, with\r\nJerusalem as its capital. In this context, my delegation\r\ncommends the Palestinian leaders for their\r\nstatesmanlike approach. They have demonstrated their\r\ncommitment to peace through the decision to share the\r\ncity of Jerusalem, while remaining committed to their\r\nnational rights, in order to reach a compromise. Hence,\r\nit behoves Israel to make a similar compromise so that\r\na final settlement can be achieved. The withdrawal of\r\nIsrael last June from southern Lebanon, following more\r\nthan two decades of occupation, has finally restored the\r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon within\r\nits internationally recognized boundaries. My\r\ndelegation also hopes for a resumption of the Israeli-\r\nSyrian peace talks, based on the Madrid peace formula.\r\nIn various regions of the world, however, we see\r\nmany positive developments which reflect a new spirit\r\nof cooperation and compromise. These are exemplified\r\nby, among other things, the summit meeting of the two\r\nleaders of North and South Korea, the formation of a\r\nnew Government in Somalia, and the ceasefire\r\nagreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is my\r\ndelegation’s expectation that the same spirit of\r\ncooperation and compromise will prevail in easing the\r\nimpact of sanctions on the people of Iraq. It is also an\r\nimperative on humanitarian grounds to address the\r\nissue of missing persons of the parties concerned\r\nduring the Gulf war.\r\nIn the afterglow of the Millennium Summit and\r\nthe first South Summit, which took place in August in\r\nHavana, there was a distinct sense of optimism that the\r\nenormous power and promise of globalization and the\r\ninformation revolution could be harnessed in the\r\nservice of development and in combating poverty. In\r\nthis regard, the declarations and programmes of action\r\nprovide us with an excellent blueprint for charting the\r\npath ahead. Today, particularly in the developing\r\ncountries, millions remain untouched by the benefits of\r\nglobalization and the information revolution and, being\r\nbypassed and marginalized, can greatly provoke\r\ninstability. Thus, rather than enjoying generalized\r\npeace and prosperity, the world at the turn of the\r\ncentury continues to be disfigured by ruthless conflicts,\r\nwrenching poverty, blatant inequalities and problems\r\nincluding hunger, illiteracy and disease. While\r\ndeclarations and programmes of action are of critical\r\nimportance for changing this reality, their\r\nimplementation is the key. I am convinced that there\r\ncan be no alternative to productive dialogue to achieve\r\nthis aim; such dialogue must be based on mutual\r\ninterests and benefits, shared responsibility and\r\ngenuine partnership.\r\nOne of the core issues of development on which\r\nglobalization has had a great impact and which requires\r\nsuch dialogue is that of financing for development, an\r\nissue that has assumed immense importance in the new\r\nglobal economy. While enormous financial flows have\r\ncharacterized the global financial system, the basic\r\nproblem for the majority of developing countries is that\r\nthey are not in a position to benefit from such flows\r\nand must instead depend on official development\r\nassistance, which has sharply declined. Hence the\r\nimportance of the forthcoming international high-level\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nevent on financing for development that is to be held in\r\n2001.\r\nAnother area in which globalization has had a\r\ngreat impact, one closely associated with financing for\r\ndevelopment, is the issue of the indebtedness of the\r\ndeveloping countries which often seriously undermines\r\ntheir development efforts, particularly in this era of\r\nglobalization. Regrettably, the numerous debt strategies\r\nand initiatives employed over the years have failed to\r\nresolve this problem.\r\nEqually important in this age of information is the\r\nneed to harness the potential of the information and\r\ncommunication technologies in the service of\r\ndevelopment. Progress was made in placing this critical\r\nissue on the agenda of the United Nations when for the\r\nfirst time the high-level segment of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council this year considered information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICT) for development as\r\nits major theme. The outcome, particularly the\r\nministerial declaration, underlined the critical\r\nimportance of unlocking the vast potential of\r\ninformation and communication technologies for all\r\nhumanity.\r\nMore than ever before, due largely to\r\nglobalization, we must strive for sustainable\r\ndevelopment as set out in Agenda 21, adopted in Rio\r\nde Janeiro in 1992. The outcome of that Conference\r\ncommitted the international community to meet the\r\neconomic needs of the present generation without\r\ncompromising the ability of the planet to provide for\r\nthe needs of future generations. But almost a decade\r\nlater, with the exception of a number of conventions\r\nthat have been enacted, relatively little has been\r\nachieved in fully implementing Agenda 21, known as\r\nRio+10. It is therefore important that we seriously\r\nprepare for the ten-year review of its implementation.\r\nIn doing so we should be able to generate the highest\r\npolitical commitment to help to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of the Agenda. In this regard, I am\r\npleased to inform the Assembly that Indonesia’s offer\r\nto host Rio+10 has been strongly supported by the\r\nMinisterial Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment of Asia and the Pacific.\r\nOnly a short time ago the five-year reviews were\r\nheld on the Copenhagen conference on social\r\ndevelopment and the Beijing conference on women.\r\nFrom those two special sessions we learned valuable\r\nlessons. We learned that for many people social\r\ndevelopment remains an elusive goal and that only\r\nthrough gender equality and women’s empowerment\r\ncan true prosperity be achieved.\r\nClearly the time has come to move beyond\r\nrhetoric and fully implement the commitments of the\r\nvarious international conferences of the 1990s. We\r\nmust also work towards eradicating ethnic and racial\r\ndiscrimination, religious intolerance and xenophobia,\r\nwhich threaten to undermine all progress — political,\r\neconomic and social. The forthcoming World\r\nConference against Racism in 2001 therefore presents\r\nan opportunity that must be seized.\r\nWe are committed to ensuring that humanitarian\r\nassistance is available wherever and whenever needed\r\nthroughout the world. The plight of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons must continue to hold a prominent\r\nposition on the global agenda, with each nation\r\nmeeting its responsibilities to render aid and assistance\r\nin times of natural disaster, civil conflict or other\r\nemergency situations.\r\nWe must work also to ensure the integrity of\r\nhumanitarian missions. The murder of staff of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) in Atambua, West Timor, has\r\nshocked and saddened the world, and nowhere more\r\nthan Indonesia. That humanitarian workers should\r\nbecome victims in the performance of their work is\r\nunacceptable. Let me be clear in stating that this crime\r\nshould not go unpunished. The necessary measures\r\nmust be taken to ensure that such a heinous crime is\r\nnever again repeated. This tragedy should not,\r\nhowever, result in a withdrawal of humanitarian\r\nassistance, thus compounding the loss. We should work\r\ntogether to resolve any and all obstacles to the safe\r\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance.\r\nInternational cooperation in the millennium is\r\nunavoidable and indispensable. The quality, extent and\r\ntimeliness of such cooperation will make the difference\r\nbetween despair and progress. In this setting, the\r\nsignificance of the United Nations should be evident\r\nand accepted. Preserving the role of the Organization\r\nrequires the participation of all Member States, large\r\nand small. Beyond declarations, it is time to translate\r\nour ideas into action. Achievement is required in the\r\ntwenty-first century. That was the message of the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Modibo Sidibé,\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Mali and for Malians\r\nAbroad.\r\nMr. Sidibé (Mali) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset I should like to congratulate the President most\r\nwarmly on his election to preside over the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. I take the\r\nopportunity to assure him of my delegation’s full\r\nsupport as he carries out his difficult but uplifting task.\r\nI feel sure that with his experience and abilities as an\r\nable diplomat he will successfully guide our\r\ndiscussions.\r\nI should also like to extend my sincere and warm\r\ncongratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for\r\nthe ability and authority he demonstrated throughout\r\nthe fifty-fourth session.\r\nI also take this opportunity of extending once\r\nagain to Secretary-General Kofi Annan our full\r\nappreciation and support for his constant efforts and\r\nresolve to find a better world in spite of the many\r\ncomplex challenges in the new millennium. His\r\nexcellent report, “We the peoples: the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century”, is evidence\r\nof this.\r\nMali welcomes Tuvalu to the Assembly. Its\r\nadmission to membership further strengthens the\r\nuniversality of the Organization.\r\nMore than ever before, our world aspires to peace\r\nand security and sustainable human development. In\r\nthis respect, our fifty-fifth session is unprecedentedly\r\nimportant both historically and politically. The\r\nexceptional opportunity offered us in the Millennium\r\nSummit, which has renewed our hope in humankind,\r\nmust not be lost. The Millennium Declaration\r\ndemonstrates our maturity and our elevated sense of\r\nresponsibility for the future of humanity. Now we must\r\nbuild this better world to which we all aspire. The\r\npeoples of the United Nations look to us. They are\r\nimpatient. More than ever before they want to be actors\r\ndetermining their own future, particularly people who\r\ndo not have very much, our people. They want to be\r\nactors and to benefit from globalization.\r\nThat is how I see the historical and political\r\nmeaning of this session, which must give effect to the\r\ndynamic now under way. Here, all together, we\r\nreaffirm the place and the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\r\nin cooperation for development, which require that the\r\nUnited Nations become more legitimate by being more\r\ndemocratic and stronger. What I say will be set against\r\nthis backdrop.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity must remain our priority. The Organization is\r\nincreasingly faced with violent, deadly internal\r\nconflicts that have taken the lives of millions of\r\ncivilians. It is therefore crucial to improve the system\r\nof prevention and strengthen our institution’s capacity\r\nto organize and conduct operations effectively and\r\nsuccessfully. Here I pay tribute to the report of the\r\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations, led by\r\nLakhdar Brahimi. It is indeed a milestone in the\r\nprocess of trying to make the United Nations “truly\r\ncredible as a force for peace” (A/55/305), so we must\r\nquickly ensure that it has positive results. As the report\r\nrightly emphasizes, United Nations intervention must\r\nbe decided upon on the basis of uniform criteria,\r\nregardless of the region in which conflicts occur. The\r\nmultidisciplinary nature of new United Nations\r\npeacekeeping missions demands clear and precise\r\nmandates.\r\nMali welcomes efforts to strengthen cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations in regard to maintaining\r\npeace, while respecting the competence of the Security\r\nCouncil. Recent events in Sierra Leone remind us of\r\nthis and are a real challenge to us. Efforts by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and subregional\r\norganizations must be supported to establish regional\r\ncapacity. This also applies to the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS), which already has\r\na peacekeeping force and will soon have an early\r\nwarning system.\r\nPeacekeeping operations cannot be a permanent\r\nsolution to conflicts or an answer to the underlying\r\ncauses. The international community must move from a\r\nculture of reaction to a culture of prevention based on a\r\nmultidimensional approach, helping to save many\r\nhuman lives and making additional resources available\r\nfor development. We must also emphasize that the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in peacekeeping\r\ndepends largely on its capacity for prevention, crisis\r\nmanagement and peace-building. Here I appeal to the\r\ninternational community to provide a stable and\r\nhealthy financial base for the Organization’s\r\npeacekeeping activities.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nI pay tribute to the second Security Council\r\nsummit held on 7 September, which dealt with the need\r\nto give the Council an effective role in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, particularly in\r\nAfrica. The resolution that emerged from that summit\r\ndeserves the support of us all, for it will certainly\r\nstrengthen our capacity for prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement.\r\nWe must also continue work to free the world\r\nfrom the fear of weapons of mass destruction and face\r\nup to the threat of light weapons.\r\nWith regard to nuclear non-proliferation, the\r\nindefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty (NPT) regime, the entry into force of the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention, the signing and\r\nratification of many other treaties on important aspects\r\nof disarmament, and the creation of nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones, are all important contributions to\r\nconfidence-building and nuclear disarmament.\r\nMali is fully committed to work to halt the plague\r\nof the proliferation of light weapons. I appeal for\r\ngreater coordinated support for regional efforts,\r\nincluding support for moratoriums, respect for\r\nembargoes on arms deliveries and the strengthening of\r\ncontrols. The United Nations conference in 2001 on\r\nthis issue must give the international community an\r\nopportunity to take appropriate steps to end the\r\nexcessive destabilizing accumulation of such weapons.\r\nThe conference must look at all aspects and be fully\r\ntransparent.\r\nI must mention here the troubling issue of\r\nchildren affected by conflict, child soldiers, for the link\r\nbetween the proliferation of light weapons and the\r\nintolerable fate of these children is only too obvious.\r\nWe have a great responsibility for them, and we must\r\nput an end to the destruction of so many hopes. The\r\nInternational Conference on War-affected Children,\r\nheld in Winnipeg, which ended just a few days ago,\r\nwas an opportunity for us all to strengthen our\r\ncommitment to guarantee all children better health,\r\nschool for all, both boys and girls, free from war,\r\nviolence and famine.\r\nAt the beginning of the third millennium one of\r\nthe most urgent tasks facing humanity is to end the\r\ngrowing inequality between rich and poor countries.\r\nWe must tackle the underlying causes of conflict —\r\nprimarily their economic and social dimensions. In an\r\ninternational environment that is increasingly marked\r\nby globalization, continuing poverty is our most\r\ndifficult challenge. The problem of the debt of the\r\ndeveloping countries must remain our focus, because it\r\nis a major obstacle to their development. Complete\r\ncancellation of the debt is needed in the overall\r\nframework of finding a new development strategy.\r\nThis new development strategy involves direct\r\ninvestment, unhampered access to markets through\r\nspecial, differential treatment, fair prices for our goods,\r\nand transfers of new technology, all of which are major\r\nfactors in development. This means that financing\r\ndevelopment must remain on our agenda. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the convening in 2001 of a high-\r\nlevel conference to deal with this issue at the\r\nintergovernmental level. The challenges of\r\ndevelopment cannot be taken up unless there is a stable\r\ninternational financial system. My country advocates a\r\nreform of the international financial system that takes\r\naccount of the social dimension of development and\r\ndoes not jeopardize nations’ capacity to pursue their\r\nnational development objectives.\r\nAfrica has understood full well that its role and\r\nplace in the emerging world implies a renewed political\r\napproach of integration and unity of our continent.\r\nThat is the backdrop to the creation of the African\r\nUnion, which calls for a united Africa, strengthened by\r\nan integrated development of its full potential and a\r\nheightened awareness of its strategic advantages. Mali\r\nwas the first country to ratify the Constitutive Act of\r\nthe Union, which we are convinced is the springboard\r\nfor the development of the continent, and for a\r\nresponsible Africa, an Africa that counts.\r\nWe must work together to eradicate poverty. We\r\nhave a responsibility to guarantee all human beings a\r\nlife of decency and dignity, with equal opportunities\r\nfor all peoples. We can do this. It requires enhanced\r\ncooperation and international solidarity through a\r\nmultilateral approach guided by the United Nations.\r\nWe must promote global social development, for\r\nwe believe that excessive unshared wealth is a poor\r\nkind of wealth, a wealth with no social value and\r\ntherefore contrary to the essence of our life.\r\nThe values that give meaning to the wealth of the\r\nworld are those of democracy. Here I refer to the strong\r\nwords of President Konaré, who rightly told the\r\ncommunity of democracies conference, held in\r\nWarsaw, that the development of democracy is the\r\nbasis for a world of peace, solidarity and social justice,\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nand that only democracy can allow each of us to\r\nshoulder the burden, but also the honour, of being a\r\nhuman being and serving humankind. “What an honour\r\nit is to be a human being!” he said.\r\nThe Ministerial Conference on Security, Stability,\r\nDevelopment and Cooperation in Africa said rightly\r\nthat democracy, good governance, respect for human\r\nrights, the rights of peoples, and the rule of law, are\r\nprerequisites to achieving security, stability and\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Nothing must prevent open\r\ndiscussion of ideas and the promotion of political\r\npluralism. Despite inadequacies, difficulties and\r\nsometimes violent breakdowns, the democratic process\r\nis gaining ground in Africa. A democratic Africa is\r\nbecoming increasingly real, but it is still a fragile\r\nreality that must be supported and helped. Mali\r\nwelcomes the adoption last June by the [Community of\r\nDemocracies] of the Warsaw Declaration, advocating\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation among democratic\r\ncountries with a view to sharing the best practices,\r\nprotecting themselves against threats to democratic\r\nprocesses, and promoting the emergence of a\r\npartnership forum to help democracies in transition.\r\nWe must be strong against unconstitutional\r\nchange of political regimes so that we can strengthen\r\ndemocracy. We must condemn such changes as a matter\r\nof principle and there must be consequences. President\r\nKonaré said that pressure must be credible and can\r\nonly attain its goal if the international community\r\nadopts a firm consistent and constructive approach in\r\nthe event of any putsch or attempted coup d’état. It\r\nmust avoid encouraging those who are tempted to\r\nviolate republican and democratic rules by removing\r\nany ambiguity. In this respect, the international\r\ncommunity must be clearer and more rigorous in its\r\napproach and support the OAU which seeks to deter\r\nputsches by taking a clear position and by imposing\r\npolitical sanctions. Could this position not also be\r\ntaken up in the United Nations?\r\nAlong the same lines the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court with the Rome Statues\r\nwould be a permanent body to act against impunity. It\r\nwould allow us to try those responsible for the most\r\nhorrible crimes and it would also be a tool for\r\ndeterrence that could contribute to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Mali has already\r\nratified the Court’s Statute, thus showing that it\r\nsupports the struggle against the culture of impunity\r\nand to ensure respect for human dignity.\r\nIn view of the progress in achieving some\r\nsettlement in the Lockerbie matter, we would call for\r\nthe definitive and immediate lifting of sanctions that\r\nare unjustly inflicting suffering on the brother people\r\nof the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We must be careful\r\nabout sanctions because of the humanitarian cost\r\ninvolved. We must use more effective, targeted\r\nsanctions.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula we welcome the recent\r\ninter-Korean summit and the exchange visits by\r\npeoples of both countries. We welcome and support\r\nthese initiatives which begin a direct dialogue between\r\nthe parties involved and promote peace and stability in\r\nthe Korean peninsula.\r\nHIV/AIDS jeopardizes the future of millions of\r\nmen, women and children in Africa and it is also a\r\nthreat to international peace and security. A failure to\r\ndeal with this would be culpable and suicidal\r\nindifference. In this connection we fully support the\r\nproposal to convene a special session of the General\r\nAssembly on AIDS.\r\nAdapting the United Nations to the requirements\r\nof the age is absolutely essential. The challenges facing\r\nus in the political, economic and social areas force us\r\nto demonstrate creativity and realism so that we can\r\ncome up with innovative and constructive suggestions\r\nand translate them into action in the true interests of\r\nour peoples. My delegation believes in the need to\r\ndemocratize the United Nations further, to restructure\r\nall its principal organs. Reform of the Security Council\r\nwill give effect to our desire to modernize this\r\nimportant organ that the Charter makes primarily\r\nresponsible for threats to and breaches of international\r\npeace and security. A reformed Council must be more\r\ntransparent in its working methods, more democratic,\r\nmore representative, more legitimate in its\r\nmembership, and it must be more credible in the way it\r\nis perceived by other member States. Mali reaffirms\r\nAfrica’s demand for equitable distribution of seats in\r\nthe two categories, pursuant to the Harare Declaration\r\nadopted by the OAU Summit of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment.\r\nMore than ever before the human being must be\r\nthe very heart of the new millennium. The peoples\r\nexpect the United Nations to promote and ensure a\r\nworld of progress for all, a world of peace, a world of\r\nsharing. In this respect Mali sees the Millennium\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nDeclaration as the fabric we can use to build a better\r\nworld. Now is the time for action.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I now give the floor to the next speaker, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, Chairman\r\nof the delegation of Qatar.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I should like at the outset to extend my\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his election to\r\npreside over the work of this important fifty-fifth\r\nsession. It is indeed important because it is the first\r\nsession in the new millennium. We are confident that\r\nhis experience and diplomatic capability will be, God\r\nwilling, great assets in our effort to achieve the desired\r\nsuccess. I also extend my sincere thanks to the\r\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session, His Excellency Dr.\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, and to his friendly country,\r\nNamibia, noting that his outstanding efforts had a\r\ntremendous impact on solving numerous difficulties\r\nand achieving good results in many matters during the\r\npast session. I should further like to express my thanks\r\nand appreciation to His Excellency, Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, who tried his utmost and has not\r\ncompromised, in his effort to realize the goals aspired\r\nto by all peoples of the world. We also appreciate his\r\nendeavour in preparing the report before us.\r\nA few days ago the world witnessed a great event\r\nin time and place, hosted in this building. This very\r\nsame hall was crowded with a unique assemblage of\r\nworld leaders who came from every corner of the globe\r\nto attend the Millennium Summit. The attendance of so\r\nmany leaders and their desire to participate signifies\r\nmany things, most important of which is their firm\r\nrecognition of the role of the United Nations, which\r\nrepresents the hope of the peoples of the world for the\r\nachievement of a peaceful coexistence that guarantees\r\nsecurity, peace and well-being for all. The Summit\r\nDeclaration has deeply impressed us all. We trust that\r\nthe role of the United Nations will grow stronger when\r\nStates, particularly the great Powers, look beyond their\r\nnarrow, short-lived interests, work in the interests of\r\nthis Organization, and firmly abide by its Charter for\r\nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means and by\r\nresorting to the international judicial system. That\r\nwould be a civilized demonstration of the progress\r\nachieved by nations and an acknowledgement of the\r\nsignificance and fairness of the rule of law, which is an\r\ninstrument of security and peace, whose decisions\r\ndeserve respect and full obedience.\r\nWe, in the State of Qatar, under the leadership of\r\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the dearly\r\nbeloved Emir of the country, give the United Nations\r\nand all its international organizations their due\r\nappreciation and respect as part of the philosophy of\r\nour system, which is based on truth and justice, both\r\ninternally and externally. We consider democracy and\r\nhuman rights to be essential targets that we strive to\r\nattain according to our special cultural, religious and\r\nsocial characteristics. We thank God that we are aiming\r\nin the right direction.\r\nAs the Assembly is well aware, we live in a\r\nregion that has for two decades been plagued by\r\ndisasters and crises. No sooner does one problem calm\r\ndown than another erupts like an active volcano. But\r\nmany good people from the Arab Gulf, and honourable\r\npeople and lovers of peace from other parts of the\r\nworld, are trying their best to establish security in a\r\nregion of great importance to present civilization, as\r\nthe region has embedded in it a sizeable portion of the\r\nsources of energy needed by all. No sooner had the\r\nIraqi-Iranian war, which devastated the region and left\r\nit with bleeding wounds, come to an end and people\r\nhad hopes of a period of rest during which the wounds\r\ncould be healed, than another crisis occurred, greater in\r\ndimensions and more complex this time, namely, the\r\nsecond Gulf War, the invasion of Kuwait and its\r\nliberation and the economic boycott of Iraq, which has\r\ngone on for a decade so far, killing people, particularly\r\nchildren, the ill and the ageing. All of us now know\r\nthat the sanctions have failed to achieve the goal for\r\nwhich they were established. Their course has changed\r\nso much that they have become like a plague afflicting\r\npeople. Not only do we call for the lifting of sanctions\r\nimposed on Iraq and putting an end to the suffering of\r\nits people, but also for a reconsideration of the issue of\r\nimposing sanctions, whether by individual States or\r\nthrough the United Nations, for recourse to sanctions\r\nhas completely failed, leaving behind merely rancour\r\nand hatred.\r\nIn referring to the humanitarian situation in Iraq\r\nand realizing that humanitarian matters are indivisible,\r\nwe welcome the Secretary-General’s appointment of\r\nYuli Vorontsov to be his representative regarding the\r\nfate of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons, so as to\r\nbring this phase of human suffering to an end. The\r\nState of Qatar sincerely hopes that through concerted\r\nbilateral and regional efforts a solution will be found to\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nthe problem of prisoners and missing persons, whether\r\nthey be our Kuwaiti or Iraqi brothers.\r\nIn this context I should like to note that last year\r\nmy Government welcomed the positive development\r\nand the progress that had been made for the settlement\r\nof the “Lockerbie” question. We commend the\r\ncooperation and positive response by the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya and its fulfilment of its obligations. On the\r\nother hand, we emphasize the necessity and\r\ninevitability of lifting the sanctions imposed on Libya,\r\nwhich had been temporarily suspended, because the\r\nwhole issue had been referred to a court following the\r\nextradition of the two Libyan suspects. Consequently,\r\nthere is no longer legal justification for the\r\ncontinuation of such sanctions.\r\nThe principle of dialogue or recourse to the\r\ninternational judicial system referred to at the\r\nbeginning of my address, fully applies to the dispute\r\nbetween the Emirates and Iran over the occupied\r\nislands. The State of Qatar strives, within the tripartite\r\ncommittee established by the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil, which includes our sister States the Kingdom\r\nof Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman, to reach a\r\nsolution acceptable to both parties through bilateral\r\ndialogue or recourse to international arbitration.\r\nSimilarly the Middle East question is foremost in\r\nour priority concerns. An endeavour to solve this\r\nquestion was launched but it faced obstacles and\r\nimpediments that prevented the attainment of the\r\nmuch-sought-after peace based on legitimate\r\ninternational resolutions, particularly Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which were the\r\nfoundations of the peace process. The Arabs consider\r\npeace their strategic option, yet a comprehensive peace\r\nis still beyond reach, owing to Israeli intransigence,\r\ninflexibility and disregard of the basic rights of the\r\nArab nation. This intransigence was an impediment to\r\npeace on the Syrian-Lebanese track. Israel’s refusal to\r\nwithdraw to the 4 June 1967 borders did not meet the\r\nminimum conditions placed by the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic, consistent with United Nations resolutions.\r\nSimply because of a few metres Israel wasted a rare\r\nchance for peace.\r\nThe situation on the Palestinian track, which is\r\nthe core and crux of the dispute in the region, is no\r\nbetter. At the Camp David summit the Government of\r\nIsrael proved that it was captive to the extremist wing\r\nof its people and that it was not mature enough to take\r\nthe brave decision of bringing to an end a conflict that\r\nhas lasted for half a century. Moreover, Israel’s\r\ninsistence on the occupation of East Jerusalem is\r\nprovocative to the feelings of millions of Muslims and\r\nChristians throughout the world. Israel must abide by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967), on the basis of\r\nwhich the peace process was launched and which calls\r\nfor its withdrawal from all Arab lands to the borders of\r\n4 June 1967. Furthermore, the conflict will not come to\r\nan end without solving the question of Palestinian\r\nrefugees, in accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 194 (III).\r\nThis leads to the question of Israeli settlements in\r\noccupied Arab territories. These settlements are time\r\nbombs standing in the way of any resolution to the\r\nconflict. Extremist Zionists planted these settlements to\r\nblock any peaceful solution, in contradiction of\r\nnumerous General Assembly and Security Council\r\nresolutions that explicitly declare them illegitimate.\r\nThe State of Qatar, declaring its full support of the\r\nlegitimate Arab demands on the Syrian, Lebanese and\r\nPalestinian tracks, hopes that the voice of reason, love\r\nand peace will eventually prevail, that a just and lasting\r\npeace in the Middle East will be achieved, and that an\r\nindependent Palestinian state, ruling over all\r\nPalestinian national territory with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as\r\nits capital, will be established. The United States of\r\nAmerica, whose efforts in the peace process are\r\nappreciated, is called upon more than at any time in the\r\npast, to exert pressure on Israel to respond to the\r\nchallenges of peace and not miss this historic\r\nopportunity as a result of narrow, short-lived\r\nambitions; the alternative to the peace process is too\r\ndangerous for international peace and security, and\r\ncould lead us all into a maze whose outcome would be\r\nknown only to God.\r\nThe State of Qatar supports attempts made at\r\nnational reconciliation in our sisterly State, the Sudan,\r\nand endorses the efforts of the Sudanese Government\r\nin this respect, and hopes that goodwill and sincerity\r\nwill lead to consensus so that people’s efforts will be\r\ndirected towards development and reconstruction. At\r\nthe same time it requests that foreign parties refrain\r\nfrom prolonging the crisis at the expense of the\r\nbrotherly people of the Sudan, who pay the price with\r\nillness, hunger and blood.\r\nWe also support the tireless efforts of the\r\nPresident and the Government of Djibouti to solve the\r\nelusive and chronic Somali problem, and thank God\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nthat those efforts have been fruitful. Here we extend\r\nour congratulations to His Excellency, President\r\nAbdikassim Salad Hassan, the elected Somali\r\nPresident. We wish him and his Government every\r\nsuccess. We assure him that he will find in the State of\r\nQatar the necessary help and support in order to sail the\r\nboat of national reconciliation safely to land. We also\r\nhope that our Somali brothers will help treat each\r\nother’s wounds, put an end to the chaos and destruction\r\nthat has befallen their country for a decade, and\r\nrespond to the hopes and aspirations of their people,\r\nwho dream of security, peace and a life of honour and\r\nfreedom, like all peoples of the world.\r\nThis leads us to the entire region of the Horn of\r\nAfrica, where war, drought and famine have inflicted\r\nuntold suffering on its people, with whom we have\r\nrelations of kinship and neighbourhood. We wish them\r\nstability and every good, and we hope that their efforts\r\nwill be directed towards action and construction.\r\nThe State of Qatar looks closely and with concern\r\nat what is plotted against our sisterly State, Indonesia,\r\nthe most populous Muslim State and one that has a\r\nprominent place in the minds of all Muslims. Intrigues\r\nare being secretly contrived to dissect this peaceful\r\nMuslim State under the pretext of human rights and\r\nother means of deception that fool nobody. We\r\nemphasize our strong and unreserved support for the\r\nsovereignty of Indonesia over all its territories, and for\r\nits territorial integrity and national unity. Events in\r\nIndonesia constitute a domestic affair, the like of which\r\noccurs in many States in the world. The Indonesian\r\nGovernment, God willing, is capable of putting an end\r\nto such problems among its citizens, regardless of their\r\nrace, religion or orientation. We realize too that\r\nfinancial difficulties and poverty are among the main\r\nfactors of these internal problems.\r\nIt is hoped that this session, the first in the new\r\nmillennium, will give us a strong impetus to reflect on\r\nour world today with all its disparities embodied in the\r\ndaily life of hundreds of millions of people. A close\r\nscrutiny of the world will reveal a rich, developed\r\nNorth enjoying prosperity, democracy, economic\r\nstability and ample opportunities for creativity and\r\ninnovation, and a poor South, many of whose States try\r\nhard to catch up with the march of civilization and\r\nprogress and utilize all their capabilities for the\r\ndevelopment of their infrastructures and the\r\nadvancement of their people. However, other States of\r\nthe South continue to suffer from war and conflict both\r\nbetween States and among citizens of the same country,\r\nthus causing their suffering to increase and their\r\nresources to be wasted on acquiring weapons instead of\r\nbeing used for education, health and the building of\r\ninfrastructures.\r\nSince economic factors contribute enormously to\r\nthe continuation of wars and disputes, it is incumbent\r\nupon us to solve the causes of these crises. That can\r\nonly be achieved with the cooperation of all,\r\nparticularly the rich States of the North. Foremost\r\namong those crises are indebtedness and the\r\naccumulation of interest that exhaust the income of\r\nmany States of the South. We hope that the States of\r\nthe North and their creditor institutions will respond to\r\nthe numerous appeals to write off, either wholly or\r\npartially, the debts or interest of the poorest countries\r\nwhich strive to upgrade their fragile economies. We\r\nmust also conduct a comprehensive review of the\r\ninternational banking system by holding an\r\ninternational conference in which all countries of the\r\nworld participate, with the aim of establishing a wise,\r\nfair and just pilot policy for the world economy in the\r\nnew millennium, taking into consideration the issue of\r\ndevelopment in third world countries and directing\r\ninvestment and capital towards the establishment of a\r\ngenuine partnership that promotes such development.\r\nGlobalization has impacted every region and\r\ntransformed the world into a small village, no part of\r\nwhich can be separated from the other parts. Therefore,\r\nthe transfer of technology, especially information and\r\ncommunications technology, must be accompanied by\r\ntransparent globalization, rather than selective\r\nglobalization wherein third world countries are no\r\nmore than markets for the products of developed\r\ncountries and large corporations.\r\nThe process of reforming the United Nations\r\nattracts the attention of all States, and I have referred to\r\nit on other occasions at past sessions. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts are outstanding in this respect. For the\r\nrealization of an active Organization responding\r\nharmoniously to contemporary requirements, its work\r\nhas to be activated, the number of its employees who\r\ndrain its resources has to be cut back, and the dynamics\r\nof its work, both at Headquarters and in its bodies,\r\norgans and offices elsewhere, have to be changed.\r\nMoreover, the process of reforming the Security\r\nCouncil requires the Working Group to proceed until it\r\nachieves the goal for which it was established. The\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nWorking Group has indeed gone a long way in that\r\nrespect, particularly with regard to the second cluster\r\nrelating to procedural matters in the work of the\r\nCouncil. As for expanding the Council and increasing\r\nits membership, the State of Qatar is committed to the\r\nposition of the Arab Group and the countries of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement that calls for a minimum\r\nincrease of up to 26 members, taking into consideration\r\nequitable geographical distribution and the fact that the\r\nlast increase in its membership took place in 1963. We\r\nalso endorse the continuation of the Working Group,\r\nwhich, God willing, will reach a consensual solution.\r\nAt the same time we emphasize the right of the Arab\r\nworld to a permanent seat in any impending increase.\r\nA few terms and ideas have recently gained\r\ncurrency, and though they sound good they imply a\r\ngreat threat to States and nations. Danger is not\r\ninherent in these terms but is rather a consequence of\r\ntheir interpretation or application. Intervention in\r\nhumanitarian cases is one of these ideas that can be\r\nexploited by the great Powers to justify interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of States and the violation of their\r\nnational sovereignty. Promotion of democracies in the\r\nworld, the code of conduct and good governance are all\r\nrelative, and if they were to be used according to their\r\npresent interpretation, the world would run according\r\nto a single style of democracy and one culture would\r\nprevail. This is so serious that it would eliminate\r\npluralism, which is an enriching factor in the work of\r\nthe United Nations, since it indicates diversity and\r\ndifference among peoples and nations. This very same\r\ndiversity contributes positively to world interests,\r\npromotes humanitarian and cultural exchanges and\r\nenables each of us to accept other cultures and coexist\r\nwith them. True democracy is one that is freely chosen\r\nby any people for its mode of governance without\r\noutside intervention.\r\nThe year 2001, the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, may offer us a good\r\nopportunity to demonstrate more tolerance and\r\ncommunication among nations for the benefit of\r\nhumanity. I should like here to refer to the address by\r\nHis Highness, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the\r\nbeloved Emir of Qatar, on 5 September 2000 when the\r\ndialogue among civilizations initiative was launched,\r\nand to His Highness’s emphasis on the significance of\r\ndialogue and communication as an alternative to\r\ndispute and conflict.\r\nPeacekeeping forces play a very important role,\r\nestablishing security and stability in many different\r\nregions suffering from conflict and war, and as time\r\npasses, the cost of operating these forces rise. At this\r\nsession the Fifth Committee will discuss the issue of\r\ncontributions to these forces. We maintain that the\r\nFifth Committee is the best forum for this, but since\r\nthis process is linked to Members’ assessed\r\ncontributions to the regular budget, we believe that\r\nfinalizing the scale of assessments first is a reasonable\r\npriority. Our delegation will actively take part in the\r\nwork of that Committee with the aim of reaching a\r\nconsensus, without which we cannot find a solution to\r\nthe problem of committing any State to something it\r\ncannot meet in the future. We stress that all aspects of\r\nthe economic situation of each State should be\r\nconsidered, particularly the emerging economies that\r\nrely on one source of income and that are subject to\r\nmarket volatility. My country is one of those States.\r\nFinally, the State of Qatar firmly believes in the\r\nimportance of the role of the United Nations in\r\nestablishing security, stability and peace throughout the\r\nworld, and it also believes in the importance of\r\nrespecting the United Nations Charter and its lofty\r\ngoals, and the need to adhere to the Charter in\r\ninternational relations. We trust and hope that the\r\nfuture will be bright, when all peoples of the globe will\r\nrealize their goals and aspirations and will positively\r\ncontribute to the process of building, development and\r\ninnovation.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr.\r\nAlhaji Sule Lamido, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNigeria.\r\nMr. Lamido (Nigeria): Please allow me to share\r\nwith Mr. Holkeri the joy of his election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly. He can rest assured of Nigeria’s support and\r\ncooperation. May I also express the same sentiment on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77. To his predecessor and my\r\ncolleague, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of\r\nNamibia, Nigeria and the Group of 77 wish to express\r\nour pride in and appreciation of the most distinguished\r\nmanner in which he discharged his duties as the\r\nPresident of the fifty-fourth session. We are indeed\r\nvery proud of him.\r\nMay I also commend the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, for the manner in which he has piloted\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nand continues to manage the affairs of the United\r\nNations. I would also like to thank him for his\r\nmillennium report, which has identified some of the\r\npressing problems and challenges facing mankind.\r\nIn the past few weeks here at the United Nations\r\na lot of reflection and deep thinking have taken place\r\namong world leaders, all in an attempt to more\r\ncoherently define the future. The end of one\r\nmillennium and the beginning of another warrant all\r\nthese efforts to find such a purposeful definition. Fifty-\r\nfive years ago the United Nations was formed as a\r\nglobal bulwark against armed conflict on a world scale,\r\nsuch as the Second World War. Over the years its\r\nmandate of preserving international security has\r\nbroadened from strictly preventing such armed conflict\r\nto cover also fundamental issues of socio-economic\r\nsecurity for humanity. For example, in many of the\r\ndeveloping countries the United Nations manifests its\r\npotential more through the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund, the World Health Organization, the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization and other agencies than in Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, comparatively speaking. It is also\r\nfrom the activities of these United Nations agencies\r\nthat the underprivileged sectors of poor countries\r\nbenefit directly, activities from which these same\r\ncountries, including those in Africa, have come to\r\nimbibe the idealism regarding the United Nations\r\nability to harmonize the totality of progress to the\r\nbenefit of all human stakeholders.\r\nTo a great extent this idealism has not been\r\nmisplaced. In fact, at no other time has the possibility\r\nof a global family been more real than now. This\r\nprospect must, I am sure, have been very exciting to so\r\nmany of us and must have been the basis for hailing the\r\nUnited Nations system for its own role in and\r\ncontribution to these achievements. But as my\r\nPresident, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, aptly observed\r\nhere less than two weeks ago,\r\n“Although the world has generally become a\r\nsafer place to live in, thanks to the contributions\r\nof the United Nations, we must all feel deeply\r\nworried that the message of hope which the\r\nOrganization has been spreading is yet to reach\r\nthe millions of humankind for whom it is\r\nintended. For the vast majority of our peoples,\r\ngrinding poverty has remained a fact of their\r\neveryday existence.” (A/55/PV.7)\r\nThis reality of grinding poverty has raised\r\nconsiderable apprehension in some United Nations\r\nMember States about their fate in the new millennium.\r\nThere is a clear basis for this apprehension, given that\r\nthe past millennium was, for most of these countries,\r\ncharacterized by extreme poverty, heavy indebtedness,\r\nwars of attrition and the resultant mass ordeal and\r\nanguish for both their immediate and distant victims,\r\nabsolute vulnerability to epidemics such as cholera,\r\nmalaria and typhoid, the rage of the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, the scourge of natural disasters, serious\r\ntechnological backwardness and a digital divide\r\nbetween them and the others, and by profound\r\neconomic decline and infrastructural decay. In the last\r\ndecade in particular, whatever hopes were raised by\r\nsome initiatives aimed at mitigating African and third\r\nworld underdevelopment have dwindled to nothing as\r\nthe world emerged from the cold war into a more\r\nproblematic concept called globalization.\r\nThe globe, which is the symbol or logo of the\r\nUnited Nations, depicts humanity. From the word\r\n“globe” has been derived a phenomenon called\r\nglobalization, which explicitly connotes a world\r\nwithout national borders, with particular reference to\r\ncommerce, in which humanity is one huge market.\r\nApart from thus unfortunately associating the noble\r\nand emotive word “humanity” with the materialism of\r\ncommerce and the market, globalization automatically\r\nraises other questions for three quarters of humanity\r\noutside the orbit of industrial competence.\r\nIn a global economy all the actors in that\r\neconomy should also be stakeholders. But what stake\r\ndoes Africa have in a global economy? Economically,\r\nit is heavily indebted, some of its countries committing\r\nup to 55 per cent of gross earnings to debt servicing\r\nand payment. What can the little that is left do for the\r\ndomestic economy? What does an economy that\r\nproduces virtually nothing in industrial terms have to\r\noffer, and, moreover, how can it compete in a global\r\neconomy? What is the income level of the average\r\nAfrican, relative to that of his or her counterparts in\r\nmany countries of the West, vis-à-vis the capacity to\r\npatronize the goods and services which globalization\r\noffers? How does globalization facilitate democratic\r\nconsolidation? How can the core values of liberal\r\ndemocracy, such as the rule of law, the preservation of\r\nhuman rights and good governance, be sustained by a\r\nGovernment that lacks the resources to competently\r\nprovide a minimum of social service delivery and thus\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nsustain legitimacy and regime credibility? In what\r\nways would a typical regime in Africa be able to\r\ncontribute its quota to democratic consolidation with\r\nthe debt overhang, the exchange and interest rate\r\npractices in the international financial architecture, the\r\nprices offered for raw materials relative to the prices of\r\nindustrial goods and services, the limited trade access\r\nand the conditionalities tied to loans and aid?\r\nAs a responsible member of the international\r\ncommunity and as the chair of the G-77, Nigeria is\r\nobliged to draw attention to the context of our present\r\nsituation. What is clear to me now is that the dream of\r\na global family cannot be attained if the present world\r\narchitecture of power and the reward system continues.\r\nThe dialogue of the Organization of African Unity, the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the G-77 with the G-8\r\ncountries has so far shown that a great deal can be\r\nachieved from that approach to the issues in question.\r\nAs President Obasanjo again said in a separate speech,\r\nit is imperative for the world to seize this moment to\r\nbegin to get the future right, since such a solemn\r\nmoment in the history of mankind as the recent\r\nMillennium Summit, may not always present itself. We\r\nare talking of dialogue that takes the issues on board in\r\na holistic manner, as opposed to the current practice of\r\nabstracting merely one or other manifestation of the\r\nsystem — for example, in the case of wars of attrition\r\nand the idea of international humanitarian intervention.\r\nThe debate so far has brought to the fore the\r\nproblem of the contradiction between sovereignty and\r\nintervention. Of course, nation States, even those on\r\nthe verge of evaporation, would be sensitive to the\r\nword “intervention”. But, more than that, discussion of\r\nthe issue has brought out the one-dimensional nature of\r\nthe treatment of some issues or problems in terms of\r\nwhat we include in or exclude from the definition. In\r\nthis particular case, the debate so far has concentrated\r\non war situations or armed conflicts featuring massive\r\nloss of life.\r\nWhat of other situations where loss of life is also\r\nof a serious magnitude but not as a result of war or\r\narmed conflict? What of the silent genocide occasioned\r\nby the HIV/AIDS pandemic, epidemics and natural\r\ndisasters such as famine, drought, flood, etc.? What\r\nabout the situation that arises when sanctions lead to\r\ndeaths on a serious scale? All these should find a place\r\nin a proper and systematic discussion of humanitarian\r\nintervention aimed at giving succour to those who may\r\nbe trapped in tragedies other than wars.\r\nSimilarly, is there no other way by which the\r\nworld can arrest the proliferation of small arms and\r\nlight weapons in Africa and other parts of the South?\r\nCertainly the world knows about the nature and types\r\nof weapons used in the prosecution of these wars,\r\nwhere they are manufactured and by whom, the\r\nprocesses by which they are traded and acquired and\r\nthe key facilitators of these processes, including\r\nnational governments and arms merchants. What if the\r\nsearch for solutions focused on these areas?\r\nThese and many other weighty global issues were\r\ndiscussed at the first ever South Summit held in\r\nHavana last April. That Summit was a defining\r\nmoment for the Group of 77 countries which pondered\r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. In Havana\r\nthe South resolved to forge a new and meaningful\r\npartnership with the industrialized nations. We\r\ndemanded equal partnership in decision-making that\r\naffects the whole of humanity. That was the message\r\nthe leaders of the South took to the G8 Summit in\r\nOkinawa. The outcome of that consultation vividly\r\ndemonstrates that meaningful partnership is a must for\r\nthe new century. Certainly the interests of mankind\r\ncompel a more inclusive participation of all segments\r\nof our global community.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I now give the floor to Mr. Nasser Al-Kidwa,\r\nChairman of the Observer delegation of Palestine.\r\nMr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): At the outset allow me to convey to\r\nMr. Holkeri our congratulations on his election as\r\nPresident of this session of the General Assembly,\r\nexpressing our full confidence in him and wishing him\r\nevery possible success. This session has special\r\nimportance for Palestine and we hope that during its\r\nproceedings and under his leadership historic steps will\r\nbe taken in our favour. I should also like to thank His\r\nExcellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, President of the\r\nfifty-fourth session, a fighter for freedom and a fighter\r\nfor peace, for his excellent leadership during the course\r\nof the past year. I would be remiss if I failed to seize\r\nthe opportunity to express our special thanks to\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, for his effective leadership and for his special\r\ninterest in the situation in the Middle East and the\r\npeace process there.\r\nAs we meet in the wake of the Millennium\r\nSummit, it is incumbent upon us to seek to build upon\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nits outcome beginning with implementing the\r\nMillennium Declaration and adopting it as a guide for\r\nour work in the next era. This should be the case not\r\nonly with regard to globalization and future social and\r\neconomic issues, but also with regard to one of the\r\nmain tasks not fully achieved during the past era \u001f\r\nnamely, the achievement of self-determination by\r\npeoples under colonial domination and foreign\r\noccupation. That task will not be fully achieved until\r\nIsraeli occupation comes to an end and the Palestinian\r\nState has been established in accordance with\r\ninternational legitimacy. For us this is the step\r\nnecessary to place ourselves side by side with other\r\nmember States on the road to development, democracy\r\nand prosperity and so that we may be allowed to carry\r\nour small share of responsibility towards the\r\ninternational community and its future tasks.\r\nAs President Yasser Arafat mentioned in his\r\naddress to the Millennium Summit, the Palestine\r\nCentral Council met to consider the situation as the\r\nagreed date between the Palestinian and Israeli sides\r\nfor reaching a final status agreement, 13 September\r\n2000, approached; that date was also the deadline of\r\nthe agreed-upon extension of the five-year interim\r\nperiod that originally ended on 4 May 1999. The\r\nPalestine Central Council addressed this situation with\r\na high level of responsibility towards our people and\r\ntowards the peace process and took a difficult decision\r\nseeking a balance between the natural and historic\r\nrights of the Palestinian people to their State, based on\r\nthe partition resolution 181 (II) and in accordance with\r\nthe Declaration of Independence of 1988 and our right\r\nto establish this State at the end of the interim period,\r\non the one hand, and preserving what some have called\r\nthe last chance for the peace process and for reaching\r\nan agreement between the two sides through an\r\nadditional extension and the decision to continue the\r\nnegotiations for the next five or six weeks on the other.\r\nThe Council thus decided to delay the establishment of\r\nthe State and at the same time mandated the Executive\r\nCommittee and the presidency of the Palestine National\r\nCouncil and the Legislative Council to take the\r\nnecessary steps in this regard, including completion of\r\nthe constitutional declaration and laws for presidential\r\nand parliamentary elections, as well as the submission\r\nof an application for membership for the State of\r\nPalestine in the United Nations, followed by a report\r\non these steps to the Central Council no later than 15\r\nNovember 2000, the anniversary of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence.\r\nThat decision means first and foremost our desire\r\nand commitment to reach an agreement with the Israeli\r\nside if that side is truly ready for that. Secondly, it also\r\nmeans the agreement by the Palestinian side to\r\npostpone the establishment of the State, not only until\r\nthe end of the transitional period and its extension, but\r\nuntil the end of the realistic opportunity for achieving a\r\npossible final agreement at the present time. We\r\nbelieve that no one can expect us to go beyond that and\r\naccept the continuation of the present transitional\r\nsituation that is impossible to endure. We further\r\nbelieve that all States, including those that have\r\nadvised us to postpone, will understand this and will\r\nthus be ready to provide the necessary support for our\r\nsteps, including support for the application of Palestine\r\nfor membership in the United Nations.\r\nThe assumption of power by the current Israeli\r\nGovernment was coupled with a chorus of positive\r\nvoices that led to increased hope for rapid and honest\r\nimplementation of the agreements signed by the two\r\nsides aimed at achieving a final agreement in the\r\nagreed time. We honestly wanted to believe this and\r\ndealt with that Government positively and with full\r\ncommitment to the agreements. But the stubborn\r\nrealities began to impose themselves on the ground,\r\nregardless of the wishes and the artificial positive\r\nvoices. The current Government did not implement any\r\nof the provisions of these agreements except those\r\nprovisions that the former Government had explicitly\r\ncommitted itself to in implementation of the Wye River\r\nMemorandum of October 1998. This Government has\r\nnot carried out one centimetre of redeployment more\r\nthan Mr. Netanyahu had committed himself to, and it\r\nhas also failed to carry out the third redeployment.\r\nIllegal settlements, which are destructive to the peace\r\nprocess, have continued, even in Jabal Abu Ghneim,\r\nwhich was the reason the General Assembly convened\r\nits tenth emergency special session. A number of other\r\nillegal measures and practices have also continued,\r\ncreating a negative and tense climate. Amidst all of\r\nthat, final status negotiations started and we witnessed\r\nIsraeli foot-dragging and procrastination that we could\r\nnot understand and that has led to more doubts and\r\ntension.\r\nThen came the Camp David Summit, for which\r\nthorough preparation was needed before being\r\nconvened, something that was not accepted by the\r\nIsraeli side. Despite everything, the Summit\r\nrepresented a very important opportunity to move into\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\na new, serious phase of negotiations through the\r\npersonal involvement of President Bill Clinton and his\r\nSecretary of State and the rest of his team. We highly\r\nappreciate all the efforts made for the success of the\r\nSummit. For our part, we spared no effort in the same\r\ndirection. However, we believe that Israel’s lack of\r\nreadiness to comply with the terms of reference of the\r\npeace process prevented the success of such efforts.\r\nIn the wake of the Summit a campaign was\r\nlaunched by some parties and some biased media\r\norganizations to absolve the Israeli side of its\r\nresponsibility and to place undue pressure on the\r\nPalestinian side. For example, some say that the Israeli\r\nside progressed from its original positions during the\r\nnegotiations more than the Palestinian side. That is\r\nfactually incorrect, in addition to being the wrong\r\nyardstick to apply. It is incorrect because the\r\nPalestinian side has progressed from its original\r\nposition more than the Israeli side, but that happened\r\nwith the start of the peace process and the acceptance\r\nof the bases of such a process. The Palestinian side has\r\naccepted, despite the historic injustice, establishing its\r\nState in accordance with the partition plan, which gave\r\nus less than half of mandated Palestine, and has\r\naccepted as the basis for settlement Security Council\r\nresolution 242 (1967), which gives us less than a\r\nquarter of mandated Palestine. Is there a more\r\nmomentous concession than this? Is it possible to\r\nforget that and only look at positions taken during the\r\nCamp David negotiations, regardless of the past?\r\nIt is also the wrong yardstick to apply because the\r\nappropriate yardstick should be the closeness of the\r\nsides to the agreed basis of the peace process and their\r\ncommitment to Security Council resolution 242 (1967),\r\nthe implementation of which is the goal of the peace\r\nprocess, and not the extent of their movement from\r\noriginal positions, especially if such positions were\r\nillegal and irrational. Needless to say, the Palestinian\r\nside has fully adhered to this resolution and has never\r\nattempted to circumvent it, whereas the Israeli side has\r\nnever stopped pursuing positions violating that\r\nresolution and aiming to usurp more and more\r\nPalestinian land and rights.\r\nLet us have another look at the positions of the\r\nparties on some specific issues, so that all may be\r\naware of the details of the situation. With regard to\r\nJerusalem, the first kiblah and the third of the holy\r\nsanctuaries and the cradle of Jesus Christ, the other\r\nside claims that it made substantial concessions while\r\nthe Palestinians did not. It also claims that we have not\r\nshown enough sensitivity towards the holy sites\r\npertaining to Judaism. All of this is incorrect. The\r\nsigned agreements state that Jerusalem will be an issue\r\nfor negotiation, which means the whole of\r\nJerusalem — occupied East Jerusalem and West\r\nJerusalem, which is under de facto Israeli control. For\r\nour part, we have accepted that West Jerusalem shall be\r\nunder Israeli sovereignty and become the capital of\r\nIsrael. We have demanded the end of the occupation of\r\nEast Jerusalem so that it may come under Palestinian\r\nsovereignty and be the capital of Palestine. We have\r\naccepted that the city shall be open, and have accepted\r\nall kinds of guarantees for freedom of conscience,\r\nworship and access to all holy places under Palestinian\r\nsovereignty. In return for such flexibility, Israel is not\r\nsatisfied with recognized sovereignty over West\r\nJerusalem, but seeks also to usurp parts of occupied\r\nEast Jerusalem.\r\nWith regard to the Jewish holy places, we fully\r\nrespect their sacredness, and Islam recognizes the three\r\nmonotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity and\r\nIslam — and all their prophets. Thus, we have shown\r\nevery possible flexibility, even with regard to those\r\nplaces on lands in occupied East Jerusalem, to which\r\nresolution 242 (1967) is applicable. We have accepted\r\nthat the Western Wall of Al-Haram Al-Sharif, which is\r\nknown to the Arabs and Muslims as Al-Buraq Wall and\r\nto the Israelis and Jews as the Wailing Wall, shall be\r\nplaced under Israeli control, bearing in mind its\r\nsacredness to Judaism and consistent with the situation\r\nsince the British mandate on Palestine. In return for our\r\nflexibility Israel not only seeks sovereignty over the\r\nWestern Wall, but further challenges our sovereignty\r\nover Al-Haram Al-Sharif and seeks to maintain some\r\nform of sovereignty over it, something that will not be\r\naccepted by any Palestinian, Arab or Muslim leader,\r\nnot now and not in the future.\r\nWe have recently taken a major additional step in\r\nthis regard by indicating our readiness to accept a\r\ncertain mechanism for ensuring that no excavations are\r\nconducted under Al-Haram Al-Sharif, or even our\r\nreadiness to accept Muslim sovereignty over Al-Haram\r\nAl-Sharif through the Al-Quds Committee of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). This\r\nrepresents the utmost that can be done in terms of\r\ndealing with an Arab and Muslim trust over Palestinian\r\nland.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nWith regard to another important issue, namely,\r\nPalestinian refugees and their rights, the Palestinian\r\nside has upheld their rights in accordance with\r\ninternational law, like any other refugees in the world,\r\nand in accordance with relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions, in particular resolution 194 (III), including\r\ntheir right to return and to compensation. At the same\r\ntime, we have shown our readiness to accept specific\r\nimplementation mechanisms to be agreed upon. In\r\nreturn for our flexibility, Israel refuses to recognize its\r\nresponsibility for this human tragedy and refuses to\r\nrecognize the rights of the refugees, including their\r\nright to return, and wants only to compensate them, and\r\neven that at the expense of others and not in its\r\ncapacity as the party that seized their lands and\r\nproperties. Yesterday the Assembly heard Israel’s\r\nspokesman repeat what has been said, attempting not\r\nonly to deny Israel’s responsibility but also denying the\r\nindividual property of the refugees, more than 5.5\r\nmillion dunams of land, legal and full property of\r\nindividuals. The Acting Foreign Minister attempted to\r\nput an end to that in an address to the Assembly.\r\nThe third important issue is that of settlements\r\nand borders. We have affirmed that settlements are\r\nillegal and must not be built on Palestinian lands.\r\nFurthermore, Israel must withdraw to the armistice\r\nlines of 1949, which are commonly known as the lines\r\nof 4 June 1967. At the same time, and in order to\r\nresolve some of the demographic problems illegally\r\ncreated by Israel, we have shown our readiness to\r\naccept changes in the border lines on the basis of full\r\nreciprocity. In return for such flexibility, Israel still\r\nattempts to appropriate more land and to annex other\r\nparts of occupied Palestinian territory. However, we\r\ngenerally feel, or at least hope, that the differences on\r\nthis and the remaining issues are less sharp than the\r\ndifferences I indicated regarding the two previous ones,\r\nand it is hoped this might signify a real change in the\r\nIsraeli position regarding all issues.\r\nWe have not lost hope yet. We are still committed\r\nto the peace process and to serious and continuous\r\nnegotiations in the coming weeks. Yet this morning we\r\nwere surprised to hear the spokesman of the Israeli\r\nGovernment announce that the negotiations are\r\nsuspended. We hope that the Israeli positions are\r\ntactical and that the Israeli side will in the final\r\nanalysis respect its commitment to the bases of the\r\npeace process. We want an agreement, an agreement\r\nthat will remove us from the cycle of confrontation and\r\nthat will carry forward both sides, and the entire region\r\nand its future generations, to a new era. Such an\r\nagreement must be balanced, reasonable and based on\r\ninternational law, the basis of the peace process. This\r\nrequires a continuation of the necessary efforts and\r\nunbiased support of the two cosponsors of the peace\r\nprocess, particularly the United States of America,\r\nother concerned parties in the region, the European\r\nUnion and interested parties throughout the world. We\r\nare ready and look forward to such a historic agreement\r\nbetween the two States, Palestine and Israel.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit much was said\r\nabout the United Nations and its past and future role.\r\nWe wish to add that the United Nations is\r\nindispensable when it comes to the question of\r\nPalestine and the situation in the Middle East. We have\r\nalways emphasized the permanent responsibility of the\r\nUnited Nations for the question of Palestine until it is\r\neffectively resolved in all its aspects, and while we\r\nalways called for more United Nations involvement in\r\nthe Middle East peace process, others have attempted\r\nto exclude and neutralize it. We are convinced that in\r\nthe coming decisive period the role of the United\r\nNations will become more important, no matter what\r\nthe circumstances. If we were, God forbid, to arrive at\r\na dead end despite all our strenuous efforts for the\r\nsuccess of the peace process, then we would come to\r\nthe United Nations and expect to receive its protection\r\nand support. We will work to obtain membership and to\r\ncontribute to the resolutions of the United Nations, the\r\nestablished committees and the relevant programmes so\r\nthat all might provide an additional boost for the\r\nachievement of our people’s legitimate rights,\r\nincluding their right to the establishment of their\r\nindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital, after\r\nsuch a long period of trial and tribulation.\r\nIf our hope is fulfilled and we are successful in\r\nreaching a final agreement with our neighbours, then\r\nwe expect that the need for the United Nations and its\r\norgans will be greater. The United Nations\r\nresponsibility in all its forms will continue until the\r\nend of the implementation period and there will be a\r\nneed to legitimize some aspects of the agreement and\r\nperhaps to complement them. There will also be a need\r\nfor United Nations assistance during the\r\nimplementation period with regard to many aspects, in\r\nparticular with regard to Palestinian refugees, including\r\nthe continuation of the work of the United Nations\r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.22\r\nNear East. We will then propose the specific\r\nreactivation of the United Nations Conciliation\r\nCommission for Palestine, which was established by\r\nresolution 194 (III) and is composed of the United\r\nStates, France and Turkey, and the use of the records of\r\nthe Commission related to land ownership in Palestine.\r\nThese records were updated by the United Nations\r\nSecretariat, in cooperation with the Committee on the\r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople, and can now be used. In any case, the need for\r\nthe United Nations will increase, and we call for\r\npreparedness for that eventuality.\r\nThere are other aspects of the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict that must be resolved in order for a\r\ncomprehensive peace to be achieved in the region. In\r\nthis context, we reaffirm the necessity of reactivating\r\nthe Syrian-Israeli track of the peace process as well as\r\nthe need for Israel to accept the principle of full\r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan to the\r\nlines of 4 June 1967. We declare our solidarity with our\r\nsister country, Syria, and support its just demands,\r\nincluding Israeli adherence to the terms of reference of\r\nthe peace process. We also express our great happiness\r\nat the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. We\r\ncongratulate the brotherly Lebanese people on the\r\nliberation of their territories and support their other\r\ndemands regarding the achievement of peace between\r\nLebanon and Israel. In this context, we affirm our\r\nagreement with regard to rejecting the resettlement of\r\nPalestinian refugees in Lebanon and the need for them\r\nto return to their homes, and, until then, we expect\r\nthem to benefit from normal living conditions.\r\nWith regard to Arab national security and the\r\nprinciple of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, we\r\nreaffirm the need for Israel to accede to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and to put\r\nall its nuclear facilities under the supervision of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. We also support\r\nattempts aimed at establishing a region free from\r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and\r\nbelieve this to be an essential condition for establishing\r\na new reality in the region, which we all seek to\r\nachieve.\r\nIn the context of the wider Arab region, the\r\nsuffering of the brotherly Iraqi people is still a source\r\nof real concern for us all. We call for a speedy end to\r\ntheir suffering. We also call for the total lifting of\r\nsanctions imposed on sisterly Libya and brotherly\r\nSudan. We also call for the peaceful settlement of the\r\nissue of the three islands between the United Arab\r\nEmirates and Iran in a way that preserves the rights of\r\nthe United Arab Emirates in these islands. We also\r\nexpress our happiness for the recent steps taken in\r\nSomalia and express our hope that the stability and\r\nreconciliation process will continue. We reaffirm the\r\nneed for efforts to be made to resolve problems\r\neverywhere, including, inter alia, those of Cyprus, of\r\nthe great African continent, particularly the Horn of\r\nAfrica, of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nof some of the surrounding countries. The resolution of\r\nsuch problems will represent an important contribution\r\ntowards placing that continent on the road to\r\ndevelopment and progress.\r\nBefore concluding I must once again express our\r\ndeep thanks to our brothers and friends everywhere,\r\nparticularly to fraternal Arab countries, Islamic\r\ncountries and non-aligned countries, as well as to all\r\nother friends for their principled and continuous\r\nsupport. Let this year be the year that will bring to an\r\nend the historical injustice that has befallen our people,\r\nand let it be the beginning of a new life in the Middle\r\nEast for all States, peoples and future generations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\n"
