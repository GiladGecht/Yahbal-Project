(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 122 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/55/345/Add.5)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform Members\r\nthat since the issuance of document A/55/345 and\r\nAddenda 1-4, Sierra Leone has made the necessary\r\npayment to reduce its arrears below the amount\r\nspecified in Article 19 of the Charter. May I take it that\r\nthe General Assembly duly takes note of this\r\ninformation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: This will be reflected in\r\ndocument A/55/345/Add.5, to be issued.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International cooperation of Sierra\r\nLeone, His Excellency Mr. Sama Banya.\r\nMr. Banya (Sierra Leone): May I, on behalf of\r\nmy delegation and the Government and people of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, add my vice to those before\r\nme to offer warm felicitations on your election as\r\nPresident of this epoch-making fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Millennium Assembly. Your\r\nlong and distinguished career in the service of your\r\ncountry and on the international scene makes you\r\neminently suitable for election. My delegation is\r\nconfident that under your able guidance, our\r\ndeliberations will be smooth and productive. Indeed,\r\nwe have seen evidence of that in your insistence on\r\npunctuality. I want to assure you, Sir, of my\r\ndelegation’s fullest cooperation.\r\nTo our brother and colleague Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab of Namibia, I convey my delegation’s gratitude\r\nand appreciation for the able manner in which he\r\nconducted the affairs of the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI should like to thank Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, and his\r\ncolleagues and staff, whose dedication to duty deserves\r\nthe highest commendation. I extend our special\r\ngratitude to Mr. Annan for his insight into the problems\r\nin my country and the objective manner in which he\r\nhas reported his findings to the Security Council. The\r\nUnited Nations Security Council has deployed over\r\n13,000 peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone, the largest\r\nnumber in any country at any one time. In\r\ncollaboration with my Government, it is setting up a\r\nspecial court to try all those who are guilty of the most\r\nhorrendous and atrocious crimes against humanity. In\r\nfurtherance of its interest in bringing stability to the\r\ncountry, it has planned to send a high-level delegation\r\nto Sierra Leone to assess the situation on the ground.\r\nI should also like to extend a warm\r\ncongratulations to Tuvalu on its admission as the 189th\r\nMember of this Organization.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nFollowing the unwarranted criminal abduction by\r\nthe Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of hundreds of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping troops of the United\r\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), a\r\npeaceful demonstration by the members of civil society\r\nof Sierra Leone was organized to appeal to Foday\r\nSankoh, the leader of the RUF, for the unconditional\r\nrelease of the hostages and to prevail upon him to\r\ncooperate in order successfully to implement the Lomé\r\nPeace Agreement, especially the Disarmament,\r\nDemobilization and Reintegration (DDR) Programme.\r\nAs soon as the demonstrators reached his\r\nresidence, Mr. Sankoh’s men opened fire on the\r\nunarmed and defenceless crowd, gunning down 20 and\r\nseriously wounding several others, two of whom later\r\ndied in hospital. Subsequent events have revealed that\r\nthe RUF had planned a bloody overthrow of the elected\r\nGovernment on the following day, 9 May 2000. This at\r\nfirst put the whole Lomé Peace Agreement in doubt,\r\nespecially Mr. Sankoh’s role as leader of the RUF.\r\nUnder the Lomé Peace Agreement, Mr. Sankoh\r\nwas appointed Chairman of the Strategic Mineral\r\nResources Commission, with the status of a vice-\r\npresident; he used this position to open secret\r\nnegotiations with a number of people for the\r\nexploitation and sale of Sierra Leone’s diamonds,\r\nwithout reference to any other person.\r\nThe Government of Sierra Leone had signed the\r\nLomé Peace Agreement in the belief that it would put\r\nan end to the atrocities being inflicted on defenceless\r\ncivilians, especially women and children. Among other\r\nthings, it provided for the demobilization, disarmament\r\nand reintegration of former combatants into society. It\r\nprovided for the repatriation and resettlement of\r\nrefugees and internally displaced people. It also\r\nprovided for the deployment of United Nations\r\npeacekeepers (UNAMSIL) in the country. The RUF\r\nleaders have forfeited their right to benefit from the\r\nprovisions of Lomé; however, because of its other\r\nprovisions, my Government will revive the Agreement,\r\nparticularly the DDR Programme.\r\nMy Government has already expressed\r\ncondolences to the Governments of those who lost their\r\nlives during the hostage-taking. UNAMSIL is to be\r\ncongratulated for the professional manner in which it\r\nfreed the hostages. Another group of bandits, the so-\r\ncalled “West Side Boys”, had seized and held captive 1\r\nSierra Leone soldier and 10 British servicemen who\r\nwere in Sierra Leone to train a professional army which\r\nwould be responsible to the democratically elected\r\nGovernment of the country. That group refused to\r\nrelease the hostages, despite the long and patient\r\nnegotiations, and was even beginning to threaten their\r\nlives.\r\nMercifully, to everyone’s relief, the hostages have\r\nnow been rescued. Unfortunately, one member of the\r\nBritish rescue team lost his life, while another was\r\nseriously wounded. My Government has already\r\ncongratulated the British Government for the\r\nprofessionalism of the rescue team. At the same time,\r\nwe have expressed heartfelt condolences for the loss of\r\nthe life of a member of the team.\r\nAnother recent and very welcome resolution of\r\nthe Security Council is the ban on the sale of illegal\r\ndiamonds from Sierra Leone, the so-called “Blood\r\nDiamonds”. As is well known, the proceeds from this\r\ntrade have been used to fuel the rebel war machine. I\r\nwould like to thank the Government of the United\r\nKingdom, the United States of America and Canada for\r\ntheir perseverance in opposing this horrible activity,\r\ncalling things by their proper names and pointing\r\nfingers in the right direction. My country is confident\r\nthat the new arrangements for the marketing of our\r\ndiamonds will not only end the illegal trade but will\r\nalso bring sanity into the system, to the benefit of the\r\ncountry.\r\nThanks to the decisive actions of the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates under the indefatigable leadership of President\r\nObasanjo of Nigeria and President Konare of Mali,\r\nSierra Leoneans now see a real light at the end of what\r\nhas been a long and tortuous tunnel. The forthcoming\r\ntrials of those who have committed such horrendous\r\nand inhuman crimes against their fellow countrymen\r\nwill be a signal to would-be adventurers that such acts\r\nwill no longer go unpunished.\r\nNo words can sufficiently express the thanks and\r\ngratitude of the people of Sierra Leone to the Security\r\nCouncil, the international community as a whole and\r\ntroop-contributing countries. Following the occupation\r\nand destruction of economic areas, the carting away of\r\nour resources, the displacement of hundreds of\r\nthousands of our people and the wanton destruction of\r\nlife and property, I would like to appeal to all our\r\nfriends to continue and intensify their humanitarian\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nassistance and to support programmes for rebuilding\r\nour country.\r\nWe have just entered a new millennium, bringing\r\nwith us many unresolved problems — problems which\r\nhave been discussed in this and other international\r\nforums over the years and which appear to lack any\r\nsolution. We have only one world, and my delegation\r\nbelieves that it is worth our love. We should therefore\r\ndemonstrate that love by adequately addressing\r\noutstanding issues like general disarmament, nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation, peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\nprohibition and control of small arms, prohibition of\r\nlandmines, poverty alleviation, affordable drugs and\r\ntreatment of debilitating and killer diseases such as\r\nmalaria and HIV/AIDS, advancing the Middle East\r\npeace process in accordance with various Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, equitable trade negotiations and,\r\nof course, reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Surin Pitsuwan, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nThailand.\r\nMr. Pitsuwan (Thailand): On behalf of the\r\npeople and the Government of Thailand, I would like to\r\nextend my warm congratulations to you, Sir, upon your\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I am confident that under your\r\nable guidance, we shall be able to build upon the\r\nmomentum generated by the Millennium Summit and\r\nenjoy a successful and result-oriented General\r\nAssembly session.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Foreign Minister of\r\nNamibia, the President of the fifty-fourth session, for\r\nhis leadership and tireless efforts throughout the past\r\nyear. His wisdom and dedication to the tasks of our\r\nAssembly enabled him to serve as an effective bridge\r\nbetween the last session and the Millennium Summit,\r\nthus laying a firm foundation for our work this year.\r\nOn this occasion, may I, on behalf of the people\r\nand the Government of Thailand, extend a warm\r\nwelcome to Tuvalu on its admission as the newest\r\nMember of the United Nations family.\r\nThe dawn of the new millennium is a time for\r\nboth justified celebration of and sombre reflection on\r\nthe achievements and shortcomings of the United\r\nNations during the past 55 years. As we review the\r\nUnited Nations track record, I cannot but recall the\r\nvery first words written in the United Nations Charter:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations”. These few\r\nsimple words convey an idea of overwhelming\r\nsignificance — that it is the peoples of our respective\r\nnations who represent the core raison d’être of this\r\nforemost assembly of humankind. It is the peoples who\r\nshould be the primary beneficiaries of every resolution\r\nthat we adopt and every programme that we launch.\r\nAs we proceed with the first General Assembly\r\nsession of this millennium, we should ask ourselves the\r\nquestions, “Have we indeed put the peoples at the\r\ncentre of all our deliberations and activities? Have we\r\ndone enough to ensure that ordinary people, both men\r\nand women, young and old, benefit from all our\r\ninitiatives and actions, collective as well as\r\nindividual?”\r\nWe are encouraged that the Secretary-General, in\r\nhis report to the Millennium Assembly, has highlighted\r\nthe “peoples’ concerns” as one of the primary agenda\r\nitems for the international community to take up. And\r\nwe are gratified that many countries have highlighted\r\nissues of direct interest to peoples at the Millennium\r\nSummit, from reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria and other diseases to combating the scourge of\r\ndrugs, from rolling back poverty to closing the\r\neducational gaps within and between countries. These\r\nare all important steps in the right direction.\r\nBut we need to do more. We need to adopt a fresh\r\nmindset that places the interests and welfare of the\r\npeoples — the peoples of our own countries and those\r\nof other nations — at the centre of our policies in\r\nsocio-economic development and in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. We need to keep in\r\nmind that promoting the interests and welfare of\r\npeoples requires that we also promote human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. We need to work collectively to\r\ntranslate commitments made at the Millennium Summit\r\nand in other forums into concrete results that reach\r\npeople directly.\r\nAlthough the recent economic and financial crisis\r\nhas brought devastating consequences to millions of\r\npeople across the Asia-Pacific region, it has helped\r\nrefocus the attention of Governments on the need to\r\nprotect the most important of any economy’s assets,\r\nnamely, its people. The crisis, by exposing the\r\ninadequacies of national social safety nets in protecting\r\nthe welfare of vulnerable peoples, has raised many\r\ndifficult questions. In essence, how can one pursue\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nsustainable development and even attempt to attain\r\neconomic prosperity when the basic needs of people\r\ncannot be fulfilled and the potentials of people not\r\nfully developed?\r\nThe idea of putting people at the centre of\r\ndevelopment efforts is not new. But its application has\r\nbeen far from widespread. As various countries slowly\r\nrecover from the economic and financial crisis in Asia,\r\nthe value of pursuing people-centred development has\r\nbecome ever greater. This development paradigm\r\nconsiders development as a means to promote people’s\r\nwelfare and interests rather than as an end in itself. It\r\nlooks beyond quantitative indicators of growth and\r\nfocuses more on how to nurture the capabilities of\r\npeople in society so that they are empowered and are\r\nable to make positive contributions to a country’s\r\ndevelopment efforts. And it needs to be forward-\r\nlooking, taking into account the interests and welfare\r\nof future, unborn generations.\r\nAs part and parcel of the efforts to pursue people-\r\ncentre development, we must put a premium on\r\ntackling those issues, national and transnational, that\r\nhave a direct impact on people’s welfare. I should\r\ntherefore like to highlight three issues in particular that\r\naffect the very essence of the welfare of our peoples:\r\ndrugs and narcotics-trafficking, HIV/AIDS and poverty\r\nalleviation through sustainable development.\r\nOne of the most unfortunate consequences of\r\nglobalization is the globalization of the drugs and\r\nnarcotics problem. Illicit trafficking in and production\r\nof narcotics erode an economy’s resources, generate a\r\nhost of social problems and undermine our human\r\npotential. These effects are widespread, from the most\r\nrural and remote of villages to the most modern of\r\nmetropolises. It is a global social problem that affects\r\npeople directly, both users and non-users. While all\r\ntypes of drugs and narcotics are a threat to society, we\r\nhope that the international community will give as\r\nmuch attention to the growing threat of\r\nmethamphethamines as it did to heroin and other drugs\r\nin the past. The small size and low cost of producing\r\nmethamphethamines make them readily accessible to\r\nall sectors of society and therefore difficult to suppress.\r\nThailand has spared no effort in tackling the drug\r\nand narcotics problem at the national level, and is at\r\nthe forefront of regional and international cooperation\r\nto meet this challenge, with the Association of South-\r\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). I am\r\npleased to announce that Thailand and UNDCP will be\r\nhosting an International Congress, “In pursuit of a drug\r\nfree ASEAN 2015: Sharing the vision, leading the\r\nchange”, in Bangkok from 11 to 13 October this year.\r\nWe hope to establish an effective coordinating\r\nmechanism to tackle the drugs and narcotics problem\r\nalong all fronts and at all levels, and we hope that the\r\ninternational community will support us in these\r\nendeavours.\r\nWe are gratified that the global problem of\r\nHIV/AIDS, which is affecting an increasing number of\r\npeople in our societies, was given due attention at the\r\nMillennium Summit. But international efforts will have\r\nto be strengthened and sustained if the international\r\ncommunity is to make a dent in a problem that has\r\nalready affected more than 36 million people\r\nworldwide and is reaching epidemic proportions. We\r\nare honoured that Thailand has been cited as one of the\r\nsuccess stories in tackling the HIV/AIDS problem in\r\nthe developing world. Nevertheless, the sustainability\r\nof successful national efforts requires strong support\r\nand cooperation at the regional and multilateral levels\r\nand effective partnerships with non-governmental\r\norganizations, including the private sector.\r\nIn this connection, we hope that regional and\r\ninternational cooperation in preventing and alleviating\r\nthe HIV/AIDS problem will emphasize the exchange of\r\nAIDS-related technologies and state-of-the-art\r\ntechniques for the prevention and alleviation of this\r\ndisease, as well as the sharing of knowledge on\r\naffordable HIV/AIDS-related drugs. We call on the\r\nSecretary-General to enhance his efforts in\r\ncoordinating international action against HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe also support the proposal for a special session of\r\nthe General Assembly in 2001 to address this problem.\r\nUplifting peoples from abject poverty and\r\nendowing them with appropriate means to lead\r\nproductive lives are the best guarantees of long-term\r\nsocial stability, and provide a secure foundation for\r\nfuture prosperity and international peace. Poverty\r\nreduction is thus at the core of people-centred\r\ndevelopment and the first step in promoting a more just\r\nand equitable global order. The tenth session of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD X), which Thailand had the honour of\r\nhosting from 12 to 19 February this year, drew\r\nparticular attention to the risks of marginalization of\r\nthe poorest countries in the global economy and of the\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nmost vulnerable groups within both developing and\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nUNCTAD is endeavouring to build a new\r\nconsensus on how to have greater equity and\r\nparticipation by all in the international economy in this\r\nera of globalization. In line with the “Spirit of\r\nBangkok” emerging from UNCTAD X, Thailand, as\r\ncurrent President of UNCTAD, greatly appreciates the\r\ninitiative by Japan during the Group of Eight (G-8)\r\nSummit in Okinawa and the G-8 Foreign Ministers’\r\nMeeting in Miyazaki in July this year to invite\r\nrepresentatives from developing countries as well as\r\nregional and international organizations to meet with\r\nthe G-8 leaders as a means to strengthen North-South\r\ncooperation. We are also very appreciative of China’s\r\ninitiative to hold a Sino-African dialogue on\r\ndevelopment cooperation soon. We are convinced that\r\nthese initiatives are a step in the right direction.\r\nI was astounded to learn that fewer than 2 per\r\ncent of the world’s population is connected to the\r\nInternet, despite all the hype, and that a large portion of\r\nmankind have never heard a dial tone. If such\r\ndiscrepancies in information (IT) and/or digital divides\r\nare not reversed soon, the developing world will be left\r\nfar behind the rest of the world. Thailand believes that\r\nwe should act in concert to maximize the benefits of IT\r\nand to ensure that the greatest possible percentage of\r\nthe world’s population is guaranteed IT access.\r\nTo this end, Thailand fully supports and\r\nappreciates the G-8 Okinawa Charter on the Global\r\nInformation Society to bridge the so-called digital\r\ndivide. We also welcome the contributions of the\r\nprivate sector, such as those of the Global Digital\r\nDivide Initiative of the World Economic Forum and the\r\nGlobal Business Dialogue on Electronic Commerce.\r\nWe hope that more, similar initiatives will be\r\nforthcoming so that we, especially the developing part\r\nof the world, can overcome the digital divide.\r\nDebt problems are also recognized as a serious\r\nobstacle to the pursuit of economic and social\r\ndevelopment, and all countries should be assisted in\r\nmanaging their debt obligations, including through a\r\ndebt standstill. Thailand therefore also supports the\r\nconvening of an international intergovernmental event\r\non financing for development next year at the highest\r\npossible level and hopes that feasible and effective\r\nmeasures can be agreed upon to generate greater\r\ninternational financial assistance to support sustainable\r\ndevelopment and to address poverty. In this connection,\r\nwe see great value in securing the active participation\r\nof the international financial and trade institutions and\r\nthe private sector, as well as all the NGOs concerned.\r\nThe most effective way to ensure poverty\r\nreduction and promote sustainable development is to\r\nempower peoples with the capacity to help themselves.\r\nAnd there is no better way to achieve this than through\r\neducation and training. Thailand thus attaches great\r\nimportance to human resources development (HRD).\r\nOur efforts are not confined to the national level but\r\nextend to a wider, regional scale. We have been at the\r\nforefront in promoting HRD in the Mekong subregion,\r\nfor we sincerely believe that the upgrading of human\r\npotential is the best way to fight poverty and ensure\r\ncloser regional cooperation and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nInternational peace and security begin at home. If\r\nwe are able to pursue an all-encompassing notion of\r\nsecurity that places the security of peoples at the apex\r\nof our considerations, if we can secure for people\r\nfreedom from want as well as freedom from fear, then\r\nthe likelihood of threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity will be drastically reduced. Human security\r\nand people-centred development are two sides of the\r\nsame coin: they each promote the welfare of peoples in\r\ndifferent ways and reinforce one another at the same\r\ntime.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the concept of human\r\nsecurity is gaining ground, even though the debates on\r\nwhat constitutes human security are by no means over.\r\nThailand believes that human security can only take\r\nfirm root if the basic needs of peoples are fulfilled and\r\npeoples are free from social and economic threats to\r\ntheir well-being. How can we begin to talk about\r\nhuman security, let alone international peace and\r\ninternational security, when 1.2 billion people in the\r\nworld live on less than 1 US dollar a day, about 90\r\nmillion children are out of school at the primary level\r\nand about 1.2 million women and children under 18 are\r\ntrafficked for prostitution each year?\r\nWe therefore advocate freeing people from want\r\nby effectively and collectively meeting the challenges\r\nposed by poverty, illiteracy, infectious disease, famine,\r\nnatural disaster, social unrest and disintegration. These\r\nare in fact the very same goals that we need to achieve\r\nin promoting people-centred development.\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nThe achievement of human security also requires\r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. We cannot support human\r\nsecurity and effectively pursue people-centred\r\ndevelopment if we are unable to ensure that people are\r\nprotected from the worst forms of abuse, suffering and\r\ndeprivation. We cannot claim to put people at the\r\ncentre of development efforts if we are unwilling to\r\ncreate political conditions whereby people are able to\r\npursue their lives free from threats to their dignity and\r\npersonal safety. We cannot expect to develop human\r\npotential to the fullest or make people effective\r\ncontributors to economic development if they cannot\r\nhave the intellectual freedom to pursue their hopes and\r\ndreams for their own future.\r\nThailand therefore calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to renew its commitment to promoting and\r\nprotecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in\r\norder to ensure that people’s interests and welfare are\r\nindeed at the centre of our policies and programmes. It\r\nis with this conviction that Thailand commits itself to\r\nplaying an active and responsible role within the\r\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights.\r\nDrawing strength and inspiration from one of the most\r\ndemocratic constitutions anywhere, we will continue to\r\ngive our full support to the efforts of the United\r\nNations aimed at the protection and promotion of basic\r\nhuman rights, freedoms and dignity.\r\nIn this connection, Thailand also calls upon the\r\ninternational community to redouble its efforts to assist\r\ndisplaced persons wherever they may be. As host to\r\nover 100,000 displaced persons and over a million\r\nillegal economic migrants, Thailand attaches great\r\nimportance to this issue and hopes that it will be\r\nresolved comprehensively and as soon as possible.\r\nWhile we seek to promote international peace and\r\nsecurity from within by building support for the\r\nadoption of the human security paradigm among\r\nnations, we should also redouble our efforts\r\ninternationally. We should engage in prompt and\r\neffective collective action at the regional and\r\nmultilateral levels to create conditions of peace and\r\nstability. At the Millennium Summit, many leaders\r\nspoke of the need and urgency of Security Council\r\nreform. In line with the increased membership of and\r\nmounting challenges to this world Organization,\r\nThailand, for one, supports the expansion of both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, based on the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical representation, efficiency and readiness to\r\nshare responsibilities.\r\nFurthermore, Thailand fully supports the reform\r\nof United Nations peace operations to ensure their\r\neffective conduct and thus the credibility of the United\r\nNations itself. As I mentioned during the Millennium\r\nSummit, we strongly support the Brahimi report on\r\nUnited Nations peace operations, for we believe that its\r\nrecommendations are right on target and constitute\r\nachievable and practical steps towards the\r\nstrengthening of United Nations peace operations\r\nworldwide. I should also add that peace operations\r\nshould be prompt and non-selective as well as being\r\ncomprehensive in nature.\r\nThailand is therefore honoured to play an\r\nimportant part in United Nations peacekeeping efforts\r\nunder the United Nations International Force, East\r\nTimor (INTERFET) and now under the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET),\r\nthrough the contribution of over 1,500 Thai\r\npeacekeepers and the role of Lieutenant-General\r\nBoonsrang Niumpradit, Force Commander of\r\nUNTAET. At the same time, Thailand has always been\r\nconscious of the value of regional cooperation in\r\nfostering peace and stability and strongly supports\r\nregional efforts aimed at confidence-building and\r\npromoting preventive diplomacy.\r\nIn this connection, we are proud of the seventh\r\nmeeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)\r\nrecently concluded in Bangkok in July, which saw the\r\nadmission of the People’s Democratic Republic of\r\nKorea (DPRK) into our forum. We warmly welcome\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Korea’s participation in the\r\nARF, the only regional forum that brings together all\r\nthe key countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We are\r\nconfident that this will strengthen the momentum for\r\nregional peace and security in the Asia and Pacific\r\nregion.\r\nIt is our fervent hope that at this first General\r\nAssembly of the twenty-first century, 55 years after the\r\nUnited Nations held its first meeting, we, the\r\nGovernment representatives of Member States, can\r\nmove forward in fulfilling our promise made in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter to serve the interests of “We\r\nthe peoples of the United Nations”. More than ever\r\nbefore, we need to remind ourselves that it is the\r\npeoples of our nations who are at the core of all our\r\nefforts, whether these be to pursue social and economic\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\ndevelopment, maintain international peace and security\r\nor promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nFor if we do not fulfil our task in advancing the cause\r\nof protecting the welfare of our peoples, who will? If\r\nwe cannot adequately promote and protect the interests\r\nof the peoples of the United Nations, then it is time to\r\nconsider other ways in which the peoples of the United\r\nNations — indeed, our own peoples — can interact\r\ndirectly with the United Nations.\r\nNow is the time. Let us rededicate ourselves to\r\nthe task that we set out to accomplish 55 years ago. Let\r\nus strive to become what we were always meant to\r\nbe — a truly representative body of “We the Peoples of\r\nthe United Nations”, acting in defence of their welfare\r\nand the advancement of their interests above all else.\r\nLet us resolve and pledge to each other that we shall be\r\neven more united, better prepared and more resilient to\r\nmeet the challenges of the new millennium together.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Chairperson of\r\nthe delegation of Turkmenistan, Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Aksoltan Ataeva.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nAllow me, Sir, to welcome you to your post and to\r\nwish you every success in your important and difficult\r\nactivities in guiding the activities of this Assembly. I\r\nshould like to say how grateful we are to Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab for his wise guidance of the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe twentieth century was in every aspect a\r\ncentury of sharp contradictions in relations among\r\npeoples and nationalities, as well as a century of\r\neconomic disaster. The most stark examples were two\r\nworld wars, scores of civil wars and the catastrophe at\r\nthe Chernobyl nuclear power station, as well as other\r\ntragedies.\r\nThe flames of war also raged in the African\r\nStates, which had gained independence in the 1960s. In\r\nCentral Asia, the Afghan wound is still bleeding, but\r\nthe most important event of the twentieth century was\r\nthe collapse of the enormous empire called the\r\nUSSR — an empire which wore the outer shell of\r\ninternational friendship but within which everything\r\nwas worm-eaten. New, independent sovereign states\r\narose from its ruins. Out of that rubble, our\r\nindependent neutral State arose — Turkmenistan,\r\nwhich from the very first days of its coming into being\r\nchose the path of goodness and justice, peace and\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe twentieth century did not resolve many of the\r\nproblems that needed resolution. Quite the contrary —\r\nthe knots of these problems have become even more\r\ntangled and their lines even more taut. They have\r\naccompanied us into the twenty-first century and now\r\nwe must unravel this tangled web and relax these taut\r\nlines. This should be the task and concern of all\r\npeoples and nationalities.\r\nOur planet is the house we share and therefore it\r\nis the duty of everyone living on this planet to keep it\r\nclean and peaceful and to achieve economic stability.\r\nIn his report submitted to the Millennium Assembly,\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations drew our\r\nattention to problems which require immediate\r\nsolution, relating to all aspects of our lives.\r\nGlobalization is the priority problem. It is an\r\ninevitable objective process, part of the general course\r\nof world development, which includes many aspects,\r\nboth positive and negative. This is a decisive trend in\r\nworld development, which affects the whole complex\r\nand multifaceted field of international political and\r\neconomic relations. In this respect, questions of\r\ninternational law and the moral and juridical aspects of\r\nrelations between countries and regions cause concern\r\nand require constant monitoring.\r\nWe must not allow some to hold sway over others\r\nor allow mankind to be programmed according to one\r\nyardstick alone, and no sovereign state should be\r\ndictated to by insistence on one development model.\r\nThis is a very serious question, because this approach\r\ncalls into question the entire system of international\r\nrelations, the legitimacy of international legal norms\r\nand the principles and purposes — indeed, the viability\r\nof — the United Nations itself as the expression of\r\nvoluntary cooperation among equal nations.\r\nThe model of political globalization based on the\r\nsupremacy of a neo-liberal philosophy is gradually\r\nstrengthening the logic of confrontational thought in\r\ninternational affairs, leading to the arm-twisting of\r\nthose who don’t recognize the new international power\r\nstructure based on humanitarian intervention and\r\nprotecting human rights, but not on the rights of\r\npeoples.\r\nTurkmenistan, like the overwhelming majority of\r\nStates, is against this approach. We are convinced that\r\nthe common progress of mankind lies not in dictating\r\none model or in a single set of laws and principles, but\r\na combination of ideas and philosophies. In this\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\ncontext, I should like to stress the importance and\r\ntimeliness of the idea put forward by the President of\r\nIran, President Khatami, of a dialogue between\r\ncivilizations. We started this century and this\r\nmillennium under such a profound symbol, and this\r\nobliges us to have respect and tolerance for a whole\r\nrange of centuries-old cultures and State systems. That\r\nis how we see the possibility for a friendly dialogue\r\namong States, peoples and individuals.\r\nWe must move away from looking for differences\r\namong us and start looking for what brings us together,\r\nwithout forgetting our specific features. That is our\r\napproach in our relations to the world and with all our\r\npartners, and this has made it possible for my country\r\nin the short period of time since our independence to\r\nbuild friendly relations with all our neighbours in the\r\nregion and to find many friends far beyond the confines\r\nof our neighbourhood.\r\nMr. El-Amine (Comoros) Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe main achievement of independent\r\nTurkmenistan was to ensure stability within our State,\r\nand this stability has been guaranteed because of the\r\nuniversal support of the programmes and tasks facing\r\nthe State, in which our people take a direct part. It is\r\nthanks to this stability that we are today successfully\r\nimplementing economic and social programmes that\r\nseek to provide well-being for our citizens.\r\nThe development of a socially oriented policy has\r\nbeen reflected in a strategy for socio-economic reforms\r\nin Turkmenistan for the period up to 2010. That\r\nprogramme envisages a continuation of the policy that\r\ngives priority to social programmes, bearing in mind\r\nthe economic realities that have emerged in the years of\r\nour independence. Today, Turkmenistan is a country\r\nthat is self-sufficient in grain and basic food products\r\nand that has implemented the main parts of its overall\r\nprogramme for economic security.\r\nIn our economic programme, we stress in\r\nparticular developing the real sector of the economy,\r\ninstitutional transformations and attracting\r\ninvestment — including foreign investment.\r\nAgriculture is our priority, as well as the fuel and\r\nenergy sectors, the chemicals industry and consumer\r\ncomplexes, transport and communications\r\ninfrastructure and a network of transnational pipelines\r\nthat export Turkmenistan’s fuel to world markets.\r\nOne of the main tasks in this coming period will\r\nbe to develop our productive potential. Here, a leading\r\nrole will be played by the fuel industry. We intend to\r\nconcentrate our efforts on labour-intensive sectors;\r\nthese are promising from the point of view of their\r\npotential and competitiveness. The economic growth of\r\nour State should guarantee the well-being of our\r\ncitizens.\r\nFrom the standpoint of ensuring sustainable\r\nsocial development and the progress and well-being of\r\nour people, regional cooperation is becoming\r\nparticularly important. In our region, we have a stable\r\nsystem for active economic interaction, provided by the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO), which\r\nconsists of 10 States with major resource and economic\r\npotential. Over the past few years within ECO we have\r\nstarted to implement some important interregional\r\ntransportation and communications projects which will\r\nbring the European and Asian countries’ economies\r\ncloser together, bridge the technological gap between\r\nthem and establish an equitable system of trade and\r\neconomic relations between the North and the South.\r\nThat same goal is currently being served by\r\nTurkmenistan’s efforts to export energy raw materials\r\nto world markets. Building pipelines is not just a\r\nquestion of profitable commercial projects; these are\r\nalso projects for the social development of our country\r\non an enormous scale, going well beyond our national\r\nconfines. Because of this, Turkmenistan is taking an\r\ninitiative to draft an international legal instrument to\r\nguarantee the safe, unimpeded transit of energy raw\r\nmaterials through major inter-State pipelines. This\r\ninstrument is necessary to make sure that the interests\r\nof the producers are taken into account, as well as\r\nthose of the transit countries and consumers, and that\r\nwe totally rule out the possibility of the use of these\r\npipelines as an instrument for political and economic\r\npressure.\r\nAnother problem that could severely damage\r\nregional stability is the question of the legal status of\r\nthe Caspian Sea. The lack of clarity on this question\r\nand the one-sided scenarios being offered impede the\r\nuse of the enormous potential of this sea. For\r\nTurkmenistan, the main point is to take into account\r\nthe interests of all riparian states in order to ensure that\r\ncooperation on the Caspian is based on mutual respect,\r\nequality and mutual benefit. Turkmenistan believes that\r\nseeking a new legal status for the Caspian Sea requires\r\nall riparian States to make some sensible compromises\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nand show a willingness squarely to face the new\r\nrealities. This process should be monitored by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nTouching on regional security, allow me to dwell\r\non the grave Afghanistan problem, which we take\r\nparticularly seriously. The history of the long-suffering\r\nAfghan people has shown that any outside interference\r\nin this domestic conflict, particularly the use of force,\r\nis futile and will only make matters worse. We are\r\nfacing a fair accompli, and in this situation we must\r\nrecognize that dialogue and cooperation with the\r\nTaliban will give more results from the point of view of\r\ntheir natural modernization than any attempts to isolate\r\nthem or to impose any kind of sanctions on them.\r\nSanctions basically work against the Afghan people.\r\nThey are therefore counterproductive.\r\nTurkmenistan favours a peaceful solution of its\r\nconflicts, and as a neutral, friendly neighbouring State\r\nis prepared actively to promote the Afghan settlement\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations. In particular,\r\nrecently, upon the initiative of the President of\r\nTurkmenistan, another initiative was taken to work out\r\nsome mutually acceptable solution to resolve this\r\nAfghanistan conflict. That was the point of the\r\nTurkmenistan mission which went to Iran, Afghanistan\r\nand Pakistan and held talks and consultations with top\r\nleaders of these countries and with the leaders of the\r\nTaliban movement and the Northern Alliance, after\r\nwhich proposals to settle the conflict were made at the\r\nrecent meeting between the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Afghanistan six plus two group.\r\nTogether with the United Nations, Turkmenistan is\r\nmaking every effort to convince the belligerents to\r\ncease fire and to sit down at the negotiating table.\r\nIn conclusion, I again assure the Assembly that in\r\nTurkmenistan the United Nations has an active\r\nMember prepared to make every effort to discharge the\r\nlofty tasks decided at the United Nations Millennium\r\nSummit. As we enter the new millennium we begin to\r\nwonder what it will be like. What awaits us in the\r\nfuture? Every person, every people, living in this world\r\nis striving for a better, more radiant future, which has\r\nto be built consistently, insistently, on the basis of\r\npeace, respect and progress. I hope that all the peoples\r\nof the world will devote themselves to that goal.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Domingo Siazon, Secretary\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Siazon (Philippines): The twentieth century\r\nwas one of great trials and great achievements. The\r\nnew century will be what we make of it. Whatever has\r\nbeen won in the name of peace, the hunting season in\r\nhistory is not quite over. Tension between nations has\r\nnot disappeared. Ethnic strife, religious extremism,\r\neconomic inequity and social injustice continue to fuel\r\nconflict. Agents of terror and transnational criminals\r\nstrike everywhere.\r\nDespite the new wealth of nations, 1.2 billion\r\npeople live on less than $1 a day. The 32 poorest\r\nAfrican countries do not earn much more than the\r\nrichest man on earth. And, despite the grinding poverty\r\nof billions, the world spends $145 per capita on\r\nmilitary forces. We must do better — much better —\r\nthan this.\r\nOur Organization received the needed impetus at\r\nlast week’s Millennium Summit. That should not be\r\nsquandered. The fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly must reflect the new global covenant for\r\npeace and progress. As always, the United Nations\r\nmust be at the forefront of this great enterprise. We are\r\nhere to lead.\r\nThe Philippine delegation sees this Millennium\r\nAssembly as a bridge to link three divides: those of the\r\npast and the future; of experience and vision; and of\r\npromise and fulfilment.\r\nFifty-five years ago our Organization arose from\r\nthe ashes of war. Some founding Member States were\r\nvery young, just recently set free from centuries of\r\ncolonial rule. All were still preoccupied with tasks of\r\nrebuilding lives and neighbourhoods shattered by the\r\nGreat War. The ideological divide was to become\r\ndeeper and wider. The foundations for the walls and\r\ncurtains that defined an era were just being laid. For\r\nthe average person then a truly global community was\r\nno more than an ideal, remote and all but removed\r\nfrom the day-to-day lives of mostly rural, agricultural\r\npopulations.\r\nNow we are all part of the global village.\r\nInterdependence is a recognized and accepted fact.\r\n“Globalization” is on the lips of everyone, sometimes\r\nwith scorn, at other times with affection, but always\r\nwith the discernment that it is the wave of the future.\r\nAbove all else, that future belongs to all the world’s\r\npeople, to both the affluent and the destitute, to both\r\nthe strong and the weak. With everyone’s direct\r\ninvolvement in charting and realizing our common\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\ndestiny, we open the door to the fullest flowering of\r\nhumanity’s potential. We also affirm human dignity.\r\n“Wiring” the world’s cities into the information\r\ngrid of the twenty-first century is indeed one wise\r\ninvestment we should be making today. But if anyone\r\nwere left out, if the “digital device” were but to echo\r\nand perpetuate social injustice on a global scale, we\r\nwould not have moved far from where we started. The\r\npast would simply repeat itself.\r\nTo empower people is to build our bridge to the\r\nfuture. The world’s leaders were therefore on the mark\r\nwhen they enshrined freedom, equality, solidarity,\r\ntolerance, respect for nature and shared responsibility\r\nas the fundamental, people-empowering values of the\r\ntwenty-first century. Now, it is this Assembly’s turn to\r\nemploy those values and take steps to achieve the\r\nspecific objectives set by the Summit for people\r\nempowerment.\r\nLet us buckle down to work and ensure that by\r\n2015 all children will be able to complete primary\r\nschooling and, beyond that date, that they have the\r\nopportunities to pursue higher levels of education. For\r\nlet us face it, education is the best tool for protecting\r\nhuman rights, promoting democracy and advancing\r\ngood governance.\r\nBut because a sound mind will work better in a\r\nsound body, let us win the battle against disease,\r\nincluding HIV/AIDS, which lays to waste millions in\r\nthe world’s poorest regions. Let us take action to\r\ndrastically reduce maternal and under-five child\r\nmortality from their horrendous current rates and to\r\nachieve the lofty goals of the “Cities Without Slums”\r\ninitiative.\r\nLet us invest in humanity. Let us launch in this\r\nAssembly nothing short of a Marshall Plan for the\r\nworld’s people. Let us build this human bridge to our\r\nfuture, now.\r\nThe United Nations has both the experience and\r\nthe vision needed for success. Our Organization has\r\nboth the privilege and the duty to lead our world into\r\nthe future with confidence. We know how to do it.\r\nTo sustain the United Nations capacity to carry\r\nout its tasks, deep institutional reforms must now take\r\nplace. A more energetic and financially stable world\r\nOrganization, led by a proactive General Assembly and\r\nstrengthened by a truly representative and transparent\r\nSecurity Council, must now emerge.\r\nFor the new covenant on peace to prosper, the\r\nUnited Nations must remain, without equivocation or\r\ndoubt, the first and last peacemaker and peacekeeper of\r\nthe world. It should also be the vanguard that\r\nchampions the rule of law in international as well as in\r\ninternal affairs.\r\nPreventive diplomacy must be our principal tool\r\nin warding off conflict. We must reduce the use of\r\nforce. But where we need to use it, as in self-defence or\r\nunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, we\r\nshould be guided by international legal norms and\r\npractice.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations should\r\nbe prosecuted with clear and well-defined mandates,\r\nadequate resources and strong international support\r\nwherever they take place. The report of the Brahimi\r\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations deserves our\r\nurgent and careful consideration.\r\nMore than ever, the United Nations must now\r\ngather together the political will of all nations to bring\r\nabout the final stage of disarmament and the much-\r\nawaited arrival of a nuclear-weapon-free world.\r\nTowards this end, we must support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call to convene a conference on nuclear\r\ndangers, actively participate in the 2001 small arms\r\nconference, negotiate a comprehensive convention\r\nagainst terrorism and progressively improve weapons\r\nand arms budget transparency measures.\r\nThe central role of the United Nations does not\r\nand should not stop at matters of international peace\r\nand security. It should also be at the heart of our efforts\r\nto promote prosperity for all. It should lead the charge\r\nagainst poverty and the efforts to halve, by 2015, the\r\nproportion of people whose income is less than one\r\ndollar a day.\r\nAlong with the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nother multilateral organizations and fora, the United\r\nNations is well placed to make important contributions\r\nto the reform of global economic and financial systems.\r\nFor our goal is not only to have a borderless world for\r\nunfettered trade and investment. We should found a\r\nglobal economic regime that builds productive\r\ncapacities, not income gaps; that promotes openness,\r\nnot corruption; that rewards enterprise, not greed.\r\nIn all these, partnerships with the private sector\r\nand with civil society are indispensable. Every man,\r\nwomen and child is our co-stakeholder and partner. For\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nwhat we are trying to build is a new global order where\r\nhuman security goes beyond mere military security;\r\nwhere law upholds human dignity and both people and\r\nState uphold the law; and where political pluralism and\r\ncultural diversity are requisite to the attainment of\r\ncommon human objectives.\r\nIn other words, peace and prosperity must rest\r\nmore on human cooperation than on anything else. For\r\nin this global village, cooperation is the only tenable\r\nway to bridge experience and vision.\r\nThe United Nations Millennium Declaration\r\nembodies our collective hope: the promise of a true\r\ncommunity of nations working together for a more\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world. We know that\r\nbetween this promise and its fulfilment lies a tortuous\r\nroad, yet we must tread its length. In this journey, the\r\nfirst and most important step we should take is to\r\nremove the greatest source of danger and discord, that\r\nis, underdevelopment. For if one is not free of want, he\r\ncannot be free of fear.\r\nIn the developing world, the toll from decades of\r\nturmoil and abject underdevelopment has been so\r\ndebilitating that only international relief can help some\r\nof us back to our feet. Many of us may cry for safety\r\nnets. But not even fish welcome life inside a net. What\r\nwe need is a new deal for the poor countries.\r\nDevelopment is particularly difficult for countries\r\nsaddled by mountains of crippling debt. Some 1.6\r\ntrillion dollars is now owed by developing countries,\r\nseveral of which have to use up to 95 per cent of their\r\nhard currency revenues to service debt. In the\r\nmeantime, development assistance is declining. This\r\nyear, grants to developing countries may total 40\r\nbillion US dollars — a mere half of what it was a\r\nquarter century ago.\r\nAs earnest for our collective future, we should\r\nhave meaningful debt relief for the world’s heavily\r\nindebted poor countries immediately. Let us also see\r\nthe fulfilment of the promises of overseas development\r\nassistance (ODA) made three decades ago. Further\r\nsteps must be taken at the third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries next\r\nyear. We must ensure its success to help our brothers\r\nand sisters in Africa, in landlocked developing\r\ncountries, in nations particularly vulnerable to natural\r\ndisasters and in least developed countries in all regions\r\nof the world. At this Assembly, we should do our\r\nutmost to guarantee that all preparations necessary for\r\nthe success of this conference are made.\r\nWe must also redeem the pledge of our leaders to\r\nmake every effort to ensure the success of the high-\r\nlevel international and intergovernmental event on\r\nfinancing for development in 2001. By investing this\r\nevent with the active participation, goodwill and\r\nexpertise of all stakeholders, including the private\r\nsector, from the preparatory stages to the plan’s\r\nimplementation, we may yet achieve what several\r\nUnited Nations Development Decades have not.\r\nThe world’s people took heart from the boldness\r\nof spirit and resolve our leaders expressed in the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration. They were\r\nreassured that we intend to take the world into the\r\nfuture as partners and not as adversaries. They wished\r\nfor clear direction from our leaders, and they received\r\nit. Now, they look to us in this Millennium Assembly\r\nfor concrete action. Let us rise to the challenge and\r\nbuild the bridges to peace and prosperity for all the\r\nunited nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency The Honourable Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral Merafhe, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBotswana.\r\nMr. Merafhe (Botswana): I congratulate the\r\nPresident on behalf of the Botswana delegation on his\r\nelection to lead the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly. He can count on our support as he\r\ndischarges his onerous responsibilities during this\r\nhistoric session and in the year that lies ahead.\r\nI also take great pleasure in saluting my brother\r\nand colleague, the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, for his outstanding leadership of the fifty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly — the last\r\nsession of the twentieth century — and for steering it\r\nto a successful conclusion.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has continued to\r\ngive a good accounting of himself as the chief\r\nexecutive of this, our United Nations. We owe him a\r\ndebt of gratitude for the manner in which he has,\r\nwithout fear or favour, led the United Nations during\r\nthe past four years.\r\nFive years ago, in this very Hall, we celebrated\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United\r\nNations. On that historic occasion, the former President\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nof the Republic of Botswana, Sir Ketumile Masire, had\r\nthis to say about the United Nations:\r\n“The United Nations has served us well.\r\nSmall States such as my own have found in the\r\nUnited Nations a vital forum for collective\r\nbargaining. It has contributed to the advancement\r\nof international cooperation in solving economic,\r\nsocial, cultural and humanitarian problems. It is a\r\ncentre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\r\nthe attainment of these common ends.”\r\n(A/50/PV.37, p. 3)\r\nBotswana’s faith in and commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations remains undiminished, and we are here\r\non the eve of the new millennium to renew that faith\r\nand to reaffirm that commitment.\r\nThe United Nations begins the new millennium\r\nheavily laden with the residual problems of the\r\noutgoing century. Even as we meet here, bloody\r\nconflicts of varying degrees of intensity and savagery\r\nare ravaging societies in many places around the globe.\r\nEndemic poverty holds sway in the developing world,\r\nin contrast with the lavish opulence of the West.\r\nDiseases, the most virulent of which is the devastating\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, have continued to cause untold\r\nmisery all over the world, particularly in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. All these problems pose a serious challenge to\r\nthe United Nations and to the international community\r\nas a whole. The character of the twenty-first century\r\nwill no doubt be determined by our ability and\r\ncommitment to face this challenge.\r\nOn the African continent, the struggle for peace\r\nand against war remains an all-consuming\r\npreoccupation. The agendas of the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council and the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) attest to this vexing state of affairs. All the\r\nefforts of the leaders of Central and southern Africa,\r\nwhich a little more than a year ago produced the\r\nLusaka Agreement aimed at bringing peace to the war-\r\ntorn region of Central Africa, have thus far come to\r\nnaught. There is no peace in the region because the\r\nAgreement remains unimplemented even as the parties\r\nhave continued to profess their fidelity to it.\r\nThe United Nations now has the authorization of\r\nthe Security Council to deploy more than 5,000\r\nobservers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\r\nmonitor the ceasefire and pave the way for the\r\ndeployment of a full-fledged peacekeeping force in the\r\nnear future.\r\nA crucial element of the Lusaka Agreement,\r\namong others, is that there must be dialogue in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, among the people\r\nof that country, if the international efforts spearheaded\r\nby the United Nations and the OAU aimed at creating\r\nconditions for national reconciliation in that country\r\nare to bear fruit. Regrettably, there is no dialogue in\r\nprocess in that country, although a facilitator has been\r\nin place for nine months.\r\nWe hope the Congolese leaders will soon realize\r\nthat without the implementation in full of the Lusaka\r\nAgreement, their country will be bereft of any hope for\r\npeace. There may be no second chance. The Lusaka\r\nAgreement is their only salvation.\r\nThe leaders of Burundi, next door to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, recently gathered\r\nin Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania, to make peace\r\nunder the facilitation of the former President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela. Their\r\ngathering in Arusha attracted the presence of leaders\r\nfrom near and far, including the President of the United\r\nStates of America, Mr. Bill Clinton.\r\nRegrettably, the peace agreement reached was\r\nembraced by some and denigrated by others, which\r\ndoes not augur well for peace in Burundi. It is our\r\nfervent hope that those who have not embraced the\r\nArusha peace agreement will do so. In having President\r\nMandela as Facilitator, the people of Burundi could not\r\nhave been more fortunate — and for the second time.\r\nBefore President Mandela, it was the late\r\nPresident Mwalimu Nyerere, may his soul rest in\r\npeace, who gave so much of himself for peace in\r\nBurundi. Burundi may not be so fortunate a third time.\r\nOn that occasion, President Clinton had this to say: “So\r\nI plead with you: you have to help your children\r\nremember their history, but you must not force them to\r\nrelive their history.” Burundi would do well to heed\r\nthese words and save its children from the scourge of\r\nendemic conflict.\r\nThe Great Lakes region of Central Africa needs\r\npeace. The neighbours of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and Burundi, all of them, will not have\r\npeace so long as carnage continues in their backyard.\r\nAngola will not have peace so long as its neighbours to\r\nthe north are strife-torn.\r\nThe United Nations is making steady progress in\r\nSierra Leone, following initial mishaps which\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nthreatened to reduce this Organization to an object of\r\nridicule. The size of the United Nations force in that\r\nsmall country should be enough to frustrate the\r\nmurderous activities of the bandits of the\r\nRevolutionary United Front (RUF). In the final\r\nanalysis, however, the future stability of Sierra Leone\r\ncannot be imposed by the United Nations or even,\r\nindeed, by the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates. It is the people of Sierra Leone themselves who\r\nmust embrace the logic of peace through national\r\ndialogue and reconciliation.\r\nThe silence of the guns in the Horn of Africa in\r\nthe tragic war between Eritrea and Ethiopia could not\r\nhave been more welcome. The region has more than\r\nenough problems without endless war. Famine is\r\nstalking the area, evoking earlier episodes of human\r\ndevastation, particularly in Ethiopia and Somalia. In\r\npeace, it is hoped the international community will be\r\nable to assist the affected areas without hindrance. Our\r\nhearts and best wishes go out to the people of Somalia\r\nin their difficult endeavour to restore normalcy to their\r\nfractured country. We hope the new central authority\r\nthey have established will be respected by all the\r\nparties in the country.\r\nThe struggle for peace in Africa, if it is to be\r\nsuccessful, must be prosecuted on two fronts —\r\npolitical and economic. On both fronts, I can assure\r\nthis Assembly that Africa is not a hopeless continent,\r\nas some of our detractors would have the world\r\nbelieve.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s seminal report on the\r\ncauses of conflict in Africa has not fallen on deaf ears.\r\nOur continent has been changing for the better for\r\nsome time now. Changing democratically elected\r\ngovernments by unconstitutional means, whatever the\r\nreason, is no longer tolerated. Coup makers are no\r\nlonger welcome in the councils of the OAU. We have\r\ncome to accept that good governance and the rule of\r\nlaw, far from being regarded as sinister neo-colonialist\r\nconcepts as some may wish to stigmatize them, simply\r\nmean accountability and transparency on the part of\r\nthose who are entrusted with the responsibility of\r\nrunning the affairs of their nations. They mean\r\ncultivating a culture of incorruptibility, openness and\r\ntolerance.\r\nOn the economic front, I cannot gainsay the\r\nobvious fact that people cannot eat democracy or good\r\ngovernance. Democracy in an environment\r\ncharacterized by abject poverty and ignorance is an\r\nendangered species. Africa needs investment and aid to\r\nbuttress its democratization process. The challenge\r\nfacing the United Nations in the new century is\r\ntherefore to strive to ensure that Africa’s difficult\r\nrenaissance is not simply encouraged but also\r\nsupported in material ways.\r\nThe western world would do well not simply to\r\nshout at Africans, to pontificate about human rights\r\nand good governance and deprecate the continent’s\r\ncivil wars and endemic instability, from the privileged\r\ncomfort of Western Europe and North America.\r\nAfricans need and deserve hands-on solidarity and\r\nconstructive engagement with the developed world if\r\nthey are to succeed in their struggle for peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nLet me state the obvious. Small States like my\r\nown derive a sense of security from our membership in\r\nthe United Nations. The United Nations is our shield\r\nagainst the vagaries and predatory nature of world\r\npolitics. That is why we have been unstinting in the\r\nfulfilment of our obligations to the Organization. We\r\npay our dues to the Organization without fail. We have\r\nparticipated in its peacekeeping activities. And we have\r\ndefended it against its many detractors.\r\nIt is no secret, however, that this United Nations\r\nto which we all habitually profess our unflinching\r\ncommitment and devotion is perpetually tottering on\r\nthe brink of insolvency. This is unfortunately so, even\r\nas we equally habitually burden the Organization with\r\nescalating tasks for it to perform on a shoestring\r\nbudget. The Secretary-General is right in challenging\r\nus, the Member States, to hold one another responsible\r\nfor the financial difficulties faced by the United\r\nNations. We alone can resolve these difficulties. We\r\nmust honour our Charter obligations and do so without\r\nconditions.\r\nWe must strengthen the United Nations in order\r\nto secure our future, the future of mankind. We must\r\ncontinually reform the Organization to adapt it to the\r\nrealities of the post-cold-war world and the new\r\nmillennium. A crucial part of this reform and\r\nadaptation is the reconfiguration of the Security\r\nCouncil, on which there is sufficient consensus in our\r\nUnited Nations family. The Council needs a heavy dose\r\nof democratization and accountability; about this, there\r\nis no dissension.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nWe must strengthen the peacekeeping arm of the\r\nUnited Nations to make good or deliver on our\r\nCharter’s pledge “to save succeeding generations from\r\nthe scourge of war ...”. Peacekeeping has always been a\r\ncrucial function of the United Nations. And so the need\r\nto enhance the rapid reaction of the United Nations to\r\nconflict situations around the world has long been\r\nrecognized and is deeply felt. The lessons in Kosovo,\r\nEast Timor and, more recently, Sierra Leone have\r\ntaught us that the United Nations needs better trained\r\nand well-equipped troops, as well as innovative,\r\nimaginative and realistic mandates from the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nLet there be no repetition of the kind of\r\nhumiliation the United Nations recently suffered in\r\nSierra Leone at the hands of a ragtag army of bandits.\r\nThe conflicts that are wreaking havoc on societies\r\ntoday are radically different from those that\r\npreoccupied the United Nations during the cold war\r\nera. We must therefore devise new and creative\r\nmechanisms and strategies for responding to them.\r\nLet me conclude my statement by reiterating\r\nBotswana’s commitment to the United Nations and its\r\nCharter. This Organization is irreplaceable, and I am\r\nsure the presence here two weeks ago of so many world\r\nleaders to mark the turn of a new millennium is more\r\nthan enough testimony to this obvious fact.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Al-Haj Abdus Samad\r\nAzad, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh.\r\nMr. Azad (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bengali): The\r\nhistoric Millennium Summit and the forward-looking\r\nDeclaration it adopted have set a very positive tone for\r\nthe Millennium Assembly, which is now continuing\r\nwith this general debate.\r\nWe extend our heartiest congratulations to\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri on his well-deserved election as the\r\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session. His deep\r\ncommitment to the values and principles of the United\r\nNations gives us the confidence that the affairs of this\r\nAssembly are in very good hands.\r\nI should also like to congratulate Foreign\r\nMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab, my dear colleague, for his\r\nsuperb leadership of the fifty-fourth General Assembly.\r\nWe are grateful to him for his invaluable guidance in\r\nthe preparations for the Millennium Summit and its\r\noutcome.\r\nMay I also express Bangladesh’s sincere thanks\r\nand gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\nvision in convening the Millennium Summit and for his\r\nuntiring efforts towards its success. His millennium\r\nreport contains a number of good proposals and ideas,\r\nwhich we wholeheartedly support. I reiterate\r\nBangladesh’s full support and cooperation to the\r\nSecretary-General in his determination to enhance the\r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.\r\nLet me at the very outset extend our heartiest\r\ncongratulations to the people and Government of\r\nTuvalu as the newest Member of this Organization.\r\nTwenty-six years ago this month, when\r\nBangladesh had just become a Member of this\r\nOrganization, the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu\r\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, addressed this Assembly. He\r\nunderscored our commitment to the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. For our people, it was a great moment.\r\nWe have travelled a long way since that time and our\r\ncommitment to the United Nations has only grown in\r\nstrength.\r\nAs Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina mentioned in\r\nher speech at the Millennium Summit:\r\n“In this Organization, the powerful and the\r\nweak, the large and the small, the wealthy and the\r\nstruggling come together as equals to address\r\ntheir problems, to forge cooperation and to\r\nfurther understanding. It certainly is in our\r\ninterest to strive for a United Nations which can\r\nfulfil our common goal — a better world for\r\nevery human being”.\r\nTo the people of Bangladesh, human rights is a\r\nsacred trust, because we were victims of its abuse. And\r\nyet the very person who had championed the cause of\r\nfundamental rights was denied the most basic of all\r\nhuman rights, the right to life. I speak of the ghastly\r\nmurder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,\r\nalong with almost his entire family and close relations,\r\nby a group of assassins on 15 August 1975. The\r\nmurderers had committed a crime and human rights\r\nabuse of the worst kind. And, in what could best be\r\ndescribed as an arrogant affront to human rights and\r\ndemocratic principles, the killers were granted\r\nimmunity from law by the so-called Indemnity\r\nOrdinance issued by the undemocratic regime of that\r\ntime.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nThe present democratic Government in\r\nBangladesh has repealed the Indemnity Ordinance\r\nsince its assumption of office. The accused have been\r\ntried and found guilty of murder, and the verdict of the\r\ncourt of law has been announced. Some of them,\r\nhowever, have managed to escape justice by finding\r\nasylum in foreign lands. If human rights is to dominate\r\nthe agenda of the new century, we would urgently ask\r\nthe international community for its cooperation in\r\nbringing these self-confessed killers to Bangladesh to\r\nface justice. Here I would like to express my\r\nappreciation and gratitude to those countries which\r\nhave been cooperating with us in this matter.\r\nTo Bangladesh, a very important manifestation of\r\nhuman rights is the right to development, which needs\r\nfurther assertion by the international community. In\r\nensuring that right, it is essential that our collective\r\nefforts focus on addressing poverty. Unless we take\r\npositive actions in this regard, globalization will be\r\nmore of a challenge and less an opportunity — freedom\r\nfrom want will remain elusive. The challenges are\r\nparticularly daunting for the least developed countries\r\nand merit priority attention.\r\nJust as globalization touches us all,\r\nmarginalization of these vulnerable countries would\r\naffect us all in the global family. We would urge the\r\ninternational community to make every effort for the\r\nsuccess of the third United Nations Conference on the\r\nLeast Developed Countries in 2001 in Brussels.\r\nIn the past decade, the international community\r\nhas made tremendous progress in recognizing the\r\nchallenges and adopting elaborate programmes of\r\nactions in the areas of social development, human\r\nrights, environment, population, human settlement and\r\nfood security, as well as on women and children. Now\r\nthe challenge before us is to fulfil the commitments we\r\nhave made together. Let us resolve that the next decade\r\nwill be the decade of implementation.\r\nAt home, in facing the challenges of the coming\r\ndecades, poverty eradication has been set as the over-\r\narching goal of the present Government of Bangladesh,\r\nunder the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\r\nWe are making increasingly great investments in our\r\npeople and in our social and human development.\r\nIn ensuring the effectiveness of this engagement,\r\nBangladesh has focused on the rights of women and\r\nchildren. Bangladesh has become party to most of the\r\ninternational instruments relating to the rights of those\r\ntwo groups. During the Millennium Summit, Prime\r\nMinister Sheikh Hasina ratified the Optional Protocol\r\nto the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women and the two Optional\r\nProtocols on the sale of children, child prostitution and\r\nchild pornography and on the involvement of children\r\nin armed conflict. Adoption of the “Woman and Child\r\nRepression Prevention Act, 2000” by our national\r\nParliament is also a major step forward in eliminating\r\nviolence against women and children.\r\nUnfortunately, our efforts towards sustainable\r\nhuman development have been set back through\r\ncalamities beyond our control. Sometimes it is natural\r\ndisasters like floods, cyclones or tidal surges.\r\nSometimes it is silent killers like dengue fever or\r\narsenic contamination of groundwater. Today, two\r\nthirds of the Bangladesh population is at risk as the\r\nresult of arsenic contamination of drinking water. The\r\nGovernment has responded to this crisis with urgency\r\nand determination; in collaboration with international\r\nagencies such as the World Bank, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO), as well as non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs). Adequate emphasis has also\r\nbeen given to ensuring alternative sources of safe\r\ndrinking water for the community.\r\nIn her statement at the Security Council summit\r\ntwo weeks ago, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\r\nemphasized that international peace and security must\r\nalso be understood in terms of human security. She also\r\nemphasized that we should prevent war crimes, crimes\r\nagainst humanity and genocide against the civilian\r\npopulation. We believe that the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court can effectively deal with\r\nthese crimes. We signed the Rome Statute last year and\r\nhave already initiated the process for early ratification.\r\nAs an elected member of the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council, Bangladesh remains committed to its\r\nobligations to maintain and preserve international\r\npeace and security. Bangladesh strongly supports\r\nenhanced effectiveness of the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations, as well as its peace-building\r\nmeasures. Bangladesh is proud to be one of the largest\r\ntroop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations, in fulfilment of our commitment to global\r\npeace and security. In this context, we welcome the\r\nrecommendations of the Brahimi Panel and look\r\nforward to their consideration by the relevant\r\nintergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat. Here we\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nwould emphasize that the resources needed for their\r\nimplementation should not in any way undermine\r\nother, already existing programmes.\r\nAn area of our common concern has been United\r\nNations sanctions, their effectiveness and their impact.\r\nIt is a matter of satisfaction that the Security Council,\r\nafter years of debate, has set up a Working Group\r\nunder Bangladesh chairmanship to study various\r\ngeneral issues related to sanctions. We are confident\r\nthat the work of the Group will help the Council to\r\nagree on measures to streamline the sanctions regimes.\r\nTo ensure peace and development, we must move\r\nahead with an agenda for real disarmament. The\r\nnuclearization of our own region in South Asia has\r\ncaused us concern. As one of the least developed\r\nregions in the world, South Asia cannot afford to get\r\ninto a race for nuclear weapons. In accordance with its\r\nconstitutional commitment to total and general\r\ndisarmament, Bangladesh took the lead in South Asia\r\nto sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) in 1996, ratifying it earlier this year. We also\r\nwere among the first in South Asia to sign the Ottawa\r\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines, which was\r\nalso ratified by us during the Millennium Summit,\r\nalong with the Convention on certain conventional\r\nweapons (CCWC) and all its Protocols.\r\nBangladesh considers peace and development to\r\nbe fundamental rights. One cannot endure without the\r\nother. The United Nations and its Member States must\r\ncontinue to espouse and promote a culture of peace.\r\nBangladesh took the initiative for the international\r\nobservance of this millennium year and the first decade\r\nof the twenty-first century as the International Year for\r\nthe Culture of Peace and the International Decade for a\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of\r\nthe World, respectively.\r\nAs we have said on earlier occasions, Bangladesh\r\nbelieves that the United Nations should be prepared to\r\nrespond effectively to the challenges of the new\r\ncentury. Since United Nations reforms were initiated\r\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a lot has been done,\r\nbut much more could be added to this. We aspire to\r\ngreater democratization and transparency in the\r\norganizations of the United Nations. We also believe\r\nthat involvement by non-governmental organizations\r\nand other actors of civil society can significantly\r\nenhance the effectiveness of the United Nations.\r\nA changed world needs a changed United\r\nNations — an Organization for today’s world. We need\r\nto demonstrate courage and determination in order to\r\npreserve the United Nations as the world’s most\r\nuniversal forum. Its founding fathers spoke about the\r\nscourge of war. Today the United Nations will only live\r\nup to the global reality if it cannot only free the world’s\r\npeople from the scourge of war but also save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of poverty.\r\nMay Bangladesh live forever.\r\nMay the United Nations live forever.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Jaswant Singh,\r\nMinister for External Affairs of India.\r\nMr. Singh (India): India congratulates Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri on his election as President of the first General\r\nAssembly of this millennium. We are encouraged that\r\nhe intends to take the Millennium Declaration as the\r\nmandate for the work of the Organization during his\r\npresidency.\r\nI take this opportunity to sincerely compliment\r\nand to place on record our high appreciation of Foreign\r\nMinister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for his\r\nguidance of the General Assembly in the past year,\r\nwhich included three special sessions and, of course,\r\nmeticulous preparations for and a successful\r\nconclusion to the Millennium Summit.\r\nI join India’s voice to those of other delegations\r\nin noting with appreciation the dedication with which\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has served the United\r\nNations at a critical point.\r\nI am delighted on this occasion to warmly\r\nwelcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nJust 10 days ago, almost 150 heads of State and\r\nGovernment assembled here for the Millennium\r\nSummit. Their assembly in such large numbers was as\r\nunique as was the occasion itself. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration that was then adopted encapsulates a\r\nshared vision that the international community work\r\ntogether in constructive cooperation to meet collective\r\nchallenges, within the framework of the United\r\nNations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Minister\r\nspoke, as did many others, of the need for the United\r\nNations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, to make it an effective instrument to translate\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nour vision into reality. The United Nations is the house\r\nthat we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure that\r\nit is equal to our collective expectations and our joint\r\naspirations.\r\nPeace, collective security and development\r\ninspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter the\r\ntwenty-first century with extraordinary collective\r\nintellectual and technical capabilities. These are our\r\nglobal tools for overcoming the challenges before us.\r\nPeace and security for all is not just possible but is well\r\nwithin our grasp. Stability and development are the\r\nessential building blocks for the maintenance of peace\r\nand security. Threats to peace can and do arise from\r\ndifferent sources. It is not just weapons of mass\r\ndestruction or an arms race that endanger peace, but\r\nalso dehumanizing poverty and lack of development.\r\nWe must act as confident nation States committed\r\nto collective action and international cooperation, for\r\nthese are our means to provide wider effects of peace\r\nand progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respect\r\nfor State sovereignty and non-interference in internal\r\naffairs of countries. Thus, self-evidently, we must\r\nabjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstances\r\nwarrant action by the Security Council, that action\r\nmust be firmly rooted in Charter provisions.\r\nThe Brahimi Panel’s report contains a number of\r\nproposals. We recommend that the General Assembly\r\nexamine this important report carefully and take\r\nappropriate decisions to strengthen this vital United\r\nNations function of peacekeeping.\r\nWe support the Middle East peace process and\r\nfind the trend encouraging.\r\nThe historic summit between the Republic of\r\nKorea and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,\r\ntoo, augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula.\r\nDisarmament — global nuclear disarmament in\r\nparticular — is essential to engender a greater sense of\r\nsecurity among Member States. India has been and will\r\ncontinue to be in the forefront of efforts towards global\r\nnuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation.\r\nWe welcome the recommendation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report to the Millennium Summit to\r\nconvene an international conference on eliminating\r\nnuclear danger. We urge commencement of\r\nnegotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bring\r\nabout a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remains\r\nready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps,\r\nsuch as de-alerting of nuclear forces, thus lowering\r\nnuclear danger, through accidental use or otherwise, as\r\nwell as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non-\r\nuse of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon\r\nStates.\r\nThe situation with regard to the entry into force\r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme of\r\nwork at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva\r\nshow the importance of building a consensus, both\r\nwithin and amongst nations, on issues that affect\r\nnational and international security. We are conscious\r\nthat 155 countries are at present signatories of the\r\nCTBT. We reiterate to them our continuing\r\ncommitment that India does not wish to stand in the\r\nway of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteered\r\nto observe, and continues to observe, a moratorium on\r\nfurther explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basic\r\nobligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready to\r\nengage in meaningful negotiations in the Conference\r\non Disarmament, including on a global treaty to ban\r\nthe future production of fissile material for weapons\r\npurposes.\r\nThe illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of\r\nsmall arms, particularly by States to non-State actors\r\nand to terrorist groups, and their intrinsic linkage with\r\nterrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deep\r\nconcern to the world community. When they are\r\ncombined with religious fanaticism and military\r\nadventurism, a threat is posed to the global civilized\r\nnorms to which we strive to adhere. The international\r\ncommunity can no longer afford to permit these\r\npurveyors of death, outrage and destruction to continue\r\nto inflict untold suffering upon innocents. We look\r\nforward to a successful outcome of the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next year.\r\nTerrorism is the global menace of our age. For\r\nsome, it tends to replace ideology and policy. India has\r\nbeen the object of State-sponsored, cross-border\r\nterrorism in its most inhuman manifestations for more\r\nthan a decade. Even as the international community\r\nworks together to curb, control and stamp out the illicit\r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, we need to\r\ncontinually focus our attention on the users of such\r\nweapons — the terrorists. Terrorism is an assault on\r\nhuman decency, a violation of the basic precepts of\r\ndemocracy and the very antithesis of what the United\r\nNations represents and stands for. Because its principal\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\ntargets are the innocent, it is indeed the most flagrant\r\nviolation of basic human rights. It constitutes a crime\r\nagainst humanity. It is also a threat to international\r\npeace and security, especially when terrorists are\r\narmed, financed and backed by Governments or their\r\nagencies.\r\nI urge all Members to work to strengthen the\r\ninternational consensus and legal regimes against\r\nterrorism. We have proposed the draft of a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. I\r\nurge all Members of the United Nations to give their\r\ntotal support to this initiative.\r\nLet me now dwell briefly on the instrument of our\r\nchoice to accomplish our global agenda: the United\r\nNations. There is but one United Nations; none\r\nreplicate it, nor can any replace it.\r\nThe membership of the United Nations has\r\nincreased manifold in the last half century, and today\r\nstands at 189. Yet the Security Council continues to\r\nhave the same basic structure as in the colonized world\r\nof 1945. The need for expansion of the membership of\r\nthe Security Council in both permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories is self-evident. The impact of\r\nactions of the Security Council is felt, with near total\r\nexclusivity, by the developing countries. Yet they have\r\nlittle influence in its decision-making. We have a\r\nglobal consensus that the form taken by the Security\r\nCouncil in the aftermath of the Second World War is\r\noutmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an\r\nenlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit more\r\nthan 150 States, at the highest level, endorsed the need\r\nfor a Council reformed in its representation. An\r\nunrepresentative Security Council will lack the range\r\nand depth of sensitivity, perceptiveness and\r\nunderstanding of the realities that it will have to deal\r\nwith or the moral authority to take decisions. I reaffirm\r\nIndia’s willingness to take on the responsibilities of\r\npermanent membership.\r\nThe General Assembly is the most important\r\norgan of the United Nations. It is here that all States,\r\nirrespective of considerations of strength, economy or\r\nsize, sit together as equals, embodying the democratic\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality. There is a growing\r\nfeeling among Member States that the functioning and\r\nrole of the General Assembly has to be made more\r\neffective. As the revolutions of the digital age reduce\r\ndistance to the click of a mouse, bringing us together\r\ninto a new global neighbourhood as never before in\r\nhistory, and as forces of globalization inexorably lead\r\nus to increasing interdependence, our canvas of\r\ninternational cooperation and collective action has\r\nrapidly expanded. It has also become vastly more\r\ncomplex. The General Assembly has therefore to be\r\ncentral in accepting this new responsibility, this new\r\nchallenge.\r\nEven as we week to strengthen democratic\r\nprinciples and practices in the United Nations, and\r\neven as the spreading sweep of democracy casts aside\r\ndictatorships and authoritarian regimes, we have\r\nunfortunately witnessed some instances of regression\r\nas well. Such acts move against the currents of our\r\ntimes. The international community should oppose\r\nthese assaults on the spirit of our times and\r\nuncompromisingly support and strengthen democratic\r\nimpulses, practices and norms. It should show its\r\nsolidarity with the people of such countries. The\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Commonwealth\r\ndeserve our commendation for the steps they have\r\ntaken in this regard.\r\nDevelopments in Fiji since 19 May this year have\r\ncaused us deep concern. We appreciate the action taken\r\nby the Commonwealth after the overthrow of the\r\nconstitutionally elected democratic Government there.\r\nWe hope that Fiji will return immediately to the\r\nconstitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by law\r\nat the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racial\r\ndiscrimination. This is in Fiji’s own long-term interest.\r\nWe hope that the international community will exercise\r\nits collective authority and influence to bring Fiji back\r\nto the road of democracy and the rule of law.\r\nIt appears, sadly, that the world has forgotten\r\nAfghanistan. The fratricidal conflict in that country\r\ncontinues on account of the Taliban’s pursuit of the\r\nmirage of military success. It also continues because of\r\noutside support, military and financial, to the Taliban.\r\nThis conflict and the Taliban’s mediaeval obscurantist\r\nideologies continue to cause untold suffering to the\r\nAfghan people. This adversely affects the peace and\r\nsecurity of the entire neighbourhood, from West to\r\nCentral Asia to South Asia. The negatives that emanate\r\nfrom the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, in\r\nthe shape of terrorism, drug trafficking and the flow of\r\narms, cause justifiable concern all over the world. The\r\nTaliban and their mentor must heed the world’s\r\ndemands and abandon the path of conflict. We stand for\r\na comprehensive settlement in Afghanistan that\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nrestores peace at the earliest and ensures the interests\r\nand aspirations of all sections of that society.\r\nWe have consistently called upon the United\r\nNations to increase its development orientation and\r\nengagement, which is a core responsibility. We\r\nwelcome and support the declaration of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral last week to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme’s ministerial meeting that deficit in\r\ndevelopment will put in jeopardy all other goals of the\r\nUnited Nations. To address the root causes of poverty\r\nmeaningfully, we need firm international commitments\r\nto re-order and reshape international relations, in\r\nconsequence providing for equitable opportunities to\r\ndeveloping countries for resource earnings. Our call is\r\neven more relevant in today’s fast integrating world.\r\nDeveloping countries and their people cannot\r\nthrive on a diet of advice and goodwill alone. We\r\ntherefore hope that the forthcoming conference on\r\nfinancing for development would endorse concrete\r\ninitiatives for mobilization of the required external\r\nresources for development, whether from trade or\r\nconcessional flows, and treat this as a shared global\r\ngoal. In this context, it would be useful to establish the\r\ndifference that would be made if there was universal\r\nadherence to the agreed official development\r\nassistance(ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of Gross\r\nNational Product(GNP), within a specified time frame.\r\nNowhere is this more important than in the\r\ncontinent of Africa. Africa’s efforts need to be\r\nadequately supported by the international community.\r\nWe believe that issues relating to the development of\r\nAfrican countries must remain at the forefront of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly.\r\nThe process of globalization, with revolutionary\r\nleaps in communications and the great advance in\r\ninformation technology and increased mobility of\r\ncapital, trade and technology, has produced new\r\npotential for sustained economic growth. The benefits\r\nof globalization have, however, not percolated to the\r\nvast sections who live mired in poverty, without\r\nshelter, in hunger and in deprivation. Globalization has\r\noften been accompanied by enhanced poverty,\r\nunemployment and consequent social disintegration.\r\nThis poses a major challenge. We have to determine an\r\ninclusive concept of growth and development. We have\r\nto strive for the uplifting of people in the largest sense,\r\nand not simply in terms of sectoral advances. While\r\nGDP growth rates and selective indicators may point to\r\ngrowth in an economy, the elimination of poverty and\r\nenhancement of the quality of life and creation of real\r\nchoices must be integral to the process of assessing the\r\nsuccess of development efforts.\r\nIn India, we have formulated development\r\nstrategies on the premise that economic and social\r\npolicies must subserve the primacy of the human being,\r\nand in particular the poorest. Market forces and growth\r\nalone are not the answer. Intervention to guarantee\r\nsocial justice is crucial. Development based on uneven\r\nrewards will not be supported by those who are not its\r\nbeneficiaries. It places great stress on the social fabric.\r\nThe fullest possible participation of the people in the\r\ndevelopment process is the best guarantee for the\r\nsuccess of any growth strategy.\r\nMany challenges lie ahead of us. Impediments to\r\nsustained economic growth for developing countries\r\nabound. Protectionist tendencies in developed\r\ncountries, a lack of political will to implement\r\ncommitments undertaken regarding development\r\nfinance and tardy alleviation of the debt burden of\r\ndeveloping countries aggravate the situation. Special\r\nand differential treatment for developing countries\r\nguaranteed under World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nprovisions must be translated into operational reality.\r\nDeveloped countries should not seek to restrict market\r\naccess to goods and services and free movement of\r\nnatural persons, especially at a time when developing\r\ncountries are being asked to open up their economies\r\nand compete in the international economic domain.\r\nAnother challenge relates to reconciling the needs\r\nof economic and industrial growth with the need for\r\npreservation and protection of the environment. A safe\r\nand healthy environment for our peoples is an\r\nimperative. At the same time, all development cannot\r\nbe sacrificed at the absolutist altar of environmental\r\npreservation. Sustainability of growth strategy and\r\nenvironmental conservation cannot and should not\r\nimply maintenance of poverty.\r\nDeveloping countries have done commendable\r\nwork in the implementation of Agenda 21, in the\r\ncontext of an exceptionally difficult global\r\nenvironment. The promised resources from developed\r\ncountries have failed to materialize. The transfer of\r\ntechnologies on preferential and concessional terms has\r\nnot been forthcoming. Indeed, impediments are placed\r\non technology transfer even on commercial terms. The\r\nspecial session of the United Nations General\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nAssembly on the review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 in 2002 should\r\nconcentrate on finding solutions in addressing such\r\nunfulfilled commitments and providing reality and\r\noperational content to the declaration that “eradication\r\nof poverty is the over-riding priority of developing\r\ncountries”.\r\nChildren and issues relating to them are a priority.\r\nWe hope that the special session of the General\r\nAssembly next year will concentrate on the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of the World\r\nSummit on Children.\r\nAdvancement of the democratic spirit and\r\novercoming challenges to it, growth with equity,\r\neconomic development with social justice and, as the\r\nprize that we seek, the creation of a world where\r\ninjustice and deprivation give way to fulfilment and\r\nwelfare for all are among the goals that we should set\r\nfor ourselves at the dawn of this new century. The\r\nchallenge is nothing less than collective enlightened\r\nglobal ownership.\r\nThe General Assembly once again faces a heavy\r\nand challenging agenda on this long road before us. Let\r\nus wish ourselves success in our endeavours.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Clément Rohee, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. Rohee (Guyana): Still fresh in our minds is\r\nthe strong plea made by the leaders of the world at\r\ntheir historic meeting on the eve of this fifty-fifth\r\nAssembly for a universal recommitment to\r\nmultilateralism and to the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations. Their Declaration at the Summit’s\r\nend was unanimous and unambiguous. Humanity’s\r\nfuture lies in the hands of this Organization and its\r\nability to create a new global order for the promotion\r\nof peace and development. It is a conclusion which the\r\nAssembly must take to heart if it is to fulfil this urgent\r\nmandate.\r\nI am confident that our task will be facilitated by\r\nour President’s skilful direction. Coming from Finland,\r\na country that has been forged by history on the anvil\r\nof political, economic and social endurance, he will\r\nundoubtedly bring to bear on our deliberations a sense\r\nof purpose and urgency. In congratulating him on his\r\nelection, Guyana pledges a readiness to cooperate to\r\nmake this Assembly abundantly successful.\r\nMy delegation also offers its appreciation and\r\nthanks to His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for the\r\nable leadership he provided the fifty-fourth General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOur gratitude is also due to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, who continues to manage the Organization\r\nwith a sure and steady hand. The report that he\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly, “We the peoples — the role\r\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century”,\r\namply addresses the many important challenges that lie\r\nahead of us. It is well worth our study to see what\r\nmeasures the Assembly can take to promote global\r\npeace and development through strengthening of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs the report demonstrates, a high level of\r\ntension now exists in the governance of the global\r\neconomy. While it has been generally acknowledged\r\nthat markets offer opportunities for growth and\r\ndevelopment, there is still the caveat against excessive\r\nreliance on them. As many developing countries have\r\ndiscovered, the market is often blind to their particular\r\ncircumstances and needs. Their concerns have raised\r\nserious questions about the fairness of the trading\r\nsystem, leading to much public protest, as was\r\ndramatically expressed in Seattle and almost every city\r\nwhere the Bretton Woods institutions and the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) have tried to hold meetings.\r\nThe message is clear: the international\r\ncommunity must find a consensus on ways and means\r\nto ensure more democratic governance in international\r\naffairs so that the developing countries can have a\r\ngreater say in shaping their own future.\r\nThe gap between the richest and poorest countries\r\nhas widened so dramatically during recent years that\r\nstrong and urgent action must be taken to avoid a major\r\nhuman disaster. For most developing countries such as\r\nmy own, a scarcity of financial and human resources\r\nplaces serious constraints on the policy options they\r\nare able to exercise. Despite the fact that many have\r\nembraced market-based reforms and democratic\r\ngovernance, they have had limited success in\r\nimproving the socio-economic conditions of their\r\npeople.\r\nTheir efforts to undertake important reforms and\r\nto lift themselves up by their boot-straps have been\r\nrewarded by a denial of much-needed assistance to\r\nsustain the progress achieved. The hostile international\r\nenvironment in which they find themselves not only\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nfrustrates their economic and social development but\r\nalso renders the strengthening of the democratic\r\nprocess extremely difficult.\r\nThus, while globalization has benefited strong\r\neconomies, it has weakened many developing countries\r\nand forced them into the backwaters of development.\r\nSevere economic and social dislocation has followed in\r\nmany cases, accentuating the particular vulnerabilities\r\nof small economies, many of which are often\r\ndependent on a single agriculture crop for the\r\nlivelihood of their peoples. While the proponents of\r\neconomic liberalization contend that the market offers\r\n“a level playing field”, they conveniently forget and\r\nfail to realize that the players are not equally matched\r\nand that the rules of the game are stacked in favour of\r\nthe strong. The weak can hardly compete and are\r\neventually marginalized. Indeed, it is a zero-sum game,\r\nwhere both winners and losers are known in advance.\r\nThe majority of developing countries continue to\r\nbe crippled by weak infrastructure such as roads,\r\ncommunications and other physical requirements and\r\nthe inadequacy of skilled labour to take advantage of\r\nopportunities in the market. Moreover, they must face\r\nnot only high production costs but also low prices and\r\ninadequate access to markets. Trade liberalization has\r\nalso led to a rapid growth in imports by developing\r\ncountries, while their own exports remain sluggish and\r\ntheir trade deficit widens. In the process, Governments\r\nlose much-needed revenues from duties and taxes,\r\nwhich hitherto made an appreciable contribution to the\r\nnational budget.\r\nMeanwhile, official development assistance has\r\nfallen to its lowest since the target of 0.7 per cent of\r\nGross National Product (GNP) was established by the\r\nUnited Nations in 1970. Only four countries —\r\nDenmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden —\r\nhave reached the mark. On average, developed\r\ncountries contribute less than a third of this target\r\nfigure, with the richest countries contributing even less.\r\nAssistance is now apparently seen by some as both\r\nwasteful and wasted, a perception which may serve to\r\nexplain this rapid decline. Yet for many of the poor\r\ndeveloping countries, such assistance is indispensable\r\nif they are to improve their economic performance. To\r\nmake matters worse, they find it difficult without the\r\nrequisite technology and human resource base to attract\r\nforeign direct investment, which is increasingly\r\nconcentrated in a small number of emerging\r\neconomies.\r\nThe challenge facing the international community\r\nand policy-makers in the new millennium, therefore, is\r\nto redress these inequities in the global economy in a\r\ncomprehensive and sustainable manner so as to ensure\r\nthe smooth integration of developing countries, in\r\nparticular the smaller economies, into the globalizing\r\nworld economy. Developing countries are not asking\r\nfor charity — merely the opportunity to develop their\r\npotential and to take their rightful place in the\r\ninternational community. As they have said, they\r\nrecognize their primary responsibility for their own\r\ndevelopment. They ask only for assistance in creating a\r\ndomestic environment that will enable them to\r\nparticipate fairly in the global economy.\r\nA helpful measure would be to integrate\r\ntransition periods into current economic models and\r\nmake provisions for targeted assistance to small\r\neconomies. Another would be to provide significant\r\ndebt relief and debt cancellation as necessary, together\r\nwith development assistance to boost the overall\r\nproductive capability of developing countries.\r\nDeveloped countries could also assist in\r\npromoting regional integration, as well as South-South\r\ncooperation, to allow developing countries to benefit\r\nfrom the many complementarities that they possess.\r\nEqually indispensable is the provision of new and\r\nadditional resources through the establishment of a\r\nglobal development fund that would help to bridge the\r\ngap between the developed and developing worlds. An\r\naction-oriented programme, somewhat along the lines\r\nof the post-Second World War Marshall Plan, is\r\nnecessary to achieve meaningful progress.\r\nPolicies aimed merely at creating unsustainable\r\nsocial safety nets are hardly lasting solutions. The root\r\ncauses of the social and endemic problems of the\r\ndeveloping countries, which ultimately lead to global\r\ninstability, must be addressed. To this end, we must\r\nfind a way to direct aid and investment into building\r\ncapital, both human and physical. We cannot speak\r\nseriously of closing the digital divide in an\r\nenvironment in which many Governments are\r\nstruggling to meet even the most basic needs of their\r\npopulations and where degraded infrastructure does not\r\nsupport a “communications revolution”.\r\nIn this context, we have noted the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to forge a global compact between\r\nthe United Nations, the private sector and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in an effort to maximize\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nthe development effort. Such a strategic alliance can\r\nindeed enhance cooperation on a wide array of global\r\nissues, including aid, trade and investment, and\r\nprotection of the environment as well as satisfy urgent\r\neducation, health and housing needs. To succeed,\r\nhowever, such a compact must be based on mutual\r\nunderstanding and respect through a clear definition of\r\nthe respective roles of the partners. There must be\r\ncommon objectives and agendas, as well as a clear\r\ndefinition of the roles of each partner.\r\nFinally, the international community, and more\r\nparticularly the developed North, must recognize the\r\nclose link between freedom from want and freedom\r\nfrom fear — between development, peace and stability.\r\nAt the national level, we know that good governance\r\nmust be practised to ensure that the population are\r\nprotected from all forms of oppression and allowed to\r\nenjoy their inalienable human rights. Correspondingly,\r\nat the international level, the principles of the Charter,\r\nas well as the laws which we, as civilized nations, have\r\ncome to accept, must be respected to provide an\r\nenvironment conducive to development.\r\nIn chapter IV of his report the Secretary-General\r\nremarks:\r\n“Economic globalization has largely eliminated\r\nthe benefits of territorial acquisition, while the\r\ndestructiveness of modern warfare has increased\r\nits costs.” (A/54/2000, para. 192)\r\nThis lesson must be learned by States which, despite\r\ntheir professed commitment to the Charter, often resort\r\nto various forms of coercion in international relations.\r\nThe United Nations, and more particularly the Security\r\nCouncil, should not — and, indeed, must not —\r\ntolerate such actions. All disputes must be resolved\r\nthrough peaceful means.\r\nWhile many of the proposals made by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report will undoubtedly help\r\nto contain the threats to peace and development in the\r\ntwenty-first century, we rather fear that they will be\r\ninsufficient to meet our requirements if they are\r\npursued in a piecemeal fashion without a more\r\ncomprehensive and holistic framework. It is for this\r\nreason that Guyana sought the inclusion on this year’s\r\nagenda of an item on promoting a new global human\r\norder. Time does not allow me to provide the details of\r\nthis initiative. However, so that the concept may be\r\nmore fully understood and widely supported, I have\r\nasked that, along with copies of my statement, an\r\nexplanatory memorandum outlining the aim of our\r\nproposal be circulated. Very shortly we will also make\r\navailable a more extensive document that could serve\r\nas the basis for discussion in plenary session. It is our\r\nhope that out of this consideration will emerge a\r\nresolution that expresses the determination of the\r\ninternational community to find a consensus on the\r\nway forward to securing global peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe time is now opportune, I believe, for us to\r\nsummon up our collective political will to devise a\r\ncommon and cogent strategy for managing the global\r\nagenda in the twenty-first century. Should we fail to\r\nheed this imperative, we will continue to plough the\r\nsea and reap only disillusionment and despair. This\r\nMillennium Assembly affords us a singular opportunity\r\nto define the terms and conditions of a new global\r\npartnership. Let us not waste it in futile debate, but,\r\nrather, use it to give new hope to our peoples for a\r\nbetter future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, Minister of External\r\nRelations of the Sudan.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure at the outset to convey to Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri on behalf of my delegation our congratulations\r\non his election as President for this session. Aware of\r\nhis well-known diplomatic experience and skill, we are\r\nconfident that he will lead the work of this session to\r\nsuccess. I should also like to express our appreciation\r\nand admiration for the role played by his predecessor,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia,\r\nduring his presidency of the previous session, and for\r\nhis co-chairmanship of the Millennium Summit.\r\nIn this respect, I commend the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his remarkable efforts in preparing\r\nfor the Millennium Summit and the Millennium\r\nAssembly.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I also welcome the\r\nState of Tuvalu as a new Member of our Organization.\r\nLast week, the Millennium Summit endorsed a\r\nhistorical declaration that laid out a strategy for\r\nmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nToday I should like to stress that it is our duty to\r\nconcentrate, during this Millennium Assembly and\r\nthrough its different forums, on translating that vision\r\ninto decisions and resolutions to achieve and\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nconsolidate international peace and security, total\r\ndisarmament of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nresolution of environmental problems, combating\r\ninternational terrorism and organized international\r\ncrime, prevention of conflicts before they erupt and\r\nresolution of the problems of poverty and socio-\r\neconomic backwardness. If we succeed during this\r\nsession, we can then say that we have contributed to\r\ncreating circumstances conducive to the achievement\r\nof human security and have liberated mankind from\r\nfear and want.\r\nOn the other hand, we believe that this\r\nMillennium Assembly should give equal importance to\r\nthe reform of the institutions of the United Nations, as\r\nthey represent the mechanisms through which the\r\ninternational community coordinates the\r\nimplementation of plans for achieving international\r\npeace and security, comprehensive sustainable\r\ndevelopment and prosperity for mankind.\r\nAt the apex of these institutions stands the\r\nSecurity Council. All countries continue to call for its\r\nreform by expanding its permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership, in order to make it more representative of\r\nthe current membership of the United Nations. They\r\nalso call for reform of the Council’s working methods\r\nand decision-making mechanisms, in order to render it\r\nmore democratic and transparent.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s view, expressed\r\nin his report to the Millennium Summit, that the main\r\nchallenge we face today is how to transform\r\nglobalization into a positive power that benefits all the\r\npeoples of the world. The great scientific and\r\ntechnological achievements of the last millennium\r\nconstitute the common heritage of mankind. We call on\r\nthe international community to work out the necessary\r\nguarantees to prevent these achievements from being\r\nturned into a monopoly of knowledge or cultural and\r\nintellectual domination or from being used as a means\r\nto achieve political and economic hegemony or widen\r\nthe scientific and technological gap between countries\r\nof the North and countries of the South. While we\r\nwelcome protection of these scientific and\r\ntechnological achievements as elements of intellectual\r\nproperty, we call upon our development partners to\r\nmake this great wealth available to all humanity and to\r\nenable the developing countries to use such innovations\r\nin overcoming the chronic problems of production,\r\nfood, health, education and the environment.\r\nThe right to development is a basic human right.\r\nIn order to guarantee that right it is imperative that we\r\nestablish a democratic, just and transparent world\r\neconomic order that ensures fair terms of trade between\r\npoor and rich countries, increases the level of official\r\ndevelopment assistance to poor countries and alleviates\r\nthe debt burden crushing those countries. This is the\r\nonly viable means to enable the developing countries to\r\nbenefit from the aspects and opportunities that\r\nglobalization and the revolution in information\r\ntechnology offer — benefits that are still monopolized\r\nby a very small minority of the population of our\r\nglobe.\r\nIn this regard, Sudan looks forward to the United\r\nNations financing for development event and the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries, which are scheduled to take place next year.\r\nWe sincerely hope that their results will receive the\r\neffective implementation they deserve by all United\r\nNations agencies.\r\nThis year the General Assembly convened two\r\nspecial sessions to follow up the results of the Beijing\r\nWorld Conference on Women and the Copenhagen\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development. Despite the\r\nremarkable achievements realized by national\r\nGovernments and the international community in\r\nimplementation of the commitments contained in the\r\ndocuments resulting from those gatherings, the\r\nmajority of those commitments were not realized, for\r\nseveral reasons, foremost being the failure to fulfil the\r\nfinancial commitments undertaken in Beijing and\r\nCopenhagen and the excessive debt burden and debt\r\nservice commitments of the developing and least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWe also call for more support for efforts made by\r\ndeveloping countries to eradicate ever-increasing\r\npoverty and all pandemic and epidemic diseases such\r\nas malaria and HIV/AIDS, especially in Africa.\r\nSudan looks forward to participating effectively\r\nin the World Conference against Racism to be held next\r\nyear in South Africa. We believe that this important\r\nconference will help us tackle crucial issues very dear\r\nto the human race. My country also intends to\r\nparticipate in the special session of the General\r\nAssembly to review the results and achievement of the\r\ngoals of the World Summit for Children.\r\nRecently, the President of the Republic of Sudan\r\nestablished an advisory body, attached to his office, in\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\ncharge of women’s and children’s affairs. This step is\r\nyet further proof of the special importance that the\r\nPresident attaches to the issues of women and children\r\nand his incessant work to strengthen achievements in\r\nthis field.\r\nWe view with great interest the report (A/55/305)\r\nof the Panel of Experts prepared by Mr. Brahimi on\r\npeacekeeping operations, because of its importance and\r\nthe new ideas and proposals it contains on the\r\ncontainment and prevention of conflicts and on\r\npeacekeeping operations. Our delegation will certainly\r\nparticipate in the discussion of this report in the\r\nGeneral Assembly and relevant Committees. In this\r\nconnection, we emphasize the need to set clear\r\nmandates for peacekeeping operations, ensuring the\r\nconsent of the country receiving peacekeeping\r\noperations and providing the necessary resources for\r\nsuch operations in order to ensure their success and to\r\navoid any possible dangers and setbacks.\r\nMy delegation expresses its deep concern about\r\nthe difficulties facing the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast. In this respect, we reiterate the importance of\r\ntotal Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab\r\nterritories in accordance with United Nations\r\nresolutions, in order to enable the Palestinian people to\r\nrestore full sovereignty to their territories, to establish\r\ntheir independent State with Holy Jerusalem as its\r\ncapital and to enable the Syrian Arab Republic to\r\nreinstate sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We are\r\nconvinced that without implementation of these\r\nresolutions, stability in this important region will never\r\nbe realized and will remain a mere dream. In this\r\ncontext, we commend the resistance and heroic\r\nstruggle of the people of Lebanon in the liberation of\r\ntheir territories.\r\nThe call to reform the international sanctions\r\nregime is gaining more momentum within the Security\r\nCouncil and other United Nations bodies, because the\r\nnegative effects of sanctions have compounded the\r\nsuffering of the peoples of the countries subjected to\r\nthem, in particular vulnerable groups such as children,\r\nwomen and the elderly. The most horrible and dreadful\r\naspects of the negative impacts of sanctions are seen\r\namong the Iraqi people. We add our voice to ongoing\r\nefforts to lift these sanctions.\r\nSudan also reaffirms the importance of\r\nmaintaining the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq,\r\nand rejects any measures taken outside the scope of\r\nUnited Nations resolutions and international\r\nlegitimacy. At the same time, Sudan reaffirms the need\r\nto respect and comply with all United Nations\r\nresolutions and to respect the sovereignty of Kuwait,\r\nand calls for a just and urgent solution to the issue of\r\nKuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners, through\r\ncooperation and understanding between the parties\r\nconcerned. We believe that it is high time to lift all\r\nsanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\r\nsince it has complied with and fulfilled all its\r\nobligations regarding the Lockerbie incident.\r\nWe view with satisfaction the recent positive\r\ndevelopments in the Horn of Africa, namely, the\r\nceasefire agreement reached between our two sisterly\r\nneighbours, Eritrea and Ethiopia. We hope this\r\nagreement will culminate in a lasting peace between\r\nthe two parties, and we should like to commend the\r\nefforts deployed by President Bouteflika of Algeria\r\ntowards that end.\r\nWe should also like to hail and commend the\r\nefforts of Djibouti and its President Ismail Omar\r\nGuelleh to achieve national reconciliation and restore\r\nstability to the Republic of Somalia. The Sudan,\r\nrepresented by President Omer Hassan Ahmed\r\nAl-Bashir, participated in the inauguration ceremony of\r\nAbdihassim Salad Hassan as President of the Republic\r\nof Somalia. We call on the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community to support efforts to restore\r\npeace, stability and security to Somalia under its\r\nelected leadership.\r\nWhile we fully understand the concerns of the\r\ninternational community about the ongoing conflict in\r\nthe southern Sudan, we should like to recall that the\r\nSudan is waging a war imposed by a rebel movement\r\nseeking to undermine its territorial integrity and the\r\nsafety and security of its people. We should also like to\r\nrecall that it was the Government of the Sudan that\r\ninitially invited the United Nations to undertake the\r\ntask of coordinating international humanitarian\r\nassistance for citizens affected by this conflict.\r\nTen years have elapsed since the implementation\r\nof the Agreement known as Operation Lifeline Sudan.\r\nHowever, it has had to be reviewed because of repeated\r\nviolations of its terms by the rebel movement and some\r\nother organizations participating in this process.\r\nIn this regard, it is my honour to express our deep\r\nappreciation and gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan and to his Special Envoy, Ambassador Tom\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nVraalsen, as well as to the personnel of the Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for\r\nthe understanding they have shown regarding the\r\nGovernment’s demands for ensuring impartiality and\r\ntransparency, as well as for determining the obligations\r\nof all parties to the agreement and ensuring the fair\r\nallocation of humanitarian assistance among citizens\r\naffected by the conflict on both sides. It is on the basis\r\nof this understanding that the Government has\r\ncommitted itself to ensure the safety and protection of\r\nall relief agency personnel operating in the southern\r\nSudan.\r\nWe believe it is our duty to brief the Assembly on\r\nthe current humanitarian situation in the Bahr el Ghazal\r\narea in the southern Sudan, where the rebel movement\r\nhas recently increased its violations of the partial\r\nceasefire. This has created obstacles and security\r\ncomplications that impeded the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian relief to affected citizens in that area. We\r\ntherefore urge the Assembly to bring pressure to bear\r\non the rebel movement to stop using civilian\r\npopulations and locations, such as hospitals and\r\nschools, as human shields and to fulfil its obligations\r\nby halting all military operations in order to ensure\r\nunhindered relief operations to all affected populations\r\nand to avert a humanitarian tragedy similar to the one\r\nendured by Bahr el Ghazal in the first quarter of 1998.\r\nThe Government of the Sudan has reaffirmed its\r\ncommitment to reach a just and lasting political\r\nsolution to the conflict in the southern Sudan based on\r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development\r\n(IGAD) initiative and to respond to other initiatives\r\nintended to solve other problems. Nonetheless, these\r\npeace efforts have not succeeded because of the\r\nintransigence of the rebel movement, which continues\r\nto renege on its obligations, undermining any\r\nagreement reached.\r\nThis is clearly reflected in the position of the\r\nrebel movement regarding the ceasefire, which it\r\ncontinues to violate, as well as its continued rejection\r\nof the call by the Government for a lasting,\r\ncomprehensive ceasefire — a call that has received\r\nwide support from the international community, the\r\nIGAD partners and several other United Nations\r\nagencies, as well as regional and international\r\ngroupings.\r\nPresident Omer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir\r\nreaffirmed in his address to the Millennium Summit the\r\ncommitment of the Government of the Sudan to a just\r\nand lasting political solution based on the following.\r\nFirst, there should be an immediate and comprehensive\r\nceasefire in order to facilitate the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the needy and to create a\r\nconducive atmosphere and confidence-building\r\nmeasures for the success of the peace efforts. Secondly,\r\nthere should be direct negotiations on the basis of\r\ncurrent peace initiatives, specifically, the IGAD\r\nprocess, which provides a negotiating forum for the\r\nGovernment and the rebel movement, as well as the\r\njoint Egyptian/Libyan initiative, which is aimed at\r\nachieving a comprehensive resolution to all of the\r\nSudan’s problems with the participation of the\r\nGovernment, the rebel movement and the opposition in\r\nand outside the Sudan. Thirdly, a comprehensive\r\npeaceful settlement should be reached in order to lay\r\nthe foundation for a fair distribution of power and\r\nwealth, establish rights and duties based on citizenship\r\nand guarantee total adherence to international standards\r\nand instruments of democracy and human rights.\r\nIn addition to efforts being deployed to solve the\r\nmilitary conflict in the southern Sudan, the\r\nGovernment continues to make efforts towards national\r\nreconciliation through direct and indirect contacts with\r\nopposition groups. Agreement has been reached to hold\r\na comprehensive national conference in which all\r\npolitical and social denominations and factions will\r\ntake part in order to discuss national unity, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and the system of government. The\r\nconference is expected to agree on a national charter\r\nthat will provide the basis for a system of government\r\ncharacterized by pluralism, freedoms and peaceful\r\ntransfer of power.\r\nThe Government has taken the initiative of\r\norganizing a preparatory meeting for this conference in\r\nKhartoum, and a national preparatory committee has\r\nbeen formed. This will be followed by another\r\npreparatory meeting to be held in Cairo to determine\r\nthe agenda, date and venue of the inclusive national\r\nconference. It is my pleasure to commend the efforts of\r\nthe Governments of Egypt and the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya in this regard.\r\nWhile efforts for peace and reconciliation are\r\nbeing pursued, the Government is undertaking the\r\nnecessary legal and administrative measures to\r\nestablish a democratic, pluralistic system that provides\r\nall the necessary freedoms. The Government is also\r\npreparing to hold parliamentary and presidential\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nelections, and has invited and welcomed the\r\nparticipation of international and regional\r\norganizations to supervise these elections.\r\nIn the economic field, the Government continues\r\nto implement programmes of reform and liberalization\r\nof the economy and is encouraging local and foreign\r\ninvestment. In this context, it is my pleasure to inform\r\nthe Assembly that the Executive Board of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund decided at its meeting last\r\nAugust in Washington to resume full cooperation with\r\nthe Sudan.\r\nThe Sudan has also managed to normalize its\r\nrelations with other international and regional financial\r\ninstitutions, and hopes that the flow of foreign aid and\r\nforeign direct investment to the Sudan will enable it to\r\novercome its economic difficulties and relieve its debt\r\nburden. We have also started preparations to draw up a\r\ndevelopment strategy for the coming decade, which\r\nwill concentrate on poverty alleviation and on\r\nproviding basic health services, education and rural\r\ndevelopment. Revenues from the export of petroleum\r\nwill be earmarked for socio-economic development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIt has now been two years since the United States\r\nmilitary aggression on the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical\r\nfactory in the Sudan, which resulted in the total\r\ndestruction of an important medical facility that used to\r\nproduce more than half of the Sudan’s needs for basic\r\nand life-saving medicines. The debris of that factory\r\nand the effects of the missile attack by the United\r\nStates still bear witness to what happens when the\r\nmilitary might of a super-Power is used irresponsibly.\r\nIt is ironic that the same super-Power that claims to be\r\na pioneer in protecting and safeguarding international\r\npeace and security and the principles of international\r\nlaw should resort to such an action. This gathering will\r\nrecall that immediately after that aggression, the Sudan\r\ncalled on the Security Council to send a fact-finding\r\nmission to verify United States allegations concerning\r\nthe factory and its financing. Yet despite the fact that\r\nthe whole world, and indeed several media\r\norganizations inside the United States, have cast doubts\r\non United States allegations about the Al-Shifa factory,\r\nthe United States Administration continues to maintain\r\nits position, contrary to all facts, thus insisting on\r\njustifying a wrong that has deprived the people of the\r\nSudan, especially the vulnerable and children, of a\r\nsource of medicine at affordable prices — less than\r\nhalf of what those medicines cost on the international\r\nmarket.\r\nConvinced that rights do not die, we shall\r\ncontinue our efforts to urge the international\r\ncommunity, the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly to send a mission to verify United States\r\nallegations, and we trust that our just cause has the\r\nsupport of all peace-loving countries that guard these\r\nnoble principles. We wish here to call on the United\r\nStates Administration not to use its position in the\r\nSecurity Council to block the sending of a fact-finding\r\nmission that will show the world the truth and expose\r\nthe unwarranted aggression against a basic health\r\nfacility.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes is a principal\r\nobjective and cardinal role of the United Nations. The\r\nSudan adheres to this objective and seeks to realize it\r\nin the conduct of its foreign relations at all levels.\r\nBased on this position, and in order to realize this\r\nnoble objective, the Sudan has continuously committed\r\nitself to respect for the norms of international law as\r\nthe only way to settle disputes and to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Sudan is today one of only 62 States that\r\nhave fully accepted the jurisdiction of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. Furthermore, the Sudan, during the\r\nMillennium Summit, signed the 1998 Rome Statute of\r\nthe International Criminal Court and deposited its\r\ninstrument of ratification for the 1997 International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.\r\nBy ratifying this treaty, the Sudan has become one of a\r\nfew countries that have completed the process of\r\nratification and adherence to all international\r\nconventions to combat international terrorism. This is\r\nindeed a source of pride to us. We believe the\r\nAssembly will agree that this record qualifies the\r\nSudan to make all possible contributions to maintaining\r\npeace and security through the highest specialized\r\ninstitutions.\r\nSince it became a Member of the United Nations\r\nfollowing its independence in 1956, the Sudan has\r\ncontinued to work in collaboration with the other\r\nMember States in order to develop and sustain\r\ninternational cooperation to realize the objectives of\r\nthe Charter in all fields. The Sudan looks forward to\r\npursuing this role in another important forum as a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod 2001-2002, for the first time in 28 years.\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nThe candidature of Sudan has been endorsed and\r\nsupported by the African continent, represented in the\r\nAfrican Group in New York, as well as by the Council\r\nof Ministers of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) at the OAU summit in Togo last July. The\r\nSudan looks forward with confidence and optimism to\r\nobtaining the support and endorsement of all United\r\nNations Members for its candidature in the elections\r\nthat will take place in the General Assembly in the\r\ncoming weeks.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Rodolphe Adada, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and la Francophonie\r\nof the Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Adada (Congo) (spoke in French): May I\r\nstart by joining previous speakers in offering, on behalf\r\nof the Congolese delegation, warm congratulations to\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri on his election to the presidency of\r\nthis Millennium General Assembly, as well as to the\r\nmembers of his Bureau. He can be sure that the\r\nCongolese delegation is ready and willing to help him\r\naccomplish his important and delicate task.\r\nI should also like to pay homage to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, for the\r\nskill and wisdom with which he carried out his\r\nmission.\r\nFinally, I should also like to commend Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his devotion and efficiency as\r\nhe leads our Organization.\r\nThe Millennium Summit, that great historic\r\ngathering, provided the leaders of the planet with an\r\nopportunity to debate at the highest level the burning\r\nissues of the dawn of the twenty-first century. The\r\nheads of State and Government examined the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the role of the United Nations\r\nin the twenty-first century, and this led to wise and\r\nrelevant decisions, which we should welcome. It is now\r\nup to us to do our utmost to ensure that the conclusions\r\nof that report will be translated into action.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations, the\r\nmanagement of globalization, the preservation of the\r\nenvironment, the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights, peacekeeping and international security are\r\namong the challenges facing humanity, today more\r\nthan ever before. The reform of the United Nations is\r\nof course essential. After more than half a century of\r\nexistence, our Organization must take account of the\r\nwill of all Member States to participate in the\r\nmanagement of the world’s affairs. The United Nations\r\nmust therefore undergo the transformations required in\r\norder to adapt to the requirements of the modern world.\r\nThis reform is in our opinion both necessary and\r\nurgent.\r\nWith regard to globalization, the question is no\r\nlonger whether one is in favour of or against this\r\nphenomenon. Globalization is a concrete reality that is\r\nhaving an impact on all areas of international relations.\r\nGlobalization is under way. However, if it is to produce\r\nall of its intended benefits, it is necessary to take into\r\naccount the interests of the developing countries. In\r\nthis regard, the question of development assistance,\r\ndebt and access to developed country markets must be\r\nenvisaged as conditions that will allow more fruitful\r\nand mutually beneficial cooperation between the North\r\nand South.\r\nWe are also very much concerned about the\r\nenvironment. Its preservation and protection have been\r\nat the centre of the concerns of the United Nations\r\nsince the world conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. It\r\nis of the utmost importance for our shared environment\r\nto be preserved and managed in conformity with the\r\nprinciples of sustainable development. All of us —\r\ndeveloped countries and developing countries,\r\nGovernments and private sector — all of us must agree\r\nto pay the price in a spirit of solidarity in order to\r\nremove any pretext for those who sometimes say they\r\nhave no other choice but to degrade the environment.\r\nWhat is at stake is the indispensable safeguarding of\r\nfauna, flora and, above all, the forests of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe Congo, an equatorial country, feels a special\r\nresponsibility in this area. Our Government has made a\r\nsolemn commitment to the sustainable management\r\nand use of our forests. This subject will in fact be the\r\nfocal point of a ministerial meeting of the African\r\nTimber Organization, which will take place in\r\nBrazzaville from 9 to 13 October next.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping and international\r\nsecurity, extensive efforts have been deployed by the\r\nUnited Nations to free humanity of the scourge of war.\r\nAnd although our successes may be remarkable, they\r\nare far from meeting the expectations of millions of\r\nmen, women and children around the world, who await\r\nwith anguish. That is why we strongly support the\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nproposals in the Brahimi Report and call for their rapid\r\nimplementation. In addition, we follow with interest\r\nand hope the negotiations between the State of Israel\r\nand the Palestinian Authority, and we greatly hope that\r\nthese efforts will be crowned with success.\r\nWe also welcome the most recent developments\r\nin the Korean Peninsula, all the more so because these\r\nexpress the will and deep aspiration of the Korean\r\npeople, separated by war, to live together in peace. We\r\nalso welcome the results achieved in Somalia, thanks to\r\nthe mediation of Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh, President of\r\nthe Republic of Djibouti. We welcome this true\r\nrenaissance in Somalia and we express our best wishes\r\nfor the return of a lasting peace in that fraternal\r\ncountry.\r\nIn Central Africa, determined to strengthen their\r\noperational peacekeeping capacities in the face of\r\npersistent crises and conflicts that are causing\r\ndeterioration in the region, the members of the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States have\r\ndecided to establish a council for peace and security\r\n(COPAX), whose operational organs will include the\r\nrapid reaction mechanism and the multinational\r\npeacekeeping force. Above and beyond its preventive\r\nmission, COPAX is also a response to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for reserve forces. It is important for the\r\ninternational community to contribute to the proper\r\nfunctioning of this sub-regional mechanism for\r\npreventive purposes and for managing and settling\r\nconflicts in this region of the world, which is the victim\r\nof murderous, devastating wars. We would like to take\r\nthis solemn occasion to express our desire to be fully\r\nassociated in the search for solutions to the problems of\r\nconcern to us.\r\nOur daily experience — one shared with\r\nothers — of the consequences of conflicts with\r\nneighbours fully justifies this concern; we want to\r\neliminate the sources of conflicts with our neighbours.\r\nThat is why, whenever it is necessary, the Congo does\r\nits utmost to dispel any misunderstandings and to\r\nstrengthen the links of brotherhood and cooperative\r\nrelationships with its neighbours.\r\nHere, I must draw the attention of the\r\ninternational community to the humanitarian drama\r\nthat is under way in the north-eastern part of our\r\ncountry as the result of the massive influx of refugees\r\nand displaced persons fleeing the renewed fighting in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, a country with\r\nwhich we share approximately 2,000 kilometres of\r\nborder. Given the seriousness of this situation, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Congo would like to\r\nrenew its call for robust assistance for the populations\r\nin distress, who have virtually been forgotten by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, my country, the\r\nRepublic of Congo, has also been shaken by internal\r\nconflict. I should like to assure the Assembly that we\r\nhave re-established peace after the signature of the\r\nceasefire agreements and the agreements to cease\r\nhostilities last year, thanks to the mediation of El Hadj\r\nOmar Bongo, President of the Republic of Gabon.\r\nOnce again, we should like to express our sincere\r\ngratitude to him.\r\nSince then, the Congo has turned its face towards\r\nthe future. The future for us means the consolidation of\r\nthis peace, national reconciliation, the rebuilding of our\r\ncountry and relaunching the process of\r\ndemocratization. That is why, starting in September of\r\nthis year, as proscribed by the President of the\r\nRepublic, Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, the Government\r\nof the Congo has undertaken a mission to carry out the\r\nbroadest possible consultations on a draft constitution\r\nto be submitted to our transitional Parliament in March\r\n2001. Its adoption will open the way to a constitutional\r\nreferendum and general elections.\r\nSimilarly, in the framework of the reconstruction\r\nof our country, we have just adopted an interim post-\r\nconflict programme for the period 2000-2002. Its\r\nimplementation requires the mobilization of significant\r\nfinancial resources, and the support of the international\r\ncommunity is indispensable for this purpose.\r\nWe can never reiterate enough that our\r\nOrganization has demonstrated its utility. Its reform,\r\nwhich is today unavoidable if we are to make it more\r\ncredible in a world which is undergoing constant\r\nchange and which will be changed profoundly by\r\nglobalization, is absolutely necessary. We must have\r\nvery strong political will to fight against poverty,\r\nignorance, illness, injustice and violence, as well as the\r\ndegradation and destruction of our planet. This is the\r\nonly way to guarantee the credibility of the United\r\nNations to the peoples of the United Nations.\r\nMay the commitments made at the Millennium\r\nSummit guide our daily actions, so that the role of the\r\nUnited Nations will indeed be strengthened over the\r\ncoming century for the well-being of all of humanity.\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nRoosevelt Douglas, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Dominica.\r\nMr. Roosevelt Douglas, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica, Mr. Roosevelt Douglas, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Douglas (Commonwealth of Dominica): I\r\nwish to extend my congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri\r\nand his country, Finland, on his election to the high\r\noffice of President of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. His experience and\r\nthe respect accorded him by the international\r\ncommunity will certainly ensure that the matters of this\r\nAssembly are conducted with efficiency and urgency.\r\nI should also like to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation for the very competent manner in which\r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, presided over\r\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe recently concluded Millennium Assembly\r\nwas exceptional for the number of world leaders who\r\nattended that historic event. The Declaration adopted at\r\nits conclusion sets forth laudable values and principles\r\nfor the guidance of the international community.\r\nFurther, it documents the goals that must be achieved\r\nand the challenges that must be met if we are to\r\nsucceed in creating a better world for all citizens of our\r\nglobal village.\r\nBut the Declaration is also a strikingly sad\r\nchronicle of the deplorable and degrading conditions\r\nthat affect the lives of most of the world’s population:\r\ndebilitating and abject poverty, economic deprivation,\r\noppression and injustice, inadequate or non-existent\r\nhealth care in the face of the HIV/AIDS epidemic,\r\nvictimization on the basis of ethnicity, children without\r\neducational opportunities but with daily experiences of\r\nhunger, lack of fresh and clean water and uncertain\r\nprospects of ever escaping depressing and unhealthy\r\nsurroundings.\r\nThese conditions were not newly discovered\r\nimmediately prior to the Millennium Assembly. Indeed,\r\nthey have been the subjects of United Nations\r\nresolutions at successive sessions of the General\r\nAssembly in the past. While there has been some\r\namelioration in some areas, largely through the efforts\r\nof the United Nations and its agencies, there has been\r\nnoticeable deterioration in others. The challenge that\r\nfaces the United Nations, and the international\r\ncommunity in particular, is to go beyond the concerns\r\nexpressed, the affirmations and resolutions and\r\ndemonstrate in tangible and effective ways a\r\ncommitment to serious engagement in a concerted\r\neffort to bring about meaningful change in the lives of\r\nthe many poor people among us.\r\nAs the Commonwealth of Dominica and other\r\nsmall States embark on the difficult road of raising the\r\nliving standards of their citizens, we find the task made\r\nmuch more difficult by the negative impact of the twin\r\nforces of liberalization and globalization. Globalization\r\nand trade liberalization operate to the advantage of the\r\nrich and developed countries, which have the requisite\r\ninstitutional and human resource capability and are\r\nwell placed to reap the benefits and rewards that accrue\r\nfrom these processes. For small countries like my own,\r\nwith very limited ability to carry out proper\r\nexploitation and to deal with current economic forces,\r\nglobalization has resulted in greater inequality and\r\nmarginalization and a widening gap between rich and\r\npoor nations.\r\nThat is the unavoidable result, since the\r\nproverbial levelling of the playing field is in reality\r\nnon-existent. And the countries benefiting from the\r\nprocess seem to have no interest in making sure that all\r\nnations, rich and poor, have an equal opportunity to be\r\nengaged in harnessing the opportunities presented by\r\neconomic and scientific innovations and by the\r\nrevolution in telecommunications and information\r\ntechnology.\r\nCompounding this problem is the disturbing and\r\nalarming tendency of the rich and powerful to fashion\r\ninternational trade rules and organizations with the\r\npurported intention of liberalizing trade but which in\r\nreality have resulted in creating a decisive edge in\r\ninternational commerce for themselves. Those who\r\nadvance the concept of free trade as the most efficient\r\nvehicle for income enhancement in developing\r\ncountries continue to cling to protectionist policies for\r\nselected items of trade while simultaneously engaged\r\nin a determined effort to deny market access that\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nprovides some small measure of special or differential\r\ntreatment for our exports.\r\nA clear case in point is the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) and what it represents for the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica and other small banana-\r\nproducing countries in the Caribbean and elsewhere.\r\nWe have traditionally, over a period of 50 years,\r\nexported our bananas to the European market, under\r\nspecial rules that made allowances for the particular\r\ncircumstances of small State size, or difficult terrain\r\nand high cost of production. In the interpretation and\r\napplication of its rules, the WTO is not minded to craft\r\ndecisions that promote equity and fairness among\r\nparties of unequal standing. But that is the logical\r\nexpectation for an organization that was evidently\r\nestablished to decide disputes among equals and on\r\nwhose dispute panels, particularly at the appellate\r\nlevels, the advanced countries are predominantly\r\nrepresented.\r\nThe ruling of the WTO in the dispute with respect\r\nto the European Union’s banana import regime has\r\nresulted in economic uncertainty in the Windward\r\nIslands, a situation made all the more damaging by the\r\ncontinuing inability of the parties to agree on a formula\r\nfor making the regime compatible with WTO rules. My\r\ncountry holds firmly to the view that adopting either of\r\nthe current proposals being considered to resolve the\r\nbanana dispute would result in economic stagnation\r\nand dislocation for the banana-exporting countries in\r\nthe Caribbean, particularly of course in the Eastern\r\nCaribbean, as well as Jamaica, Belize and Suriname.\r\nWe therefore urge the parties concerned to\r\nexplore a compromise solution that would allow\r\nDominica and other banana-producing countries to\r\ncontinue to export bananas to the European Union at\r\nprices that are fair and reasonable. Equal trade and fair\r\nprices are what we ask for, not handouts. Our suffering\r\nfarmers ask for no more. Meanwhile, our\r\ndiversification efforts are being accelerated while we\r\nstand square and firm in support of our farmers. My\r\ndelegation calls for a speedy resolution to this impasse,\r\nas we view the application by the United States of trade\r\nsanctions against some members of the European\r\nUnion as counterproductive and not conducive to\r\nreaching a fair and negotiated settlement. The\r\nthreatened carousel approach to imposing those\r\nsanctions is punitive and a pressure device, unfair to\r\nthose European countries.\r\nAt a time when there is a real prospect of our\r\nlosing our market in bananas and as we explore avenue\r\nof economic diversification, our fledgling financial\r\nservices sector has been subjected, since June last year,\r\nto a potentially serious attack from the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The\r\nOECD alleged that several Caribbean countries,\r\nincluding my own, are guilty of establishing and\r\nmaintaining tax havens. These countries were also\r\ncondemned for having competitive tax regimes and for\r\ntheir unwillingness to undertake to eliminate policies\r\nthat the OECD unilaterally determined to be harmful to\r\nits members. The Commonwealth of Dominica believes\r\nthat the unilateral formulations contained in the OECD\r\nreport are inconsistent with international practice and\r\nare designed to impede the development of the\r\ncompetitive capacity of the Caribbean jurisdictions in\r\nthe provision of offshore financial services. We believe\r\nthat international rules and practices must evolve from\r\ngenuine consultative practices and must be\r\ndemocratically applied on the basis of accepted\r\nprinciples and norms in the international community.\r\nWe take the view that the report is simply one more\r\nexample of small developing States being coerced into\r\ncomplying with rules, standards and practices\r\npromulgated by advanced States to advance the\r\nprotection of their economies while ours continue to\r\ndeteriorate.\r\nWe are committed to the establishment of\r\nadequate legislative and regulatory frameworks\r\nnecessary to insulate the sector from illegal activities.\r\nWe are also ready to work with the Financial Action\r\nTask Force to address any legitimate concerns they\r\nmay have. However, we do not intend to surrender our\r\nsovereign right to act in the best economic interests of\r\nour citizens, nor will we be deterred from doing so by\r\nthreats of any kind from any quarter.\r\nWhile our efforts at improving our export\r\nearnings are being undermined and our financial\r\nservices sector comes under serious scrutiny, the\r\ndevelopment programmes and strategies of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica continue to be affected by\r\nthe continuing decline in official development\r\nassistance (ODA). The expectation that foreign direct\r\ninvestment would bridge the gap has not materialized,\r\nnotwithstanding the strides we have made in providing\r\na climate of good governance, openness and stable,\r\ndemocratic practice, which, we were told, were the\r\nprerequisites for investment development.\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nThe simple truth is that the more advanced\r\ndeveloping countries have benefited disproportionately\r\nfrom the tremendous increase in foreign direct\r\ninvestment over the last decade, with the small and less\r\ndeveloped States receiving little or nothing at all. There\r\nmust be an understanding that if small developing\r\nStates are to embark successfully on the road to\r\nsustainable economic development without the benefit\r\nof foreign direct investment, official development\r\nassistance is indispensable to that process and the\r\ndeclining trend in the provision of official development\r\nassistance must perforce and necessarily be reversed.\r\nThe most deadly threat to our human resource\r\nbase and to our population at large is the contagion of\r\nHIV/AIDS. This disease takes a heavy toll not only in\r\nlives but also in social and economic terms, and the\r\ncountries most affected are the least able to deal with\r\nthe consequences. Statistics from the recent world\r\nconference on HIV/AIDS indicate that sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica has the highest rate of infection in the world,\r\nwith the Caribbean coming a close second.\r\nThis is not an African or Caribbean problem,\r\nhowever. Global in scope and impact, the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic warrants global attention and action. The\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica believes that as a first\r\nimmediate step there must come into being a\r\npartnership between the pharmaceutical manufacturers\r\nand the stakeholders in the international community,\r\nwith the express purpose of ensuring that less costly\r\nHIV/AIDS medication is readily available to those\r\nmost in need. Simultaneously, there must be increased\r\nefforts at raising awareness and consciousness of the\r\ncrisis and the preventive measures available, while a\r\ndedicated commitment to the development of an AIDS\r\nvaccine must be matched by increasing funding for\r\nresearch.\r\nIn 1994, the Commonwealth of Dominica\r\nparticipated in the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates and there reaffirmed our commitment to\r\nsustainable development programmes that enhance the\r\nquality of the lives of peoples, including their health,\r\nwell-being and safety.\r\nThe task ahead of us is to ensure that the\r\nmeasures and the resources of small island developing\r\nStates — the oceans, coastal environments,\r\nbiodiversity and human resources — are utilized in a\r\nsustainable manner that will be to the advantage of\r\npresent and future generations, as it is our\r\nresponsibility to preserve them. My country shares\r\nwith small island developing States the problem of the\r\nsafe disposal of solid and liquid waste. It has been\r\nrecognized that this lack of capacity results in marine\r\npollution and coastal degradation. Our position is\r\nconsistent with the Rio Declaration on Environment\r\nand Development that small island developing States\r\nwill be constrained in meeting the challenges that face\r\nthem if they do not have the cooperation and assistance\r\nof the international community.\r\nAs the United Nations meets for the first General\r\nAssembly of the new century, the delegation of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica wishes to address once\r\nagain the issue of democratic representation in the\r\nUnited Nations for the people of the Republic of China.\r\nIt is a concern to my delegation that the Republic of\r\nChina, with a democratically elected Government and a\r\npopulation of 23 million, is unable to participate in our\r\ndeliberations.\r\nThe Republic of China is a model of democracy\r\nin Asia and is more than able to carry out the\r\nobligations of our Charter. Over the past few decades,\r\nthe Republic of China has proved itself to be a good\r\nworld citizen, using its own economic development to\r\ngenerously assist in alleviating debilitating poverty\r\nthrough economic assistance programmes in many\r\nneedy developing countries. The situation of the\r\nRepublic of China should be addressed to ensure\r\nparticipation in the work and activities of our\r\norganization and its agencies as a valued member of\r\nthe international community.\r\nMy delegation calls for this fifty-fifth General\r\nAssembly to be a new beginning for the United\r\nNations. Rejuvenated by the unprecedented sharing of\r\nvision that we witnessed during the Millennium\r\nSummit, let us utilize those ideas, proposals,\r\nsuggestions and criticisms to chart a way forward for\r\nthe United Nations that will allow it to meet the needs\r\nand challenges of this new century.\r\nLet us look towards a new vision for a future that\r\nwill incorporate the weak and strong, the rich and poor\r\nand the developed and developing world, so that none\r\nwill be marginalized. Let us collaborate in achieving\r\nthe objectives of the Secretary-General’s millennium\r\nreport of freedom from fear and freedom from want.\r\nLet us include all Members — developed, developing\r\nand least developed — in the decision-making process\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.23\r\nso that all can share a future based on the premises laid\r\ndown by our forebears in the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I should like to thank\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Roosevelt Douglas, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Commonwealth\r\nof Dominica for his statement.\r\nMr. Roosevelt Douglas, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n"
