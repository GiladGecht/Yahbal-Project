(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdalla Saleh Al-Ashtal, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Yemen.\r\nMr. Al-Ashtal (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): Permit\r\nme, at the outset, to extend to you, Mr. President, my\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Let me\r\nalso pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, who guided the work of the previous session\r\nof the General Assembly most successfully.\r\nThis session acquires special importance, not\r\nonly because it is the first of the new millennium, but\r\nalso because it coincides with the convening of the\r\nMillennium Summit, which gathered together, for the\r\nfirst time, a majority of the world’s leaders. Therefore,\r\nthe historic instruments that emerged from the Summit\r\nwere a culmination of that momentous occasion.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, as President Ali\r\nAbdullah Saleh emphasized in his statement at the\r\nMillennium Summit, is committed to achieving those\r\nideals and objectives, supporting the leadership role of\r\nthe United Nations and promoting the purposes of its\r\nCharter, with a view to upholding the principles of\r\nfreedom, equality and justice, so that every society can\r\nassume its national responsibilities for comprehensive\r\nand sustainable development, including poverty\r\neradication, the provision of food, shelter, health care\r\nand education, ensuring fundamental freedoms, human\r\nrights and democracy and enabling women to play their\r\nrole in society.\r\nAccordingly, the Republic of Yemen supports\r\nefforts by the Secretary-General to develop the role,\r\nmechanisms and organs of the international\r\nOrganization to meet the challenges of twenty-first\r\ncentury. It also supports moves towards the renewal\r\nand development of inter-State relations and towards\r\nbringing them into line with new global phenomena\r\nthat call for democracy, respect for human rights and\r\nthe transformation of globalization into a positive force\r\nthat will benefit all inhabitants of the world. In this\r\nconnection, the Republic of Yemen reaffirms its\r\ninvitation to host the Fifth International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies, to be held in 2003.\r\nOur world has become a single village where\r\nevents interact globally with no room for isolationism.\r\nThe merging of States’ economies is the most\r\nprominent feature of mutual dependency and,\r\nconsequently, of shared responsibility aimed at creating\r\nan environment at the national and global levels\r\nconducive to development and poverty eradication.\r\nGood governance, as stated in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration, must exist not only within\r\neach country but at the international level and be based\r\non laws and transparency in financial, monetary and\r\ntrading systems.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nIn our view, this requires that the developed\r\nindustrialized countries fulfil their commitments to\r\nprovide official development assistance to developing\r\ncountries, address the special needs of the least\r\ndeveloped countries, provide debt relief to poor\r\ncountries and agree to cancel all official bilateral debts.\r\nWithin this context we would also include the removal\r\nof all barriers against the exports of developing\r\ncountries seeking access to world markets.\r\nThis year our people celebrated the tenth\r\nanniversary of the restoration of blessed Yemeni unity.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has been able to achieve\r\nsuccesses in the democratic process, freedom, justice,\r\nrespect for human rights and the enablement of women\r\nto play their role in society. While our people proceed\r\nto incorporate new concepts, with the aim of adapting\r\nto new world developments, they suffer from the\r\nfinancial burdens and the assumption of tasks inherent\r\nin comprehensive economic and social reform. In\r\naddition, the processes relating to economic\r\nliberalization — lifting subsidies on various foods and\r\nfuel and reducing public services, as prescribed by\r\ninternational financing institutions — have created\r\nsocial tensions. We therefore call upon the advanced\r\nindustrialized countries to understand this underlying\r\nreality of shared responsibility in the context of\r\ncomprehensive and sustainable development in the\r\ndeveloping countries as a guarantee for international\r\ndevelopment, security and stability.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has persevered in\r\nadvocating attainment of peace and stability at the\r\nregional and the international levels by the surest ways,\r\nnamely by resolving all disputes peacefully and\r\nthrough the use of mechanisms for the resolution of\r\ndisputes, which embodies faith in the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. We in\r\nthe Republic of Yemen are proud to have placed\r\npractical reliance on those principles in resolving\r\nborder issues with three neighbouring States: the\r\nSultanate of Oman, Eritrea and, recently, the Kingdom\r\nof Saudi Arabia.\r\nA new era of brotherhood, cooperation and\r\nmutual interests between the Republic of Yemen and\r\nthe fraternal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was inaugurated\r\non 12 June 2000, following the signature of a treaty\r\nbetween the two countries on international territorial\r\nand maritime boundaries. We deem it an historic\r\nachievement by all criteria, since it ends a long period\r\nof tension and instability. The frontiers between the\r\ncountries have become bridges of love, brotherhood\r\nand cooperation. This will, unquestionably, contribute\r\nto general stability in the region.\r\nWithin this framework one may understand\r\nYemen’s strong desire and long-term efforts to\r\ncontribute to a resolution of the problems that have\r\nplagued Somalia. Now that the Arta conference has\r\nbeen held, the Transitional National Assembly has been\r\nconstituted and the country’s President has been\r\nelected, we support the implementation of the\r\nresolutions that emerged from the conference. We hope\r\nthat the consensus between the representatives of the\r\nvarious Somali factions present at the conference will\r\nlead to stability and prepare the way for the\r\ncommencement of a process of comprehensive and\r\nsustainable development in an atmosphere of national\r\nreconciliation. In this regard, we must commend the\r\ngreat efforts made by President Ismail Omar Guelleh of\r\nthe Republic of Djibouti to ensure the success of the\r\nArta conference.\r\nThe return to normalcy in Somalia will\r\nunquestionably promote security and stability in the\r\nHorn of Africa, which has suffered the scourge of war\r\nand its effects. That suffering can be seen in the cross-\r\nborder flows of refugees. In the case of Yemen,\r\nhundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia and\r\nother States of the region have infiltrated the country\r\nvia our coasts. We appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to extend assistance to resolve the problem\r\nof refugees and ensure their return to their homelands\r\nfor the sake of stability and reconstruction in the\r\nregion.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen believes that the peace\r\nthat people seek is a peace based on justice, equality\r\nand respect for human rights. Accordingly, peace in the\r\nMiddle East should be based primarily on the\r\nrestoration of all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople. Foremost among those rights is the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State on\r\nPalestinian soil with Jerusalem as its capital. Israel\r\nmust also withdraw from all occupied Arab territories\r\nin the Syrian Golan.\r\nWe would also like to convey our esteem and\r\ncongratulations to fraternal Lebanon and its people on\r\nthe unconditional liberation of its southern part.\r\nThe world is still amassing large quantities of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Those weapons endanger\r\ninternational security and stability and hinder any steps\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\ntowards finding solutions to development problems. In\r\naccordance with relevant resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly, we in the Republic of Yemen stress the\r\nimportance of making the Middle East region an area\r\nfree from nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We also endorse the international\r\ncommunity’s call to exert pressure on Israel to adhere\r\nto the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to place all its\r\nnuclear installations under international supervision.\r\nIraq is experiencing a human tragedy as a result\r\nof the embargo that has been imposed on it for 10\r\nyears. While calling for the implementation of United\r\nNations resolutions concerning Iraq, we stress from\r\nthis rostrum the need to end that tragic situation by\r\nlifting the embargo. It has lasted too long and has\r\ncaused very extensive damage to the entire Iraqi\r\npopulation, especially women, children and elderly\r\npersons. In the same vein, we call for a complete lifting\r\nof the embargoes imposed on the Sudan and Libya.\r\nWith regard to the dispute over the three Arabian\r\nGulf islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates,\r\nYemen hopes that an amicable and peaceful solution to\r\nthat issue will be decided along the lines followed by\r\nthe Republic of Yemen in the resolution of its border\r\ndisputes with its neighbours.\r\nLastly, we welcome all the resolutions calling for\r\nthe reform of the United Nations and its structure so as\r\nto make it more transparent and democratic, including\r\nresolutions concerning the expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and enhancing and\r\nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIt is our hope that resolutions will be adopted at\r\nthis important session to contribute to the reform and\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations and its organs in\r\norder that it may meet the requirements of the new\r\ncentury, with its increasing problems and ever more\r\ncomplex inter-State relations.\r\nIt is our responsibility to make this session an\r\noccasion to review our work and to examine the\r\nresolutions adopted by our leaders at the Millennium\r\nSummit so that we can transform them into tangible\r\nreality. Doing so will further our progress towards\r\nachieving security, stability, development and\r\nprosperity for our countries and peoples. I am\r\nconfident that our united stance and sincere endeavours\r\nwill guarantee the success of this session and the\r\nachievement of the desired results.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Mongolia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Luvsangiin Erdenechuluun.\r\nMr. Erdenechuluun (Mongolia): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to join previous speakers in congratulating\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nMillennium Assembly of the United Nations. Allow me\r\nalso to express my confidence that under your skilful\r\nstewardship this session of the General Assembly will\r\nsuccessfully accomplish its mandate. I also wish to\r\ncommend our outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, for his eminent leadership during the previous\r\nsession of the Assembly.\r\nMy delegation extends its warm welcome to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Tuvalu, whose\r\nmembership has brought the United Nations yet\r\nanother step closer to universality.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is entrusted\r\nwith the honourable mission of following up on what\r\nwas agreed by the Millennium Summit of world\r\nleaders. For me personally, this session is also very\r\nspecial. For 26 years, or most of my diplomatic career,\r\nI have been associated with the United Nations. I feel\r\nparticularly privileged to deliver as Foreign Minister a\r\npolicy statement of my Government from this rostrum.\r\nA few days ago, Member States reaffirmed at the\r\nhighest level their commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, their\r\nunequivocal support for a more efficient and\r\nreinvigorated United Nations and their firm resolve to\r\ncollectively work towards a healthier and cleaner\r\nworld, free from fear and free from want. The\r\nMillennium Declaration underscored the collective\r\nresponsibility of world leaders to uphold the principles\r\nof human dignity, equality and equity at the global\r\nlevel.\r\nThat sense of solidarity and shared responsibility\r\nis, in our view, crucial for the international community\r\nto be able to address effectively the formidable\r\nchallenges at the dawn of the new millennium. The\r\nchallenges the world faces today are indeed manifold\r\nand complex, both in scope and nature. The central\r\nchallenge, as identified in the Secretary-General’s\r\nmillennium report, is how to make globalization more\r\ninclusive and have its benefits equitably enjoyed by all\r\nnations.\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nAs recently as the mid-1980s, the notion of\r\nglobality was virtually unknown in the international\r\nvocabulary, let alone the concepts of global governance\r\nor global climate change. Yet just a little more than a\r\ndecade later, not only does the idea of globality blend\r\nwith our day-to-day life, globalization per se has turned\r\ninto a powerful and inevitable process. Globalization\r\nhas been generously showered lately with both praise\r\nand criticism. Along with greater opportunities, it can\r\nalso lead to situations of heightened insecurity,\r\nespecially for the weak and poor nations. As my\r\nPresident, Natsagiyn Bagabandi, noted in his\r\nMillennium address,\r\n“Mongolia believes that, with its impartiality and\r\nuniversal legitimacy, as well as its Charter-based\r\nprevalence over any other international\r\nagreement, the United Nations is uniquely placed\r\nto provide an overarching general guidance to the\r\nprocess of globalization … so that it incorporates\r\nthe human dimension in its seemingly unruly\r\ntrends”. (A/55/PV.4)\r\nAs we draw lessons from the 1997-1998 Asian\r\nfinancial crisis, it has become more evident that the\r\nprocess of globalization ought to be managed so as to\r\nmake the best of its opportunities and diminish its\r\nnegative effects; and that internal policies, no matter\r\nhow righteous, are not sufficient to ensure sustained\r\neconomic growth in this era of growing\r\ninterdependence. This is even more true for\r\ndeveloping, structurally disadvantaged countries. In a\r\nglobally liberalized trade and financial system, these\r\ncountries need to be assisted to withstand powerful\r\nexternal forces, which so often are utterly destructive.\r\nAgain, this necessitates a genuine display of solidarity\r\nand shared responsibility on the part of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe global fight against abject poverty, inequality\r\nand disparity, violence, HIV/AIDS, organized crime\r\nand other acute problems is being impeded by, inter\r\nalia, the increasing external debt burden, the decline in\r\nofficial development assistance and the growing digital\r\nand development divides between haves and have-nots.\r\nThe affluent countries could exhibit their solidarity and\r\nshared responsibility by further opening their markets,\r\nproviding deeper and faster debt relief, and giving\r\nmore and better-focused development assistance and\r\nincentives for foreign direct investment flows to their\r\nless fortunate partners. In this context, Mongolia looks\r\nto the upcoming high-level international conference on\r\nfinancing for development, the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, and the\r\nnew multilateral trade negotiations to produce specific,\r\ntime-bound commitments.\r\nMongolia welcomes the South Summit\r\nDeclaration and the Havana Programme of Action as\r\nwell as the outcome of the meeting between the G-77\r\nand the G-8 in Okinawa as important junctures\r\nproviding an inspiring vision for more action-oriented\r\nSouth-South cooperation and a meaningful North-\r\nSouth partnership.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\ndecisions adopted at the tenth session of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), which underscored the necessity of\r\ncreating a legal environment that would facilitate\r\ntransit traffic for landlocked developing countries,\r\nimprove transit infrastructure and increase efficiency of\r\ntrade by eliminating transport and bureaucratic\r\nbottlenecks. Here, I am pleased to announce that a first\r\nspecific step to enhance and facilitate multilateral\r\ntransit transport cooperation is being taken in the\r\nNorth-East Asian region. As a result of a tripartite\r\nmeeting held in Ulan Bator under the auspices of\r\nUNCTAD earlier this year, Mongolia, Russia and\r\nChina have agreed to conclude a transit traffic\r\nframework agreement. Negotiations to draft such an\r\nagreement are under way.\r\nMy delegation further believes that the upcoming\r\nfifth meeting of governmental experts from landlocked\r\nand transit developing countries and representatives of\r\ndonor countries and financial development institutions,\r\nas well as a ministerial meeting on transit transport\r\nissues, expected to be held in 2003, will play a critical\r\nrole in strengthening a common framework of action to\r\nease the burden faced by landlocked developing\r\ncountries.\r\nWe support the proposals put forward in the\r\nmillennium report by the Secretary-General on\r\nimproving the provision of health services and\r\ncommunications in areas stricken by natural disasters.\r\nAs some might be aware, heavy snowstorms and the\r\nextremely cold winter of 1999-2000 in Mongolia\r\ncaused the loss of nearly 3 million heads of livestock,\r\nor about 10 per cent of the nation’s entire livestock\r\npopulation. Besides the direct loss of livestock, these\r\nheavy winter conditions, known as dzud, had other\r\ngravely devastating economic and social consequences,\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nincluding the loss of precious human lives. I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to express, on behalf of my\r\nGovernment and the people of Mongolia, our sincere\r\ngratitude to those Governments, international\r\norganizations and individuals that rendered timely\r\nassistance and support in our efforts to overcome the\r\nconsequences of dzud.\r\nAs world leaders solemnly reaffirmed in their\r\nMillennium Declaration,\r\n“the United Nations is the indispensable\r\ncommon house of the entire human family,\r\nthrough which we will seek to realize our\r\nuniversal aspirations for peace, cooperation and\r\ndevelopment.”(A/RES/55/2, para. 32)\r\nIf the United Nations is to adequately respond to\r\nthe challenges of today’s increasingly interdependent\r\nand rapidly changing world, a great deal will depend\r\non its ability to adapt itself to an environment that is\r\nmarkedly different from the one in which it was\r\nconceived by its founders 55 years ago.\r\nThe demands on the Organization have increased\r\nmany times over, especially in the area of\r\npeacekeeping. The lessons of Srebrenica, Rwanda and\r\nSierra Leone have made it abundantly clear that a\r\nthorough and critical review is needed to make\r\npeacekeeping operations succeed in meeting our\r\ncommitment under the Charter. We are deeply indebted\r\nto the United Nations Panel on Peace Operations,\r\nchaired by Ambassador Brahimi, which, in its report,\r\npresented a frank analysis of the prevailing situation\r\nand forthright recommendations for change. The report\r\ndeserves serious consideration and specific action at\r\nthis session of the General Assembly.\r\nMongolia stands committed to making a practical\r\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. As part of its efforts to adequately equip its\r\nmilitary officers and units for participation therein,\r\nMongolia took part for the first time in recent training\r\nexercises held in Kazakhstan for Central Asian\r\ncountries.\r\nEfforts to reform the Security Council have not\r\nyet brought us closer to resolving some of the\r\nfundamental issues on the agenda of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on that question. Like many others, we\r\ncontinue to believe that the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil should take place made in both categories,\r\npermanent and non-permanent. In the former category,\r\nalong with major industrialized Powers such as Japan\r\nand Germany, developing countries from Asia, Africa\r\nand Latin America that are able to contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security should\r\noccupy their rightful place in the Council. A reasonable\r\nincrease in the number of non-permanent seats would\r\nreflect the representative character of the Council and\r\nenable a growing number of Member States to\r\ncontribute to its work. An essential part of the reform\r\nprocess should deal with the veto power, the use of\r\nwhich should be considerably curtailed.\r\nMongolias vision of the future of the United\r\nNations has been elaborated in the memorandum of its\r\nGovernment on enhancing the role of the United\r\nNations in promoting the security interests of small\r\nStates, circulated in the United Nations as document\r\nA/55/310.\r\nNorth-East Asia is a region where the interests of\r\nthe big and powerful intersect, where the leftovers of\r\nthe cold-war era are still discernible, and where\r\nterritorial disputes await a positive solution.\r\nNonetheless, groundbreaking developments are taking\r\nplace which give rise to optimism and hope. I have in\r\nmind the historic inter-Korean summit, which has\r\nplayed a crucial role for building trust and confidence\r\nbetween the two countries. This and other recent\r\ndevelopments may well have a positive impact on the\r\nsituation in North-East Asia as a whole.\r\nDue to its historical and geopolitical realities,\r\nNorth-East Asia is probably the only subregion that\r\nlacks a mechanism at the governmental level where\r\nsecurity issues of concern can be discussed\r\ncollectively. Various ideas and proposals to this effect\r\nhave been floating around for some time, but no\r\nserious discussion of this issue has taken place so far at\r\nthe track one level. The time may have come to start\r\nthinking about the possibility of engaging in a\r\ndialogue, starting with a free exchange of views on the\r\nframework of these discussions.\r\nAs we review the progress made in the area of\r\narms limitation, disarmament and non-proliferation,\r\nour reaction can at best be termed as mixed. While\r\nthere has been some movement forward in certain\r\nareas, there has been little or no progress in others.\r\nThe 2000 Review Conference of the States\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) included in its Final\r\nDocument a number of agreed conclusions and\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nrecommendations related to nuclear disarmament. For\r\nthe first time ever, with reference to article VI, all the\r\nnuclear-weapon States made\r\n“an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the\r\ntotal elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading\r\nto total nuclear disarmament to which all States\r\nparties are committed under article VI”.\r\n(NPT/CONF.2000/28, part I, p. 14, para. 15 (6))\r\nThe Conference also agreed on the need to\r\nestablish in the Conference on Disarmament an\r\nappropriate subsidiary body with a mandate to deal\r\nwith nuclear disarmament. It called for the immediate\r\nestablishment of such a body. The Conference also\r\ncalled for further efforts by the nuclear-weapon States\r\nto reduce their nuclear arsenals unilaterally and for\r\nfurther reductions of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\r\nbased on unilateral initiatives as an integral part of the\r\nnuclear disarmament process. A call has been made for\r\nthe engagement, as soon as appropriate, of all the\r\nnuclear-weapon States in a process leading to the total\r\nelimination of their nuclear arsenal. These elements\r\nconstitute an important statement of purpose and, if\r\ntranslated into practice, will open the way to practical\r\nnuclear disarmament measures.\r\nMongolia welcomes the ratification by the\r\nRussian Federation of the Comprehensive Test Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT) and START II treaties, and we look\r\nforward to the United States’ ratification of the CTBT\r\nat an early date. We urge the Russian Federation and\r\nthe United States to follow up on their earlier\r\nannouncement regarding the discussions on the\r\nSTART III Treaty.\r\nMongolia joins the international appeal to the key\r\nStates to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban\r\nTreaty so that it could be brought into force as soon as\r\npossible. The urgency of this call becomes even more\r\ncompelling in light of the activities that could seriously\r\nundermine the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nMy delegation also believes that it is important\r\nfor the Conference on Disarmament, which for several\r\nyears has been unable to agree on a programme of\r\nwork, to end its stalemate and to engage in earnest\r\nnegotiations on an early conclusion of a universal and\r\nverifiable fissile materials cut-off treaty. Pending the\r\nnegotiation of that treaty, we would welcome a\r\nmoratorium by the nuclear-weapon-States on the\r\nproduction of weapons-grade fissile materials and for\r\ngreater transparency through disclosure of their present\r\nstocks. Better still, we would urge the United Nations\r\nto establish a register for all stocks of weapons-grade\r\nfissile material. This would help establish an important\r\nbalance with the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms.\r\nWe welcome the decision taken by the United\r\nStates to postpone the deployment of a national missile\r\ndefence system. The undermining of the Anti-Ballistic\r\nMissile (ABM) Treaty, a cornerstone of strategic\r\nstability, could trigger an uncontrollable nuclear arms\r\nrace.\r\nThe growing emphasis placed of late on nuclear\r\nweapons in military doctrines is a cause of increasing\r\nconcern. It is, therefore, only natural that countries like\r\nMongolia favour the adoption of such steps as de-\r\nalerting of nuclear weapons, removal of nuclear\r\nwarheads from delivery vehicles and joint undertakings\r\nby the nuclear-weapon powers of a pledge not to be the\r\nfirst to use nuclear weapons. These are essential safety\r\nmeasures that would reduce the risk of unauthorized or\r\nmiscalculated use of nuclear weapons. In addition,\r\nprovision should be made for legally binding negative\r\nsecurity assurances to non-nuclear States Parties to the\r\nNPT, as has become customary for nuclear-weapon\r\nStates in signing Protocols to nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone treaties. In this context, Mongolia welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to convene a major\r\ninternational conference aimed at identifying ways of\r\neliminating nuclear dangers. We hope that this timely\r\nproposal will be given serious consideration at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly, followed by the\r\nadoption of a relevant resolution to this effect.\r\nMongolia shares the legitimate concern of the\r\nworld community over the global proliferation of small\r\narms and light weapons, which are the principal\r\ninstruments of death wherever conflicts and wars\r\noccur. We hope that the United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nAll Its Aspects, scheduled for 2001, will result in\r\npractical measures designed to tighten control, curb the\r\nspread and destroy surplus weapons.\r\nAs is known, in 1992 Mongolia declared its\r\nterritory a nuclear-weapon-free zone; this was widely\r\nsupported by the international community. Since then\r\nwe have come a long way. At its fifty-third session the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 53/77 D entitled\r\n“Mongolia’s international security and nuclear-\r\nweapon-free status”. As a follow-up to its declaration,\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nthe Mongolian Parliament adopted a law last February\r\non Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status, thus\r\ninstitutionalizing it at the national level. At this\r\nsession, we expect a joint statement by the nuclear-\r\nweapon States to provide security assurances to\r\nMongolia in connection with its nuclear-weapon-free\r\nstatus, which would represent an important step along\r\nthe road to institutionalizing that status at the\r\ninternational level. I wish to put on record my\r\nGovernment’s appreciation to the five Permanent\r\nMembers for their constructive cooperation and\r\nsupport.\r\nWe believe that the aforementioned security\r\nassurances would be more credible if Mongolia’s other\r\nexternal security issues were duly addressed. In that\r\ncase, not only would the status be more credible; but it\r\nwould also allow Mongolia to serve as a positive factor\r\nof stability and predictability in the region. In this\r\nconnection, we certainly share the view of the\r\nSecretary-General, expressed in his report on this item,\r\nthat consultations with the relevant United Nations\r\nbodies will produce concrete and action-oriented\r\napproaches to addressing the non-nuclear aspects of\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn line with the broader approach to security, and\r\non the basis of relevant provisions of the\r\naforementioned resolution, the International\r\nConference on Human Security in a Globalized World,\r\nin the context of Mongolia, was held this year with the\r\nparticipation of the United Nations and international\r\nexperts; it produced detailed recommendations on a\r\nwide range of human security-related areas. In many\r\nrespects, the recommendations of our Conference\r\nparallel the spirit and concepts of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nIn July of this year parliamentary elections were\r\nheld in Mongolia, the fourth elections since the onset\r\nof democratic reforms a decade ago. The elections\r\nwere recognized as free and fair by all political forces,\r\nas well as by international observers, and served as a\r\ntestimony of further consolidation of democratic norms\r\nand institutions in my country. They proved once again\r\nthat the embrace of democracy and respect for human\r\nrights are an irreversible choice made by the\r\nMongolian people. As a result of the elections, the\r\nMongolian People’s Revolutionary Party won an\r\noverwhelming majority of seats in the Parliament.\r\nFrom this high rostrum, I wish to reiterate my\r\nGovernment’s robust commitment to the consolidation\r\nof democracy and the continuity of reforms. The task\r\nof ensuring human security and promoting human-\r\ncentred development is high on the agenda of the new\r\nGovernment, as envisaged in its action programme.\r\nThe Government is resolved to ensure sustained\r\neconomic growth through reinvigorating and\r\nencouraging the development of domestic industry,\r\nupgrading the living standards of the people by\r\nreducing poverty and unemployment and ensuring\r\nequitable social and educational opportunities.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia will intensify the\r\nstructural reforms and encourage an export-oriented,\r\nprivate sector-led economy. Mining, the processing of\r\nraw materials of animal origin, tourism and other\r\nexport-oriented sectors are the priority areas of\r\ndevelopment. The privatization of State assets,\r\nincluding the most valued State enterprises, will\r\ncontinue. The creation of a favourable environment for\r\nthe attraction of foreign investment is also a priority\r\nobjective.\r\nI fully share the view expressed in the\r\nMillennium Report that success depends to a\r\nconsiderable degree on the quality of governance the\r\ncountry enjoys. Hence, my Government attaches\r\nparticular importance to enhancing the effectiveness,\r\ntransparency and accountability of public offices and\r\nfighting corruption in both corporate and public areas.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia is determined to\r\ncooperate closely with non-governmental organizations\r\nand other representatives of civil society in enhancing\r\nthe rule of law throughout the country.\r\nIn its endeavours to carry out simultaneous\r\neconomic and political reforms, Mongolia is\r\nencountering a multitude of challenges. The eighth\r\nmeeting of the Mongolia Assistance Group will be held\r\nlater this year in Paris, and my Government is\r\nconfident that our foreign partners will continue to\r\nextend their generous support and cooperation so as to\r\nease the transition challenges faced by my country.\r\nIn pursuing its foreign policy, based on the\r\ncontinuity of a multi-pillar, open and proactive\r\napproach, Mongolia will continue to develop and\r\nexpand its friendly relations with the Russian\r\nFederation and the People’s Republic of China on the\r\nprinciples of good-neighbourliness, mutual benefit and\r\nequality. My Government will accord high importance\r\nto the further development of bilateral relations with\r\nthe industrialized nations, including the United States\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nof America, Japan, other Asian and Pacific countries\r\nand members of the European Union. Their political,\r\nmoral and financial support will continue to play an\r\nimportant role in facilitating our reform efforts. The\r\nMongolian Government will actively strive to\r\nstrengthen our traditional long-standing relations with\r\nEastern and Central European countries, as well as with\r\nthe developing countries of Asia and the Pacific, Latin\r\nAmerica and Africa.\r\nMongolia will continue its active participation in\r\nmultilateral processes and international organizations,\r\nsuch as the United Nations, and will spare no effort to\r\nensure that the world Organization remains a focal\r\npoint for the coordination of the efforts of the\r\ncommunity of nations towards peace and development\r\nin the years to come.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Souef Mohamed El-Amine, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Comoros.\r\nMr. El-Amine (Comoros) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros,\r\nI congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession. I assure you of our full support and\r\ncooperation in the accomplishment of your tasks. Your\r\nskill and extensive experience in international affairs\r\nconvince us that this session will be crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\nI am honoured to take this opportunity to extend\r\nour profound appreciation to your predecessor, Mr.\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNamibia, for his outstanding management of our affairs\r\nduring the previous session, for his leadership role in\r\nthe General Assembly and for his spirit of effective\r\ncooperation.\r\nWe also thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\r\nhis tireless efforts in the service of our Organization.\r\nHis wise approach to the important issues and the\r\nreforms he is implementing in the United Nations\r\ndeserve our support and cooperation at all levels.\r\nOn behalf of the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros, I also congratulate Tuvalu on its admission\r\nto membership of the United Nations.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nConsidering the enormous responsibilities of the\r\nUnited Nations in peacekeeping, the defence of human\r\nrights and the promotion of social well-being, it is easy\r\nto see why, 55 years after its creation, the Organization\r\nstill has a great deal to do. Given its varied activities, it\r\nneeds more solid and up-to-date structures that are\r\nadapted to contemporary conditions; sufficient and\r\nreliable funding; sound, transparent and energetic\r\nmanagement; and the ability to carry out its tasks in\r\nconformity with current priorities and specific regional\r\nconcerns. The Millennium Summit further reaffirmed\r\nour Organization’s essential role in this respect.\r\nThat is why the United Nations new\r\norganizational plan must allow it to respond to the\r\nneeds of today’s world in the face of major upheavals\r\nthat inspire intense introspection and consideration. Its\r\nreform is also necessary to guarantee sound and\r\nreliable structures, with equitably distributed duties,\r\nthat will confirm its universal nature and ensure better\r\nresults. Thus, it is particularly necessary to open the\r\nSecurity Council, the organ primarily responsible for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, to\r\nother countries, as permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers, in order to make it more representative and\r\nto ensure that its membership and working methods\r\nreflect present-day realities.\r\nAt a time when the world is evolving and\r\nundergoing globalization, the island States and small,\r\npoor countries with limited resources are preoccupied\r\nby the threat of marginalization looming over them. In\r\naddition to the various crises besetting our countries,\r\nthis state of affairs calls on us to address the urgent\r\nneed for support, assistance and, especially, awareness\r\nof the dangers we are facing.\r\nFirst are the dangers arising from the immediate\r\nand long-term repercussions of the conflicts engulfing\r\nthe planet, claiming millions of victims, most of them\r\nchildren, women and the elderly.\r\nSecondly, there are the dangers posed to the\r\nworld by the ever-growing number of acts of terrorism.\r\nIn this respect, it is important not only to be aware of\r\nthe potential danger and to find effective means of\r\ncountering it, but also to draw clear distinctions\r\nbetween and not to confuse the behaviour of people\r\nwho act in contempt of law and human dignity with\r\nthat of those who act primarily out of religious\r\nconsiderations.\r\nThirdly, there are the dangers resulting from\r\nflagrant violations of human rights. To combat this\r\nproblem, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\ngives its full support to the implementation of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, which should put an end\r\nto these abuses. The Republic is preparing to ratify the\r\nStatute soon, and it hopes that the implementation of\r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction will be effective.\r\nFourthly, there are the dangers resulting from\r\nnatural catastrophes and from the overall degradation\r\nof the environment — the increasing vulnerability of\r\nwhich is a source of serious concern for the world. The\r\nsmall land-locked States — developing countries of\r\nlimited size — are particularly exposed to these\r\ndangers. Given the increasing severity of this problem,\r\nthere is an increasingly urgent need to give priority to\r\nprotecting ecological systems.\r\nFifthly, there are the dangers posed by serious\r\ndiseases from which our populations are suffering —\r\ndiseases such as AIDS, malaria and many others,\r\nextreme poverty included.\r\nSixthly, there are the dangers posed by the\r\nmarginalization of the poor countries in the midst of a\r\nworld undergoing rapid change, a world in which it is\r\nhard for these countries to find their way.\r\nSeventhly and finally, there are the dangers to\r\nwhich these same countries are exposed as a result of\r\nthe external debt burden which absorbs a great deal of\r\ntheir attention and wreaks havoc on their national\r\nbudgets.\r\nThis is to say that in this first stage of our entry\r\ninto the third millennium, there are many outstanding\r\nquestions regarding the future of humanity, and these\r\nquestions require careful consideration. The overall\r\nimage presented by the world today is a sombre one.\r\nAlso, as regards economic issues, it goes without\r\nsaying that the world is facing a situation that calls for\r\nserious examination and for joint action by the\r\ndevelopment partners to support national, subregional\r\nand regional efforts.\r\nIn the case of Africa, its overall economic\r\nproblems are a source of concern because they have\r\nbecome aggravated as a result of the increasingly\r\nglobalizing world and the great strain that external debt\r\nis placing on our economies. Further, it makes sense to\r\nbe concerned about the future of a continent that has\r\nbeen marginalized, in particular as regards global trade\r\nand the information revolution, and afflicted by all\r\nkinds of plagues. It is essential that — in addition to\r\nthe efforts of the individual countries and in the\r\nframework of regional integration — the continent\r\nbenefit from the good offices of the international\r\nfinancial institutions in examining and addressing\r\ndifferent problem areas. In this regard, I am pleased to\r\nhere reiterate our appreciation for the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme to fight,\r\nalongside our Governments, all forms of\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nAs a small landlocked developing country and as\r\nan African country, the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros is grappling with these kinds of problems. It\r\ncannot be denied that, despite our current situation, our\r\nGovernment is manifesting a firm will in searching for\r\nways and means of lifting the country out of the hole in\r\nwhich it finds itself and of creating favourable\r\nconditions for improving the life of our society. The\r\neffort under way to clean up the public finances and to\r\nrevive and restructure the national economy attest to\r\nthe Comorian Government’s determination to improve\r\nthe socio-economic situation that has prevailed for\r\nmany years in the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros.\r\nOur bilateral and multilateral partners have\r\nconsistently supported these efforts; however, I need to\r\nreiterate the necessity of enhancing this assistance in\r\norder to help us meet the challenge of\r\nunderdevelopment and, above all, to help us avoid\r\nfalling victim to the perverse effects of globalization.\r\nWe should also focus on the political situation of\r\nthe world, which is today divided by various sorts of\r\nwars and crises, which are seriously upsetting the\r\npeace and security of peoples. Greater attention should\r\nbe given to these two crucial objectives — objectives\r\nthat form the very basis of our Organization — and\r\ngreater thought should be given to how to vouchsafe\r\nthem.\r\nThis is why, on the subject of wars, I would like\r\nto appeal to the goodwill of the parties involved in the\r\nproblem of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nin the entire Great Lakes region and to ask them to\r\nfocus their efforts on démarches that can produce\r\nnegotiated solutions to the disputes of these parties.\r\nAs regards Somalia, my country is greatly\r\npleased by the current happy outcome of the situation\r\nthere and by the establishment of a transition\r\nGovernment. The Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros hopes that the solid foundations have now\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nbeen established so that a lasting peace can be secured\r\nfor this fraternal country.\r\nIn the same vein, the Comorian Government\r\nappreciates the efforts made in the holding of the Camp\r\nDavid negotiations and salutes the work of the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America in this\r\nregard. The Comorian Government, which has\r\nsupported and continues to support the Palestinian\r\ncause, hopes that these efforts will lead to a speedy\r\nresolution of the Middle East crisis — a resolution that\r\nwill be in the interest of the peoples of that region who\r\nhave so long suffered from incessant instability. The\r\nComorian Government also believes that any solution\r\nto this crisis must include the establishment of an\r\nindependent Palestinian State, with Al-Quds al-Sharif\r\nas its capital.\r\nFurther, we proclaim the necessity of completely\r\nlifting the embargo against Libya, and also ask that the\r\nembargo against Iraq be lifted. We appeal to the Iraqi\r\nGovernment to cooperate more fully with the efforts to\r\nfree the Kuwaiti prisoners.\r\nConflict zones remain in all the continents. The\r\nCharter of the United Nations having been written for\r\nthe peoples, the United Nations must enhance its\r\nefforts to prevent and resolve conflicts by peaceful\r\nmeans. In essence this means insisting on the urgent\r\nnecessity of supporting the cause of world peace,\r\nbecause its absence handicaps all efforts to achieve real\r\nsustainable human development.\r\nIn this regard, allow me to review the current\r\nsituation in my country, the Islamic Federal Republic\r\nof the Comoros, and to explain how disturbed the\r\npeople are about the threat to peace posed by the\r\nseparatist crisis that has been taking place on the\r\nsisterly island of Anjouan for close to three years. With\r\nthe support of the international community — in\r\nparticular, the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nthe League of Arab States, the European Union, and\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie, and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference — the Islamic\r\nFederal Republic of the Comoros has explored every\r\nmeans of putting an end to this crisis. The\r\nintransigence of the Anjouanese party after the\r\ndeclarations that were made during the inter-island\r\nconferences that were held at Addis Ababa and at\r\nAntananarivo have led the OAU to take repressive\r\nmeasures against this party — measures that were to be\r\napplied in a step-by-step fashion.\r\nThe object of imposing the economic embargo\r\nagainst the sisterly island of Anjouan was to lead the\r\nAnjouanese to be reasonable. However, the situation\r\nhas hardly changed, and during this time the lowest\r\nlevels of Anjouanese society — along with all those\r\nwho were supporting national unity — suffered terribly\r\nfrom the effects of these measures. Recognizing on the\r\none hand that, given the hardening of the movement’s\r\nposition, this situation was victimizing the population\r\nof Anjouan, and particularly the poorest levels, and\r\nconvinced on the other hand that we Comorians\r\ntogether might be able to come up with a non-military\r\nsolution, the current leadership of the country, under\r\nthe enlightened direction of Colonel Azali Assoumani,\r\nPresident of the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros, has insisted on undertaking direct\r\ndiscussions with the Anjouanese party, in the hopes of\r\narriving at national reconciliation.\r\nThe attempts at initiating such a dialogue opened\r\nthe way to the signing of an initial text on 1 July 1999\r\nat Fomboni on the island of Mwali. This text is\r\nconsidered to represent a significant step on the part of\r\nthe current regime — a step towards harmonizing the\r\nopposing points of view.\r\nThe negotiations were continued recently, leading\r\nto the signing of a joint declaration, again in Fomboni\r\non 26 August. This provides another appropriate\r\nframework for preserving the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of the Comoros, to which the Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs of The Gambia referred on 20\r\nSeptember. Because it allows dialogue to be initiated\r\nwith our Anjouan brothers on the future Comorian\r\nentity, the declaration is of particular significance to\r\nComorians.\r\nThe Fomboni declaration makes it clear that the\r\nnew Commorian entity is the sole subject of\r\ninternational law within the Comorian frontiers\r\nrecognized by the international community. In order to\r\npush ahead with this process, a timetable was\r\nestablished spelling out the various stages leading to\r\nthe submission to a referendum of the act which is to\r\ngovern the future Comorian entity.\r\nI should like to make it clear that the Fomboni\r\njoint declaration takes account of, and respects, the\r\nspirit of the Antananarivo Agreement, which was\r\nrejected by the Anjouan party.\r\nToday, more than ever, there is hope that it will\r\nbe possible to resolve this unfortunate problem by\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\npeaceful means and to lay the groundwork for a\r\ndemocratic State — a Comorian-style democracy, a\r\ndemocracy stemming from the living forces of the\r\nnation of the Comoros, without any outside\r\ninterference or influence. Would it have been just to\r\nreject this breakthrough, thus penalizing innocent\r\nwomen and children who have been so sorely tried by\r\nthe embargo, and then to envisage a military solution?\r\nIf there had been resort to war in order to have peace,\r\nwhy not avoid it, if possible, and so prevent casualties?\r\nThe Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros has\r\ncommitted itself to dialogue to settle conflicts,\r\nrespecting the principles of our Organization.\r\nThis wise principle was the basis of the Comorian\r\nauthorities’ approach to their brothers in Anjouan. I\r\ntherefore appeal for understanding by all our partners\r\nwho have always supported our efforts to find a\r\nnegotiated lasting solution to this crisis. This is why,\r\nwhile respecting the position of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and that of all our other partners,\r\nI reiterate, on behalf of the Government of the\r\nComoros, our determination to continue this struggle,\r\ntogether with them, in order to preserve the unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of our country.\r\nThe Government of the Comoros pays tribute to\r\nthe Secretary-General of the OAU, Mr. Salim Ahmed\r\nSalim, for his personal efforts and his efforts through\r\nthe OAU to resolve this crisis. We also express our\r\nwholehearted gratitude to the League of Arab States, as\r\nwell as the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie, the\r\ncountries of the region and other friendly countries,\r\nincluding France, for their support.\r\nWe earnestly hope that reason has finally\r\nprevailed with our brothers in Anjouan and that they\r\nhave really understood that breaking up the covenant of\r\nunity and fraternity which links us and will always link\r\nus — Comorians of the four islands of our archipelago\r\nState — will not benefit anyone.\r\nWe hope that we have all learned the lessons from\r\nevents which have so seriously affected the country in\r\nhuman, material, psychological and other terms, and\r\nthat we understand that war will always be a bad\r\nmaster and the worst choice. The process of\r\nreconciliation is a demanding task requiring a great\r\ndeal of resources. In this connection, we make a\r\npressing appeal to the international community to\r\nsupport the programme of reconstruction and national\r\nreconciliation which the Comorian Government has\r\ndrawn up in conjunction with the World Bank.\r\nFaithful to the fundamental principles of the\r\nCharter, the Government of the Comoros continues to\r\nopt for the policy of dialogue and discussion to resolve\r\nall of the problems which confront us. With profound\r\nrespect for these principles, we appeal to France, with\r\nwhich the Comoros has for long had close ties of\r\nfriendship and cooperation, to contemplate a direct and\r\nconstructive dialogue which will make it possible\r\nquickly to reach a negotiated solution with regard to\r\nreintegrating the Comorian island of Mayotte into its\r\nnatural community.\r\nAs stability, understanding, unity, harmony\r\namong our peoples, partnership and progress go hand\r\nin hand, creating conditions to guarantee these values\r\nwould be the best gift which the international\r\ncommunity can offer present and future generations on\r\nthe eve of the next millennium.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\n“If people one day want life\r\nFate has no choice but to respond;\r\nNight has no choice but to yield to dawn\r\nAnd shackles cannot but be shattered.”\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Irakli Menagarishvili, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Georgia.\r\nMr. Menagarishvili (Georgia): At the outset,\r\nallow me to extend my warmest congratulations to you,\r\nSir, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. It is without doubt a\r\nfitting recognition of your rich personal experience as\r\nwell as Finland’s role in world affairs.\r\nThe Millennium Summit has made it clear that, in\r\nthe words of the Secretary-General,\r\n“the United Nations remains as much in demand\r\nas in need of change.” (Global Governance 4\r\n(1998), p. 123)\r\nThis is a formidable challenge, but also an opportunity,\r\nand the cost of not rising to the new calls of the next\r\nmillennium can be dangerous.\r\nI cannot but recall that many ideas on\r\nglobalization and governance generated and debated at\r\nthe current session echo the concept of “management\r\nof interdependencies”, put forward by our President,\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nMr. Eduard Shevardnadze, at the forty-seventh session\r\nin 1992. With this in mind, let me address some of\r\nthose important issues from our standpoint.\r\nThe end of totalitarian regimes set in motion a\r\nwhole host of progressive changes within and among\r\ncountries. However, we are still struggling with the\r\nadverse legacies of totalitarianism. The experience of\r\nthe post-cold-war era clearly demonstrates that intra-\r\nState conflicts have become a major threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report to the Millennium Summit called for\r\nreshaping of the United Nations approach to\r\npeacekeeping to meet the challenges of this new global\r\nthreat. This very idea is particularly topical for the\r\nregion I represent. As my colleague, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Germany, said: “the triangle between\r\nCentral Asia, the Caucasus and the Middle East” being\r\n“full of destabilizing factors … is threatening to\r\nbecome the crisis region of the century ahead.”\r\n(A/55/PV.14) Therefore, this region merits closer\r\nattention by the international community.\r\nIn this context, I also endorse the appeal by the\r\nAustrian Foreign Minister, in her capacity as\r\nChairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), for enhanced\r\npolitical awareness by the world community of these\r\nunresolved or potential conflicts and security risks,\r\nwhich she said\r\n“are often outside the spotlight of broader public\r\nattention, but nevertheless have a highly\r\ndestabilizing impact on the region and\r\nbeyond.”(A/55/PV.17)\r\nPeriodic failures of United Nations peace efforts,\r\nmanifested, for instance, in the “ethnic cleansing” of\r\nthe predominantly Georgian population during the\r\ntragic developments in Abkhazia, Georgia, highlighted\r\nall the flaws of selective peacekeeping. Well-\r\nintentioned United Nations efforts have sometimes\r\nbeen delayed and ineffective in conflicts which the\r\nworld community regards as peripheral. I believe that\r\nwe should make every effort to prevent conflicts\r\nbecoming “frozen”.\r\nConsequently, we support the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal aimed at implementing necessary changes to\r\nincrease the effectiveness of United Nations peace\r\nefforts in general. I cannot help but call for the more\r\nfrequent and firm application of the United Nations\r\npeace-enforcement mechanisms envisioned in Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter, in particular those for coping with\r\nprotracted conflicts.\r\nThe Charter calls for the consent of the parties\r\ninvolved when launching peacekeeping operations or\r\nrenewing their mandate. However, peacekeeping\r\npractices often play into the hands of separatists trying\r\nto maintain the status quo. We believe that the United\r\nNations should intensify its efforts to balance the\r\ninterests of all sides with the dynamics of the peace\r\nprocess and the comprehensive resolution of conflicts.\r\nMoreover, we welcome the further enhancement of the\r\nUnited Nations standby arrangement system and the\r\nimprovement of the Organization’s rapid-deployment\r\ncapabilities.\r\nGeorgia also expresses its agreement with the\r\nUnited States initiative to reconsider the scale of\r\nassessments and the reallocation of the cost of United\r\nNations peacekeeping. In the context of increasing the\r\neffectiveness of United Nations peace operations, this\r\ninitiative is of great significance.\r\nIn addition, complex conflicts, such as that in\r\nAbkhazia, Georgia, which has left hundreds of\r\nthousands of internally displaced persons deprived of\r\nthe right to return to their permanent places of\r\nresidence, must be addressed within a multifaceted\r\nframework, which entails social and economic\r\napproaches, along with political ones.\r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for the\r\ninvaluable assistance it provides to the refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons in Georgia. I also express\r\nour special appreciation for the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme assistance programmes in\r\nGeorgia, particularly those aimed at improving the\r\nliving conditions of the internally displaced persons\r\nand increasing their self-reliance.\r\nI am stressing the issue of peacekeeping as it is\r\ndirectly related to the most sensitive problem for my\r\ncountry in the past seven years, since it fell victim to\r\naggressive separatism in Abkhazia, Georgia. I reiterate\r\nthat a peaceful resolution of this conflict is the only\r\nacceptable option for the Georgian Government. In this\r\nrespect, I extend our gratitude to the United Nations\r\nand to the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General\r\nfor their efforts in support of the peace process. But we\r\nshould also admit that so far we have failed to achieve\r\nany tangible results here.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nRecently, within the United Nations framework\r\nand in accordance with the relevant Security Council\r\nresolution, a document on the distribution of\r\nconstitutional competences between Tbilisi and\r\nSokhumi has been drafted. We support this initiative\r\nand find it difficult to understand what stands in the\r\nway of its timely endorsement. We are convinced that\r\nsubmission of the document for consideration by the\r\nSecurity Council should not be delayed; its\r\nendorsement by the Security Council as a basis for\r\npolitical negotiations will create a sound ground for\r\nadvancing the peace process in Abkhazia, Georgia.\r\nFurthermore, I reiterate that about 300,000\r\npredominantly Georgian refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons from that conflict zone are still being\r\nsubjected to the continuous violation of their rights and\r\ndifficult living conditions. The return of the internally\r\ndisplaced persons to their rightful places of residence is\r\ncontinuously hampered by the Abkhaz side, with\r\nblatant disregard for internationally recognized norms,\r\nas well as for a number of Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe strongly believe that there is an urgent need for the\r\nSecurity Council to address those issues in a timely\r\nmanner.\r\nIt has become apparent that at times the United\r\nNations is not capable of handling conflicts on its own.\r\nI strongly believe that the key to more effective United\r\nNations peace policies in our region lies in closer\r\ncollaboration and synchronized action with such\r\nregional organizations as the OSCE and other European\r\nstructures. Regrettably, the reality remains different.\r\nHaving established that “ethnic cleansing” was\r\ntaking place in Abkhazia, Georgia, the OSCE called for\r\nthe dispatch of a fact-finding mission to push forward\r\nthe peace process. However, the United Nations\r\nremains reluctant to accept the OSCE findings. While it\r\nis struggling with a variety of approaches, the “ethnic\r\ncleansing” of the Georgian population in Abkhazia\r\ncontinues. There is therefore a great need to ensure\r\nconcerted action by the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations in the process of conflict management\r\nand resolution.\r\nThe dilemma of humanitarian intervention could\r\nbe described as being inherent to the transition from an\r\ninternational to a global — and, hence, more human-\r\ncentred — world. It has put in a new light the\r\ncorrelation between human rights and security. We are\r\nstrong proponents of a value-based, universal global\r\norder. Therefore, we are confident that the international\r\ncommunity should focus on establishing within this\r\nOrganization strong and efficient preventive\r\nmechanisms, mechanisms to prevent gross and\r\nsystematic violations of human rights, in order to\r\nreduce the likelihood of “humanitarian intervention”,\r\nan extreme measure. We believe that the International\r\nCriminal Court will play an indispensable role in this\r\nrespect as a deterrent and as a preventive mechanism.\r\nThe dilemma of “humanitarian intervention” is also\r\ndirectly related to United Nations reform, in regard to\r\nadapting the existing decision-making mechanism to\r\nthe timely and effective use of force.\r\nI believe that the primary purpose of the United\r\nNations as a guarantor of international peace cannot be\r\nsustained without also securing democracy on the\r\nglobal level. To set the developing world on the path to\r\nprosperity, United Nations activities should encompass\r\npurposeful financial, economic and political measures\r\naimed at encouraging the democratic development of\r\nthe newly independent States, which would secure\r\ngood governance, the rule of law, the protection of\r\nhuman rights and predictable administration. Secure\r\ndemocratic development, not merely security of\r\ndemocracies, is the main challenge to be addressed in\r\nthe course of shaping the global world.\r\nWith regard to our region, in the context of\r\nsupport to the new and restored democracies, we\r\nconsider the initiative of Azerbaijan, Georgia,\r\nMoldova, Ukraine and Uzbekistan to establish an open\r\ngrouping, known as GUUAM, to be of particular\r\nimportance. Additional impetus to the manifold\r\ncooperation within the grouping was given by the\r\nmeeting of the heads of the GUUAM States during the\r\nMillennium Summit here in New York.\r\nSometimes in newly established democracies a\r\nprotracted process towards material welfare calls\r\ndemocratic values into question. One of the most\r\nburdensome problems in this respect is debt\r\naccommodation. I am confident that it is imperative to\r\nrelease poor and developing countries from this\r\nconstraint. Writing off the debts will generate a\r\nstronger impetus, and create the opportunity for these\r\nStates to firmly remain on the chosen course of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nWe also believe that the all-encompassing process\r\nof globalization urgently calls for a dialogue of\r\ncivilizations as a means of addressing the challenges of\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nthe new millennium, as reaffirmed by the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) round table that preceded the\r\nMillennium Summit. I confirm Georgia’s readiness,\r\nexpressed by President Eduard Shevardnadze, to play\r\nan active role in facilitating such a dialogue.\r\nMuch has changed in the 55-year history of the\r\nOrganization, and today the world community is faced\r\nwith a new type of challenge requiring novel\r\napproaches. In the past decade, there have been\r\nrepeated calls for Security Council expansion. We\r\nsupport the principle of expanding both permanent and\r\nnon-permanent membership in the Council by\r\ndeveloped as well as developing countries to ensure\r\nadequate regional representation. We believe that the\r\nseat of a non-permanent member should be allocated\r\nfor the Group of Eastern European States, the number\r\nof which has considerably increased. We are firm\r\nsupporters of permanent membership for Germany and\r\nJapan and hope this issue will find its resolution before\r\nlong.\r\nGeorgia welcomes the increased transparency in\r\nthe Security Council deliberations. We think that each\r\nMember State should be permitted to participate in the\r\ninformal meetings of the Council, when the issues\r\ndiscussed are of concern to them.\r\nTime and again United Nations actions have been\r\nineffective due to protracted decision-making and lack\r\nof consensus in the Security Council. Therefore, the\r\nreform of the Security Council should encompass its\r\ndecision-making procedure, including the veto rights as\r\nwell.\r\nFinally, I would reiterate that the challenges of\r\nthe next millennium are myriad and complex. And it is\r\ncrystal-clear that only united can we address the\r\ndifficulties of the future and overcome the dividing\r\nbarriers in shaping a new, global world order. I wish to\r\nall of us success in this endeavour.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Hugo Tolentino Dipp, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Tolentino Dipp (Dominican Republic)(spoke\r\nin Spanish): Representing and speaking on behalf of\r\nthe Government of the Dominican Republic, which\r\nsince 16 August 2000 has been presided over by\r\nMr. Hipólito Mejía on the basis of the votes cast by our\r\npeople for the Dominican Revolutionary Party, we\r\nshould like to reaffirm our profound commitment to the\r\nprinciples that gave life to this Organization and to the\r\nprospect for its further work as we head into a new\r\nmillennium.\r\nWe should like to voice our congratulations to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his having\r\nconvened the historic Millennium Summit on the basis\r\nof the report about the role to be played by the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century, a document which\r\ncontained an intelligent and pinpointed analysis of the\r\nmost acute problems of the present and of what is\r\nahead for the international community.\r\nThe Dominican Republic is convinced that\r\nfreedom and equality for all States and for all human\r\nbeings, without any distinctions whatsoever, constitute\r\nthe underpinnings for real peace and for harmonious\r\nand democratic development of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe assessment of the world situation drawn up at\r\nthe Millennium Summit highlighted that\r\nnotwithstanding the extraordinary scientific and\r\ntechnological strides made, the development in\r\ncommunications media and the rapid expansion of the\r\nwealth of some countries, two thirds of mankind live in\r\nconditions which prevent freedom and equality from\r\nbeing a common denominator for all the peoples of the\r\nearth.\r\nIt is all too well known that globalization is not\r\nemerging as some magic formula or a panacea to heal\r\nwounds, nor as any wondrous invention of the genius\r\nof certain sectors of the rich countries.\r\nMr. Simão (Mozambique), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nGlobalization is the continuation of a process\r\ngoing back centuries in the history of humankind and\r\nsomething which, unfortunately, on the one hand does\r\ncontribute to the progress and enrichment of some, but\r\non the other hand still leaves us with a developed and\r\nan underdeveloped world. It is precisely because of its\r\nunequal effects upon the peoples of the world that at\r\nthe South Summit of the Group of 77 held in Havana,\r\nand at the Millennium Summit which took place in this\r\nvery Hall, we heard with renewed strength a just call\r\nfor freedom and equality.\r\nThe breadth and the dizzying speed of the\r\nchanges which globalization has triggered in recent\r\nyears have stirred the good conscience of humanity,\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nand, although it appears a paradox, a peaceful\r\nrebellion, albeit a distrustful one, is beginning to\r\nprotest what is seen in all this as just one more form of\r\nthe traditional domination of the powerful over the\r\nweakest.\r\nWe peoples that had been colonized, and, having\r\ngained independence, had to live in permanent defence\r\nof our sovereignty and our cultural identity, have\r\ndeveloped the kind of sensitivity that allows us to sort\r\nout the real consequences of certain historic processes.\r\nThat explains how, faced with the effects of\r\ninescapable globalization, we have reacted critically,\r\ndetermined not to continue to live on the sidelines and\r\nnot to accept that we should withdraw, unable to\r\nachieve the security of a future filled with hope\r\nthrough the exercise of our free will.\r\nGlobalization must be guided by the conviction\r\nthat the aspiration of a world free from upheaval can be\r\nachieved only by an equitable interdependence which\r\ncan understand that the current imbalances caused by\r\nthe requirements and conditions imposed by certain\r\nbodies can be met by the underdeveloped countries\r\nonly by the gradual application of free trade\r\nagreements and the elimination of the kind of\r\nprotectionism that stands in the way of the free access\r\nof goods and services to the markets of the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nOne single example shall suffice to illustrate the\r\nconsequences of the indiscriminate opening of the\r\nmarket of an underdeveloped country. In the\r\nDominican Republic thousands and thousands of\r\nmedium and small-sized companies have gone\r\nbankrupt because they could not compete with the\r\navalanche of products from the highly industrialized\r\ncountries.\r\nPeoples whose asymmetry in relation to the\r\ndeveloped countries has been affirmed over centuries\r\ncannot and will not be able to adapt to being\r\nparticipants benefiting from globalization if they do not\r\nreceive the kind of support that allows them to attain\r\neconomic and social objectives that can contribute to\r\novercoming their current underdevelopment. To talk\r\nabout globalization and to leave the poor countries to\r\ntheir own devices to make all the efforts necessary to\r\ncome up to the speed of the wealthy countries is a cruel\r\njoke. Globalization must be imbued with an effective\r\nspirit of solidarity and social justice. Otherwise,\r\nunderdeveloped humankind may find itself faced with\r\na new version of the economic voracity that is\r\nillustrated in the fable of the shark and the sardine.\r\nWe believe that these concerns are all too\r\nlegitimate and, first and foremost, foresighted. We\r\nmust not in the future be forced to find a new word for\r\nglobalization to brand it as we branded the imperial\r\npolicies of the past.\r\nGlobalization is already doing more than give rise\r\nto concerns and exacerbate the problems of the poor\r\ncountries; it also steadily worsens the external debt\r\nsituation. How many times must we pay that debt?\r\nWhen will we finish paying it? We are convinced that\r\ncertain aspects of globalization and the consequences\r\nof external debt are two sides of the same coin. The\r\nindifference to the harm that this ruinous debt burden\r\ndoes to the economies of poor countries makes one\r\ndoubt the existence of a true spirit of solidarity or a\r\nsincere readiness to cooperate. Only forgiving that debt\r\nunder logical and favourable conditions and through\r\nmechanisms guaranteeing effectiveness can give\r\nunderdeveloped countries the encouragement they need\r\nto embark on the path into the new era.\r\nMoreover, current price of oil is a further source\r\nof distress for those who depend on it for energy\r\nproduction. This year’s oil bill for the Dominican\r\nRepublic will be more than $500 million, which\r\naccounts for some 15 per cent of our national budget.\r\nThis situation — one shared by many other peoples —\r\ndemands consideration founded on international\r\nsolidarity and cooperation.\r\nWhen we in the Dominican Republic speak of\r\nsolidarity and cooperation, we cannot but speak of\r\nHaiti. Because we are adjacent to that fraternal people,\r\nwe know how much it needs the generous, sustained\r\nsupport of the international community. As the\r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, Mr. Hipólito\r\nMejía, said at the Millennium Summit, the Dominican\r\nRepublic cannot alone bear the present social burden of\r\nhundreds of thousands of Haitian citizens. The\r\nDominican Republic therefore wants a solution in\r\nwhich the international community would be an active\r\nparticipant, one that must be based on human rights\r\nand that must be implemented in accordance with the\r\nnorms and principles that must govern a sound\r\nmigration policy.\r\nBut let no one think that we have come here to\r\ngrumble and to use the General Assembly as a wailing\r\nwall. That is by no means true. The Government of the\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nDominican Republic is absolutely convinced that it is\r\nDominican society itself that must make the greatest\r\neffort to achieve development. Mindful of its\r\nresponsibilities, therefore, the Government of the\r\nDominican Republic accepts the challenge of\r\nglobalization, because it knows that the first thing is to\r\naddress the priorities of development, and because it\r\nknows also that its greatest efforts must go towards\r\nestablishing social justice to resolve problems of\r\neducation, health, the environment, the equality of men\r\nand women, children, eliminating poverty, ending drug\r\ntrafficking, nutrition and steady improvement in human\r\nrights and civil liberties.\r\nFortunately for many of the world’s peoples,\r\ndeveloped countries and international bodies largely\r\nunderstand that the point of globalization must not be\r\nto unleash market forces and to bring about\r\nprotectionism, production subsidies and technical\r\nregulation, because such obstacles can only contribute\r\nto widening the gulf between rich and poor. Those\r\ncountries and organizations are working together\r\nsincerely to ensure that the benefits of this process will\r\nbe shared through cooperation involving the\r\ncomprehensive development of peoples. It was in that\r\nspirit and with those concerns in mind that the United\r\nNations proposed the 2001 High-level\r\nIntergovernmental Event on Financing for\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe Dominican Republic has strengthened its ties\r\nwith the Caribbean, with Central America and with\r\nother areas of integration, and we are making our\r\ncontribution to enhance the possibilities for\r\nnegotiations, access to foreign markets, technology\r\nexchanges and cultural enrichment. Moreover, we\r\nbelieve that South-South cooperation is an\r\nindispensable complement to growth-oriented\r\nprogrammes undertaken with developing countries.\r\nI turn now to the need to reform the Charter of\r\nthe Organization. Much has happened since 1945. With\r\nundeniable skill, the United Nations bodies of that time\r\ndealt with the tasks they faced in the wake of the\r\nSecond World War. But that was then; now, those\r\nbodies do not reflect the realities of a new international\r\ncommunity that is larger and more demanding of\r\ndemocratic development.\r\nReform of the Security Council is imperative; the\r\nDominican Republic considers that it must take place\r\nin keeping with the sovereign equality of States,\r\nequitable geographical distribution and the varying\r\nlevels of development of peoples. We are convinced\r\nthat an increase in the number of both permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members, carried out on the basis of\r\nthose principles, would enable the General Assembly to\r\nplay its role as the organ that is truly representative of\r\ninternational democracy.\r\nI turn now the establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court, which was a major event. We hope that\r\nthe Court will be able to mete out justice not only to\r\nheads of State, heads of Government and officials who\r\ncommit war crimes, crimes against humanity or crimes\r\nagainst citizens, but also to those who engage in\r\nadministrative corruption and theft of State property,\r\nsomething that certainly constitutes a crime in many\r\ncountries because of the economic and moral harm it\r\ncauses to their peoples.\r\nBecause of the desire of the Dominican Republic\r\nto be consistent with the historic tradition of its\r\ninternational relations, it wishes to reaffirm its support\r\nfor the Republic of China in its logical and just\r\naspiration to rejoin the Organization, of which it was a\r\nprominent Member for many years. Here, our position\r\nreflects a duty born of conscience, not a position that\r\nwould diminish the rights that the United Nations has\r\nrecognized others to have.\r\nAlso linked to our historic tradition is the\r\nprinciple of national sovereignty. Since it won\r\nindependence on 27 February 1844, the Dominican\r\nRepublic has held the right of self-determination as an\r\nunshakeable article of faith. Thus, when there is talk of\r\nalso enshrining humanitarian intervention as a right, we\r\nfind ourselves faced with a situation that demands\r\nclear-cut and precise definitions. We request this body\r\nto devote to this issue the attention it deserves so that\r\nall its Members will participate in clearing up such a\r\nworrisome matter.\r\nMr. Simão (Mozambique), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nFinally, the Dominican Republic wishes to\r\nexpress its conviction that the dialogue initiated by the\r\nMillennium Summit and the positions expressed in the\r\nGeneral Assembly will contribute positively to\r\nstrengthening efforts for peace and brotherhood, which\r\nare the essence of the spirit of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Her Excellency\r\nMs. Paulina García de Larrea, Vice-Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Ecuador.\r\nMs. García de Larrea (Ecuador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the outset, I wish to convey to the\r\nPresident my congratulations on his election to lead\r\nthis session of the General Assembly. He represents a\r\ncountry that shares with mine the ideals and principles\r\nthat favour peace, culture, human rights, solidarity and\r\nunderstanding.\r\nI hail the entrance of Tuvalu into our\r\nOrganization, and I congratulate the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on\r\nthe skilful and intelligent manner in which the\r\nimportant work of the last session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe political events that occurred in the world in\r\nthe last decade speeded up changes on the international\r\nscene, ushering in new global structures and processes.\r\nThe disappearance of the ideological underpinnings of\r\nthe cold war produced profound transformations that\r\nchanged the geopolitical foundations that had prevailed\r\nin the twentieth century.\r\nThe consolidation of large economic blocs and\r\nthe technological revolution have had a palpable\r\nimpact on the pace of economic and social change\r\nthroughout the world. The free market and the new\r\ntechnologies have favoured competition and have\r\ngenerated the transnational expansion of banking and\r\nfinance, which has fundamentally changed the way the\r\nworld economy works.\r\nIn this global context, countries are joining the\r\ntrends of globalization from very different levels of\r\ndevelopment, and consequently, the opportunities and\r\nthe effects of these new processes turn out to be\r\nextremely unequal. Technological, financial and\r\nproductive disparities have deepened between the\r\ndeveloping countries and the industrialized nations,\r\nwhere most of this potential is concentrated.\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts of countries to adapt to and\r\nbecome integrated into a new international\r\nenvironment, inequities have grown and social\r\nproblems have mushroomed in an environment of\r\ndeteriorating international cooperation.\r\nThe Millennium Summit, which opened this\r\nsession of the General Assembly, proved to be a\r\nhistoric opportunity to consider in depth the challenges\r\ninherent in the new global trends, which are generating\r\na new international order, with its risks and its\r\npotential for peace and security, economic growth,\r\nsustainable development and human security. It has\r\nbecome clear in the light of these realities that no\r\ncountry can remain on the sidelines or be insulated\r\nfrom the major global changes, and that all States must\r\nface the great challenge of working together to regulate\r\nthe new processes within a universal endeavour to\r\nchannel the process of development to secure the\r\nbenefits of globalization, while meeting the needs of\r\nthe peoples.\r\nWithin this context of international responsibility\r\nas a priority, the United Nations has a dominant role to\r\nplay, as a universal forum for States to work together\r\nfor ideals and objectives common to all peoples and to\r\nstimulate international cooperation for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication.\r\nIn the new century, the Organization’s potential in\r\nworld affairs must be fully used. Ecuador trusts in an\r\neffective multilateral system whereby global norms for\r\nthe era of globalization are created in a democratic,\r\nparticipatory and systematic manner. With that\r\nobjective, the Summit acknowledged the representative\r\nnature of the United Nations in the fulfilment of its\r\nessential goals, within the framework of the new global\r\nprocesses and the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe interdependence of international political and\r\neconomic problems becomes significant in this great\r\ntask, creating a complex mix of matters to be\r\nconsidered on the international agenda of this global\r\ninstitution, the United Nations, which, because of its\r\nlegitimacy, has the responsibility for adopting\r\ncoordinated policies and implementing guidelines that\r\nensure the efficiency and timeliness of this\r\nOrganization’s response to events and phenomena\r\noccurring in the world that directly affect international\r\nsecurity and stability.\r\nI wish to reiterate my congratulations to the\r\nSecretary-General on his valuable contribution to the\r\nwork of this Millennium Assembly through the\r\npresentation of his analytical report on the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century. His thoughts\r\nare extremely useful in considering the role and the\r\nchallenges of the United Nations in the years ahead.\r\nI must also highlight the contribution of the Latin\r\nAmerican countries to the work of the Millennium\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nAssembly through the adoption of the Cartagena\r\nDeclaration by the heads of State or Government of the\r\nRio Group, and the contribution of the South Summit\r\nand the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, groups\r\nof which Ecuador is a member.\r\nEcuador shares the view regarding the advantages\r\nand opportunities relating to the United Nations\r\ninfluencing the management of international public\r\naffairs and cultivating the commitment of all actors to\r\napproach the new global processes and structures from\r\nthe perspective of human development.\r\nGlobalization and poverty must be tackled with\r\nthe priority that their profound consequences for\r\nhuman development require. The trends of\r\nglobalization today appear merely as an economic\r\nprocess, dehumanized and lacking in social\r\ndimensions. This process concerns itself with free\r\ntrade, competition and new information technologies,\r\nwithout an approach that guarantees that it works for\r\npeople and that opportunities for progress and the\r\nbenefits of the process will be distributed worldwide,\r\nto all countries.\r\nEcuador is experiencing one of the most acute\r\ncrises of its history. Its effects have had a grave impact\r\non State institutions and have led to instability in the\r\nprocess of consolidating democracy. Domestic and\r\nforeign factors combined in recent years have\r\ncontributed to aggravating the crisis through\r\nmacroeconomic imbalances that have severely battered\r\nthe economy and people of Ecuador. In this context of\r\nenormous difficulties, the conditions Ecuador had\r\nnegotiated for its foreign debt became extremely\r\ndifficult to meet. Those factors, together with the\r\nadjustment measures taken to confront the crisis, have\r\nhad a considerable impact on poverty.\r\nThis global forum must be aware of the enormous\r\ndifficulties imposed on highly indebted poor countries\r\nboth by disproportionate external debt servicing and by\r\nthe continuing obstacles to their export products, as\r\nwell as by the fluctuations in the international financial\r\nsystem that work against national efforts to create\r\nconditions of economic stability and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. In meeting its goal of bringing about a\r\njust and equitable international order, the General\r\nAssembly should find means to reduce the external\r\ndebt of developing countries, including heavily\r\nindebted medium-income countries affected by natural\r\ndisasters.\r\nEcuador has made great efforts to find a just and\r\nlasting solution to the problem of the excessive burden\r\nof foreign debt. Last August it took a first step in\r\nrenegotiating the Brady debt segment, and it concluded\r\nits negotiations with the Paris Club last week. We trust\r\nthat understanding and above all fairness will mark the\r\ncontinuation of this process so that a definitive solution\r\nmay be found for the problem of external debt, which\r\nis crushing developing countries and hindering the\r\nimplementation of priority social programmes in the\r\nareas of health, education and employment. The\r\nrestraining effect of debt is undoubtedly one of the\r\nmain obstacles in the fight to reduce poverty and attain\r\nthe goals set in this area by 2015.\r\nIt is necessary to have an economic and\r\ninstitutional order that provides outlets to countries\r\nwith small economies, which are the most vulnerable\r\nand likely to be affected by extreme crises.\r\nEcuador, committed to overall national\r\ndevelopment, resolutely supports United Nations\r\nactivities implementing financial and technical\r\ncooperation in support of countries’ national efforts to\r\npromote sustainable development in order to bring\r\nabout a better future for all peoples. The United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) plays a role\r\nin that task as the main operational tool for the efforts\r\nof the Organization in support of national plans and\r\npriorities to alleviate poverty, contribute to democratic\r\ngovernance and strengthen national capacities for the\r\nbenefit of human development. I appeal to the\r\ninternational community to ensure that the Millennium\r\nAssembly gives resolute political backing to UNDP as\r\nthe central instrument for the overall management of\r\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century, and to ensure\r\nthat the Programme has the financial strength necessary\r\nto fully enable it to carry out its operational activities.\r\nThe situation of international trade also deserves\r\nour priority attention, as it has a direct influence on the\r\neconomic and social activities of nations. We call for\r\nthe elimination of trade barriers and obstacles, and\r\ndemand the application of norms that will make it\r\npossible to carry out trade in an open, predictable and\r\nequitable way. In accordance with our long-standing\r\ntradition of integration, we support the strengthening of\r\nthe Andean Community and its increased international\r\noutreach, in particular with regard to its relations with\r\nthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR),\r\nthe European Union, Russia and the Pacific Basin and\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nin the context of negotiations to create a free trade area\r\nof the Americas.\r\nEcuador shares the international community’s\r\nconcern over the continued degradation of natural\r\nresources, the threats to the environment and the\r\ninadequate compliance with the commitments made at\r\nthe 1992 Earth Summit on sustainable development.\r\nGiven its economic, social and environmental\r\nimplications, we should insist on the need to give\r\npriority to sustainable development as a cross-cutting\r\nfactor in international relations, with regard both to\r\npolicies and cooperation. There is an imperative need\r\nto incorporate appropriate environmental technologies\r\nand to develop sustainable production patterns in order\r\nto strengthen national scientific and technological\r\ncapabilities. The Government of Ecuador has\r\nincorporated the concept of sustainable development\r\ninto its national legislation, promoted the adoption of\r\npolicies and action plans in that context and\r\nstrengthened its own environmental authority.\r\nThe phenomenon of drug trafficking, with its\r\nglobal effects, is another matter for the international\r\ncommunity, as it respects neither borders nor nations\r\nand poses widespread dangers to society. Drug\r\ntrafficking has developed a supranational system in\r\nwhich no particular nation can be viewed as the root\r\ncause of the problem. It is essential that we recognize\r\nthe principle of shared responsibility in coping with the\r\nreality of this phenomenon, and that we take the\r\nnecessary international steps to resolve it. Abiding by\r\nthis universal commitment, which has already been\r\nrecognized in the 1988 Convention against Illegal\r\nTraffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances,\r\nis fundamental in our fight against this global problem,\r\none of the challenges confronting humankind.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, peace,\r\nsecurity and disarmament constitute other priority\r\nchallenges that the United Nations will continue to\r\nface. Ecuador advocates the peaceful resolution of\r\ninternational disputes and condemns the threat and use\r\nof force in relations between States, as we are\r\nconvinced that a system of peace and trust among\r\nnations must be based on the peaceful resolution of\r\ndisputes and on specific disarmament measures in the\r\ncontext of the purposes and principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and the norms of international law.\r\nIn its pursuit of the goals of peace and security,\r\nthe Security Council bears primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance and restoration of international peace.\r\nEcuador deems it a priority, in terms of the renewal of\r\nthe United Nations, to reform the Council’s\r\ncomposition and methods of work. The Council’s\r\nmission makes it vital that we correct the current\r\nimbalances in the Council’s composition, improve its\r\ndecision-making machinery and lend greater\r\ntransparency to its methods of work.\r\nAnother challenge for the United Nations\r\nconcerns the role and the strengthening of\r\npeacekeeping operations. In recent years humankind\r\nhas witnessed the exacerbation of regional conflicts\r\nand the negative consequences of war in various parts\r\nof the globe. It is vital that joint action in the\r\nframework of this world Organization be strengthened,\r\nso that the use of force, when absolutely necessary, can\r\nbe applied in strict conformity with Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter. In this way the United Nations will be able to\r\nretain the international credibility it requires as the\r\nlegitimate forum for, and agent of, collective action to\r\npromote international peace and security.\r\nOne of the pillars of democracy in any society is\r\nstrict respect for human rights, the defence and\r\nprotection of which are the responsibility not only of\r\neach and every State but also of the international\r\ncommunity. The international community, therefore,\r\ncan no longer remain silent or indifferent; it must react,\r\nin a legitimate manner, to the massive violations of the\r\nrights of entire peoples that were perpetrated in the\r\nfinal years of the past century, which are a source of\r\nshame for humankind. Furthermore, it is totally\r\nunacceptable for one or more States to seek to\r\nrepresent the international community and to apply,\r\nunilaterally and by force, a non-existent “right to\r\ninterference” on the basis of humanitarian\r\nconsiderations.\r\nIn 1998 Ecuador promulgated a national human\r\nrights plan with a broad and democratic perspective.\r\nThe plan, which takes an integrated approach to the\r\nhuman being, was devised and prepared through a\r\nnationwide consultative process, with the full\r\ninvolvement of civil society and the public authorities.\r\nIn this context, the right to development constitutes a\r\nlegitimate aspiration that must be appropriately and\r\ndecisively spurred forward by the United Nations.\r\nEcuador, as a country that is acutely vulnerable to\r\na variety of natural disasters, accords particular\r\nimportance to the role of the United Nations system in\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nthe prevention, mitigation and reduction of the effects\r\nof such disasters, among them the impact of the El\r\nNiño phenomenon. In the quest to move forward with\r\nresearch on this phenomenon — which in 1997 and\r\n1998 affected not only the South Pacific region but\r\nother areas of the world as well — the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council lent\r\ntheir support to the establishment of an International\r\nCentre for the Research of the El Niño Phenomenon, in\r\nthe city of Guayaquíl, in Ecuador. I am pleased to\r\ninform the Assembly that my Government, as host\r\ncountry, has taken the steps necessary to proceed with\r\nthe establishment of that Centre in the next few\r\nmonths, as it is convinced of the scientific contribution\r\nthat such a United Nations-sponsored instrument can\r\nmake to humankind.\r\nEcuador reaffirms its commitment to\r\nmultilateralism and to the ideals that inspired the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. The challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century must be confronted by all\r\ncountries jointly and in a spirit of solidarity. The\r\nMember States must see to it that this session of the\r\nAssembly makes a historic contribution to a universal\r\nendeavour to resolve global problems and to strengthen\r\ncollective security. The achievements of the United\r\nNations in this new century will hinge on a\r\nconstructive spirit of solidarity on the part of all peace-\r\nloving nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to\r\nMr. Rashid Alimov, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nTajikistan.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): Let\r\nme join in the congratulations addressed to Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri and to his country, Finland, on his election to\r\nthe lofty and responsible post of President of the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly. I wish him every\r\nsuccess in guiding the work of the Millennium\r\nAssembly. I should like to take this opportunity also to\r\nexpress our genuine gratitude and to pay due tribute to\r\nMr. Gurirab for his outstanding diplomatic abilities and\r\nfor the evident skill with which he guided the work of\r\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe further the passage of time separates us from\r\nthe Millennium Summit, the more profoundly will we\r\nappreciate its historic outcome. Tajikistan welcomes\r\nthe recommitment by world leaders to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as the key mechanism for the collective\r\nregulation of international relations.\r\nWe remain convinced that there is no alternative\r\nto the United Nations. No one actor is capable of\r\ndealing single-handedly with the new multifaceted\r\nchallenges, risks and threats to international security\r\nand stability. Only through concerted and collective\r\naction on the part of the entire international community\r\ncan we combat phenomena such as severe financial and\r\neconomic crises, regional conflicts, international\r\nterrorism, organized crime and the illicit drug trade.\r\nThe positive results achieved by my country in\r\nthe implementation of the peace process in our nation\r\nare further proof of the key role of the United Nations\r\nin coordinating the efforts of States in the process of\r\nresolving armed conflict.\r\nToday, after seven years of confrontation, peace\r\nprevails in Tajikistan. Following the first multiparty,\r\npluralistic elections in the country’s history, held in\r\nFebruary 2000, Tajik society is living in a new kind of\r\nenvironment and is laying down a sound foundation for\r\nthe sustainable democratic development of the country.\r\nThe considerable support of the international\r\ncommunity, which, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, effectively promoted the advancement of the\r\npeace process in Tajikistan, played a significant part in\r\nthe establishment of peace and stability in the country.\r\nThe Tajik people will always remember the United\r\nNations with gratitude and will always associate this\r\nOrganization with the return of peace, democracy and\r\nconditions for sustainable development to our ancient\r\nland.\r\nOn behalf of President Emomali Rakhmonov, I\r\ntake this opportunity to express our great appreciation\r\nto the Security Council, the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, his special envoys and\r\nrepresentatives, and the leaders of the United Nations\r\nteams and missions in Tajikistan for their enormous\r\ncontribution to the successful completion of the peace\r\nprocess in my country. Our special appreciation goes to\r\nall those States — about 30 — that sent their citizens to\r\nTajikistan as part of the United Nations Mission of\r\nObservers in Tajikistan (UNMOT). The Tajik people\r\nwill for ever keep in their memories the names of those\r\nwho gave their lives so that peace could return to our\r\ncountry.\r\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Development\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the World Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the International Financial\r\nCorporation. They have rendered, and continue to\r\nrender, every possible support to the people and\r\nGovernment of Tajikistan in their efforts to overcome\r\nthe effects of the civil conflict and to rehabilitate the\r\ncountry’s economy.\r\nAt all stages of the peace process the Russian\r\nFederation made a decisive contribution to its\r\nprogressive development. The Russian peacekeepers\r\nand frontier guards who lost their lives serving security\r\nand stability in Tajikistan and Russia will never be\r\nforgotten by our peoples.\r\nThe guarantor States for the implementation of\r\nthe peace agreement — the Russian Federation, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, the Republic of Uzbekistan,\r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Kazakhstan,\r\nTurkmenistan, Pakistan and the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan — rendered considerable support to the\r\nUnited Nations in achieving the successful settlement\r\nof the conflict. The joint efforts of the United Nations,\r\nits specialized agencies, the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nneighbouring States, the United States, the European\r\nUnion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), and of all those others who\r\nsincerely desired to see a peaceful and stable\r\nTajikistan, contributed to the successful\r\nimplementation of the General Agreement on the\r\nEstablishment of Peace and National Accord in\r\nTajikistan, signed in Moscow on 27 June 1997.\r\nWe are fully aware that a huge job of post-\r\nconflict peace-building awaits us. We hope that the\r\nUnited Nations office in Dushanbe will continue to\r\noperate effectively, rendering rehabilitation assistance,\r\nfirst and foremost, in the social and economic spheres.\r\nMuch remains to be done, but what has already been\r\naccomplished at this stage is of great significance for\r\nthe steady, peaceful development of Tajik society and\r\nfor the entire Central and Southern Asia region.\r\nThis is undoubtedly of paramount importance for\r\nthe United Nations, since it constitutes one of the\r\npositive examples of successful activities by our\r\nOrganization in the maintenance of peace and conflict\r\nresolution. We hope that the support for and assistance\r\nto Tajikistan needed to reinforce the gains of the peace\r\nprocess will be intensified. We count on the General\r\nAssembly’s adopting during its current session the\r\ntraditional resolution, normally adopted by consensus,\r\non humanitarian assistance to Tajikistan.\r\nLarge-scale humanitarian assistance is of\r\nparticular importance this year, because in the spring\r\nand summer the whole of Tajikistan was affected by a\r\ndrought on a scale without precedent in the twentieth\r\ncentury. The loss of grain crops on irrigated land\r\nproved to be from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.\r\nAccording to the World Food Programme (WFP), about\r\n3 million people — in other words, every second\r\ncitizen of Tajikistan — is inadequately fed. We greatly\r\nappreciate the Secretary-General’s appeal for food\r\nassistance to the population of Tajikistan most affected\r\nby the drought, and we are deeply grateful to the WFP\r\nand all donor States that responded so promptly and\r\ngenerously to this appeal.\r\nClearly, in the new century United Nations\r\nactivities in the humanitarian sphere, in which it has\r\nalready demonstrated its capabilities, will continue to\r\nplay an important role. We believe that it is necessary\r\nto intensify the cooperation of Member States in this\r\narea in order to increase the international capacity to\r\nrespond to natural and technological disasters. In our\r\nview, this is one of the realistic directions for the\r\ndevelopment of the Organization, which will allow all\r\nto take advantage of the opportunities provided by\r\nglobalization. This is entirely achievable, once the\r\nefforts and capacities of the United Nations and other\r\ninternational economic and financial organizations are\r\nunited. It would provide a demonstration of the global\r\nsolidarity called for by the Secretary-General.\r\nAchieving sustainable development and ensuring\r\nthe equitable consideration of the interests of both\r\npresent and future generations on a global scale is one\r\nof the most serious challenges of the new century.\r\nToday we are not far from that boundary beyond which\r\nthe processes of destruction of the natural mechanisms\r\nregulating the environment and global changes become\r\nirreversible. Our common objective is to meet the ever\r\nincreasing needs of human development in the\r\neconomic and social spheres, while not simply\r\npreserving, but gradually restoring natural ecosystems\r\nto conditions that will guarantee environmental\r\nsustainability.\r\nMuch has been accomplished in this area over the\r\nlast decade. Agenda 21, adopted at the Rio de Janeiro\r\nConference, has become a fundamental document\r\ndefining the main area of activities of the international\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\ncommunity on this topic. However, the dimensions of\r\nthe task faced by humanity require extra coordinated\r\nefforts. Alongside the long-term problems, such as\r\nclimate change, the preservation of biodiversity, and\r\ndesertification, new ones are emerging, demanding\r\ncareful consideration and concerted action. One is the\r\nproblem of fresh water, a resource which is being\r\ngradually depleted. Depletion of ground waters has\r\nbecome a serious problem. According to some\r\nforecasts, by 2050 the population of the planet will not\r\nhave an adequate water supply. The problem of\r\ndrinking water is multifaceted and is not confined to\r\npurely economic issues.\r\nIn “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations\r\nin the twenty-first century” the Secretary-General drew\r\nattention to the fact that, in order to have a sustainable\r\nfuture, it is absolutely essential that the international\r\ncommunity tackle the current fresh water problems.\r\nMajor concern about this question has been expressed\r\nby many non-governmental organizations, as well as by\r\nthe private sector. It has already been discussed at\r\ninternational conferences, including, at the ministerial\r\nlevel, the Second World Water Forum held in The\r\nHague, the Netherlands last spring, and it will be\r\ndiscussed at the forthcoming International Conference\r\non water problems to be held in Bonn, Germany. All\r\nthese steps, aimed at giving profound consideration to\r\nthe matter and elaborating proper coordinated action by\r\nthe international community, are precisely the purposes\r\nserved by the initiative put forward by our President a\r\nyear ago to proclaim 2003 the international year of\r\nfreshwater. We hope that the relevant resolution will be\r\nadopted by consensus at this session. We would be well\r\nadvised to recall our relationship with the two atoms of\r\nhydrogen and one of oxygen that, bound together in\r\nnature, support our lives on earth.\r\nWhile the twenty-first century may present new\r\ntrials for humanity, that which recently ended\r\nchallenged the international community with the urgent\r\nnecessity jointly to combat international terrorism, the\r\ndrug trade and organized crime. The situation in many\r\nregions of the planet demands that the United Nations\r\nmobilize even greater international efforts to counteract\r\nthese horrible phenomena more actively.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan in particular\r\nendangers regional and international security. The\r\ninter-Afghan crisis has transformed that country into a\r\nstronghold of international terrorism and made it the\r\nworld leader in drug production. The situation in\r\nAfghanistan was recently the subject of a thorough\r\ndiscussion at a meeting of the Group of 6+2, held at the\r\nlevel of Foreign Ministers. Tajikistan is firmly\r\nconvinced that there can be no military solution to the\r\nAfghan crisis; any victory by any party to the conflict\r\nwill be temporary and will not lead to the\r\nestablishment of peace and stability in that country.\r\nOnly the United Nations, in cooperation with the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, is capable of\r\nuntying the tight knot of the Afghan crisis. Tajikistan\r\nfully approves of the activities of the United Nations\r\nSpecial Mission to Afghanistan and its Head, Mr.\r\nVendrell. We express our hope that additional resolute\r\nmeasures to be undertaken by the Security Council and\r\nthe entire international community will eventually\r\nallow the fire of war that has raged in that country for\r\n20 years to be extinguished. Otherwise, as we have\r\nalready seen, the terrorist and narcotic threats to\r\nregional and global security emanating from\r\nAfghanistan will continue to grow.\r\nOur duty is to help the Afghan people to return to\r\na dignified and peaceful life and to erect a reliable\r\nbarrier to the heroin-fuelled aggression and the\r\ncultivation of international terrorism encouraged by the\r\nTaliban, which threaten not only the countries\r\nbordering Afghanistan, but also those located far\r\nbeyond the region. We are convinced that it will\r\nbecome possible to find a formula for peace and a way\r\nout of the Afghan deadlock only through our joint\r\nefforts and the leadership of the United Nations.\r\nIn order to continue playing a key role in world\r\naffairs, the United Nations must continuously renew\r\nitself. Much has already been done to that end thanks\r\nto the important initiatives and effective actions of the\r\nSecretary-General. However, a number of issues that\r\ncould have a real impact on the efficiency of the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century — inter alia,\r\nexpanding the Security Council’s membership — have\r\nyet to be addressed. Tajikistan is in favour of\r\nincreasing the efficiency, balance and representation of\r\nthe Security Council by incorporating highly\r\nindustrialized countries, such as Japan and Germany,\r\nand influential developing States into its membership.\r\nWe hope that this issue will be resolved with the\r\nbroadest possible support.\r\nEach session of the General Assembly provides\r\nus with a unique opportunity to develop a unified\r\napproach and to coordinate our actions at the global\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nlevel for the sake of a truly democratic, secure and\r\nsustainable development of humanity. The Summit of\r\nworld leaders, unprecedented in the history of\r\nmankind, has given our Organization a powerful\r\npolitical impetus with which to enter the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The Millennium Assembly should preserve\r\nthis momentum and use it rationally for the sake of\r\nstrengthening the community of nations and our\r\ncommon future.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ioannis Kasoulides, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Kasoulides (Cyprus): I would like to extend\r\nmy warmest congratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his well-\r\ndeserved election as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-fifth session. I am certain that his\r\nconsiderable experience and diplomatic skills will\r\nguide the work of this session to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-\r\nBen Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNamibia, for the exceptional manner in which he\r\npresided over the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nEarlier this month, in this very Hall, an\r\nunprecedented gathering of heads of State took\r\nplace — an event that, through the final Declaration,\r\nhas given new impetus to enhanced international\r\ncooperation to tackle an array of international\r\nproblems. The Millennium Assembly has expressed the\r\nstrong will of the peoples of this planet for common\r\naction so that humanity can proceed with the\r\nconstruction of a better world.\r\nCyprus reaffirms its commitment to the United\r\nNations, which we have always considered and\r\ncontinue to consider to be the foundation on which the\r\ninternational community can pursue the lofty goals of\r\npeace, security, justice, respect for human rights, and\r\nsocial and economic development on a global level. We\r\nthus fully support the continuing efforts towards the\r\nreform of the Organization, including its principal\r\norgans, so that it will be able to successfully face the\r\nmany international challenges. For, just as all living\r\norganisms are constantly evolving in order to adapt and\r\nsurvive in an ever-changing environment, so does the\r\nUnited Nations need always to have the necessary\r\nstructures and means that will make it as effective as\r\npossible.\r\nCyprus welcomes the efforts of the United\r\nNations in the area of disarmament and we are\r\nparticularly pleased at the successful conclusion earlier\r\nthis year of the review process of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We would like\r\nto congratulate the Russian Federation for its recent\r\nratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty and the START II Treaty. We consider the\r\nexpansion of the regime of nuclear-free zones,\r\nincluding one in our region of the Mediterranean, to be\r\nan important component in our goal towards a nuclear-\r\nfree world.\r\nThe illicit trafficking of small arms is an issue of\r\ngrave concern. We are fully supportive of international\r\nefforts in this direction and consider more effective\r\naction to eliminate this phenomenon to be an\r\nimperative need of our increasingly interdependent\r\nworld.\r\nIn countless reports of the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies, the concern is evident regarding\r\nthe continuing degradation of the environment and the\r\nimperative need for global policies in the pursuit of\r\nsustainable development. The effects of overpopulation\r\nand unregulated development will undoubtedly create\r\nnew pressures on the environment in this new century.\r\nSmall island States facing their vulnerability to global\r\nwarming, rising water level and the increasing scarcity\r\nof water resources are particularly concerned in this\r\narea. We are particularly pleased with the organization\r\nin Cyprus next January of the workshop on energy for\r\nsustainable development, a capacity-development\r\ninitiative of the Alliance of Small Island States. We\r\nexpect this workshop to make a substantive input to the\r\nninth session of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe effects of globalization were extensively\r\ndiscussed by world leaders at the Millennium Summit.\r\nI will therefore limit myself in this statement to only\r\none aspect of the whole question of the impact of\r\nglobalization, which we consider a major problem that\r\nwe all have an obligation to address. The eradication of\r\npoverty is undeniably one of the major challenges that\r\nthe international community faces. It is imperative that\r\nnew and imaginative policies to attack the problem be\r\ndeveloped, with the Member States of the United\r\nNations and the major international financial\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\ninstitutions working in close cooperation on this issue.\r\nDebt relief should be a central part of these efforts.\r\nThe progress achieved since the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which was adopted more\r\nthan half a century ago, has been considerable. The\r\ninternational regime of human rights instruments has\r\nbeen continually expanding and constitutes the\r\ncriterion against which the international community\r\nand national Governments are judged as to their\r\ndedication and actions in the protection of human\r\nrights. The United Nations has been at the forefront of\r\nthese new winds of hope for humankind. The subject of\r\nhuman rights today encompasses a variety of topics.\r\nWe are very pleased at the successful conclusion of the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on women and\r\nthe follow-up conference on social development, which\r\nwere held earlier this year in New York and Geneva\r\nrespectively. We look forward to continuing on this\r\npath at the upcoming world conference on racism,\r\nxenophobia and related intolerance and at the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on children.\r\nOne of the areas of particular concern to Cyprus\r\nis the increasing number of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons throughout the world. Cyprus has\r\nitself experienced the tragic consequences of mass\r\ndisplacement and ethnic cleansing. The vast majority\r\nof displaced people — more than 22 million people,\r\naccording to the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees — are women and\r\nchildren, who are particularly vulnerable to gross\r\nviolations of their human rights. We strongly believe\r\nthat the international community has an obligation to\r\nmore forcefully secure the right of return of these\r\nrefugees to their places of residence.\r\nCyprus welcomes the withdrawal of Israeli forces\r\nfrom Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425\r\n(1978)of the Security Council. We would like to\r\nconsider this as a harbinger of the achievement of a\r\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East question.\r\nDespite the temporary setback in the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nfinal-status negotiations, we believe that the process\r\ncan and should move forward, so that peace, stability\r\nand prosperity will finally be established in this long-\r\ntormented region. Cyprus supports the implementation\r\nof the relevant resolutions of the Security Council in\r\nthis respect.\r\nCyprus fully supports Security Council resolution\r\n1244 (1999) and calls for the full respect of the human\r\nrights of all the inhabitants of Kosovo, irrespective of\r\ntheir origin, as well as for the full respect for the\r\nsovereignty, the territorial integrity and the democratic\r\nprocess of all States in the region. We also commend\r\nthe European Union for its considerable initiatives and\r\nsupport for the economic and political stabilization of\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe.\r\nWe have been encouraged by the positive climate\r\nthat has existed since the June meeting between the\r\nNorth and South Korean leaders. We express our\r\nsupport for further measures to achieve reconciliation,\r\nstability and cooperation in the Korean peninsula. We\r\nhave been heartened by the prospect of reunification\r\nand of the termination of the division in this sensitive\r\nregion.\r\nCyprus fully supports the process for the\r\nestablishment of an international criminal court and\r\nwas one of the original signatories of the Rome Statute.\r\nWe look forward to further progress in the work of the\r\nPreparatory Commission for the International Criminal\r\nCourt and welcome the results of its last session\r\nregarding the consensus reached on the rules of\r\nprocedure and evidence and the elements of crime. Our\r\nsupport stems from our firm belief that if we are to live\r\nin a world where justice and international law prevail,\r\nthen impunity for abhorrent crimes against humanity\r\nshould end immediately. Cyprus, itself a victim of such\r\ncrimes, knows very well the bitter truth of impunity.\r\nFor the last 26 years the General Assembly has\r\nincluded in its agenda the question of Cyprus.\r\nDecisions by this Assembly, in particular resolution\r\n3212 (XXIX), as well as successive Security Council\r\nresolutions, call for the restoration of the territorial\r\nintegrity, unity and independence of the Republic of\r\nCyprus and the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and\r\nsettlers from an independent country, Member of the\r\nUnited Nations, which was invaded in 1974 and whose\r\nterritory, 37 per cent of it, is controlled by the Turkish\r\noccupation army.\r\nAn attempt has been made from this rostrum to\r\ngive a different version from and interpretation of the\r\none upheld and understood by this General Assembly\r\nand by the Security Council. When one talks about the\r\nevents of 1963, one should not forget the armed\r\ninsurgency against the legal Government of the\r\nRepublic and the deliberate decision of the Turkish\r\nCypriot leadership to withdraw its representatives from\r\nParliament and the organs of the Government, in order\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nto pave the way for the present de facto division of the\r\nisland.\r\nFurthermore, it is well known and confirmed by\r\nthe three reports of the European Commission of\r\nHuman Rights, following appeals by the Republic of\r\nCyprus against Turkey, that ethnic cleansing occurred\r\nin Cyprus in 1974 with the violent uprooting of one-\r\nthird of the Cypriot population from their homes and\r\ntheir expulsion from the areas that are now under\r\nTurkish occupation. This is a classic example of a\r\ncreation of faits accomplis through the use of force.\r\nEnough has already been said about history, and\r\nmany recriminations were levelled by one side against\r\nthe other. We have said time and again to our Turkish\r\nCypriot compatriots, and we repeat to the Government\r\nof Turkey, that it is high time we looked to the future.\r\nA future bright and prosperous for all Cypriots,\r\npermeated by a spirit of reconciliation, in a peaceful,\r\ndemilitarized and reunited Cyprus, member of the\r\nEuropean Union, in which all Cypriots would live in\r\nconditions of peace, prosperity and the full protection\r\nof their human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nWe want a future without occupation armies,\r\nwithout barbed wires of division and without human\r\nsuffering. Indeed, how can one seriously claim that the\r\nmassive Turkish military force which invaded and has\r\ncontinued to occupy 37 per cent of Cypriot territory for\r\nthe last 26 years is a force of pacification and\r\nliberation? Had these forces been pacification or\r\nliberation troops, as Turkey tries to portray them,\r\nwould the Security Council, which represents the\r\ncollective wisdom of the international community, call\r\nrepeatedly for their withdrawal? Moreover, how can\r\nanyone, speaking before this body, describe United\r\nNations resolutions and their call to uphold and adhere\r\nto international law as romantic descriptions and\r\nunrealistic assessments?\r\nOne further point that I would like to make is the\r\nreference to the so-called realities in Cyprus. We have\r\nbeen asked to accept, if we want to find a solution,\r\nthese so-called realities on the ground. These realities\r\nare, of course, the result of the Turkish invasion and its\r\ndire consequences on the people of Cyprus. One such\r\nstark reality reflecting the ultimate aims of Turkey in\r\nCyprus is the importation of 98,000 Turkish mainland\r\nsettlers into the occupied areas in an effort to change\r\nthe demographic structure of the island. Another reality\r\nis the mass emigration of our fellow Turkish Cypriots\r\nfrom the occupied areas and the constant threat posed\r\nby the 36,000 Turkish occupation troops stationed on\r\nthe island. This threat is real and manifests itself from\r\ntime to time through provocative actions on the ground.\r\nSuch is the case of the Turkish advance in Strovilia,\r\nfollowing the adoption last June of a resolution by the\r\nSecurity Council renewing the mandate of the United\r\nNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).\r\nThis illegal action has been described by the United\r\nNations Secretary-General as a clear violation of the\r\nstatus quo. The inability of the Organization to return\r\nthe situation to the status quo ante tarnishes its image\r\nand credibility. Could one imagine the consequences\r\nfor international relations, when nations are forced to\r\naccept solutions based on faits accomplis created and\r\nsustained through the use of military force and\r\nunilateral acts? Can we allow such a precedent to pave\r\nthe way for the disintegration of so many countries\r\naround the globe? What, indeed, would be the\r\nconsequences for small States in this kind of so-called\r\ninternational order, where international law is\r\nselectively applied and the will of the mighty reigns\r\nsupreme?\r\nThe one and only reality is the imperative need\r\nfor peace and reconciliation in Cyprus through a\r\nmutually acceptable solution within the parameters of\r\nUnited Nations resolutions. We are currently engaged\r\nin the fourth round of proximity talks. We have come\r\nto these talks with flexibility and with the political will\r\nto reach a solution as prescribed by this Organization.\r\nWe appeal to the Turkish side to seize the moment and\r\ncapitalize on the current favourable environment in\r\norder to reach a comprehensive settlement. Such a\r\nsettlement will be based on Security Council\r\nresolutions, which call for a bi-zonal, bi-communal\r\nFederal Republic of Cyprus, with a single sovereignty,\r\ncitizenship and international personality, comprising\r\ntwo politically equal communities, as described in\r\nSecurity Council resolution 750 (1992). The Turkish\r\nside must realize that a solution must be mutually\r\nacceptable and based on international law, and it must\r\nnot insist on imposing its will and on a solution based\r\non faits accomplis.\r\nOur common aim should be a solution that would\r\nbe honourable and something to be cherished by future\r\ngenerations of all Cypriots, Greek and Turkish alike, to\r\nwhom our utmost purpose is to bequeath a better place\r\nto live in harmony, tolerance and cooperation.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia, His Excellency Mr. Masao Nakayama.\r\n` Mr. Nakayama (Micronesia): I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate the President on\r\nhis assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nmembers of the Pacific Island Forum group of\r\ncountries at the United Nations, comprising Australia,\r\nFiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand,\r\nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon\r\nIslands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country,\r\nMicronesia.\r\nIt is with pride that I congratulate and extend a\r\nwarm welcome to our Pacific Island neighbour Tuvalu\r\ninto the United Nations family. The members of our\r\ngroup may vary greatly in land and ocean areas,\r\npopulation, resource endowment, economic\r\ndevelopment, social structures, languages and cultures,\r\nbut we share a common goal for the Pacific, based on\r\nsecurity and stability, as well as prosperity and\r\neconomic opportunities for its peoples, and the\r\nsustainability of resources. Within the same context the\r\nPacific Islands Forum countries represented in New\r\nYork reaffirm their commitment to play a supportive\r\nrole in the United Nations decolonization programmes\r\nin respect of the remaining non-self-governing\r\nterritories in the Pacific.\r\nThe Pacific Ocean occupies a central place in the\r\nlives of the people of the Pacific Islands. Preservation\r\nof this resource — which contains the world’s highest\r\nmarine diversity — is critical to our future economic\r\ndevelopment. The vast oceanic area under the control\r\nof our members is rich in fishing potential but requires\r\ncareful management and monitoring to address illegal,\r\nunregulated and unreported fishing and other\r\nenvironmental threats. A major achievement for us and\r\nour distant-water fishing partners is the convention\r\nrecently adopted by the Multilateral High-Level\r\nConference on the Conservation and Management of\r\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and\r\nCentral Pacific, which will protect the world’s last\r\ngreat tuna fishery.\r\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Open-\r\nended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nLaw of the Sea, under the co-chairmanship of the\r\nAmbassador of Samoa, promises to serve as a vital part\r\nof the preparatory process for the General Assembly’s\r\nconsideration of ocean issues. The ocean priorities\r\nidentified by the Pacific Island Forum include\r\nratification of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea and the United Nations agreement on\r\nfish stocks; marine scientific research and technical\r\nassistance; and the delimitation of maritime zones,\r\nincluding continental shelves.\r\nThe world’s security environment has become\r\nmore fluid and uncertain with new and emerging\r\nthreats. Events this year show that a reputation for\r\nstability and peace are by no means guaranteed in the\r\nPacific. In light of the political crisis in Fiji and the\r\nsocial unrest in the Solomon Islands, Foreign Ministers\r\nof the Forum met in Samoa in August. They recognized\r\nthe need for regional action to be taken on the basis of\r\nall members being part of the Pacific Islands extended\r\nfamily. In doing so the Forum must demonstrate that it\r\nis prepared constructively to address difficult and\r\nsensitive issues, including the underlying causes of\r\ntensions and conflicts, such as ethnicity, socio-\r\neconomic disparities, lack of good governance, land\r\ndisputes and erosion of cultural values. Accordingly,\r\nthey decided to recommend to the Pacific Island Forum\r\nmeeting in Tarawa, Kiribati, that leaders commit\r\nthemselves and their countries to a number of\r\nfundamental principles and courses of actions,\r\nincluding the following: belief in liberty of the\r\nindividual under the law, equal rights for all citizens\r\nregardless of gender, race, colour, creed, political belief\r\nand in the individual’s inalienable right to participate\r\nby means of a free and democratic political process in\r\nframing the society in which he or she lives; upholding\r\ndemocratic processes and institutions which reflect\r\nnational and local circumstances, including the\r\npeaceful transfer of power, the rule of law and the\r\nindependence of the judiciary, just and honest\r\ngovernment and recognizing the importance and\r\nurgency of equitable economic, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment to satisfy the basic needs and aspirations\r\nof the people of the Forum.\r\nThe ministers established a working group to\r\ndevelop these principles, and options for action in\r\ncases where the principles have been violated, for\r\nconsideration by Forum leaders when they meet in\r\nKiribati.\r\nIn addition to increasing incidents of civil unrest,\r\nthe region is facing new threats from international,\r\nfinancial and cyber crime and people-smuggling, as\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nwell as the challenge of preventing and controlling\r\ncommunicable diseases and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nThe threat associated with uncontrolled access to even\r\na small number of weapons was brought into stark\r\nrelief in the region recently, adding weight to the\r\nForum leaders’ decision in 1997 to put in place\r\nregional cooperation and a legal framework to control\r\nthe spread of weapons in the region. This approach is\r\nin step with international efforts to combat the illicit\r\ntrade in small arms, particularly in the lead-up to the\r\n2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.\r\nWork on a legal framework has progressed to a point\r\nwhere we expect draft legislation to be circulated\r\namong Forum island countries before the end of this\r\nyear.\r\nWe in the Pacific retain a close relationship, in\r\nboth economic and cultural terms, with our natural\r\nenvironment. We therefore maintain a keen interest in\r\nthe development of the Environmental Vulnerability\r\nIndex. We thank the several Governments that have\r\nkindly committed substantial funds for the completion\r\nof the third phase of the studies being conducted by the\r\nSouth Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission\r\n(SOPAC), and encourage its adoption by the United\r\nNations so that the environmental and natural risks that\r\nour members face are recognized when consideration is\r\ngiven to eligibility for concessional aid, trade treatment\r\nand least-developed-country status.\r\nAgenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States remain the basic guideline for\r\nprotecting the environment and achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Steady progress is required in the\r\npreparations for the 10-year review of the United\r\nNations Conference on the Environment and\r\nDevelopment, to take place in 2002. We give high\r\npriority to international efforts to have the Kyoto\r\nProtocol come into force at the earliest possible date.\r\nWe are thus committed to achieving a successful\r\noutcome to the sixth session of the Conference of the\r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention\r\non Climate Change, to be held in November. We\r\nwelcome the formulation of specific tools, such as the\r\nClean Development Mechanism, which promise to be\r\nuseful in enabling island countries to do our part to\r\ncombat climate change and to adapt to its consequences\r\nwithin the parameters of our own national\r\ncircumstances.\r\nStrengthened efforts are being made in the region\r\nto build capacity to understand and respond to climate\r\nchange, including through observational networks. The\r\nsmall island nations of the Pacific face unique\r\nconstraints on development. Most have small\r\nsubsistence-based economies with a narrow export\r\nbase. Forum economic ministers meeting in July\r\nreconfirmed their commitment to the process of\r\neconomic reform, based on the principle of good\r\ngovernance, with the aim of providing a sound\r\neconomic basis upon which social development can\r\ntake place.\r\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) remains\r\nthe world’s most significant international opportunity\r\nfor the negotiation of trade and commercial issues. The\r\nPacific Island Forum has agreed to establish a Forum\r\ndelegation in Geneva and a working group of Forum\r\ntrade officials to improve cooperation in the WTO and\r\nto actively engage in the policy debate about the best\r\nway to enhance the role of the WTO in contributing to\r\ndevelopment. We recognize the importance of finding\r\nways to ensure that trade reform delivers outcomes\r\nwhich will contribute not only to economic growth, but\r\nalso to the advancement of development and social\r\nequity objectives and improved environmental\r\noutcomes.\r\nThe global information economy promises great\r\nopportunities, particularly for those in isolated areas\r\nsuch as the Pacific, but it also demands new skills and\r\ntechnology. Efficient and effective communications\r\nservices, including a dedicated modern network system\r\nlike the Small Island Developing States Network\r\n(SIDSNET), are of critical importance in achieving\r\neconomic and social development and overcoming the\r\nconstraints resulting from the relatively high cost\r\nstructures of telecommunication networks for Forum\r\nisland countries. A Forum vision for the Pacific\r\ninformation economy seeks to develop an appropriate\r\nmechanism for the cooperation of regional regulators\r\nand relevant organizations. Education and training are\r\nof fundamental importance to enhancing the\r\nadaptability of Pacific islanders to economic reform in\r\na rapidly changing world and region. By supporting\r\neducation, the United Nations can help overcome one\r\nof the major obstacles to economic growth and poverty\r\nreduction.\r\nThe United Nations system continues to play a\r\nvital role in protecting the interests of small island\r\nStates, such as most of the members of the Pacific\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.26\r\nIsland Forum. It is essential that the United Nations\r\nremain strong by adapting to meet new challenges such\r\nas globalization. At the same time, the central role of\r\nthe General Assembly, with its universal membership,\r\nshould be strengthened. The Security Council should\r\nbe made more representative, transparent and\r\ndemocratic so as to be able to respond to the\r\nrequirements of a fundamentally different international\r\nsetting. It needs to be reformed comprehensively to\r\nmeet contemporary demands and the conditions of the\r\nworld today.\r\nWe welcome the Brahimi report (A/55/305) and\r\nlook forward to the strengthening of the ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to carry out its key peacekeeping role.\r\nTo fulfil its collective security responsibilities, the\r\nUnited Nations must be afforded strong and sustained\r\npolitical support, together with financial and\r\ninstitutional resources. An integral element is a more\r\nequitable scale for determining peacekeeping funding.\r\nThe Pacific Island Forum group remains\r\ncommitted to ensuring an effective United Nations.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof the General Assembly to document A/INF/55/3,\r\nwhich contains a partial programme of work and\r\nschedule of plenary meetings and which has been\r\ndistributed in the Hall.
