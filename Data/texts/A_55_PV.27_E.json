(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nthe Honourable Elvin Nimrod, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Grenada.\r\nMr. Nimrod (Grenada): My delegation greets and\r\ncongratulates you, Sir, for presiding over the\r\ndeliberations of the fifty-fifth session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly — the Millennium\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, the distinguished Foreign Minister of\r\nNamibia, for his effective and dynamic conduct of the\r\nfifty-fourth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly, including the preparations for the\r\nMillennium Summit and the President’s Report.\r\nCongratulations are also extended to our\r\ndistinguished Secretary-General, who with great vision\r\nconceptualized the Millennium Summit, the execution\r\nof which was a great triumph for the United Nations.\r\nA hearty welcome is extended to the small\r\nsovereign State of Tuvalu, as it joins the family of\r\nnations.\r\nThe Millennium Summit and this fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly are\r\nhistoric events that provide a unique opportunity to\r\nview humanity’s progress and face the challenges\r\nbefore us.\r\nIndeed, the Summit Declaration sets out a global\r\nvision for the twenty-first century. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the inclusion of commitments to fight\r\npoverty, disease, ignorance, injustice, violence and\r\ndegradation of the environment, among others.\r\nIn the matter of poverty and disease, the United\r\nNations must address the inequalities that exist around\r\nthe world. In this twenty-first century, more than 1.2\r\nbillion people live on less than one dollar a day.\r\nMillions of children and the elderly go to bed hungry.\r\nDisease and sickness wreak havoc on the lives of\r\nchildren, men and women. Today the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic cuts short the lives of millions of people who\r\ncould be making useful and productive contributions to\r\nour world.\r\nTrade is vital to the livelihood of Grenadians. For\r\nthe banana-exporting countries of the Caribbean\r\nsubregion, which includes Grenada, the export of\r\nbananas accounts for a significant percentage of\r\nforeign exchange. However, our economies are\r\nthreatened by the callous ruling of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) against the European Union\r\nbanana regime of assistance to our small growers.\r\nOur struggling farmers, with limited acreage, find\r\nit difficult, if not impossible, to compete with a\r\ntransnational corporation. Our farmers need an\r\nadjustment period in order to effect the requisite\r\nstructural changes needed by the new trade regime. We\r\nlook to the United Nations to call upon the WTO to\r\ntake into consideration the special structural problems\r\nfaced by the small banana producers of the Caribbean.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nWe call for corporate responsibility. We appeal\r\nfor measures to encourage the sustainability of small\r\neconomies and economies in transition. We urge a\r\nmore equitable global partnership.\r\nYou may recall that the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment, including the Prime Minister of Grenada,\r\nstressed recently in this very hall the urgency of\r\nreleasing poor developing countries from their debt\r\nburden. The leaders expressed an interest in finding\r\nnew approaches and new thinking with respect to this\r\nproblem. A solution should be vigorously pursued with\r\ndeliberate speed.\r\nDebt forgiveness is not a financial loss to the\r\nglobal economy. Rather, it provides an opportunity for\r\nstimulation in the depressed and stagnant parts of the\r\nworld’s economy. Investing the dividends realized by\r\ndebt forgiveness in the economy of the debtor\r\ndeveloping countries — especially the least developed\r\nand those with economies in transition — would be a\r\nmajor investment in global development.\r\nAnother area that needs urgent and immediate\r\nassistance from the international community is that of\r\nnatural disasters. The costly restoration of\r\ninfrastructure and rehabilitation of the productive\r\nsectors, especially agriculture and tourism, and the\r\nhigh cost of recovering and rebuilding make the\r\nattainment of sustainable development a monumental\r\ntask.\r\nMy delegation calls upon the United Nations and\r\nits agencies, the International Monetary Fund, the\r\nWorld Bank and other international agencies, as well as\r\nthe private and public sectors in global partnership,\r\nincluding the Global Compact, to contribute to a well-\r\nstructured disaster relief fund, a relief fund that can\r\nrespond quickly and effectively.\r\nA large percentage of the needs of the developing\r\ncountries in the Caribbean subregion and elsewhere can\r\nbe met. We look forward to positive developments\r\nenvisaged from globalization, trade liberalization,\r\ninformation technology and sustainable development.\r\nThese and other well-conceived programmes must be\r\nseriously pursued. Lip service is not enough.\r\nAs the Secretary-General noted in his report to\r\nthe fifty-fifth General Assembly on the work of the\r\nOrganization: “To some, globalization is imbued with\r\ngreat promise; to others, it appears deeply threatening.”\r\n(A/55/1, para. 13)\r\nThe international community must help to ensure\r\nthat the have-nots are on board this fast-moving train\r\nof globalization. All Member States need to share in\r\nthe opportunities provided by globalization. This would\r\nact as a vehicle for international peace and economic\r\nsecurity.\r\nRemoving some of the barriers to trade and\r\ncapital flow are prerequisites to successful reduction of\r\npoverty and disease in the developing countries. This\r\ncan be mutually beneficial to developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nTrade has been the engine of economic growth\r\nand development from the days of bartering to the\r\npresent day of e-commerce and globalization. We\r\ntherefore regard the unilateral interference in our\r\noffshore services sector as an attempt to hinder our\r\ntrade in services and our role in the global economy.\r\nIn that connection, my delegation recalls the\r\nwords of my Prime Minister about the unfair charges\r\nlevelled against our offshore financial-services sector.\r\n“A cartel of high-tax nations, comprising\r\nthe richest and most powerful countries, has\r\nlaunched a destructive and high-powered attack\r\non our country, accusing us of anti-competitive\r\ntax practices. Threats, imperialistic pressures and\r\nabuse of power in multilateral organizations are\r\nbeing used to force many small States, including\r\nGrenada, to give up our fiscal sovereignty. They\r\nhave used adverse publicity techniques\r\ndeliberately to condemn and harm our economies.\r\nThey have threatened various sanctions, sought to\r\nblock access to capital funds in multinational\r\norganizations and to impose financial\r\nprotectionism and total ostracism.”\r\nThat is fiscal imperialism. It tramples on the principle\r\nof sovereign equality. It is contrary to international law,\r\nand it undermines freedom of competition, global\r\ninvestment and trade liberalization.\r\nThe role of education in poverty alleviation, in\r\nthe application of science and technology and in the\r\nvast area of information sharing and communications is\r\nvital. The Government of Grenada, recognizing the\r\nsocial, cultural and economic potential of education, is\r\ninvesting an increasing proportion of its limited\r\nresources to prepare its people to participate in, and\r\nbenefit from, the information and technology\r\nrevolution. Towards that end, the Government of\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nGrenada is seeking the assistance of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the World Bank and\r\nagencies and donors of goodwill to establish a new\r\nprogramme of distance learning by means of global\r\ncomputer interconnectivity.\r\nGrenada attaches great importance to the\r\nconvening in 2001 of the United Nations High-level\r\nIntergovernmental Event on Financing for\r\nDevelopment. My delegation welcomes the attempt to\r\naddress monetary, trade and financial issues in a\r\nholistic manner and in the context of globalization and\r\nsustainable development. The international community\r\nshould not miss this opportunity to focus attention and\r\nresources on the pursuit of development, peace and\r\nstability.\r\nAnd here, my delegation reaffirms that the root\r\ncause of conflict within nations and among nations can\r\nbe found in some of the injustice done to the weaker\r\nmembers of the international community by the\r\nstronger ones. Unless the basics of life — food,\r\nclothing, shelter, health and employment — are\r\nattained, human rights and the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights will be meaningless to those who suffer\r\nsuch extreme deprivations. This is especially so in the\r\ncontext of economic, social and cultural rights, which\r\nare downplayed in favour of civil and political rights.\r\nSince all human rights are universal, indivisible,\r\ninterdependent and interrelated, attention to the full\r\nrange of rights will contribute better to the observance\r\nand enjoyment of this noble goal.\r\nI join my Prime Minister in paying tribute to, and\r\npublicly thanking, the Government and the people of\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan for the assistance\r\ngiven to Grenada with respect to agriculture, marine\r\nresources, education, health, culture and infrastructure.\r\nThe friendship and sincerity of the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan have been a source of strength and\r\nendurance for our two countries. 1t is in this spirit that\r\nGrenada calls once more for the return of the Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan to full membership of the United\r\nNations. A people that diligently works to achieve such\r\nhigh levels of human and technological development\r\nand a people that makes such positive contributions to\r\nthe global economy must become a full Member of this\r\ngreat organization, the United Nations.\r\nFinally, we must seek to ensure that the\r\nOrganization is responsive to the ever-changing global\r\nenvironment. Let us ensure that we address the needs\r\nof our peoples. And let us move forward with a United\r\nNations that is prepared to fuel the engine that would\r\nbring about more equitable participation in the global\r\ncommunity. Let us always put people first and be\r\nguided by God.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the acting\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdullah Abdullah.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Afghanistan): On my way to the\r\nAssembly Hall, I was informed by the Supreme State\r\nCouncil of the Islamic State of Afghanistan that in a\r\nself-evident act of aggression hundreds of Pakistani\r\nmilitary personnel — army, plain-clothes personnel and\r\narmed Taliban — are reported to have been positioned\r\nin the Shah Salim pass dividing the Pakistan border\r\ntown of Chitral from north-eastern Afghanistan, bound\r\nfor an attack on Badakhshan province.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nassumption of the major task of presiding over the\r\nimportant millennium session of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to congratulate the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on\r\nhis excellent leadership of the fifty-fourth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, which set the stage for the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nThree years ago, I stood before the Assembly and\r\nstated from this very rostrum that, as the crisis in\r\nAfghanistan continued to unfold, we had to ask, and\r\nanswer, important questions. At the time, I spoke of the\r\ndark and ominous movement known as the Taliban,\r\nwhich, backed by cross-border troops, had invaded\r\nAfghanistan. This year, at its millennium session, the\r\nGeneral Assembly indeed has to answer major\r\nquestions. One among many is the silence the world\r\nhas chosen to keep in dealing with the Taliban and their\r\nPakistani supporters. With the spread of Talibanism,\r\nwhich has led to the abject misery of the Afghan\r\nnation, massive insurgency and turmoil in the region\r\nand beyond, is it not high time that the international\r\ncommunity put a stop to the Pakistani-operated Taliban\r\nprocessing machine? Certainly, mere rhetoric and\r\ninadequate reactions are not enough. It is with this\r\nview that I should like to focus my statement entirely\r\non the situation in Afghanistan and its devastating\r\nregional and international implications, within the\r\ngiven time limit.\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nA question arises: what has been the result of the\r\nTalibanization of the occupied parts of Afghanistan? In\r\nan age of information and globalization, it has been a\r\nreign of terror imposed by a religious police, abuse in\r\nthe name of religion, the elimination of all freedoms\r\nand civil liberties, massive violations of human rights,\r\ndegrading and tormenting treatment of men and\r\nwomen, trafficking of women and girls, the forced\r\nseparation of women from their menfolk, the random\r\nand deliberate round-up of individuals based on their\r\nethnic and religious origins, the practice of scorched-\r\nearth policy, the torching and total obliteration of\r\nfarmlands, orchards and other means of livelihood, the\r\ncontamination of water resources, the forcible dispatch\r\nof children and adults to the battlefields, the removal of\r\nall but rudimentary religious education — for male\r\nstudents only — with the closure of all schools for\r\nfemales, the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian\r\naid, the intensification of battles, an exacerbation of the\r\nsituation, widespread terrorism and the destruction of\r\nthe historical heritage and artefacts of Afghanistan in\r\norder to alienate the Afghan nation from its ancestry\r\nand historical identity.\r\nThe objective of the Pakistani military\r\nintelligence establishment, known as Inter-Services\r\nIntelligence (ISI), through the imposition of the so-\r\ncalled Islamic Emirate of the Taliban, has been to\r\ncreate instability in Central and South Asia by means\r\nof terrorism. This “Islamic Emirate” has instituted\r\nMullah Omar, the militia’s leader, as the undisputed\r\nAmir-ul-Mo’mineen, meaning “Commander of the\r\nfaithful” not only in Afghanistan, but in theory\r\nthroughout the Muslim world.\r\nThe process the Pakistani military intelligence\r\nhas chosen for the realization of its objective is to\r\ntransform the Afghan nation into an exhausted,\r\ndevastated, illiterate, ignorant and destitute nation\r\nstruggling hard for mere survival. Pakistan wants to\r\nturn Afghanistan into its false front to mask illicit\r\nactivities of narcotics trafficking, terrorism and other\r\ncrimes, as well as religious extremism, by establishing\r\ncentres and bases for such activities. Attempting to act\r\nas the champion of the Muslim world, Pakistan\r\ncontinues to carry out these activities under the name\r\nof Islam. It is therefore not a matter of astonishment\r\nthat such activities have led to the defamation of both\r\nthe noble religion of Islam and the image of Muslims\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIn short, the Afghan nation has become the direct\r\nvictim of the diabolic dreams of the Pakistani\r\nmilitary’s hegemonic interests in the region. These\r\ndiabolic dreams are pursued by the Pakistani military\r\nintelligence, ISI, an evil and extremist institution,\r\nwhile the implied risk and perilous consequences for\r\nthe very survival of Pakistan as a State in the future are\r\noverlooked.\r\nAs the world is gradually awakening to the\r\ncreeping Taliban threat, it is a matter of dismay that\r\nsome “civilized” nations, on certain occasions, have\r\npreferred to deal with the reclusive and defiant Taliban,\r\nan entity which has failed to meet the minimum\r\nstandard of being considered civilized, while having\r\nchampioned terrorism, human rights violations and\r\ncrimes against humanity. It is no surprise that only\r\nPakistan’s military junta has continuously given its full\r\nblessing to the movement.\r\nAt least until early May of this year, the official\r\nposition of Pakistan, from what its diplomats and\r\nofficials strangely claimed, was that it maintained\r\ncontacts with both parties to the conflict. However,\r\nPakistan’s News Network International (NNI) news\r\nagency reported on 25 May 2000 that General Pervez\r\nMusharraf claimed that Pakistan’s pro-Taliban policy\r\nwas “in accordance with Pakistan’s national interest.”\r\nAdvocating that Pashtoons should be on the side of\r\nPakistan, the General was quoted as saying, “We have a\r\nnational security interest, both demographic and\r\ngeographic.” He further stated that in the realization of\r\nthis security interest, “Pashtoons should be on our side\r\nand they”, meaning Pashtoons, “are represented by\r\nTaliban.”\r\nThe world must know that in a flagrant violation\r\nof recognized international norms and principles and in\r\nclear contempt of the United Nations Charter, the ruler\r\nof the Pakistani military junta, under the outrageous\r\npretext of national security interest, has claimed the\r\nright to impose a certain ethnic group through the\r\ninvocation of an ethnically provocative mandate at the\r\ncost of the sovereignty and political independence of\r\nAfghanistan, a Member of the United Nations and,\r\nprior to that, of the League of Nations, long before\r\nPakistan was even born.\r\nIt is important to remember that terrorist training\r\ncamps operating from the Taliban-held territories of\r\nAfghanistan, including those established by the\r\ninfamous Osama bin Laden, whose dismantling has\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nbeen repeatedly called for by the United Nations and\r\nthe entire international community, have been\r\nestablished by Pakistan’s military intelligence through\r\nthe Taliban mercenaries and other extremist networks.\r\nThey continue to utilize these territories as a ground for\r\ntraining, sheltering, planning and dispatching elements\r\nseeking to commit hostile acts against countries of the\r\nregion and beyond. This is done under the guise of\r\nIslam, but, in fact, it is mainly in pursuit of Pakistani\r\nhegemonistic objectives directed towards Afghanistan\r\nand the Central Asian Republics. Recent events and\r\nactivities by extremist groups in Kyrgyzstan and\r\nUzbekistan are manifest examples of the spillover of\r\nthe Pakistan/Taliban-supported agenda in the region.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan believes it is\r\nhigh time that the Security Council, in accordance with\r\nrelevant resolutions, undertook appropriate\r\nenforcement measures against Pakistan, which is the\r\nprime source of sponsorship of these activities.\r\nThe Security Council, in its unanimously adopted\r\nresolution 1267 of 15 October 1999, explicitly\r\ndemanded that the Taliban mercenaries refrain from\r\nsheltering, supporting and training terrorists and\r\nplanning terrorist acts from Afghan soil against other\r\ncountries and that it extradite to the requesting States\r\nthose indicted for committing international acts of\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe recent upsurge of terrorist activities in\r\nCentral Asian countries and beyond, emanating from\r\nthe Taliban-occupied parts of Afghanistan, requires\r\ndrastic measures by the Security Council against the\r\nmilitia and its Pakistani supporters. The consideration\r\nof the imposition of further targeted sanctions and the\r\nexpansion of the scope of resolution 1267 (1999),\r\nwhich must include the end of terrorist activities in all\r\nforms and manifestations in the Taliban-held parts of\r\nAfghanistan, could adequately, among other things,\r\nserve the cause of peace and security in the region.\r\nHere I would like to welcome the proposal by the\r\nRepublic of Uzbekistan for convening an international\r\nconference, at the earliest possible time, to debate the\r\nevil phenomenon of terrorism.\r\nIn spite of the current devastating drought in\r\nAfghanistan — the most severe in 30 years —\r\nAfghanistan remains the leading producer of narcotics.\r\nThe production of illicit drugs, and their trafficking by\r\nthe Taliban and the politico-military mafia of Pakistan,\r\naccount for considerable revenue, which is used to\r\nfinance the prolonged war in Afghanistan. This leads to\r\nconsiderable transnational organized crime, while\r\nadding to the number of addicts, both at home and\r\nabroad.\r\nAmong the many deliberate violations and\r\ninstances of absolute disregard for international\r\nhumanitarian law and the numerous crimes against\r\nhumanity committed by the Taliban and their outside\r\nsupporters in the year 2000, one could mention the\r\nfollowing cases: the cold-blooded killing on 11 May of\r\n198 young Uzbek and Hazara men imprisoned as\r\nhostages in Taliban jails; the brutal killing on 5 August\r\nof the United Nations mine-clearance employees\r\naffiliated with the Organization for Mine Clearance and\r\nAfghan Rehabilitation; the deliberate denial of access\r\nto humanitarian aid that, according to the European\r\nUnion, in the light of the devastating drought\r\nconstituted a breach of international humanitarian law;\r\nthe forced blood-drawing and organ removal of\r\ninnocent civilians along the Tagab-Nijrab route in\r\nAugust; the forced deportation of the civilian\r\npopulations of the city of Aibak on 31 July 2000; the\r\nclosing down in August, as part of the ongoing four-\r\nyear campaign by the Taliban to keep women from\r\nworking, of all bakeries run by the United Nations\r\nWorld Food Programme in which widows were paid to\r\nmake bread that was then sold at a subsidized price to\r\nother widows, who number at least 25,000 in Kabul\r\nalone; the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of\r\ncivilian neighbourhoods at Taloqan on 15 August; and\r\nthe forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of\r\npeople throughout the north due to renewed Taliban\r\nmilitary onslaughts.\r\nWe believe that the commission of those heinous\r\ncrimes by the Taliban militia was largely attributable to\r\nthe lack of adequate response by the Security Council\r\nand the international community to bring to justice the\r\nperpetrators and others involved in incidents at\r\nBamyan in 1997, at Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamyan in\r\n1998, in the north of Kabul in 1999, and in the killings\r\nof Iranian diplomats, a journalist and the military\r\nadviser to the United Nations Special Mission to\r\nAfghanistan (UNSMA) in 1998.\r\nIt is significant to note that the Taliban continue\r\nto deprive women of their fundamental rights,\r\nincluding the right to education, which affects over\r\n100,000 female students in Kabul alone. Women are\r\nstill barred from employment by the Taliban. While the\r\npredictable results will speak for themselves, present\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nand future female generations of Afghanistan will be\r\nilliterate. The cultural and social impact of that\r\ncriminal act on the country’s future generations will be\r\nenormous.\r\nPakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is a\r\nfact well known to the international community. The\r\nhundreds of Pakistani prisoners captured while fighting\r\nalongside the Taliban and now in the custody of the\r\nGovernment; the mortal remains of hundreds of\r\nPakistanis in the battlefields and the documents and\r\nidentification cards obtained from their pockets; the\r\nintercepted radio transmissions; and the massive\r\nlogistical support and the overt supply of large\r\nquantities of military hardware and ammunition, all\r\nprove the direct involvement of Pakistani army\r\npersonnel in Afghanistan. In fact, Brigadier General\r\nRustam of Pakistan’s armed forces, who is currently\r\nstationed in Afghanistan’s Kunduz province,\r\ncommands the Pakistani-Taliban-bin Laden operations\r\nin the north. He has been assisted by two of bin\r\nLaden’s henchmen, Abu Wara and Hubab. All of them\r\nwere involved in the recent occupation of Taloqan and\r\nin the atrocities committed against the civilian\r\npopulation. It is important to mention that the\r\nNovember/December issue of Foreign Affairs\r\nmagazine has estimated the total number of Pakistanis\r\nhaving fought in Afghanistan since 1994 to be in\r\nexcess of 80,000.\r\nA breakdown of Pakistani nationals fighting in\r\nAfghanistan include the following: Pakistani armed\r\ncontingents, including units from the North-West\r\nFrontier Corps and different commando units, have\r\nactively participated in battles on various occasions;\r\nInter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers involved in the\r\nplanning and command and control of both intelligence\r\noperations and logistical support; ex-commissioned\r\nofficers in charge of tactical operations, artillery\r\nsupport and logistics; frontier militia units;\r\nparamilitary members of extremist terrorist groups\r\naffiliated with the ISI, such as the Sipah-e-Sahaaba, the\r\nSepah-e-Tayeba, the Harakat-ul-Ansar and so on; and\r\nthe so-called volunteers from Pakistani madrassas, or\r\nreligious schools.\r\nOther categories of foreign fighters in\r\nAfghanistan include Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda\r\ngroup and its affiliated units from around the Persian\r\nGulf, the Middle East and Africa, and extremist groups\r\nfrom Central Asia, South Asia and the Far East. In\r\naddition, thousands of Afghan refugees who were\r\neducated and trained in Pakistani religious schools are\r\ndispatched to the battlefronts of Afghanistan. Finally,\r\nthere are conscripted and forcibly recruited persons\r\nfrom around Afghanistan who are deployed as canon\r\nfodder.\r\nIn this context, the Islamic State of Afghanistan\r\nappeals to the Security Council to mandate the United\r\nNations Special Mission to Afghanistan to dispatch an\r\ninvestigation team to Afghanistan to verify and report\r\nto the Security Council on the presence of Pakistani\r\narmed men and Arab fighters who are working\r\nshoulder-to-shoulder with the Taliban mercenaries.\r\nThis would break the silence that has thus far\r\nencouraged further Pakistani intervention in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nI should like to remind the Assembly that only\r\nthose Afghans conscripted and forcibly recruited will\r\nbe immune from prosecution by the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan for war crimes, crimes against humanity\r\nand genocide. The rest shall be subject to indictment.\r\nOne must conclude that the failure of the Jeddah\r\nindirect negotiations in particular, and of other peace\r\ninitiatives at large, derive from the sad reality that\r\npeace has no place in the Taliban agenda.\r\nWhile striving for the realization of noble human\r\nvalues and principles — the institution of a democratic\r\nsystem, the observance of human rights, including\r\nthose of women and girls, civil liberties and\r\nelections — the Islamic State of Afghanistan reiterates\r\nits firm position to strive to reach a peaceful settlement\r\nof the conflict and hereby declares its full readiness for\r\nthe formation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully\r\nrepresentative Government through a workable\r\nmechanism such as the traditional grand assembly, or\r\nloya jirgah, or any other representative forum under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations. Meanwhile, as long as\r\nPakistan continues to directly and massively intervene\r\nin the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the Islamic State\r\nof Afghanistan considers the task of defending the\r\nterritorial integrity, national unity and political\r\nindependence of Afghanistan its immediate priority.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan has high\r\nexpectations that the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community will exert pressure on\r\nPakistan to immediately cease its intervention in\r\nAfghanistan and to withdraw all its military personnel\r\nand armed nationals from Afghanistan; that the\r\nSecurity Council will address the question of foreign\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nintervention, the existence of terrorist networks in\r\nAfghanistan and the effective implementation of\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions; that the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference will clarify its\r\nview of the Taliban’s words and deeds — spoken and\r\ncarried out in the name of Islam — which we believe\r\ndistort, and are contrary to, the true spirit of Islam, its\r\ntenets and injunctions; that the United Nations Drug\r\nControl Programme will assist the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan in the fight against the production and\r\ntrafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations and\r\nthe international community will step up their efforts\r\nfor an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghan\r\nconflict; and that the international community will\r\nprovide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken and\r\ndrought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan. Here I\r\nshould like to mention that the current drought, the\r\nmost severe in 30 years, will have tremendous\r\nhumanitarian repercussions.\r\nWe remain thankful for the statements made by\r\nthe heads of delegation at the Millennium Summit and\r\nin the General Assembly expressing their legitimate\r\nconcerns over the dangers emanating from the\r\nPakistani Taliban-occupied territories of Afghanistan.\r\nWe deeply appreciate and support the\r\nindefatigable efforts of Mr. Francesc Vendrell, the\r\nSecretary-General’s Special Representative for\r\nAfghanistan and head of the United Nations Special\r\nMission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), who has left no\r\nstone unturned, and no party to the conflict or countries\r\nconcerned out of communication, in finding a peaceful\r\nsolution to the Afghan conflict.\r\nI should like to conclude by stating that the\r\nUnited Nations cannot embark on the new millennium\r\nwithout appropriately addressing the issues enshrined\r\nin its Charter, among others, the question of non-\r\ninterference. Neither can this international body\r\nadvocate globalization in its true sense when\r\nTalibanization is threatening regional stability in our\r\npart of the world. Certainly the Pakistani military junta\r\nwill remain the prime actor in this dreadful and\r\nimmense tragedy in Asia.\r\nLike many others afflicted with the Taliban\r\nplague, we wonder how far the evil threat of\r\nTalibanism will spread, how many more souls it will\r\nbury and how many new borders it must cross before\r\nthe conscience of the international community is\r\nawakened, not just to consider but to adopt immediate\r\nand drastic preventive measures.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to\r\nMr. Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Iraq.\r\nMr. Al-Sahaf (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): It is my\r\npleasure to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri on his\r\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the General Assembly, and I should like to convey to\r\nhim our best wishes for a successful accomplishment of\r\nhis tasks. I should also like to express our high esteem\r\nto his predecessor, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\r\nNamibia, who conducted the work of the previous\r\nsession with notable skill.\r\nThe Millennium Summit came to an end just a\r\nfew days ago. From a certain point of view, it was an\r\noccasion for reviewing the state of international\r\nrelations following the collapse of the bipolar\r\ninternational order. We have taken note of the\r\nincreasing number of States complaining of the\r\nunipolar control over international affairs and the\r\nextent of the current and future dangers that this\r\nsituation can give rise to.\r\nMore than 10 years ago, Iraq drew attention to the\r\nfirst signs of many dangers and basic problems that\r\nhave since grown worse and become the focus of a\r\nsignificant part of the discussions of the Millennium\r\nSummit. In February 1990, President Saddam Hussein\r\nwarned against the grave dangers resulting from the\r\nunilateral control assumed by the United States of\r\nAmerica and its headlong rush to impose its hegemony\r\non the world in general and on the Arab Gulf region\r\nand other Arab countries in particular. He also warned\r\nagainst the dangers posed by that State’s recourse to\r\nillegitimate and immoral ways and means of achieving\r\nthat goal, including the use of brute force; the exercise\r\nof pressure; political and economic blackmail;\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States; the\r\nfomenting of racial, religious and sectarian conflicts;\r\nand the use of international institutions to serve the\r\ninterests of American policy.\r\nIraq also drew attention to the following\r\nsituations at an early stage.\r\nThe first was the exploitation by the\r\nindustrialized countries, the United States in particular,\r\nof scientific and technological progress for political\r\npurposes, with a view to engulfing all other countries\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nof the world in a wave of capitalistic globalization,\r\nclaiming that globalization is an inevitable fate to\r\nwhich all must submit, regardless of the negative\r\nconsequences and dangers it entails for the lives of the\r\nvast majority of humankind.\r\nSecondly, it drew attention to the adoption of a\r\ndouble standard as far as political positions are\r\nconcerned, and it noted an indifference to the legal and\r\npolitical standards imposed by internationally binding\r\nagreements, where a balance is struck between rights\r\nand obligations in the process of the coexistence of\r\ninterests among various countries, without any\r\ndistinction or discrimination.\r\nThirdly, it noted the prevalence of the logic of\r\n“power and opportunity” in the exploitation of United\r\nNations mechanisms to ensure the adoption of\r\nresolutions supporting the selfish political aims of one\r\ncountry or a few countries at the expense of common\r\nprinciples in international relations, without first giving\r\nconsideration to obligations undertaken under the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and the principles of\r\njustice and equity — hence the recourse to mandatory\r\nembargoes and comprehensive economic sanctions as a\r\ngoal in and of itself, as well as the continuation of the\r\npolicies of starvation and destruction of the economies\r\nof various countries and societies.\r\nFourthly, it drew attention to the imposition on\r\nthe international community of unilateral policies\r\nthrough mechanisms and arrangements outside the\r\ninternational system, and to the fact that such\r\narrangements were treated as substitutes for the United\r\nNations in those cases where the hegemonic Powers,\r\nheaded by the United States, expected to meet with\r\nstrong opposition by the United Nations to those\r\nunilaterally determined policies, as we saw in the case\r\nof the aggression launched by the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) against the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nFifthly, it noted the phenomenon of the forcible\r\nadjustment and adaptation of established rules of\r\ninternational law to serve the unilateral policies of the\r\nhegemonic Powers, headed by the United States of\r\nAmerica, through the imposition of strange and bizarre\r\ninterpretations of the contents of such rules, or even\r\ntotal disregard for them when said Powers were unable\r\nto impose their strange interpretations thereon. An\r\nexample of this dangerous phenomenon can be found\r\nin the feverish attempts to minimize the importance of\r\nthe principles of State sovereignty, national\r\nindependence and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of States.\r\nSixthly, it noted the phenomenon of evading\r\nresponsibility in cases where the assumption of\r\nresponsibility would not be profitable from an\r\neconomic point of view, as is the case in questions\r\nrelated to environmental pollution, the expansion of the\r\nsphere of poverty in the world and the obstruction of\r\nthe development of the States of the South, all of which\r\nare cases where the responsibility of the advanced\r\nindustrialized countries is quite obvious.\r\nThe dangers, challenges and negative phenomena\r\nto which I have referred, as have many other speakers\r\nin the course of this general debate, have led to broad\r\nreflection on the solutions needed to overcome those\r\ndifficulties and problematic issues. Iraq is of the view\r\nthat the starting point is for United Nations actions to\r\nbe a true expression of the will of all peoples and\r\nnations. That is how the Charter of the United Nations\r\nwas drawn up, in order to establish a system of\r\ncollective security based on common collective\r\ninterests. The stability and effectiveness of the system\r\nof collective security is based on cooperation among\r\npartners and on the basis of specific obligations, not\r\nunilateral action and domination, as is the case today.\r\nThe right of nations and peoples to live in peace and\r\nstability is the essential requirement for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This\r\nright can be guaranteed only if it is firmly linked to the\r\nright to economic and social development and to\r\nfreedom from any kind of pressure or interference.\r\nThis noble collective goal can be achieved only\r\nby upholding the United Nations system and by\r\nreforming and developing that system in order to invest\r\nit with the ability and competence to achieve that goal.\r\nReform is particularly called for in the case of the\r\nSecurity Council, which must respect its obligations\r\ntowards the community of States and must comply with\r\nthe correct interpretation of the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter in the performance of its functions and\r\nthe use of its powers. It is also necessary to restore the\r\nrole of the General Assembly in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, so as to ensure the\r\nnecessary balance if the Security Council fails to\r\nassume its basic responsibilities under the Charter\r\nbecause of the unilateral and abusive exercise of its\r\npowers.\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nThe wave of capitalistic globalization sweeping\r\nover today’s world continues to widen the gap between\r\nthe rich and the poor in the world. This dangerous\r\nphenomenon requires a forceful call to lay the\r\nfoundations of a true international partnership in order\r\nto re-establish economic and social justice at both the\r\ninternational and national levels, upholding the\r\nprinciple of equitable sharing by all of the fruits of\r\nscientific and technological progress, and stopping rich\r\ncountries from using science and technology as tools\r\nfor imposing their policies of exploitation on the\r\ncountries and peoples of the world. A dynamic\r\npartnership between the countries of the North and the\r\ncountries of the South is fundamentally opposed to the\r\nlogic of domination and unilateral power and to the\r\ntransformation of science and technology into political\r\ntools for the subjugation of others. On the other hand,\r\nthe call for democratization within countries will\r\nremain spurious unless its advocates adhere to a\r\ndemocratic course at the level of dealings with other\r\nStates and with international organizations.\r\nFurthermore, the call for respect for international law\r\nand its primacy at the national level will remain devoid\r\nof credibility unless it is associated with the kind of\r\nconduct that calls for respect for the letter and spirit of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the rules of\r\ninternational law, and with the possibility of recourse\r\nto international judiciary bodies, with regard to the\r\ninterpretation and application of legal provisions to\r\nensure a delicate balance between powers and\r\nresponsibilities, rights and obligations. Any affirmation\r\nof respect for human rights should not overlook the\r\nfact that civil, political, economic, social and cultural\r\nrights should, as a matter of equal importance and\r\nurgency, enjoy the same respect. Nor should such an\r\naffirmation overlook the fact that the world is\r\ncharacterized by cultural and civilizational diversity,\r\nand that the cultural and social assumptions tacitly\r\naccepted by a given culture cannot be imposed on other\r\nnations and peoples.\r\nWhat I have just stated does not belong to the\r\nrealm of theory. We in Iraq continue to suffer from the\r\ndomination and abusive actions of the hegemonic\r\npowers headed by the United States of America. Our\r\ndeep faith in the righteousness of our position explains\r\nthe steadfastness shown by our country and our people\r\nin the face of the might of the unipolar Power.\r\nThe comprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq\r\nhave entered their eleventh year. By all standards, these\r\nsanctions amount to genocide and involve a brutal\r\napplication of collective punishment and revenge\r\nagainst an entire people. There is no longer any doubt\r\nthat these sanctions constitute a continued, flagrant\r\nviolation of the United Nations Charter, of\r\ninternational law and of international humanitarian law.\r\nThis matter has been confirmed by the reports of\r\nUnited Nations agencies and humanitarian and human\r\nrights organizations. The most recent testimony to that\r\neffect is to be found in the working paper adopted by\r\nthe Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection\r\nof Human Rights at its fifty-second session, held in\r\nGeneva from 31 July to 25 August 2000. The paper\r\naffirmed that the comprehensive sanctions against Iraq\r\nare unequivocally illegal under existing international\r\nhumanitarian law and human rights laws.\r\nIt is well known that both the United States and\r\nGreat Britain claim that the oil-for-food programme,\r\nagreed to between the United Nations and Iraq,\r\nalleviates the impact of the unjust sanctions imposed\r\nagainst Iraq. Such a claim, however, is quickly proved\r\nto have no basis when set against the figures published\r\nby the United Nations itself. More than three and a half\r\nyears have now passed since the inception of the\r\nprogramme, during which Iraq has exported $31.6\r\nbillion worth of oil. Of this total, $9.5 billion has been\r\nallocated to the Compensation Fund in Geneva and $1\r\nbillion allocated for operational administrative\r\nexpenses of the United Nations while, in the course of\r\nthree and a half years, only $8.3 billion has been\r\ndisbursed for purchases to cover the needs of the Iraqi\r\npeople.\r\nThere are also floating and semi-frozen\r\nallocations for certain needs of Iraq amounting to $10\r\nbillion that have not been disbursed owing to\r\nobstructions placed by the Americans and the British.\r\nSuch egregious obstructions include the suspension of\r\n1173 contracts, valued at more than $2 billion, relating\r\nto construction materials and humanitarian needs.\r\nDespite increasing pressure on the international\r\ncommunity to put an end to this ongoing genocide, two\r\npermanent members of the Security Council — the\r\nUnited States of America and Britain — insist on\r\nperpetuating this crime to further their plans to\r\ndestabilize the Arabian Gulf region and preserve its\r\nhotbeds of tension with a view to prolonging their\r\nhegemony over and military occupation of the region\r\nand to plundering its wealth.\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nThe United States openly declares that it is\r\nprepared to use the veto against any attempt to lift the\r\nsanctions imposed on Iraq. It is indeed shameful for the\r\nUnited States that its Secretary of State, Madeleine\r\nAlbright, has declared on television that the\r\ncontinuation of sanctions is worth the death of 500,000\r\nIraqi children.\r\nJust to clarify the matter, although the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations have authorized the\r\nSecurity Council to act on their behalf provided that it\r\ndo so in accordance with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations, pursuant to Article 24 of the\r\nCharter, the Security Council has, in the case of the\r\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq, gone so far\r\nbeyond the purposes and principles of the Charter as to\r\nturn itself into a cover for perpetrating a policy of\r\ngenocide against an entire people. Therefore, it\r\nbehoves the States Members of the United Nations to\r\nvoice their opinion as to the extent of the Security\r\nCouncil’s faithful compliance with such authorization.\r\nIn this connection, it is worth mentioning that, under\r\nArticle 25 of the Charter, Members of the United\r\nNations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of\r\nthe Security Council in accordance with the Charter.\r\nThis means that implementation of the comprehensive\r\nsanctions imposed on Iraq, which have become illegal\r\nunder international humanitarian law and human rights\r\nlaw, is no longer binding on States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI must also point out that my country is being\r\nsubjected to ongoing daily aggression by American and\r\nBritish aircraft in the no-fly zone imposed on northern\r\nand southern Iraq by unilateral decision of the\r\nWashington and London Governments. The aircraft\r\nlaunching the aggression take off from their bases in\r\nSaudi, Kuwaiti and Turkish territory. This continuous\r\nmilitary action, which violates the integrity and\r\nsovereignty of Iraq’s airspace, has no basis in law or in\r\nany binding resolution adopted by any competent organ\r\nof the United Nations. It constitutes instead an\r\nillegitimate unilateral action undertaken by the United\r\nStates of America and the United Kingdom.\r\nThese belligerent acts constitute both interference\r\nin the internal affairs of Iraq and ongoing military\r\naggression against Iraq through the imposition of the\r\ntwo no-fly zones. The illegal character of the\r\nimposition of those two no-fly zones has been\r\nconfirmed by official statements issued by the Russian\r\nFederation, France and China, which have from the\r\nvery outset declared their position that the imposition\r\nof those zones has no basis in law. This position is also\r\nsupported by a former Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations who, in his book entitled Unvanquished: a\r\nU.S.-U.N. Saga, makes it clear that the American claim\r\nthat Security Council resolution 688 (1991) authorizes\r\nthe launching of attacks against Iraq in order to enforce\r\nthe no-fly zone is baseless and that the enforcement of\r\nthe no-fly zones, far from having been endorsed by the\r\nSecurity Council, is no more than a unilateral act by\r\nthe Governments of Washington and London.\r\nThe American and British acts of aggression have\r\ninflicted enormous material and moral losses on Iraq\r\nand gravely damaged its civilian infrastructure. The\r\nloss of human life to date has amounted to more than\r\n300 martyrs, while more than 900 civilians have been\r\nwounded. The United States of America and Britain\r\nbear responsibility for these acts of aggression and for\r\nall their consequences, in accordance with the rules of\r\nstate responsibility under international law. By the\r\nsame rules, that responsibility is shared by Saudi\r\nArabia, Kuwait and Turkey by virtue of their\r\nparticipation, support and assistance in carrying out\r\nthese acts of aggression. The Saudi Government\r\nprovides American and British aggressors with military\r\nfacilities and the bases of Rafha, Dhahran, Khamis\r\nMushait, Al-Jauf and Tabuk, from which scores of\r\nAmerican and British planes take off to attack Iraq. In\r\nKuwait, the rulers provide services, facilities and\r\nfinancing to the American and British aggressors at the\r\nair bases of Ali Al Salim and Ahmed Al Jaber.\r\nIraq has discharged its obligations under relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Consequently, the logical\r\nresult would be for the embargo imposed on Iraq to be\r\nlifted. Moreover, the Charter requires that the\r\nAmerican-British aggression against Iraq be\r\ncondemned and that its perpetrators and those who\r\nparticipate in it — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey —\r\nbear the international responsibility, with all its legal\r\nimplications.\r\nWe cannot, under any circumstances, deal with an\r\nunjust position that ignores the record of our fulfilment\r\nof our obligations and that denies us our legitimate\r\nright to have the embargo lifted, as required by the\r\nCharter and the correct interpretation of relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. A flagrant example of\r\nhow the record of the fulfilment of our obligations has\r\nbeen flouted and how our right to have the embargo\r\nlifted has been denied is to be found in the\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nunderhanded way by which the United States of\r\nAmerica and Britain have made Security Council\r\nresolution 1284 (1999) a vehicle for defrauding Iraq of\r\nits rights and for misrepresenting its full discharge of\r\nits obligations under relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, including in particular resolution 687\r\n(1991). Resolution 1284 (1999) does not represent a\r\nsolution at all, nor is it, in essence, anything other than\r\na deliberate ploy to further American anti-Iraq policy,\r\nas embodied in the indefinite perpetuation of the\r\nembargo. We have therefore clearly declared that we\r\nshall have nothing to do with that resolution.\r\nThe Middle East region is suffering from a grave\r\nsituation caused by the fact that the Zionist entity that\r\noccupies the Arab Palestinian territories possesses a\r\nhuge arsenal of weapons of mass destruction of all\r\nkinds — nuclear, chemical and biological — and long-\r\nrange ballistic missiles. The Zionist entity occupying\r\nArab Palestine refuses to accede to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and refuses to\r\nplace all its nuclear installations under the\r\ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nBesides being a threat to peace and security in the\r\nMiddle East region and the world, such a position\r\nexposes the double standard applied by the United\r\nStates, which at once arms the Zionist entity and gives\r\nit unlimited support and deliberately ignores the\r\nprovisions of paragraph 14 of Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991). This paragraph specifies that the\r\nmeasures imposed on Iraq should be applied to other\r\ncountries in the region in order to make the Middle\r\nEast a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and of\r\nall systems of delivery of such weapons, as well as to\r\npursue the goal of imposing international prohibitions\r\nagainst chemical weapons. The Security Council has\r\ntaken no action in this regard, despite the fact that Iraq\r\nhas implemented all the required measures.\r\nConsequently, the way in which the Security Council\r\nhas acted under American pressure in this context is a\r\nflagrant example of a double-standard policy.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Marc Nteturuye, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Burundi.\r\nMr. Nteturuye (Burundi) (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of the Burundi delegation and on my own\r\nbehalf, I first congratulate you warmly, Sir, on your\r\nelection to lead the work of the current session. Your\r\nelection is an honour and a sign of the great esteem in\r\nwhich the United Nations family holds you and your\r\ncountry, Finland, which maintains friendly, cooperative\r\nrelations with Burundi.\r\nI would further like to pay a well deserved tribute\r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, who\r\nmasterfully led the work of the previous session. We\r\nparticularly appreciated his competence, dedication and\r\nhigh level of commitment to successfully fulfilling his\r\nmandate.\r\nI also salute the dynamic and innovative work of\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, to achieve\r\npeace, security and development throughout the world.\r\nMy delegation greatly appreciates his report, “We the\r\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century”, which undertakes a painstaking and\r\nuncompromising analysis of the great challenges of\r\nthese times and proposes an approach to overcoming\r\nthem so that it will be possible to live in a world free\r\nfrom want and fear, in a world that meets our\r\naspirations.\r\nFinally, it is my pleasure to welcome warmly\r\nTuvalu as a new Member of our Organization, and at\r\nthe same time to congratulate it on its wise decision to\r\nour ranks at this beginning of the new millennium.\r\nMy delegation unreservedly supports and\r\nendorses the Millennium Declaration, adopted by our\r\nheads of State and Government on 8 September 2000.\r\nWe very much hope that its pertinent\r\nrecommendations, made by almost all the world’s\r\nleaders, will not become a dead letter. The United\r\nNations, and each country in particular, must\r\nimplement the appropriate strategies to translate the\r\nrecommendations into concrete actions that can\r\nimprove the future of our populations and peoples — in\r\nparticular the most disadvantaged.\r\nAt one of the meetings of the Millennium\r\nSummit, which concluded on 8 September 2000, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nBurundi, speaking on behalf of the head of State,\r\nstated:\r\n“The Burundian people are in the process of\r\nturning a page in their history. The agreement on peace\r\nand national reconciliation was signed on 28 August in\r\nArusha, Tanzania, before the eyes of the entire world,\r\nwhich hailed the occasion. This was a qualitative leap\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nforward towards a better future for the Burundian\r\npeople.” (A/55/PV.7)\r\nLater the Minister said, however:\r\n“Everything has not yet been resolved ... the\r\ngreatest remaining challenge is ending the war,\r\nwithout which the implementation of the\r\nagreement is practically impossible.” (ibid.)\r\nThe end to the war was to have been negotiated\r\nyesterday, 20 September, at a meeting scheduled in\r\nNairobi between the Government and the rebels, and\r\nbefore the heads of State of the region. The President\r\nof the Republic himself represented the Government.\r\nThe heads of State of the region and, of course, the\r\nmediator were also there. The three political parties\r\nthat had not signed the 28 August peace agreement\r\nwere also there, and they signed the agreement. Thus\r\nthe maximum number of parties have now accepted\r\nthis agreement.\r\nAs for the rebels, only one movement, the FNL,\r\nwas represented by its leader. The head of the other\r\nmovement — the CNDD-FDD, which is the more\r\nimportant group — did not make the trip. The two\r\nmovements refused to negotiate anything or to meet\r\nwith the Government delegation. Rather, they\r\ncontented themselves with repeating their\r\npreconditions and pleading that they had to consult\r\ntheir rank and file before making any commitments.\r\nThus the meeting was a failure. The hopes of the\r\nBurundi people of seeing the violence come to an end\r\nwere dashed. The implementation of the peace\r\nagreement has been called into question. The\r\nsignatories to the agreement on peace and national\r\nreconciliation — negotiated two years ago — are now\r\naccused of being traitors and men of straw, and are\r\nbeing asked to return to the negotiating table. Those\r\ntaking part in the rebel uprising go so far as to call into\r\nquestion the good faith of the leaders who sponsored\r\nthe negotiations and the signing of the peace\r\nagreement.\r\nBefore denouncing the 28 August peace\r\nagreement, the rebel uprising had hidden itself behind a\r\nseries of preconditions for the ceasefire negotiations.\r\nThe two principal preconditions were as follows.\r\nThe first precondition was the dismantling of the\r\nregroupment camps. This precondition has been\r\nmeaningless since 31 July 2000, because the\r\nGovernment had committed itself to dismantling the\r\ncamps by that date, and it kept this promise, as the\r\nUnited Nations has confirmed on the basis of reports\r\nfrom its agencies working in the field in Burundi. The\r\nfacilitator, Mr. Nelson Mandela, himself publicly\r\nreaffirmed these reports during the signing of the peace\r\nagreement on 28 August.\r\nThe second precondition related to the release of\r\npolitical prisoners — an issue that has been the source\r\nof a great deal of disagreement between the negotiating\r\nparties. But since then, thanks to the compromise that\r\nthe parties have reached, contained in article 15 and\r\npoint 20 of the second protocol to the peace agreement,\r\nthe current Government can create an independent\r\ncommission to look into, inter alia, the issues of prison\r\nconditions and political prisoners.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThat is why it has just asked the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to send to Burundi a team of experts in\r\ncriminal law to inquire freely into the existence or non-\r\nexistence of political prisoners in Burundi. It is no\r\nlonger possible to deal with this question outside of the\r\npeace agreement unless one wants to imperil the entire\r\npeace process. The Government and the people of\r\nBurundi were very grateful for the opportunity they\r\nhad to explain to the Facilitator during his two visits to\r\nBurundi how delicate the problem was.\r\nBurundians suffer enormously from war; they\r\nwant finally to breathe the air of peace. Deadly, wanton\r\nambushes against people travelling on the roads,\r\nattacks on innocent people in the hills and in the\r\ndisplaced persons camps, theft of livestock, destruction\r\nof houses, crops, social infrastructure and so on — all\r\nof this must stop so that, finally, our country can regain\r\nits peace and tranquillity.\r\nSetting conditions to halt violence is cruel, and\r\nthe international community must condemn this\r\nattitude and those responsible for it. Given the\r\nintransigence of the rebels, the Government of Burundi\r\ncalls upon the region and the international community\r\nto implement the provisions of article 2 of the peace\r\nagreement, which states that if the armed groups of the\r\nnon-signatory parties reject the invitation made in the\r\nagreement to suspend hostilities and to start\r\nnegotiations for a ceasefire, the guarantors of the\r\nagreement, particularly the Governments of\r\nneighbouring States, and the international\r\norganizations will take “the necessary steps to stop,\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\ndemobilize, disarm and, where appropriate, arrest,\r\ndetain and repatriate the members of these armed\r\ngroups and, furthermore, take all appropriate steps\r\nagainst any party which encourages and supports such\r\nactivities”.\r\nIn the absence of a ceasefire not only do the\r\ninnocent continue to die, but also the refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons cannot return home; assistance to\r\nrebuild the country cannot begin; and even the\r\ntransitional institutions established cannot function\r\nproperly. Why is the international community silent\r\nwhen two armed movements are holding hostage an\r\nentire people that had pinned so many hopes on the\r\npeace agreement which has now been signed by 19 out\r\nof 19 parties — in other words, all of the negotiators?\r\nThe Government, as it has often repeated, is\r\nprepared to negotiate directly with the rebels and to\r\nconclude the ceasefire agreement as soon as possible. It\r\nwill also continue to explain the peace agreement to the\r\npeople so that they will support its contents and its\r\nprogramme. It is also continuing consultations in order\r\nto arrive at compromise solutions regarding the\r\nreservations expressed by certain parties about the\r\nagreement and other questions that are still pending.\r\nWe would be deluding ourselves if we said that\r\nBurundi will attain peace and security without a\r\nfavourable environment in the subregion and in Africa\r\nin general. Unfortunately, nothing leads one yet to hope\r\nthat peace will be established in the Great Lakes region\r\nany time soon. The Lusaka agreements signed in\r\nAugust 1999 still offer a few glimmers of hope before\r\nactually entering into force. However, they are an\r\nimportant basis for the resolution of the conflict in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The summit that\r\ntook place, again in Lusaka, on 14 and 15 August 2000\r\nunfortunately ended in failure, even though it was one\r\nmore chance to establish the basis for peace. However,\r\na lost opportunity should not discourage us. We would\r\nlike here to say that we very much support President\r\nFrederick Chiluba of the Republic of Zambia for his\r\ntireless efforts to find a solution to the question of the\r\nCongo, and we encourage him to persevere.\r\nContrary to the allegations made by the head of\r\nthe delegation of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo from this rostrum on 16 September, I wish to\r\nreaffirm that the only interest of my country, Burundi,\r\nis to maintain security over our borders. We have no\r\nother ambitions, political or economic, with regard to\r\nany neighbouring country. And we hope that the same\r\napplies to our neighbouring countries, in particular\r\nthose who give refuge to and assist the Burundian\r\nrebels.\r\nEach country, and the subregion in general, must\r\nfocus on problems of development. The ideology of\r\ngenocide, which is undermining the entire Great Lakes\r\nregion, and the many armed rebellions by those who\r\nchampion that ideology, will be overcome only through\r\nthe concerted and determined efforts of all States of the\r\nGreat Lakes region, with the active support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn this context, the conference on peace, security\r\nand development for the Great Lakes countries,\r\nenvisaged for several years now, can be successful only\r\nif each country of the region makes a meaningful effort\r\nto improve their domestic policies.\r\nBy holding the Millennium Summit, the United\r\nNations chose a very opportune moment to discuss the\r\ngreat challenges that await us in the coming century:\r\npeace, security and disarmament, on the one hand, and\r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty, on the\r\nother.\r\nAs is so well summarized by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report, we must live free from fear and\r\nfree from want. Although these two goals are the very\r\nessence of our Organization, it must be stated that,\r\nunfortunately, we are still wide of the mark. Fratricidal\r\nwars continue to break out in various parts of the world\r\nand it takes too long to put the fires out. Conflicts\r\nbreak out on the borders of neighbouring countries, and\r\nentire communities are forced into exile. Given the\r\nmultitude of these conflicts and their complexity, the\r\ninternational community has only a mixed record of\r\nsuccess. Like other heads of delegations that have\r\npreceded me, I am inclined to wonder why our\r\nOrganization does not do better in preventing and\r\nresolving conflicts and in peacekeeping.\r\nOn this subject, we very much support the\r\nimplementation of the valuable recommendations in the\r\nBrahimi report, which was the outcome of an in-depth\r\nstudy at the request of Mr. Kofi Annan on the activities\r\nof the United Nations in the area of peace. We welcome\r\nthe steps already taken by the Secretary-General to\r\nprepare a detailed plan for the implementation of these\r\nrecommendations.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nIf our Organization were to engage in some self-\r\nquestioning, we would probably find that one of the\r\nprimary causes for failure lies in the very functioning\r\nof the United Nations. The Security Council decides on\r\neverything, and it decides too slowly. In the face of\r\nurgent situations, there is too much procrastination due\r\nto political expediency which is very often\r\ninsufficiently understood by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nOver the last fifty years, it is the same people\r\nwho decide the fate of humanity while safeguarding the\r\ninterests of some States as a matter of priority. People\r\nwho seek urgent assistance thus have the impression\r\nthat they are being held hostage or are being abandoned\r\nto their fate because international solidarity, so keenly\r\nawaited, does not materialize. My delegation,\r\ntherefore, reiterates the hope that we will re-think the\r\nfunctioning, composition and attributes of the Security\r\nCouncil in order to revitalize it and to adapt it to this\r\nongoing state of change.\r\nThe question of the equitable representation of all\r\nregions of the world on the Security Council and the\r\nquestion of increasing the number of members, both\r\npermanent and non-permanent, deserve our attention.\r\nThey are in tune with the imperatives of democracy\r\nand legitimacy in making decisions in this highly\r\nimportant Organization — the United Nations. Only\r\nsuch a reform can restore the confidence of all Member\r\nStates in reviving the force of law in international\r\naffairs, because today, weak nations are confronting,\r\nbasically, the law of force.\r\nIn order to do this the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, the Statute of which was\r\nadopted in Rome in 1998, will, I am sure, be a useful\r\ntool to combat impunity.\r\nAlthough sanctions fall exclusively within the\r\ncompetence of the Security Council, from 31 July 1996\r\nuntil January 1999, Burundi lived under a regime of\r\neconomic sanctions imposed by neighbouring\r\ncountries, which was in violation of the United Nations\r\nCharter because it was not an initiative of the Security\r\nCouncil. As has been pointed out, such sanctions have\r\nproved to be both unfair and counterproductive.\r\nBecause of the adverse effects of these sanctions in the\r\neconomic and social area, those who suffer the most\r\nare innocent people — the elderly, women and\r\nchildren. The Security Council should therefore resort\r\nto targeted sanctions only in serious and exceptional\r\ncircumstances when other methods of pressure have\r\nfailed, in order to avoid causing harm to the entire\r\npopulation.\r\nThe other major obstacle to world peace is the\r\nproliferation of light weapons — paradoxically, in poor\r\ncountries. Only with the combined efforts of all States\r\nwill we be able to deal with this phenomenon, because\r\narms manufacturers and merchants form a worldwide\r\nnetwork that represents big financial interests. Any\r\npeacekeeping programme should therefore include, as a\r\nmatter of priority, the monitoring of flows of light\r\narms, since it is such weapons that are used by most\r\nclandestine movements to cause death and destruction\r\nthrough terrorism.\r\nFurthermore, fear cannot be dispelled from the\r\nworld as long as competition to produce weapons of\r\nmass destruction continues. Our Organization should\r\ndo everything it can to bring about complete global\r\ndenuclearization in the medium term. This standing\r\nthreat to humanity undermines all hopes for a world of\r\npeace, to which the founding fathers of our world\r\nOrganization aspired.\r\nThose with the responsibility of governing some\r\nof the poorest countries in the world appreciate, on a\r\ndaily basis, just how hard it is to ensure that peace can\r\nprevail in a community that is bereft of food and other\r\nbasic needs. A proverb in our national language,\r\nKirundi, says, “If you go to sleep with an empty\r\nstomach, you will wake up with a heart full of hatred”.\r\nIt is no secret that the world has an abundance of riches\r\nand resources of all kinds. But that does not prevent\r\npeople in some parts of the world from dying of hunger\r\nor malnutrition, while their fellow human beings in\r\nother parts of the world — and sometimes even in their\r\nown countries and cities — are wallowing in luxury.\r\nThis means that true cooperation is the kind that\r\nencourages growth in production and income to enable\r\npeople to take control of health, education, nutrition\r\nand decent housing. By giving greater assistance to the\r\npoorest countries, the rich countries would be working\r\nnot only for a fairer world but for greater security for\r\ntheir own people.\r\nThe millennium report of the Secretary-General,\r\nsubmitted under agenda item 49 (b) of the fifty-fourth\r\nsession, rightly stresses the seriousness of the tragedy\r\ncaused by the HIV/AIDS pandemic throughout the\r\nworld, focusing particular attention on Africa. Of the\r\n36 million people who are HIV-positive, more than 23\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nmillion are in sub-Saharan African. According to that\r\nreport, in the same region, more than one child in ten\r\nhas lost its mother to AIDS. The very pessimistic\r\nprediction has been made that by 2010 there will be 40\r\nmillion orphans. Burundi has not escaped this\r\ndangerous epidemic, which appeared at the beginning\r\nof the 1980s and is continuing to cause devastation\r\ntoday, particularly among the most active and,\r\ntherefore, the most productive people.\r\nIn the meantime, with the assistance of the World\r\nHealth Organization, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund and other actors, to which we extend our heartfelt\r\nthanks, my Government has launched a robust\r\nprevention policy against HIV/AIDS. A special fund\r\nhas been established to combat this scourge, which\r\ncould decimate entire generations. That is why we\r\nendorse the recommendations of the Secretary-General\r\nto reduce the HIV infection rate, particularly by\r\nincreasing access to information, education and health\r\nservices for people who are already infected. At the\r\nsame time, we recommend that the pharmaceutical\r\nindustry be provided with all the financial support\r\nnecessary to develop an effective and affordable\r\nvaccine to eradicate this scourge by the end of the\r\ncentury.\r\nBefore we can be sure of having built a more\r\nsecure and prosperous world, we must be mindful of\r\nthe need to bequeath to our children an\r\nenvironmentally balanced planet. Unfortunately, we\r\nhave to say that the industrial progress that was\r\nsupposed to have generated prosperity is making our\r\nnatural environment increasingly unhealthy. We must,\r\nas a matter of urgency, control the quality of industrial\r\nproduction and the phenomenon of population growth,\r\nparticularly in urban areas, if we wish to safeguard\r\nquality of life for future generations.\r\nWe have often behaved as if nature would remain\r\nhealthy without our making any effort. Today,\r\ndesertification is a threat to many countries that used to\r\nbe covered with vegetation. Drought has invaded\r\nregions that used to be crossed by great rivers and\r\nstreams. In those places where there is still enough\r\nwater, it takes millions of dollars to treat it to make it\r\npotable.\r\nMy delegation would like to reiterate the\r\nSecretary-General’s appeal to all Member States at the\r\nMillennium Summit to fund an assessment of\r\necosystems before it is too late. The result would no\r\ndoubt be a clear, realistic programme to protect our\r\nenvironment.\r\nDespite the difficult situation in which we have\r\nbeen living for several years, Burundi, in close\r\ncooperation with other Member States, will work\r\nsteadfastly to achieve the goals pursued by our\r\nOrganization. We hope that the United Nations will\r\nadapt to current challenges and to changing\r\ninternational relations for the benefit of all humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hussain Shihab, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Maldives.\r\nMr. Shihab (Maldives): Allow me at the outset to\r\nassociate myself with previous speakers in\r\ncongratulating Mr. Holkeri on his election to preside\r\nover the General Assembly at this historic session. It is\r\na tribute to his distinguished political experience and to\r\nthe invaluable contributions made by his country,\r\nFinland, to the work of our Organization.\r\nI should also like to extend my appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Namibia, for the excellent manner in which\r\nhe discharged his responsibilities during the fifty-\r\nfourth session.\r\nI would also like to pay a special tribute to our\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, for the inspirational\r\nleadership and the moral authority he has brought to\r\nour Organization. His report to the Millennium\r\nSummit, “We the peoples”, will remain a powerful and\r\nluminous beacon as we strive to make the world a more\r\njust and peaceful place for future generations and the\r\nUnited Nations a more effective, efficient and\r\nresponsive Organization in the new millennium.\r\nExactly 35 years ago today, Maldives was\r\nadmitted to the United Nations. We were proud to take\r\na seat in this world body, which has seen steady growth\r\nin its membership, activities and influence. Today, we\r\nare pleased to welcome to our midst the island nation\r\nof Tuvalu. We look forward to working with Tuvalu in\r\nfurthering the cause of small island nations for a more\r\neconomically humane and socially just world that is\r\nenvironmentally sustainable in the future.\r\nWars, hunger and famine have marred much of\r\nthe twentieth century. Terrorism, drugs and the spread\r\nof HIV/AIDS threaten to destroy the peace and\r\nprosperity of our future generations. Economic\r\ninequality and social injustice have tended to increase,\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\ndespite many laudable efforts to the contrary. As\r\ntechnological advances bring untold riches and\r\nopportunities to many, many more continue to live in\r\ndeprivation, their lives becoming increasingly\r\nmarginalized in a fast-changing world.\r\nOnly a few days back, the Millennium Summit\r\nbrought together the largest-ever gathering of world\r\nleaders in human history. It was not only a historic\r\noccasion but also one that rekindled the hopes and\r\naspirations of the world’s peoples. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration adopted at the Summit charts out a future\r\nvision for the world in which “the peoples” have\r\nrightfully been given pride of place in our efforts to\r\nreshape the future of humanity. As my President,\r\nPresident Abdul Gayoom, stated at the Millennium\r\nSummit, “The gap between expectation and result must\r\nbe eliminated” (A/55/PV.3) in the new millennium.\r\nThe leaders of the world have recognized the\r\ndangers posed to the future of humanity. They have\r\npledged themselves to a better world — a world that is\r\nmore just, a world in which every human being can live\r\nin dignity, a world that rejoices in its diversity of races,\r\nreligions and culture. They have pledged to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations so that it may have the resources\r\nand capability to deliver the dreams of “we the\r\npeoples” of the world. It now remains for us to\r\ntranslate these words into deeds, rhetoric to reality.\r\nAction must begin now.\r\nFor over two decades, Maldives has managed to\r\nmake significant economic and social progress. We are\r\nindeed proud of what we have achieved with the\r\nlimited resources at our disposal. A stable political\r\nenvironment, a supportive international community and\r\nthe creativity of our people have combined to help our\r\neconomic growth. However, this does not reduce in any\r\nway the vulnerability of our economy. We continue to\r\nhave a small and narrow economic base comprising\r\nfisheries and tourism, both of which are extremely\r\nsusceptible to external forces that are often beyond our\r\ncontrol. Indeed, the precarious nature of our economy\r\nis readily evidenced whenever the price of tuna plunges\r\nin the international market. Similarly, any downturn in\r\nthe economy of major tourist markets or regional\r\ninstability casts a long shadow on our tourist industry.\r\nWe do not want to wear the least developed\r\ncountry label for ever. As a small but proud nation, we,\r\ntoo, would like to be a self-reliant country. National\r\npride, unfortunately, does not feed our population or\r\neducate our children. It is for these reasons that during\r\nthe Economic and Social Council meeting in July this\r\nyear, Maldives argued against its removal from the list\r\nof least developed countries, which would undoubtedly\r\npull the rug from underneath our feet. Indeed, our\r\nsuccesses in national development to date have been\r\nhighly dependent on the concessional finance and\r\ndevelopmental assistance we have enjoyed as a least\r\ndeveloped country. The withdrawal of access to such\r\nconcessional assistance at this crucial stage of our\r\ndevelopment would seriously cripple our\r\ndevelopmental efforts. Our economy will slide\r\nbackwards if we lose preferential access to markets.\r\nOur debt burden will become unsustainable.\r\nWe take some comfort in the decision made by\r\nthe Economic and Social Council to defer the\r\nconsideration of the recommendation to graduate\r\nMaldives from the list of least developed countries.\r\nThe structural impediments facing our developmental\r\nefforts are so formidable that the country’s graduation\r\nat this stage is not justified. Our geophysical\r\nfragmentation, combined with remoteness from major\r\nmarkets, accentuates our vulnerabilities, many of\r\nwhich are unique. Maldives is not simply an island\r\nnation; it is a nation of islands. In fact, we have over\r\n1,100 small, low-lying islands. Our population is\r\nscattered over 198 islands, each of which needs to be\r\nprovided with adequate administrative and socio-\r\neconomic infrastructure. Poor and porous soil\r\nconditions prohibit most agricultural production, while\r\navenues for economic diversification are extremely\r\nlimited. Transport and communication costs are\r\nprohibitive. That is why we have appealed to the\r\ninternational community to take a closer look at our\r\nsituation and re-examine the issue of our graduation\r\nfrom the list of least developed countries. We hope the\r\ninternational community will understand and support\r\nour cause.\r\nSince the adoption of the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction, the small island developing States have been\r\nwaiting for the international community to meet the\r\npledges made at the Conference on small island\r\ndeveloping States, while their economic and ecological\r\nchallenges have increased manifold. We therefore are\r\nhappy that the world leaders at the Millennium Summit\r\nhave once again highlighted the special needs of small\r\nisland developing States, including the necessity of\r\ndeveloping a vulnerability index that can truly capture\r\nthe unique features of these States. The leaders have\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nalso resolved to implement rapidly and in full the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action and the outcome of the\r\ntwenty-second special session of the General\r\nAssembly. These are welcome developments which we\r\nhope will soon be translated into action by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAllow me to stress the importance of the early\r\ncompletion of the vulnerability index called for by this\r\nAssembly. In developing this index, we believe, the\r\ninternational community should take into account not\r\nonly those factors that are similar among the island\r\nStates but also those that are unique to particular island\r\nStates. For example, while some may be prone to\r\ncyclones and hurricanes, others may be more affected\r\nby beach erosion or coral bleaching.\r\nMaldives has consistently voiced its concerns\r\nover the negative impact of environmental degradation\r\non small island States. We welcomed the adoption of\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol. Unfortunately, the slow pace of its\r\nratification by the international community continues\r\nto endanger many small island developing States. It is\r\nindeed regrettable that to date only 23 countries have\r\nratified the Protocol.\r\nWe are, however, heartened by the fact that the\r\nMillennium Declaration calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to expedite the early ratification of the\r\nKyoto Protocol to ensure its entry into force by the\r\ntenth anniversary of United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development in 2002. We call upon\r\nthe United Nations to take a leading role in making the\r\nrelevant resolve of our leaders at the Summit a reality.\r\nAs the President of the Maldives, speaking at the\r\nMillennium Summit, declared,\r\n“Humanity’s quest for progress must be\r\nsustainable. We have no right to destroy the Earth.\r\nEcological damage must be stopped. Global warming\r\nmust be curbed. All low-lying countries must be\r\nsaved.” (A/55/PV.3)\r\nThe protection and security of small States\r\ncontinue to constitute an issue of critical concern to my\r\ncountry. Among the 189 Members that compose the\r\nUnited Nations today, many are small countries which\r\nrequire protection from a variety of threats to their\r\nsecurity. The Maldives believes that within the sphere\r\nof international peace and security, which has always\r\nremained a high priority on the United Nations agenda,\r\nthe security of small States should continue to receive\r\nspecial consideration as a political and moral\r\nobligation of the international community. The interest\r\nand concern of the United Nations on this issue should\r\nnot be allowed to diminish, even in the future.\r\nGlobalization is today a reality. No country, large\r\nor small, can swim against the tide of globalization and\r\nthe digital revolution that is reshaping the modern\r\nworld. Globalization must benefit all countries. Its\r\ncosts must be shared evenly by all countries. The least\r\ndeveloped countries must be granted duty-free and\r\nquota-free access to the markets of developed countries\r\nfor their exports. They deserve debt relief, including\r\ndebt cancellation, in return for demonstrable\r\ncommitments to poverty reduction. Development\r\nassistance needs to be increased. We remain hopeful\r\nthat the Third United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, to be held next year, will usher\r\nin a new era of development for the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nDuring the course of last year, the United Nations\r\nwas able to record some important achievements. The\r\nfollow-up sessions to the world conferences on women\r\nand on social development reaffirmed the goals of\r\ncreating a more just and tolerant society. Modest but\r\nsignificant progress was achieved by the Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons towards freeing the\r\nworld from the scourge of nuclear arms. Efforts\r\ntowards the establishment of an International Criminal\r\nCourt are moving ahead. A valuable framework for\r\nstrengthening United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nhas been laid out by the Brahimi report (A/55/305).\r\nYet many shortcomings and frustrations continue\r\nto plague the world community. Conflicts based on\r\nethnic arrogance rage on. Poverty persists at a level\r\nthat is morally repugnant. The spread of the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic needs to be urgently addressed. International\r\npeace and security continue to be threatened by\r\nterrorism and drug trafficking cartels operating within\r\nand across borders.\r\nA comprehensive and permanent peace settlement\r\nin the Middle East continues to elude us. This is\r\ndisappointing. We would like to reiterate our full\r\nsupport for the cause of the Palestinian people and to\r\nencourage the sponsors of the peace process in the\r\nMiddle East to continue to pursue their efforts towards\r\nachieving a lasting peace in the region.\r\nThe situation in the Gulf continues to trouble us.\r\nPeace, progress and security in that region can never be\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nachieved unless settlements on all unresolved issues\r\nare complied with fully by all the parties concerned in\r\nconformity with the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions. We would like to reaffirm our unwavering\r\nsupport for the independence, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of Kuwait. As I mentioned before,\r\nwe continue to believe that the United Nations has an\r\nobligation to uphold the security and territorial\r\nintegrity of all Member States, including small States.\r\nThe Maldives firmly believes that the myriad\r\nchallenges facing the world today can be effectively\r\naddressed only in a multilateral framework in which\r\nthe United Nations must play the central role. Despite\r\nthe many shortcomings it may have, the United Nations\r\nremains the only truly universal organization where\r\nglobal issues can be addressed. We believe that an\r\nincreasingly interdependent world calls for a\r\nstrengthened multilateral system with an effective\r\ninternational legal regime that is respected by all\r\nnations. It is with this conviction that the Maldives has\r\nbecome a State party to a number of international\r\nconventions and treaties, including the eight\r\nconventions and treaties to which we became party\r\nduring the Millennium Summit, taking advantage of the\r\nopportunity offered by the Secretary-General.\r\nWe fully support the steps being taken by the\r\nSecretary-General in the process of reforming our\r\nOrganization. While there has been much progress,\r\nmore remains to be done. Reform of the Security\r\nCouncil to reflect the political reality of the modern\r\nworld is essential if the United Nations is to remain a\r\ncredible and effective organization, enjoying the\r\nconfidence of the peoples of the world. Reform of the\r\nUnited Nations must aim at enhancing the legitimacy\r\nof the Organization, making the United Nations more\r\ndemocratic and transparent, and reinforcing the ability\r\nof the United Nations to uphold equality among\r\nnations.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, our leaders\r\nilluminated the way forward. It now remains for us to\r\nmove forward in concert, for the benefit of the peoples\r\nof the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Stanislaus Mudenge.\r\nMr. Mudenge (Zimbabwe): I wish to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland on his\r\nelection to the presidency of this historic session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I also take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate his predecessor, my dear brother and\r\ncolleague, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Foreign Minister\r\nof Namibia, on a job well done.\r\nZimbabwe joins other Members of the Assembly\r\nin welcoming the admission of Tuvalu as the one\r\nhundred and eighty-ninth Member State of the United\r\nNations.\r\nSince a Millennium Assembly can only come\r\nonce in a lifetime, it is my singular honour and\r\npleasure to address this Assembly. The twentieth\r\ncentury was probably the most eventful in the history\r\nand the experience of Zimbabwe. As we enter the\r\ntwenty-first century and the new millennium, the\r\npeople of Zimbabwe, in a very symbolic and yet\r\nhistoric way, find themselves concluding painful\r\nchapters of their experience, whose closure is critical to\r\nthe laying of a foundation for a better future.\r\nStructural inequalities are a fundamental reality\r\nof Africa’s colonial past, which many countries like my\r\nown are grappling with to this day. In my country 70\r\nper cent of Zimbabwe’s best arable land is still\r\ncontrolled by less than 1 per cent of the population —\r\nroughly 4,500 settlers or their descendants. This is in a\r\ncountry of nearly 13 million people. It is a historical\r\nfact that the colonial regime forcefully robbed us of\r\nthis land without paying us any compensation. As I\r\nspeak, the Government of Zimbabwe is in the process\r\nof taking back 5 million of the 12 million hectares of\r\nour prime land to settle landless peasants.\r\nZimbabwe’s land reform programme is meant not\r\nonly to correct the wrongs wrought on our society by\r\ncolonialism, but also to restore our people’s heritage\r\nand basic means of subsistence and economic\r\nparticipation. In this endeavour, we have received\r\nneither the cooperation of those sectors of our society\r\nto which colonialism bequeathed special privileges, nor\r\nthe acknowledgement or support of former colonizers\r\nwho willed those privileges. In pursuit of their policies,\r\nthose powerful interests have employed their financial\r\nmight, as well as their control of the media to not only\r\nchoke our economy but also to demonize us before the\r\nworld.\r\nWe cannot, in one breath, pay lip service to\r\nhuman rights, equality and poverty eradication and, in\r\nthe next, defend inequality, which condemns the\r\nmajority to a life in squalor. We invite all our partners\r\nto see through the veil of the negative and racist media\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nblitz, acquaint themselves with our people’s real need\r\nfor justice, restoration and agrarian reform and help us\r\nremove the barriers that constrain poor people’s ability\r\nto benefit from their economy and to contribute to its\r\ngrowth.\r\nOur determination to undertake land reform in\r\nZimbabwe is one of the “crimes” cited in the so-called\r\nZimbabwe Democracy Act 2000, which was passed by\r\nthe United States Senate in June this year and is before\r\nCongress as I speak. It proposes to prescribe the\r\noutcome of our land reform exercise and seeks to\r\nvirtually usurp the authority of the Parliament of\r\nZimbabwe. Most ironically, the so-called Democracy\r\nAct proposes to authorize the investment of United\r\nStates funds of around Z$ 300 million in the breeding\r\nof opposition parties in Zimbabwe. That amount, which\r\nis exclusively for opposition parties, is more than four\r\ntimes the Z$70 million distributed by the Zimbabwean\r\nfiscus among all political parties that have a stipulated\r\nthreshold representation in Parliament. Are we\r\nexpected to just stand idly by and watch helplessly as\r\nour destiny is determined from outside our country?\r\nWhere, I ask, is our self-determination and our\r\nsovereignty, for which so much blood and so many\r\nlives were sacrificed by our people?\r\nThe measure seeks to hurt Zimbabwe’s fortunes\r\neven further by issuing United States directors at the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank with\r\nstanding directives to vote against Zimbabwe at every\r\nopportunity. This means that even if Zimbabwe met all\r\nmacroeconomic requirements and exercised the\r\nrequisite fiscal discipline it would still be disqualified\r\nin its quest for assistance from the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, on the basis of political considerations that\r\nare totally extraneous to the stipulated technical\r\ncriteria.\r\nJust what are the rules of the game, and to whom\r\nare these international financial institutions\r\naccountable? Do we need any further justification for\r\nthe resounding call for a new international financial\r\narchitecture? For while the current international\r\nfinancial architecture is subservient to the interests of\r\nthe rich and the strong, even to the satisfaction of their\r\nlast extraterritorial exploit, it remains for ever\r\ninsensitive to the survival needs of the small, the weak\r\nand the poor.\r\nZimbabwe’s involvement in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo to help prevent mayhem,\r\nbloodshed and the overthrow of a legitimate\r\nGovernment there is another “crime” cited in the\r\nZimbabwe Democracy Act 2000. At the invitation of\r\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Zimbabwe, together with other allies of the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC),\r\nsent troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\r\nhelp fend off an invasion by two of that country’s\r\nneighbours. The responsive intervention of the SADC\r\nallies effectively contained the situation and\r\nestablished the relative calm and stability prevailing in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo today. It also\r\npaved the way for the peace process that culminated in\r\nthe signing last year of the Lusaka Ceasefire\r\nAgreement, which, all involved agree, offers the best\r\nhope for establishing and maintaining peace in the\r\nregion.\r\nWhat does Zimbabwe get in return for its\r\nsacrifices in upholding the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter? Sanctions and threats of more\r\nsanctions are the response. For helping to create the\r\nvery conditions that enabled the United Nations to set\r\nfoot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nZimbabwe is today questioned, tried and sentenced to\r\npariah status. Some of the proponents of the Zimbabwe\r\nDemocracy Act 2000 have demanded that Zimbabwe\r\nwithdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo before they can even consider withdrawing\r\nthat measure.\r\nAre we being punished for creating conditions\r\nthat enabled the United Nations and other humanitarian\r\nagencies to deliver assistance to Congolese\r\ncommunities? Are we being vilified for enabling\r\nthousands of Congolese children to get polio\r\nvaccinations and other types of life-saving\r\nimmunization? After offering our partnership in the\r\nquest for peace and human well-being, we expect the\r\ninternational community to respond accordingly and\r\ncooperate with us.\r\nInstead of punishing those who invaded the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, instead of\r\ncensuring those who are violating the national\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, in blatant desecration of\r\ncardinal principles of the Charter, instead of\r\nquestioning those who are already in contempt of\r\nSecurity Council orders to withdraw immediately from\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, some members\r\nof the international community have chosen, rather, to\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nvictimize Zimbabwe, whose troops are in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo at the invitation of\r\nthe Government of that country. Exactly what outcome\r\ndoes the international community wish to see in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo?\r\nI reiterate, and categorically so, that Zimbabwe is\r\ncommitted to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and to\r\nSecurity Council resolutions adopted on this question.\r\nIn this regard, Zimbabwe is ready to immediately\r\nwithdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, under the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, as\r\nsoon as the United Nations deploys peacekeepers in\r\nthat country. We therefore urge the Secretary-General\r\nto deploy the observer mission already authorized by\r\nthe Security Council as part of phase two deployment,\r\nso that we can move to phase three and the deployment\r\nof actual peacekeepers in order to enable us to leave\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nLike their neighbours in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, the peace-loving people of Angola are\r\nvictims of an imposed war that has been fomented by\r\ngreed rather than grievance. While the crisis is far from\r\nresolved, we are mollified by the position taken by the\r\nSecurity Council, through the Angola sanctions\r\nCommittee, to ensure the effective application of the\r\nembargo against UNITA. We support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s stance of naming and shaming the violators\r\nof sanctions as a way of preventing the opportunism\r\nand greed that fan conflicts. This was the position\r\nadopted by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at\r\nits last summit, in Lomé, Togo.\r\nIn both the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nand Angola, we challenge the United Nations, and the\r\nSecurity Council in particular, to come to the aid and\r\ndefence of the innocent victims of war, to protect their\r\nnatural heritage and resources from pillage, and to\r\nsafeguard their territorial integrity and national\r\nsovereignty.\r\nWith regard to the Lockerbie affair, we still await\r\nthe Security Council’s comprehensive and final\r\nresponse to Libya’s full compliance with the Council’s\r\nresolutions. It was the Council’s own commitment that\r\nsuch a conclusive step would be taken 90 days after\r\nLibya’s full compliance. We call for transparency and\r\nfairness in the trial itself, at The Hague, to avoid any\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\r\nThe international community must never lose\r\ntrack of the long, drawn-out dialogue on the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East, particularly in Palestine.\r\nWe call for good faith and consistency in the\r\nnegotiations until the brotherly Palestinian people\r\nattain statehood with national sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nIn Western Sahara, the international community\r\nowes it to the Sahrawi people to ensure the early\r\nholding of a free and fair referendum to allow them the\r\npriceless opportunity to determine their destiny.\r\nOn the global economic front, the last decade of\r\nthe twentieth century witnessed tremendous progress in\r\nsome parts of the world, but it also saw stagnation and\r\nsetbacks, even in some countries that had previously\r\nexperienced fast economic growth. Periods of\r\neconomic and financial crisis lead to retrenchment,\r\nwherein concern for people gives way to concern for\r\nbalancing budgets and payments. Those crises have\r\nunderscored the importance of understanding and\r\nstrengthening the social underpinnings of development\r\nto ensure that peoples, their cultures and their societies\r\nare taken into account in the process of development.\r\nPoverty amid plenty is an affront to our common\r\nhumanity. At a time when the world has the\r\nwherewithal to attack poverty vigorously, spectacular\r\naffluence and abject poverty are found side by side. In\r\ncontrast to its potential as the ultimate provider of new\r\nopportunities for growth and development worldwide,\r\nglobalization has been accompanied by widening\r\nincome disparities among, as well as within, countries\r\nand regions. Its ill effects have disproportionately\r\nvictimized the most vulnerable and marginalized\r\nnations and sections of society. Globalization is\r\nredefining the nature and role of States and the\r\ngovernance of international bodies, thereby\r\nsubordinating democratic political processes to\r\nunaccountable economic and financial actors and\r\ninstitutions. Globalization is thus undermining the\r\nability of Governments to serve as guarantors of the\r\nsocial, economic, political and cultural health of our\r\ncommunities.\r\nAt the expense of our common goals and\r\nobjectives for international economic cooperation, we\r\nhave surrendered to blind market forces in the faint\r\nhope that somehow things will, as if by magic, turn out\r\nright. The consequences of that impoverishing process\r\nare clearly visible in a number of alarming trends, such\r\nas the takeover of national assets by transnational\r\ncorporations in the name of public enterprise\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nprivatization and commercialization. As a result, Africa\r\nenters the new century hanging on the vagaries of\r\nglobal markets, accounting for only 1 per cent of global\r\ngross domestic product and about 2 per cent of world\r\ntrade.\r\nGeographically, Africa is probably the world’s\r\nmost fragmented region. The continent is demarcated\r\nby about 165 borders dividing it into 53 countries, 22\r\nof them with less than 5 million people and 11 with\r\nless than 1 million. That fragmentation imposes real\r\nconstraints on development, and, without economic\r\nintegration, Africa will fall farther behind. We\r\ntherefore call upon the international community to\r\nsupport our efforts at regional integration as we\r\npromote regional public assets and initiatives,\r\nincluding regional infrastructure such as roads,\r\nrailways, ports and power-pooling systems, infectious\r\ndisease control, centres of excellence for training,\r\nregional markets and trade, and agricultural research\r\nand early warning systems for drought.\r\nDespite talk of the global village, it is apparent\r\nthat Africa’s lonely days are not yet over. For we still\r\nhave cause and occasion to feel marginalized in so\r\nmany respects. We know what it is like to give passage\r\nto emergency aircraft and sea vessels that criss-cross\r\nour airspace and waterways to attend to emerging\r\ncrises in distant places while our own crises simmer on\r\nand explode in our faces. Our ceasefire agreements and\r\ntruces are tested beyond limit, while the United\r\nNations stands aloof and unimpressed; yet urgent\r\ninterventions are deployed to flashpoints in other\r\nregions, even without ceasefire guarantees.\r\nHesitant and half-spirited interventions by the\r\nSecurity Council in several African conflicts have\r\nneither done the job nor enhanced the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations. As the United Nations organ uniquely\r\nmandated to maintain international peace and security,\r\nthe Security Council should make itself equally\r\nattentive to the needs of the world’s family of nations,\r\nincluding through cooperation with regional\r\narrangements everywhere, as provided for in Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. Or is it true that so\r\nlong as the Security Council remains unreformed, it\r\nwill always fail to respond adequately to the interests\r\nof all the Members of the United Nations?\r\nAs we review the progress of nations and design\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury, we need to remind ourselves that “we the\r\npeoples” of the world constitute the real wealth of the\r\nbrotherhood of nations. The thrust of the United\r\nNations agenda — and, indeed, of development — is\r\ntherefore to create an enabling environment for people\r\nto enjoy long, healthy, peaceful and creative lives.\r\nI wish to put it to this Millennium Assembly that\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury is to champion the agenda of the world’s weak,\r\nthose marginalized and impoverished by globalization,\r\nthose currently circumscribed to the margins of policy\r\nand decision-making in the international economic and\r\nsocio-political system. In brief, it is to protect the weak\r\nand manage the strong.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency The Honourable Janet Bostwick, Attorney\r\nGeneral and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nBahamas.\r\nMs. Bostwick (Bahamas): The Bahamas\r\ndelegation sincerely congratulates Mr. Harri Holkeri on\r\nhis election to the presidency of this Millennium\r\nAssembly and assures him and the members of his\r\nBureau of its full cooperation and support.\r\nI wish also to commend Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of\r\nNamibia, who presided over the fifty-fourth session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe Bahamas delegation also wishes to pay\r\nspecial tribute to the Co-Chairpersons of the\r\nMillennium Summit, Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of\r\nFinland, and Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia. Their combined wisdom and\r\nfocused leadership contributed in no small part to the\r\nsuccess of the Millennium Summit.\r\nThe Bahamas is pleased to welcome Tuvalu as the\r\nnewest Member of this Organization. Tuvalu’s\r\nmembership is a sign of the confidence that the United\r\nNations continues to enjoy among nations of the world\r\nas the best hope for the realization of the aspirations of\r\nall peoples.\r\nWe applaud the Secretary-General’s continuing\r\ncommitment to the United Nations. This was\r\nparticularly demonstrated by his bold proposals for the\r\nreform and revitalization of the Organization, which\r\nculminated in the practical, responsive and visionary\r\nMillennium Summit Declaration. The Declaration was\r\nunanimously adopted by an unprecedented number of\r\nheads of State or Government. In this Millennium\r\nDeclaration, world leaders collectively and succinctly\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\noutlined the labyrinth of issues on the global agenda\r\nfor which solutions are essential in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. It is now our responsibility to implement it in\r\ngood faith. It cannot be business as usual in this United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration placed globalization\r\nhigh on the list of issues requiring urgent attention. As\r\na process offering opportunities for growth and\r\ndevelopment, globalization has never been challenged.\r\nIt is a grim reality, however, that few have profited, and\r\nsome, particularly smaller economies, have become\r\nmarginalized and even more vulnerable.\r\nFor many of the small island developing States of\r\nthe Caribbean, their mainstay industries, particularly\r\nbananas and financial services, have come under\r\nextreme pressure in this rapidly globalizing world.\r\nWith respect to financial services, the Bahamas has\r\nalways cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, with\r\ninternational efforts to combat money laundering.\r\nCurrently we are amending our legislation and\r\nreinforcing our regulatory regime so as to fully comply\r\nwith international best practices.\r\nWhile the Bahamas will move expeditiously to\r\ncorrect deficiencies in our financial services industry,\r\nwe call upon the Financial Action Task Force on\r\nMoney Laundering (FATF) and the other concerned\r\nfinancial agencies established by developed countries\r\nto immediately adopt open and transparent procedures\r\nto recognize when such deficiencies have been\r\ncorrected and to then take the necessary action as a\r\nmatter of priority.\r\nAdditionally, it has been a source of serious\r\nconcern to us in the Bahamas that one group of\r\ncountries, the Organization for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development (OECD), would seek to unilaterally\r\ndetermine what constitutes “harmful tax competition”\r\nin respect to financial services. We urge those countries\r\nto cooperate in resolving these issues on the basis of\r\nconstructive multilateral dialogue, given that the\r\npressures applied in this and other areas not only\r\ndisrupt growth and development, but could well lead to\r\nthe reversal of the gains made in the development\r\nprocess.\r\nThe intensity of protests in Seattle and in\r\nWashington, D.C., have mirrored the frustration of\r\nmany developing countries in a globalization process\r\nwhich appears to be biased towards the rich and\r\npowerful and to widen the gap between haves and\r\nhave-nots. Yet no country can opt out of globalization.\r\nNor can we ignore the challenge its potentially\r\ndevastating consequences present for peace and\r\nsecurity. The United Nations resolve that globalization\r\nmust be fully inclusive and equitable should be\r\nbuttressed with effective action to ensure a vibrant\r\nglobal economic order in which all countries, large and\r\nsmall, developed and developing, mutually benefit.\r\nThe Bahamas is now an observer in the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) and will move purposefully\r\ntowards full membership. We have chosen to take this\r\ncourse of action because we intend to participate fully\r\nin the WTO processes. These processes should, and\r\nmust, make globalization and trade liberalization\r\ninclusive and equitable instruments for development.\r\nWe made this commitment at the highest level at the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nThere is another commitment in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration that is of critical importance to small\r\nisland developing States such as the Bahamas and other\r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community. The\r\nMillennium Declaration reaffirms the United Nations\r\nresolve to address the special needs of the small island\r\ndeveloping States by implementing both the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action and the outcome of the twenty-\r\nsecond special session of the General Assembly on this\r\nplan. It did so in recognition of the vulnerability of\r\ntheir economies to external shocks and their\r\nsusceptibility to climate change, sea level rise and\r\nnatural disasters.\r\nI wish to re-emphasize here that the call in the\r\nBarbados plan is for action. In line with the\r\nMillennium Declaration and their own national efforts,\r\nthe small island developing States now expect action,\r\nthrough initiatives such as global disaster management\r\nstrategies and a vulnerability index. Such initiatives\r\nmust take fully into account the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment and survival of small island developing\r\nStates. For Caribbean Community (CARICOM) small\r\nStates, we also hope to see the development of an\r\nintegrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea\r\nadvanced.\r\nWe would also, in this United Nations, urge our\r\npartners in the developed world not to continue to put\r\nour countries at risk by shipping nuclear and hazardous\r\nwastes through the Caribbean Sea. We reiterate this\r\nappeal in the face of recent evidence that suggests that\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nthe highly professed safety measures touted by the\r\nnuclear-power industry are questionable.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\r\ncommitted themselves to overcoming many seemingly\r\nintractable problems for which effective responses can\r\nonly be of a global nature.\r\nThe world’s drug problem, and the trafficking in\r\nsmall arms and light weapons, are issues for which the\r\nglobal community urgently needs results. While these\r\ntwin evils are, in our view, closely linked, every\r\nindication is that the trafficking in firearms is taking on\r\na life of its own. The introduction of firearms into\r\nordinary, non-drug related criminal activity, and even\r\ndomestic conflict, is perhaps the greatest single threat\r\nto peace and stability in the Bahamas today.\r\nTherefore, the Bahamas looks forward to next\r\nyear\u0027s United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We\r\nare confident that the commitments made in our\r\nMillennium Declaration will motivate us to grasp this\r\nsignificant opportunity for concerted action. We\r\nespecially urge developed countries in which firearms\r\nare manufactured to take the steps necessary to prevent\r\nillicit arms trafficking.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\r\ncommitted themselves to the eradication of poverty,\r\nhunger and disease, and to making the right to\r\ndevelopment a reality for all. This commitment\r\ncompels us to act on several fronts to achieve our\r\nobjectives. We must, for example, reach agreement to\r\nensure the success of the high-level international and\r\nintergovernmental event on financing for development,\r\nto be held in the year 2001.\r\nOur commitment means that we must ensure that\r\ntechnological advances benefit not just the few, but all\r\nof humankind. We must work more assiduously\r\ntowards the elimination of human rights violations,\r\nincluding violence against women and the trafficking\r\nin women and children. We must ensure equal rights\r\nfor men and women, to bring down barriers to\r\ndevelopment. For countries such as the Bahamas,\r\nforced to bear the brunt of sustained illegal migration,\r\nthe United Nations must collectively address not only\r\nthe challenges of migration flows worldwide, but also\r\nthe reprehensible practice of alien-smuggling.\r\nOur commitment means that we must achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nAddressing the unfolding human tragedy of HIV/\r\nAIDS is also an important front on which the\r\nMillennium Declaration charges us to work. The\r\npernicious effect of this disease, particularly on the\r\neconomically productive sectors of society, has had a\r\ndevastating impact on families, communities and\r\nnations globally. However, the major burden that AIDS\r\npresents, particularly for health care systems, has been\r\nmost profoundly felt in developing countries, where it\r\nthreatens to limit and reverse development efforts.\r\nAdequate resources must be provided to confront HIV/\r\nAIDS, particularly in Africa. In this regard, the\r\npharmaceutical industry must be encouraged to play its\r\nnecessary role.\r\nThe Bahamas welcomed the recently convened\r\nconference in Barbados under the auspices of the\r\nWorld Bank, UNAIDS, the Pan American Health\r\nOrganization/World Health Organization (PAHO/\r\nWHO), the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), CARICOM and the Canadian International\r\nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), which brought together\r\nhigh-level Caribbean health, education, economic\r\ndevelopment and labour policy-makers. The Bahamas\r\nis committed to doing its part in addressing this serious\r\nproblem and has offered to host a regional centre to\r\nassist in combating this HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nThe agenda set for the United Nations by world\r\nleaders is a formidable one. Forgive me if I restate the\r\nobvious — the Secretary-General cannot carry out the\r\ncrucial mandates we ourselves have entrusted to him\r\nunless and until he is assured of adequate and\r\npredictable resources on a timely basis. At the same\r\ntime, the quotas on the basis of which the Organization\r\nreceives its resources must be assessed in a fair,\r\ntransparent and equitable manner. Only in this way will\r\nwe be able to give renewed impetus to the vibrant\r\nprocess of administrative and budgetary reform\r\ncurrently under way. By so doing, we will also break\r\nthe cycle of the Organization’s inability to implement\r\nthe mandates that we ourselves have collectively set.\r\nFurthermore, we must arrest the process whereby\r\nmany issues, including some of critical concern to\r\ndeveloping countries, have been moved out of the\r\nambit of this universal Organization into narrower,\r\nspecial interest organizations. These organizations\r\nharmonize and seek the interest of their Member States.\r\nTherefore, the decisions they take can run counter, not\r\nonly to the interest of non-Member States, but also to\r\nthat of global society as a whole.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nAllow me to raise one more serious concern - the\r\nsafety and security of our international civil service,\r\nthe dedicated men and women who are the embodiment\r\nof the United Nations global outreach. In this respect,\r\nwe extend our profound condolences to the families of\r\nthe staff members who lost their lives as a result of the\r\nrecent attack on the United Nations office in West\r\nTimor. We also join other delegations in condemning\r\nthis attack and in urging the Government of Indonesia\r\nto spare no effort in bringing those responsible to\r\njustice. We also extend condolences to the family of\r\nthe United Nations refugee worker killed in an attack\r\nin Guinea. In situations such as these, we must show\r\nthat we can meet the concerns of our peoples and our\r\nworld.\r\nThrough the historic Millennium Declaration,\r\nheads of State and Government reaffirmed their faith in\r\nthe United Nations and its Charter as indispensable\r\nfoundations for a more peaceful, prosperous and just\r\nworld. They also emphasized that the United Nations is\r\nthe pre-eminent global organization and has a central\r\nrole in setting and acting upon the global agenda.\r\nHeads of State and Government equally provided us\r\nwith a concise, focused and realistic blueprint for\r\naction by the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. They have charged the Secretary-General to\r\nkeep a score-card, the results of which will determine\r\nwhether we have been true and honourable custodians\r\nof the United Nations Charter. It is imperative for us to\r\ndemonstrate individually, and through our collective\r\nefforts, that we can leave for succeeding generations\r\nthe kind of world envisioned in our Charter.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Enrique Candioti, Secretary of\r\nState and Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nArgentina.\r\nMr. Candioti (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): In\r\nthis, my first statement, allow me to congratulate Mr.\r\nHolkeri on his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. I believe that this is a timely opportunity to\r\nemphasize the great friendship that unites the\r\nArgentine Republic and Finland.\r\nI also express my gratitude to Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab of Namibia, another country that is a friend to\r\nArgentina, for the constructive way in which he\r\npresided over the Assembly’s work at the last session.\r\nWe also offer a cordial welcome to Tuvalu upon\r\nits entry into the United Nations and extend our\r\nfriendship and cooperation to its people.\r\nThis debate is taking place after a very productive\r\nexchange of opinions at the highest level during the\r\nMillennium Summit, which we hope will mark,\r\ntogether with the final Declaration, the beginning of a\r\nnew era leading to a more equitable world and a more\r\neffective Organization, in accordance with objectives\r\nset out by the Secretary-General in his report entitled\r\n“We the peoples”. For my country, this is also an\r\nopportunity to set out before the General Assembly the\r\nprinciples and objectives of our foreign policy.\r\nThe Government of President Fernando de la\r\nRúa, who took office on 10 December 1999, has\r\ndrafted a foreign policy on the basis of the mandate it\r\nreceived from the Argentine people. This policy aims\r\nat strengthening our integration with neighbouring\r\ncountries, intensifying the hemispheric dialogue and\r\npromoting economic development, social progress, free\r\ntrade and a ban on weapons of mass destruction.\r\nArgentina is determined to participate on the\r\ninternational scene jointly to build a peaceful and\r\nstable world based on the values of representative\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law, the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights, respect for the\r\nenvironment, economic liberalization, social progress,\r\ninternational cooperation and the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, pursuant to the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. Today, as was\r\nstated at the Millennium Summit, these aspirations are\r\nshared by the vast majority of Members of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nOn the basis of its ongoing interests, the\r\nGovernment has set as a priority objective its political\r\nand economic integration with the other States\r\nmembers of the Southern Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR) — Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay —\r\nand associate members Chile and Bolivia. We have\r\nagreed with these countries to consolidate\r\nMERCOSUR by adopting the measures necessary to\r\npromote greater integration on the basis of balance and\r\nequity. We have made significant progress towards the\r\nexpansion of our markets since the signing of the\r\nTreaty of Asunción in 1991. This was the fruit of the\r\ndetermination of the member countries to implement an\r\nopen trade policy in their economic programmes.\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nThe creation of MERCOSUR was a political\r\ndecision transcending the economic sphere.\r\nMERCOSUR provides a political forum within which\r\ntrust, cooperation and the pursuit of full integration in\r\nall areas foster the increasing complementarity and\r\nconvergence of our interests. Bolivia and Chile have\r\nbound themselves to MERCOSUR as associate\r\nmembers in the context of the Free Trade Area and we\r\ntrust that they will become full members in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nAs a consequence of the broadening political and\r\neconomic dimensions of our integration project, we are\r\nalso witnessing the convergence of approaches to\r\ndefence and security in our region. This contributes to\r\na continental perspective based on confidence and\r\ncooperation. We and our neighbours have made\r\nprogress towards the creation of the joint\r\nMERCOSUR, Bolivian and Chilean zone of peace.\r\nArgentina is part of a nuclear-free Latin America\r\nreflecting the peaceful and cooperative security\r\nnecessary to harmonious development.\r\nAt the same time, as a member of the Rio Group,\r\nwhich has now grown to include Costa Rica, the\r\nDominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras and Nicaragua, Argentina has pursued its\r\nhigh-level political consultations and cooperation in\r\norder to maintain peace, strengthen representative\r\ndemocracy and promote sustainable development in the\r\nregion. It is our firm intention that our countries shall\r\nenjoy greater participation in the global economy. At\r\nthe recent summit convened in Brasilia to\r\ncommemorate the 500th anniversary of the discovery\r\nof Brazil, the Presidents of all the South American\r\ncountries reaffirmed the spirit of understanding and\r\nharmony that marks its relations on the basis of these\r\nprinciples and objectives.\r\nThe consolidation of democratic stability in Latin\r\nAmerica continues to be a central policy of the\r\nArgentine Government. We do not interfere in the\r\ndomestic affairs of others and we respect international\r\nlaw. We promote the consolidation of democratic\r\nprocesses on the basis of our deep conviction that free,\r\nregular and transparent elections and a plurality of\r\npolitical parties are essential instruments for affirming\r\nand guaranteeing the institutional nature of democracy.\r\nMy country also reaffirms its commitment to\r\neradicating poverty, inequity and social exclusion and\r\nto ensuring equal opportunity throughout the region.\r\nWe shall continue to pursue our joint action in the\r\nregional and global campaign against drug trafficking,\r\nterrorism, corruption, the illegal trade in arms and\r\norganized crime.\r\nThe Argentine Republic has a natural interest in\r\nthe South Atlantic that is reflected in our participation\r\nin the zone of peace and cooperation of the South\r\nAtlantic, comprised of 21 African and three Latin\r\nAmerican countries. At the fifth ministerial meeting\r\nheld in Buenos Aires in October 1998, a plan of action\r\nwas adopted to implement our shared objectives in the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, economic cooperation,\r\ndevelopment, the conservation of fishery resources, the\r\nfight against drug trafficking and the protection of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nMy country is in favour of free trade in order to\r\nachieve development and the eradication of poverty.\r\nThe Argentine Government believes that protectionism\r\nnot only generates the deflection of trade and the\r\nclosure of markets, but also constitutes a form of\r\ndiscrimination. Argentina urges the entire international\r\ncommunity to commit itself seriously to eliminating\r\ndistortions of trade and will continue to fight for these\r\nobjectives. In this regard, we believe that progress is\r\nbeing made in negotiations on the free trade agreement\r\nof the Americas to create a hemispheric free trade area\r\nby the year 2005.\r\nIn the World Trade Organization, our country has\r\nprovided new impetus to the efforts to launch a new\r\nround to broaden trade liberalization, particularly in\r\nagriculture.\r\nArgentina also continues to support negotiations\r\nto develop political and economic association between\r\nMERCOSUR and the European Union, including, in\r\nthis framework, the gradual liberalization of\r\nagricultural trade and services.\r\nWe are constantly seeking new ways to integrate\r\nourselves with the world. The realities of technological\r\nchange and continual innovation require developing\r\ncountries to adapt to a scheme of international\r\neconomic integration based on a new paradigm of\r\nproduction. The challenge is to ensure the access of the\r\nleast developed countries to this process of constant\r\ntechnological change and innovation. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the international community — in particular\r\nthe United Nations — must cooperate to promote the\r\ntransfer of technology from developed to developing\r\ncountries with sufficient flexibility and breadth so that\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\ntechnological innovations reach those countries with\r\nfewer resources.\r\nIn his report “We the peoples”, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral quite rightly attaches great importance to this\r\ntask. Without the adequate dissemination of and access\r\nto the new technologies of the digital revolution, we\r\nwill see the gap between rich and poor widen.\r\nIndividual States and the international community as a\r\nwhole must therefore find solutions that guarantee\r\ngreater fairness in the use of digital information.\r\nArgentina remains fully committed to the\r\ninternational community’s efforts to protect the\r\nenvironment from the negative impact of human\r\nactivities. In this regard we reaffirm our commitment to\r\nthe principles of sustainable development agreed upon\r\nin 1992 at the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development — principles that were\r\nreflected in the Rio Declaration on the environment\r\nand in Agenda 21. Equally, we would like to stress the\r\nimportance of making adequate preparation — during\r\nthis very fifty-fifth General Assembly — for the\r\nconference to be held in 2002 to review the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21.\r\nMoreover, we feel it is necessary to consolidate\r\nthe international legal regimes in the field of\r\nenvironmental protection. In this context, and bearing\r\nin mind the devastating consequences of atmospheric\r\nwarming on the global ecosystem and on human life,\r\nwe attach special importance to the entry into force, as\r\nsoon as possible, of the Kyoto Protocol to the\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nThe twenty-first century was preceded by a\r\nprolonged strategic and ideological confrontation,\r\nwhich has given way to a moment in history in which\r\nrepresentative democracy, human rights and open\r\neconomies are shared values. At the same time, we are\r\nfacing a more complex world that has yet to engender a\r\nstable international order. The explosion of serious\r\nintra-State conflicts — as we have seen in the Balkans\r\nor in Africa — are signs of the emergence of a new\r\nstage in conflicts — a stage in which, regrettably,\r\nconflicts are based on ethnic, cultural and religious\r\ndifferences.\r\nThe Republic of Argentina aspires to contribute\r\nto achieving multilateral consensus aimed at reducing\r\nand neutralizing risks to peace and at facilitating the\r\ndevelopment of nations. We believe that if this\r\nconsensus were based on greater democratization in\r\ninternational relations this would increase the efficacy\r\nand the functioning of the international system.\r\nSince it is impossible for individual States to face\r\nthese threats alone, it is necessary to adopt cooperative\r\nsecurity policies to eliminate the potential risk of\r\nconflicts and to strengthen the stability and security of\r\nlegal regimes. It is essential that we face in a united\r\nfashion the immediate and underlying causes of\r\nconflicts, which often arise because of the lack of\r\neconomic opportunities and because of social\r\ninequalities.\r\nThe Members of the United Nations face the\r\nchallenge of finding a response to questions raised by\r\nrecent international crises, including the international\r\nhumanitarian crises. My country believes that the\r\nprinciple of non-intervention must be duly respected\r\nbecause it is the pillar underpinning relations between\r\nindependent States. At the same time, we cannot\r\nconceal our concern at the explosion of violence\r\nagainst ethnic, racial or religious minorities.\r\nIn particular we are concerned about the situation\r\nof vulnerable groups, such as refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons, and about the situation of children\r\nin armed conflicts. Consequently we believe that the\r\ninternational community cannot remain indifferent and\r\nmust provide an adequate response to humanitarian\r\ncrises.\r\nWe must emphasize the role that can be played by\r\ninternational tribunals to create awareness that\r\nimpunity will not be tolerated. The International\r\nCriminal Court and the tribunals for Rwanda, the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, which have been\r\ncreated, constitute important instruments of deterrence.\r\nIn addition to the internal reforms that the\r\nSecretary-General has initiated with singular success\r\nwithin his sphere of competence, the United Nations\r\nmust give priority to more democratic consensus-\r\nbuilding in the decision-making processes of the main\r\nand subsidiary organs of the system. This needs to be\r\ndone in a fashion that does not hamper the speed and\r\neffectively with which solutions are found to the daily\r\nproblems facing the Organization.\r\nMaintenance of international peace and security\r\nis a primary responsibility of the Security Council,\r\nwhich must be strengthened. If these responsibilities\r\nare not fully shouldered, no other activity of the United\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nNations can be carried out with any certainty of\r\nsuccess.\r\nSince the inception of multilateral diplomacy,\r\nArgentina has defended the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of States. It is therefore not surprising that our\r\ncountry maintains that the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil must be arrived at via consensus, and this\r\nconsensus must not entail new discrimination,\r\nprivileges or exclusions.\r\nThe vast majority of the international\r\ncommunity — seeking to ensure respect for the values\r\nof democracy and universality — believes that a new\r\nSecurity Council will have to allow for greater\r\nparticipation by all. This cannot be achieved if new\r\npermanent seats — like those established in 1945 —\r\nare established. Reform of the Council must allow all\r\nStates a greater opportunity to participate in the\r\nCouncil, which must not be monopolized by only a few\r\ncountries. For this reason, Argentina supports\r\nexclusively an increase in the number of non-\r\npermanent members and the introduction of restrictions\r\non the right of the veto, without losing sight of the\r\nultimate objective of eliminating it altogether. We\r\nsupport the adoption of rules of procedure that\r\nguarantee transparency and the possibility of the\r\nparticipation of all Member States in this organ.\r\nOur support for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes continues to be a fundamental feature of our\r\nforeign policy. President de la Rúa reiterated the\r\nArgentine commitment to continue participating in\r\npeacekeeping operations established by the Security\r\nCouncil. The most recent conflicts have shown how\r\nimportant efficient training of the forces participating\r\nin these missions is. Experience acquired by Argentina\r\nin 42 years of participating in these missions is\r\nreflected in the creation of the joint Argentine centre\r\nfor training for peacekeeping operations. It has been\r\noperating since 1995, with the participation of\r\npersonnel from other Member States. We also\r\nestablished the centre for training of security forces for\r\nforeign missions. Argentina, which is currently\r\ninvolved in nine peacekeeping operations, places at the\r\ndisposal of the United Nations its military and police\r\ntraining centres. We also support the initiatives to\r\nstrengthen the rapid deployment capacity of the\r\nOrganization, and we would support restructuring\r\nefforts aimed at optimizing the planning and support\r\nfor peacekeeping operations both at Headquarters and\r\nin the field.\r\nMy country was pleased to receive the\r\nconclusions and recommendations recently issued by\r\nthe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and\r\ncontained in the Brahimi report. These provide a\r\nvaluable basis for building international consensus\r\naimed at strengthening the capacity of the Organization\r\nto prevent conflicts and to maintain and re-establish\r\npeace. Argentina, which is part of the Bureau of the\r\nSpecial Committee for Peacekeeping Operations,\r\nsupports the conducting, as soon as possible, of a\r\ndetailed analysis of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe Brahimi report — including its possible financial\r\nimplications — with a view to achieving its early\r\nimplementation.\r\nMy Government is particularly concerned about\r\nthe problems related to the security and protection of\r\nthose who participate in peacekeeping operations and\r\nhumanitarian missions. The personnel of the United\r\nNations and associated personnel, as well as the\r\npersonnel of other agencies that provide humanitarian\r\nassistance, are facing increasingly risks situations, as\r\nwe have seen recently in the tragic events that have\r\noccurred around the world. Consequently, Argentina,\r\nwhich is a party to the 1994 Convention on the Safety\r\nof United Nations and Associated Personnel, has urged\r\nan improvement in the security situation of United\r\nNations personnel via the adoption of practical and\r\nlegal measures, including financial-planning and\r\nimplementation measures for these operations.\r\nIn this context we should also reiterate the duty of\r\nthe international community to provide assistance to\r\nthose countries facing emergency situations, which\r\narise as a result either of natural disasters or of armed\r\nconflicts. In this area a significant role can be played\r\nby the “White Helmets” initiative, which involves the\r\nestablishment of bodies of specialized volunteers\r\norganized by the Members of the United Nations to\r\nprovide humanitarian assistance to peoples who are\r\nvictims of extreme emergencies and also to mitigate the\r\nserious problems that affect these people.\r\nWe should also mention the issue of AIDS which\r\nparticularly affects the poorest areas of the world.\r\nMore than 34 million people suffer from this illness\r\ntoday. The virus has spread dramatically. In particular,\r\nmore than two thirds of the victims are in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. This pandemic is aggravating poverty. The\r\nillness and death of so many workers is draining\r\nalready weakened economies. The impact of this\r\nphenomenon on the future of the affected regions will\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nprobably mean greater marginalization and will\r\nundermine the foundations of stability, security and\r\npeace. The international community and this\r\nOrganization and its specialized agencies must\r\ncontribute urgently all available resources to the fight\r\nagainst this disease.\r\nI would like to refer in particular to the\r\nsovereignty dispute between my country and the\r\nUnited Kingdom regarding the Malvinas, South\r\nGeorgia and South Sandwich Islands as well as the\r\nsurrounding seas.\r\nThe recovery of the full exercise of sovereignty\r\nover this part of our national territory, respecting the\r\ninterests of the inhabitants and international law, is a\r\nprecept enshrined in the Constitution of Argentina.\r\nThis item is on the agenda of the Organization, which\r\nin numerous resolutions has requested the\r\nGovernments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to\r\nrenew negotiations to find a just and definitive solution\r\nto the sovereignty controversy, thus putting an end to a\r\ncolonial situation imposed by force in 1833.\r\nToday, in accordance with that request, Argentina\r\nreiterates once again its complete willingness to renew\r\nbilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to\r\nresolve this question. We reiterate our support for the\r\nmission of good offices with which the General\r\nAssembly charged the Secretary-General to assist the\r\nparties in achieving this objective.\r\nThe world stage in the post-cold-war era is the\r\nscene of ethnic conflicts, civil wars, massive violations\r\nof human rights and fundamental freedoms, illegal\r\ntraffic in arms and other threats. At the same, time we\r\nare seeing the unprecedented spread of representative\r\ndemocracy and economic and technological\r\nmodernization.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, our main task is to reach\r\nagreements that will enable us to face these challenges\r\nand seize these opportunities in the best way possible.\r\nEquipping the United Nations for the challenges\r\nof the new millennium is the great task awaiting us. All\r\nMember States must undertake to fulfil this\r\ncommitment if our efforts are to be crowned with\r\nsuccess. Argentina is committed to this task and will\r\ncontinue making its contribution.\r\nOn 31 December next, my country will end its\r\nterm as a member of the Security Council. During its\r\ntwo-year term, Argentina has done its utmost to\r\ncontribute constructively to decision-making and\r\nconsensus-building on all items on the Council’s\r\nagenda.\r\nOn the basis of our potential and bearing in mind\r\nthe features of the current international situation,\r\nArgentina intends, in the twenty-first century, to\r\ncontinue to play an active part in the consolidation of\r\npeace and international security and in the development\r\nof peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Allan Cruickshank,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Tourism and Information\r\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nMr. Cruickshank (Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines): I take this opportunity to congratulate the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly on his election. I\r\nam confident that his vision and energy will guide this\r\nsession to a successful conclusion.\r\nI also thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who led the\r\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly with\r\ndistinction and efficiency.\r\nI commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the esteemed\r\nSecretary-General of this Organization, for the\r\nthoughtful recommendations which he has put forward\r\nin his report to the Millennium Summit entitled “We\r\nthe peoples: the role of the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century”. His vision and stewardship have\r\nproved to be vital factors in advancing the work and\r\nmission of the United Nations at this critical time in the\r\nhistory of the Organization and the world.\r\nI join the previous speakers in welcoming the\r\nnation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member of\r\nthe United Nations family. Our newest entrant is also\r\nthe smallest Member country of the Organization, with\r\na population of 10,000 and a land area of nine square\r\nmiles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see the\r\nleader of that nation proudly take his place among the\r\nother leaders of the world in what was the largest\r\ngathering of heads of State or Government ever\r\nassembled in one place, the Millennium Summit. There\r\nis a special affinity between the countries of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. We\r\nare among the smallest constituents of the\r\nOrganization. We share similar historical and\r\nconstitutional experiences. We face the same\r\nenvironmental threats. We look forward, with\r\nconfidence, to a future involving the creative\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nutilization of the phenomenal developments in the area\r\nof information technology.\r\nMy country’s Prime Minister, The Right\r\nHonourable Sir James F. Mitchell, joined other leaders\r\nfrom the Caribbean Community, of which he is the\r\ncurrent Chairman, in denouncing the growing\r\ninsensitivity towards and disregard for the interests of\r\nsmall developing countries on the part of the powerful\r\nin today’s world. In his address to the Millennium\r\nSummit the Prime Minister noted that while our\r\nreligious heritage has taught us how to reach across the\r\nboundaries of nations through the very inspirational\r\nguideline, “love your neighbour as yourself”, small and\r\nvulnerable island States such as our own are being\r\nvictimized by the application of international rules\r\ncrafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes,\r\noblivious to the concerns, and consequences for the\r\nwell-being, of others. We are all affected by the\r\nmodalities of the global village which we inhabit,\r\nthrough revolutionary developments in communication\r\ntechnology. Indeed, we have all become neighbours,\r\nand yet the competition among the world’s peoples has\r\nbecome fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead\r\nand widening the gap with poor countries. This gap is\r\nnow related not only to material wealth, but also,\r\nfrighteningly, to the ability of less developed countries\r\nto compete in the accepted medium of communication,\r\nbecause of the existence of an ever-widening digital\r\ndivide.\r\nThe Millennium Summit concluded with the\r\nadoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirming\r\nthe importance of the United Nations and the need to\r\nstrengthen its peacekeeping operations, as well as\r\nmaking commitments to targeted reductions in poverty,\r\nthe levels of inhuman living conditions experienced by\r\nimpoverished nations around the world, the incidence\r\nand spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basic\r\neducation for all children. On the other hand, we are\r\naware that the current world order is rapidly falling out\r\nof step with today’s realities and that there is a pressing\r\nneed for the international community to come together\r\nand address the numerous challenges before us.\r\nWe must acknowledge that efforts to address old\r\nissues, like world poverty and its distribution, as well\r\nas new ones arising from globalization, the rapid\r\ngrowth of information technology and the resulting\r\ndigital divide, the consequences of the environmental\r\ndegradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS and gender\r\nissues, among others, have largely been inadequate.\r\nOur common and daunting task is therefore to ensure\r\nthat this globalized world will be beneficial for all and\r\nnot just for some. More than ever before, there is an\r\nurgent need to foster a consciousness of universal\r\nmoral values in order to deal with present-day\r\nproblems, all of which are assuming an increasingly\r\nglobal dimension. The promotion of peace and human\r\nrights, the settling of armed conflicts, both within and\r\namong States, the protection of immigrants, the\r\nsafeguarding of the environment, the battle against\r\nterrible diseases, the fight against drug and arms\r\ntrafficking, money laundering and economic and\r\npolitical corruption are issues which no nation,\r\nregardless of how wealthy or powerful, can\r\nsuccessfully address alone. They concern the entire\r\nhuman community and must be addressed and resolved\r\nthrough common universal efforts.\r\nMy country, a small State in the Caribbean, has\r\nalways been aware of its interdependence with other\r\ncountries for its prosperity and security. We have\r\nmoved to advance our interests through multilateral\r\ncooperation in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean\r\nStates (OECS), CARICOM, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates (ACS), the Commonwealth and the institutions\r\nof the United Nations system. For a small developing\r\ncountry like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nmultilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part of\r\nour policies and programmes to enhance our standard\r\nof living and create a better life for all of our people. I\r\ntherefore reiterate my country’s commitment to and\r\nsupport for the work of the United Nations and its\r\nagencies in this regard.\r\nThe Millennium Summit provided an appropriate\r\nopportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicate\r\nthemselves to the attempt to have an impact on and\r\nchange for the better the quality of life of the world’s\r\npoorest people, who are trapped in a vicious cycle of\r\ndeprivation and suffering. The Summit will have\r\nproved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a high-\r\nprofile event to make the transition to a new\r\nmillennium, but as an event that made the transition\r\nfrom words to deeds. The times demand nothing less.\r\nThe security, welfare and development of people\r\nmust, in the context of any new world order, dominate\r\nthe attention of the world’s multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions, as well as of the United Nations. We must\r\nundertake sustained and concerted efforts to free our\r\npeople from poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease.\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nWhile micro-credit and other poverty-alleviation\r\nprogrammes have been successful, much needs to be\r\ndone to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty, millions\r\nstill suffer from hunger.\r\nWe had curbed old diseases like malaria, cholera\r\nand tuberculosis, but they have reappeared in new and\r\ndrug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS\r\nare spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of the\r\nCaribbean Community have placed combating this\r\npandemic at the top of the regional agenda. This\r\nscourge has already claimed the lives of over 10\r\nmillion people. It is projected to claim the lives of over\r\n200 million by the year 2010, the majority of them in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa.\r\nThe developed world is not spared, either.\r\nWorldwide figures indicate that 34 million people are\r\nliving with the disease, over 18 million have died since\r\nthe beginning of the epidemic and over 13 million\r\nchildren have become orphaned. In the Caribbean\r\nregion, the disease now threatens the human resource\r\ndevelopment efforts of CARICOM and could reverse\r\nthe social and economic gains of the countries in that\r\nsubregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbean\r\nis estimated at 172 cases per 100,000 people, the\r\nhighest rate of prevalence in the Americas, and second,\r\nin terms of the growth rate, to sub-Saharan Africa. A\r\nUnited Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over\r\n360,000 adults and children in our region were living\r\nwith the disease. There is no immunity. International\r\ncooperation in the medical, ethical and legal fields\r\nmust be intensified if the disease is to be contained.\r\nWe cannot preach about human rights and the\r\nuniversality of the United Nations while at the same\r\ntime ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people\r\nin the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of\r\nthe Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that\r\nthe time has come when serious consideration should\r\nbe given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In\r\nthis regard, my Government is urging that the subject\r\nbe placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We urge every Member State of this\r\nnoble Organization to give its full support to this\r\nworthy initiative for a country whose democratic\r\ncredentials cannot be challenged.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the\r\nprogress made in the Middle East peace process thus\r\nfar, and expresses the hope that through dialogue,\r\ncompromise and goodwill, the dream of lasting peace\r\nmay become a reality.\r\nIf countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nare to survive globalization, the international\r\ncommunity must give careful and urgent consideration\r\nto the following measures: the revitalization of growth\r\nin developed countries; the lowering of interest rates;\r\naccess to the world’s markets for the products of\r\ndeveloping countries; the reduction of debt and the\r\ndebt-service burden; the reversal of the deteriorating\r\nsituation in the marketing arrangements for primary\r\nproducts produced in the developing countries;\r\neconomic diversification; increasing the levels of\r\nofficial development assistance and humanitarian aid;\r\nreductions in net capital flows from bilateral and\r\nmultilateral sources; and combating the negative\r\nconsequences of the graduation of some countries like\r\nours, by international financial institutions, from\r\nconcessionary funding arrangements.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the\r\nconcerns of other developing countries with regard to\r\nthe general decline in official development assistance\r\nand the flow of foreign direct investment to developing\r\ncountries. We look forward to the consultation on\r\nfinancing for development planned for 2001.\r\nThe changing world environment dictates the\r\nneed for the revitalization and restructuring of the\r\nvarious organs of the United Nations organizations, but\r\nmy Government attaches very high priority to the\r\nrevitalization and strengthening of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in promoting international cooperation\r\nfor sound development, including economic\r\ndevelopment. We share the view that the United\r\nNations should be encouraged to develop its full\r\npotential in the area of international economic\r\ncooperation and should be endowed with the requisite\r\nresources to contribute to solving the serious economic\r\nand social problems facing developing countries in\r\ntheir efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe commend those donor countries that have\r\nmade financial contributions to the South Pacific\r\nApplied Geoscience Commission to assist the\r\ndevelopment of an environmental vulnerability index,\r\nand call for the early adoption by the international\r\ncommunity of a vulnerability index that would serve as\r\na guide for multilateral financial institutions and the\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nUnited Nations on the specific vulnerabilities of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other\r\nsmall island developing States in the strategically\r\nlocated Caribbean, continues to be plagued by the\r\nendemic problems of the production, trafficking and\r\nconsumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances. This modern day scourge continues to pose\r\nserious problems which threaten to destroy the social\r\nand moral fabric of our communities. My Government\r\nis fully committed to the ongoing process of\r\ncooperation with other countries to counter these\r\nillegal activities. In this regard, I wish to reiterate in\r\nthis forum our complete support for the Multilateral\r\nEvaluation Mechanism (MEM), developed by the\r\nmember countries of the Organization of American\r\nStates (OAS) to monitor countries’ cooperation in the\r\ninternational fight against the drug trade. I also take\r\nthis opportunity to urge that more resources be\r\nallocated through collaborative efforts by the\r\ninternational community to encourage farmers to keep\r\naway from the production of illicit crops.\r\nIn his address to the Millennium Summit, the\r\nChairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\nspoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of good\r\ngovernance and respect for human rights and\r\ndemocracy in the entire Caribbean region. These are\r\naspects of our society of which we are eternally proud.\r\nRecently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, our\r\nconstitutional democracy was put to the test through\r\nopen expressions of dissent, but withstood the ordeal\r\nthrough dialogue and compromise. My Government is\r\npleased to put on record its appreciation to the\r\nVincentian people for upholding democratic values and\r\nrespecting the supremacy of the constitution and the\r\nrule of law as fundamental principles by which our\r\nbeloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish to\r\nexpress gratitude to CARICOM, to the Organization of\r\nEastern Caribbean States (OECS), to the churches, to\r\nthe National Youth Council, to the Chamber of Industry\r\nand Commerce, to the Employers’ Federation and to\r\nmany individuals and other institutions for their\r\ninvaluable contributions in bringing about a swift\r\nresolution of the matter. My Government has long\r\nrecognized the urgent need for constitutional reform\r\nand will continue to work with other interested parties\r\nto bring about meaningful change that would seek,\r\namong other things, to strengthen the foundations of\r\nour democracy. As full members of this body, we have\r\nseen, at close quarters, the importance of constitutional\r\nreform in the promotion of democracy, stability and\r\neconomic development.\r\nWe also recognize that constitutional reform is\r\ncrucial to strengthening our own integration processes\r\nwithin the Caribbean Community, including the\r\nestablishment of a Caribbean court of justice, to be,\r\ninter alia, the authoritative body adjudicating on\r\nmatters pertaining to the interpretation and\r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Treaty of\r\nChaguaramas, which established CARICOM.\r\nMany matters of profound importance to Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity as a whole are included in the agenda of\r\nthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These\r\ninclude: sustainable development, the future of United\r\nNations reform, the International Criminal Court and\r\nhuman rights, the death penalty and financing for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI wish, once again, to focus the attention of this\r\nnoble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean banana\r\ntrade with the European Union (EU). The facts are well\r\ndocumented. Banana exports to the European Union\r\nfrom my country and similarly from Dominica, Saint\r\nLucia and other African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)\r\ncountries are crucial to the economies of these\r\ncountries and represent over half of all export earnings\r\nin some cases. The industry provides substantial\r\nemployment for many families in Dominica, Saint\r\nLucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my own\r\ncountry.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciative\r\nof the efforts of the European Commission and other\r\nparties which seek to bring about an amicable and\r\nequitable solution to the dispute. However we are\r\ndeeply concerned that, should the tariff quota regime\r\nbe eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity with\r\nthe 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, this\r\nwould have immeasurable harmful consequences for\r\nour economy. It will lead to the destruction of the\r\nCaribbean banana industry and negatively affect other\r\nACP supplying States where exports are also crucial to\r\nthe economy.\r\nThe two alternative solutions being proposed by\r\nthe European Commission, that is a first come, first\r\nserved system, along with a tariff rate quota and, if that\r\nproves impracticable, moving directly to a tariff only\r\nsystem, would prove to be disadvantageous and\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\ndisastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither system\r\nensures access.\r\nWe therefore urge the interested parties to the\r\ndispute to use their substantial influence to bring about\r\nthe much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate a\r\nresolution that is acceptable to all parties. An\r\nefficacious settlement of this long-standing issue will\r\nsupport our efforts, as a small economically vulnerable\r\nisland State, in eradicating poverty and maintaining\r\npeace and economic security, which are vital for the\r\nachievement of economic diversification within a\r\nreasonable period of transition.\r\nWhile we recognize that there are structural and\r\ninherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability to\r\ncompete with highly integrated operations on the\r\nmarket, we ask that an equitable solution be sought in\r\norder to allow our people to engage meaningfully in\r\ntrade and development, rather than be forever subjected\r\nto the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expressed\r\ndesire to hold on to our banana industry, which served\r\nus well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the\r\nrealities of the present day trade and economic\r\nenvironment.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to express its concern\r\nover the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva within\r\nthe WTO that would prevent consideration of the\r\nwaiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EU\r\nPartnership Agreement if it includes bananas without\r\nadvice on how the regime will be formed. My country\r\nand other members of the Caribbean Community have\r\nbeen actively engaged in diversifying our economies\r\nthroughout the last quarter of the last century. This has\r\ninvolved activities in the agricultural, manufacturing,\r\ntourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, as a direct corollary of this thrust, we have\r\nimproved air access to our country and my Government\r\ncontinues to prioritize the education of our people to\r\nprepare them for the opportunities that will accrue.\r\nMy Government will continue to honour its\r\ncommitments to all international agreements to which\r\nit is signatory. In furtherance to our international\r\nobligation we have signed the following: the United\r\nNations Convention on Contracts for the International\r\nSale of Goods, the Convention on the Recognition and\r\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United\r\nNations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea,\r\nthe International Convention Against the Taking of\r\nHostages and the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected\r\nPersons, including Diplomatic Agents. All of these\r\ninstruments were deposited with the Secretary General\r\nduring the Millennium Summit.\r\nDuring his speech at the Millennium Summit,\r\nPrime Minister Mitchell stated that:\r\n“Small island States such as our own, with\r\nan enviable record of good governance and\r\nhuman rights, have seen the mighty in the banana\r\ntrade using the international rules — crafted by\r\nthem — impede our economic growth.”\r\nSimilarly, the verdicts that have been imposed by\r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) on our financial services,\r\nwithout any deference to our rights to be heard,\r\ndemonstrate total disregard for the well-being of small\r\nvulnerable States attempting to diversify their\r\neconomies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell’s sentiment,\r\n“Where is the fairness in free trade?”\r\nOffshore financial services is one of our chosen\r\navenues of economic diversification. We believe that\r\nwe are capable of offering a useful, professional and\r\nmutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly,\r\nin 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislative\r\nexercise to ensure that we would put in place a\r\nregulatory and supervisory framework to adequately\r\nadminister the conduct of international financial\r\nbusinesses operating in Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen our\r\nregulatory regime against money laundering activities,\r\nwe enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to being\r\na responsible member of the international community,\r\nincluding by playing its part in the war against money\r\nlaundering. We believe that those who toil to build a\r\nbetter life for themselves, their children, their\r\ngrandchildren and any other beneficiaries, should be\r\nafforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Such\r\npeople should have access to facilities that will\r\npreserve that privacy, and the opportunity should be\r\ncreated for them to optimize and maximize their\r\nwealth. It is, however, important to note that whilst we\r\nbelieve in the preservation of privacy, we are also\r\nresolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirable\r\ncharacter and conduct are not allowed to take\r\nadvantage of the opportunities that are available in our\r\ninternational finance sector.\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nMy country and others in the Caribbean\r\nCommunity are deeply concerned that the so-called\r\nharmful tax initiative of the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) is designed to\r\nfrustrate tax competition, and that it threatens the\r\nsovereignty of small island States desperately seeking\r\ncreative avenues for survival. Such action on the part\r\nof the OECD could encourage the creation of a tax\r\ncartel, thereby removing the possibility of lower taxes\r\nfrom those who wish to legitimately escape them\r\nthrough the exercise of free choice. It would also close\r\noff an area of diversification and economic activity in\r\nwhich poor developing countries can be competitive\r\nand which they have actively promoted for a long time.\r\nThe unilateral practices of the OECD, the Financial\r\nStability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force\r\nalso impact negatively on the burden of taxation in\r\nwealthy countries, impair the competitive capacity of\r\nCaribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a global\r\nfinancial service and stifle economic growth in the 47\r\nblacklisted countries, with all the concomitant evils.\r\nThe small island States of the Caribbean are\r\namong those countries most at risk from the adverse\r\neffects of climate change. Already, many of our islands\r\nare experiencing those effects in areas that impact\r\ndirectly on the important tourism sector of our\r\neconomies. We are also prone to extremely damaging\r\nnatural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm\r\nsurges, which visit us annually with increasing\r\nfrequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also\r\nexperiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions\r\nand earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if\r\nless regularly than the pleasantly named perennials.\r\nThe continued committed support of the international\r\ncommunity is crucial in complementing the work of\r\nthose States in addressing these serious problems.\r\nOur survival as a region is intimately interwoven\r\nwith our environment. Our physical and economic\r\nlimitations should not be further burdened by the trans-\r\nshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways.\r\nSuch actions are a flagrant violation of our human\r\nrights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. We\r\ntherefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be a\r\nnuclear-free zone in the context of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn closing, I take this opportunity to pay tribute in\r\nthis forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, through service to\r\nour country, to the Caribbean and to the international\r\ncommunity. I speak of the Prime Minister of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman of\r\nthe Caribbean Community, The Right Honourable\r\nSir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as an\r\nelected member of our legislature. He has seen our\r\ncountry through the stages of constitutional\r\ndevelopment from crown colony to internal self-\r\ngovernment, and finally, as our longest serving Prime\r\nMinister, to a fully independent State. For us in Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines, it is difficult to\r\ncontemplate public life without him. His address at the\r\nMillennium Summit was his last to this body, for he\r\nhas decided to demit office as Prime Minister before\r\nthe twenty-first anniversary of our political\r\nindependence, on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchell\r\nhas made us all proud by his long, dedicated and\r\nvisionary service. The initiatives taken by him in the\r\narea of land reform, which empowered people through\r\nland ownership, are exemplary. I think it is appropriate\r\nthat, on behalf of Vincentians everywhere, I extend\r\nsincere gratitude to him from this rostrum.\r\nThe challenge is ours: to turn our words into\r\naction and to agree on a common vision of our future.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nChairman of the delegation of Niger, His Excellency\r\nMr. Ousmane Moutari.\r\nMr. Moutari (Niger) (spoke in French): I wish at\r\nthe very outset to convey to the countries and\r\ninstitutions represented here a message of sincere\r\nfriendship from the people of Niger along with its\r\nfervent wish to maintain and continue to strengthen the\r\nlinks of peaceful coexistence and of fruitful and\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation with all the other\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nMy warm welcome and hearty congratulations go\r\nto Tuvalu, the latest country to join the United Nations\r\nfamily.\r\nWith the 24 November 1999 presidential\r\nelections and the 31 December 1999 legislative\r\nelections, our people emerged from a period of political\r\ninstability and economic decline with every confidence\r\nin the resiliency of the democratic institutions\r\nestablished by our 18 July 1999 constitution, and with\r\nstrengthened determination to ensure that the universal\r\nideals of peace, freedom, justice and equity will prevail\r\nin Niger, throughout Africa, and everywhere in the\r\nworld.\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nWe are participating in this great gathering at the\r\nbeginning of the twenty-first century, proud of being\r\namong the democratic nations and committed, at home\r\nand internationally, to the establishment of institutional\r\nand legal provisions based on free and equal\r\nparticipation by all, on transparency, on responsibility\r\nand on solidarity.\r\nToday’s Niger is experiencing the same freeing of\r\ncreative forces that results from the triumph of\r\nfreedom, and the same upsurge in individual and\r\ncollective initiative that is today being generated in\r\ndemocratic societies everywhere. We are no less\r\noptimistic about the inevitable triumph of the universal\r\nvalues of which the General Assembly is the shrine.\r\nBut we also feel the same wrenching pain over the\r\nuncertain future caused by the persistence of conflicts\r\nand the destitution of the vast majority who are crushed\r\nbeneath the burden of debt, endemic diseases, illiteracy\r\nand, above all, the troubling inadequacies of the\r\nremedies prescribed to deal effectively with the ills\r\nafflicting humankind.\r\nHence our even more profound attachment to the\r\nprinciples and ideals of the Charter and our full\r\nconviction that the United Nations, which is at risk of\r\nbeing out of step with current developments towards\r\nincreasingly participatory management of our common\r\npublic resources, will undertake the necessary reforms\r\nto make its institutions and organs more responsive to\r\nthe aspirations of the people they are supposed to\r\nrepresent.\r\nRefashioning the Organization to match the new\r\ncentury that is beginning, to make it a real instrument\r\nof change and to renew our hope goes far beyond\r\nsimply restructuring its main bodies, subsidiary bodies\r\nand specialized agencies. We must also strive\r\nvigorously to open up the entire system to increasingly\r\nactive partners, such as Parliaments, governmental\r\nregional organizations, non-governmental organizations,\r\norganizations of civil society, the media and the private\r\nsector, without ever losing sight of the primary\r\nvocation of the United Nations as an expression of the\r\nnational will of Member States. This would greatly\r\nincrease the international community’s capacity for\r\naction in such varied areas as peace and international\r\nsecurity, the fight against pandemics, especially\r\nHIV/AIDS, poverty eradication, the resolution of the\r\nquestion of debt and, generally speaking, the promotion\r\nof sustainable development in the world.\r\nFor many countries represented here the primary\r\nongoing source of anguish comes from the absence of\r\nbasic physical security for citizens who are victims of\r\narmed conflict, and the unacceptable proliferation of\r\nlight weapons and small arms, which States that are\r\nunstable and economically drained have difficulty\r\nhalting. Other forums, including the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, have pointed out ways of resolving the\r\nconflicts in Sierra Leone, Angola and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, in close cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, the recent failure\r\nof the Camp David process should further strengthen\r\nour determination in the tireless search for a just and\r\nlasting peace that can restore the inalienable rights of\r\nthe Palestinian people, including their right to an\r\nindependent State, and ensure the return of the Golan\r\nHeights to Syria. In Western Sahara, it is time that the\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions were implemented\r\nfor the self-determination of the Sahrawi people. In\r\naddition, the Iraqi people continue to be victims of an\r\nembargo that chiefly affects the most vulnerable\r\nsectors of society, including women and children. It is\r\nhigh time that the international community took the\r\nnecessary measures to alleviate the pain of the Iraqi\r\npeople.\r\nWith regard to small arms and light weapons,\r\nwhich are one of the major challenges facing the\r\ninternational community, my Government feels that\r\nconcrete and sustained measures should be taken at\r\nthree levels — national, regional and worldwide — to\r\ncombat the illicit trade, proliferation and use of this\r\ntype of weapon. In this regard, my Government is\r\npleased that a United Nations mission recently visited\r\nthe Niger in order to evaluate in the field the relevance\r\nof the request for financing submitted by my\r\nGovernment.\r\nIt is a pleasure for me to warmly thank the\r\nGovernments of all interested States, particularly of\r\nFrance, Germany, Japan and Norway, for their financial\r\ncontributions to the United Nations fund to assist\r\nStates in the collection of small arms, which made that\r\nmission possible.\r\nA draft submitted by my country forms part of the\r\nsubregional and regional initiatives aimed at halting the\r\nillicit traffic in small arms and light weapons, such as\r\nthe Moratorium adopted on 30 October 1998 by the\r\nConference of Heads of State and Government of the\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\r\nintegrated project on security and development called\r\nProgramme for Coordination and Assistance for\r\nSecurity and Development.\r\nThe handover, on 5 June, of weapons held by\r\nvarious groups of the former rebellion and the lighting\r\non 25 September 2000 of a flame of peace at Agadez,\r\nNiger, create hope for a return to calm for the people of\r\nthe Niger and the full implementation of projects\r\ndesigned with the welcome assistance of bilateral and\r\nmultilateral partners of the Niger. In this regard, the\r\nconvening of the United Nations Conference on the\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects next year bodes well. For the Niger the goal\r\nof that Conference should be to develop and strengthen\r\ninternational, regional and national efforts to prevent,\r\ncombat, limit and eradicate illicit traffic in small arms\r\nand light weapons through strengthening national\r\ncapacities in the areas of customs, police, justice and\r\ninformation.\r\nNever before has humankind had such wealth and\r\nso much potential to create common well-being. Yet\r\ntoday more than half of the world population still lives\r\nin destitution, excluded from the benefits of\r\nglobalization and of the digital revolution. We can\r\ncertainly welcome the unanimous will expressed by the\r\ninternational community to reduce poverty by half by\r\n2015. But we need to go beyond statements of faith to\r\nestablish a real international development strategy\r\nfirmly based on the eradication of absolute poverty and\r\non reviving growth in the developing world, and\r\nparticularly in Africa, the most vulnerable region.\r\nThe treatment of the question of the external debt\r\nof poor countries is one of the best barometers by\r\nwhich we can measure the real degree of the\r\ninternational community’s commitment in the search\r\nfor appropriate solutions to eradicate poverty. The\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative, the present framework for debt alleviation, is\r\ntoo slow and too selective and comes with restrictive\r\neligibility requirements that need to be made more\r\nflexible; otherwise, many countries will remain in\r\nperpetual poverty. Hence the urgent need to give fresh\r\nimpetus to this Initiative.\r\nIt is also essential to cooperate closely at the\r\ninternational level in order to further strengthen the\r\ncohesiveness of the coordination mechanisms of the\r\nvarious initiatives for Africa, so that that continent can\r\nbenefit more from development assistance.\r\nMoreover, while not a panacea, information and\r\ncommunication technologies are important factors, for\r\nthe developing world in general and for Africa in\r\nparticular, of growth and integration into the global\r\neconomy. The United Nations has a leading role to play\r\nin creating a partnership framework that would\r\npromote initiatives aimed at closing the digital divide\r\nso that technological benefits will not remain a remote\r\npromise.\r\nThe recent high-level debate of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council on the role of information technology\r\nhighlighted in a timely manner the urgent need to make\r\nthe digital revolution a tool for development and to\r\nfairly distribute its benefits through international\r\ncooperation. My country also fully supports the\r\nrecommendation of the high-level expert group,\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report, calling for\r\nuniversal access to new technology to be set out in a\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution as a basic human right.\r\nThe global partnership against AIDS in Africa,\r\nwhose vitality was demonstrated during the Durban\r\nConference, must henceforth be based, among other\r\nthings, on the mobilization of sufficient resources, on\r\nprevention and on access to drugs.\r\nIn an altogether different area, my delegation\r\nbelieves that particular attention should be given to the\r\ninsidious problem of malaria. Increasingly resistant to\r\nthe medical treatment used so far, this illness — which\r\nabove all affects the most vulnerable populations of\r\nwomen and children — is currently a source of\r\nprofound concern for Africa. This was confirmed by\r\nthe recent summit of heads of State held at Abuja,\r\nNigeria, on the issue. That meeting highlighted the\r\nimportance of preventive action and of increasing the\r\nmeans to combat malaria. There is thus a need for the\r\ninternational community to give this problem the full\r\nattention it deserves and to contribute further to\r\nmobilizing the necessary resources for the research,\r\nprevention, treatment and eradication of that disease.\r\nAt the threshold of the new millennium, the time\r\nis certainly right to rethink development. As the\r\nSecretary-General said at the tenth session of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), held in Bangkok, the time has indeed\r\ncome for a new global deal for least developed\r\ncountries. That new global compact will be aimed at\r\n36\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\ncorrecting imbalances and at making it possible for\r\neveryone to participate in the new world economy and\r\nto share equally in its benefits. Today, it is undeniable\r\nthat globalization has been accompanied by heightened\r\ninequalities and that, given the way it has evolved, it\r\nwill not be able to meet the expectations of poor\r\ncountries, whose rural and urban populations are\r\npaying a heavy social price for that process.\r\nMoreover, the failure of the recent World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Conference in Seattle has\r\ncompromised the launching of what was supposed to\r\nbe the development cycle that was finally to make it\r\npossible to attain the benefits of the much-touted trade\r\nliberalization. That development, it has been said in\r\npassing, is constantly being slowed by the\r\nprotectionism of industrialized countries.\r\nThe United Nations, as the democratic and\r\nuniversal body with the mandate to achieve the\r\nobjectives of development, must more than ever\r\npromote reform and coordination of the international\r\nmechanisms of trade and finance. To that end, our\r\ncommon Organization has the necessary moral\r\nauthority to regulate the process of globalization in the\r\ncommon interest of all. There is therefore a need to\r\nstrengthen its role and to put in place rules for good\r\nglobal governance that are capable of promoting — in\r\nthe words of that hallowed phrase — globalization with\r\na human face.\r\nWith the holding in 2001 of the international\r\nconference on financing for development and the third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries, we hold out the resolute hope that there will\r\nbe greater mobilization of financial resources, better\r\ncoordination of policies and more effective cooperation\r\namong development actors, in particular among\r\nGovernments, the United Nations system, international\r\nfinancial institutions, the private sector and civil\r\nsociety, so as to achieve the major objectives of\r\npoverty eradication and development.\r\nThe praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations to\r\npromote and consolidate new and restored democracies\r\ndeserves strong support, as that is in keeping with the\r\nwill of our Organization to meet the aspirations of the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nWe in Niger fully appreciate all the valuable\r\nassistance given by the United Nations system and\r\nfriendly countries for the restoration of democracy.\r\nAfter more than a decade of political and institutional\r\ninstability, Niger — one of the least developed\r\ncountries of the world, which is bowing under the\r\nweight of the debt burden and the impact of the\r\ndownward trend in official development assistance and\r\nof climatic vagaries — has seen a return to democracy,\r\nin accordance with the profound aspirations of our\r\npeople. However, as was so well put in his swearing-in\r\nstatement by the President of the Republic, Mr.\r\nMamadou Tandja,\r\n“We are aware that the support of the\r\ninternational community is essential to succeed in\r\nthis recovery. We therefore appeal to all countries\r\nthat support peace and solidarity and to\r\ninternational organizations to accompany us in\r\nour efforts, on the basis of mutual beneficial\r\ninterests and with strict respect for national\r\nsovereignty.”\r\nWe would like formally to reiterate here our\r\ngratitude to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and all of Niger’s\r\ndevelopment partners for the invaluable support they\r\nhave constantly given my country and its people during\r\ntheir most difficult times.\r\nBy chance the schedule has it that Niger is\r\nspeaking just before the end of the general debate of\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the so-\r\ncalled Millennium Assembly. What, then, could be\r\nmore natural than for me to conclude my statement by\r\nrepeating our satisfaction with the outstanding work\r\ndone by our brother, Mr. Kofi Annan, at the head of the\r\nuniversal Organization? Whether it be in the area of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security or that of\r\ndeveloped countries’ providing development assistance\r\nto the least developed, the Secretary-General deserves\r\nour full trust, support and encouragement.\r\nNamibia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr.\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, your predecessor, Mr. President,\r\nwas a good President. His old companion in the\r\nstruggle, the late Mr. Johnny Makatini, as demanding\r\nas he was in his lifetime, would have been as proud as\r\nwe at seeing the unequalled diplomatic talents Mr.\r\nGurirab displayed for a whole year. I pay humble\r\ntribute to him here on behalf of Niger. I say to him:\r\n37\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nTheo, you will always be a freedom fighter.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAs for you, Mr. President, we know that the torch\r\nthat has been passed to you is in good hands. Your\r\npersonal competence and Finland’s tradition of always\r\nstanding with the weakest leads us fervently to believe\r\nthat the Millennium Summit’s conclusions will find in\r\nyou a true and committed advocate, so that at last our\r\nOrganization can acquire the new habits required by\r\nthe advent of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Marshall Islands, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jackeo Relang.\r\nMr. Relang (Marshall Islands): I would like first\r\nof all to congratulate the President, on his assumption\r\nof the office of President of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. I wish him every\r\nsuccess in this difficult and inspiring task. I would also\r\nlike to express my sincere appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his exceptional\r\nleadership during the fifty-fourth session.\r\nAllow me to include in this tribute the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his efforts and crucial role in maintaining\r\nand promoting the role of this Organization, and for his\r\ninspiration in strengthening its effectiveness and\r\ncredibility with respect to peace, security, justice and\r\ndevelopment in the world.\r\nI wish to add a few comments to the statement\r\nmade earlier by the representative of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia on behalf of the Pacific Islands\r\nForum countries.\r\nLet us pause for a moment to recognize the\r\ncontribution of the founding fathers and framers of the\r\nUnited Nations and its Charter. They produced a\r\ndocument which, in large measure, has contributed to\r\nan ever-increasing consciousness of the prerequisites\r\nnecessary for world peace. Today we should celebrate\r\nthe existence of the United Nations and its\r\naccomplishments, both of which offer us the\r\nopportunity to reflect on how collectively we can better\r\nchart our path and articulate our goals more clearly for\r\nthe next millennium. President Kessai Note’s address\r\nto the Millennium Summit reaffirmed the adherence\r\nand commitment of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands to the principles enshrined in the Charter for\r\nthe collective good of all people.\r\nI take great pleasure in reiterating the Marshall\r\nIslands’ warm welcome to the Government and peoples\r\nof Tuvalu, as the 189th Member of this Organization.\r\nIndeed, the admission of new Member States adds to\r\nthe legitimacy of the United Nations.\r\nOn the other hand, the denial of membership in\r\nthis Organization to the 23 million people of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, who have made a\r\nsignificant and meaningful contribution to international\r\ndevelopment, is contrary not only to the true spirit of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, but also to its principle of\r\nuniversality and to the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. We must strengthen the vital role of the\r\nOrganization in achieving the goals of conflict\r\nprevention, maintenance of peace, regional stability,\r\npromotion of fundamental human rights and\r\ndevelopment of democracy and international progress,\r\nand in fulfilling the aspirations of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination and engagement, because the United\r\nNations is the only Organization that can bring that\r\nshining light to those 23 million people. Furthermore,\r\nthe United Nations is the only forum for Member\r\nStates to build mutual trust and to resolve issues\r\nthrough peaceful dialogue. The guiding principles of\r\ndemocracy, respect for human rights and the right of\r\npeoples to self-determination must, in conformity with\r\nthe principles of justice and international law, continue\r\nto underpin our collective aspirations. This will require\r\nour concerted action in this new millennium.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands applauds\r\nand commends the unprecedented efforts made by the\r\nleaders of the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea\r\nand the Republic of Korea, who have engaged in a\r\ndialogue that may help chart a course towards lasting\r\npeace in that peninsula. I wish to state also that the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands\r\nencourages the leaders of Israel and Palestine to seize\r\nthe historic opportunity that is within reach to\r\npeacefully conclude a framework agreement towards\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East. I wish to commend\r\nthe efforts of the United States of America in this\r\nregard.\r\nThe immutable law of change makes it necessary\r\nfor the United Nations to continue to critically examine\r\nits performance and structures in search of practical\r\nand timely solutions. This it must certainly do, because\r\n38\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nthe current political landscape is vastly different from\r\nthe one that prevailed 50 years ago. It is characterized\r\nby a more than threefold increase in the number of\r\nnations with membership in the United Nations, and by\r\na heightened spirit of generosity and desire on the part\r\nof civil society and corporations to become more active\r\nplayers in the process of change. It is imperative,\r\ntherefore, that those elements and structures which are\r\nantiquated, those which have ceased to promote the\r\nwelfare of nations and those which no longer minister\r\nto the needs of a continually changing humanity be\r\nswept away and relegated to the pages of history.\r\nA more comprehensive review and restructuring\r\nof the Security Council, in line with the spirit of\r\nachieving a broader base for decision-making through\r\nconsensus and confidence-building, is clearly long\r\noverdue. Other critical issues in the reform process\r\ndeserve further examination, with a view to restoring\r\nthat body’s dignity and legitimacy and strengthening\r\nthe confidence and trust of the international\r\ncommunity. Enlarging both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories while ensuring an equitable\r\ngeographical distribution seems to be the way forward.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands remains\r\ncommitted to supporting the efforts by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and others to reform and streamline the\r\nmandates and activities of the United Nations and its\r\nother organizations and agencies. While the\r\npeacekeeping and general fund scales seem to be\r\noutdated, the process of reform must take seriously into\r\naccount the limited responsibility and capacity of small\r\nisland developing States such as the Marshall Islands to\r\nsustain their obligation in both categories. Also, now\r\nthat this Organization stands at 189 Member States, 14\r\nof them from the Pacific Region, the reconfiguration of\r\nour electoral grouping should be an additional matter to\r\nbe placed on the table. It may be a complex one, but\r\nthrough our collective inspiration it can be an\r\nachievable goal, to be considered without further delay.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is keen to\r\nfurther develop its ongoing active role and cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations specialized agencies and\r\nprogrammes. In the view of the Marshall Islands, those\r\nbodies’ efforts to make their operational activities more\r\neffective and responsive to the special needs of small\r\nisland developing States will undoubtedly play a key\r\nrole in the new millennium. The expansion of the\r\nResident Coordinator programme — which brings it\r\ncloser to home, where it belongs — is a case in point.\r\nWhile the human rights achievements recorded in\r\nthe 50 years since the proclamation of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights must be acknowledged,\r\nthere is a sense that much remains to be done before\r\nthe world can truly claim that the Declaration has\r\nbecome a common standard of achievement. The\r\nMillennium Summit is a significant acknowledgement\r\nof the need for all States to work together, in a spirit of\r\nunity and cooperation, to ensure that the fruits of\r\nglobal development are shared and made more\r\nequitable and just for the benefit of humanity at large.\r\nWithin the mandate of its Charter to promote\r\neconomic and social progress, peace and security, and\r\nsustainable development and prosperity, the United\r\nNations is the only fully representative Organization\r\ncapable of harmonizing our collective aspirations for a\r\npeaceful, stable and prosperous global village. The\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands endorses Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan’s report, “We the peoples: the role\r\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.\r\nAt the turn of the century, achievements have\r\nbeen realized, and this trend should be encouraged. Yet\r\nwe are living under many threats. Acts of terrorism do\r\nnot recognize national boundaries, and infectious\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis\r\nare poised to spread quickly throughout the world. Our\r\ndecisive and collective response is therefore more than\r\never required. In many developing countries, poverty\r\nand the deprivation of basic human rights, especially as\r\nconcerns women and children, seem directly linked to,\r\nand escalate, crime.\r\nWe must also strive to eliminate weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons. The\r\nuniversality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is a major concern.\r\nTrafficking in drugs and small arms represents a\r\nconsiderable challenge and a major threat for small\r\nislands such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands,\r\nbecause of its geographic isolation and the fact that it\r\nlacks the required resources and capability to combat\r\nthese phenomena. Our collective effort towards the\r\ncreation of an effective global response to address all\r\nof these threats is urgently required.\r\nWe realize that global environmental degradation\r\nis of our own creation. The issue of global warming is\r\na real threat to all, particularly to the Marshall Islands\r\nand to all small island developing States. There is no\r\n39\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\ndoubt that the survival of populations and cultures is at\r\nstake.\r\nThe Marshall Islands has already lost metres of\r\nusable and habitable land due to climate change and\r\nsea-level rise, and the rate of loss is increasing. This is\r\na matter of life and death. Implementing the legally\r\nbinding commitments agreed in the Kyoto Protocol is\r\nthe only significant step forward on the path of\r\nensuring effective global action to combat climate\r\nchange. There will be a terrible tragedy unless there is\r\ninternational cooperation. How will displaced\r\npopulations — whatever the reasons for their being\r\ndisplaced — be able to enjoy and sustain their basic\r\nhuman rights for generations to come? Will their\r\ncultures and livelihoods be able to survive for the\r\nbenefit of future generations?\r\nEducation and health are of paramount\r\nimportance to every country in the world. Education is\r\nthe key to the progress of any nation. We must\r\ncollectively strive to ensure that an educated\r\npopulation makes up a healthy and prosperous society.\r\nI am pleased to report that the Government of the\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands has taken some bold\r\nsteps, by allocating the greatest amount of its limited\r\nresources towards the improvement of its education\r\nand health systems. I take this opportunity to appeal for\r\nthe interest and support of the international community\r\nin joining us in this endeavour. I am particularly\r\npleased to convey the deep appreciation of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to\r\nthe Government of Italy for its generous support for\r\nour efforts to implement the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction. The first phase of the Marshall Islands solar\r\nenergy project would not have been implemented\r\nwithout its support, through the United Nations Trust\r\nFund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy. The\r\ninterest in and support of the international community\r\nfor the implementation of the other phases of the\r\nproject would be highly appreciated.\r\nThe Marshall Islands National Nutrition and\r\nChildren’s Council has been very active since its\r\ninception. In addition to establishing task forces on\r\nfood and nutrition, suicide prevention, substance abuse,\r\nneglect and disability, it made another significant\r\ncontribution with the agriculture, food and nutrition\r\npolicy, as the Marshall Islands strives to meet its\r\nobligations under the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild. Existing policies specifically aimed at the rights\r\nof the child are under review as we consider making\r\nthe Convention a part of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands legal system. A representative Commission on\r\nSustainable Development has been established with the\r\nmandate of ensuring that the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction is implemented in all its aspects. Other\r\nlegislation to curb illegal financial transactions will\r\nsoon be introduced in the Parliament’s current session.\r\nThese are some of the efforts being made by the\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands as it strives to meet its\r\ntreaty obligations and enhance the life of every citizen\r\nof the country. We cannot do it alone, and we appeal\r\nonce again to the international community for support.\r\nLet us have a United Nations that will meet the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I\r\nremind members that statements in exercise of the right\r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation listened carefully to the statement of the\r\nForeign Minister of Iraq. We would like to briefly\r\nclarify the following points.\r\nFirst, the Foreign Minister of Iraq accused\r\nKuwait of providing logistical support to United States\r\nand United Kingdom aircraft committing aggression\r\nagainst Iraq. Such accusations are inaccurate, although\r\nwe have often heard them from Iraq. They fall within\r\nthe “misinformation campaign” undertaken for some\r\nweeks now by Iraq against Kuwait, thus increasing\r\ntension and instability in the region.\r\nSecondly, the presence of foreign troops in\r\nKuwait is governed by defence and security\r\nagreements signed bilaterally by Kuwait with the five\r\npermanent members of the Security Council to\r\npreserve its security and stability. Kuwait signed them\r\nas a result of the brutal Iraqi invasion — a flagrant\r\nviolation of the United Nations Charter and of\r\ninternational law.\r\nThirdly, we wish to stress that Kuwait had not\r\nhosted any foreign forces before 2 August 1990. We\r\nhad a principled and well-known position on that\r\nsubject; however, the Iraqi invasion, as well as\r\n40\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\ncontinuous Iraqi threats and the lack of peaceful\r\nintentions on the part of the Iraqi regime, made it\r\nnecessary for Kuwait to take such steps for the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions by Iraq\r\nand to preserve Kuwait’s security and peace in the\r\nregion.\r\nFourthly, as for the Iraqi Foreign Minister’s claim\r\nthat Iraq has fulfilled its commitments under relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, we stated previously that\r\ncertain principal commitments remain to be fulfilled by\r\nIraq — mainly, freeing Kuwaiti prisoners of war, the\r\nreturn of stolen Kuwaiti property and the elimination of\r\nIraq’s weapons of mass destruction. The international\r\ncommunity, which is represented by the Security\r\nCouncil, recognizes that many international and\r\nregional organizations unanimously agree that the Iraqi\r\nregime has yet to fulfil its obligations in order that\r\nsanctions against the long-suffering Iraqi people be\r\nlifted. We call on Iraq to implement all Security\r\nCouncil resolutions so that it can resume its place\r\namong the family of Arab and world States and so that\r\nthis vital part of the world may regain its security and\r\nstability.\r\nMr. Eldon (United Kingdom): I would like to\r\nrespond briefly to the remarks made today by the\r\nSecretary of State and Vice-Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Argentina concerning the Falkland Islands.\r\nThe British Government does not accept the\r\nSecretary of State’s remarks about sovereignty. We\r\nhave no doubt about Britain’s sovereignty over the\r\nFalkland Islands and the other British dependencies in\r\nthe South Atlantic. Moreover, we have a duty to\r\nrespect the right of self-determination of the people of\r\nthe Falkland Islands, who have made clear their wish to\r\nremain British. The elected representatives of the\r\nislanders expressed their views clearly when they\r\nvisited the United Nations for the debate in the\r\nCommittee of 24 on 11 July this year. They asked the\r\nCommittee to recognize that they, like any other\r\ndemocratic people, should be allowed to exercise the\r\nright of self-determination. As the democratic voice of\r\nthe Falklands Islands people, they reiterated their view\r\nthat they did not want to be part of Argentina.\r\nDespite our differences with Argentina on the\r\nsubject of sovereignty, we continue to strengthen our\r\nbilateral relations — including this year through\r\nmeetings between Prime Minister Blair and President\r\nde la Rúa and between our Foreign Ministers — and to\r\nbuild on the agreement signed last year on practical\r\narrangements on matters of common interest in the\r\nSouth Atlantic. We are confident that our relations will\r\ncontinue to flourish in that spirit of cooperation and\r\nmutual interest.\r\nMr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nstatement made by the Foreign Minister of Iraq clearly\r\noutlined the manifestations and elements of the Anglo-\r\nAmerican aggression against Iraq and the Kuwaiti role\r\nin that aggression. Kuwait bears the same legal\r\nresponsibility as the United States, the United\r\nKingdom, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\r\nWe have not threatened Kuwait in our latest\r\nstatements. Iraq does not threaten. What we did was\r\ninform the international community of Kuwait’s\r\ninvolvement in daily aggression against Iraq and its\r\nattempts to harm our interests.\r\nThe no-fly zones represent an illegitimate use of\r\nforce against an independent State and a breach of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law. The\r\nofficial spokesman of the United Nations has stated\r\nthat the no-fly zones are the result of a unilateral\r\ndecision unrelated to the United Nations. A former\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations has also stated\r\nthat the no-fly zones have no basis in Security Council\r\nresolutions. The majority of permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council consider the imposition of no-fly\r\nzones to be an illegitimate use of force. Kuwait’s legal\r\nresponsibility arising from its involvement in this daily\r\naggression against Iraq is therefore clear and\r\nirrefutable. United States and United Kingdom aircraft\r\ntake off daily from Kuwait, as reflected in the reports\r\nof the Special Commission.\r\nThe representative of Kuwait once again raised\r\nthe issue of the missing, with the aim of politicizing\r\nthis humanitarian issue. I would stress yet again that\r\nIraq is holding no prisoners and has not interest in\r\ndoing so. There are, however, missing Kuwaiti, Iraqi\r\nand other nationals. The efforts of the Tripartite\r\nCommission and the International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross to find these missing are being hampered by\r\nthe insistence of the United States and the United\r\nKingdom on being allowed to participate in the\r\nactivities of these agencies and to politicize them,\r\nalthough those two countries have no missing\r\nnationals.\r\nThe representative of Kuwait raised the issue of\r\nIraq’s implementation of the Security Council’s\r\n41\r\nA/55/PV.27\r\nresolutions. Iraq has fulfilled its obligations under\r\nthose resolutions and the Security Council must now\r\nfulfil its own in return.\r\nMr. Cullen (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nArgentine Republic, having listened to the statement\r\nmade in reply by the representative of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, wishes\r\nto reaffirm the ideas put forth in the statement made in\r\nthe general debate this afternoon by Secretary of State\r\nand Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Enrique\r\nCandioti.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I apologize for seeking to speak for a second\r\ntime, though briefly.\r\nI should like to reaffirm our denial of the\r\nallegations made by the representative of Iraq. As to\r\nthe threats made against Kuwait, which he denied, Iraq\r\nhas been waging a campaign for several weeks, as I\r\nhave mentioned, to increase instability and tension in\r\nthe region. Most notable have been the accusations and\r\nthreats made by an Iraqi official on the anniversary of\r\nthe Iraqi invasion. Letters have been sent to the\r\nSecretary-General and issued as formal documents.\r\nThe most recent threat was that made by the Iraqi Oil\r\nMinister, who accused Kuwait of sabotaging Iraqi oil\r\ninstallations. We in turn have sent letters to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council and to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that have also been issued as official\r\ndocuments.\r\nAs for Kuwaiti prisoners, what the Iraqi\r\nrepresentative said is not new. All we ask is that Iraq\r\nfulfil its obligations under Security Council resolutions\r\n686 (1991), 687 (1991) and 1284 (1999) and cooperate\r\nwith the International Committee of the Red Cross. Let\r\nme recall that Iraq has been boycotting its meetings\r\nsince December 1998. Iraq also refuses to cooperate\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s high-level coordinator\r\npursuant to paragraph 14 of resolution 1284 (1999).\r\nFinally, the Iraqi representative has repeatedly\r\ndeclared that all of Iraq’s obligations have been\r\ndischarged. What of its obligations under resolution\r\n1284 (1999)? Iraq continues to refuse to implement\r\nthat resolution.\r\nMr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\napologize for asking for the floor again.\r\nI repeat that Iraq has not waged such a campaign.\r\nWe have pointed out the daily Kuwaiti and Saudi\r\naggression against Iraq since 1991 and the attempts\r\nthat have been made to sabotage our interests. Once\r\nagain, the representative of Kuwait raised the issue of\r\nmissing Kuwaiti nationals and I have responded to it.\r\nHe also raised the issue of Iraq’s implementation of\r\nSecurity Council 1284 (1999). I believe he did so at the\r\nbehest of his masters.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n"
