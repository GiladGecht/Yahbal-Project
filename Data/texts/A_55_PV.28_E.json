(Finland)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mungra\r\n(Suriname), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I ask for the cooperation\r\nof all speakers in observing the voluntary 20-minute\r\nguideline for their statements. The full text of their\r\nstatements will be distributed.\r\nThe first speaker is His Excellency Mr. Joseph\r\nMutaboba, Chairman of the delegation of Rwanda.\r\nMr. Mutaboba (Rwanda) (spoke in French): May\r\nI first, on behalf of our Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nwho could not be here, on behalf of my delegation and\r\non my own behalf, join previous speakers in extending\r\nto the President our heartfelt congratulations on his\r\nelection to preside over the fifty-fifth session.\r\nIn addition, I congratulate his eminent\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, on the quality and great\r\nquantity of activities carried out during the recent\r\nSummit.\r\nI also take this opportunity to congratulate and\r\nwelcome Tuvalu, the 189th Member of our\r\nOrganization. We hope that other potential Members,\r\nsuch as Western Sahara in Africa, will soon be able to\r\njoin us.\r\nThe Millennium Summit — in which the Head of\r\nState of Rwanda, Mr. Paul Kagame participated —\r\nevaluated the twentieth century and formulated\r\nrecommendations for enhancing the work of the\r\nOrganization in the twenty-first century, now\r\nbeginning. As a number of speakers emphasized, the\r\ntwentieth century was the era both of great and\r\nunprecedented technological triumphs and of crises as\r\ngreat as the new means of destruction.\r\nThe distressing feature of the First and Second\r\nWorld Wars was that they made use of the advanced\r\ntechnologies of the late nineteenth century and the first\r\nhalf of the twentieth century to cause enormous human\r\nand material devastation. In 1918 and again in 1945 all\r\nhumanity was overwhelmed by the terrifying\r\nconsequences of a world war. “No more wars leading\r\nto the loss of millions of human lives”; “No more\r\ngenocide”: these were the calls of the founding\r\ncountries of the United Nations when they met in San\r\nFrancisco in October 1945.\r\nToday, as in the past, the international community\r\nfinds itself reliving horrors that it thought it had\r\nbanished for ever, horrors that include the genocide in\r\nRwanda in 1994. It certainly was not a lack of\r\ntheoretical principles of public morality or\r\ninternational law that contributed to preventing or\r\nstopping this genocide. These principles had even been\r\ngreatly strengthened in 1948 by the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and had been widely\r\ndiffused throughout the world by many organizations\r\nthat took up the banner of human rights.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nThe Brahimi report (A/55/305) was needed. We\r\nwelcome its conclusions and recommendations, and\r\ntake this occasion to warmly congratulate our\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, on having\r\ncommissioned it and the two others that preceded it:\r\nthe Srebrenica report and the courageous Carlsson\r\nreport. Our Organization had its failures, but the\r\nBrahimi report tells us that we can do better in the\r\nfuture. To miss this unique opportunity to reflect on\r\nwhat must be done, and how, would be to renounce our\r\nresponsibilities and the principles and values expressed\r\nin the Charter of our Organization. Another Rwanda or\r\nSrebrenica would disgrace us all.\r\nUndoubtedly, we must look elsewhere for the true\r\nsource of the problem. It is surprising that even today\r\ncountries that claim to embrace human rights are\r\ndelaying and using pretexts to block prosecution of the\r\nauthors of the genocide. There are even some who —\r\nafraid to accept or think about what happened — refer\r\nto this genocide as what happened in Rwanda in 1994,\r\nbeing afraid even to think about it. To take just one\r\nexample, I refer to the observations of Minister Yerodia\r\nNdombasi on 16 September.\r\nIn sum, my delegation calls on the international\r\ncommunity to draw every possible lesson from the\r\ngenocide committed in our country, so that “Never\r\nagain such a human tragedy” ceases to be an empty\r\nphrase. Much more urgent is the question of assistance\r\nto Rwanda for rebuilding and making good the huge\r\nmaterial and moral damage caused by the 1994\r\ngenocide. Such assistance was recommended in the\r\nreports of the Independent Inquiry set up by the United\r\nNations and of the Organization of African Unity’s\r\ninternational panel of eminent persons. All the\r\nmembers of the international community represented\r\nhere can help Rwanda rebuild and develop. And each\r\ntime we wish to do more for the Organization and\r\nhumanity let the Brahimi report serve as a source of\r\ninspiration.\r\nI take this opportunity to salute the Security\r\nCouncil discussions of 15 April, when the\r\nrecommendations of the Carlsson report were\r\nconsidered and the Council was urged to use its\r\ninfluence to ensure that they were effectively followed\r\nup by other United Nations institutions and agencies,\r\nincluding the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), from which we are awaiting special\r\nassistance as part of the development assistance\r\nprogramme for Rwanda. We venture to hope that the\r\nreforms under way at UNDP will lead to the provision\r\nof assistance based on a sincere and enthusiastic\r\npartnership according to the British model eloquently\r\noutlined by Prime Minister Tony Blair during the\r\nMillennium Summit. It is a partnership steeped in\r\nequality, justice and fraternal solidarity for all. We\r\ninvite all our partners to embrace this initiative, in their\r\nrelations not only with Rwanda, but with all the other\r\ndeveloping countries — especially the former colonies.\r\nThe reports that I have mentioned also justly call\r\non the international community — beyond contributing\r\nto the task of overcoming the devastating effects of\r\ngenocide — to contribute vigorously to preventing this\r\ncrime against humanity, in particular by suppressing it.\r\nThose who hide, protect and advocate for the criminals\r\nresponsible for the 1994 genocide should think twice\r\nbefore persisting in this evil behaviour.\r\nI now come to the Congolese crisis, certain\r\naspects of which can be seen as an extension of the\r\ngenocide committed in Rwanda in 1994. It is worth\r\nrecalling that after their defeat and withdrawal many\r\nmilitia members and former Rwandan soldiers who\r\nwere authors of the genocide took refuge in what is\r\nnow the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Not only\r\nwere these former soldiers and militia members not\r\ndisarmed at the time, but they have benefited from new\r\nmilitary equipment and training, allowing them to\r\ncommit acts of genocide along the borders and prepare\r\nfor a repetition of the previous widespread genocide\r\ncampaign. Is this not sufficient reason to ask a\r\nresponsible Government to act to preserve the\r\nsovereignty of its country and the security of its\r\npeople? The Assembly can well understand that this is\r\nhardly a case of a security pretext, but, rather, of a\r\ncurrent reality.\r\nThe plan for a massive invasion by the genocidal\r\nforces was thwarted in November 1996 — thank\r\nGod — by the forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Army.\r\nBut from May 1997 to August 1998 it was necessary to\r\nonce again repel infiltrations from the Congo and to\r\nresist other acts of genocide committed in the north-\r\nwestern part of our country. The horrors of this\r\nrebellion have been the source of a number of\r\nresolutions, but the world seems to have rapidly\r\nforgotten them.\r\nIt is in this context that our country now has a\r\nmilitary presence in the Congo — a presence whose\r\nonly purpose is to prevent a recurrence of genocide in\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nRwanda by the same Interahamwe militia and soldiers\r\nof the previous regime. We have more or less\r\nsucceeded in achieving our objectives. Since 1998 we\r\nhave captured many soldiers of the previous regime\r\nand Interahamwe militia, contrary to what Minister\r\nYerodia Ndombasi told the Assembly on 16 September.\r\nMost of these soldiers — there are many of them —\r\nhave rejoined the army. We are continuing to hold 135\r\nof them while they await a decision.\r\nWe have also succeeded in saving some of the\r\nInterahamwe and the soldiers of the former regimes, as\r\nwell as innocent civilians who had been held hostage\r\nduring all this time for purely military and political\r\npurposes. In the category of liberated hostages, 12,000\r\nwere repatriated since August 1998, and the process\r\ncontinues. We have established centres to receive them\r\non our borders with the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, and several humanitarian organizations,\r\nincluding the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have also been\r\ninvolved. This is a secret to no one, and it has been\r\ndocumented by the UNHCR at Goma and Gisenyi.\r\nThose who are against our successes say that these\r\npeople are Congolese citizens that we have forced into\r\nexile in Rwanda, because their departure has created a\r\nvacuum in the operations of the allies of these forces of\r\ngenocide. They are our citizens, and no one can claim\r\nto love them as much as we do. They are at home,\r\nawaiting the others with open arms.\r\nMy Government welcomed the signing of the\r\nLusaka agreements in July 1999 and still upholds them.\r\nTheir main principles are, first, that the inter-\r\nCongolese political negotiations should lead to a new\r\npolitical order in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo; and, secondly, that the armed groups should be\r\npursued and disarmed, including former Rwanda\r\nmilitary and the Interahamwe authors of the 1994\r\ngenocide, who are still attempting to continue their\r\nmisdeeds, encouraged by certain of our Congolese\r\nbrothers who go so far as to deny their presence on\r\nCongolese territory with the sole purpose of vilifying\r\nus, to judge by the statement by Minister Yerodia\r\nNdombasi last Saturday.\r\nThe Rwanda delegation deplores the Kinshasa\r\nGovernment’s recently calling into question these same\r\nagreements, despite the fact that they are upheld by all\r\nthe countries concerned of the subregion, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Security\r\nCouncil. Just before that, the Congolese Government\r\nhad created controversy by refusing to authorize the\r\nfree movement of United Nations military observers;\r\nand that free movement would not be possible outside\r\nthose agreements, to which that country is a party.\r\nAs far as Rwanda is concerned, we believe that,\r\nat this time, the Lusaka agreements constitute the only\r\nframework that will guarantee a lasting peace in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in the\r\nsubregion. Any other approach in this matter would run\r\nthe risk of dangerously jeopardizing the peace process\r\nnow under way.\r\nFurthermore, the slowness and hesitations\r\nobserved in our Organization regarding the deployment\r\nof the forces of the United Nations Mission in the\r\nCongo must be reviewed, and advantage must be taken\r\nof the current offers to strengthen the presence of the\r\nUnited Nations in the zones evacuated by the signatory\r\nparties of the Lusaka agreements. Any attempt to\r\nreduce the force would only lead to the kind of\r\ncatastrophe from which the Brahimi report tries to\r\nspare us.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to commend\r\nthe growing role of regional and subregional\r\norganizations in resolving conflicts. As is well known,\r\nsuch a positive involvement has already led to\r\nconsiderable results in various parts of the world,\r\nincluding in South-East Asia and Western Africa. It is\r\nour hope that the United Nations will adopt a similar\r\napproach to regional contributions to its machinery for\r\nconflict resolution.\r\nIf the question of conflicts in the world continues\r\nto be one of the major preoccupations of our\r\nOrganization, it would no doubt be a good idea to pay\r\nspecial attention to their prevention. This requires\r\nbeing attentive to the efforts made to eradicate, or at\r\nleast attenuate, the root causes of conflicts, both\r\ndomestic and external.\r\nWith respect to Rwanda, the halting of the 1994\r\ngenocide was followed by courageous policies inspired\r\nby the tragic lessons of our recent history. These\r\npolicies were translated into the following actions for\r\nand factors of national reconciliation, as follows:\r\nIn July 1994, a Government of National Unity\r\nand a Parliament were established including all the\r\ncomponents of the Rwanda population and all the\r\npolitical circles of the country. This was an integrative\r\napproach such as had never before been known in\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nindependent Rwanda, despite the linguistic, socio-\r\ncultural and historical advantages that militate in its\r\nfavour.\r\nThe policy of exclusion, which lasted more than\r\n30 years in all sectors of national life, from education\r\nto employment, was eliminated. We are pleased to have\r\nabolished, 60 years after its introduction, the\r\nidentification card, which categorized people according\r\nto their ethnic origin and their place of origin and on\r\nthe basis of which decisions were taken to kill people\r\nor to spare their lives.\r\nA skilled, professional national army was\r\nestablished, including the forces of the Rwandan\r\nPatriotic Army, which liberated the country, as well as\r\na portion of the forces of the former regime that had\r\nseparated themselves from the perpetrators of\r\ngenocide. We welcome their bravery and their\r\ndiscipline. The United Nations needs troops of this\r\ntype for difficult operations in Sierra Leone and\r\nelsewhere.\r\nIn March 1999 the National Commission on\r\nHuman Rights and the Commission for Unity and\r\nNational Reconciliation were established.\r\nThe judicial system was rehabilitated, which\r\nguarantees the independence of the magistrature. This\r\njudicial system has been strengthened by a form of\r\njustice called gachacha, which, while keeping to\r\ninternational judicial norms, will benefit from major\r\ninputs of the population at the early stages of a trial.\r\nThis will have the advantage of accelerating the\r\nprosecution of those accused of genocide.\r\nIn two and a half years more than 3 million\r\nrefugees have been repatriated. This is all the more\r\nstriking since Rwanda’s refugee problem, having lasted\r\nfor more than 30 years, is the most numerous and\r\nlongest-standing in Africa. At present the only ones\r\nremaining outside the country are families of criminals\r\nresponsible for genocide and some refugees whom\r\nRwanda wants to repatriate, but who are still being\r\nmanipulated by those criminals. Our head of State\r\nasked them to return in his inaugural statement at the\r\nSupreme Court, and some of them have begun to come\r\nback voluntarily to the country.\r\nDemocratic elections were held last year.\r\nFollowing the upcoming local elections, they will be\r\ncompleted in October. These are orientations that today\r\nguide the policy of unity and national reconciliation,\r\nthe need for which became clear after the genocide of\r\n1994.\r\nBeyond the eradication of genocide, there are\r\nmany challenges that deserve the attention of the\r\ninternational community at the beginning of the new\r\nmillennium. These relate to the gaps between\r\ndeveloping countries and prosperous countries in the\r\ncontext of globalization, the reform of the United\r\nNations system and many other current problems, such\r\nas the spread of AIDS.\r\nWith respect to the gap between developing\r\ncountries and prosperous countries, the nineteenth and\r\ntwentieth centuries saw gaps between industrialized\r\ncountries and poor countries grow even wider. This\r\nresulted from technology as well as from political and\r\ncommercial inequalities left over from the colonial era.\r\nAfter independence many development proposals were\r\nmade, such as the provision of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product for development assistance,\r\ntechnology transfers, a new international economic\r\norder favouring fair remuneration for commodities, and\r\nso on.\r\nAll these strategies have been the subject of a\r\nnumber of international conferences. None of them has\r\nbeen implemented sustainably or consistently. Some of\r\nthem have remained theoretical and have not even\r\nbegun to be implemented as programmes. But it is\r\nnever too late.\r\nFor some time now, we have been in an age of\r\nglobalization of economies in the context of structural\r\ngaps that have not changed much since the sixties. My\r\ndelegation would like to emphasize the urgent need for\r\nthe preliminary adoption of certain measures to\r\nfacilitate the establishment of machinery for efficient\r\nglobalization. Is there any need to recall that the\r\nexternal debt of developing countries constitutes, in\r\nand of itself, a real handicap to their economic\r\nrecovery? How can one talk about growth in a context\r\nwhere external debt absorbs 60 per cent or more of the\r\nexport income of these same developing countries?\r\nWhat will be the result of globalization in an\r\nenvironment where the competition of market\r\neconomies reduces in advance the role of certain parts\r\nof the world to that of eternal consumers, with the\r\nmonopoly on production elsewhere? These are all\r\nquestions that deserve urgent answers and solidarity on\r\nthe part of the international community.\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nMy delegation believes more particularly that the\r\nsuccess of globalization requires courageous\r\naccompanying measures, such as eliminating the debt\r\nfor poor countries and providing support for economic\r\nintegration policies, in particular in Africa. This\r\nrequires our world Organization to endow itself with\r\nmachinery that can help to guide globalization.\r\nFor some time now, the United Nations has\r\nrightly been concerning itself, at the highest level, with\r\nthe reform of the functioning of its structures. This is\r\nan urgent matter, as it affects what is at stake for the\r\nfuture and even the survival of all of humankind, which\r\ncan no longer be managed in the same spirit and with\r\nthe same structures as 55 years ago. We should\r\nremember that the number of Member States has\r\nincreased from 51 in 1954 to 189 today; that is an\r\nirrefutable argument for democratization. In this same\r\ncontext, Africa, which has 10 times as many Member\r\nStates in the United Nations as it did when the\r\nOrganization was founded, must occupy the place it\r\ndeserves in the major decision-making bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations, such as the Security Council and\r\nothers. The Bretton Woods institutions must also\r\nchange their character and behaviour if globalization\r\nand equity are to be real and consistent.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to speak about that\r\nother challenge for our times: the AIDS pandemic. This\r\ndisease is currently responsible for the loss of more\r\nhuman lives that the most deadly wars. The people of\r\nthe poorest countries are the most vulnerable in the\r\nface of this disease of the century. The delegation of\r\nRwanda would like, from this rostrum, to make an\r\nurgent appeal to the international community to show\r\nsolidarity in the face of the threat of extinction of the\r\nhuman race that AIDS represents. Put simply, taking\r\nAIDS lightly trivializes the crime of genocide. Both are\r\nexterminating people and should be combated with\r\nvigour and determination.\r\nMore specifically, aid should be provided for\r\nhumanitarian — if for no other — reasons, so that the\r\nleast developed countries can benefit from the most up-\r\nto-date medicines, at affordable prices, that can provide\r\nrelief from people suffering from AIDS and do all that\r\nthey can to contain this scourge.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation is convinced that an\r\neffort to mobilize the greatest possible financial\r\nresources would enable scientific research to take place\r\nto bring this disease, and others, such as malaria, which\r\nare devastating a large part of the population, under\r\ncontrol.\r\nWe hope that the twenty-first century, which is\r\njust beginning, will usher in a world of peace and\r\nsolidarity that will meet the greatest aspirations of\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is His\r\nExcellency Mr. Patrick Albert Lewis, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Antigua and Barbuda.\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): Let me first of\r\nall congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his unanimous election\r\nto the mantle of the leadership of the world’s foremost\r\ninternational body. He is presiding in this, the last year\r\nof the present century, following the profound\r\ncommitments manifested at the Millennium Summit.\r\nWe look forward in eager anticipation to the\r\nimplementation of the Summit pledges, as small States\r\nare becoming more and more disillusioned with the\r\nactual manifestations and the selectivity of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI should like to offer congratulations to his\r\npredecessor, who, as we know, comes from a recently\r\nindependent country — a country which had to struggle\r\nin order to be entrusted with the management of its\r\nown affairs. In him, we saw a genuine attempt to move\r\ntowards some equilibrium in this body. As such, my\r\ncountry applauds his efforts, but we are still awaiting\r\nthe day when small countries will receive the respect\r\ndue to sovereign States.\r\nThis year we will be making a deliberately short\r\nstatement, in the hope that the Assembly will\r\nconcentrate on the myriad of problems with which we\r\nare plagued.\r\nSmall States do not equate with small problems.\r\nIn reality, the reverse is often the norm, particularly\r\nwhen the State in question is still on the periphery —\r\nthe periphery of the dominant industrial entities. In the\r\ncase of my country, peripheral existence emerged in the\r\npost-Colombian era when, along with other Caribbean\r\ncountries, we became colonies of exploitation, as\r\nopposed to colonies of settlement. Mercantilism\r\ndemanded our production of agricultural commodities,\r\nwhether indigo, cotton or sugar cane; it was a\r\nmonoculture, designed solely and purposely for the\r\nbetterment of the mother country, at the expense of the\r\ncolonies.\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nBut no doubt the question is being asked as to\r\nwhy I am raising that issue here. It is precisely because\r\nthe lingering reality is that we are sometimes moved\r\nto ask ourselves if we are still victims of the “Robinson\r\nCrusoe” mentality. To be a colony of\r\nexploitation meant that the entity was an area of\r\nunderdevelopment — an underdevelopment which\r\nmeant that we were to remain in that state in perpetuity\r\nif we were to fulfil the precise conditions for\r\nexploitation.\r\nThroughout history, smaller entities have been, as\r\nit were, invisible. We do not have small problems. How\r\ncould that be the case when nuclear waste is still being\r\ntrans-shipped through our waters, despite numerous\r\nand repeated protests, pleas and entreaties? We have a\r\nproblem with the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nwhich rules in favour of the interests of multinational\r\nenterprises and the countries benefiting from the\r\noperations of those enterprises. The Windward Island\r\nproducers of bananas were at a total disadvantage, as\r\nthey could not afford to pay the cost of adequate\r\nrepresentation before the WTO. In 1896, the silver-\r\nthroated orator, William Jennings Bryan, stood up in\r\nCalifornia and asked whether mankind should be\r\ncrucified upon a cross of gold. Today, we must ask if\r\nWindward Island humanity is to be snuffed out on a\r\nbed of yellow fruit, thereby sending a ripple effect\r\nthroughout the Caribbean, culminating in deprivation,\r\ndegradation, depression and the severest forms of\r\ndehumanization.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit round table, much\r\ntime was spent talking about globalization, without the\r\nfundamental reality of that globalization — so-called\r\nfree trade — being dealt with. In modern history, there\r\nhas never been free trade. It has been advocated,\r\nencouraged and even preached about. John Bright and\r\nRichard Cobden have been acclaimed for their “gospel\r\nof free trade”, but it has never been a reality. In the\r\nnineteenth century, it was propelled by the industrial\r\nand maritime countries which stood to benefit from it.\r\nIn the twentieth century, it has emanated from the\r\ndominant States, and the statistics demonstrate that it\r\nhas wrought havoc on most of the developing world.\r\nThis has primarily been the result of selfishness\r\nand the unwillingness to listen to and accept the\r\nconcerns of those who suffer most from it. Yes, we\r\nbenefit from the expanded use of the Internet, the\r\ngreater access to education and the ability to travel\r\nabroad more frequently. But we have been hurt by\r\nextraordinary pressures to control our economic\r\nadvancement, whether by the influence of\r\nmultinational enterprises or by maritime activity, which\r\ndeplete our resources and pollute our environment.\r\nInstead of our nutritional level improving, the statistics\r\nagain show that poverty has spread, and the sick in\r\npoor countries cannot access the medicines needed to\r\nimprove the health of their societies. If we are to have\r\nglobalization, let us recognize its imperfections and\r\naddress them meaningfully. Let us not preach, “do as I\r\nsay but not as I do”.\r\nGlobalization does not have a human face. We\r\ncontinue to hear about the opportunities for the\r\ndeveloping countries, but we are still waiting for the\r\nbenefits to be made manifest. While we wait, we would\r\nlike to remind this body that we remain disappointed\r\nthat the International Criminal Court will not be\r\ndealing with illegal trafficking in narcotics or with\r\nillegal trade in arms and terrorism. Let us be heard. Let\r\nus be seen. We do not have small problems.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, my Prime Minister,\r\nLester Bryant Bird, clearly demonstrated how the\r\nworld’s economic and political agenda is devised and\r\ndirected by a few of its most powerful Governments.\r\nHe stated that Antigua and Barbuda, as well as several\r\nother small countries,\r\n“have experienced the most blatant disregard for\r\nthe rules of international law, rules that have been\r\nspelled out by the General Assembly and upheld\r\nby the International Court of Justice.” (A/55/PV.3)\r\nThe principle now is “might is right”. The Prime\r\nMinister pointed out that all of this is being done by the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD), which believes that its States\r\nwill lose capital to other States because of their more\r\ncompetitive tax regimes. They have gone further by\r\ndubbing tax incentives “harmful tax competition” and\r\nlinking it most unfairly with money-laundering\r\nactivities, even when there is no evidence for the\r\ncharge. My country has voluntarily agreed to contribute\r\nmore for peacekeeping even with our strapped\r\nfinances, as we accept our role as a contributor to the\r\nwelfare of the globe. We would likewise hope that the\r\ndominant be fair to us.\r\nI can go on and on with our difficulties and our\r\nvictimization primarily due to our pusillanimous\r\nnature. For the first time in several years we have not\r\nelaborated on natural disasters. By now all members of\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nthe United Nations should know of our plight. We\r\nwould however wish to speak on a decolonization\r\nissue.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda has followed closely the\r\nquestion of Western Sahara, and even though we do not\r\nhave an international intelligence system, we are\r\ncalling for an implementation of the referendum, as the\r\nsignals for renewed violence, if the United Nations\r\ndoes not carry out its pledge, are quite clear. We do not\r\nwish to see, once again, the carnage witnessed in East\r\nTimor.\r\nThe conflict, as it has been underlined through\r\nresolutions of the United Nations, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, and the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nStates, must be resolved through the exercise of the\r\nSaharawi people of their right to self-determination.\r\nThe international community has for decades adopted\r\nthis legal framework as a basis for a just and durable\r\nsolution to the conflict. We believe that the referendum\r\ncan be organized before next year, and we are calling\r\nfor such. We do not wish another situation with the\r\noutbreak of violence.\r\nLet me sum up with a few things that Antigua and\r\nBarbuda would like to see at the United Nations. We\r\nwould like to press for the end of “selective”\r\nmultilateralism and move towards the incorporation of\r\n“genuine” multilateralism. We desire to have a reform\r\nprocess expanded beyond the Secretariat and practised\r\namong all countries of the Organization. Reform\r\nshould not connote expansion, it should mean\r\nrestructuring. The principle of rotation on the major\r\ndecision-making bodies, particularly the Economic and\r\nSocial Council (ECOSOC), should become a reality.\r\nAnd may I repeat: the principle of rotation should\r\nbecome a reality. The concept of globalization should\r\nbe viewed in its entirety, and a study should be done on\r\nits effects on developing countries. The gross national\r\nproduct should not be used as the sole criterion for\r\ngraduating a State from concessionary loans, and the\r\nvulnerability index, on which Antigua and Barbuda is\r\nranked very high, should be taken into consideration.\r\nThe principle of “the equality of sovereign States”\r\nshould be used to guard against the marginalization of\r\nStates within the United Nations system. The countries\r\nthat have pledged to contribute 0.7 per cent of their\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) should carry\r\nout their commitment in this regard. There should be\r\nsome form of equity in regard to geographic groupings\r\nwithin the United Nations. While we understand the\r\nreasons why the existing groups were created, the time\r\nhas come for a more equitable arrangement. The\r\nnations comprising the United Nations should become\r\ntruly united.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda will continue to fulfil its\r\nobligations to its citizens and to this body. We\r\nrecognize the benefits that we accrue from our\r\ninvolvement in this parliament of parliaments. We have\r\nbenefited and will continue to benefit from the\r\nprogrammes of the various bodies and agencies of this\r\nbody. We are, however, confident that we have\r\ncontributed towards global progress, and we remain\r\nready to continue our contribution to the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hassan Kibelloh, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of the United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Kibelloh (United Republic of Tanzania): At\r\nthe outset, I should like to congratulate the President\r\non his well-deserved election to the presidency of this\r\nMillennium Assembly. I also want to congratulate his\r\npredecessor for his invaluable contribution and his\r\noutstanding leadership during the fifty-fourth General\r\nAssembly. In the same vein, I should like to register\r\nmy delegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor the excellent manner in which he is conducting the\r\naffairs of the Organization. Let me also take this\r\nopportunity to express our delight in welcoming the\r\nRepublic of Tuvalu as the newest member of the\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nTanzania is gratified that the recently ended\r\nMillennium Summit addressed some of the most\r\npertinent issues and challenges facing the United\r\nNations and its Members in the new millennium. Those\r\nissues include development and poverty eradication;\r\nthe effects of globalization, including technological\r\ndisparities; conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution; disarmament; and the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\r\nmalaria and tuberculosis. It was recognized that Africa\r\nand, particularly, the least developed countries suffer\r\nmost and hence demand urgent remedial action by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nPoverty remains one of the areas of great concern\r\nin Africa. The number of poor people in our region\r\nliving on less than one dollar a day is estimated to be\r\n300 million. That number represents more than\r\n40 per cent of Africa’s total population. Indications are\r\nthat the number of poor people in the continent is\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nlikely to increase as Africa’s output continues to drop.\r\nThere is therefore an urgent need for a comprehensive\r\nstrategy for Africa to address poverty eradication with\r\nall its ramifications. The strategy should include a\r\ncompendium of measures aimed at capacity-building in\r\nthe development process, including social services. The\r\nimplementation of such a far-reaching strategy for\r\npoverty eradication would very much depend on the\r\navailability of resources. Bearing in mind that in 2001\r\nthe United Nations will convene a High-level\r\nIntergovernmental Event on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, it is our hope that the issue of mobilizing\r\nresources for the development of Africa will be\r\nthoroughly addressed.\r\nOfficial development assistance continues to be\r\nparticularly critical in supporting development efforts\r\nin Africa and the least developed countries. It is sad to\r\nnote that flows of official development assistance have\r\nfallen to an all-time low of 0.2 per cent, far from the\r\nagreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national\r\nproduct of developed countries. My delegation\r\ntherefore wishes to appeal to our development partners\r\nto reverse the trend of declining resources and increase\r\nthe level of official development assistance\r\ncontributions.\r\nMany African countries are undertaking painful\r\nreforms aimed at attracting foreign direct investment.\r\nHowever, foreign direct investment flows have been\r\nminimal. Investors should feel encouraged to invest in\r\nAfrica because the competitive rate of return on foreign\r\ndirect investment stands at between 24 per cent and\r\n30 per cent. That rate is higher than those of all\r\ndeveloped countries, which stand at between\r\n16 per cent and 18 per cent. We therefore call on\r\nGovernments and relevant international organizations\r\nto assist in sensitizing potential international investors\r\nto the possibility of directing their investments to\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe various debt relief initiatives pursued by the\r\ninternational community have been helpful, but not\r\nsufficient, in providing a meaningful solution to the\r\ndebt problem of the developing countries. In some of\r\nthose countries, external debt service constitutes a\r\nmajor drain on scarce resources, taking at least\r\n30 per cent of the national income. In that regard, we\r\nwelcome the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative to support some of the poor countries in\r\ntheir efforts to resolve the external debt problem. My\r\nGovernment appreciates being one of the countries\r\nwhich have attained eligibility under this scheme. We\r\ncall upon the institutions concerned to speed up the\r\nprocess towards our reaching the completion point so\r\nthat we can fully benefit from HIPC relief.\r\nCommenting on the HIPC Initiative, my\r\nPresident, Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, has had this\r\nto say:\r\n“Tanzania welcomes the revisions made to\r\nthe HIPC Initiative. If implemented in full they\r\nwill provide additional debt relief, which in turn\r\nwill facilitate the war on poverty and will\r\ncontribute to sustainable growth and development\r\nif managed well. However, if growth is to be\r\nsustained, adequate levels of external funding\r\nmust complement our economic reform efforts.\r\nDebt relief under the HIPC Initiative should also\r\nnot be a substitute for increased bilateral non-\r\ndebt-creating aid, and neither should it be\r\nfinanced through reallocation of committed aid.”\r\nEven acknowledging the importance of the HIPC\r\ninitiative, the burden of meeting debt service payments\r\nwould remain heavy even after debt relief for most of\r\nthe least developed countries. We therefore call upon\r\nthe donor community to increase HIPC debt relief and\r\nto consider additional relief measures, including debt\r\ncancellation, so that scarce resources will be released\r\nto cater for economic development and poverty\r\neradication programmes.\r\nThe development of the least developed countries\r\ndepends on improvement of their capacity to produce\r\ngoods and services. Improvement of terms of trade and\r\nmarket access for the goods of least developed\r\ncountries in the developed countries’ markets would\r\nfurther contribute towards poverty eradication efforts.\r\nIn that regard, we call upon developed countries to\r\nprovide unhindered market access for goods from\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly from least developed\r\ncountries. In the same context, my delegation calls for\r\nspeedy implementation of the World Trade\r\nOrganization’s Integrated Framework for Trade-related\r\nTechnical Assistance which will facilitate the\r\nintegration of least developed countries into the world\r\ntrading system.\r\nThe development process of developing countries\r\nvery much depends on access to technology and on the\r\nendogenous capacity to develop it. We are encouraged\r\nthat the Millennium Summit reiterated the need to\r\nassist developing countries to leapfrog into new\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\ntechnologies in order to close the existing technology\r\ngap between developed and developing countries,\r\nespecially least developed countries. It is our sincere\r\nhope that the Millennium Declaration will be translated\r\ninto a concrete programme of action to assist\r\ndeveloping countries to develop the critical\r\ntechnologies, including information technologies,\r\nneeded for their development. We therefore call upon\r\nour development partners and all relevant international\r\ninstitutions to facilitate the transfer of technology,\r\nincluding environmentally sound technologies, on\r\nfavourable terms.\r\nMy delegation believes that South-South\r\ncooperation is an important means of realizing some of\r\nthe objectives of economic development. Tanzania\r\nfully supports the programme of action adopted last\r\nApril in Havana, Cuba, at the South Summit.\r\nTanzania recognizes and fully supports the role of\r\nwomen in the development process. Here, the\r\nGovernment has adopted a number of specific\r\nmeasures aimed at enhancing the participation of\r\nwomen in decision-making processes, and at bringing\r\nabout equal access to education and health, and access\r\nto credit on a preferential basis. In the area of\r\nrepresentation, for example, the Government has\r\nincreased the minimum quota of women\r\nparliamentarians from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The\r\nGovernment has also passed legislation that\r\ncriminalizes discriminatory activities against women.\r\nFurthermore, the Land Act was revised in 1999 to\r\nenable women to own land, the major means of\r\nproduction in Tanzania. Tanzania is firmly committed,\r\ntherefore, to implementing the Beijing Platform for\r\nAction. We therefore call on the international\r\ncommunity to support our efforts in this regard.\r\nSerious pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, malaria\r\nand tuberculosis are threatening the economic and\r\nsocial development of developing countries, especially\r\nAfrican and least developed countries. For example,\r\nthe scale of the HIV/AIDS pandemic has grown to\r\nalarming proportions in Africa. The Security Council\r\nhas recognized this menace as constituting a security\r\nthreat. Moreover, the Millennium Summit has\r\nunderscored the urgency of adopting effective action to\r\ncombat the scourge. Tanzania urges the international\r\ncommunity to assist developing countries in this\r\nendeavour, particularly in education and access to\r\naffordable treatment.\r\nDisarmament, peace and security continue to be\r\ncrucial to the aspirations of all humanity, and therefore\r\nthey constitute a critical challenge of the new\r\nmillennium. The existence of huge arsenals of nuclear\r\nweapons poses a major potential threat to world peace\r\nand security. These weapons continue to represent a\r\nthreat to the survival of mankind. Tanzania calls for the\r\ncomplete destruction and elimination of all nuclear\r\nweapons. The United Nations also needs to urgently\r\naddress the problem of small arms and light weapons,\r\nwhich fuel most of the ongoing conflicts in various\r\nregions of the world. In this context, we strongly\r\nsupport the convening of the 2001 United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects.\r\nThe Millennium Summit addressed extensively\r\nthe conflict situations existing in some countries,\r\nincluding those of Africa. The Summit reaffirmed the\r\nexistence of the intrinsic link between peace and\r\ndevelopment, which requires an integrated approach to\r\nconflict prevention, management and resolution. While\r\nsupporting United Nations peace efforts, we note with\r\nconcern that there has been a slow and an inadequate\r\nresponse to African conflicts from the United Nations.\r\nIn Angola, it is with apprehension that we bear\r\nwitness to the continuing hostilities and the grave\r\nhumanitarian situation brought about by Jonas Savimbi\r\nand his organization, UNITA; they have blatantly\r\nviolated the decisions of the Security Council\r\nregarding the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. It\r\nis disturbing that Mr. Savimbi has been able to sustain\r\nhis insurgency by violating the sanctions imposed\r\nagainst UNITA by the Security Council. We call upon\r\nthe international community to continue its support to\r\nthe Government of Angola.\r\nOn Burundi, my delegation is pleased to note that\r\nafter protracted negotiations between the parties\r\ninvolved in the Burundi conflict, the Burundi peace and\r\nreconciliation agreement was concluded in Arusha,\r\nTanzania on 28 August 2000. We welcome the\r\nagreement and commend the Facilitator, President\r\nNelson Mandela, for his role in reconciling the parties.\r\nWe also commend the regional leaders for their efforts\r\nin support of the Burundi peace process. Although a\r\nsmall number of parties to the conflict did not sign the\r\nagreement, efforts were made to ensure that all of them\r\nwould sign it. As I speak here, most of the parties have\r\nnow signed. It is our hope that the parties will abide by\r\nthe terms of the agreement and afford the people of\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nBurundi the opportunity to realize their aspirations for\r\npeace and development. We call upon the United\r\nNations and the international community to extend\r\nsupport to the agreement.\r\nAs for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\r\nLusaka Agreement remains the basis for the resolution\r\nof the conflict in that country. It is unfortunate, though,\r\nthat there is an impasse in the implementation of the\r\nAgreement. One of the reasons for the existing\r\nsituation is the mistrust among the parties. The delay in\r\nthe deployment of the United Nations Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has created a\r\nvacuum that has further contributed to the impasse.\r\nTanzania supports Security Council resolution 1234\r\n(1999). We also urge the Security Council to deploy the\r\npeacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo as soon as possible.\r\nOn Somalia, we welcome the agreement reached\r\nin Djibouti on the formation of the Government of that\r\ncountry. In this regard, we congratulate the\r\nGovernment of Djibouti for its constructive role in the\r\nreconciliation process.\r\nConcerning Western Sahara, Tanzania reiterates\r\nits support for the right to self-determination of the\r\nSahrawi people and the effort of the United Nations to\r\norganize and supervise an impartial, free and fair\r\nreferendum, in accordance with the Settlement Plan for\r\nWestern Sahara and the relevant Security Council and\r\nother United Nations resolutions. We urge the United\r\nNations to conduct, as soon as possible, the referendum\r\non the basis of the preparations that have so far been\r\nmade. The lessons of East Timor should not be ignored.\r\nOn the Middle East, Tanzania continues to\r\nsupport the cause of the Palestinian people. In this\r\nregard, we welcome the ongoing peace process aimed\r\nat achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in\r\nthat volatile region.\r\nThere is a direct linkage between conflicts and\r\nthe incidence of refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons. In this respect, Tanzania finds itself in the\r\nvery difficult situation of hosting more than 800,000\r\nrefugees, most of whom are products of the crisis in the\r\nGreat Lakes region. This is a huge burden for a poor\r\ncountry like Tanzania. Besides, refugees pose many\r\nproblems relating to security and environmental\r\ndegradation. There is an urgent need for the\r\ninternational community to increase its support to the\r\nrefugees, as well as to the refugee-hosting countries. In\r\nthe same vein, we reiterate our call for international\r\nburden-sharing and responsibility in refugee situations.\r\nA definitive solution to the refugee situation evidently\r\nlies in resolving conflicts so as to enable the\r\nrepatriation of refugees to their countries of origin.\r\nOne of the pressing reform issues in the United\r\nNations is the reform of the Security Council. Among\r\nthe significant changes of our time is the liberalization\r\nand democratization of economic and political\r\nprocesses. The Security Council cannot persist in being\r\nan exception. Its composition and powers must bear a\r\nrelationship to the democratic ideals necessary for its\r\ncontinued relevance and legitimacy. It is our hope that\r\nthe Council membership will be expanded in both\r\ncategories and that such expansion should include both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nFurthermore, Tanzania believes that the capacity\r\nof the United Nations to effectively carry out its\r\nmandate is contingent upon the willingness of all\r\nMember States to support it politically as well as\r\nfinancially. In this regard, we call upon the Member\r\nStates to provide it with adequate resources on a timely\r\nand predictable basis.\r\nTanzania also welcomes the many reform\r\nproposals and measures that have been introduced to\r\nimprove working methods, both at the Secretariat and\r\nat intergovernmental levels. For that effort to succeed,\r\nthere has to be consensus among Member States on the\r\nbest method to manage change in the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to observe that the\r\nMillennium Assembly, like the preceding Summit, is an\r\nact of partnership. We can only hope, therefore, that the\r\nrenewed enthusiasm and the recommitment to the\r\nCharter of the United Nations will galvanize our\r\nenergies and enable us to rise to and fulfil, the hopes\r\nand aspirations of the Organization and its peoples, as\r\nespoused in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ignacio Arcaya, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Arcaya (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nagain extend our congratulations to the President on his\r\nelection.\r\nThe Millennium Summit has charted for us a plan\r\nof action for the immediate future. We must\r\nconsistently bear that plan of action in mind as our\r\nmain priority, and direct all our work towards its\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\neffective implementation. We cannot view the final\r\ndocument adopted by the most important gathering of\r\nworld leaders ever held as a mere expression of good\r\nintentions and act as though it were a matter of routine\r\nand as if nothing had happened.\r\nFirst, we must take action to ensure that the vast\r\nmajority of the human race living in developing\r\ncountries make significant progress towards the\r\nattainment of sustainable development. We must make\r\nspecial efforts with respect to the millions of men,\r\nwomen and children who live in poverty. They must be\r\ngiven means of subsistence, education and medical\r\ncare.\r\nOur most important shared instrument, the United\r\nNations, is currently ill-equipped for that enormous\r\ntask. We must therefore focus on giving it the power\r\nand means to play an effective role in that important\r\neffort. We believe that the United Nations must play a\r\ncentral role in the struggle for development. To that\r\nend, we must consider without delay ways to\r\nstrengthen the General Assembly, our most democratic\r\nand open institution. It is equally necessary to\r\nstrengthen the Organization’s primary instrument in\r\nthis field, the Economic and Social Council, which\r\nshould become a real council for human development,\r\nwith authority and ability to act comparable to the\r\nSecurity Council’s.\r\nThe message of the Millennium Summit is very\r\nclear: peace and development are equally important,\r\nand each depends on the other. The most urgent tasks\r\nin the struggle against poverty are also clear: to\r\nalleviate the debt burden of highly indebted poor\r\ncountries; to tackle the scourges of AIDS and malaria;\r\nand to provide education for all. In all of those tasks\r\nthe United Nations must play a leadership role.\r\nIn order to meet the established goals of reducing\r\nworld poverty by half by 2015, we must ensure that\r\nnational Government’s measures adopted in accordance\r\nwith the social platform of United Nations conferences,\r\nto benefit their populations in the areas of health, food\r\nand education, are accompanied by international\r\ncooperation based on solidarity, in order that those\r\ntasks are carried out efficiently and promptly.\r\nIt is therefore particularly important, in order to\r\nsupport the objectives of, and strategies for, poverty\r\neradication, that developed countries meet their\r\ncommitment to dedicate 0.7 per cent of gross domestic\r\nproduct to official development assistance.\r\nIt is equally urgent to ensure that the rules\r\nregulating international trade and finance are just and\r\nequitable, not only in theory but also in practice, so\r\nthat they lead to development for all, and not merely to\r\nthe further enrichment of a privileged minority.\r\nIn that regard, the high-level intergovernmental\r\nmeeting on financing for development, to be held next\r\nyear, should result in effective coordination and\r\nharmonization of all the efforts Governments and\r\ninternational organizations, so that those efforts may\r\nbear tangible fruits meeting the needs of all countries.\r\nThe United Nations must be the coordinating centre for\r\nthe World Trade Organization and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions.\r\nWith regard to foreign debt, it is vital that the\r\ninternational community promote, on the basis of\r\nNorth-South dialogue, the adoption of concerted\r\nmeasures for the effective resolution of this problem,\r\nwhich is seriously weakening the sustained economic\r\ngrowth of developing countries affected by the\r\nexcessive burden of debt servicing. We believe that it\r\nwill be necessary to consider the timely rescheduling\r\non favourable terms of the international financial\r\ncommitments of developing countries, including highly\r\nindebted poor countries and medium-income countries.\r\nThe freeing of resources currently allocated to\r\ndebt payment will make it possible for those countries\r\nmore efficiently to meet the real needs of their\r\npopulations in the areas of food, health and education.\r\nIt will also promote their peoples’ participation and full\r\nintegration within their respective societies. It is also\r\nnecessary to recognize the economic and social costs\r\nincurred by developing countries in meeting foreign\r\ndebt payments.\r\nShared responsibility in dealing with economic\r\nand social issues, as well as with regard to questions of\r\npeace, requires more intensive and effective\r\nparticipation by developing countries in the world\r\neconomy, particularly in decision-making and the\r\nformulation of international and economic norms.\r\nThe efforts of the developing countries towards\r\npoverty eradication, economic and social progress,\r\nsustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment are dependent on a favourable\r\ninternational economic environment and on\r\ninternational cooperation for renewed and strengthened\r\ndevelopment. The magnitude and urgency of the\r\nchallenges facing us in the economic and social sphere\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nrequire the support of all Member States in order to\r\nrealize the aspirations of those who cry out for a more\r\nequitable and just world, in which poverty eradication\r\nand the promotion of development are a genuine\r\nexpression of international peace and stability.\r\nAs for our other main priority, the maintenance of\r\npeace, we must learn from our experience — both from\r\nour mistakes and from our achievements.\r\nThe United Nations must be provided with the\r\nmeans to anticipate and prevent conflicts, not just put\r\nan end to them once they have erupted.\r\nIn this respect, disarmament, including nuclear\r\ndisarmament, is vital, as is the elimination of the illicit\r\narms trade. Also key is the struggle against\r\ntransnational criminal activities such as terrorism and\r\nthe illicit drug trade.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the proposal of the\r\nSecretary-General to convene an international\r\nconference on the reduction of the nuclear threat. We\r\nbelieve that this could help strengthen the commitment\r\nto eliminate nuclear weapons, as recently agreed at the\r\nsixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nVenezuela supports the convening of the United\r\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next\r\nyear. That Conference will be a perfect opportunity for\r\nus to combine our efforts to adopt measures of\r\ncooperation to eliminate this illicit activity, which has\r\nlinks to organized transnational crime and is\r\nencouraged by unscrupulous groups or individuals who\r\nact unlawfully.\r\nThe role of the United Nations as the only forum\r\nempowered to authorize the use of force must be\r\nreaffirmed, without distinctions or exceptions, apart\r\nfrom self-defence, which in turn must be in strict\r\ncompliance with the provisions of the Charter.\r\nIt is urgent to this end to make effective progress\r\ntowards reform of the Security Council. This does not\r\nmean mere cosmetic change, but rather real reform,\r\nwith a view to ensuring its credibility as a democratic,\r\ntransparent and impartial organ in which no country\r\nhas the right to block, through the use of the veto,\r\naction agreed by the majority.\r\nIf we wish the Millennium Summit to have real\r\nsignificance, if we want it to be remembered not only\r\nbecause of the milestone represented by the\r\nparticipation of an unprecedented number of world\r\nleaders, we must take concrete action at this session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Towards that end, Venezuela\r\nfully supports the proposal made recently by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay to create a\r\nworking group to ensure implementation of the\r\nMillennium Summit Declaration. We believe that this\r\ngroup should be open to participation by all Member\r\nStates. We believe also that the representatives of the\r\ncountries that co-chaired the Summit and those that\r\npresided over the four round tables, as well as the\r\nChairmen of the regional groups, should participate\r\nactively in this process.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Anil Kumarsingh Gayan,\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional\r\nCooperation of Mauritius.\r\nMr. Gayan (Mauritius): It gives me great\r\npleasure to address the Assembly under the leadership\r\nof Mr. Harri Holkeri. I offer him our heartiest\r\ncongratulations on his election to preside over this first\r\nsession of the new millennium and assure him of the\r\ntotal support and cooperation of my delegation.\r\nWe would like also to thank Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, for the\r\nexcellent manner in which he presided over the work of\r\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. This\r\nyear again, we wish to compliment the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his remarkable leadership\r\nin the conduct of the work of the United Nations. We\r\npay special tribute also to the President of the fifty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly and to the\r\nSecretary-General for their imaginative and tireless\r\nefforts in achieving the resounding success of the\r\nMillennium Summit, held here just a few weeks ago.\r\nWe also wish to welcome Tuvalu as the newest\r\nMember of the United Nations family.\r\nDuring that historic Summit — the largest\r\ngathering of heads of State or Government the world\r\nhas ever seen — the relevance and importance of the\r\nUnited Nations in a global society was emphasized.\r\nWorld leaders pledged most prominently their\r\ncommitment to ensuring that the United Nations adapts\r\nto the new era and strengthens its capacity to deal with\r\nthe challenges of maintaining peace and security,\r\neliminating poverty and promoting development and\r\nprogress for the benefit of all humanity.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nSince its inception, the United Nations has been a\r\nbeacon of hope to mankind for a more secure and\r\nprosperous world. The recently adopted Millennium\r\nDeclaration provides fresh impetus to the United\r\nNations to rededicate itself to the fulfilment of the lofty\r\nideals of our Organization, namely to uphold world\r\npeace and security and promote cooperation and\r\ndevelopment in all areas of human endeavour.\r\nThe maintenance of world peace and security\r\nremains the biggest challenge for our Organization.\r\nThe continued existence of nuclear arsenals and the\r\nthreat of a nuclear disaster represent a major\r\nimpediment to the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nFollowing the end of the cold war, the feeling of\r\ninsecurity created by nuclear militarization has\r\ndiminished, but the international community’s\r\naspiration to global disarmament and the complete\r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction within a\r\ndefined time-frame has eluded us.\r\nWe welcome all the efforts the international\r\ncommunity is making towards achieving universal\r\nacceptance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). Yet more than 30,000 nuclear\r\nweapons are deployed around the world, including\r\nweapons that are still maintained in a high state of\r\nreadiness. The risk that nuclear weapons may explode,\r\nwhether by design or by accident, is ever growing. My\r\ndelegation is convinced that the early convening of an\r\ninternational conference on nuclear disarmament to\r\naddress issues of global denuclearization, including the\r\ntotal elimination of all existing nuclear weapons within\r\na specific time-frame, is of critical importance. Such a\r\nconference would allow all States, most importantly\r\nthose possessing nuclear capabilities and which do not\r\nfall under the purview of the NPT and the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), to\r\nvoice their concerns and contribute substantially\r\ntowards achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.\r\nThis is a debt we owe to generations yet unborn.\r\nThe role of the Security Council in the crucial\r\narea of international peace and security is evident.\r\nHowever, this central organ of our Organization will be\r\nrendered even more effective if it is further\r\nstrengthened to make it respond positively to the\r\nemerging new realities which the new millennium is\r\nbound to confront.\r\nMembers of the United Nations attach great\r\nimportance to the need for reform of this supreme\r\nbody. It is to be noted that under the existing provisions\r\nof the Charter, which date back from a time when two\r\nthirds of the Members of the United Nations were still\r\nunder colonial rule, a handful of States on the Security\r\nCouncil have the power to make decisions that bind the\r\nwhole membership. Such a mode of operation is\r\ncompletely out of tune with today’s realities, and, for\r\nthis institution to retain its credibility, it should\r\nundergo a comprehensive reform, taking into\r\nconsideration proper and equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation.\r\nIn this regard, Mauritius supports the position of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) on the expansion and\r\nrepresentativity of the Security Council, and we look\r\nforward to an early conclusion of the work of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council.\r\nWe support an increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, and we are in favour of making the\r\nCouncil an effective representative body that can act in\r\nthe interests of humankind at large at all times.\r\nThe meeting of the Security Council at the level\r\nof heads of State during the Millennium Summit was\r\nan unparalleled opportunity for the 15 Members to\r\ndiscuss, at the highest level, how to make peacekeeping\r\noperations more responsive. We are all aware that\r\ndeployment of United Nations troops in conflict\r\nsituations is seen as the last chance for the restoration\r\nof peace and, in this venture, we simply cannot afford\r\nto fail. Therefore, the discussions that took place at the\r\nsummit level of the Security Council need to be\r\nseriously pursued so that the future orientation of\r\npeacekeeping operations may be effected on a sounder\r\nbasis.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the proposals for\r\nimproving the United Nation peacekeeping\r\nperformance, as contained in the report of the Panel on\r\nUnited Nations Peace Operations — the Brahimi\r\nReport — and we look forward to their speedy\r\nimplementation.\r\nIt is indeed a sad reflection that at the dawn of a\r\nnew century, several African nations, such as Angola,\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone,\r\nBurundi, Somalia and the Comoros remain trapped in\r\ncivil conflicts with disastrous consequences for\r\nmillions of people on the continent and in the\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nsubregion. At the regional level, the OAU, as well as\r\nleaders of the subregions concerned, have spared no\r\nefforts to address each of these conflicts, but we need\r\nto realize that no great success has been achieved so\r\nfar. The intransigence of the main protagonists\r\ninvolved continues to remain the stumbling block\r\ntowards the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa.\r\nThe involvement of the United Nations in these\r\nconflicts has unfortunately also met with little success.\r\nWe need to be imaginative, and we need to explore,\r\nwith the civil society in each country in conflict, ways\r\nand means to convincingly establish that the fruits of\r\npeace are achievable. We need to look at the\r\npermanence of our interests, and these are based in\r\npeace and stability.\r\nWe also note with great concern that, despite all\r\nthe efforts and steps taken by the OAU for a speedy\r\nreturn to constitutional order in the Comoros, the\r\nAnjouanese separatists and the military leadership in\r\nMoroni have signed the Fomboni Declaration in\r\ndefiance of the OAU and the international community.\r\nWe urge the international community to refrain from\r\nlending any support to the Fomboni Joint Declaration\r\nwhich, we believe, will undermine the unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of the Comoros. Indeed, it is\r\nunacceptable that the future of the archipelago of the\r\nComoros be compromised by two individuals who are\r\nnon-elected and do not represent the aspirations of the\r\npopulation. We reiterate our support to the OAU in its\r\nongoing efforts aimed at resolving the crisis, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Antananarivo\r\naccord, which remains the most viable framework for a\r\nlasting, consensual and durable solution to the crisis.\r\nWe call on the military regime and the separatists in\r\nAnjouan to cooperate with the OAU so as to achieve an\r\nearly resolution of the crisis.\r\nWe welcome the signing of the Agreement on\r\nCessation of Hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea\r\nthis year. This is a positive step, and we urge the OAU,\r\nthe United Nations and other States to continue support\r\nfor these two countries to take the next steps to\r\nconclude a settlement for lasting peace. Our region\r\ndeserves no less.\r\nWhile, inevitably, the international community,\r\nthrough the United Nations and regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, must continue to do all it\r\ncan to end the existing conflicts and prevent new ones,\r\nthere is an important aspect of civil conflict that cannot\r\nbe overlooked any longer. It has been established\r\nbeyond doubt that civil conflicts such as those in\r\nAngola and Sierra Leone have resulted from personal\r\nambition or greed for private enrichment on the part of\r\npowerful individuals, rather than in pursuit of a\r\nlegitimate cause and struggle for the common good. In\r\npursuit of their sinister designs, these individuals wage\r\nlong wars on and against their own people and, acting\r\nwith impunity, inflict untold suffering on the masses,\r\nincluding women, the elderly and children, cause\r\nrefugee problems within and outside their national\r\nfrontiers, and retard development and progress of their\r\ncountries We believe that such dangerous persons\r\nshould not only be condemned and stopped as early as\r\npossible from pursuing their unpatriotic designs, but\r\nalso should be made to answer to their people and to\r\nthe international community for the crimes they\r\ncommit.\r\nThe proposed International Criminal Court should\r\nserve as the tribunal of the international community to\r\ntry and punish such individuals and, the sooner it starts\r\nfunctioning, the better it will be for humanity at large.\r\nThe International Criminal Court will not only be a\r\ndeterrent for people who engage in heinous crimes but\r\nwill also be an important instrument for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Unless\r\nsuch a step is taken, the world will continue to face\r\nsimilar tragedies, and the perpetrators of such tragedies\r\nwill go unpunished.\r\nAt long last, we have seen a glimmer of hope for\r\nthe suffering people of Somalia. We congratulate the\r\nleaders of the Intergovernmental Authority for\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) for their initiative in putting\r\ntogether a peace and reconciliation process that will\r\nallow for the establishment of a representative\r\ngovernment to take charge of the affairs of the country.\r\nWe appeal to all factions in Somalia to come together\r\nand to take part in this new initiative, with a view to\r\nstopping the misery that the Somali people have\r\nendured for too long.\r\nImportant steps have been made this year towards\r\npeace in the Middle East. We congratulate President\r\nArafat and Prime Minister Barak for the courage they\r\ndemonstrated recently during the difficult negotiations\r\nin Camp David under the guidance of President\r\nClinton. We believe that, having reached such a crucial\r\nstage of the negotiations, President Arafat and Prime\r\nMinister Barak must meet the daunting challenge of\r\ntaking further steps forward to reach a final agreement.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nWe are confident that both leaders have the capacity to\r\nbridge the gaps and reach a mutually acceptable and\r\nsatisfactory agreement. We appreciate that the issues\r\noutstanding in the path of such an agreement are\r\ndelicate, but we are confident that the leaders of the\r\nregion will respond to the ardent wish of peoples\r\naround the world for a peaceful Middle East.\r\nIt may sound like an anachronism, but it has\r\nhappened just a few months ago in the Pacific\r\nregion — namely in Fiji and in the Solomon Islands —\r\nthat small bands of thugs have overturned\r\ndemocratically elected Governments. In the case of\r\nFiji, Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry together with\r\nhis whole Cabinet of Ministers, was held hostage for as\r\nlong as 56 days, in a struggle for political power. The\r\nPrime Minister was set free only after he finally\r\nconceded that his Government would resign.\r\nThe international community watched helplessly\r\nas the tragic situation unfolded in Fiji. The fact that\r\nthis is not the first time that a democratically elected\r\nGovernment is overthrown by unorthodox and violent\r\nmeans makes the situation all the more serious and\r\ncalls for the immediate attention of the international\r\ncommunity. Mauritius condemns unreservedly all\r\nattempts by any group, anywhere, to thwart the will of\r\nthe people by force. I am reminded here of the\r\nstatement of the United Nations Secretary-General at\r\nthe opening of the OAU Summit in Lomé this year\r\nwhen, applauding the OAU decision to exclude\r\nGovernments that have come to power by\r\nunconstitutional means from participating in OAU\r\nmeetings, he expressed the wish that some day the\r\nUnited Nations also would take a similar decision. The\r\ntime has come for us to seriously consider such\r\navenues in order to send a clear signal to people who\r\nare bent upon perpetrating constitutional violations in\r\ntotal disregard of the will of the people.\r\nMauritius remains fully committed to the respect\r\nand promotion of human rights, democracy, good\r\ngovernance and the rule of law. These principles are\r\nenshrined in our Constitution. With regard to human\r\nrights, our commitment goes far beyond our national\r\nborders, as reflected in our membership in various\r\nUnited Nations committees, where we play an active\r\nrole. Multi-party, free and fair elections constitute core\r\ntraditions jealously cherished by the people of\r\nMauritius. In the exercise of our valued democratic\r\nrights, on 11 September last, just 10 days ago. the\r\npeople of Mauritius, for the seventh time since our\r\nindependence in 1968, elected a new Government. This\r\nGovernment remains committed to supporting strongly,\r\nat the national, regional and international levels, the\r\nprinciples I have mentioned earlier.\r\nSince we met in September last, we have\r\nwitnessed several acts of terrorism in various parts of\r\nthe world endangering the lives of numerous innocent\r\npeople. The hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet, the\r\nkidnapping of unsuspecting tourists from a Malaysian\r\nholiday resort and bomb attacks in some capitals are\r\ngrim reminders of the dangers we face at the hands of\r\nunscrupulous and heartless fanatics. We condemn all\r\nacts of terrorism and call on the international\r\ncommunity to take concerted action to deal with this\r\nproblem. For our part, Mauritius stands prepared to\r\nplay a significant role in the United Nations and its\r\nvarious organs to combat all such acts which pose a\r\nthreat to international peace and security.\r\nI had some remarks on people-centred\r\ndevelopment, debt and globalization. I refer delegates\r\nto the text that will be circulated. I will now talk about\r\nregional cooperation.\r\nMauritius attaches great priority to global\r\npartnership in addressing the key issues of poverty\r\nalleviation, achieving sustainable growth and\r\ndevelopment, and peace and security. We believe that\r\nregional cooperation continues to be the inevitable\r\nroute towards strengthening international partnership\r\nand cooperation. Regional cooperation not only is\r\ndesirable, but constitutes a necessary dimension in the\r\nprocess of the regional integration of many economies\r\ninto the global economy.\r\nSmall island developing States, which constitute\r\none fifth of the membership of the United Nations, are\r\nin a particularly difficult situation due to their\r\nvulnerability to a wide range of ecological, climatic\r\nand economic factors. The specificities of these States\r\nhave been articulated in the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States. Constraints to their\r\nsustainable development include a narrow resource\r\nbase that does not allow them to benefit from\r\neconomies of scale, and the fact that they have small\r\ndomestic markets. They also rely heavily on external\r\nmarkets, which are usually geographically distant, and\r\ncosts for transportation, energy and infrastructure are\r\nhigh. In addition, small island States have little\r\nresilience to natural disasters. A vulnerability index of\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nsocio-economic and other parameters has been\r\nprescribed for these States in the Barbados Programme\r\nof Action. We urge the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations to coordinate their efforts in\r\ndeveloping and refining such an index, which should\r\nbe used, together with other factors, by the World\r\nTrade Organization and the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nto accord special and preferential treatment to this\r\ncategory of State.\r\nI wish to say a few words now about the Chagos\r\narchipelago and the island of Tromelin. Respect for\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity is, under the United\r\nNations system, an acquired and inalienable right of\r\nevery State, however big or small. We are conscious\r\nthat the United Nations favours the completion of the\r\nprocess of decolonization.\r\nFor a number of years now, we have continuously\r\nbrought before the General Assembly the question of\r\nthe Chagos archipelago, which has always formed part\r\nof the State of Mauritius. This Assembly will recall\r\nthat the Chagos archipelago, including the island of\r\nDiego Garcia, was detached by the colonial Power just\r\nbefore our independence, in violation of General\r\nAssembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of December 1960 —\r\nthe Declaration on the Granting of Independence to\r\nColonial Countries and Peoples — and 2066 (XX) of\r\n16 December 1965, which prohibits the\r\ndismemberment of colonial territories prior to the\r\naccession to independence. We have all along sought to\r\nresolve this issue bilaterally with the United Kingdom\r\nthrough dialogue, but there has been no tangible\r\nprogress so far. This issue has now reached a critical\r\nstage and we are extremely anxious to have meaningful\r\nnegotiations with the United Kingdom with a view to\r\nresolving this matter within the shortest possible time.\r\nWe also reiterate our demand that, pending a resolution\r\nof this issue, the former residents of the Chagos\r\narchipelago and their families, who were forcibly\r\nevicted and sent to Mauritius by the colonial Power, be\r\nallowed to return to their homeland.\r\nWe launch a fresh appeal to the former colonial\r\nPower, the United Kingdom, to come forward and\r\nengage in serious and purposeful discussions with us\r\ntowards the early settlement of the Chagos archipelago\r\nquestion. We wish to stress that Mauritius will never\r\nabandon its intention to reunite its territory and to\r\nassert its sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago.\r\nWe also urge France, with which we have been\r\ndiscussing the issue of the return to us of the island of\r\nTromelin, another outer island territory of Mauritius, to\r\nwork with us constructively for an early resolution of\r\nthis important issue. There is an agreement in principle\r\nfor the co-determination of the island and its\r\nsurrounding maritime space and we need to work out\r\nfurther modalities so as to arrive at a final solution on\r\nthis issue.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI was gratified by the meeting, on 6 September\r\n2000, of heads of State and Government of French-\r\nspeaking States Members of the United Nations. That\r\nmeeting allowed us to consider and arrive at the truth\r\nthat the United Nations is the keystone that will allow\r\nmankind to free itself from the chains and other\r\nprejudices that hinder the evolution of international\r\naffairs and globalization, the two main engines of a\r\nbetter future for all. This meeting offered French-\r\nspeaking States Members of the United Nations the\r\nopportunity firmly to assert their determination to\r\nachieve that objective.\r\nI wish to stress that the future to which we aspire\r\nand in which we place our hopes must develop in\r\nconditions of respect for and promotion of the plurality\r\nof our peoples, their cultural and ethnic diversity and\r\ntheir multilingualism. We are duty-bound to respect,\r\nmaintain and preserve the nature of our world, that\r\nrainbow of many cultures which, through globalization\r\nand the United Nations, will be a source of enormous\r\nwealth for States and individuals.\r\nThe Republic of Mauritius daily lives out this\r\nvision of the future. Our experience prompts us to\r\nsubscribe to that vision for the common good. Hopes\r\nand dreams are built on concrete action. With the\r\nassistance of all its Member States, the United Nations\r\nmust enjoy better and greater means. Only thus will\r\npeace become a tangible reality. Without peace and\r\nsecurity, any effort at development is doomed to failure\r\nand the happiness to which the peoples of the world\r\naspire will remain dead letter.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIt goes without saying that, to achieve the\r\nobjectives of a more peaceful, just and prosperous\r\nworld, nations need to rededicate themselves to new\r\ncommitments in the twenty-first century. Our\r\ndelegation is ready to assume this responsibility and\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nlooks forward to a fruitful outcome for the session that\r\nlies ahead under Mr. Holkeri’s leadership.\r\nI wish to end on a note of optimism with regard\r\nto the capacity of the United Nations to address global\r\nissues and to spearhead development and progress. My\r\ndelegation is confident that our Organization and its\r\nspecialized agencies are poised to play an even greater\r\nrole in global reconstruction. We live in a highly\r\ndemanding world. It wants results, seeks accountability\r\nand is not ready to condone failures. We all have a\r\nresponsibility to make the world a safer place and to\r\nensure a better future for our people. We can do it. Let\r\nus do it.\r\nBefore I conclude, however, I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to confirm the candidature of Mauritius for\r\nelection to one of the non-permanent seats in the\r\nSecurity Council in the elections that are scheduled to\r\ntake place next month. As far back as January 2000,\r\nMauritius announced to all countries of the East\r\nAfrican region that we would seek election to a non-\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council. At that time,\r\nMauritius was the only declared candidate. The\r\nGovernment of Mauritius considers itself fully\r\nqualified to serve on the Security Council, which is the\r\nsupreme organ of the United Nations, in the larger\r\ninterests of peace and security and to contribute in a\r\nsubstantial measure to the important work of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs a multi-party democracy in a multi-ethnic\r\nsociety, Mauritius has a track record in international\r\nrelations and we consider that the standing of the\r\nSecurity Council depends upon that of its constituent\r\nmembers. The Security Council will be called upon to\r\ntake important decisions in the interests of peace and\r\nsecurity and it is important that the Security Council\r\nact as a homogeneous body. It is the wish of my\r\ncountry that our candidature be considered on its\r\nmerits. We will very much appreciate the General\r\nAssembly’s support in this regard.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Haile Weldensae, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Weldensae (Eritrea): At the outset, I wish to\r\nextend my congratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his\r\nunanimous election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. I am confident that,\r\nunder his able and wise guidance, this session will\r\nsuccessfully accomplish its tasks.\r\nI would also like to express appreciation and\r\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nNamibia, for the effectiveness with which he directed\r\nthe work of the last session.\r\nI also take this opportunity to extend\r\ncongratulations to the Republic of Tuvalu on becoming\r\nthe latest Member of the United Nations.\r\nWe shall not forget to express our thanks and\r\nappreciation to our Secretary-General, not only for his\r\ntireless efforts to ensure respect for the values,\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter,\r\nbut also for his far-sighted and thought-provoking\r\nmillennium report.\r\nThe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly is\r\nmeeting in the wake of the Millennium Summit, whose\r\nDeclaration embodies three fundamental messages.\r\nFirst, it reaffirms that the ideals and goals of the United\r\nNations are still sacred to humanity and that the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nare as valid today as they were in the past. Secondly, it\r\nreminds us that the lofty principles enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter require us to continuously\r\nstrengthen the United Nations and to make the\r\nnecessary adjustments and changes to enable it to meet\r\nthe challenges of justice, peace and security, poverty\r\nand disease, socio-economic development, the\r\ninequities of the global economy and the protection of\r\nthe environment. Thirdly, respect for the ideals and\r\nobservance of the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations remain the essential keys to the creation of a\r\npeaceful, prosperous and humane new world order. To\r\nthis end, the Declaration enjoins us to be loyal to these\r\ncommon ideals, goals, values and principles. It reminds\r\nus that each State has a responsibility to act not only by\r\nitself, but also within a regional system, to give the\r\nloyalty that is due to these values, goals, purposes and\r\nprinciples.\r\nIn this connection, I wish to join others before me\r\nwho have reminded us of the urgent need to reform the\r\nUnited Nations, including in particular the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, with a view to\r\nenabling the Organization to reflect the realities of the\r\ntimes and to empower it to meet effectively and\r\nefficiently the challenges of the day and the future.\r\nI wish to reaffirm the commitment of the people\r\nand the Government of the State of Eritrea to the noble\r\nideals and values, as well as the purposes and\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nprinciples, of the United Nations. Having made\r\nsupreme sacrifices and paid dearly, during a 30-year\r\nstruggle for independence and membership in the\r\ninternational community, Eritreans appreciate how\r\nessential the United Nations and its Charter are to their\r\nwell-being and prosperity. Having fully experienced\r\nthe horrors of a long war and the benefits of a short\r\npeace, they recognize the need for the peaceful and just\r\nsettlement of disputes and for cooperation for mutual\r\nbenefit in the long human struggle to create an\r\ninternational order based on justice and equality.\r\nTo this end, Eritrean foreign policy has been\r\npremised on the assumption that the threat or use of\r\nforce can never be an instrument of foreign policy, and\r\nthat even in a clear case self-defence it must be used\r\nonly after all available methods of peacefully resolving\r\ndisputes have been exhausted — and then only with\r\nextreme caution.\r\nIt is for this reason — and because Eritrea has\r\nsuffered from the non-application by the United\r\nNations itself of the principles of its own Charter and\r\nthe decisions of the General Assembly — that, upon\r\nindependence, Eritrea decided to make the ideals,\r\nvalues, purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter the cornerstone of its foreign policy. By its\r\nmembership, it had also hoped to play an active role in\r\npromoting the principle of the universality of\r\nmembership in the United Nations and in promoting\r\nthe achievement of fair and equitable regional and\r\ninternational orders.\r\nEritrea is also fully aware of its responsibilities as\r\na littoral State of a strategic international thoroughfare\r\nand has committed itself to contributing its share to the\r\nstability and security of the region, as well as to the\r\ncreation of a zone of peace and cooperation in the\r\nregion. To this end, it has made every effort to foster an\r\natmosphere that will enhance cooperation among the\r\nlittoral States of both sides of the Red Sea and promote\r\ndevelopment and mutual prosperity. It has also played a\r\nmajor role in the transformation of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\r\nfrom a simple natural disaster-control mechanism to a\r\nvibrant regional organization which will promote peace\r\nand cooperation among its member States, as well as\r\nadvance economic and social cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. The recent meeting of the ever-\r\nexpanding Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, in\r\nAsmara, our capital, is a testimony to Eritrea’s\r\ncommitment to the consolidation of the unity of and the\r\nbroadening and deepening of cooperative relations\r\nbetween African countries. This commitment will for\r\never be firm.\r\nIn spite of its victimization, Eritrea had decided\r\nto forget the past and to start with a clean slate as it\r\nevolved a vision, and set its priorities, for the future. It\r\nestablished good relations with all its neighbours on\r\nthe basis of the United Nations and Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity Charters and the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness. It assumed that there would not be any\r\nterritorial disputes with its neighbours, since its\r\ncolonial borders were clearly defined and recognized\r\nand had been accepted at independence by all its\r\nneighbours. It had no reason to assume that its\r\nindependence would be threatened by any State, near\r\nor far, any more than it had any reason to assume that it\r\nhad the right to use force to expand at the expense of\r\nits neighbours. Its sole ambition as a new member of\r\nthe international community was to make up for lost\r\ntime in development.\r\nIn spite of all its commitments and goodwill,\r\nhowever, Eritrea has, during its brief seven years of\r\nformal independence, been tested by and had to defend\r\nitself against political pressures, threats and actual\r\nattempts which endangered not only its sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity, but also its hard-won\r\nindependence. True, Eritrea may not be the only new\r\ncountry in history that has been so tested. Yet it must\r\nbe the only Member of the United Nations whose\r\nterritorial integrity — indeed, its very existence as a\r\nsovereign, independent State — has been threatened\r\nand is still being threatened at the beginning of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIt goes without saying that this struggle to\r\npreserve its independence has been detrimental to the\r\nnation-building and development efforts of the new\r\nState. Yet throughout this time, Eritrea has never\r\nwavered in its commitment to the peaceful resolution\r\nof the disputes. Indeed, it has solved two of its\r\nproblems peacefully on a bilateral basis and a third\r\nthrough international arbitration.\r\nIt was perhaps during the last two years that\r\nEritrea’s independence, sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity were most severely tested. What was labelled\r\na border dispute proved to be a serious attempt to\r\nreverse history and to recolonize Eritrea — or, failing\r\nthat, to truncate it, to Finlandize it, and to turn it into a\r\nsatellite State. This attempt was thwarted by the united\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\neffort of Eritreans at home and abroad. However, the\r\nattempt exacted its cost: the systematic and wilful\r\ndestruction of much of the economic and social\r\ninfrastructure of the country and the deliberate, brutal\r\nviolation of the human rights of Eritreans, including\r\nthe terrorizing and brutalizing of the population in the\r\noccupied territories.\r\nEritrea is convinced that there is no alternative to\r\nthe solution of conflicts by peaceful means and on the\r\nbasis of the Charters of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the existing\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nFrom the beginning of the conflict, Eritrea has\r\nrepeatedly declared that war can never be an option to\r\nresolve conflicts, that neither of the parties can settle\r\nthe conflict by imposing its will and creating facts on\r\nthe ground and then hope to achieve durable and\r\nmeaningful peace. It is a clear manifestation of its\r\ncommitment to peace and the rule of law that Eritrea\r\nstill remains committed to a peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict, notwithstanding the occupation of large tracts\r\nof its territory, the displacement of hundreds of\r\nthousands of its people, the continued brutalization and\r\nterrorization of the people in occupied territory and the\r\nfeverish war preparations for yet another attempt\r\nagainst its territorial integrity. It has already taken bold\r\nmeasures, shown flexibility and made important\r\nconcessions, however unpalatable they may have been,\r\nin the hope of achieving a just peace and in spite of the\r\nattempts that are being made to destroy the OAU peace\r\nproposals. Again, Eritrea pledges that it will continue\r\nto do its utmost to reach a comprehensive and\r\nconclusive agreement peacefully.\r\nYet, the fate of peace hinges on three critical\r\nfactors. First, the search for peace is a shared\r\nresponsibility. It cannot be left to only one of the\r\nparties. Secondly, peace can be made certain only when\r\nit is anchored on the values, ideals and principles of the\r\nCharter, which have been emphatically reconfirmed by\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. Among these is respect for\r\nthe independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nof States. Thirdly, peace can be achieved only with the\r\nfaithful implementation of agreements accepted by\r\nparties to a conflict. We invite all concerned to join\r\nEritrea in extending full cooperation to the OAU\r\nFacilitators, in making a genuine and unequivocal\r\ncommitment to the OAU peace process and in being\r\nfaithful to the letter and spirit of the provisions of the\r\nOAU peace documents, in particular the Framework\r\nAgreement and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.\r\nAt this juncture, I wish to seize this opportunity\r\nto renew our appreciation and gratitude to His\r\nExcellency President Abdelaziz Bouteflika for his\r\nunwavering commitment to the peaceful resolution of\r\nthe conflict, and to his personal envoy, His Excellency\r\nAhmed Ouyahia, for the wisdom and skill with which\r\nhe led the indirect talks. We also extend our\r\nappreciation to the international community, including\r\nthe Government of the United States of America and\r\nthe European Union, as well as other African\r\ngovernments, for their tireless efforts towards the\r\nachievement of a peaceful resolution and for the\r\npositive contribution they made to ensure the signing\r\nof the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in\r\nAlgiers on 18 June 2000. We request them to persist in\r\ntheir noble endeavour until a genuine and just peace is\r\nreally achieved.\r\nFinally, the Government of the State of Eritrea\r\nnotes with great appreciation the effort that has been\r\nexerted, and the commitments made, by the United\r\nNations to ensure an early, comprehensive settlement\r\nof the conflict. In this connection, I wish to draw the\r\nattention of the Security Council to the urgent necessity\r\nof deploying the peacekeeping force authorized by its\r\nresolution 1320 (2000) as quickly as possible in order\r\nto forestall any avoidable obstacles that may threaten,\r\nor even destroy, the gains that have been achieved at\r\ngreat cost and much effort by so many.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nChairman of the delegation of Benin, Mr. Joël Wassi\r\nAdechi.\r\nMr. Adechi (Benin) (spoke in French): It is my\r\npleasure to congratulate the President on his election. It\r\nbears witness to the esteem which the international\r\ncommunity has for his country and for him. In wishing\r\nhim every success in the conduct of our work, I should\r\nlike to assure him also of the sincere cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Benin.\r\nMay I also pay a well-deserved tribute to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, for the outstanding work\r\nhe accomplished.\r\nIn view of the developments in international\r\nrelations, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, had\r\nthe felicitous initiative of gathering the highest\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nrepresentatives of the peoples of the world for\r\nconsultations on a new world order and on the role\r\nwhich the United Nations will be called upon to play.\r\nI would like to pay him a well-deserved tribute\r\nand emphasize the determined conviction and\r\ncompetence with which he heads the Organization.\r\nThe Millennium Summit showed once again that\r\nmultilateralism and international cooperation remain\r\nthe best approach to confront problems in\r\nglobalization. Indeed, the positive effects of\r\nglobalization remain limited, as is borne out by\r\nimbalances in economic and social terms that\r\ncharacterize the world today and violate human dignity\r\nand human rights. What must be done therefore is to\r\nchannel the globalization process towards economic\r\nand social progress for the benefit of the greatest\r\nnumber.\r\nIn this process, the United Nations has a\r\ncomparative advantage — it is the only institution able\r\nto embody universally accepted values and the only\r\nplatform for organizing fruitful debate on world issues,\r\nas well as on the ways and means for settling them.\r\nThe United Nations is the body where the weak\r\nand the forgotten are able to make their voices heard\r\nand to participate in the attainment of a consensus on\r\nquestions of common interest.\r\nAnd, indeed, globalization today is a fait\r\naccompli; however, we must emphasize that it is not\r\nneutral. Good governance, democracy and transparency\r\nmust be consolidated not only in national terms, but\r\nalso in international relations.\r\nThese principles must be applied both within\r\nStates as well as with respect to forces that govern\r\nglobalization and make use of it as before to avoid any\r\nform of democratic control.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, the heads of State\r\nand Government adopted a document which determines\r\nthe main outlines of the United Nations action for the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIt is now up to the world community and, thus, up\r\nto our States, to civil society and to the private sector\r\nto show the necessary determination to implement the\r\nguidelines of the Summit quickly and resolutely to\r\nmake a reality of the message of hope and\r\ndetermination which was expressed by the leaders of\r\nthe world.\r\nBenin is pleased that special attention was\r\nfocused on Africa. The initiatives taken for the\r\ncontinent require the firm support of the development\r\npartners in the sense of a partnership and solidarity\r\nwhich must basically work on the following: a lasting\r\nsolution to the debt problem; a more just order for the\r\ninternational trade system; support in terms of financial\r\nresources and strengthening production capacity.\r\nWe call for the effective implementation of\r\nmeasures to integrate developing countries into the\r\nworld economy taking account of the special needs of\r\nthe least-developed countries with a view to halting the\r\ndeterioration in their situations.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIn this regard, the holding of the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries is of\r\nparticular importance. It is essential that it lead to\r\nconcrete results.\r\nThe elimination of poverty is one of the\r\nchallenges that the international community was unable\r\nto meet in the twentieth century. It is our responsibility\r\nto dedicate ourselves to this task. In this regard, we are\r\npleased with the initiative taken by the Administrator\r\nof the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) to organize a special ministerial meeting to\r\ndiscuss the strategic orientation of UNDP and the need\r\nto provide it with the resources essential for it to carry\r\nout its missions. Benin is relying on UNDP, the main\r\nbody for coordinating development assistance, to meet\r\nthe challenges facing developing countries.\r\nIn commending the countries that have\r\nannounced an increase in their official development\r\nassistance, I appeal for the restoration of a balance in\r\nfavour of core budgetary resources to make it possible\r\nto execute the programmes and projects to which\r\nGovernments accord priority.\r\nWith regard to financing for development, it is\r\nparticularly essential to ensure that resources are better\r\nmobilized and that development action involving all\r\npartners, including the Bretton Woods institutions, is\r\nbetter coordinated.\r\nAll these programmes and plans can be\r\nimplemented only in an environment in which peace\r\nand security are guaranteed. Benin therefore welcomed\r\nwith great interest the Brahimi report (A/55/305),\r\ncontaining an in-depth analysis of peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nWith regard to Somalia, Benin would also like to\r\nexpress its satisfaction with the leader of the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Development and all the\r\nfacilitators for their courageous initiatives to bring\r\npeace to that country through a process of dialogue and\r\nreconciliation. We appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to lend its support to the consolidation of\r\nthe process so that Somalia can rapidly become part of\r\nthe community of nations.\r\nBenin is, and will remain, committed to\r\nrespecting and promoting human rights, democracy and\r\nthe rule of law. These principles are inscribed in its\r\nConstitution. In that context, since the fifty-second\r\nsession the General Assembly has supported Benin in\r\nits organization of the Fourth International Conference\r\nof New or Restored Democracies, to be held in\r\nCotonou from 4 to 6 December 2000. This Conference\r\nwill undoubtedly be an important stage in the\r\ninternational community’s progress towards the\r\nconsolidation of democratic principles. At the\r\nConference the old and new democracies will exchange\r\ntheir experiences and commit themselves to promoting\r\ndemocracy, peace and political stability and\r\ndevelopment. Cotonou is preparing a warm welcome,\r\nand hopes that there will be a great response to its\r\ninvitation.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Narciso Ntugu Abeso Oyana, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Equatorial Guinea.\r\nMr. Ntugu Abeso Oyana (Equatorial Guinea)\r\n(spoke in Spanish): As head of the delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea, and on behalf of His\r\nExcellency Don Santiago Nsobeya Efuman, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and\r\nFrancophone Affairs, I am honoured to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nFirst, I congratulate you, Sir, former Prime\r\nMinister of Finland, on your election to preside over\r\nthe deliberations of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfifth session. We also sincerely congratulate Mr. Theo-\r\nBen Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister\r\nRepublic of Namibia, on the excellent work\r\naccomplished during the previous session and on his\r\nacclaimed activities in coordinating the preparations\r\nfor the Millennium Summit, which has just ended.\r\nI also take this opportunity to extend particular\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, and his team for their full commitment to\r\npromoting the mandate of the United Nations, as well\r\nas for the plan to strengthen its future work, as\r\nreflected in his outstanding report.\r\nWe warmly welcome the Republic of Tuvalu to\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nJust two weeks ago we celebrated within these\r\nfour walls the most important event in the history of\r\nhumankind, when our heads of State and Government\r\nestablished general guidelines that must govern the\r\nfuture of our Organization, and that form a strong\r\nfoundation on which we can, and must, work. We must\r\nnow follow up all the proposals and recommendations\r\nmade by our leaders, with the firm goal of\r\nimplementing them, which would result in a promising\r\nfuture for all nations — those of the North and South\r\nand East and West.\r\nHis Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo,\r\nPresident of the Republic, head of State and founding\r\nchairman of the Democratic Party of Equatorial\r\nGuinea, in his address on the first day of the\r\nMillennium Summit, affirmed that the turn of the\r\ncentury showed us a threatened world, one constantly\r\nin danger of collapse and in a permanent state of\r\nuncertainty about its destiny and the survival of\r\nhumankind, one that conveyed an apocalyptic feeling\r\nthat was shared by all alike — nations large and small,\r\nrich and poor.\r\nIn order to follow up the proposals and\r\nrecommendations of the Millennium Summit, we must\r\nstart with the fact that democracy begins at home. In\r\nour specific case, that means the United Nations, which\r\nis our shared home, where the voice of the majority\r\nmust prevail; that is a basic principle of the historic\r\nSan Francisco Charter of 1945.\r\nEquatorial Guinea therefore joins the call for\r\nurgent, much needed reform and empowerment of the\r\nUnited Nations — an appropriate formula for achieving\r\nthe fair and just representation of the African continent\r\nand other regions of the world, which we regard as a\r\nfundamental issue, particularly with regard to the\r\nSecurity Council. If this is not achieved, an\r\nenvironment of distrust may result, as well as a\r\nweakening of the role of our great Organization and its\r\nall-important task of promoting and ensuring\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAt present, some individuals enjoy a level of\r\nwealth which in the past was inconceivable, while the\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nvictims of poverty continue to suffer intolerable forms\r\nof deprivation. The poor remain marginalized and\r\nexcluded, and day by day their ranks are increasing\r\nconsiderably. Almost a quarter of the world’s\r\npopulation now lives in poverty.\r\nToday, pensions and social security protect many\r\nindividuals from poverty, but poverty in old age\r\nremains prevalent around the world. Poverty must be\r\nthe main concern in United Nations endeavours. The\r\nstruggle against poverty must be strengthened, and if\r\npossible poverty must be eradicated, because the\r\nsubject of poverty eradication is an ethical, social,\r\npolitical and economic imperative of humankind, as is\r\nfinding solutions to the conflicts and fratricidal wars\r\nthat take millions of victims in different parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nPoverty eradication requires an improvement in\r\neconomic growth and in employment opportunities.\r\nThe causes of poverty must also be tackled in the\r\ncontext of sectoral strategies, such as strategies for the\r\nenvironment, food security, health, education,\r\npopulation, immigration, housing, development of\r\nhuman resources, rural development, drinking water\r\nand sanitation.\r\nPoverty eradication is therefore one of the\r\nprimary tasks to which the peoples of the twenty-first\r\ncentury aspire, as an action which will promote the\r\ndevelopment and prosperity of the human being and\r\nwill consolidate the culture of democracy and the\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nOther problems that need analysis and solutions\r\nfrom the international community are the rights of the\r\nchild, the integration of women in development and the\r\nthorny issue of the foreign debt. As for the rights of the\r\nchild, we must see to it that the activities and the\r\nfollow-up of the World Summit for Children are\r\nintegrated with economic actions to be implemented as\r\na result of the other United Nations conferences held in\r\nthe 1990s. In this respect, we must see to it that there is\r\nrenewed thinking about the obligations stemming from\r\nthe ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild by each country and a renewed commitment to\r\nthem. This must guide our actions in the future.\r\nAs for the subject of women, we must eliminate\r\nall discriminatory practices against women and respect\r\nthe procedures and the provisions that are inherent in\r\nthe convention on this subject, as well as the\r\nrecommendations stemming from the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 and\r\nfrom the special session of the General Assembly held\r\nin June 2000.\r\nOn foreign debt, we fervently appeal to donors\r\nthat they cancel the foreign debt of the developing\r\ncountries with the understanding that the funds\r\nreleased will be injected into the most vulnerable\r\nsectors in the economies of those countries, such as\r\neducation, health, water and sanitation.\r\nWe are gratified that among the major areas of\r\nprogress in the twentieth century we see a growing\r\nawareness in humankind regarding respect for and\r\npromotion of human rights, democracy and good\r\ngovernance. In our country, because of the imperative\r\nof survival and the objectives of well-being and\r\nprogress, we will continue on the agreed path towards\r\nthe necessary restoration of all the rights to which our\r\nvulnerable and marginal groups aspire, in other words\r\nwomen, children, the disabled, refugees and those\r\npersons displaced by crisis and disasters. At the present\r\ntime in Malabo, the capital of our nation, we have\r\nofficially established the Centre for the Promotion of\r\nHuman Rights and the Committee in Support of the\r\nEquatorial Guinean Child. This Committee was\r\nestablished under the chairmanship of the First Lady of\r\nthe nation, Her Excellency Mrs. Constancia Mangue de\r\nObiang.\r\nWe have also experienced democracy in a spirit\r\nof joy with fraternity and without divisiveness, as is\r\ndescribed by our national anthem, and also without\r\ninternal upheaval. The national constitution, known as\r\nthe Magna Carta of Akonibe, clearly stipulates the\r\nestablishment and institutionalization of political\r\npluralism in Equatorial Guinea. This has made it\r\npossible for a number of political parties to be\r\nestablished. These parties have signed a national\r\ncovenant with the political party which is in power\r\nwith the purpose of establishing and strengthening\r\nmechanisms for dialogue among the parties. At the\r\npresent time, all are participating actively in aspiring to\r\npolitical power in the country. In this respect we thank\r\nGod, the Creator, for having inspired us in this model\r\nof participatory and peaceful democracy.\r\nIn September 1997 at the Congressional Palace of\r\nBata, the National Economic Conference was held with\r\nthe participation of all social sectors in our country. In\r\nthe final report of this important event, we find the\r\nrecommendations for programmes and projects to be\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nimplemented by the Government in the short, medium\r\nand long-term as our economic development strategy.\r\nWe cannot conceal our concern at the steady\r\ndecline in international cooperation resources towards\r\nEquatorial Guinea, as we have recently seen in many of\r\nthe projects and programmes that are implemented in\r\nthe country with external resources. In this respect we\r\nwant to avail ourselves of this forum to invite the\r\ninternational community to steadily increase the\r\nvolume of international cooperation activities in\r\nEquatorial Guinea.\r\nWith the primary purpose of ensuring peace and\r\nsecurity in our subregion, we hope that the United\r\nNations will support the appropriate mechanisms for\r\nthe maintenance of peace, security, stability,\r\ncooperation and development in the Central African\r\nsubregion, following the political will of the heads of\r\nState of that subregion, inspired by the establishment\r\nof the Council of Peace and Security in Central Africa\r\n(COPAX), a body for political and military agreement\r\namong the member countries of the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS).\r\nAs regards the promotion of measures for the\r\nmaintenance and the strengthening of peace and\r\nsecurity, we have, within COPAX, a Central African\r\nMultinational Force (FOMAC) and an Early Warning\r\nMechanism for Central Africa (MARAC). The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has\r\ncontributed with determination to financing these\r\ninstitutions so that they can function properly.\r\nWe sincerely regret the armed conflicts that exist\r\nat the present time on the African continent and in\r\nother parts of the world, for example, the case of\r\nAngola, the situation of the countries in the Great\r\nLakes region and the crisis in Sierra Leone. We\r\nwelcome the ceasefire in the conflict between Ethiopia\r\nand Eritrea, and it is our hope that the parties will\r\nundertake dialogue with a view to a lasting peace.\r\nLikewise, we view with satisfaction the restoration of\r\npeace and authority in the sister republic of Somalia. In\r\nthis respect, we commend the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the League of Arab\r\nStates, the Islamic Conference and all of those who\r\ndirectly or indirectly contributed to the arduous task of\r\nrestoring peace to that country.\r\nWe strongly condemn the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. We support the struggle\r\nagainst crime and the struggle against the global\r\nproblem of drugs and related crimes and against illicit\r\narms trafficking and international terrorism. We fully\r\nsupport the initiative reaffirmed by the Central\r\nAmerican countries in their commitment to make\r\nCentral America a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development and particularly to\r\ngradually and progressively stimulate the Central\r\nAmerican Union to ensure a promising future for that\r\nregion.\r\nIn the Middle East, we congratulate the\r\ncommendable political work done by the President of\r\nthe United States Bill Clinton to mediate a lasting\r\npeace in the region. We hope that a proper\r\ninterpretation and implementation of the proposals and\r\nrecommendations of our leaders at the Summit, as well\r\nas the outstanding statements made at this\r\ndistinguished Assembly, will guide us towards a better\r\nand more prosperous future for all the nations of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. José Adán Guerra, the Vice-Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Guerra (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nbegin by congratulating you, Sir, on your well deserved\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits first session of the millennium. Your proven skill\r\nand vast experience guarantee that you will ably guide\r\nthe work of this session. I wish also to express our\r\ngreat friendship for and gratitude to Finland, the\r\ncountry you so honourably represent, whose close\r\nfriendship with Nicaragua has earned our sincere\r\naffection. Let me also thank your predecessor,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for the dedicated way in which\r\nhe guided our work at the fifty-fourth session.\r\nI wish next to express very special thanks for the\r\ncontribution made by the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, who has prepared a\r\nvaluable report (A/54/2000) on the role of the\r\nOrganization in the twenty-first century; the report was\r\ncentral in stimulating the discussions conducted by our\r\nheads of State or Government at the Millennium\r\nSummit — an unprecedented event that laid the\r\ngroundwork for giving fresh momentum to the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe process of renewing the Organization\r\nrequires the strengthening of its organs and institutions\r\nso as to enhance the effectiveness of its endeavours in\r\nspheres such as the maintenance of international peace\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nand security, poverty eradication, the strengthening of\r\nhealth and education programmes and the struggle\r\nagainst the destruction of the environment. Without a\r\ndoubt, that depends on us, the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations; we must guarantee the Organization the\r\nresources and other means it needs to fulfil its mandate\r\nand fully to play its role as a centre for exchange of\r\nviews and for coordinating the efforts of the world’s\r\npeoples.\r\nIn that connection, let me reaffirm the need to\r\nreform the Security Council, an organ that is of vital\r\nimportance to peace and security. Such reform should\r\ninclude democratic, equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation and a better balance between developed\r\nand developing countries so that the Council will be\r\nable to respond fully and effectively to the present\r\nneeds of our peoples and to future challenges facing\r\nthem in the new millennium. Here, we see the veto as\r\nanother element of this sensitive issue that should be\r\naddressed seriously with a view to limiting its\r\napplication to very specific situations and to possibly\r\neliminating it. For those reasons, we believe it to be of\r\nparamount importance to reach consensus on all the\r\nissues that are inherent in the very structure of the new\r\ninternational order.\r\nWe wish also to stress the importance of speedily\r\nbeginning a process of international discussions aimed\r\nat attaining greater consensus and effectiveness in\r\nresolving humanitarian emergencies. In another vein,\r\nwe believe that we must reaffirm our commitment to\r\nmaintain and strengthen the universal mission of the\r\nUnited Nations to ensure that all the world’s peoples\r\nwithout exception enjoy fair representation. This brings\r\nme to reaffirm before the Assembly how important it is\r\nto give consideration to the longing of one people to\r\nparticipate with legitimate representation as a full\r\nMember of the Organization: I refer here to the\r\nRepublic of China.\r\nAnother important matter that the Organization\r\nshould continue in the new century to address with\r\ngreater determination is the war against drug\r\ntrafficking, organized crime and terrorism. Indeed, the\r\nflow of drugs is rapidly increasing in our countries, and\r\nin but a few years has become one of the most serious\r\nof problems, one that directly affects our economic,\r\npolitical and social life. To address that critical\r\nsituation, we must give priority to strengthening the\r\nnational institutions that are mandated to combat this\r\nscourge, to enacting and updating national legislation,\r\nand to increasing international cooperation and\r\ncoordination in this sphere. Here, let me observe that\r\nNicaragua has strict laws to punish drug traffickers,\r\nand has established a national drug-control plan under\r\nwhich institutions work together in a coordinated\r\nmanner to attain the stated objectives. We are also\r\nworking constantly towards greater international\r\ncooperation.\r\nAt the outset of the new millennium, we see an\r\nurgent need to deepen and accelerate progress on ways\r\nand means to achieve world disarmament, especially\r\nwith respect to weapons whose great destructive\r\npowers actually threaten life on our planet. We\r\ntherefore welcomed the outcome of the 2000 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which reaffirmed the\r\nconviction that full and effective implementation of the\r\nTreaty and of the non-proliferation regime in all its\r\naspects plays a vital role in the promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nSimilarly, we focus special attention on the\r\nproblem of conventional weapons and on the existence\r\nof anti-personnel landmines, which also pose a threat\r\nto human safety and security. We therefore believe it is\r\na priority to meet the obligations taken on by each\r\nState under international and regional conventions on\r\nthese subjects. In Nicaragua, one of the gravest\r\nconsequences of the armed conflict that was,\r\nfortunately, overcome in the 1990s is undoubtedly the\r\npresence of a vast number of anti-personnel landmines\r\nthroughout our territory, a situation that even today\r\nclaims numerous innocent victims. Accordingly, my\r\ncountry, with the support of the international\r\ncommunity, is making an enormous effort to resolve\r\nthe problem permanently. Along with mine-clearance\r\nactivities, we have begun the process of destroying\r\nmine stockpiles, and have thus far destroyed more than\r\n40,000 mines, in strict compliance with the Ottawa\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction. Nicaragua reaffirms its\r\ndetermination to spare no effort in the preparations for\r\nthe third meeting of States parties to the Ottawa\r\nConvention, to be held in Nicaragua in September\r\n2001.\r\nWe also believe it to be of the utmost importance\r\nto reaffirm our commitment to tolerance and respect for\r\ndiversity. In that connection, we support the\r\npreparatory work for the World Conference against\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance.\r\nIt is essential for the future of the Organization\r\nand for that of our peoples that we make a greater\r\neffort always to comply with the purposes that half a\r\ncentury ago were laid down in the San Francisco\r\nCharter, especially with respect to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. This can happen only\r\nwith a firm commitment to non-violence and to the\r\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes through\r\nthe procedures established by international law. That is\r\nthe key element in preventing future conflicts with\r\ngrave and enduring consequences for mankind.\r\nFor us, it is a source of satisfaction that one of the\r\nlast vestiges of the cold war is on the way to a peaceful\r\nresolution. Here I refer to the dialogue between the two\r\nKoreas, which has been launched at the highest level\r\nand which will without doubt mark the beginning of\r\npromising prospects for the Korean peninsula.\r\nNicaragua also shares the concern of the\r\ninternational community at the persistence of certain\r\nconflicts, particularly on the African continent; these\r\nhave caused devastating damage to property and the\r\nloss of countless lives in countries such as Angola, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone,\r\nBurundi and the Sudan. It is therefore gratifying that in\r\nsome of those countries steps have been taken to find a\r\nsolution to their conflicts. These include the 18 June\r\nsigning of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement by\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, and the implementation of the\r\nDjibouti peace initiative for Sierra Leone. We also hail\r\nIsrael’s withdrawal from Lebanon in accordance with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, and the stepped-up\r\nefforts, since the Camp David summit organized by\r\nPresident Clinton, to find a peaceful settlement\r\nbetween Israel and Palestine.\r\nIn the same vein, my country is convinced of the\r\nimportance of the principle of the self-determination of\r\npeoples; we note the urgent need to hold the pending\r\nreferendum in Western Sahara as soon as possible. To\r\nthat end, all obstacles to that process must be\r\novercome. Similarly, my country, convinced of the\r\nimportance of the principle of the self-determination of\r\npeoples, makes an appeal regarding the pressing need\r\nto hold, as soon as possible, the referendum pending on\r\nWestern Sahara. To that end, all obstacles to the\r\nprocess must be overcome.\r\nMuch progress has been made in this century.\r\nSome of the most important achievements have been in\r\nthe field of the technology revolution. Consequently\r\ntoday we have the great responsibility and duty to\r\nbegin this new millennium by pooling our efforts to\r\nachieve adequate levels of technology transfer to\r\ndeveloping countries in order to prevent globalization\r\nfrom becoming a negative phenomenon that\r\nexacerbates the marginalization of the poorest\r\ncountries.\r\nThe advantages and the disadvantages entailed by\r\nglobalization require the developing countries to work\r\ntogether in order to increase their opportunities to\r\nsuccessfully confront this phenomenon. An example of\r\nthis is the decision of the Presidents of Guatemala,\r\nNicaragua and El Salvador to sign a tri-national\r\nagreement aimed at giving fresh impetus to the Central\r\nAmerican integration process by providing an\r\nappropriate political framework for the establishment\r\nof a regional customs union, a process launched by El\r\nSalvador and Guatemala and which Nicaragua and\r\nHonduras have recently joined.\r\nApart from integration initiatives, continued\r\nefforts to achieve solidarity through cooperation for\r\ndevelopment are vitally important. Nonetheless, we\r\nfeel it must be emphasized that cooperation activities\r\nmust be accompanied by appropriate management that\r\noffers favourable conditions for small economies to\r\nhave access to large international markets, obtaining\r\nfair prices for their exports of raw materials and\r\nmanufactured goods. In this respect, we warmly\r\nwelcome the decision to convene the high-level\r\nintergovernmental event on financing for development\r\nin 2001. That event is of paramount importance to the\r\nefforts being made to achieve the objectives established\r\nby the Millennium Summit.\r\nThe strengthening of the multilateral trade system\r\nis also of great importance, which includes, among\r\nother things, the prompt and urgent convening of a\r\nround of trade negotiations within the framework of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) in which problems\r\nare addressed in a comprehensive and integral manner,\r\nto lead to an effective reduction of tariff and non-tariff\r\nbarriers. Free trade and the rules governing it should be\r\nimplemented within the WTO framework so that they\r\nbenefit all, particularly the poor countries.\r\nIt is also essential that the most heavily indebted\r\npoor countries be able to aspire to break the vicious\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\ncircle of poverty. In this regard, as stated by Mr.\r\nArnoldo Alemán Lacayo, President of Nicaragua,\r\nduring the Millennium Summit,\r\n“the unbearable weight of an immense external\r\ndebt [represents] an insurmountable barrier to\r\novercoming poverty and unemployment. In this\r\nrespect, we are pleased to note the interest\r\nrecently shown by the developed countries and\r\nmultilateral financial institutions in seeking\r\nalternatives that would substantially relieve the\r\nsituation of the heavily indebted poor countries.\r\nWe hope that this interest will soon be reflected\r\nin specific and meaningful actions, so that\r\ncountries such as Nicaragua can break this\r\nvicious circle of poverty and look towards a\r\nfuture with greater opportunities and expectations\r\nfor sustainability and progress.” (A/55/PV.3)\r\nAnother important challenge to which we must\r\ndevote great effort is the conservation of natural\r\nresources and the global environment; this is vitally\r\nimportant for the future of humanity, as well as for the\r\nprevention of and response to natural disasters.\r\nNicaragua has been cruelly punished by natural\r\nphenomena; the effects of hurricane Mitch, which\r\nlashed the Central American region in 1998, and of\r\nstrong telluric movement shook the eastern part of our\r\ncountry, causing loss of human life and considerable\r\nmaterial damage are still fresh. Given that reality,\r\nNicaragua, with the valuable assistance of the United\r\nNations Development Programme, became the third\r\nLatin American country to adopt a modern law to take\r\nthe necessary measures to establish an integrated\r\nsystem for disaster prevention and response. Moreover,\r\ndespite its limited resources, Nicaragua has channelled\r\ngreat energy into the search for a model of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and of conservation of its natural\r\nresources. In that regard, the Government of Nicaragua\r\nhas established the National Council on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, a pluralistic body in which all the main\r\nsectors of civil society participate, in order to promote\r\nactively, in accordance with Agenda 21, the\r\nimplementation of this model of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur leaders have had the historic opportunity to\r\nundertake decisive commitments for the future of\r\nhumanity. Nicaragua fully shares and reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the basic values contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration: freedom and equality, so that\r\nwe may all live decently, without poverty or violence,\r\nbut rather in good health and with education; equity\r\nand solidarity, since all peoples of the world have the\r\nduty to share and to exchange knowledge and\r\nexperience that tomorrow will be decisive for human\r\ndevelopment; tolerance and non-violence, since we can\r\nforge ahead only if people respect each other and if\r\nStates are always prepared to understand each other\r\nand resolve their differences through peaceful means;\r\nand respect for nature, in order to be able to leave to\r\nour children a future in which they will feel proud and\r\noptimistic, in which they will walk with their heads\r\nhigh, confident that they are on the right path.\r\nToday is the time to sow, so that tomorrow we\r\nwill be able to harvest. Today is when we must be\r\naware that we have a shared responsibility, collective\r\nand individual, to strengthen the United Nations in\r\norder to be able to build a more just, secure and\r\nequitable international system for all.\r\nThe President: It is now my intention to make\r\nsome concluding remarks. Thereafter I shall call on\r\nthose delegations that wish to speak in exercise of the\r\nright of reply.\r\nLet me start by again emphasizing the uniqueness\r\nof this Millennium Assembly, coming as it does after\r\nthe historic Millennium Summit, attended by 147 heads\r\nof State or Government, the largest gathering ever of\r\nworld leaders. The challenge facing this Millennium\r\nAssembly is to put into action the commitments made\r\nby world leaders in their Summit Declaration. The\r\nAssembly must maintain the millennium spirit and\r\nproceed with a sense of urgency, not with a sense of\r\nbusiness as usual.\r\nThe Secretary-General reinforced this in his\r\nstatement opening the general debate, in which he set\r\nthe tone for the two-week discussion. He said it was\r\nvital to find the means to make the Summit’s promise a\r\nreality and to turn the United Nations into a more\r\neffective instrument in pursuing the priorities outlined\r\nby the heads of State or Government.\r\nLet me now turn to some of the themes of the past\r\ntwo weeks. The most critical issue facing the\r\ninternational community — the maintenance of peace\r\nand security and the role of the United Nations in it —\r\nwas the focus of many speakers. The need for\r\nimproving the Organization’s peacekeeping capacity\r\nwas emphasized. In this regard, the debate reaffirmed\r\nthe mandate given by the Summit to consider\r\nexpeditiously the recommendations of the Panel on\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nUnited Nations Peace Operations. It was noted that\r\ntoday these operations are often comprehensive and\r\ncomplex, involving disarming and demobilizing\r\ncombatants, supervising elections, monitoring human\r\nrights and training local police forces.\r\nSome speakers referred to the need to develop a\r\nculture of prevention in order to combat conflict.\r\nIn the context of peacekeeping, reference was\r\nalso made to the need to close gaps between the tasks\r\nwe ask the United Nations to carry out and the\r\nresources we make available to it.\r\nThe importance of promoting and respecting\r\nhuman rights as a prerequisite to international security\r\nwas also emphasized.\r\nThe issue of Security Council reform and the\r\nneed for its composition to reflect the realities of today\r\nin order to make the Council more representative and\r\nmore legitimate was a theme repeated by many. Work\r\nfor the comprehensive reform of the Security Council\r\nin all its aspects was also called for in the Summit\r\nDeclaration. The statements made indicate — I hope —\r\nthat there is a willingness by the membership to move\r\nforward on this issue.\r\nA strong call was made in the general debate to\r\nimplement the goals and commitments of the\r\ndevelopment agenda of the 1990s. That agenda was\r\nreinforced in the Millennium Declaration, which\r\nexpressed the commitment of our heads of State and\r\nGovernment. Many statements rightly pointed out that\r\nwe are far away from the mutually agreed global\r\ndevelopment targets. Today almost one half of the\r\nworld’s population still lives on less than $2 per day.\r\nThere were several calls to bring to fruition the\r\ncommitments made in the Millennium Declaration to\r\nreduce poverty levels by the year 2015. It was also\r\nreiterated that conflict and poverty go hand-in-hand.\r\nSustainable development addresses not only the\r\neconomic and social needs of people, it also\r\ncontributes to lasting peace. The same goes for\r\ntolerance and respect for diversity within societies. I\r\nstrongly share the view expressed that respect for\r\nhuman rights is one of the cornerstones of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMany statements referred to the unsustainable\r\ndebt burden of the poorest countries and to the\r\nunfavourable terms of trade for many developing\r\ncountries. The need to address the debt burden of\r\nheavily indebted poor countries was reiterated. The\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly needs to\r\naddress development financing and the roles of various\r\nforums and institutions at the forthcoming financing\r\nfor development event. In my view, decisions on the\r\nformat, timing and venue of that event must be made\r\nwithout delay.\r\nThe discussion touched among many other\r\naspects of human life that require our common\r\nattention: the situation of the children of the world,\r\nilliteracy, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases,\r\nracism and racial discrimination, the deterioration of\r\nour environment and the pollution of the soil, water\r\nand atmosphere, and lack of food security. Many of\r\nthose issues will be addressed during the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nTo mention one of the most acute issues, there is\r\na need for an early decision on the HIV/AIDS special\r\nsession. I have sensed an urgency from the floor to\r\naddress this particular issue. To put this plea into\r\nperspective, we should remember that every minute\r\nseveral people — mostly young persons and very often\r\ngirls and young women — are infected with HIV. The\r\npandemic also underscores the need to include health\r\nissues in national education and literacy programmes.\r\nGlobalization and its impacts, both positive and\r\nnegative, was one of the overriding themes of the\r\ndiscussion. Globalization provides both opportunities\r\nand challenges. Positive impacts have been identified,\r\nsuch as increased economic growth and an improved\r\nstandard of living. The major challenges, however,\r\nremain how to reduce the gap between the rich and the\r\npoor within and among countries and how to share the\r\nbenefits of globalization in a more equitable way. In\r\nthe course of the debate it was also reiterated that to\r\naddress globalization we have to think in a\r\nmultidimensional way. Globalization encompasses not\r\nonly economic dimensions, but also political, social,\r\nenvironmental, technological and cultural ones. That is\r\nwhy the responsibility for shaping globalization cannot\r\nbe left to market forces alone. There is a need to guide\r\nthe process of globalization with political decisions.\r\nThis is where the General Assembly has a role to play.\r\nAs mentioned during the general debate, all this\r\nrequires enhanced international cooperation, building\r\nbridges between societies and improved global\r\ngovernance. International and multinational actors,\r\nsuch as the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization and various\r\nregional organizations, are becoming increasingly\r\nimportant in harnessing the positive powers of\r\nglobalization.\r\nInformation and communications technologies\r\nhave an important role in managing globalization, and\r\nas vehicles for development. Helping to bridge the\r\ndigital divide by making information and\r\ncommunications technologies the servants of\r\ndevelopment is one of the challenges ahead. No one\r\nshould be denied access to knowledge.\r\nMany spoke of the importance of environmental\r\nprotection and sustainable development issues while\r\npointing ahead to the Rio + 10 review conference, to be\r\nheld in 2002. In this context, global warming, climate\r\nchange and water were among the specific issues\r\nreferred to. The special concerns of small island States\r\nwere also raised.\r\nAnother important theme of the debate related to\r\ndisarmament issues. It was noted by many that lasting\r\npeace will not be secured until weapons of mass\r\ndestruction have been eradicated and the illicit trade in\r\nsmall arms and light weapons has been addressed.\r\nSome speakers stressed that in the face of massive\r\nhuman rights violations, the United Nations must not\r\nremain paralysed. Others felt that the principle of State\r\nsovereignty and non-intervention in their internal\r\naffairs was a basic principle of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nA number of speakers referred to the need to look\r\nafresh at the application of economic sanctions and to\r\nthe fact that, although they could be used as a tool for\r\npeace, sometimes they were counterproductive and\r\npenalized the population rather than the targeted rulers.\r\nSome said that time had shown that economic sanctions\r\nhad been unable to achieve their objective. Others\r\npointed to the burden imposed on third parties. There\r\nwere calls for a review of the sanctions regimes to\r\nmake them more effective and better targeted.\r\nFinally, let me say that I was pleased to listen to\r\nthe statements appreciating the need for civil society, in\r\nits broadest sense, to participate in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. I believe that the significance and\r\nrelevance of the United Nations in the future will\r\ndepend on our ability to involve civil society in our\r\nwork. It has played a pivotal role in setting our global\r\nagenda. We must let them also participate as our valued\r\npartners in its implementation.\r\nOverall, to quote one speaker, the debate\r\nreaffirmed the commitment of the international\r\ncommunity to the validity and importance of\r\nmultilateral action as being\r\n“the most realistic approach to transnational\r\nproblems in an increasingly globalized world”.\r\nI echo this sentiment and look forward to this being a\r\nmost productive fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond intervention and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Çengizer (Turkey): The Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Armenia, Mr. Vartan\r\nOskanian, addressing the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 18 September, remarked that the\r\nregion was adversely affected by the lack of formal\r\nrelations between Armenia and Turkey, and he went on\r\nto bring forth the well-known allegations concerning\r\nthe tragic events that took place in the early part of the\r\nlast century.\r\nIt is one thing to express dismay at the lack of\r\nformal relations and quite another to fervently defame\r\nthe other party while purporting to wish for a normal\r\nrelationship. To be precise, it is the Armenian side that\r\ninsists on imposing conditions on Turkey. It is the\r\nArmenian side that insists on the recognition of its\r\nsingular interpretation of history as the sole and only\r\ntruthful version. It is time for the Armenian side to\r\nlook into history with much more impartiality.\r\nWhat Mr. Oskanian presents as genocide was a\r\nmost unfortunate tragedy that befell the Turks and\r\nArmenians alike at a time when the Ottoman Empire —\r\ndecrepit, forlorn, partly occupied; lacking means,\r\nindustrial infrastructure and technological prowess; and\r\nfurther incapacitated by widespread epidemics and\r\nstarvation — was in the thrall of an imperialist assault.\r\nToday, on this historic threshold, it is not the time\r\nto focus on old enmity and hostilities. History is best\r\nleft to historians, not politicians. It is indeed\r\nunfortunate that Turkey and Armenia, two ancient\r\nnations living in the same geographical area, find\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nthemselves without normal relations. Precisely in this\r\ncontext, the fact that Mr. Oskanian desires normal\r\nrelations is gratifying, yet it is ironic, to say the least,\r\nthat this call is made without grace and is tantamount\r\nto asking Turkey to accept a distortion of history.\r\nAllegations of this sort will not help to bring about\r\nwhat is lacking. Rather, they do the opposite.\r\nIt is also incomprehensible to see a Government\r\naspire to normal relations with its neighbours while\r\ncontinuing defiantly to occupy one fifth of a\r\nneighbouring country’s territory, which it has done for\r\nalmost a decade now.\r\nMr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(spoke in French): My delegation had no intention of\r\ntaking the floor at this late stage of our work,\r\nespecially following the remarkable statement made by\r\nMr. Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nMy delegation will therefore be brief. We will not\r\nrespond to the wild imaginings and pointlessly\r\nprovocative remarks made from the rostrum by our\r\nsister delegations from Burundi and Rwanda, which\r\nhave deemed it necessary to insult the intelligence of\r\nthe representatives of the States Members of our\r\nuniversal Organization in an attempt to justify their\r\noccupation of the eastern part of the territory of my\r\ncountry, in flagrant violation of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, under the pretext of fallacious,\r\nso-called security considerations.\r\nMy delegation would like the entire world to\r\nknow that the people of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, weary of a futile and senseless war of\r\naggression, is seeking and desires peace. We want to\r\nlive in a strong and unified Republic of the Congo,\r\nwith its full sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nrestored. My people want to coexist peacefully with the\r\npeoples of the nine States bordering the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nMy Government, whose main task it is to ensure\r\nthe well-being of the population, is open to all\r\ninitiatives and suggestions that might put a quick end\r\nto this barbaric situation, which has bloodied the entire\r\nGreat Lakes region. This could be through the Lusaka\r\nCeasefire Agreement, as improved upon by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1304 (2000), which demands that\r\nUganda and Rwanda, which have violated the national\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, withdraw their troops without\r\ndelay; through direct negotiations between the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the aggressor\r\ncountries, whose representatives here have not denied\r\nthe fact that their countries have perpetrated acts of\r\naggression against mine; or through direct negotiations\r\nbetween the Government and those of our Congolese\r\nbrothers who have decided to resolve conflicts through\r\nthe use of arms.\r\nWhat is essential is that we be able to coordinate\r\nour efforts in order to obtain lasting peace throughout\r\nthe region. This might be guaranteed by the\r\ninternational community, perhaps through an\r\ninternational conference. The populations that\r\ncomprise our subregion, with their wide cultural and\r\nethnic diversity, deserve peace. They have a right to\r\npeace, without which any hope for human dignity, for\r\nwell-being and development, would be in vain and\r\ncompromised.\r\nMr. Harrison (United Kingdom): I should like\r\nbriefly to reply to the remarks about the Chagos\r\narchipelago made this morning by the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Regional Cooperation of\r\nMauritius.\r\nThe British Government maintains that the\r\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory is British and has been\r\nsince 1814. It does not recognize the sovereignty claim\r\nof the Mauritian Government. But the British\r\nGovernment has recognized Mauritius as the only State\r\nthat has a right to assert a claim of sovereignty when\r\nthe United Kingdom relinquishes its own sovereignty.\r\nSuccessive British Governments have given\r\nundertakings to the Government of Mauritius that the\r\nTerritory will be ceded when no longer required for\r\ndefence purposes.\r\nThe British Government remains open to\r\ndiscussions regarding arrangements governing the\r\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory or the future of the\r\nTerritory. The British Government has stated that when\r\nthe time comes for the Territory to be ceded it will\r\nliaise closely with the Government of Mauritius.\r\nThe question of access to the British Indian\r\nOcean Territory is at present before the courts in the\r\nUnited Kingdom and is therefore sub judice. The\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom has the matter\r\nunder careful consideration and cannot comment\r\nfurther.\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nMrs. Assounany (Comoros) (spoke in French): I\r\nhave the honour to make this statement on behalf of the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nIslamic Federal Republic of Comoros.\r\nI merely wish to give some necessary\r\nclarifications in response to what was said by my\r\ncolleague from our neighbouring State, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Mauritius. It is very regrettable that some\r\nneighbours of our country, to which we are bound by\r\nour common interests, whether within the Indian Ocean\r\nCommission or because we share certain Indian Ocean\r\nvalues, and some other countries, for reasons unknown\r\nto us thus far, are appealing to the international\r\ncommunity not to support but rather to condemn a\r\nnational process that allowed for the amicable\r\nresolution of a crisis that would have led to a military\r\nconfrontation in Anjouan. The Assembly is familiar\r\nwith the serious consequences of the use of weapons in\r\nlarge countries, and they are even more serious in a\r\nsmall country such as ours. The countries in question\r\ndefend within regional and international bodies the\r\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes, which\r\nis essential and precious to our Organization.\r\nFurthermore, with regard to the present regime, it\r\nwas the intervention of the national development army\r\non 30 April 1999, when disturbances over Anjouan\r\nbroke out in Moroni, that prevented civil war in\r\nComoros, where the political power of the time was\r\nparalysed and the Comorian people rejoiced at that\r\nintervention.\r\nI wish to recall also that the electoral timetable\r\nestablished in 1999 has not been implemented precisely\r\nbecause of the refusal of the Anjouan party to sign the\r\nAntananarivo accord. Today, with the signing of the\r\nFumboni Joint Declaration, the way is open to again\r\ndiscuss together this Comorian question. The\r\ndeclaration preserves the unity and territorial integrity\r\nof Comoros, and the new Comorian entity as a whole is\r\nrecognized as the only subject of international law\r\nwithin the borders recognized by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe understand perfectly well the desire of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and neighbouring\r\ncountries to defend the unity and territorial integrity of\r\nour country. But we believe that their concern is not\r\nequal to ours, as Comorians with interests to defend\r\nand to preserve, and could not transcend that. One\r\ncannot be more royalist than the king.\r\nWe would like to reassure all those who are\r\nconcerned about the essential aspect of this matter that\r\nit is preserved by the Fomboni Declaration.\r\nFurthermore, this process enjoys the support of the\r\nLeague of Arab States, which recently adopted a\r\nresolution along these lines at its Council of Ministers\r\nmeeting in Cairo. Other leading partners of our country\r\nalso support this process.\r\nWe therefore leave it to the international\r\ncommunity to appraise this situation in order to judge\r\nwhether we should stick to extremist positions, which\r\nare harmful to the population, or find a compromise\r\namong Comorians to put an end to the suffering of the\r\npeople, instead of choosing arms over dialogue.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia): When my country,\r\nsigned the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities with\r\nEritrea, it did so with a full commitment to work for a\r\ncomprehensive peace agreement. It believed, and still\r\ndoes, that the Agreement went beyond the simple\r\nsilencing of the gun. The Agreement’s spirit was also\r\nrecognized by a Security Council appeal to both\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea as covering all acts of hostilities,\r\nincluding the kind which we heard about from the\r\nEritrean Foreign Minister.\r\nWhen my Foreign Minister addressed the\r\nAssembly, he did so looking at the future, not at the\r\npast. His counterpart, the Eritrean Foreign Minister,\r\nalas, promised us in the first part of his speech, which\r\nwe welcomed, that he would do the same, but went on\r\nto the old story of trying to drag us into the quagmire\r\nthat we thought we were trying to get out of.\r\nWe thought that if we had — as we have —\r\nmatters to raise, this should be done within the context\r\nof the negotiations leading to a comprehensive peace\r\nagreement; there is a place for it, rather than bringing it\r\nup in this Assembly, thus taking your time, Mr.\r\nPresident, and that of everybody else at the close of\r\nthis general debate. However, under the circumstances,\r\nI am left with no choice but to take up some of the\r\npoints that have been raised in order to set the record\r\nstraight.\r\nWe have been accused of making Eritrea a victim\r\nof aggression. We are told that it was a country which\r\nhad established good relations with all its neighbours.\r\nWhat we have is the opposite. We have a country that\r\nbecame independent in 1993.\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nIt began the following year by attacking one of its\r\nfive neighbours; in 1995, it attacked a second; in 1996,\r\na third. It began 1997 by quarrelling with its closest\r\nneighbour, Ethiopia, leading to an invasion of its\r\nsovereign territory in 1998.\r\nThis reminds me of an Arabic saying: “He hit me\r\nand then hastened to launch a complaint”. This is what\r\nhas happened in our region. When we consider the\r\naccusation of the use of force by Ethiopia, we see that\r\nit was only an act of self-defence that Ethiopia — after\r\ntwo years of literally begging for peace — was forced\r\nto undertake to reverse that aggression. Eritrea talks of\r\nexpansion and recolonization, but many of us in\r\nEthiopia – particularly in this Government to which I\r\nbelong – fought for the right of the Eritreans to self-\r\ndetermination and supported them, although many\r\nothers in my country in fact never wanted Eritrea to\r\nsecede from Ethiopia. It took political courage to\r\nsupport Eritrea and we have no regrets over that. But\r\nthen, for Eritrea to say that such a country’s\r\nGovernment, which was the first to recognize its\r\nindependence, has intentions to recolonize it — I think\r\nthat is laughable, to put it very mildly.\r\nIf we had wanted, as a minimum — even without\r\ngoing to war — to deny Eritrea its rightful place, we\r\nwould have simply not given it recognition. We know\r\nfrom our experience in international law that a number\r\nof things have to be clarified before others recognize a\r\ncountry’s independence. We have a very good example\r\nin our own region of a situation in which one part of\r\nanother country that seceded and has not been\r\nrecognized to this day — although that country did not\r\nhave a functioning capital and still does not — despite\r\nthe good efforts that have been undertaken in Djibouti.\r\nSo Ethiopia cannot be accused of preparing for\r\nanother war to recolonize Eritrea. There is no such\r\nintention; there cannot be and will not be. We have\r\nturned our back on war.\r\nBut let us look, finally, at the issue of who is still\r\nbent on militarizing its own society. In May 1998,\r\nEthiopia had 54,000 troops and not one single soldier\r\non its border with Eritrea. On the other hand, Eritrea,\r\nwith only 3.5 million people — against Ethiopia’s 60\r\nmillion — had over 200,000 troops in May 1998.\r\nWhich country had a different agenda for developing\r\ngood-neighbourliness and for peace? We demobilized\r\nalmost 1 million troops under the previous Government\r\nto reach the figure of 54,000, and we are prepared to\r\nde-escalate again when the right time comes, because\r\nour region does not need war. We have to fight poverty,\r\nilliteracy and backwardness, not each other.\r\nFinally, as to the issue of this brutal violation of\r\nhuman rights, which has been raised as a distraction,\r\nagain I would just pass over it by saying that this is not\r\nand cannot be proven by anything that Ethiopia\r\nhas done. In fact, through our Prime Minister, we\r\nhave brought to the attention of the international\r\ncommunity — including your own country, Mr.\r\nPresident, at the highest level — what has been\r\nhappening and perpetrated by the other side against\r\ninnocent Ethiopian civilians in their own country, even\r\nafter the signing of the Agreement on Cessation of\r\nHostilities. It was only a few weeks ago that Eritrea\r\nfinally signed the Fourth Geneva Convention — it was\r\nthe last country to sign it — and for the first time\r\nallowed the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\naccess to people it had been supposed to have access\r\nto.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): It was not and is not my\r\nintention to open a discussion in this General Assembly\r\nHall on the issue of the Armenian genocide and its\r\nrecognition or on relations between Armenia and\r\nTurkey. However, since reference to these issues was\r\nmade by the representative of Turkey, I would like to\r\nmake a few points.\r\nThe twentieth century began for Armenians with\r\nthe tragedy of genocide and mass deportations in the\r\nOttoman Empire in 1915 and 1923. The first genocide\r\nof the twentieth century unfolded in full force and\r\ncontinued until it had consumed the lives of 1.5 million\r\nArmenians. That genocide witnessed rape, assault,\r\nplunder and the murder of an entire population.\r\nReference was made by the representative of\r\nTurkey to scholars. I have to say that the scholars have\r\ndone their job. The Armenian genocide is well\r\ndocumented in the relevant archives, including the\r\nTurkish, British, American and Russian archives. Let\r\nme just make a few references to those archives. I\r\nwould like to repeat the question here asked by British\r\nForeign Minister Lord Curzon at the Lausanne\r\nConference of 1923, directed at Ismet Pasha, then the\r\nhead of the Turkish delegation. He said:\r\n“There were 3 million Armenians in Asia Minor\r\nbefore the war. Now there are only 130,000.\r\nWhere are the rest? Did they commit suicide or\r\ndisappear voluntarily?”\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nI would also like to make another reference to a\r\ndiplomat of that time. The Ambassador of Germany,\r\nrepresenting a Government allied with Turkey, also\r\nquickly realized what was taking place in 1915. In July\r\n1915, he wrote:\r\n“The Turks began deportations from areas not\r\nthreatened with invasion. This fact, and the\r\nmanner in which the relocation is being carried\r\nout, demonstrate that the Government is really\r\npursuing the aim of destroying the Armenian race\r\nin Turkey.”\r\nBy January 1917, he reported that\r\n“the policy of extermination has largely been\r\nachieved. The current leadership of Turkey fully\r\nsubscribes to this policy.”\r\nAll these archives are available and there is no\r\nneed for scholars to open or to do new research. It has\r\nalready been done. Based on those and other facts,\r\neven back in 1919, the Kemalist court tried and\r\nconvicted a number of high-ranking Young Turk\r\nofficials for their role in what the Turkish Government\r\nthen called the “massacre and destruction” of the\r\nArmenians.\r\nThe Armenian genocide showed that it could be\r\ndone. The policy of genocide pursued by the Ottoman\r\nEmpire went unchecked by other Powers and in time\r\nthe possibility of such a policy encouraged new\r\nbrutalities. The most striking evidence of this was the\r\nnow well-known rhetorical flourish with which Hitler\r\nresponded to the nervous questions of some of his\r\nadvisors vis-à-vis the plans for the invasion of Poland\r\nin 1939: “Who, after all, speaks today of the\r\nannihilation of the Armenians?”\r\nIndeed, there is no national history in a vacuum\r\nand Turkey’s continuing denial of the genocide of the\r\nArmenians in the Ottoman Empire has only intensified\r\nour aspirations to historical justice. Many nations have\r\nfound that there is spiritual or moral resurrection in the\r\nsearch for validation through truth and in facing their\r\nown past squarely. As President Kocharian of Armenia\r\nsaid in this Hall two weeks ago, addressing the\r\nMillennium Summit:\r\n“Penitence is not humiliation; rather, it elevates\r\nindividuals and nations.” (A/55/PV.6)\r\nThe Armenian genocide is an undeniable fact.\r\nWhen the term “genocide” was invented in 1944 to\r\ndescribe the systematic destruction of an entire people,\r\nits author Raphael Lemkin illustrated the term by\r\nsaying it was the “sort of thing that Hitler did to the\r\nJews and the Turks did to the Armenians”.\r\nMany Parliaments of the world have recognized\r\nthe Armenian genocide. A resolution of the European\r\nParliament in 1987 referred to the fact that the\r\nrecognition of the Armenian genocide would be viewed\r\nas a profoundly humane act of moral rehabilitation\r\ntowards the Armenians which could only bring honour\r\nto the Turkish Government. Regretfully, denial, which\r\nhas become an integral part of genocide, often\r\nreinforces the sense of insecurity, abandonment and\r\nbetrayal. But denial is the continuation of genocide;\r\nsome even note that it is the final act of genocide.\r\nI would like to again refer to the statement of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Vartan Oskanian made here this week\r\nas part of the Millennium Assembly general debate. I\r\nwould like to refer in particular to what he said about\r\nhow the South Caucasus region continues to remain\r\nadversely affected by the lack of formal relations\r\nbetween Armenia and our neighbour Turkey. We did\r\nindeed, from day one of our independence, opt for\r\nnormalization of relations and the establishment of\r\ndiplomatic ties. But Turkey insisted and continues to\r\ninsist on certain conditions related to Nagorny\r\nKarabakh and to the recognition of the Armenian\r\ngenocide. The economic blockade imposed by Turkey\r\non Armenia of course negatively affects the peaceful\r\nsolution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict and\r\nseriously hampers the implementation of the most\r\nimportant regional economic programmes.\r\nArmenia remains committed to the peaceful\r\nresolution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict, and we\r\nwill continue to work intensively with the co-chairs of\r\nthe Minsk Group to seek peaceful solutions to the\r\nconflict. We are equally ready to maintain direct\r\ncontact with Azerbaijan, in order to search for a\r\ncompromise.\r\nWe are confident that constructive dialogue with\r\nTurkey, as was mentioned by the Foreign Minister of\r\nArmenia, will allow us to jointly pave a way towards\r\ncooperation and good-neighbourly relations between\r\nour two nations.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): The representative of\r\nEthiopia has raised two issues. The first issue, the\r\nquestion of aggression, was dealt with in previous\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nmeetings, but it does honour to Orwellianism to call the\r\ndefence of territorial integrity aggression.\r\nWe are not talking about the past, but rather the\r\ncommitment to the future. And here it is one’s deeds\r\nand not one’s rhetoric that becomes important.\r\nIt is not unknown to those who have closely\r\nfollowed the peace negotiations — especially the\r\nfacilitators — that the Government of Ethiopia\r\nlaunched a systematic undertaking to subvert and\r\nrender meaningless — indeed to replace outright — the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Framework\r\nAgreement with another agreement, which was not\r\nonly totally alien to, but also contrary to the letter and\r\nspirit of the OAU Framework Agreement and the\r\nmodalities of implementation — which it had\r\npurportedly accepted without any reservations. This\r\ncampaign started in Algiers on the same day, only three\r\nhours after the Algiers agreement was signed, and it\r\nwas pursued during the Washington, D.C., meeting in\r\nearly July.\r\nNot many days after the signing of the Algiers\r\nagreement, the Government of Ethiopia resumed its\r\nharassment, detention, torture, extra-judicial killing\r\nand deportation of innocent Eritreans and Eritreans of\r\nEthiopian origin. Eritrean civilians in sovereign\r\nEritrean territory occupied by Ethiopian forces are\r\nbeing routinely subjected to systematic harassment and\r\nterror tactics, as well as torture, rape, confiscation and\r\ndestruction of homes and property. Fifteen thousand\r\nEritreans were only a few weeks ago expelled from\r\ntheir ancestral places of abode and farms in occupied\r\nEritrean territory. Contrary to the letter and spirit of\r\nboth the OAU Framework Agreement and the Algiers\r\nagreement, the Ethiopian Government has intensified\r\nits malicious ethnic hate campaign against Eritreans\r\nand their Government.\r\nThese are not deeds of peace. These are deeds of\r\nwar. Now it cannot to be denied that the Eritrean\r\nGovernment had undertaken, with the active\r\ncollaboration of the International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross (ICRC), the voluntary repatriation of two\r\ngroups of Ethiopians that had been residing in Eritrea.\r\nThe first group consisted of those Ethiopians who had\r\npeacefully and freely resided in Eritrea for a long time,\r\nuntil they, along with their Eritrean co-inhabitants, had\r\nbeen internally displaced by the invasion and\r\noccupation of Eritrean towns and villages. These\r\npeople were sharing temporary shelters with displaced\r\nEritreans — and sharing the meagre supplies that are\r\nprovided in temporary shelters — and requested the\r\nassistance of both the Eritrean Government and the\r\nICRC so that they could return to Ethiopia. The second\r\ngroup consisted of Ethiopians who did not possess\r\nvalid residency or work permits. They too had\r\nrequested assistance so that they could go home.\r\nThese two groups were interviewed by the ICRC.\r\nThe number of people in both groups was about\r\n11,000. In addition, however, there were very few — a\r\nhandful, really — who had been expelled because they\r\nhad become undesirable aliens. In all instances the\r\nrepatriation strictly adhered to the letter and spirit of\r\nthe procedures and standards established by the ICRC\r\nand recognized by the international community.\r\nNow repatriation took place on the same road by\r\nwhich — only a few days earlier — Ethiopian\r\nauthorities had deported Eritreans and Eritreans of\r\nEthiopian origin. And this repatriation was initially\r\napproved by the Ethiopian Government. There is\r\nincontrovertible evidence that those who had departed\r\nEritrea had arrived in Ethiopia safely, and thus any\r\nstories that may have emanated from Ethiopia about the\r\ndanger on the road or the harm that befell these people\r\ncannot be taken seriously.\r\nThe Ethiopian Government claims that the\r\nEritrean Government was detaining Ethiopians in\r\ncamps. This claim would be too farcical for comment if\r\nit were not a smear campaign. There are no such camps\r\nin Eritrea. Eritrea has throughout the conflict opened\r\nits doors to human rights non-governmental\r\norganizations, such as Amnesty International and\r\nHuman Rights Watch. In any case, since Eritrea signed\r\nthe Geneva Conventions, the ICRC is also — in\r\naddition to its previous regular visits to Ethiopian\r\ncivilians — conducting regular visits to Ethiopian\r\nprisoners of war. Even before Eritrea signed the\r\nGeneva Conventions its record during the liberation\r\nstruggle and afterwards was recognized by these non-\r\ngovernmental organizations as being one of the best.\r\nCan Ethiopia, which signed the Geneva Conventions\r\nonly three years ago — although it is a founding\r\nMember of the United Nations — claim to have such a\r\nrecord? Let the reports of Amnesty International and\r\nHuman Rights Watch serve as witnesses.\r\nMr. Çengizer (Turkey): It is not my intention to\r\ndwell here on our disagreements with Armenia.\r\nHowever, after the remarks of the representative of\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nArmenia I am compelled to say a few brief words in\r\nresponse to just two points.\r\nThe representative of Armenia referred to Lord\r\nCurzon inquiring about Armenians. Again, Lord\r\nCurzon was not an historian. He was a politician. As a\r\nmatter of fact, Lord Curzon had every reason to be a\r\npartisan and partial politician with regard to Turkey.\r\nAfter all, he was negotiating with Turkey in the\r\naftermath of the First World War and in the aftermath\r\nof the triumph of the Turkish struggle.\r\nEspecially — and as a last point — I strongly\r\ndeplore the parallel drawn by the Armenian\r\nrepresentative concerning Hitler. I would like to remind\r\nthe representative of just this: there were no\r\nKristallnachts in Turkey, as there were in Germany.\r\nAnd there were no Jewish armed gangs marauding the\r\nhills of Bavaria and the streets of Berlin, as we had\r\nwith Armenians in Turkey. The historical context is\r\nvastly different, and I really and strongly deplore the\r\ndrawing of this parallel to what Hitler did.\r\nThis concludes my remarks, but I should also say\r\nthat it is our sincere wish, at this turning of the century,\r\nto come to an understanding regarding the tragic\r\nevents. Of course the Armenian side should also refer\r\nto the more than 2 million Turks and Muslims who lost\r\ntheir lives under the same tragic conditions.\r\nMr. Kouliev (Azerbaijan) (spoke in Russian): I\r\nam also compelled to respond to the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of Armenia in which he referred to the\r\nproblem of Nagorny Karabakh. The settlement of the\r\nproblem of Nagorny Karabakh in Azerbaijan is being\r\nhampered primarily, as was already stated, by almost\r\nten years of occupation of 20 per cent of the territory of\r\nAzerbaijan by Armenian armed formations, as a result\r\nof which one out of every eighth inhabitants of my\r\ncountry has become a refugee. Azerbaijan has many\r\ntimes stated that it is committed to a peaceful\r\nsettlement of this conflict, but the Armenian side is\r\nshowing that it does not want to settle this conflict and\r\nis preventing the establishment in the southern\r\nCaucasus of conditions favourable for the development\r\nof relations with neighbouring countries of the region.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia): I very much regret that I\r\nhave to speak again. We did not intend to use even the\r\nfirst right of reply, but we were forced to do so. I will\r\nbe brief. We speak of the commitment to the future. Let\r\nus practise it.\r\nFor the record, Ethiopia signed the Geneva\r\nConvention fifty years ago — not three years ago — as\r\ncan be seen from the record. There is a big difference\r\nbetween fifty and three. An ethnic hate campaign was\r\nmentioned once again. Just listen to the propaganda\r\nthat Ethiopia hears day in and day out in the different\r\nlanguages of Ethiopia from the radio in Asmara and,\r\nunless ethnic hate campaign is to have a different\r\nmeaning, we do not have that, as can be seen from the\r\nfact that we still have at least 400,000 Eritreans living\r\nin Ethiopia, many of them Ethiopian citizens, but half\r\nof them citizens of Eritrea. We have many senior\r\nEthiopians of Eritrean origin in the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment, including the Foreign Ministry, the Prime\r\nMinister’s office, the defence forces and so on. That\r\ndoes not describe a country that is practising an ethnic\r\nhate campaign — it describes a country that has\r\nethnically cleansed all Ethiopians, a campaign that\r\nstarted at a time when we supposedly had good\r\nrelations way back in 1999 before it became\r\nindependent, when thousands of Ethiopians were\r\nunceremoniously kicked out without their property and\r\nmany of them remain interned up to this date.\r\nFinally, only recently in July, the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) testified and\r\nindicated its concern, not orally, but by issuing a press\r\nstatement that can be seen by everybody, whereby they\r\nindicated their concern by the way the Ethiopians in\r\nEritrea were being kicked out over swollen rivers,\r\nareas filled with mines — something I would not call\r\nrepatriation in a very humane way. I do not wish to be\r\npersonal but I find it ironic that these statements are\r\nbeing made by someone — when some of us on this\r\nside were fighting for the democratization of Ethiopia\r\nand also for the rights of the Eritrean people to self-\r\ndetermination — someone who had a very senior post\r\nin the Ethiopian Government and who was opposed to\r\nthe independence of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): I apologize for taking\r\nthe floor once again, but I would like to make a few\r\nadditional comments on the remarks by the\r\nrepresentative of Turkey.\r\nOnce again, the end of the general debate in the\r\nAssembly is not the place to discuss the recognition of\r\nArmenian genocide, but I would like to remind the\r\nrepresentative of Turkey that the Armenian genocide\r\nbegan with the Kristallnacht. That was the first day,\r\n24 April 1915, the first day of genocide when more\r\nthan 300 Armenian intellectuals were brutally\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.28\r\nmurdered by the Turkish authorities, thus signalling the\r\nbeginning of mass annihilation of Armenians in the\r\nOttoman Empire.\r\nI must also remind the representative of Turkey\r\nthat the representative of Armenia did not make a\r\ncomparison, the comparison was made by Rafael\r\nLempkin, and I quoted him. It was Rafael Lempkin\r\nwho introduced the word “genocide”. And the\r\ncomparison of Rafael Lempkin I quote once again: “the\r\nsort of things Hitler did to the Jews and the Turks did\r\nto the Armenians”. The words quoted were not those of\r\nthe representative of Armenia.\r\nThe representative of Turkey also referred to the\r\nfact that two million Turks were killed, but Armenians\r\nwere not involved in those killings, because Armenians\r\nhad already been killed when those events took place.\r\nI wish also to refer to the question of Nagorny\r\nKarabakh. As I said in my previous intervention, I\r\nwould like to repeat, once again, that during the last six\r\nyears, the military phase of the conflict has ceased and\r\nArmenia remains committed to a lasting resolution that\r\nwill provide for peace and security for Nagorny\r\nKarabakh and a continuous link with Armenia and we\r\nwill work intensively with the chairs of the Minsk\r\ngroup for maintaining the ceasefire regime and I\r\nreaffirm we will maintain direct contact with\r\nAzerbaijan in order to search for compromise.\r\nHowever, we think that direct negotiations\r\nbetween Armenia and Nagorny Karabakh will be more\r\nproductive, as it is the people of Nagorny Karabakh\r\nwho will ultimately determine their own destiny.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): Very briefly, on two issues of\r\nfact. The ICRC was involved in almost all of the\r\nvoluntary repatriations that took place. When it was\r\nnot, it could not do so because the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment refused to cooperate and those who\r\nbenefited from voluntary repatriation could not benefit\r\nfrom ICRC assistance. The report by the ICRC resident\r\nin Ethiopia, which was mentioned by the representative\r\nof Ethiopia with regard to occurrences in Eritrea, has\r\nactually been repudiated by the Headquarters of the\r\nICRC.\r\nFinally, I will not indulge myself by answering ad\r\nhominem arguments. Ad hominem arguments are the\r\ntactics of the weak defending the bankrupt policies of\r\nan immoral and illegitimate regime.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.45 p.m.\r\n"
