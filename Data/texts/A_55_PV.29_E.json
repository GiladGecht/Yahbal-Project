(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/55/1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nSecretary-General presented his report to the General\r\nAssembly at the 10th plenary meeting on 12 September\r\n2000.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): At the outset, I would like\r\nto commend the Secretary-General for his excellent\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/55/1) to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFurthermore, in his opening statement to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Secretary-General pointed out\r\nthat the time has come to roll up our sleeves and start\r\nputting into action the bold pledges our “captains and\r\nkings” made during the Millennium Summit. I can\r\nassure you that my Government strongly shares this\r\nsentiment and that we will work with you and our\r\nfellow delegates to make this noble goal come true.\r\nAmong its important messages, the report\r\nhighlights — and thus concurs with the Millennium\r\nDeclaration — the fact that the elimination of poverty\r\nmust be our first priority among the many pledges to be\r\nfulfilled. The fight to eliminate poverty is an overriding\r\nchallenge, and there has been considerable progress in\r\naddressing this issue. But half of the world’s\r\npopulation still must try to survive on less than two\r\ndollars a day.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Secretary-General\r\nin his report focuses on girls’ education as a critical\r\nfactor in the eradication of poverty. We hope the launch\r\nof the informal task force in April will increase the\r\nefforts undertaken within the United Nations system to\r\npromote girls’ education. The fight against poverty,\r\nunderdevelopment and environmental degradation must\r\nbe at the top of our agenda.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral points out, has become a serious development\r\ncrisis. In many countries the epidemic has had dramatic\r\nconsequences, and there is a need for additional\r\nfinancial resources and development assistance to\r\ncombat the virus. My Government welcomes the fact\r\nthat an inter-agency task force chaired by the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO) has developed a strategy\r\nfor improving the access of AIDS victims to anti-AIDS\r\ndrugs. Norway has been a major contributor to health\r\nprogrammes related to HIV/AIDS, and we will\r\ncontinue to support these programmes. Recently the\r\nNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation\r\nmade approximately $5 million available to the WHO\r\nfor health programmes in Africa.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General also draws\r\nparticular attention to the importance of conflict\r\nprevention. In particular, we welcome his emphasis on\r\nstrengthening the United Nations early warning and\r\nconflict prevention capacities. But we must all make\r\nthe efforts needed to provide sufficient regular budget\r\nfunding for the conflict prevention efforts of the United\r\nNations.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nThe success of these efforts will, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral points out, hinge upon close collaboration with\r\nMember States, regional organizations and others. We\r\nhave witnessed significant successes, but we have also\r\nduring the last ten years uncovered disturbing and\r\ntragic weaknesses. We must learn from failures of the\r\npast, and improved coordination of our efforts can\r\ncontribute to a better understanding of both the\r\nproblems and the solutions.\r\nNorway therefore supports the recommendations\r\nin the report of the United Nations Panel on Peace\r\nOperations headed by Ambassador Brahimi. Norway\r\nstands ready to engage in a broad dialogue on how to\r\nensure the speedy and efficient implementation of\r\nrecommendations in the Brahimi Report (A/55/305).\r\nThe conflicts in East Timor and Sierra Leone\r\ncontinue to cause immeasurable suffering for hundreds\r\nof thousands of people and place burdens upon the\r\nresponse system of the United Nations. I am happy to\r\nnote that the United Nations still is intensely involved\r\nin the efforts to find solutions to these conflicts, in\r\nclose cooperation with other organizations.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General deals\r\nextensively with the situation in Africa. As outlined by\r\nthe Secretary-General, the United Nations is involved\r\nin a large number of development programmes and\r\nother activities in Africa. Progress is, however,\r\ndependent on resources that in too many cases are\r\nscarce. Norway agrees with the Secretary-General that\r\nAfrica’s problems must remain of the highest priority\r\nfor the Organization.\r\nImportant reforms of the Organization have been\r\nimplemented, and we appreciate the fact that the\r\nSecretary-General is dedicated to pursuing the reform\r\nprocess further. In these efforts he can rely on the full\r\nsupport of Norway.\r\nMr. Ryan (Ireland): I welcome this\r\ncomprehensive and stimulating report from the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of our Organization\r\n(A/55/1). In his introduction he notes that the turn of\r\nthe millennium provides a unique vantage point from\r\nwhich to view humanity’s progress and challenges. In\r\nfact, the Secretary-General himself was the driving\r\nforce behind ensuring that we made full use of this\r\nvantage point at the Millennium Summit.\r\nHis challenging report to the Summit, the superb\r\norganization and the opportunity it gave to our leaders\r\nto interact with each other and to develop a common\r\nvision for the twenty-first century all provided the most\r\neffective possible starting point for a new era of\r\ncooperation in addressing our common problems and\r\nachieving our common goals. It is now up to us, the\r\nmembership, to take up these challenges and do justice\r\nto this vision. The Millennium Summit is not, of\r\ncourse, covered in the report before us, but my\r\ndelegation does not want the occasion to pass without\r\noffering our congratulations and appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General and his team.\r\nIn this millennium year, it is appropriate that we\r\nlook back as well as forward. Nowhere is this more\r\ntrue than in the central task of conflict prevention and\r\npeacekeeping. The reports on the United Nations\r\nreaction to unfolding events in Srebrenica and in\r\nRwanda revealed serious inadequacies and showed how\r\nthese inadequacies contributed to the tragedies which\r\ntook place. Experience in Sierra Leone has also been\r\nsalutary.\r\nWe must be clear on one thing. This is our\r\nOrganization, and if it has been shown to have been\r\nwanting in meeting its challenges, we all share the\r\nresponsibility. If the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations must maintain nearly 40,000 troops on 15\r\ndifferent peacekeeping missions with a totally\r\ninadequate Headquarters staff, if United Nations troops\r\nare placed in the field without the necessary training or\r\nequipment, if United Nations troops are forced to stand\r\nby powerlessly while atrocities are committed and if\r\ncommunications are inadequate, we are all responsible\r\nto some degree, and it is incumbent on all of us to\r\nengage in the search for solutions.\r\nThe United Nations cannot work miracles. We\r\nhave seen over the past year that if protagonists are\r\ndetermined to resolve their differences through conflict\r\nthen they will do so. But the reports on past tragedies\r\nshow that the United Nations can do much more to\r\nprevent conflict and maintain peace if certain problems\r\nare addressed. The Secretary-General has not just given\r\nus a challenge; he has also given us a framework in\r\nwhich to address these problems. I am referring, of\r\ncourse, to the report (A/55/305) of the Panel on United\r\nNations Peace Operations chaired by Lakhdar Brahimi.\r\nMy authorities are fully prepared to take up that\r\nchallenge, and we intend to participate actively in the\r\nprocess of ensuring the successful implementation of\r\nthe key recommendations of the Brahimi report.\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nLast year, the strengthening of early warning\r\nmechanisms was a particular theme of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. Since then, there have been some\r\nimportant developments. The Secretary-General, in his\r\nreport, refers to the Prevention Team that has been\r\nestablished by the Department of Political Affairs, and\r\nto the strengthening of the capacity of other\r\ndepartments and agencies in this area, as well as to the\r\nnew interdepartmental Framework for Coordination.\r\nThe Security Council too has paid close attention\r\nto conflict prevention over the past 12 months, with\r\ntwo open debates and the adoption of comprehensive\r\npresidential statements. United Nations cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations has been stepped up.\r\nEfforts have been made to tap the potential of non-\r\ngovernmental actors. However, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral points out, United Nations efforts in that\r\ndirection require leadership and resources, and\r\ntherefore political will on the part of the membership.\r\nThe report makes clear how much of our efforts\r\nin that direction must still be directed at the continent\r\nof Africa. Conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-\r\nconflict peace-building by the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and subregional organizations, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, remain vital if\r\ncurrent conflicts are to be brought to a close, further\r\nconflicts prevented and conditions created for peaceful\r\ndevelopment. I am convinced that the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, in cooperation with the OAU and\r\nsubregional organizations and with individual\r\nmediators, will ultimately prove successful in Sierra\r\nLeone, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Somalia and Angola, and that they will, over\r\ntime, help Ethiopia and Eritrea to heal the wounds of\r\nwar and to re-establish fraternal relations.\r\nOutside Africa, the United Nations contribution\r\nwas essential in the resolution of situations which had\r\ngot out of hand, in particular Kosovo and East Timor.\r\nDelegations will understand if I welcome in particular\r\nthe Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolution 425\r\n(1978). My country has been intensively involved with\r\nthe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)\r\nfor 22 years, an involvement which brought much\r\nsacrifice in human lives, but also much satisfaction,\r\nnever more so than during the past few months. I\r\nwould like to echo the Secretary-General’s call for\r\nfurther efforts in the search for a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\r\nThe Secretary-General correctly observes that\r\ndisarmament is a critical element of the United Nations\r\nstrategy for peace and security, and also that, despite\r\nsome progress, deep concern remains at the risk posed\r\nby nuclear weapons. One particularly positive event\r\nwas the successful outcome of the Review Conference\r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, to which the New Agenda coalition,\r\nof which Ireland was a founding member, made a\r\ncritical contribution.\r\nLooking to next year’s United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in all its Aspects, the Secretary-General\r\npoints out that these are the weapons that kill most\r\npeople in most wars. All too often, these weapons are\r\nin the hands of children. It is time that the control of\r\ntrade in these arms was made a matter of international\r\ntreaty, and my authorities call on all concerned to\r\ncooperate with the Secretary-General in making a\r\nsuccess of the Conference.\r\nThe Secretary-General affirms his conviction that\r\nthriving markets and human security go hand in hand,\r\nbut he cautions that globalization must be made more\r\ninclusive and that its benefits must be spread more\r\nequitably. If poverty is to be reduced and ultimately\r\neliminated – and that must remain our common goal –\r\nthen adequate development financing must be\r\navailable. The Secretary-General is right when he says\r\nthat the benefits of globalization will bypass those who\r\nare unable to attract private capital unless official\r\ndevelopment assistance is maintained and increased.\r\nThat is why my Prime Minister made a very\r\nprecise, transparent and quantifiable commitment at the\r\nMillennium Summit: Ireland will increase its level of\r\nofficial development assistance so as to reach the\r\nUnited Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct by the year 2007. That is why Ireland has\r\nconsistently increased its contribution to United\r\nNations funds and programmes, with emphasis on their\r\ncore activities. That is why Ireland has consistently\r\ncontributed to the relief of debt and why it will\r\ncontinue to do so, even though it does not itself hold\r\nany debt, all of its assistance being in grant form.\r\nBut development must also be sustainable and, as\r\nthe Secretary-General points out in the report before\r\nus, the challenges in achieving sustainability are\r\ncomplex and multifaceted. Development in our own\r\ngeneration must take place in a manner which ensures\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nthat future generations will inherit an environment that\r\nwill allow them to meet their needs. My authorities\r\nbelieve firmly in the need for a tool with which to\r\nmeasure the risks faced by countries in the face of\r\nenvironmental pressures. A solid and practicable\r\nenvironmental vulnerability index would be of great\r\nvalue to many Member States, and especially to the\r\nsmall island developing States, whose very existence is\r\nthreatened by climate change. For that reason, Ireland\r\nis funding a technical study for the development of\r\nsuch an index, in line with the Secretary-General’s call\r\nfor innovative and practical solutions to the problems\r\ninvolved in the search for sustainable development.\r\nThe work of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment is particularly crucial. It is essential that\r\nevery effort be made over the next two years to ensure\r\na successful outcome of the 10-year review of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment — the Rio Conference.\r\nFinally, I would like to draw one further point\r\nfrom the Secretary-General’s report. He says that\r\nGovernments, international institutions, civil society\r\nand the private business sector all gain from\r\ncooperation, because each achieves through\r\ncooperation what none could achieve alone. During this\r\npast year, up to and including the Millennium Summit,\r\nwe have seen very significant progress in defining the\r\ncommon goals that we want to achieve. I am confident\r\nthat, working together in the United Nations, we will\r\nsucceed in reconciling our individual interests in the\r\npursuit of these common goals.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwould like at the outset to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor preparing and presenting his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization, contained in document A/55/1. At the\r\nfifty-fourth session, my delegation expressed its\r\npositions and participated in the debate and\r\nconsideration of many of the issues addressed in that\r\nreport. We shall be taking the same approach during the\r\nfifty-fifth session, and will be stating our\r\nGovernment’s positions and concerns throughout the\r\nyear.\r\nThe Millennium Summit celebrations are behind\r\nus and we now need to begin, during our Millennium\r\nAssembly, to implement the Millennium Declaration\r\nproposals. We are certain that in our deliberations we\r\nwill give them our full consideration, always avoiding\r\ngiving priority to some over others of equal or more\r\nimportance, particularly to developing countries.\r\nI wish to share some preliminary thoughts on\r\ndocument A/55/1. We are aware of the considerable\r\nchallenges in the area of peace and security. In\r\nparagraph 64, in particular, the need to resolve the\r\nconflict prevailing in my country is recognized. The\r\nGovernment of Colombia continues to be committed to\r\nseeking a political solution to a conflict that has lasted\r\nfor more than 40 years, and requests the solidarity and\r\npersistence of the international community to achieve\r\nit. We will continue to work very closely with the\r\nSecretary-General’s Special Adviser on International\r\nAssistance to Colombia, being convinced that progress\r\ntowards attaining peace will be reflected in substantial\r\nimprovements in the human rights situation.\r\nWith regard to the maintenance and consideration\r\nof peace, the basis of our discussions will be the\r\nBrahimi report (A/55/305) on peace operations. The\r\nreport has been positively received by Member States,\r\nand there is general agreement on the need to make\r\nprompt decisions on its proposals, which will affect the\r\nfuture of the United Nations. However, we must bear in\r\nmind, first, that the General Assembly is the only organ\r\nthat can give those decisions the international\r\nlegitimacy needed to ensure their effectiveness;\r\nsecondly, that it will be inconvenient to act on the basis\r\nof rigid timetables that subject these decisions to\r\nunnecessary time pressures; and, thirdly, that the\r\nBrahimi report is one of many documents containing\r\nrecommendations, and therefore should be evaluated\r\nwith the same consideration as other reports, such as\r\nthat prepared by the Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations (A/51/130)\r\nThe fulfilment of humanitarian commitments\r\nmentioned in the Secretary-General’s report must be\r\nthrough a cautious balance that takes into account the\r\nlimitations of the United Nations system, the need to\r\nrespect the sovereignty of all States and the\r\ninnumerable demands made by a humanitarian crisis. It\r\nis essential that we establish in all cases systems for\r\ncooperation and communication with national\r\nGovernments willing to participate in preventing and\r\novercoming humanitarian crises.\r\nDevelopment issues are of particular concern to\r\nColombia. There is a proliferation of diagnoses of the\r\nsituation in the South, such as those presented in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report and in other reports\r\nsubmitted throughout the year. However, they lack\r\nrecommendations on the collective and individual\r\naction necessary to ensure the fulfilment of the\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nobjectives in the Millennium Declaration. This matter\r\nmerits more careful and balanced consideration\r\nadequately taking into account the responsibilities of\r\nthe North and the South.\r\nI conclude with a reflection on the beneficiaries\r\nof the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Our consideration of the future of the United\r\nNations must begin with an evaluation of the past\r\nwithin the international system. Which countries have\r\nbeen the great beneficiaries of the past? To what extent\r\nhave the developing countries been the great losers of\r\nthe past? Clearly, we developing countries have\r\nreceived important benefits from the existence of the\r\nUnited Nations. However, it is also clear that they have\r\nnot been enough. We then ask ourselves: How can we\r\nensure that the beneficiaries of the future include the\r\npeoples of the developing world? Many of the concerns\r\nand the challenges mentioned by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report directly involve the South — our\r\ncountries. We are interested in the debate; we will\r\nparticipate in it; and we hope to keep alive the\r\nexchange begun in recent months so that the solutions\r\nalso involve our countries.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, my delegation wishes to express its great\r\nappreciation for the excellent and dedicated efforts of\r\nthe Secretary-General in managing and administering\r\nthe work of our Organization, as it has gone through\r\ndifficult circumstances at the end of the last century, a\r\ncentury that witnessed many international problems.\r\nWe congratulate him on the success of the Millennium\r\nSummit and its results, hoping that all States will\r\nrespect their commitments in order to ensure the\r\nsuccess and efficiency of our Organization in the new\r\ncentury.\r\nOur delegation has studied the content of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report submitted to us today. The\r\nreader of the report comes away with two realities. One\r\nis that we as Governments and peoples find the role of\r\nthe United Nations indispensable in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security and in facing the\r\nchallenges connected to those issues. Secondly, the\r\ntasks of the United Nations have become extremely\r\ncomplex and all-inclusive, to the extent that it has\r\nbecome very difficult to separate issues of security and\r\ndevelopment and issues of political stability and\r\neconomic prosperity.\r\nOur delegation agrees with practically everything\r\nin the report, but we wish to make the following\r\ncomments.\r\nFirst, the issues connected with the establishment\r\nof international peace and security are the most pivotal\r\ntasks of the United Nations. We fully agree that those\r\nissues should be given prominence in the annual\r\nreports submitted by the Secretary-General, because\r\nthey are closely connected to the economic and social\r\nproblems we face today.\r\nSecondly, the concept of collective security and\r\nthe idea of conflict prevention should include all the\r\ninternational problems and issues we face, because, in\r\nthe final analysis, they will affect the security of\r\nhumanity as a whole, and that necessitates the\r\nconsensus of all parties and respect for the sovereignty\r\nof all States.\r\nThirdly, Kuwait welcomes the explanation given\r\nby the Secretary-General concerning progress in\r\npeacekeeping operations. We also welcome the report\r\nof Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi (A/55/305),\r\nconcerning his assessment of peace operations and the\r\nneed to promote them as a major tool for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. We call upon the\r\nGeneral Assembly to deal with his Panel’s\r\nrecommendations very seriously. Kuwait fully\r\nunderstands the importance of peacekeeping\r\noperations, since the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\r\nObserver Mission (UNIKOM) plays an important role\r\nin maintaining peace and stability on our international\r\nborder with Iraq, a fact that led us to voluntarily\r\ncontribute two thirds of the budget of this force.\r\nFourthly, Kuwait believes that the problems of\r\npoverty and disease, which are claiming so many\r\nvictims, have been around for a long time and are not,\r\nas is being said today, the result of globalization.\r\nSuccessfully confronting the dangers of poverty and\r\ndisease calls for efficient action, which should begin\r\nwith initiatives at the State level, which could then be\r\ncombined with those of other States to become a\r\ncollective and organized action.\r\nFifthly, Kuwait fully agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s position on sanctions, as expressed in his\r\nreport on the work of the Organization and the report to\r\nthe Millennium Summit. We, like others, express deep\r\nsympathy for the peoples who suffer as a result of\r\nsanctions. At the same time, however, our sympathy\r\nshould not go out to regimes that control the destiny of\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\npeople under sanctions or that profit from sanctions.\r\nSuch regimes have been characterized as tyrannical and\r\ndictatorial in both reports of the Secretary-General.\r\nSanctions should act precisely against those regimes to\r\nforce them to reform their policies. The international\r\ncommunity’s sympathy should go out to suffering\r\npeople, not to their rulers.\r\nSixthly, our delegation shares the concern\r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization over the continued non-\r\ncompliance by the Iraqi Government with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and specifically over its\r\nrejection of resolution 1284 (1999). In connection with\r\nparagraphs 54 and 55 of the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nwe also share the concern over that Government’s\r\nrefusal to cooperate with the high-level coordinator to\r\nsolve the problem of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and\r\nKuwaiti property. We endorse those two paragraphs as\r\nthey reflect the neutrality and objectivity of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan. Those qualities have always led\r\nus to trust him when dealing with international\r\nproblems of common interest.\r\nIt is also important to draw the attention of\r\nMember States to the fact that showing concern for\r\npeople’s suffering by expressing sympathy requires\r\ncredibility so that such concern covers the sufferings of\r\nother peoples who may simultaneously be the cause\r\nand victims of suffering. Showing concern for the\r\nsuffering of one people but not for another exposes\r\npolitical aims that have nothing to do with\r\ninternationally accepted humanitarian principles, which\r\nare intrinsic to every human being.\r\nIt is for that reason that Kuwait continues to\r\nappeal to Member States to call directly on the Iraqi\r\nGovernment to solve the problem of Kuwaiti and third-\r\nparty prisoners of war, and to end the suffering of their\r\nfamilies who have been enduring it for over 10 years.\r\nWe reaffirm the fact that solving these problems\r\nrequires political determination on the part of Iraq to\r\nstop relying on political pretexts that only serve to\r\nperpetuate the suffering of innocent people. Every\r\nregional organization — namely, the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil, the League of Arab States, the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference — has called on Iraq to solve this\r\nhumanitarian problem. We hope that the Iraqi\r\nGovernment will respond to those appeals.\r\nIn conclusion, we in Kuwait would like to\r\nreaffirm our support for the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral as the leader of the Organization. We firmly\r\nbelieve that without the support and cooperation of\r\nMember States, the United Nations will not succeed in\r\nmeeting the challenges of the new century. We stress\r\nthe need to concentrate on economic and social\r\nchallenges. A careful reading of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report to the Millennium Summit and an\r\nexamination of the statistics on the victims of poverty,\r\nAIDS and drug abuse indicate that these matters cry\r\nout for sincere policies and full cooperation, as well as\r\na rejection of conflict and individual interests. Failing\r\nto do so will deprive our generation and future\r\ngenerations of any enjoyment of the life granted to us\r\nby God the Almighty. That would be sheer selfishness.\r\nMr. Satoh (Japan): At the outset, I would like to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of\r\nthe presidency of the Millennium Assembly. My\r\ndelegation is prepared to cooperate with you in the\r\ncourse of this important session.\r\nThe Millennium Summit was a great success. The\r\nMillennium Declaration, which was adopted by a\r\nconsensus among all the leaders of the world\r\nparticipating at the Summit, has set forth clear\r\nguidelines for the role of the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century. Of course, holding the Summit\r\nand adopting the Declaration are not ends in\r\nthemselves but, rather, mark a new starting point. It is\r\nnow the responsibility of all Member States to work for\r\nthe realization of the goals set forth in that historic\r\ndocument.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization provides a useful guide for our\r\nefforts in that regard. I would like to express our deep\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for producing\r\nthat valuable report. Today, I would like to touch upon\r\nthree issues.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to stress anew the\r\nimportance of strengthening the United Nations, and\r\nthe Security Council in particular. As Japan’s Prime\r\nMinister, Yoshiro Mori, and its Foreign Minister, Yohei\r\nKono, made clear in their respective statements to the\r\nSummit and in the general debate, the Security Council\r\nmust be reformed so that it reflects the realities of\r\ntoday’s international community. In this context, it is\r\nindeed encouraging to note that during the course of\r\nthose meetings, more than 150 countries stressed the\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nurgent need for Security Council reform. Moreover, it\r\nis our understanding that as many as 70 countries\r\nspecifically underlined the need to expand both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of\r\nmembership.\r\nThe Secretary-General was right when he stressed\r\nin his concluding remarks to world leaders at the\r\nSummit that\r\n“Almost everyone one of you has called for a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nThat surely must give new impetus to the search\r\nfor consensus on this thorny but unavoidable\r\nissue.” (A/55/PV.8)\r\nWe must now redouble our efforts in order to achieve\r\nSecurity Council reform, building upon the momentum\r\ngenerated by our leaders at that historic Summit.\r\nAs we all know, financial reform is also a task\r\nwhich requires our special efforts at this session. In\r\norder to place this valuable Organization on a sound\r\nand firm financial basis, it is essential to make the\r\nscale of assessments for the regular budget more\r\nequitable. And, given that requirements for\r\npeacekeeping operations are expected to increase, it is\r\nalso important to attain more balanced budget sharing\r\nin the financing of peacekeeping operations. It is, I\r\nbelieve, the responsibility of all Member States to\r\naddress this issue with a sense of urgency.\r\nThe Japanese Government welcomes the report\r\n(A/55/305) of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations, and I applaud the efforts of Ambassador\r\nLakhdar Brahimi and the other members of the Panel\r\nwho produced this important document, which contains\r\nmany useful suggestions.\r\nWe are in full agreement with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s assertion on 12 September that we should\r\nconsider expeditiously the recommendations of the\r\nPanel. Japan, for its part, places particular importance\r\non strengthening the functions of the United Nations\r\nSecretariat with respect to making its operations more\r\neffective. In this connection, we look forward to the\r\nearly presentation by the Secretary-General of an\r\nimplementation plan. We will participate in the\r\ndeliberations on implementation in a forward-looking\r\nmanner.\r\nFinally, I would like to underscore anew the\r\nimportance of human security, or a human-centred\r\napproach, in addressing the issues which the\r\ninternational community is now facing. As Prime\r\nMinister Mori stressed at the Summit, it is essential\r\nthat we give priority to the protection of life and\r\ndignity of people when we tackle the problems before\r\nus, which include poverty, environmental degradation,\r\nconflicts, human rights violations, refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, AIDS and other infectious diseases.\r\nIn this context, I strongly endorse the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, which stressed the importance\r\nof human security in various contexts. Recognizing\r\nthat the United Nations should play a more active role\r\nin promoting a human-centred approach to various\r\nproblems, Japan has to date contributed more than $80\r\nmillion to the Human Security Fund, whose creation\r\nwas proposed by the late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.\r\nI am pleased to remind the Assembly that Prime\r\nMinister Mori announced at the Millennium Summit\r\nthat the Japanese Government would make a further\r\ncontribution of approximately $100 million to this\r\nFund. We sincerely hope that the Fund will add to the\r\nwillingness and capacity of the international\r\ncommunity to enhance human security as it addresses a\r\nbroad range of issues in the coming years.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): The Millennium\r\nSummit and the general debate which has just\r\nconcluded gave pre-eminence as never before to man’s\r\nquest for a more equitable distribution of wealth. The\r\nhalls of this Assembly are echoing the concern and\r\nanger of the least developed countries, the small island\r\nStates and the developing States in general, about the\r\nwidening gap between rich and poor, the negative\r\nimpact of globalization, the unsustainable debt burden,\r\nthe inexcusable and unacceptable loss of life from\r\ncurable diseases, such as malaria, while HIV/AIDS,\r\nwhich plagues especially the African States, is\r\nspreading with frightening speed in other parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nIt was correctly stated that we live in a world of\r\nabundance but with extreme poverty right on our\r\ndoorsteps. The urgent need for action has never been\r\nhighlighted as it was during the Millennium Summit,\r\nand at the highest representative level. The Declaration\r\nof this historic Summit, setting specific goals for the\r\neradication of curable diseases and for combating\r\nextreme poverty, are realistic. What is needed is\r\ndetermination for action to make the Summit’s promise\r\na reality, as the Secretary-General stated.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nWe agree with the assessment that, in the fight\r\nagainst poverty and the negative effects of\r\nglobalization, favourable trade terms, foreign\r\ninvestment and increased official development\r\nassistance are of paramount importance. What is more,\r\nwe believe that international institutions could assist by\r\nbeing more receptive to the special problems and\r\nspecial needs of a number of developing States.\r\nExtreme poverty and poverty in general, beyond\r\nthe suffering they cause, are a source of the\r\ndeterioration of the environment; they breed crime and\r\nare the root causes of conflicts. “Hungry people”, said\r\none speaker, “wake up angry people”. We must try to\r\nimplement the 1990s agenda commitment on\r\ndevelopment, especially now, after the reinforcement\r\nof those commitments by the Millennium Summit\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report concedes that\r\nmany States have serious and legitimate concerns about\r\nintervention, and goes on to pose the question:\r\n“if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an\r\nunacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should\r\nwe respond to … gross and systematic violations\r\nof human rights … ?” (A/55/1, para. 37)\r\nWe are among the many that share the concerns to\r\nwhich the Secretary-General referred.\r\nWe hold that the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nsigned by 189 sovereign Member States, bestowed on\r\nthe Security Council primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and\r\ngranted to it the authority to employ coercive\r\nmeasures, including the use of force, when threats or\r\nbreaches of peace and security occur. Except in cases\r\nof self-defence, covered in Article 51 of the Charter,\r\nany use of armed force by any State for the solution\r\nof international problems is absolutely and\r\nunambiguously prohibited.\r\nThe Security Council remains the sole source of\r\nthe legitimate use of armed force when dealing with\r\nbreaches of peace and, of course, when systematic and\r\ngross violations of human rights are involved.\r\nWe cannot supersede or substitute these Charter\r\nprovisions, for there is no alternative to the Security\r\nCouncil’s legality in the use of armed force. What is\r\nmore, there is no other international instrument which\r\nenjoys, as the Charter does, the unanimous support of\r\nmankind. Despite its more than five decades of\r\nexistence, the Charter is as relevant as ever and\r\nindispensable — even more so today. What is needed is\r\nstrict adherence to its provisions by all.\r\nIf we accept intervention outside the United\r\nNations framework, it may also encourage militant\r\nseparatists to create conditions of bloodshed that are\r\nconducive to intervention. Even where the Security\r\nCouncil fails to agree to the use of armed force, there\r\nare other remedies which the Council may agree to\r\nemploy. The founding fathers, in Article 41 of the\r\nCharter, gave us a list of coercive measures not\r\ninvolving the use of armed force that the Council may\r\nadopt. The coming into full operation of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is an added restraint to\r\nhuman rights violations.\r\nIf the measures provided for in Article 41 prove\r\ninadequate, then the problem may be brought for\r\ndeliberation before the General Assembly, which is the\r\nmost representative main organ of the United Nations.\r\nWe must not forget also that States have the primary\r\nresponsibility for safeguarding the human rights of\r\ntheir people.\r\nRespect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of States and non-interference in their internal\r\naffairs cannot be and must not be interpreted as an\r\nimpediment to safeguarding human rights or justifying\r\ninaction when systematic and gross violations of\r\nhuman rights occur. To the contrary, when the action to\r\nbe taken enjoys the legality of a United Nations\r\nmandate, the chances are that it will meet its goals in\r\nredressing grave violations of human rights.\r\nThe use of armed force, motivated by good\r\nintentions but in violation of provisions of the Charter\r\nregarding respect for the sovereignty of States, is no\r\nsolution. It is a cause of more problems to come. If we\r\nallow well-intentioned interventions outside the United\r\nNations framework, we will be opening a Pandora’s\r\nbox, for, as we said before, there will always be leaders\r\nwho, under the pretext of the humanitarian protection\r\nof the rights of peoples, minorities or ethnic\r\ncommunities, will use aggression for expansionist\r\nreasons. Paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the Charter\r\nprohibits such use of force.\r\nThe subject of humanitarian intervention is both\r\ncrucial and challenging and needs thorough discussion\r\nwithin and outside the United Nations. We therefore\r\nwelcome the Canadian initiative on the subject.\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nAs to other issues raised in the report,\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations and civil society should be further\r\nstrengthened, while the cooperation of the United\r\nNations with the private sector, a potent partner, could\r\nreap many benefits for mankind, especially in the\r\ndomain of the environment, when well monitored and\r\nCharter-oriented.\r\nAs to reforms, we believe that an enlarged\r\nSecurity Council reflecting the realities of today’s\r\nworld would also better serve the interests of peace and\r\nsecurity. It is time to turn this widely shared position\r\ninto practice.\r\nOn the question of sanctions, we believe that\r\nthere is room for improvement and share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s view that the administration of sanctions\r\nmust be geared to minimizing their negative effects on\r\ncivilian populations and neighbouring States.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to express\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his report in\r\ndocument A/55/1 and for the ideas, suggestions and\r\nrecommendations he has provided us as food for\r\nthought. We fully support the advice of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the need to implement the goals of the\r\nDeclaration of the Millennium Summit. We especially\r\nvalue his solemn warning never to leave the United\r\nNations without resources to protect those who have\r\nplaced their trust in it.\r\nMr. Pradhan (Bhutan): My delegation would\r\nlike to add its voice to those commending the\r\nSecretary-General on his report on the work of our\r\nOrganization. With this document and his earlier report\r\nto the Millennium Summit, we have a comprehensive\r\nview of the ongoing activities of the United Nations\r\nand the possible actions that Members could initiate\r\ntowards implementing the goals of the Charter. In the\r\ninterest of brevity, my delegation would like to\r\ncomment on only a few of the issues in the report.\r\nThe Secretary-General has not only envisioned\r\nthe United Nations as a forum in which national\r\nGovernments may work together, but over the years\r\nhas made impressive inroads in involving private\r\ncorporations, civil society and labour organizations in\r\nplaying a role in promoting the goals of the United\r\nNations Charter. His Global Compact initiative has\r\nbeen an important step in this direction. My delegation\r\ncommends the Secretary-General and we ask him to\r\ncontinue his laudable work. It is now quite clear that\r\nsuch important sections of international society, which\r\nhave so much influence on the lives of people across\r\nthe globe, can be of great help in supporting our work\r\nhere in this universal body.\r\nPeacekeeping and peace-building are obviously\r\nvital and, as can be seen from the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, these activities are expanding in scope. My\r\ndelegation appreciates the many achievements of our\r\nOrganization. We are also aware that the tasks are\r\nsometimes difficult and that failures loom large.\r\nThough peacekeeping and peace-building are of great\r\nimportance and necessary to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, there is a need to take\r\nan objective look into the necessary and\r\nnot-so-necessary activities with a view to keeping\r\noperational costs minimal and affordable. In this\r\ncontext, the Brahimi report is welcome and needs to be\r\nlooked into and given due consideration.\r\nMy delegation was heartened to see the\r\nSecretary-General touching upon issues related to\r\ncooperation for development in his report. The great\r\nneed of the hour, in order to fulfil the decisions taken\r\nby the international community, is to reverse the\r\ndeclining trend in disbursements of official\r\ndevelopment assistance. The least developed countries\r\nhave been calling for the fulfilment of the target 0.15\r\nper cent of gross national product for official\r\ndevelopment assistance from the target 0.7 gross\r\nnational product agreed upon for all developing\r\ncountries. We request the Secretary-General to\r\ncontinue to impress upon the developed countries the\r\nneed to recommit themselves to this important goal and\r\nto fulfil the target in the interest of tackling poverty\r\nand to further international cooperation in\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has emphasized, social\r\nand economic development has to be accompanied by\r\ngood governance and be people-centred. With the\r\nexpanding world population, which is expected to rise\r\nto 10 billion by 2030, we are deeply concerned by the\r\npressures of population movements. This phenomenon\r\ncould undermine the very foundations of nations and\r\ndisrupt the hard-earned successes of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment achieved over decades. National\r\nGovernments must not only take active and effective\r\nsteps to control population growth, but also provide\r\ngood governance and create the social and economic\r\nconditions to look after the welfare of their peoples.\r\nOtherwise, the peace and security of regions can be\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nseriously undermined. This is an aspect that needs to be\r\ngiven more emphasis by Members and by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Secretary-General has mentioned that he has\r\nreceived considerable support for the proposals made\r\nin his report to the Millennium Summit. My delegation\r\nsees this especially in the case of cooperation in\r\neconomic development, and we are heartened to know\r\nof this widespread acceptance of the views put forward\r\nin his report. But verbal support is one thing and actual\r\naction another. The Secretary-General has rightly\r\npointed this out and has called on Member States to go\r\nbeyond verbal statements and, instead, begin to take\r\nconcrete action. My delegation supports this call of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nMr. Schumacher (Germany): On behalf of my\r\nGovernment, I would like to express my appreciation\r\nand respect for the work the United Nations has done\r\nduring the last 12 months — a year in which another 17\r\npeople have lost their lives in the line of United\r\nNations duty in different international theatres, many\r\nof them in acts of violence with the culprits never\r\nhaving been brought to justice. This alone is a sombre\r\nreminder that the international community is still far\r\nfrom reaching its ambitious goals of peaceful and\r\nprosperous cooperation for the good of mankind.\r\nThe Millennium Summit, its final Declaration and\r\nthe ensuing general debate have again provided a sharp\r\nanalysis of the world’s inequities and injustices, and\r\nmany political declarations of intent on how to\r\novercome them. True and immediate action to remedy\r\nthese problems is still desperately needed. The\r\nSecretary-General’s comprehensive and valuable report\r\nshows the enormous efforts the United Nations has\r\nmade to meet the manifold challenges. Let us join the\r\nSecretariat in highlighting concrete actions that we, the\r\nMember States, are undertaking to support and advance\r\nthe same endeavour.\r\nI will thus focus on two points only. The first is\r\nour — that is, Germany’s — contribution to the\r\nexpeditious implementation of the Brahimi report, or at\r\nleast parts thereof. The second is the quest for a more\r\ninclusive United Nations, “towards global\r\npartnerships”.\r\nAmbassador Brahimi’s report reflects that there\r\ncan be no sustainable development without lasting\r\npeace and security. The report highlighted two essential\r\nneeds of today’s peacekeeping: the need for better\r\ntraining and the need for quicker response time. New,\r\nmultifunctional peacekeeping operations require an\r\nincreasing number of qualified police and civilian\r\nexperts. These experts can range from civilian police\r\nofficers and election monitors to legal and\r\nadministrative experts or medical and demining teams.\r\nPreparation for these complex deployments must begin\r\nin good time, before the need for a United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operation emerges and the mandate is\r\nformulated. Quick response time is the key word.\r\nIt is against this background that in July 1999 the\r\nGerman Foreign Office established a German\r\ninternational training centre for civil personnel to be\r\ndeployed in international peacekeeping missions. One\r\nof its aims is to create a personnel reserve consisting of\r\ntrained experts suited for the most diverse tasks and not\r\nlimited to one single type of deployment. This is our\r\nimmediate contribution towards the creation of a pool\r\nof qualified personnel who, as recommended by the\r\nBrahimi Panel, can be made available, upon request, to\r\nthe United Nations — or to the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe — anywhere in the\r\nworld, quickly and in keeping with the specific needs\r\nof any given mission. A special civilian personnel\r\ndatabase has already been established to create a\r\nquasi-standby facility, in order to support international\r\nmissions in the crucial start-up phase, when qualified\r\npersonnel are most urgently needed.\r\nThe courses are now open to international\r\nparticipants and non-governmental organizations. We\r\nplan to offer training opportunities to those countries\r\nthat do not have their own training facilities for civilian\r\npersonnel. For nationals from countries that would find\r\nit difficult to bear the costs of participation, we intend\r\nto arrange for specific grants. Four hundred people will\r\nhave been trained by the end of the year 2000.\r\nCooperation with other international training centres to\r\ncreate uniform training standards will be a high priority\r\non our agenda.\r\nLet me now turn to the second major point, our\r\nquest for a more inclusive United Nations, and let me\r\nquote part of paragraph 5 of the historic Millennium\r\nDeclaration, contained in resolution 55/2:\r\n“We believe that the central challenge we\r\nface today is to ensure that globalization becomes\r\na positive force for all the world’s people. For\r\nwhile globalization offers great opportunities, at\r\npresent its benefits are very unevenly shared,\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nwhile its costs are unevenly distributed. Thus,\r\nonly through broad and sustained efforts to create\r\na shared future, based upon our common\r\nhumanity in all its diversity, can globalization be\r\nmade fully inclusive and equitable.”\r\nForeign Minister Fischer and many of his colleagues\r\nhighlighted this point in the recent general debate.\r\nI would like to draw delegations’ attention to the\r\nnew item, “Towards global partnerships”, which\r\nGermany has introduced into the agenda of this session\r\nof the General Assembly. It is well known that\r\nglobalization and big global challenges in many areas\r\nhave led to the emergence and increasing importance of\r\nnew global players, especially from civil society and,\r\nin particular, from transnational business. The\r\nSecretary-General rightly attaches importance to an\r\nappropriate involvement of these new players in the\r\nUnited Nations work.\r\nTogether with a number of other countries,\r\nGermany is of the opinion that it is up to the Member\r\nStates to discuss these issues in a constructive spirit,\r\nwith the aim of reaching a focused, coherent and\r\nintegrated approach, including everyone and leaving no\r\nregional grouping aside. In this spirit, we are already\r\nconducting consultations with a number of interested\r\nStates from all regions, in order to jointly introduce a\r\ndraft resolution on this topic at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We will be working to achieve the\r\nwidest possible consensus on this issue, and we are\r\nvery grateful that the reactions received so far have\r\nbeen quite encouraging.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has asked us to roll up\r\nour sleeves and start putting into action the bold\r\npledges that our heads of State and Government made\r\nduring the Millennium Summit, we made an attempt to\r\nfollow his advice. I would be grateful if Member States\r\nmade use of the German training centre for\r\ninternational peacekeeping missions and helped us to\r\nfind a fruitful consensus on our draft resolution,\r\n“Towards global partnerships”.\r\nMr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): Since this\r\nis my first statement to the plenary of the General\r\nAssembly in my capacity as Permanent Representative\r\nof the Republic of Belarus, allow me at the outset to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of this important body of the\r\nUnited Nations and to wish you every success in\r\ndischarging your mission.\r\nThe discussions at the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on such an important matter as the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/55/1) are focused on issues of unique\r\nimportance. The intensive and fundamental analyses of\r\nthe major trends in the development of today’s world\r\nmade by heads of State and Government during the\r\nMillennium Summit and further addressed during the\r\ngeneral debate provide us with a particular\r\nresponsibility in following today’s discussion.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus commends the United\r\nNations Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan for the high\r\nprofessionalism in his leadership of the United Nations\r\nduring the past year. All of us have been witnesses to\r\ntruly outstanding work aimed at strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations and defining the principal priorities for\r\nits future development. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nis an important part of this work.\r\nIn the past year, as the Secretary-General rightly\r\nobserved in his report, the international community\r\nwas still not close enough to meeting its major goals as\r\ndefined by the preamble to the United Nations Charter.\r\nOver this past year the United Nations has not\r\nsucceeded in saving humankind from the scourge of\r\nwar and in establishing a harmony between human\r\nrights, social progress and better living standards with\r\ngreater freedoms for all subjects of international law.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the United Nations has not\r\nremained a passive bystander to such a state of affairs.\r\nThe initiatives of the Secretary-General to launch an\r\nindependent study on Srebrenica and Rwanda, as well\r\nas the idea of the creation of a high-level panel to make\r\nrecommendations aimed at increasing the effectiveness\r\nof peacekeeping operations, chaired by Mr. Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi, have served as vivid examples of this. The\r\nspeediest possible analysis of the report of this group\r\nand a definition of the mechanisms for the\r\nimplementation of its recommendations are vitally\r\nimportant to us from the point of view of enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of the process of the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping functions.\r\nThe people of our countries need peace. In the\r\nlast century Belarus made an important contribution to\r\nthis process in demonstrating full compliance with the\r\nobligations of the United Nations by relinquishing the\r\npossession of nuclear arms. The President and the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus recently\r\nreaffirmed the intention of Belarus to continue its\r\ncontributions to the process of disarmament. During\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nthe course of the present session the Republic\r\nof Belarus has already deposited documents for the\r\nratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty and Protocol IV — on blinding laser\r\nweapons — to the Convention on Prohibitions or\r\nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional\r\nWeapons Which May Be Deemed to be Excessively\r\nInjurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects. Belarus\r\nwill continue to defend the noble initiative of the\r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central\r\nand Eastern Europe.\r\nThe Government of Belarus has carefully studied\r\nthe section of the report dealing with sanctions. We\r\nsupport the conclusion made by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report that these coercive measures do not\r\nalways yield identical results and that in recent years\r\nthe effectiveness of these measures has been\r\nincreasingly questionable. Moreover, in this context\r\nthird countries often are the parties who suffer. Belarus\r\nis no exception in this regard. Therefore, we support\r\nthe proposal made during the general debate by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, Mr.\r\nJan Kavan, concerning the creation within the\r\nframework of the United Nations of a special group\r\nsimilar to Mr. Brahimi’s panel to make a\r\ncomprehensive and impartial analysis of the whole\r\nrange of questions related to sanctions. Belarus is ready\r\nto actively participate in the work of this group at all\r\nits stages.\r\nIn analysing the section of the report, “Meeting\r\nhumanitarian commitments” (A/55/1, para. 109-153),\r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Belarus would like to\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to the issue of\r\nChernobyl. Today, on the eve of the fifteenth\r\nanniversary of the disaster, we still believe that this\r\nproblem is an anguish that not only Belarus continues\r\nto suffer from. Both the President and the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of my country have praised the United\r\nNations role in mitigating the consequences of this\r\ncatastrophe. We sincerely hope that the United Nations\r\nwill further assist in the development of new forms of\r\ncooperation with Belarus on this matter.\r\nThe Millennium Summit and the Millennium\r\nDeclaration adopted by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment put forward several important tasks before\r\nthe United Nations. Part of the work on renewing the\r\nUnited Nations began last year. That is reaffirmed by\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General that we are\r\nconsidering today. But the major part of the work still\r\nlies ahead of us. Belarus is ready to face new\r\nchallenges and actively implement the objectives\r\nfacing the United Nations.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): The symbolic\r\ncharacter of the year 2000 and the convening of the\r\nhistoric Millennium Summit of the United Nations will\r\ninevitably influence the consideration of every item on\r\nthe agenda of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. This is especially true with regard to the\r\nconsideration of the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe work of the Organization (A/55/1). I would like to\r\njoin previous speakers in thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for this important document containing concise\r\nand thoughtful coverage of the United Nations’\r\nactivities over the past year.\r\nMy delegation believes that a forward-looking\r\napproach towards assessing the United Nations’\r\nachievements and failures during the past twelve\r\nmonths would correspond in the best way to the spirit\r\nof the Millennium Assembly. In the course of the just\r\nconcluded general debate we heard repeated calls for\r\naction to implement the commitments made at the\r\nMillennium Summit. Therefore, an action-oriented\r\napproach is really essential for making the Summit’s\r\npromise a reality.\r\nI will focus my comments on the portion of the\r\nreport covering the Organization’s activities related to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nUkraine subscribes entirely to the words with which\r\nthe Secretary-General opens this part of the report:\r\n“Sustainable peace and security for all\r\ncountries and peoples remains a central objective\r\nof the United Nations at the dawn of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, as it was when the Organization\r\nwas founded over half a century ago.” (A/55/1,\r\npara. 29)\r\nThe lessons of the last decade in the maintenance\r\nof peace and security have impressively proved the\r\nindispensability of the United Nations, but they have\r\nalso revealed its serious limitations and shortcomings.\r\nTherefore, it is not accidentally that the task of\r\nredressing those limitations and shortcomings has come\r\nto the forefront of the discussion as the Organization\r\nenters the new century. Let me address the major areas\r\nwhere the changes are indeed imperative.\r\nUkraine joins the Secretary-General in\r\nwelcoming the growing attention of Member States\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\ntowards conflict prevention. For the last decade, my\r\ncountry has consistently advocated the need to\r\nstrengthen this dimension of United Nations activities.\r\nWe agree it is very important to maintain the existing\r\nbroad commitment to improving the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations for effective preventive action.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to reiterate the\r\nproposal put forward by the President of Ukraine\r\nLeonid Kuchma to develop a comprehensive conflict\r\nprevention strategy for the United Nations. Addressing\r\nthe meetings at the highest level of two principal\r\norgans of the United Nations — the Millennium\r\nSummit and the Security Council Summit — the\r\nPresident of Ukraine made a number of suggestions as\r\nto what could become concrete elements of such a\r\nstrategy. In particular, one of its key components could\r\nbe the establishment of United Nations regional centres\r\nfor conflict prevention. Another integral element could\r\nbe conflict prevention operations, which should gain\r\nprominence as a qualitatively new model of\r\npeacekeeping activities.\r\nRecognition of the importance of conflict\r\nprevention should also find its manifestation in\r\neveryday activities of the Security Council. For\r\nexample, the Secretary-General informs us in his report\r\nof the establishment of a Prevention Team within the\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs, which meets regularly\r\nto identify conflict situations that may offer potential\r\nfor preventive action (A/55/1, para. 42). We believe it\r\nwould be truly beneficial to initiate the practice of the\r\nSecurity Council receiving regular briefings by the\r\nPrevention Team.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General takes note of\r\na significant increase in peacekeeping operations over\r\nthe past 12 months. That increase coincided with the\r\nbeginning of Ukraine’s membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. In that regard, I am proud to state from this\r\nrostrum that, since Ukraine became a member of that\r\norgan, there has been not a single newly established or\r\nsubstantially expanded peacekeeping operation — from\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Sierra\r\nLeone, to southern Lebanon, to Kosovo, to East Timor,\r\nto Ethiopia and Eritrea — to which my country has not\r\ncontributed trained and properly equipped personnel.\r\nUkraine’s commitment to peacekeeping operations\r\nexplains our determination to strengthen that key\r\ninstrument available to the United Nations in\r\ndischarging its responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. A powerful impetus in\r\nthat endeavour was provided by the Security Council’s\r\nsummit meeting, which resulted in a number of very\r\nimportant undertakings, including a pledge to adopt\r\nclearly defined, credible and achievable mandates.\r\nUkraine will pay special attention to practical\r\nimplementation of another Security Council summit\r\ncommitment: to strengthen consultations between that\r\norgan and troop-contributing countries.\r\nIt is also very important to give urgent\r\nconsideration to the pertinent recommendations of the\r\nreport (A/55/305) of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations. As we have been informed, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has already committed himself to\r\nimplementing the changes for which he is responsible.\r\nThis morning the Security Council started to discuss\r\nthe recommendations that fall within its area of\r\nresponsibility. The General Assembly too should\r\nrespond to the Secretary-General’s appeal to act\r\nexpeditiously on the Panel’s recommendations. In that\r\nconnection, Ukraine believes that the Special\r\nCommittee on Peacekeeping Operations represents the\r\nbest and most appropriate forum in which to consider\r\nthe report, and calls on its Bureau to convene a special\r\nsession to start the discussion, with a view to making\r\nprompt recommendations to the General Assembly. We\r\nalso think it is important to initiate a mechanism of\r\nregular consultations among the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat on the\r\nimplementation of the Panel’s recommendations.\r\nThe last issue I would like to take up relates to\r\neconomic sanctions imposed by the Security Council\r\nwith a view to maintaining or restoring peace and\r\nsecurity. Ukraine could not agree more with the very\r\nprecise conclusions contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report regarding both the efficacy and the\r\nnegative side effects of sanctions. In that respect, I\r\nwould like to reiterate Ukraine’s strong view that it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to develop a clear and coherent\r\nmethodology for the imposition and lifting of sanctions\r\nthat takes into consideration the concerns of civilian\r\npopulations and the interests of third countries. We\r\nbelieve it is important to maintain the recent Security\r\nCouncil practice of defining time limits for sanctions at\r\nthe time of their imposition. It is of primary importance\r\nto develop objective criteria and mechanisms for\r\nassessing the effectiveness of sanctions and their\r\nimpact, including on the target State. We also support\r\nthe immediate lifting of sanctions when there are\r\nsufficient grounds to believe that they have served their\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\npurpose. Ukraine is determined to pursue efforts aimed\r\nat what the Secretary-General defines as\r\n“the evolution of sanctions into a more potent\r\ninstrument of deterrence and conflict\r\nprevention”. (A/55/1, para. 101)\r\nLet me conclude by stressing Ukraine’s\r\nwillingness to maintain its resolve to contribute\r\nactively to the common endeavour aimed at\r\nstrengthening the United Nations.\r\nMr. Alemán (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): I wish\r\nto begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his\r\nannual report on the work of the Organization (A/55/1),\r\nwhich offers quite a comprehensive overview of the\r\nactivities that have been carried out, and of the\r\nobstacles and challenges that will be facing the United\r\nNations in the years to come. Basically, the\r\nOrganization has been and continues to be a propitious\r\nforum for the search for fair and lasting solutions in the\r\nareas of gravest concern to the international\r\ncommunity: peace and security; meeting humanitarian\r\ncommitments; development cooperation; the\r\ninternational legal order; and human rights.\r\nAs the report observes, the main task of the\r\nUnited Nations is the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. I completely agree that the nature\r\nand scope of the causes of conflict have changed.\r\nDuring the cold war, ideological confrontation and\r\nviolations of borders were the gravest factors\r\ndestabilizing peace, but today, most conflicts are\r\ninternal conflicts in which violations of the most\r\nfundamental human rights of entire populations\r\nconstitute the principal threat to world security.\r\nMy delegation would like to highlight and clearly\r\ndefine two considerations that will guide its conduct in\r\nthis sphere. First, we consider that human rights issues\r\ndo not fall exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction\r\nof States: they are governed also by the Charter, which\r\nis an international treaty whose obligations are binding\r\non the parties to it. Secondly, we believe that the\r\npolitical shortcomings and historical legacies that are\r\nreflected in the organs responsible for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security can never legitimize\r\ninternational punitive action, however much it may be\r\nbased on lofty humanitarian principles. Collective\r\naction requiring the use of force must conform to the\r\nprovisions of Chapter VII of the San Francisco Charter;\r\nany action that ignores those provisions will damage\r\nboth the credibility of the Organization and the\r\ninstitutional stability of these mechanisms.\r\nHere I would like to commend the praiseworthy\r\nefforts of the high-level Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations, which are reflected in the so-called\r\nBrahimi report (A/55/305). Its content and, especially,\r\nits recommendations deserve level-headed, realistic\r\nanalysis by the Organization, so that the United\r\nNations can have access to a strengthened and renewed\r\nmechanism with which to carry out effectively the\r\nincreasingly complex tasks facing it in this area. This,\r\nof course, must be without prejudice to the universally\r\nendorsed principles that govern its activities.\r\nPeace and security and their polar opposites,\r\nviolence and instability, are concepts that cannot be\r\naddressed in isolation from the economic and social\r\nwell-being of peoples. Development, indeed, is the key\r\ntask facing nations as they strive for advancement. Its\r\nfundamental objective is to offer new options for\r\nindividual well-being, and attaining it requires a firm\r\nfoundation for human development and the\r\nconsolidation of democracy. Those aspirations should\r\nbe common to all our efforts, but they are reality only\r\nfor the few: for the rest, they remain in the realm of\r\ntheory, of what ought to be. In their national efforts to\r\nachieve higher levels of economic and social progress,\r\ndeveloping countries face many constraints. These\r\nproblems have persisted for decades, and are\r\ncompounded by the effects of a globalization that is\r\nfocused more on free markets, competition and new\r\ncommunications technologies than on ensuring that the\r\nopportunities are disseminated worldwide, among all\r\ncountries and among all sectors of the population.\r\nIn this context, the Secretary-General’s report\r\ncontains ideas and initiatives that invite reflection and\r\ndecisive action by the international community. I agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General that the most important\r\ndevelopment goal of the United Nations must continue\r\nto be the elimination of poverty. To that end, it is\r\nnecessary to adopt appropriate mechanisms so that\r\nglobalization will generate benefits for all countries,\r\nregardless of their degree of development. It is time to\r\npropose principles and guidelines to direct the\r\nglobalization process, which is still inchoate.\r\nThe concept of shared responsibility in managing\r\ninternational relations is now a principle of\r\ninternational law, reflected in the Millennium Summit\r\nmandate, which clearly defines the central role of the\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nUnited Nations in this regard. The new millennium\r\nmust bear witness to the historic responsibility of all\r\nMember States to strengthen multilateral mechanisms\r\nin order to create a more equitable international\r\nscenario and thereby one that is more peaceful and\r\nsecure.\r\nIn this context, the Organization’s effort to create\r\nnorms to regulate international relations in all areas of\r\nhuman activity is commendable. This contribution by\r\nthe United Nations must strengthen the complex\r\nprocess of interdependency that is emerging from the\r\nnew international order and that requires faithful\r\nrespect and observance in order to convert theory into a\r\npractical attitude.\r\nThe reflections in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nlead us to maintain that the United Nations, with new\r\nand greater tasks, requires today, more than ever, the\r\nfinancial support of Member States to achieve the\r\naspirations of international peace and development.\r\nThe political support that our heads of State offered our\r\nOrganization at the recent Millennium Summit must be\r\nreflected in adequate financial support. It must be\r\nprovided according to each State’s real capacity to pay,\r\nsince development levels vary so much that poorer\r\ncountries should not assume additional responsibilities\r\nthat further encumber their economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Only through a system that recognizes\r\nthese differences and provides predictability will we\r\nensure vital financial resources and guarantee the\r\nprinciple of fairly sharing the burden.\r\nMr. imonović (Croatia): My delegation wishes\r\nto express its gratitude for a comprehensive report\r\ncovering the field of the broad activities of the\r\nOrganization during the past year. The present agenda\r\nitem allows us to reflect in a more specific way upon\r\nthe work of the Organization and the every day\r\nchallenges that have confronted it during this symbolic\r\nyear.\r\nAs stated in the report, no issue commands more\r\nof our attention and resources than the achievement of\r\npeace and security. Indeed, the demands placed on the\r\nUnited Nations in the fields of conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping, peace-building and the various follow-\r\non operations will continue to constitute the core\r\nactivities of the Organization. At the same time, it is\r\nthe timeliness and the overall quality of the\r\nOrganization’s responses to such demands that define\r\nits utility to its broad constituencies.\r\nMember States should heed the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recognition that\r\n“collective security can no longer be narrowly\r\ndefined as the absence of armed conflict, be it\r\nbetween or within States.” (A/55/1, para. 31)\r\nThe report rightly calls for innovative approaches to\r\nmanaging complex peace operations, including those\r\nthat will not shy away from crossing over institutional\r\nand administrative turf in the search for comprehensive\r\nsolutions. In this connection, Croatia agrees with the\r\nview of the Secretary-General that the world has a\r\nresponsibility to act when universally accepted basic\r\nhuman rights are being violated on a massive scale.\r\nThe lessons of Srebrenica, Rwanda, and most\r\nrecently Sierra Leone, among others, have once more\r\ndemonstrated the importance of clear, well-managed\r\nand achievable Security Council mandates. But even\r\nthe best mandate remains a dead letter unless it is\r\nsupported by political will and the necessary means for\r\nits implementation.\r\nWe believe that the Croatian experience of\r\nprogress from a host country to a contributor of\r\npeacekeepers can be useful for the Organization. In this\r\nregard, we look forward to the conclusion during this\r\nsession of the mandate of the small United Nations\r\nMission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) in Croatia\r\nand Croatia’s increased participation in peacekeeping\r\noperations elsewhere.\r\nClearly, peace operations are ripe for a\r\ncomprehensive and substantial overhaul. In this regard,\r\nthe Croatian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his\r\nstatement in the General Assembly on 13 September,\r\nwelcomed the Report of the Panel on United Nations\r\nPeace Operations (A/55/305). Croatia supports the\r\nreform process in all its aspects, including the\r\nconceptualization and adoption of Security Council\r\nmandates, integrated mission planning and support,\r\nrapid deployment and mission duration timelines, as\r\nwell as the restructuring of the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations.\r\nThe United Nations continues to operate in a\r\ndynamic international environment. Human security is\r\nchallenged not only by conflict, but also by\r\nemergencies occasioned by nature. Irrespective of the\r\ncause, global interconnectedness dictates that the\r\nimpact of such disruptions on people, on their\r\neconomic well-being and the environment, have a\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nbroad effect. Over the past year the United Nations has\r\nbeen increasingly called upon to coordinate\r\nhumanitarian action through an inter-agency approach.\r\nThe achievements of the Organization in this field,\r\nfrom Kosovo and East Timor to Venezuela and\r\nMozambique, have been admirable.\r\nCroatia is encouraged by the undertakings of the\r\nnuclear-weapon States made during the 2000 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Nevertheless,\r\nprogress in overall disarmament remains sporadic.\r\nAdditionally, the role of the United Nations in\r\ndemining is important for many countries that continue\r\nto suffer from this blight well after many other aspects\r\nof a conflict have faded into history.\r\nThe past year has been one of progress in the\r\nfield of human rights, especially in strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations system to uphold and further develop\r\nthe international code of human rights. In October 1999\r\nthe General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol to\r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women, which has now been\r\nsigned by 62 Member States, including Croatia. It will\r\nenter into force before the end of the year.\r\nNevertheless, of the many remaining challenges, the\r\ntrafficking of women needs to be dealt with.\r\nAdditionally, the integration into economic and\r\ndevelopmental policies of the world’s disabled\r\npopulation remains to be achieved.\r\nThe legal protection of children at the\r\ninternational level has been one of the United Nations\r\nsuccess stories, with the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child being the most universally ratified\r\ninstrument. However, Croatia believes that the issue of\r\nthe protection of children is yet to adequately filter\r\nthrough to the regional and local levels, particularly in\r\nregard to overcoming inequities in the promotion of\r\neducation. The Organization has a role to play in this\r\nprocess.\r\nThe final judgement on globalization cannot yet\r\nbe made. Rather, we have numerous interim\r\nobservations as to its characteristics, benefits and\r\nnegative effects. In this regard, the adoption by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council of the Ministerial\r\nDeclaration on the potential of information and\r\ncommunication technologies to achieve development\r\ngoals and the need to bridge the digital divide\r\nrepresents an important contribution by the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn the same vein, the preparations for the high-\r\nlevel event on financing for development to be held\r\nnext year are proceeding well. The broad-ranging\r\nconsultations presently being carried out involving the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization, among other key world economic actors,\r\naugur well for the necessary broad-based ownership of\r\nthe outcome of that United Nations-driven event.\r\nCroatia remains fully committed to having the\r\nfinances of the Organization placed on a sound,\r\nsustainable and equitable basis. In that regard, we look\r\nforward to the reform process relating to both the\r\nregular and the peacekeeping scales, ultimately\r\nresulting in the reaffirmation of the capacity-to-pay\r\nprinciple as the basis for the contributions of Member\r\nStates. Similarly, Croatia supports the strengthening\r\nand revitalization of the Organization, including the\r\nreform of its principle organs. Croatia believes that due\r\nregard should be given to restoring the careful balance\r\nbetween the principal organs of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly with regard to that between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council.\r\nMr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive and very informative annual\r\nreport on the work of the Organization. The report\r\ncovers in detail all aspects of the Organization’s work\r\nin the past year and deserves our careful study.\r\nAt the just-concluded Millennium Summit of the\r\nUnited Nations, heads of State or Government of\r\nMember States reviewed and summarized the United\r\nNations’ experiences in the past 55 years and adopted\r\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration, reiterating\r\ntheir commitment to the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Having drawn a blueprint for\r\nthe work of the Organization in the new century and\r\nthe new millennium, the Summit has offered important\r\nguidance for our work.\r\nI would like to focus my statement today on three\r\nquestions. I will first address the matter of\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nAs the Secretary-General indicated in his report,\r\n“Sustainable peace and security for all countries\r\nand peoples remains a central objective of the\r\nUnited Nations.” (A/55/1, para. 29)\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nIn the new situation, peacekeeping operations remain\r\nan important means for the United Nations to fulfil its\r\nobligations in safeguarding international peace and\r\nsecurity. Experience in recent years has shown that the\r\nSecurity Council’s role in that field is irreplaceable and\r\nits authority unquestionable.\r\nThe Security Council’s responsibility and\r\npolitical leadership in peacekeeping should therefore\r\nbe preserved and strengthened further. At the same\r\ntime, the purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter — as well as other long-established\r\npeacekeeping principles such as neutrality, the consent\r\nof the parties to the conflict, and using force only in\r\nself-defence — should continue to be observed.\r\nDespite its contribution to international peace and\r\nsecurity, peacekeeping is by no means a panacea. In\r\norder to enable United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations to be more effective we must address both\r\nthe symptoms and the root causes of problems. In other\r\nwords, we must try to root out the real causes of\r\nconflict. In that connection, we hope that the United\r\nNations will attach real importance to the situation in\r\nAfrica and increase its involvement so as to resolve\r\nissues related to that continent.\r\nAs for the dilemma of intervention, the Chinese\r\ndelegation is of the view that, as the United Nations\r\nshoulders a primary responsibility for maintaining\r\nworld peace, it should make more positive\r\ncontributions to stopping massive humanitarian crises\r\nand preventing tragic massive killings of innocent\r\ncivilians. At the same time, however, we are also fully\r\naware of the complexity of international intervention\r\nand the risk of inappropriate intervention. Any\r\nintervention must be authorized by the Security\r\nCouncil and should be aimed at eliminating the root\r\ncauses of a conflict rather than at delaying its\r\nsettlement, and at facilitating reconciliation between\r\nparties to a conflict rather than at fuelling hatred and\r\nconfrontation. Big powers and blocs of countries\r\nshould respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nof a country involved in a conflict rather than use\r\nhumanitarian intervention to interfere in its internal\r\naffairs or to trigger new conflicts.\r\nIn the past year, the United Nations witnessed a\r\nrapid increase both in the number and scale of new\r\npeacekeeping operations. But peacekeeping efforts in\r\nSierra Leone and other places have not yielded the\r\nexpected results, which has highlighted problems in\r\ncurrent peacekeeping operations and the need for\r\nreform. In that connection, the report submitted by the\r\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations designated\r\nby the Secretary-General is very timely. The Chinese\r\ndelegation appreciates the efforts of Ambassador\r\nBrahimi and other members of the Panel. We believe\r\nthat the report has put forward a series of thoughtful\r\nrecommendations on how to improve United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations, which we believe deserve in-\r\ndepth study by relevant bodies of the United Nations.\r\nRecommendations that enjoy broad agreement and are\r\neasy to put in place should be implemented in a timely\r\nmanner. We look forward to discussions on the report,\r\nand we are ready to make due contributions to the\r\npeacekeeping operations of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, I would like to speak about\r\ndevelopment. Another important task for the United\r\nNations is to respond actively to globalization and\r\nrealize the common development of mankind. The\r\nsurging tide of globalization has brought us immense\r\nchallenges as well as opportunities. Developing\r\ncountries have borne the brunt of the negative effects\r\nof that tide. The United Nations must therefore play its\r\ndue role in narrowing the gap between the poor and the\r\nrich and in promoting common prosperity in the\r\ninternational community, so as to ensure that all\r\ncountries benefit equally from globalization and to\r\nprevent the further widening of the gap between the\r\nNorth and the South and the polarization of the world.\r\nThe United Nations should give top priority to the\r\nissue of development, greatly increase — rather than\r\ndecrease — its allocation of resources in that field and\r\nreally make the eradication of poverty its most\r\nimportant development objective today, as indicated in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report. We appreciate the great\r\nefforts and achievements already made by the United\r\nNations in this regard. It is our hope that it will, as\r\nrequired by the new situation, make an in-depth study\r\nof the negative impacts of globalization on the\r\nendeavour to eradicate poverty. The United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration has put forward many specific\r\nobjectives for poverty eradication. We hope that the\r\nSecretariat will submit as soon as possible detailed\r\nimplementation measures, so that those measures will\r\nnot merely remain on paper for ever.\r\nThirdly, global strategic stability is the\r\nfoundation on which world security rests, and the 1972\r\nTreaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile\r\nSystems (ABM) is an important cornerstone for global\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nstrategic stability. The adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the resolution on Preservation of and\r\nCompliance with the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-\r\nBallistic Missile Systems at its fifty-fourth session\r\n(A/RES/54/54) by an overwhelming majority\r\nrepresents the call by the majority of countries in the\r\nworld for certain countries to preserve and strictly\r\nobserve the ABM Treaty. The United Nations should\r\ncontinue to pay serious attention to the efforts by a\r\ncountry to develop a national defence system to the\r\ndetriment of global strategic stability and to take the\r\nnecessary measures to forestall any further\r\ndevelopment of this dangerous move. The illicit\r\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons has caused\r\nserious security, economic and social problems for\r\ndeveloping countries in general and African countries\r\nin particular. The international community should take\r\nadvantage of the United Nations Conference on the\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects, to be held next year as well as its\r\npreparatory process, to work for an early solution to\r\nthis issue.\r\nMr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nWe are confident that with the concerted efforts\r\nof all Member States, the United Nations, as the most\r\nrepresentative and most important intergovernmental\r\norganization in today’s world, will display new vitality\r\nin the new century, guided by the purposes and\r\nprinciples set forth in the Charter.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nAllow me first of all to congratulate the President on\r\nhis election to this important and responsible post. We\r\nare sure that under his leadership this historic\r\nMillennium Assembly will achieve impressive results.\r\nI would also like to associate myself with all of\r\nthose who have expressed gratitude to the President of\r\nthe fifty-fourth session, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, for the effective organization of its work and\r\nalso for the preparation of the Millennium Summit.\r\nAllow me also to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization, which\r\ncontains many valuable ideas on virtually all aspects of\r\nthe activity of our community. The proposals and\r\nconcepts contained in the report deserve the most\r\ncareful study. Given time constraints my statement will\r\ndwell in greater detail on those issues which, in the\r\ncontext of the problems of the epoch of globalization,\r\nrequire the most intensive attention from the\r\ninternational community and which are of particular\r\nconcern to our Republic.\r\nThe present session of the Assembly, which is\r\nmost significant and symbolic in nature, is taking place\r\nwith the enhanced and intensive attention by the\r\ninternational community — attention to pressing\r\nproblems of the international agenda, which we will be\r\ndiscussing during the next few months.\r\nThe fifty-fifth session began its work with the\r\nhistoric Millennium Summit, an international forum\r\nwhich had the participation of an unprecedented\r\nnumber of heads of State and Government. This\r\ndemonstrates our shared desire to reach a level of\r\nunderstanding of the historic changes taking place, an\r\nawareness of the all-pervasive interdependence of\r\ntoday’s world and to demonstrate our dedication to the\r\nfundamental principles enshrined in the Charter.\r\nWe fully share the provision in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General to the effect that one of the\r\nfundamental problems of today’s world, on the eve of\r\nthe new century, remains the need to ensure\r\ninternational security and stability. We are firmly\r\nconvinced that the leading role here must be played by\r\nthe United Nations as the most authoritative and\r\nuniversal international organization.\r\nToday, it is quite obvious that, in the present\r\nconditions of globalization when the world is closely\r\ninterlinked and united, there can be no comprehensive\r\ninternational security without the achievement of\r\nsecurity of regions and the national security of\r\nindividual States. We believe that the principle of\r\nglobalism will continue to remain one of the\r\nfundamental and pivotal criteria for the processes of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Here, Uzbekistan\r\nfavours strict and unswerving compliance by all States\r\nwith the international regime of nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament. Without that it is\r\nimpossible to speak of strategic stability on either the\r\nglobal or the regional level.\r\nHowever, along with the principle of globalism,\r\nin the process of nuclear disarmament, the important\r\nsignificance of regional factors is becoming obvious,\r\nfactors which can, to a significant extent, both promote\r\nand block a strengthening of the comprehensive\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and disarmament.\r\nHere there is a need to emphasize that the\r\nestablishment, on the initiative of States of the region,\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nof nuclear-weapon-free zones is a substantive\r\ncontribution to strengthening the non-proliferation\r\nregime, disarmament, and above all to the process of\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWhat is of particular significance is the\r\ninternational legal legitimization of Uzbekistan’s\r\ninitiative on the establishment in Central Asia of a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. We highly value the efforts\r\nof the Secretary-General, the Department of\r\nDisarmament Affairs, headed by Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Dhanapala, and also the United Nations\r\nRegional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia\r\nand the Pacific to support the present process for the\r\nestablishment of this zone and, in particular, support\r\nfor the activity of the regional expert group working on\r\nthe conclusion of the draft treaty on a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone in Central Asia.\r\nAs was noted by the President of the Republic of\r\nUzbekistan, Mr. Islam Karimov, during the Millennium\r\nSummit, today’s challenges and risks require a dynamic\r\nadaptation of all of the United Nations systems and\r\nmechanisms to the complex realities and prospects and\r\nto drawing up new approaches to ensure peace, security\r\nand stability.\r\nIn our view, the need for the reform of the United\r\nNations means the adoption of a range of measures to\r\nenhance its role and significance, above all in resolving\r\nregional and global problems.\r\nIn that context, we believe that there is a need for\r\nreform of the Security Council through expansion of\r\nthe number of its permanent members, including both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. Germany and\r\nJapan, which have reaffirmed their important role in\r\nglobal policy and, what is also important, who are\r\nmajor sponsors for financing the activity of the United\r\nNations and many projects and programmes for\r\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping, have a full right to be\r\nrepresented among the permanent members of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nFurthermore, we find it important to ensure\r\neffectiveness of the Secretary-General in reacting to\r\nglobal and regional challenges through the expansion\r\nof his competence.\r\nWe agree that there is a need for further\r\nenhancement of the role and responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council in issues of preventing armed\r\nconflicts, the effective use of instruments and\r\nmechanisms for a peaceful solution to disputes,\r\nincluding the use for conflict resolution — in particular\r\nfor conflicts that continue a long time — of the\r\nso-called mechanism of peace enforcement.\r\nAs was noted by the President of the Republic of\r\nUzbekistan in his statement at the Millennium Summit,\r\nin today’s world we find that the remnants of the cold\r\nwar are now being replaced by international terrorism\r\nand extremism and by aggressive nationalism and\r\nseparatism as dangerous detonators undermining peace\r\nand stability. We must recognize that terrorism has\r\nbeen transformed into one of the major challenges and\r\nthreats to international security and stability of our\r\ntime. Here, we hope that this question will be given the\r\nhighest priority in the activity of our Organization.\r\nAs to the relevance and urgency of escalating the\r\ninternational community’s campaign against the rising\r\nthreat of international terrorism, Uzbekistan welcomes\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal of convening an\r\ninternational conference to combat terrorism under\r\nUnited Nations auspices. The time has come to make it\r\nvery clear that terrorism and extremism can be\r\ncounteracted only by the organization of a campaign\r\nagainst not only their manifestations, but above all\r\nagainst those international centres that, endowed with\r\nenormous financial and other resources, are training\r\nand exporting terrorists whom they provide with the\r\nmost up-to-date technical means, weapons and\r\nfinancing.\r\nThe anti-terrorism campaign requires coordinated\r\ninternational efforts and broad acknowledgement of the\r\nrights of States to protect their citizens from terrorist\r\nattacks. These provisions demonstrate the relevance of\r\na consideration of Uzbekistan’s initiative for the\r\nestablishment, under United Nations auspices, of an\r\ninternational centre to combat terrorism, as put forward\r\nby President Islam Karimov at the Istanbul Summit of\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope. In this respect, Uzbekistan once again calls on\r\nthe Members of the Organization to support that\r\ninitiative and to begin its practical implementation as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report focuses\r\nsignificant attention on the issue of the drug threat.\r\nThis problem is far-ranging and further exacerbated by\r\nthe current upsurge of the two most dangerous\r\nphenomena of our times: international terrorism and\r\nthe drug trade. Billions of dollars of income from the\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nillicit trade in drugs serve to provide financial support\r\nto international terrorism. Here, of great significance is\r\nthe implementation, not in words but in deeds, of the\r\nagreement of the States of the Group of 8 to root out\r\nthe sources of funding for terrorist activity.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration, which defines the\r\nmajor areas for joint efforts in the twenty-first century,\r\nis the expression of the determination of the\r\nOrganization’s Members to take agreed measures to\r\ncombat States’ international terrorism and to redouble\r\ntheir efforts to implement their commitments to check\r\nthe universal drug problem. We are convinced that the\r\ninternational high-level conference, entitled\r\n“Enhancing Security and Stability in Central Asia: an\r\nIntegrated Approach to Counter Drugs, Organized\r\nCrime and Terrorism” — which is being organized\r\njointly by the United Nations Office for Drug Control\r\nand Crime Prevention, the OSCE and the Government\r\nof Uzbekistan and is to take place in Tashkent on\r\n19 and 20 October — will make a positive contribution\r\nto the implementation of the commitments that have\r\nbeen undertaken.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish once again to reaffirm the\r\nfundamental concept of the Secretary-General’s report\r\nthat, on the threshold of the new millennium, we must\r\nyet again assume our responsibilities and exploit the\r\nhistoric momentum to overcome existing differences\r\nand obstacles, unite our efforts to achieve our noble\r\ngoals and free our planet of devastating wars and\r\nconflict and ecological, social and economic crises and\r\ncataclysms.\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Allow me at the outset to express our\r\nappreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-General in\r\nhis management of the work of the United Nations. We\r\nalso wish to offer our thanks for his report, contained\r\nin document A/55/1, and for the valuable information it\r\ncontains, which clearly reflects this Organization’s role\r\nin facing the ever-increasing international challenges\r\nand problems.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s comments in his report\r\nembody ideas and proposals that could contribute to\r\nthe development of the activities of the United Nations\r\nwithin the framework of its mandate under the Charter.\r\nProminent among these activities is the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The United Arab\r\nEmirates attaches great importance to the role of our\r\ninternational Organization in containing conflicts\r\nbetween or within States and agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s concept of collective security, as laid out in\r\nparagraph 31 of his report. This approach encompasses\r\ngross abuses of human rights, large-scale displacement\r\nof civilian populations, international terrorism, the\r\nAIDS pandemic, drug and arms trafficking and\r\nenvironmental disasters, in addition to the vast gap that\r\nexists between the developed and developing countries\r\nin economic, social and human development. By\r\nnecessity, this issue calls for international unity in the\r\nsearch for objective solutions to these problems at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nThe cooperation of States and their commitment\r\nto the purposes and principles of the Charter and to the\r\nprotocols of international law and other international\r\ninstruments governing international relations are\r\nessential to conflict-prevention and peace-building. We\r\ntherefore support the Secretary-General’s efforts to\r\nimprove the capacities of the United Nations, in\r\ncooperation with regional and international\r\norganizations, to contain wars and disputes. We also\r\nsupport his view that\r\n“Peace-building in practice involves initiatives to\r\nhelp promote national reconciliation and justice,\r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law.”\r\n(A/55/1, para. 94)\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report points out that,\r\nwhile the past year has seen an enormous increase in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, some of these\r\nhave failed because the parties to the conflicts have\r\nlacked the necessary political will, in addition to the\r\nadministrative and financial problems inherent in any\r\npeacekeeping operation. We therefore support the\r\npositive and constructive proposals and\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General that have\r\nbeen included in the report of the Panel on United\r\nNations Peace Operations, chaired by Mr. Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi. We call for a methodical allocation of human\r\nand financial resources to the promotion of the various\r\ncivilian, humanitarian and judiciary efforts being made\r\nto contain the repercussions of these conflicts, such as\r\nthe repatriation of displaced persons; the accelerated\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants into civil society;\r\naddressing violations of human rights — including of\r\nthose suffering under occupation — and bringing their\r\nperpetrators to justice; the protection of international\r\ncivil servants in the field; and the provision of\r\ninternational political and financial support to States in\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\norder to establish stability and sustainable economic\r\nand social development.\r\nThe Secretary-General has pointed out in\r\nparagraphs 102, 103 and 104 of his report that\r\ndisarmament — in particular the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons — is\r\nan important element of United Nations strategy to\r\nensure the security and safety of countries and peoples.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates believes in the right of\r\nStates, particularly small countries, to enhance their\r\ndefence capabilities so as to address their regional\r\nsecurity concerns and preserve their sovereignty,\r\nterritorial integrity and political independence. At the\r\nsame time, however, the United Arab Emirates does not\r\nsupport States whose policies aim at possessing\r\nprohibited weapons — leading to escalation of tension\r\nand instability at the international and regional levels.\r\nWe therefore call upon those States to reconsider their\r\npositions and to follow more transparent and objective\r\npolicies that will lead to finding just and lasting\r\npeaceful solutions to the conflicts between them and\r\ntheir neighbours, in accordance with the principles of\r\ninternational legitimacy.\r\nWe also support the Secretary-General’s call to\r\nfollow up on the promising results of the 2000 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In response\r\nto this call, nuclear-weapon States should gradually\r\neliminate their nuclear arsenals. This will promote the\r\nstability and security of the international environment.\r\nChapter II of the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nmeeting humanitarian commitments reviews clearly the\r\nactivities undertaken by the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies — namely, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, the World Health Organization and\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization. These agencies\r\nplay prominent roles in providing humanitarian relief\r\nand assistance, as well as developmental, educational,\r\nenvironmental and economic assistance, and in\r\ncombating disease and dealing with natural disasters in\r\nmany countries, particularly in the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nWe appreciate all constructive and positive efforts\r\nmade by those specialized agencies in these fields,\r\nincluding the efforts of the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent societies. To support these humanitarian and\r\ndevelopmental efforts, the international community,\r\nparticularly the developed countries, need to provide\r\nfinancial and technical assistance and to help these\r\nagencies meet their responsibilities. The international\r\ncommunity also needs to provide assistance to affected\r\ncountries, in accordance with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe agree fully with the Secretary-General’s\r\nassessment of the prevailing social and economic\r\nconditions, including the poverty and debt problems\r\nfaced by many developing countries — particularly the\r\npoorest among them. The report captures precisely the\r\nkinds of challenges and problems that these countries\r\nface — challenges and problems that have sparked civil\r\nand regional wars.\r\nGiven this reality, the international community\r\nshould accord these problems and their consequences\r\nthe important consideration they deserve. This could be\r\ndone by establishing an equitable and just economic\r\norder — an order that the developing countries\r\nthemselves would participate in formulating — so as to\r\nbring stability and growth to the international\r\neconomic situation.\r\nThe very important recommendations and\r\nproposals of the historic Millennium Summit, held at\r\nthe beginning of this month, emphasized the significant\r\nrole that the United Nations plays in the current\r\ninternational climate. This Organization is the natural\r\nand right forum to deal with international global issues\r\nand the need to promote its purposes and principles,\r\nparticularly in the light of multifaceted globalization\r\nand the many other changes in current international\r\nrelations. We should therefore restructure the United\r\nNations and improve its financial and human resources\r\nand its various activities, so as to allow the\r\nOrganization to carry out its important tasks, including\r\ndealing with current conflicts, peace-building and\r\nbringing about sustainable development for the good of\r\nhumanity as a whole.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil): I wish to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on the\r\nwork of the Organization. It is an excellent guide for\r\nus, and it shows how the mandates created by the\r\nMember States are being translated into the day-to-day\r\nwork of the United Nations machinery.\r\nThe United Nations has sought to respond to the\r\nnew challenges of the world. Peacekeeping operations\r\nhave taken on more tasks and responsibilities to meet\r\nthe increased complexity of the situations on the\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nground. New programmes have been set up under the\r\naegis of the United Nations to cope with the problems\r\nthat respect no national boundaries.\r\nThe Organization has also taken measures to help\r\nin the eradication of poverty, illiteracy and contagious\r\ndisease. The efforts to combat AIDS are an example in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe Global Compact initiative has become an\r\nimportant innovation aimed at forging a broad-based\r\ncoalition for change. We all know that Governments\r\nalone cannot do much. The involvement of civil\r\nsociety, non-governmental organizations and the\r\nprivate sector is key to advancing the objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations in many fields, including development\r\nand respect for fundamental human rights. These\r\nexamples show that the United Nations is in fact\r\nmoving in the right direction.\r\nThe Millennium Summit was an opportunity to\r\nrecommit ourselves to strengthening the mechanisms to\r\ndeal with the new and sometimes contradictory forces\r\nthat shape our times. The Millennium Summit offered\r\nan opportunity for world leaders to take stock of the\r\nachievements of multilateralism as well as of the\r\nchallenges ahead. The holding of the Summit was in\r\nitself a success and reflected the prestige of the\r\nOrganization and its Secretary-General.\r\nThe statements made at the Summit, the\r\ndiscussions at the round tables and the Declaration\r\nadopted have once again set lofty goals for the\r\nOrganization. Now it is time to address those goals in\r\nthe daily business of the Organization. As the\r\nSecretary-General rightly put it, now is the moment to\r\nstart converting into action the bold pledges that our\r\nheads of State and Government made. The problem is\r\nhow to do this, how to overcome the shallow consensus\r\non general principles and start taking concrete steps\r\ntowards the implementation of the commitments.\r\nThere are already concrete proposals on the table\r\nwith regard to peacekeeping operations. The Brahimi\r\nreport is the result of a comprehensive review of the\r\nwork of the Organization in this field. The Deputy\r\nSecretary-General is now preparing a plan of\r\nimplementation for the consideration of Member\r\nStates.\r\nBrazil welcomes these initiatives. Our peace\r\noperations have grown in number and complexity,\r\nstretching the capacity of the Organization to respond\r\nefficiently to the new mandates.\r\nAs stated in the Brahimi report, the mandates\r\nmust be clear, credible and achievable. We need to be\r\nsure that the mandate of a peacekeeping operation fits\r\nthe specific requirements of a given situation. It is clear\r\nthat the final decision is always based on political\r\nevaluation. Nevertheless, we can improve the odds of\r\nsuccess if the mandate is also based on reliable\r\ninformation and solid technical advice. To that end, the\r\nrecommendation to reinforce the capacity of the\r\nSecretariat to gather and analyse information is\r\nwelcome and should be given due consideration. We\r\nmust increase the number of officers in the Secretariat\r\nthat provide guidance for troops and police officers. In\r\naddition, much trouble and frustration could be avoided\r\nif we applied the very simple idea that it is better not to\r\nestablish a mission than to establish one that is flawed\r\nfrom its inception.\r\nA meaningful implementation of even a few\r\nrecommendations of the report will require substantial\r\nadditional resources. We need to identify carefully the\r\nbest way to get the resources that are required.\r\nThe Millennium Summit has also set priorities in\r\nterms of eradication of poverty and development.\r\nUnfortunately, we do not have at our disposal a set of\r\nrecommendations in the areas of poverty eradication\r\nand development that are comparable to those in the\r\nBrahimi report (A/55/305) in the area of peacekeeping.\r\nWe have pledged to halve, by the year 2015, the\r\nproportion of the world’s people whose income is less\r\nthat one dollar a day and the proportion of people who\r\nsuffer from hunger. But how are we supposed to do\r\nthat? Should we do that alone, at the national level?\r\nWhat kind of cooperation is required at the\r\ninternational level?\r\nIf we want globalization to be a blessing, and not\r\na curse on developing countries, we must tackle the\r\nflagrant imbalances in international flows of trade and\r\ninvestments. Efforts both at the international and\r\nnational levels are necessary. Increased international\r\ncooperation for development must be coupled with\r\nsound political systems and respect for human rights at\r\nthe national level.\r\nIn order to eradicate poverty, a more favourable\r\ninternational environment must be combined with a\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nrenewed national commitment to place the individual at\r\nthe centre of the development process.\r\nThe Millennium Summit proved that the United\r\nNations is the sole legitimate tool for international\r\naction. The Summit showed that the values and ideals\r\nembodied in the United Nations are by no means\r\noutmoded. The strengthening of the multilateral bodies\r\nis the only possible direction. Our task is therefore to\r\nmeet the expectations raised by the Summit through the\r\nreinvigoration of multilateralism in all its aspects.\r\nMr. Valdez Carrillo (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe delegation of Peru would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/55/1). His report depicts the situation\r\nof the United Nations in its different domains, as well\r\nas the challenges that the international community must\r\nconfront at the beginning of the new century.\r\nIt reminds us of the complexity of the task, with\r\nits economic, social, humanitarian and ultimately\r\npolitical dimensions, that we must tackle in this\r\nmillennium, as well as the importance that the Member\r\nStates of the United Nations, collectively and\r\nindividually, attach to stability, international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nFrom the beginning Peru has predicated its\r\nparticipation in the Organization on a firm commitment\r\nto the principles and objectives contained in the\r\nCharter. But even beyond that, my country has\r\nconsistently displayed the particular importance it\r\nattaches to multilateral action, whether regional or\r\nglobal, in resolving international problems.\r\nThis essentially principled attitude is supported\r\nby our activities at the bilateral level, and it is\r\ndisplayed in the agreements on the demarcation\r\nof borders and other issues relating to\r\ngood-neighbourliness that were pending with Ecuador\r\nand Chile. Along with our conviction about the\r\nimportance of peace, our steps in negotiations with\r\nthose countries were guided by a conviction concerning\r\nthe impact of these agreements on the social and\r\neconomic development of our countries and the region,\r\nas they would relax tension and reduce military\r\nspending.\r\nThis is why I would like to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the effort that the international\r\ncommunity must carry out in a gradual and realistic\r\nprocess moving towards general disarmament, which is\r\na moral and pragmatic imperative that we must always\r\nkeep in our sights. However, my delegation would like\r\nto reaffirm that in the final analysis overall security can\r\nonly be achieved through the equitable development of\r\nall nations. I would like to highlight the fact that there\r\nis no greater contribution to a lasting peace than the\r\npromotion of development. I would have liked to see in\r\nthe report a closer relation between these two lofty\r\nvalues.\r\nThe principles of the Charter conferred upon the\r\nUnited Nations a fundamental orientation, the scope\r\nand magnitude of which produce an ever-vital and\r\nforceful mandate for its organs. But, this mandate, with\r\nnew circumstances, has been developing through the\r\nemergence of new concepts and even interpretations of\r\nthe Charter, which can be seen through the practices of\r\nthe Security Council, such as preventive deployment.\r\nIn crafting the mandates for the establishment of\r\nsome peacekeeping operations, faithfulness to the\r\nprinciples of the Charter has not been evident, nor has\r\na respect for the specific tasks of each and every organ\r\nof the United Nations, particularly the General\r\nAssembly, which has the highest participation and\r\ntherefore is the most democratic organ in the system.\r\nMy delegation is also prepared to collaborate\r\nwith the new proposals of the Secretary-General and\r\nwill carefully study the proposals in the Brahimi report\r\nso as to render more effective the work of the United\r\nNations in this vital area aimed at protecting the\r\nsurvival of States and the security and well-being of\r\ntheir populations, as well as respect for their\r\nfundamental human rights.\r\nWe agree with the priority that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has attached to preventive action in\r\ninternational conflicts, as well as the importance of\r\nstrengthening the Secretariat in peacekeeping\r\noperations. However, my delegation wishes to call\r\nattention to the increase of costs consonant with the\r\nincrease of the number of operations and the excessive\r\nimpact these have on countries such as mine, when\r\ncosts, incurred without its participation, have to be\r\nfaced with tremendous difficulties.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express\r\nsolidarity with the great sacrifices of the staff of the\r\nUnited Nations, who have been praised for their efforts\r\nto preserve peace and respect for collective human\r\nrights, threatened as they have been in East Timor,\r\nSierra Leone, Congo, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Our country\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nhas a personal commitment to each one of these\r\nimportant activities of the Organization.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General in seeking new\r\nconsensus and new instruments and mechanisms to\r\nmake the United Nations more effective in complying\r\nand carrying out its fundamental mandate. The great\r\ncomplexity of the international scene confronts the\r\nUnited Nations with other domains of action which\r\ninvolve problems that are more of a social and\r\neconomic nature. We would like to have seen cases in\r\nwhich preventive diplomacy was used to resolve the\r\nproblems.\r\nThis intense activity of the United Nations in the\r\npreservation and building of peace shows that,\r\nunfortunately, the passing of the cold war has not\r\nbrought the peace dividend that the international\r\ncommunity had hoped for.\r\nOn the contrary, local conflicts have increased,\r\nparticularly in certain regions of the planet, like Africa,\r\nas the report has highlighted. We have also noted the\r\nnegative impact of globalization in the economic field,\r\nfor it has emphasized the gap between rich and poor.\r\nThis implies the danger of greater marginalization for a\r\nbroad swath of humanity, with respect to the positive\r\neconomic momentum that others are enjoying as a\r\nresult of the use of technology.\r\nIn this context of seeking new instruments and\r\nparameters for action, we must remember that\r\ncooperation for development remains the condition of\r\nsurvival for our countries as a decisive instrument in\r\nbringing about the well-being of our peoples, as set\r\nforth in the Charter.\r\nPeru agrees with the need to consider the\r\neradication of poverty as one of the most important\r\nobjectives of the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies, as the only international organization whose\r\nmandate includes peace, security, the well-being of\r\npopulations, development and human rights.\r\nThe United Nations has a unique opportunity to\r\ntackle comprehensively the eradication of poverty. All\r\nMember States have the responsibility to attain the\r\nobjective set out in the Millennium Declaration: to\r\nreduce absolute poverty by 50 per cent by 2015. Peru’s\r\nnational strategy has enabled us to halt, stabilize and\r\nreduce poverty levels. In Peru, the incidence of\r\nextreme poverty was reduced from 27 per cent to 14\r\nper cent between 1990 and 1997. Poor countries such\r\nas mine, which have been making a determined effort\r\nto solve this grave problem, cannot fail to be pleased\r\nthat the Organization is attaching growing importance\r\nto poverty reduction.\r\nPeru is gratified at the ever greater and more\r\neffective coordination among all United Nations bodies\r\non poverty eradication, and at the suitable follow-up to\r\nthe agreements reached at United Nations conferences\r\non social development issues. But I must make it clear\r\nthat this objective cannot in any way be de-linked from\r\nsustainable growth or from participatory social\r\ndevelopment focusing on the serious problem of\r\nunemployment, which is one of the major causes of\r\npoverty and of the deteriorating quality of life in our\r\ncountries. Hence, proper and ongoing consideration of\r\nmatters related to development financing, including\r\ntrade, is of enormous importance, because without the\r\nnecessary resources it will be impossible to attain our\r\neconomic-growth objectives along with social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nPeru would have preferred the report of the\r\nSecretary-General to have devoted more attention to\r\nthis important matter and to have laid greater stress on\r\nsuch substantive issues as protectionism in trade, the\r\nexcessive external-debt burden and the conditions for\r\nrepayment, and adequate levels of official development\r\nassistance that are commensurate with the\r\ncommitments made to us. Moreover, we would have\r\nliked to see more analysis of factors for foreign\r\ninvestment and, especially, of the inequities faced by\r\ndeveloping countries in the international financial,\r\nmonetary and trading system. All these matters, which\r\nare closely linked to issues of development, deserve\r\npriority attention from the United Nations.\r\nWe must also comment on the report’s material\r\non sustainable development. We fully agree with the\r\nobjectives set out in the report, and we agree that the\r\nproblems are complex and multifaceted. We are\r\npleased at the progress that has been made in a variety\r\nof very important areas, for example, with the\r\nnegotiation of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to\r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity.\r\nStill, we would have preferred a stronger\r\napproach to the commitments that have been made on\r\nclimate change, including a recommendation on the\r\nrapid entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol to the\r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange. We also have difficulties with the report’s\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\ncorrelation of environment and trade. These matters\r\ndeserve deeper study and careful treatment. Peru\r\ncannot accept it being so freely suggested that there is\r\ncomplementarity between the environment and trade\r\npolicy without the existence of clear consensus within\r\nthe World Trade Organization.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): Let me\r\nbegin by noting that today’s meeting on the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/55/1) is unique because it is taking place just\r\nfollowing the historic Millennium Summit, which\r\nbrought together in this very Hall an unprecedented\r\n150 heads of State or Government, who came to\r\ndiscuss the central issue of the role of the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century.\r\nIn his millennium report (A/54/2000), the\r\nSecretary-General wrote with great insight and\r\nrelevance of a vision of the Organization, with an\r\noverview of the many challenges and issues we\r\nabsolutely must confront as a community of nations.\r\nThe goal of the proposals and actions set out in that\r\nreport is to bring about peace, security, stability and\r\nactive solidarity among nations and among peoples.\r\nThe specific ideas and proposals that appear in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration will make possible an\r\nagreed vision for a United Nations that is better\r\nequipped and better able to confront the changing\r\nrealities of today’s world.\r\nOne of the great challenges facing this first\r\nsession of the new millennium obviously relates to our\r\nability to pool our efforts and our energies to ensure the\r\nprogressive and realistic implementation of the\r\ndecisions adopted by our heads of State or\r\nGovernment, in the context of a worldwide united\r\nfront. We must remember that the citizens of the world\r\nwere witness to the solemn commitments undertaken\r\nby our leaders, and that they all expect the resolutions\r\nand priorities adopted by those leaders to have an\r\nimpact on their daily lives. We must therefore feed the\r\nflame of the Summit and, most important, maintain the\r\n“millennium spirit”.\r\nTo that end, I wish to discuss a number of matters\r\nthat seem to be critical parts of our response to these\r\nissues. First of all, as observed by many of our heads of\r\nState or Government both during the Millennium\r\nSummit and during their round table discussions, the\r\nfirst challenge is globalization. That phenomenon has\r\ncreated a new situation in international relations by\r\neradicating national borders and forming a single\r\nspace, a global village whose heartbeat has a\r\nfundamental effect on the way our peoples live.\r\nGlobalization offers many opportunities but, for\r\nthe present, only a handful of rich countries are\r\nbenefiting from them, while the vast majority of\r\ncountries run the risk of increasing marginalization. We\r\nshould therefore try to make a united contribution to\r\nensure that the process becomes a positive force for all\r\nthe world’s peoples, and not a one-way phenomenon\r\nthat exacerbates injustice and inequity between the\r\nwealthy, prosperous and dominant North and a South\r\nthat grows ever poorer and that lacks any prospect of\r\nreal development.\r\nBecause the United Nations embodies the\r\naspiration of the world’s peoples to live in peace and\r\nachieve economic and social progress, it must urgently\r\nset about rectifying the process of globalization by\r\nsearching for appropriate solutions, perhaps through an\r\ninternational conference on globalization that would be\r\nintended first and foremost to encourage the\r\nglobalization of prosperity rather than the globalization\r\nof poverty.\r\nIt is also incumbent upon us to confront another\r\nchallenge, no less important: the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, which remains a\r\ndistant goal if we think of the many harmful and varied\r\nconflicts that are endangering the very structure of\r\nStates in many places, not to mention the suffering they\r\nimpose on civilian populations. My delegation will\r\nreturn to the causes of these conflicts, particularly\r\nthose that darken the skies of Africa, when the General\r\nAssembly examines the recommendations of the\r\nWorking Group on conflicts in Africa.\r\nI would just like to say today that these crises are\r\nfostered, fed and above all maintained by the illicit\r\nproliferation and the circulation of small arms and light\r\nweapons, as well as by anti-personnel mines.\r\nCombating these terrible scourges requires general\r\nmobilization, concerted actions and energetic\r\ninitiatives on our part to bring about their definitive\r\nelimination.\r\nIn the same vein, we must attach particular\r\nimportance to the Brahimi report (A/55/305) on United\r\nNations peace operations, whose recommendations set\r\nout very appropriate conditions for a better\r\npeacekeeping doctrine that is more in keeping with the\r\nrealities of today’s world.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is, in this\r\ncontext, another requirement, and it means\r\ntransforming that central organ, entrusted with the\r\npreservation of international peace and security, into a\r\nmore representative, democratic, transparent and\r\ncredible organ. My delegation will return to these\r\nissues when we consider the report of the Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform and the Brahimi\r\nreport.\r\nIf we wish to shape the United Nations into a\r\nmodern tool, capable of responding to the priorities of\r\nthe twenty-first century, we must quite obviously\r\nstrengthen the role of the General Assembly and\r\nrationalize the work of the other principal organs; but\r\nall Member States must also pay, without conditions\r\nand on time, their budgetary contributions.\r\nWe encourage the United Nations to continue,\r\nmore than it has in the past, to commit itself to\r\ncoordinating its activities with those of international\r\nfinancial institutions such as the International\r\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nToday we are living a grave paradox. It is\r\ncommonly said that never before has the world\r\naccumulated so much prosperity and advanced through\r\nso many stages of scientific and technical progress.\r\nNevertheless, more than 800 million people do not get\r\nenough to eat and 1.2 billion live in abject poverty,\r\nsuffering from illiteracy, unemployment, diseases and\r\npandemics such as AIDS and malaria.\r\nThis situation stabs our conscience, for we know\r\nthat the means to eradicate poverty and its related\r\nscourges exist and that all we need is a world coalition\r\ndriven by a genuine will to do something about this by\r\nincreasing official development assistance, cancelling\r\ndebt and coordinating the struggle against all the major\r\ndiseases.\r\nAt the dawn of this new century and in the spirit\r\nof the Millennium Declaration, the Member States of\r\nour Organization must concretely forge an alliance or\r\ncreate a new partnership for development to make the\r\ntwenty-first century the century of the world coalition\r\nfor shared prosperity. This is a daring challenge that we\r\nmust meet if we wish to build a fairer and more\r\nequitable new international human order. It is also a\r\nreasonable step to take if we truly wish to contribute to\r\neliminating the causes of conflicts, and therefore\r\ninstability in the world.\r\nIn conclusion, as our heads of State and\r\nGovernment have done before me, gathered here in the\r\nsolemn framework of the Millennium Summit, I wish\r\nto emphasize and reaffirm once again the irreplaceable\r\nrole of the United Nations in the new ordering of the\r\npolitical, economic and cultural life of our global\r\nsociety. The United Nations and its system can help\r\nmake this global society more humane by devising\r\nsolutions that will guide the future of humanity.\r\nWe have no choice today but to take this road of\r\nhope that necessarily passes through the consolidation\r\nof multilateralism and universalism.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): My delegation is grateful\r\nto the Secretary-General for his comprehensive and\r\nthoughtful report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/55/1). We commend him for raising important\r\nissues of concern to the international community, even\r\nwhen a number of them may be contentious. They must\r\nbe seriously addressed by Member States, especially in\r\nthe light of the expectations raised during the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nClearly, in spite of ongoing efforts, challenges to\r\nthe Organization remain, especially in situations of\r\ncrisis in many parts of the world. In facing these crises,\r\nthere should be more concerted efforts on the part of\r\nthe international community to pool resources and to\r\ncoordinate responses for maximum impact. Clearly,\r\nalso building a culture of prevention, as has been\r\nespoused by the Secretary-General, is much more\r\nbeneficial, long-lasting and less costly than reacting to\r\ndisasters, whether natural or man-made.\r\nIncreased and more effective cooperation and\r\ncoordination among the various United Nations and\r\nother international agencies is especially important in\r\nresponding to these many challenges. However, these\r\nresponses must be made in a way that will not expose\r\nthe United Nations to charges of selectivity or bias.\r\nThis is important to ensure the credibility of and\r\nrespect for the Organization.\r\nThe Secretary-General has also touched on the\r\n“dilemma of intervention” and noted the strong\r\nreactions by Member States to the issue of\r\nhumanitarian intervention, which he had first raised in\r\nhis report to the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly. He was right in saying that in essence the\r\nproblem is one of responsibility in the face of massive\r\nviolation of human rights when human lives are at\r\nstake. This is a question that we must ponder together,\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nand we must come to a general understanding on what\r\nought to be our collective response to these situations.\r\nClearly, the international community cannot sit idly by\r\nin the face of such massive humanitarian tragedies.\r\nAgainst this, however, is the imperative to adhere to\r\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter,\r\nparticularly relating to the principles of non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States and respect\r\nfor their sovereignty.\r\nThe challenge before us is to strike a proper\r\nbalance so as to ensure that while human lives are\r\nsaved, State sovereignty is not being trampled\r\nunderfoot. We continue to believe that while the issue\r\nis a contentious one, there should be a frank and in-\r\ndepth discussion of the concept. We believe in\r\ngenerating a healthy debate on the subject, not in\r\nstifling it. However, in doing so we must be guided by\r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter and must not put\r\nthem aside, as they provide the very basis upon which\r\nthe United Nations was founded. Support for human\r\nrights should not be at the expense of the sovereign\r\nrights of States.\r\nThe Secretary-General is to be commended for\r\nestablishing the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations, chaired by Ambassador Brahimi, for the\r\npurpose of undertaking a major review of United\r\nNations peace operations and recommending\r\nimprovements to existing arrangements. We commend\r\nthe Panel for its comprehensive report and bold\r\nrecommendations, which deserve the serious and\r\nurgent consideration of Member States. We agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General and the Panel that United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations must be drastically\r\nrevamped to ensure their effectiveness and viability in\r\nthe context of the contemporary conflict situations in\r\nwhich they operate. Clearly, much needs to be done,\r\nnot the least of which is the urgent need to strengthen\r\nthe severely understaffed Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations with the requisite human resources. Equally\r\nimportant is the need to increase resources for effective\r\npeacekeeping on the ground, both in terms of its\r\nfinancing and in the availability of troops contributed\r\nby Member States.\r\nIn the final analysis, the viability of peacekeeping\r\noperations rests on the twin issues of money and\r\npeople. Current and future peacekeeping operations are\r\na dynamic process. They have become increasingly\r\nmultidisciplinary in character in response to the\r\nincreasingly complex nature of contemporary conflicts.\r\nWe believe that a multidisciplinary or holistic approach\r\nwould address not only the symptoms of conflicts but,\r\nmore importantly, their underlying causes, which are\r\noften socio-economic in nature.\r\nSanctions remain a legitimate and legal\r\ninstrument to coerce States to conform to\r\ninternationally accepted behaviour and norms of inter-\r\nState conduct. Unfortunately, they often exert a heavy\r\ntoll on the populace, as is graphically illustrated by the\r\ncontinuing grave humanitarian situation in Iraq today.\r\nThe international community must come to grips with\r\nthis issue, so as to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi\r\npeople, even as it addresses the question of peace and\r\nsecurity and the unresolved issues of Kuwaiti and\r\nthird-country missing nationals and Kuwaiti property.\r\nAll of those issues must be brought to closure if\r\nnormalcy is to return to that region.\r\nMy delegation is encouraged by the current\r\nefforts in the Security Council to move in the direction\r\nof more focused and targeted sanctions — the so-called\r\nsmart sanctions — and to turn away from debilitating\r\ncomprehensive sanctions, which clearly are a form of\r\ncollective punishment. Sanctions in the future — if,\r\nand when, imposed as absolutely necessary — should\r\nhave specific objectives, be clearly targeted and have\r\nspecified timeframes. They should be lifted as soon as\r\nthey have served their purpose and are no longer\r\npertinent to the situation, as should have been done in\r\nrespect of the sanctions imposed on Libya and the\r\nSudan.\r\nDisarmament will remain a matter of paramount\r\nimportance to the international community for as long\r\nas weapons — whether nuclear or conventional —\r\nremain the main threat to peace, security and the well\r\nbeing of humanity on the planet. My delegation is\r\nparticularly concerned by the threat posed by weapons\r\nof mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons but\r\nalso chemical and biological ones. We should be even\r\nmore resolved during this century to work collectively\r\nfor their complete elimination. In that regard, we\r\nstrongly commend the Secretary-General for drawing\r\nattention to the dangers posed by the development and\r\ntesting of long-range missiles, as well as to the danger\r\nposed by the possible deployment of national missile\r\ndefences. We share the concern of many countries that\r\nthe deployment of such a defence system could\r\nprecipitate a new arms race and undermine nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation efforts.\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nMy delegation continues to attach importance to\r\nthe historic Advisory Opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice on the legality of the threat and use of\r\nnuclear weapons. We regret that, to date, there has been\r\nvery little serious effort to pursue in good faith and\r\nconclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.\r\nEfforts in that direction at the Conference on\r\nDisarmament continue to be thwarted by the nuclear-\r\nweapon States. The prospects of a nuclear-free world\r\nhave become even more dismal with the arrival on the\r\nscene of new nuclear Powers.\r\nWhile we welcome the outcome of the 2000\r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in particular\r\nthe unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear-weapon\r\nStates towards the total elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons, we remain highly sceptical about the political\r\nwill to follow up on those commitments. The track\r\nrecord of the nuclear-weapon States does not inspire\r\nmuch confidence; it is long in promises but rather short\r\nin performance. It remains for the rest of us who do not\r\nhave, and do not want to have, nuclear weapons to\r\nmaintain and sustain the campaign for a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. In that regard, we should strongly\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s call for the convening\r\nof an international conference to address the issue of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nIn the realm of conventional weapons, we\r\ncontinue to be dismayed and alarmed by the\r\nproliferation and flow of conventional weapons,\r\nincluding small arms, to developing countries, thereby\r\nfuelling the wars of the third world, such as those in\r\nAfrica, whose wars have been characterized by the use\r\nof not only small arms but also ever-more sophisticated\r\nhi-tech conventional weapons, thanks to the aggressive\r\nmarketing by the arms merchants of the developed\r\ncountries. We therefore look forward to the upcoming\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which we\r\nhope will address this category of weapons that,\r\nincidentally, have killed the greatest number of people\r\nin the history of human conflict.\r\nActs of violence against civilians, which are\r\nincreasing in number, are clearly unacceptable to the\r\ninternational community and must be strongly\r\ncondemned whenever and wherever they occur. Those\r\nresponsible for those dastardly crimes must be brought\r\nto book, either through the national justice systems of\r\nthe countries in which those crimes are committed or,\r\nwhenever and wherever appropriate, through the\r\nrelevant international criminal tribunals. Until a global\r\nenforcement mechanism is in place to address those\r\ncrimes, ad hoc tribunals may be required, as and\r\nwhenever necessary, as in the case of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and\r\nRwanda. Those international tribunals and the criminal\r\ntribunal to be established in respect of Sierra Leone\r\nshould be strongly supported by the international\r\ncommunity, thereby sending a clear and unambiguous\r\nmessage to potential perpetrators.\r\nAttacks on United Nations and international\r\nhumanitarian personnel in the field have also been on\r\nthe increase in recent times. Those acts must be\r\ncondemned in the strongest terms. The Organization\r\nmust ensure the safety of personnel as they carry out\r\ntheir noble and selfless tasks in the name of humanity.\r\nWe have in the past called for appropriate\r\nacknowledgement of their contribution by the United\r\nNations, in appreciation of their service. Given the\r\nsacrifices they have made, and will continue to make in\r\nthe name of humanity, we think it fitting that they be\r\nhonoured in the appropriate way by the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General has drawn attention to the\r\ncosts and benefits of globalization, which continues to\r\nbe the subject of much debate in this and other\r\ninternational forums. Clearly, globalization is not a\r\npanacea, but a challenge to many developing countries,\r\nas they begin to integrate their economies into the\r\nlarger world economy. Indeed, the deepening divisions\r\nand development gaps of the contemporary world in\r\nthe wake of globalization have become even more stark\r\nand critical and are a matter of serious concern. If not\r\naddressed appropriately, instead of closing the gap\r\nbetween the rich and poor nations, globalization will\r\nwiden it even further, with dire consequences for\r\ndeveloping countries and the health of the world\r\neconomy. That would certainly be a severe setback to\r\nthe progress made thus far. For globalization to be\r\naccepted by all we will have to ensure the effective\r\nparticipation of all countries in the global trading\r\nsystem and the integration of their social and\r\ndevelopment objectives within global economic and\r\nfinancial strategies.\r\nMy delegation is gratified by the continuing\r\npreoccupation with, and the debate on, the\r\nglobalization issue, as it reflects the deep concern\r\nabout its effects and impact on the international\r\ncommunity, particularly on developing countries.\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nThose debates here at the United Nations, particularly\r\nat the Millennium Summit and in other international\r\nforums such as the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization, have sensitised developed\r\ncountries to the vulnerabilities of the countries of the\r\nSouth. Hopefully, this will engender greater\r\nunderstanding of the problems faced by the countries\r\nof the developing world.\r\nIn this regard, we would therefore encourage the\r\nUnited Nations to continue to engage these institutions\r\nin an ongoing dialogue on these and other important\r\nissues. We believe the United Nations can, and should,\r\nplay a pivotal role in helping to develop an\r\ninternational consensus on many of these issues.\r\nWe cannot deny the intrinsic linkage between\r\nglobalization and development in all its aspects. It is\r\nclear that, while global market forces can generate\r\nwealth and prosperity, they can also lead to political\r\ntensions and instability when the impact on\r\ndevelopment is patchy or uneven.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation looks forward to the\r\nupcoming international conference on financing for\r\ndevelopment, which should address the issue of the\r\ndevelopment needs of developing countries,\r\nparticularly those in Africa and the least developed\r\ncountries in other regions. This conference should, as a\r\nmatter of top priority, consider ways and means of\r\nfinancing development in the context of the rapidly\r\nglobalized economy. It should be animated by the\r\nphilosophy of enlightened self-interest and the\r\nproposition that a more prosperous world would be to\r\nthe benefit of all.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The fundamental provisions of the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General attest to the fact that the United\r\nNations — as the President of the Russian Federation,\r\nMr. Vladimir Putin, stated at the Millennium\r\nSummit — has learned to resolve, and is resolving, the\r\nworld’s most complex problems.\r\nThe highest-level representatives of the\r\ninternational community confirmed, during that\r\nhistoric event, that the United Nations is continuing to\r\nplay a central role in ensuring peace and stability on\r\nboth the global and regional level.\r\nWe have always believed, and we continue to\r\nbelieve, that a strong and capable United Nations is a\r\nkey instrument in the search for collective responses to\r\nthe challenges of our time. We consider the\r\nOrganization as an irreplaceable forum for the\r\nresolution of global problems of security and\r\ncooperation, for the formation of a stable, multipolar\r\nand democratic world order.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s view that the\r\nachievement of sustainable peace and security for all\r\ncountries and peoples remains as important an\r\nobjective of the United Nations on the threshold of the\r\ntwenty-first century as it was at the time of the\r\nestablishment of the Organization more than half a\r\ncentury ago. At the same time, we have no grounds to\r\nbe complacent. This refers first and foremost to the\r\nmultifaceted activity of the United Nations on\r\npeacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nPeacekeeping operations indisputably remain one\r\nof the high priority areas of activity of the\r\nOrganization. However, today’s large-scale problems in\r\nthe hotbeds ranging from Africa to the Balkans and to\r\nEast Timor require a radical improvement of the\r\npeacekeeping potential of the United Nations. Russia,\r\nfor its part, intends actively to promote this.\r\nThe Millennium Summit and Assembly have\r\nindicated ways to enhance the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations in preventing and settling conflicts in\r\nthe world. This, inter alia, was the goal of the\r\nrecommendations in the report by the Brahimi panel\r\nunder the aegis of the Secretary-General. We share the\r\nbasic approach, as stated in that document, which\r\nobviously will become the subject of comprehensive\r\ndiscussion at this session.\r\nIn our view, it is extremely important to step-up\r\nand enhance United Nations possibilities for effective\r\ndeployment of peacekeeping forces. It is obvious that\r\nin order to accomplish this it is necessary to achieve\r\nthe speediest possible conclusion of the formation of\r\nthe stand-by agreement system.\r\nWe cannot fail to agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the peacekeeping structures of the United\r\nNations Secretariat, and, especially, the Department of\r\nPeace-keeping Operations, needs to be strengthened.\r\nWe are in agreement with those who believe that\r\nthe international community cannot stand by on the\r\nsidelines and look at the pain and suffering of\r\nthousands of people and the systematic and gross\r\ntrampling underfoot of their humanitarian rights.\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nUnquestionably there is a need to take into account the\r\nlessons of the tragedies in Srebrenica and Rwanda.\r\nAt the same time, we are convinced that it is\r\nimpossible to achieve a cessation of violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law through actions which\r\nrun counter to the Charter. It is appropriate to recall\r\nthat in the final documents of the Millennium Summit\r\nand meetings of the Security Council at the highest\r\nlevel, there was a reaffirmation of the entire\r\ninternational community’s dedication to the\r\nstrengthening of peace and security in accordance with\r\nthe principles and purposes of the Charter. It was also\r\nemphasized that interaction of the United Nations with\r\nthe regional organizations must be carried out on the\r\nbasis of Chapter VIII of the Charter. This means an\r\nunambiguous reaffirmation of the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Council in sanctioning the use of\r\nforce in international relations. Otherwise, the world\r\nwill slip towards anarchy and lawlessness when\r\nattempts are made to impose order through the right of\r\nforce under cover of the concept of humanitarian\r\nintervention and limited sovereignty. In case of threats\r\nor faits accomplis of mass violations of fundamental\r\nhuman rights, the international community must act\r\njointly in accordance with the decision of the Security\r\nCouncil and in strict compliance with the Charter. That,\r\nin our view, is the essence of the answer to the\r\ndilemma of intervention formulated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report to the Millennium Summit.\r\nWe favour the development of norms of\r\ninternational law applicable to the search for effective\r\nresponses to the humanitarian challenges of our time.\r\nWork on the adaptation of international legal norms to\r\nnew realities must be conducted on a collective basis\r\nand on the solid basis of the Charter. Only in that way\r\nis it possible to draw up general, clear and universally\r\nacceptable criteria, and a legal framework for coercive\r\nactions on the part of the international community in\r\nthe case of emergency humanitarian situations.\r\nWe share the assessments of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral regarding the growing significance of\r\npreventive diplomacy — a strengthening of the culture\r\nof conflict prevention which is now coming to replace\r\nthe culture of response. The international community\r\nhas acquired a unique arsenal of political and\r\ndiplomatic means to resolve virtually any international\r\nproblems. Effective use must be made of it. Work to\r\nprevent and to settle through political diplomatic\r\nmeans all kinds of crises must become a central\r\nelement of international security in the twenty-first\r\ncentury — a central element of efforts to ensure\r\nstrategic stability.\r\nWe believe it is important to continue in-depth\r\nconsideration of the concept of post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding. We fully agree with the conclusion of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report regarding the need to\r\nimprove the procedure for the application of Security\r\nCouncil sanctions in order to enhance the effectiveness\r\nand flexibility of sanctions regimes. Sanctions are an\r\nextremely powerful means for deterring and preventing\r\nconflicts and demand a particularly cautious approach.\r\nI should like once again to emphasize that\r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council should not\r\nbecome a means for punishing countries and peoples,\r\nas has unfortunately been the case all too often. In\r\nimposing them there needs to be complete clarity of\r\nobjectives, timely agreement on clear conditions and\r\nmechanisms for lifting them, and the possibility for a\r\ngradual easing. Sanctions should not lead to\r\ndestabilization of the economic situation, either within\r\nthe country that is the objective of the sanctions, or in\r\nthird countries.\r\nAlso deserving of our attention is the strategic\r\npolicy for the Organization in the area of development,\r\nwhich was emphasized in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, aimed at the elimination of poverty and which\r\nprovides for the conducting of effective national policy\r\nin the social sphere. Of particular importance is the\r\nactivity of the United Nations to ensure a fairer\r\ndistribution of benefits from globalization among all\r\ncountries, inter alia, through ensuring the effective\r\nparticipation of each of them in the international trade\r\nsystem, the strengthening of international financial\r\nsystems in order to counteract the emergence of crises\r\nand to improve access to financial resources for\r\npurposes of development.\r\nAs noted in the report, the growth, number and\r\nthe scale of natural disasters requires broader\r\ninternational cooperation in the areas of rendering\r\nassistance to populations who have suffered. The\r\nobjective — as is quite rightly stated — should be to\r\nstep up the use of scientific and technical achievements\r\nwith a view to reducing the danger of such disasters.\r\nOnce again, we would like to draw attention to\r\nthe Russian proposals aimed at enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of the international potential for\r\nresponding to natural and man-made disasters. We\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.29\r\nbelieve that, at the outset, the United Nations ought to\r\nmake an inventory of the existing potential in this field\r\non a country, regional and international level and on\r\nthis basis produce practical recommendations.\r\nThe report rightly emphasizes the intensification\r\nof the interaction and complementarity of issues\r\ntouching on the environment, trade and development.\r\nThe task of developing the ecological components of\r\nthe Global Compact is equally pressing. We consider it\r\nnecessary to keep this issue at the centre of the United\r\nNations attention.\r\nWe endorse the thesis set forth in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report to the effect that the commonwealth of\r\nnations is obliged to act in the face of gross violations\r\nof human rights. We have clearly seen many instances\r\nof how inaction has led, inter alia, to the growing\r\nbrutality of discrimination against our compatriots in\r\nsome of the post-Soviet States and to the justification\r\nand glorification of fascism. The protection of human\r\nrights should be based on universally applicable norms,\r\nrather than on political expediency and geostrategic\r\naspirations.\r\nRussia actively supports the enhanced attention of\r\nthe United Nations to the problems of fighting\r\ninternational terrorism, crime and the illicit drug trade.\r\nThroughout this session, we will contribute in every\r\npossible way to broadening the legal basis of anti-\r\nterrorism cooperation and to the adoption of the\r\nconvention on transnational organized crime. The\r\nOrganization should be more active in its anti-\r\ncorruption work and in creating a universal legal basis\r\nfor inter-State cooperation in that field.\r\nIn general, the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nwhile stimulating creative discussion on ways further\r\nto improve the United Nations, confirms yet again the\r\nthesis that the relevance and capacity of the\r\nOrganization’s goals and principles to inspire have in\r\nno way diminished, but have, if anything, increased.\r\nThe results of the Millennium Summit and Assembly\r\nrequire us all to coordinate practical measures to ensure\r\nmore effective use of this unique forum and\r\nirreplaceable mechanism of inter-State\r\nintercommunication and conflict settlement in our\r\ncommon interests.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
