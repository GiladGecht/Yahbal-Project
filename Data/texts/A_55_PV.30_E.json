(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/55/1)\r\nMr. Aboulgheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): As is\r\nhis custom every year, the Secretary-General made it a\r\npoint to include in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization his vision of the most important issues\r\nand problems facing the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community. I would like to pay tribute to\r\nthe comprehensive nature of the report and to seize this\r\nopportunity to refer to several points that were raised in\r\nthe report.\r\nThe Secretary-General has devoted a large part of\r\nthis report to the situation in Africa. We welcome the\r\nincreasing concern about Africa within the United\r\nNations and its main bodies and agencies. We believe,\r\nhowever, that the gap remains very large between what\r\nthe international community intends and pledges to do\r\nin order to prevent and settle the conflicts on the\r\nAfrican continent, and the actual steps taken in\r\nassuming the collective responsibility to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security in Africa and to deal\r\nwith the actual root causes of those conflicts, which\r\nhave wreaked havoc on the political, economic and\r\nsocial infrastructures in that continent.\r\nConcerning the Horn of Africa, Egypt looks\r\nforward to the deployment of the United Nations\r\nMission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) so that a\r\nnecessary political climate for confidence-building can\r\nbe created between those two sister countries and the\r\nway paved to a peace agreement between them.\r\nEgypt looks forward to renewed impetus on the\r\npart of the international community to promote efforts\r\nto establish peace in Somalia, particularly since we are\r\nnow at a decisive phase that requires all the efforts of\r\nthe international community.\r\nAs for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we\r\nhope that all the parties will create the necessary\r\nconditions for moving to the second phase of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and\r\nallow further progress towards the solution of this\r\ncrisis.\r\nThe Egyptian delegation believes that the\r\nresponse of the United Nations to the present crisis in\r\nSierra Leone will reflect the commitment of the\r\ninternational community to its responsibilities in Africa\r\nand will certainly affect directly the future role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity on the African continent. That is why we look\r\nforward to seeing the Organization expand the military\r\ncomponent of the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone (UNAMSIL) and to seeing the international\r\ncommunity respect the embargo on illicit trafficking in\r\ndiamonds, while contributing generously towards the\r\nefforts to reconstruct Sierra Leone and its national\r\narmed forces.\r\nConcerning United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations, the recommendations contained in the\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nreport of the Panel of experts set up by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to study those operations, under the\r\nchairmanship of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, form an\r\nimportant and natural part of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the work of the Organization this year. Egypt\r\nis fully aware of the importance of those\r\nrecommendations and of their long-term effects on the\r\nperformance of the international Organization in the\r\narea of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. We look forward to detailed discussions on\r\nthe recommendations in the relevant committees of the\r\nGeneral Assembly with other Member States in order\r\nto reach a consensus on the best approach to take.\r\nIn this respect, I should like to point out that the\r\nMember States contributing to the peacekeeping\r\noperations — and Egypt is one of them — should\r\nconsider the reform of that particular area of the work\r\nof the United Nations as very important. We believe\r\nthat United Nations peacekeeping operations should be\r\neffective from the point of view of timing, deployment\r\nand operational efficiency. We would prefer, if\r\npossible, that the United Nations carry out\r\npeacekeeping operations rather than arrangements that\r\nare not relevant to it. The United Nations continues to\r\nbe the only legitimate international forum, accepted by\r\nall, for peoples to work through.\r\nI should like to refer to the statement made by the\r\nSecretary-General concerning the HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nin the world, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular.\r\nThe figures contained in the report and in reports of\r\nother United Nations agencies indicate that there is a\r\nvery serious social dimension to the spread of that\r\ndisease. I refer not only to the frightening rate at which\r\nit is spreading — it affects 25 per cent of the\r\npopulation in some States of the continent — but also\r\nto the fact that it is affecting people of middle age,\r\nwhich will have an impact on the future of society and\r\nthreatens the development of the continent. That is why\r\nEgypt is particularly interested in convening a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly to discuss the problem\r\nof AIDS in all its aspects. Our delegation participated\r\neffectively in the deliberations that preceded the\r\nadoption by the General Assembly of resolution 54/283\r\nconcerning the convening of that special session, and\r\nmade it a point also to become one of the co-sponsors\r\nof the resolution.\r\nFor that reason, Egypt calls on all delegations and\r\nStates to display a spirit of cooperation for holding that\r\nspecial session as soon as possible in order to examine\r\nways and means of pooling international resources to\r\ntackle that very serious disease.\r\nAs for the sanctions, we welcome the proposals\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General in his report,\r\nbecause they parallel what my delegation and others\r\nhave repeatedly affirmed. We would like to stress the\r\nimportance of assessing the effectiveness of those\r\nsanctions in order to discern whether they truly\r\npromote the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations and to take stock of their impact on targeted\r\nStates at the regional and national levels.\r\nWe have often stressed the fact that sanctions\r\nshould be an exceptional measure and a last resort, in\r\nconformity with Chapter VII of the Charter, and should\r\nbe imposed only after all other means of peacefully\r\nsettling conflicts have been exhausted, in accordance\r\nwith Chapter VI. We stress also the fact that sanctions\r\nshould be imposed in accordance with objective, open,\r\nfixed and agreed criteria and for a given period of time,\r\nso that they do not become eternal shackles.\r\nWe have often called attention to the negative\r\nside effects of sanctions applied under Chapter VII —\r\nbe they on the people of the targeted State, or on third\r\nparties whose interests are closely linked to those of\r\nthe State in question, particularly neighbouring\r\ncountries. In this regard, we were very interested in\r\nwhat the Secretary-General said in his report about the\r\nneed to re-examine the concept of sanctions, and we\r\ncontinue to call for the lifting of sanctions and for the\r\napplication of the relevant Articles of the Charter, in\r\nparticular Article 50.\r\nWe congratulate you, Sir, and your friendly\r\ncountry on your election to preside over this session.\r\nWe are confident that your well-known expertise and\r\ncapabilities will enhance and ensure its success. I again\r\nassure you of our delegation’s cooperation to ensure\r\nthe success of the session.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): I wish to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his statement and for\r\npresenting us with his annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe debate on what the international community\r\nshould collectively do to address the concerns and\r\nissues before us comes at an opportune time, when our\r\nheads of State and Government have just concluded\r\ntheir Summit. We should now give effect to the\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\ncommitments they made in their Declaration. We\r\nshould begin with our Organization itself.\r\nThere are two important elements in any reform\r\nof the United Nations: first, the restoration of the\r\nprimacy of the General Assembly in United Nations\r\naffairs; and, secondly, making the Security Council\r\nmore representative of the United Nations membership\r\nand more transparent in its working methods.\r\nThe General Assembly is, and should remain, the\r\nprincipal body in the United Nations for deliberation\r\non issues of international concern. It is where the\r\nsovereign equality of nations finds full expression.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations would not be\r\nconcluded without an effective reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Its membership must reflect the increase both\r\nin numbers and diversity of the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. Even more important, the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process must reflect the principle of\r\nthe sovereign equality of all States, which is the\r\ncornerstone of the United Nations. While the Open-\r\nended Working Group has made tremendous efforts to\r\nachieve Security Council reform, it must complete its\r\nwork soon.\r\nThe United Nations must be given all the\r\nresources required to enhance its effectiveness in\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. Emphasis\r\nshould be placed on conflict prevention. At a time\r\nwhen United Nations resources are stretched to the\r\nlimits, preventive diplomacy presents a more cost-\r\neffective option than peacekeeping, which some\r\nestimate would require $3 billion to $4 billion a year to\r\nmaintain in the coming years. But for as long as\r\nconflicts continue to erupt the United Nations should\r\nstrengthen its peacekeeping capacity. The Philippines\r\nwill remain fully engaged in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping missions to the extent that its resources\r\nallow.\r\nThe United Nations should seriously consider the\r\nrecommendations of the Brahimi Panel and support its\r\nconstructive suggestions, which would improve United\r\nNations peace operations. The United Nations must\r\nensure that United Nations peace operations are\r\nadequately financed and supported by Member States.\r\nThe Philippines is concerned about the adverse\r\nimpact of sanctions on innocent civilian populations.\r\nThe United Nations should help eliminate these\r\nnegative effects and call for periodic and regular\r\nreviews of existing sanction regimes. The Security\r\nCouncil should only impose sanctions that are\r\n“targeted” and “smart”, so as to spare innocent civilian\r\npopulations from unnecessary suffering.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to promote\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law in all the countries of\r\nthe world. It should be committed to the consolidation\r\nof representative democracy as a system of government\r\nfor all. Political pluralism balanced by good\r\ngovernance and the ethical discharge of public duties\r\nmust form part of the United Nations core values.\r\nDemocracy, the rule of law and the effective\r\nparticipation of citizens in all the nations of the world\r\nmust be a rallying point for all the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe United Nations should be relentless in the\r\npromotion of human rights around the world. The\r\nprinciple must be upheld that Governments should,\r\nfirst and foremost, safeguard and protect the\r\nfundamental rights of their citizens. Only an\r\nunwavering commitment by all to the promotion of\r\nhuman rights will prevent a recurrence of the\r\nhumanitarian catastrophes witnessed in the last decade.\r\nThe United Nations Charter principles on the\r\nsovereign equality of all its Members and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of one another\r\nshould continue to be upheld. Any armed intervention,\r\nno matter how justifiable, must be carried out only with\r\nthe authority of the Security Council if a modicum of\r\ninternational order is to be maintained.\r\nThe General Assembly should make a concerted\r\neffort to respond to, if not totally eliminate, the menace\r\nof HIV/AIDS. The response to the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic requires cooperation, not competition, by all\r\nthe relevant United Nations agencies and non-\r\ngovernmental bodies. It demands collective action by\r\nall.\r\nThe United Nations should make special efforts\r\nto address the critical problems of the African\r\ncontinent. A higher proportion of the populations of\r\nsub-Saharan Africa are affected by poverty than in any\r\nother region of the world. Africa is also affected by a\r\nhigh incidence of HIV/AIDS. These combined\r\nhardships are ravaging the region in a manner not seen\r\nanywhere else. Therefore, specific measures for debt\r\ncancellation, increased official development assistance,\r\nincreased flows of foreign direct investment and\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nimproved market access should be established\r\nspecifically for Africa.\r\nMy delegation will continue to participate in the\r\nwork of the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. We view the discussions\r\non the crime of aggression as having particular\r\nimportance.\r\nThe Philippines supports the goal of preventing\r\nimpunity and bringing perpetrators of war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity to the bar of justice. But we\r\nwill continue to evaluate whether the Court would be\r\nan effective tool to achieve the goals set for it. My\r\ndelegation will also look closely at how the Court will\r\nbe financed. And we will continue our study of the\r\ncritical issue of the Court’s jurisdiction.\r\nI join others in recognizing the success of the\r\nrecently concluded year 2000 Review Conference of\r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. We welcome the outcome of this\r\nreview, particularly the reaffirmation by the five\r\npermanent members of the Security Council of their\r\nnuclear disarmament obligations. However, we express\r\nour hopes for the early and meaningful implementation\r\nof these obligations.\r\nWhile there are several established multilateral\r\nvenues that deal with various aspects of the nuclear\r\nissue, it may be time to deal with it in a comprehensive\r\nand focused manner. I urge all of us to take charge of\r\npreserving our future and to support the proposal of the\r\nSecretary-General, contained in his millennium report,\r\nthat consideration be given to convening a major\r\ninternational conference that would help identify ways\r\nof eliminating nuclear dangers.\r\nWe support the proposal to hold an international\r\nconference in 2001 to address the issue of small arms\r\nproliferation. Excess weapons must be destroyed where\r\nthey are found. Their easy movement must be curtailed.\r\nNational arsenals should have only the weapons they\r\nneed for legitimate self-defence.\r\nAt the same time, we should continue to\r\nstrengthen the regime established by the landmine\r\nConvention. Even before its conclusion the Philippines,\r\nfully aware of the humanitarian consequences of the\r\nuse of anti-personnel landmines, had already\r\nabandoned the use of these weapons. We call on all\r\nStates that have not yet done so to become parties to\r\nthe Convention. The Philippines also supports all\r\nefforts at landmine clearance and victim rehabilitation.\r\nWe must ensure the success of the forthcoming\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries by convening an additional\r\nmeeting of the Intergovernmental Preparatory\r\nCommittee. We owe it to our brothers in Africa, in\r\nlandlocked developing countries, in nations particularly\r\nvulnerable to natural disasters, in small island\r\ndeveloping States and in my own region of Asia to\r\ndedicate ourselves to focus the world’s interest on least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWe must also ensure the success of the High-\r\nLevel International Intergovernmental Event on\r\nFinancing for Development. We must pay particular\r\nattention so that all stakeholders in the process develop\r\na strong sense of ownership and together we can make\r\nthe international financial system development-\r\noriented and responsive to the needs of the majority of\r\nhumanity.\r\nWe also cannot allow globalization to continue\r\nwithout giving developing countries a chance to catch\r\nup. We must not only bring about a more humane\r\neconomic system, but must find means to bridge the\r\ndigital divide that now separates the rich from the poor.\r\nIt must be stressed that for effective humanitarian\r\nassistance to continue the political will to provide the\r\nnecessary resources, including financial resources,\r\nmust be present. Moreover, protection of humanitarian\r\nrelief workers must be assured. We pay tribute to the\r\nmany men and women who have lost their lives, and\r\nthose who, in spite of serious danger, are willing to\r\nsacrifice theirs to bring relief and assistance to\r\nunfortunate fellow men.\r\nThe declarations and further actions agreed upon\r\nat the special sessions to review progress in the\r\ncommitments made in Beijing and Copenhagen to\r\nempower women and achieve social development,\r\nrespectively, are testimony to the firm determination of\r\nthe international community to achieve social\r\ndevelopment and improve the status of women. What is\r\nessential now is to put these commitments into action\r\nso that the goals set in Copenhagen and Beijing may be\r\nachieved.\r\nThe Philippines welcomes the attention given in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report to the problem of\r\ntrafficking in human beings, particularly women and\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\ngirls, as a priority area that must be addressed. In a\r\nrelated sense, the Philippines will be introducing an\r\nupdated draft resolution that will incorporate\r\ncommitments made in the special session of the\r\nBeijing +5 review.\r\nFinally, as we can see, there is much to be done. I\r\nam confident that together we will succeed.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): I would like first to express my\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for submitting the\r\nreport on the work of the Organization to the Assembly\r\nat the current session. It provides us with\r\ncomparatively detailed information on the activities of\r\nthe United Nations relating to international peace and\r\nsecurity, development, human rights and other fields\r\nduring the period under review. On the basis of the\r\nreport, I would like to present the following views.\r\nOn the threshold of the new century, the first and\r\nforemost task facing the United Nations is to establish\r\njust international relations based on the principles of\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of Member States and non-\r\ninterference in others’ internal affairs.\r\nThe new concept of “humanitarian intervention”\r\nwhich emerged soon after the strike on Yugoslavia last\r\nyear gives rise to serious concern among many\r\ncountries as a grave challenge to the supreme principle\r\nof respect for sovereignty that should be observed in\r\ninternational relations. This concept of “humanitarian\r\nintervention” is based on the notion that power is\r\nalmighty and therefore, if this is allowed, it will\r\nconvert present relations into ones in which the strong\r\nwield their power against the weak.\r\nIn countries whose sovereignty is being\r\nencroached upon, a large number of people are forced\r\nto live an insecure and miserable life, deprived of the\r\nfundamental right to survival, and the situation in\r\nneighbouring regions remains unstable. This indicates\r\nthat if a State’s sovereignty is infringed upon, no\r\ncountry can safeguard the dignity of its nation or\r\nachieve economic and social development;\r\nfurthermore, international peace and security will be\r\nendangered. There will be no justification whatsoever\r\nfor so-called “humanitarian intervention” that infringes\r\nupon sovereignty.\r\nLike big developed countries, the developing\r\ncountries also highly value their sovereignty. Respect\r\nfor a State’s sovereignty constitutes a cornerstone of\r\ninternational relations. In this regard, my delegation\r\npositively notes that the principles of respect for\r\nsovereign equality, non-interference in others’ internal\r\naffairs and political independence have been reaffirmed\r\nin the Millennium Declaration adopted at the\r\nMillennium Summit. We hold that these principles\r\nshould be observed in international relations of the new\r\ncentury and future activities of the United Nations.\r\nAnother important task facing the United Nations\r\nin the new century is to take practical measures to\r\nenable countries to benefit equally from globalization.\r\nThere has been a series of discussions on challenges to\r\nglobalization in the international arena — most\r\nrecently, during the Millennium Summit and the\r\ngeneral debate. However, we have not yet achieved a\r\ncommon understanding of the concept of globalization.\r\nAs a result, countries have divergent views and\r\narguments on globalization.\r\nIt can be said that several years have passed since\r\nthe globalization process seemed to start. Nevertheless,\r\nonly a few countries, particularly the developed\r\ncountries, are benefiting from it, while the overall\r\neconomic and social situation of the developing\r\ncountries is further deteriorating. The reality shows\r\nthat the globalization process, based on the\r\ninternational economic relations favourable only for\r\nthe developed countries, is aggravating poverty in the\r\ndeveloping countries and widening disparities between\r\nthe rich and the poor countries.\r\nThis is the conclusion we can draw from the\r\nglobalization process so far, as we enter the twenty-\r\nfirst century. In order to make globalization really\r\nbenefit all countries, new international economic\r\nrelations favourable for both the developed and the\r\ndeveloping countries should be established, through\r\npractical measures conducive to the economic\r\ndevelopment of the developing countries, such as\r\nreforming the loan policies of international financial\r\ninstitutions and introducing equitable international\r\ntrade regimes. Their realization requires political will\r\non the part of the developed countries.\r\nFor the United Nations to carry out those tasks,\r\nits functions and role should be decisively enhanced.\r\nWhat is important here is to enable the General\r\nAssembly, the major deliberative organ of the United\r\nNations, to play a central role in considering and\r\ndeciding on all matters that are brought to its attention.\r\nAs we are well aware, the General Assembly is the\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nmost representative, democratic and authoritative organ\r\nof the United Nations, and it has the mandates to\r\ndiscuss any issues, ranging from international peace\r\nand security to economic and social development and\r\nso forth. That notwithstanding, at present the General\r\nAssembly is not able to carry out its mandate under the\r\nCharter and continues to be marginalized in the\r\ndecision-making process. This means that, in the\r\nUnited Nations, crucial issues are being decided upon\r\nin other organs with limited membership. In order to\r\naddress that negative practice, the General Assembly’s\r\nrole should be enhanced to enable it to discuss\r\nimportant issues relating to international peace and\r\nsecurity. In particular, a system should be established\r\nwhich empowers the General Assembly to approve\r\nresolutions of the Security Council relating to the use\r\nof force or to the imposition of sanctions. Security\r\nCouncil resolutions are adopted on behalf of the entire\r\nUnited Nations membership. It is therefore natural that\r\nthe General Assembly, representing all countries,\r\nshould exercise such a power.\r\nIt is also equally important to ensure that United\r\nNations resolutions concerning economic and social\r\ndevelopment be fully implemented. Until now, we have\r\nnot seen the full implementation of various resolutions\r\ncalling for the democratization of the decision-making\r\nprocess of international financial institutions, the\r\nexpansion of development assistance and the\r\nalleviation of the debt burden with a view to actively\r\nassisting the efforts of developing countries towards\r\neconomic and social development. Consequently, the\r\nefforts of developing countries to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment have not produced the proper results, and\r\nthe expectations placed in the United Nations are\r\ndiminishing. In that regard, we take particular note of\r\nthe fact that the central role of the General Assembly as\r\nthe key deliberative and policy-making organ of the\r\nUnited Nations was reaffirmed in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, and we look forward to practical measures\r\nbeing taken to that end.\r\nMy delegation believes that those views should\r\nbe fully taken into account in future United Nations\r\nactivities, and we assure the Assembly that we will\r\nmake an active effort to ensure the success of the\r\npresent session.\r\nMr. Čalovski (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): As expected, the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization (A/55/1) is\r\ninformative and focused, and — which in our view is\r\nmore important — contains many comments,\r\nsuggestions and proposals. It gives us a good picture of\r\nthe work of the Organization and of its priorities for\r\nthe upcoming period. We have studied the report in\r\nparallel with the Secretary-General’s millennium report\r\n(A/54/2000), entitled “We the peoples: the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century”. The period\r\nthat both reports review was and continues to be the\r\nmost challenging of times for the Secretary-General\r\nand for the Organization. The main message of the\r\nreports is that, in spite of everything, the Organization\r\nremains indispensable, and that its organs have\r\nfunctioned satisfactorily.\r\nThe United Nations continues to influence global\r\ndevelopment and the global agenda. Its busiest bodies\r\nhave been the Security Council and the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR). Of course, the United Nations could have\r\ndone more. We hope that the positive outcome of the\r\nMillennium Summit and of the present Millennium\r\nAssembly will stimulate the Organization to do more in\r\nthe future in that direction — in accordance, of course,\r\nwith the Charter.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to make a\r\nfew comments on some of the issues dealt with in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. In the twenty-first century,\r\nthe United Nations must become a more relevant\r\norganization than it was in the second half of the\r\ntwentieth century. The principles of the Charter must\r\nbe observed and respected by all States. International\r\nlaw must be respected also. Globalization should be\r\nmanaged, and the best — the only — place to agree on\r\nits management is the United Nations. The basis for\r\nthat management should be the equality of nations and\r\nmutual respect among States, which can be achieved\r\nonly through cooperation and integration, not through\r\nconfrontation, the use of force or domination.\r\nWe have already left the period of confrontation\r\nbehind us. The Organization should remain truly\r\nuniversal and of equal importance for all nations, large\r\nand small. We should resist most strongly the\r\nmarginalization of the Organization, and we should\r\nuphold the position that only the United Nations can\r\npromote global integration for the benefit of all.\r\nRelations and cooperation among Member States, large\r\nand small, should be based on the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness. Everybody should benefit from this\r\ncooperation. The number-one goal of humanity is to\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\neliminate poverty and injustice. That would prevent the\r\neruption of world conflict.\r\nTo achieve all of that, and much more, we must\r\nhave a United Nations that is relevant for this century.\r\nThe Millennium Summit showed that this is possible.\r\nA careful study of the Secretary-General’s report\r\nmakes clear the same message. If that is correct, then\r\nthe principal organs of the Organization should be\r\nreformed, and the present hesitation in that respect\r\nshould be overcome. The Organization could be an\r\neffective engine of change and a leader in improved\r\ninternational relations and increased cooperation if it\r\ncontinues to reform itself, particularly its mechanisms\r\nand its principal organs: the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nFor some time, many delegations, including mine,\r\nhave been concerned with the need to strengthen the\r\nrole of the General Assembly, not at the expense of the\r\nother principal organs but on the basis of the provisions\r\nof the Charter. It is fair to say that the potential of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is not being fully utilized. In\r\nessence, the Assembly works for only one and a half\r\nmonths a year. Because of that, a routine prevails in its\r\nwork; if this continues, as is the case at present, the\r\nAssembly will further marginalize itself. Hence, in our\r\nview, a new arrangement for the work of the General\r\nAssembly is a necessity. The commitment undertaken\r\nby heads of State or Government at the Millennium\r\nSummit is of paramount importance in that respect and\r\nshould be implemented. The heads of State or\r\nGovernment resolved\r\n“To reaffirm the central position of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, and to enable it to play that role\r\neffectively”. (resolution 55/2, para. 30)\r\nTo realize that solemn commitment, we need a\r\nnew arrangement for the work of the General\r\nAssembly. The Assembly cannot discharge its duty as\r\nthe chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative organ under the present arrangement,\r\nwith its one-and-a-half-month working schedule.\r\nThe time has come for the General Assembly to\r\nstart functioning all year round, in the same way as\r\nnational parliaments are functioning. If that happens,\r\nmany sub-organs of the principal organs will become\r\nredundant. That will be of great importance for the\r\nparticipation in the work of the United Nations of the\r\nmajority of Member States, which cannot afford huge\r\nmissions in New York and cannot effectively\r\nparticipate in so many sub-organs and ad hoc working\r\nbodies.\r\nThe Secretary-General emphasizes in this year’s\r\nreport, as he did in last year’s report, the importance\r\nand the usefulness of prevention. We could not agree\r\nmore with him. The Republic of Macedonia has had a\r\nvery positive experience with prevention. It was the\r\nhost of the first United Nations preventive\r\npeacekeeping force, a very successful undertaking of\r\nthe United Nations. The Security Council did not\r\nestablish a similar preventive peacekeeping force in\r\nother regions, in spite of the obvious necessity. This\r\nissue must be thoroughly examined when we review\r\nthe Brahimi Panel report and when we consider the\r\nreport of the Security Council. It must be clear at the\r\nbeginning of this discussion that the establishment of\r\nUnited Nations preventive peacekeeping missions\r\nshould be the main preoccupation of the Security\r\nCouncil and be part of the new arrangement for\r\npeacekeeping forces. The reputation of our\r\nOrganization will be negatively affected if the Security\r\nCouncil continues to take action only after the eruption\r\nof war conflicts and continues to act like a fire brigade.\r\nIn the Secretary-General’s report (A/55/1)\r\nsubstantial space is devoted to our Organization’s\r\nhumanitarian action and rightfully so. It is possible that\r\nin the future we will be faced with the need for even\r\nlarger-scale humanitarian actions, owing to natural\r\ndisasters, war or civil conflicts. Some are concerned\r\nthat humanitarian efforts could be abused for political\r\naims, or that the principle of sovereignty could be\r\ndisregarded, or that humanitarian action could be\r\nundertaken that was contrary to the principles of the\r\nCharter. In our view, there is a need to clarify our\r\nOrganization’s position on this subject. We should not\r\nhave problems when there is a necessity to help people\r\nin need and we should not hesitate to take the\r\nnecessary humanitarian action. Respect for human\r\nrights and our obligation to help people in need should\r\nhave no boundaries.\r\nThe region of my country, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, is the Balkans or South-Eastern Europe,\r\nand it is mentioned in various chapters of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. It is true that it is a region\r\nburdened with many difficulties, owing mainly to the\r\nwars in parts of the former Yugoslavia, as well as to the\r\nsituation in Kosovo. But taking everything into\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\naccount, we can state that the general situation in the\r\nregion is improving. The main generator of that\r\nimprovement is the “Europeanization” of the region\r\nand efforts for the region to become integrated into the\r\nEuro-structure as fully and as soon as possible. Of\r\nparticular importance is the implementation of the\r\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe and, of course,\r\nthe success of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We are\r\noptimistic about the future of our region, but in order to\r\nreach a satisfactory situation, the involvement and the\r\nassistance of the international community is a\r\nnecessity.\r\nAt this point I would like to end my statement by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for providing us with\r\nsuch a useful and stimulating report, wishing him\r\nsuccesses in the upcoming period. The Republic of\r\nMacedonia will continue its excellent cooperation with\r\nthe Secretary-General and will not hesitate to give him\r\nits full support in his endeavours.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): Since I am speaking in the\r\nplenary for the first time, let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your well-\r\ndeserved election to steer the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. With your consummate diplomatic\r\nskills and leadership, you are sure to guide the General\r\nAssembly successfully.\r\nHuman beings have traversed many millennia in\r\ntheir journey. No doubt, the change of a century and a\r\nmillennium is significant; but we are cognizant that it\r\nis incidental to the calendars — which are many — that\r\nour societies observe. Yet, we must seize every\r\nopportunity that comes our way likely to be of service\r\nto our common humanity. Nepal is happy that the\r\nUnited Nations did so by organizing the Millennium\r\nSummit, which has, presumably, opened a new chapter\r\nin the history of both human beings and the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt was a cause for exuberance that 147 heads of\r\nState and Government met at the Summit and mulled\r\nover ways for a better world for everyone. We now\r\nhave the challenge to translate the vision of the Summit\r\nDeclaration into concrete programmes and strategies to\r\nmeet the goals the Summit has set for us. We are\r\nsoberly reminded that, in the past, the pledges we all\r\nhave made have remained unfulfilled. If we were to be\r\nserious this time, and Nepal hopes we all are, this\r\nAssembly is the point whence the process of\r\nimplementing that vision in all earnestness must start.\r\nMr. Pradhan (Bhutan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAs world leaders agreed at the Summit, we need a\r\nstronger and better-equipped United Nations playing a\r\npivotal role in global affairs as the most representative\r\nand universal body to achieve shared goals in an\r\nincreasingly multi-polar world; for we all — large and\r\nsmall, rich and poor — need the United Nations. We\r\nalso try to contribute to improving the work of the\r\nOrganization in our own ways and within our\r\ncapacities. We feel pain when the Organization fails\r\nand rejoice when it succeeds. It is for that reason that\r\nthe appreciation of the Organization’s performance\r\nmust be viewed in this perspective.\r\nLet me now pay heartfelt tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Annan for trying through his untiring efforts to\r\npromote peace, stimulate development, foster the rule\r\nof law and strengthen the Organization. Under his\r\nleadership, the United Nations has become a forward-\r\nlooking organization willing to take proactive steps and\r\nto reach out as necessary. The Secretary-General’s\r\nannual report, entitled “Common Destiny, New\r\nResolve”, presents eloquently both what the\r\nOrganization has been able to accomplish in the course\r\nof the past year and what still needs to be done to\r\nimprove our common destiny through new resolve. In\r\ntaking stock of the period under review, we find that\r\nthe United Nations has had a mixed bag of successes\r\nand failures. Just as we celebrate its successes, we must\r\nalso reflect on its failures.\r\nThe Organization’s involvement in East Timor\r\nhas meant the dawning of new hope for people there.\r\nPeople in Kosovo are building new lives and picking\r\nup the pieces of their shattered past. Many other\r\ntrouble-stricken places also see the beacon that the\r\nOrganization’s engagement brings them. Today, 45,000\r\nblue helmets and 13,000 civilian staff are busy keeping\r\nthe peace and bringing succour to people’s lives, more\r\nthan at any other time in the post-cold-war era.\r\nHowever, much remains to be done to meet the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe world has not become more peaceful, nor has\r\nit made progress in spreading to everyone around the\r\nworld the benefits of globalization and the information\r\nrevolution. Countries in Africa, Asia, Latin American\r\nand Europe are embroiled in unfortunate conflicts that\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nare now more internal in nature than inter-State in\r\ncharacter. The arms race is moving at full-steam in\r\nmany regions, thereby sapping States of the strength\r\nand resources that could otherwise be used to make a\r\ndifference in their peoples’ lives.\r\nGlobalization has unleashed opportunities for\r\ngrowth for some, and has brought burdens to others;\r\nmore riches for some and more war for others.\r\nGlobalization has not only created markets for the\r\ngoods, services, capital and technology of rich\r\ncountries, but it has also brought to the world crime,\r\npollution, drugs, disease and refugees. Surely, great\r\nchallenges to peace, prosperity and justice lie ahead for\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nSadly for all of us, the Organization has not been\r\nable to live up to the mandate conferred upon it by the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, let alone up to the expectations\r\nof peoples. The reasons for that are two-fold: the\r\nmembership has failed the United Nations, and the\r\nleadership has failed the peoples. We must work\r\ncollectively to change that.\r\nThe Brahimi report is telling evidence that both\r\nthe Security Council and the Secretariat failed the\r\npeople of Rwanda and Srebrenica. The United Nations\r\npulled out of those places just as simmering ethnic\r\ndisputes were quickly sliding into disastrous conflicts\r\nthat caused colossal loss of life, and at a time when\r\npeople in those places needed a stronger United\r\nNations presence. If the Security Council turned a\r\nblind eye to impending disaster, the Secretariat was\r\nunable to convince the Council to do what was needed\r\nto avert it.\r\nThough it is making efforts, the world body has\r\nalso not been able to make much of a dent in the\r\nproblem of eliminating poverty and backwardness. We\r\nmust not shift blame among each other. Rather, we\r\nshould make a collective resolve to build a better\r\ncommon future.\r\nOn questions of peace and security, we appreciate\r\nthe innovative efforts of the Secretary-General to bring\r\non-board regional organizations in realizing common\r\npurposes. However, we must make sure that there is no\r\nconflict of interest and that the United Nations provides\r\nleadership and does not remain a mere spectator when\r\nactions are taken on its behalf. Neither should it let a\r\npattern develop whereby it steps in when unilateral\r\naction is over. Preventive steps based on analytical\r\ninformation collected from different sources and\r\nindependently verified would bring greater value for\r\nthe United Nations money. The Brahimi report\r\nprovides many useful recommendations, and needs to\r\nbe examined thoroughly in order to make the best use\r\nof it.\r\nSanctions have adversely affected innocent\r\npeople and innocent third countries. The United\r\nNations must find a way to mitigate such effects and\r\ncompensate innocent third countries.\r\nThere is no doubt that the withdrawal of gratis\r\npersonnel has stripped the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations of much-needed human resources. But that\r\nmust not be used as an excuse for every failure of\r\nUnited Nations operations. We must find the way to\r\nremedy the situation in a manner acceptable to all and\r\nequitable to all.\r\nWe recall that an overwhelming number of\r\nstatements at the Millennium Summit underlined the\r\nfact that poverty is the root cause of conflict. Hence,\r\nworld leaders have also committed to a number of\r\ndevelopmental goals. The United Nations must not let\r\nthis renewed momentum fizzle out. It must take serious\r\nmeasures to facilitate delivery on the pledge the leaders\r\nhave made to spark sustained growth, reduce poverty,\r\npreserve the environment and to tackle problems such\r\nas gender imbalances, illiteracy and disease, including\r\nthe AIDS epidemic. We must ensure that the creative\r\nenergies of peoples and the socially responsible private\r\nsector are unleashed by promoting market-friendly and\r\ninnovative development. The United Nations must lead\r\nin coordinating activities with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization and other\r\ninternational and regional bodies to foster synergy for\r\nspeedy development.\r\nNepal applauds Secretary-General Annan for\r\nbringing Africa to the world’s attention. Africa indeed\r\nneeds attention commensurate with its problems, but so\r\ndo other needy countries — in particular less\r\ndeveloped and land-locked countries. What has struck\r\nmy delegation the most about the report is the fact that\r\nthere is no mention of certain major recent and future\r\nevents. Such events include the South Summit and the\r\n2001 United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, in which Africa and other\r\nregions facing similar problems have huge stakes. I\r\nhope I have not overlooked such references.\r\nDevelopment is an area in which the Organization\r\ncan do much as a facilitator and catalyst. However, it\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nhas been largely unable to deliver on that. It appears\r\nthat the Organization is still losing more of its capacity,\r\nas the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment and other bodies and units of the\r\nOrganization fear being curtailed or even eliminated.\r\nWe must come up with more imaginative solutions to\r\nour development funding problems at the high-level\r\nevent next year, as well as at conferences of least\r\ndeveloped and land-locked countries. In addition, we\r\nmust work together to put the Organization back on a\r\nsteady course as a catalyst for development and\r\nprogress.\r\nThe protection of children and other vulnerable\r\ngroups in conflicts and disasters, as well as the plight\r\nof refugees, are common concerns for us all. Nepal\r\nappreciates the efforts of the United Nations in these\r\nareas, in particular its efforts to help resolve refugee\r\nproblems in many parts of the world, including the\r\nproblem of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal. An integrated\r\napproach to peacekeeping and human rights might help\r\nbring about synergy in the efforts of the Organization\r\nin this area.\r\nHumanitarian intervention has become a major\r\nissue of late, and the Secretary-General’s report\r\nexpresses concern as to how another Rwanda can be\r\naverted. There is no doubt that we must not tolerate\r\nmassacres in the name of sovereignty, nor should\r\nanyone be allowed to trample upon the sovereignty of\r\nany State in any other way than that provided for in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe answer lies neither in intervention nor in\r\nletting massacres happen, but in efforts to prevent\r\n“gross and systematic violations” of human rights by\r\naddressing disputes before they turn into disasters,\r\nthrough political understanding and diplomacy. If we\r\nwere to agree on intervention, the obvious question\r\nrises: for how long do we intervene? Intervention does\r\nnot remove deep-seated hatred and animosity. Rather,\r\nwe must tear down the walls of hatred, build bridges,\r\nand enhance social harmony through participatory\r\ngovernance, economic development, and distributive\r\njustice.\r\nThe United Nations has done much to improve its\r\nefficiency and pare down its costs. We support the\r\nSecretary-General in these efforts. But there is more\r\nthat can be done to cut corners, to remove waste and to\r\nspruce up its performance. However, staff retrenchment\r\nalone — though essential where redundancy exists —\r\nwill not suffice. We must overhaul the system. We must\r\nstop politically motivated recruitment and promotion\r\nlinked with it. We must make the system more result-\r\noriented, merit-based, yet representative and effective.\r\nWe must streamline its headquarters and field offices,\r\nreform its financial rules and regulations; and equip it\r\nwith the latest management techniques and\r\ntechnologies. These measures are essential if the\r\nUnited Nations is to be a force attuned to meet the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nNepal appreciates the Secretary-General’s efforts\r\nto reach out to the private sector and civil society. We\r\nwould, however, like to echo the wise counsel of the\r\nformer leader of one of our friendly countries: trust but\r\nverify. At the same time, we would also encourage the\r\nSecretariat to dedicate more of its time and resources to\r\nthe core responsibilities for which it exists, rather than\r\nto peripheral activities that are helpful but not\r\nnecessarily critical.\r\nTo conclude, my delegation commends and\r\nsupports the Secretary-General for the good work he\r\nhas been doing and for the leadership he has been\r\nproviding. We also urge him to be more mindful of the\r\nneeds and sensitivities of small and poor countries.\r\nEvery country must feel connected and included; every\r\nconcern of regional and global significance must find\r\nits proper place in the global agenda with which the\r\nUnited Nations is entrusted. Nepal is willing to do its\r\npart to move beyond mere supportive sentiments.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nrecently concluded Millennium Summit places the\r\ndebate on the Secretary-General’s report on the work of\r\nthe Organization at a very different level from that of\r\nprevious years. We must recognize that more than 150\r\nheads of State made statements on the main priorities\r\nto be dealt with by the international community in\r\ncoming years.\r\nAgainst this background, the Secretary-General\r\nhas submitted an important report on the work of the\r\nOrganization since the last General Assembly. In our\r\nopinion, the current report should be read within the\r\ngeneral context established by the Millennium Report,\r\n“We the peoples”, which reiterates many of the\r\nthoughts and questions that have given Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nthe very extraordinary moral and political stature he\r\nenjoys today in the international community. The\r\nreport offers us an opportunity to move forward in our\r\nthinking on the main themes being debated at this\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nGeneral Assembly, thereby building the necessary\r\nconvergence so that the United nations can carry out\r\nthe mandates given to it by the heads of State.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to share\r\nsome thoughts abut three global aspects of the report\r\nthat have special relevance for my country. The first\r\naspect relates to global governance, and the questions\r\nof peacekeeping in particular, and the response to\r\nhumanitarian disasters. As the Secretary-General so\r\nrightly has indicated, this is in the context of the\r\ninternational community’s preferential concern for the\r\nrights of the individual.\r\nWe already know the huge risks for international\r\npeace — as well as for the prestige and credibility of\r\nthis Organization — that have resulted from the\r\nhumanitarian and political failures of recent years. We\r\nalso know that these issues cover a variety of\r\noperations that are increasingly specialized and\r\ncomplicated, as well as increasingly interconnected\r\namong themselves. They involve the military,\r\nhumanitarian, social and political spheres. What runs\r\nthrough them all, nonetheless, is a question that the\r\nSecretary-General raised in the Millennium Report, and\r\nthis can be summed up as “the intervention dilemma”.\r\nAs indicated in the report, it is relatively easy to\r\ncondemn humanitarian disasters, massacres, massive\r\nviolations of human rights and the racist ideology that\r\nunderlies the systems of apartheid or the persecution of\r\nminorities. But we still do not know how to act when\r\nthese events occur. This is why my country, aware of\r\nthe difficulties resulting from the sensitive nature of\r\nthis topic, welcomes with interest the invitation from\r\nCanada to join an independent commission on\r\nintervention and State sovereignty. This commission\r\nwould explore the circumstances and the bases upon\r\nwhich the international community ought to intervene\r\nto help resolve intolerable humanitarian situations\r\ndespite claims of national sovereignty.\r\nIt is clear that the problem is based on our ability\r\nto give the Organization greater legitimacy in its work.\r\nThis implies, first of all, the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, since it is mainly on the basis of the Council’s\r\ndecisions — expanded, participatory and transparent\r\nones — that the international community can face the\r\nvery difficult decisions required by the questions of\r\ngovernance in today’s world.\r\nAnother fundamental aspect of global\r\ngovernance, separate from the aforementioned — and\r\nthis should be discussed in and of itself — relates to\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. The\r\nSecretary-General was quite right in requesting an\r\nindependent panel of experts to submit a report on\r\npeacekeeping operations. Chile attaches particular\r\nimportance to the Brahimi report and is studying its\r\nproposals carefully. Among these proposals, we find\r\nrecommendations that could be adopted quickly,\r\nwhereas others require a more cautious approach in\r\norder to build broad consensus. We understand, in any\r\ncase, that the report requires political will and\r\ncompliance, with the financial commitments of all, and\r\nparticularly those who have assumed a decisive role in\r\ninternational affairs, towards this Organization.\r\nAnother aspect of governance relates to the\r\npromotion of development. It is obvious that the\r\nexpectations of four decades of development have not\r\nbeen met and, accordingly, there is disappointment,\r\nwhich is starting to turn into alarm, not only in the\r\npoorest countries but also in many countries that\r\nbelieved that they had found the path to progress. The\r\nmeetings of the financial institutions that are identified\r\nwith the current international order are facing protests\r\nfrom sectors of civil society, and there are fears of\r\ngrowing reaction against globalization.\r\nIn fact, more and more people are rightly\r\nquestioning the value of a civilization that sets the\r\nendless accumulation of profit as its primary goal at the\r\nexpense of satisfying social needs. No one today is\r\nunaware of the fact that globalization creates enormous\r\nopportunities for those who can participate in it, but\r\nthat it also further widens the gulf of inequality for\r\nthose who are left out of this contemporary\r\nphenomenon.\r\nWe cannot fail to note that the protests have been\r\ndirected not against the United Nations, but against\r\nspecialized economic organizations. That may be\r\nbecause it is felt that the values and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations are to ensure that, along with growth,\r\nequity is preserved in the distribution of wealth at the\r\nnational and global levels. It is also possible, however,\r\nthat this is only a partial explanation and that there is\r\nanother that is less comforting. Perhaps the protests\r\nhave not reached the United Nations because, although\r\nwe repeat year after year that development is at the\r\ncentre of the Organization’s work, our action is\r\nperipheral with respect to the major issues determining\r\nthe nature of the international economic order.\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nWe must not, of course, overlook the\r\nOrganization’s economic work, in particular the\r\nactivities of the specialized agencies of the system,\r\nwhich do commendable work on multilateral assistance\r\nfor development. We wonder, however, whether it is\r\nalso effectively implementing its mandate and\r\nassuming its responsibility to promote development.\r\nWe must recognize that, with a few exceptions, our\r\ninfluence on the world economic environment has been\r\nminor. This is simply because Member States have\r\npreferred to leave that task to other institutions.\r\nThe current situation demonstrates, however, that\r\nthe promotion of development with equity cannot be\r\nrelegated to mere technical discussion. The promotion\r\nof an international economic environment that is\r\nsensitive to the requirements of development — in\r\nparticular, that of the developing countries and the\r\nmost vulnerable individuals — is a political decision\r\nthat requires broad consensus on the part of the\r\ninternational community. The only organization with\r\nthe necessary political legitimacy to carry out this role\r\nis the United Nations.\r\nThe fundamental issue today is to decide, on the\r\nbasis of our Charter mandate, how the United Nations\r\ncan play a role in the great economic decisions that\r\ndetermine the international economic environment.\r\nThis will require reform of the international financial\r\nand monetary system and the determination of the pace\r\nand selection of the sectors to be involved in the\r\nliberalization of international trade. As to the volume\r\nand characteristics of official development assistance\r\nand external debt relief and the implementation of this\r\ncommitment jointly with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization, we feel\r\nthat a United Nations that is given a hearing in the\r\nconsideration of important international economic\r\naffairs would be very useful in attaining the objectives\r\nof people-centred sustainable development, which is\r\nthe common objective of all international economic\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIts primary work in this area would be identifying\r\nworld economic problems and heightening awareness\r\nof the need to address them, taking into account the\r\nrequirements of development. In this context, we\r\nappreciate the Secretary-General’s commitment to the\r\nsuccess of the high-level international event on\r\nfinancing for development, which has been\r\nstrengthened by the mandate that our heads of State\r\ngave him in the Millennium Declaration. The event,\r\nwhich we believe should be convened as a global\r\nconference, will be worthwhile if it responds to a\r\nresolute will to revitalize the role of the United Nations\r\nin promoting an international economic order that is\r\nsensitive to the values of justice and equity on which\r\nthe Organization is based. It should also be capable of\r\npromoting concertation with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, WTO and other appropriate agencies and\r\nof moving forward in a spirit of renewed association\r\nfor development among developed and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe question of sustainable development, in\r\nparticular the Rio +10 conference to be held in two\r\nyears, is another issue that is related to the foregoing in\r\nseveral ways and is of particular concern to Chile. We\r\nshare the Secretary-General’s concern regarding the\r\nloss of visibility and political importance of the topic\r\nof sustainable development. The conference will offer\r\nan excellent opportunity to revitalize the subject, which\r\nis so important to future generations.\r\nThe recent information received on the shrinking\r\nof the ozone layer has direct bearing on Chile, since it\r\nis occurring in the Antarctic region. The expansion of\r\ndead zones in the oceans and the melting of the polar\r\nicecap are of great concern and require our immediate\r\nconsideration.\r\nThe United Nations work in the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights is of vital importance to my\r\ndelegation. As a country that has occasionally\r\nbenefited from the Organization’s work in this field,\r\nChile agrees with the Secretary-General on the need to\r\ncontinue strengthening and reinforcing that work, in\r\nparticular through the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, both in the area of\r\ncivil and political rights and in the sphere of economic,\r\nsocial and cultural rights.\r\nFor Chile, the universality of human rights means\r\nthe intrinsic dignity of all inhabitants of the planet as a\r\nwhole. Neither the lack of development nor the special\r\nfeatures of specific cultures can be invoked to justify\r\nany limitation on human rights recognized in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nWith regard to the advancement of women,\r\nintense and arduous work has been done to achieve\r\nrecognition of their rights as inherent human rights. In\r\nthis connection, what is both revealing and\r\ndiscouraging is the fact that, after the follow-up\r\nexercise of the Fourth World Conference on Women,\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nmost commitments remain to be fulfilled. The report of\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund entitled The State\r\nof World Population 2000 offers discouraging\r\ncommentary in this connection. It confirms that,\r\nunfortunately, there are still situations in which women\r\nare at a disadvantage and their most fundamental rights\r\nare violated. We should make the struggle to overcome\r\nthis hurdle the basis of our work to comply with the\r\ncommitment in the twenty-first century to integrate\r\nmore than half of humankind into the full exercise and\r\nenjoyment of the human rights recognized in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nAs a result of the Millennium Summit, there\r\nwould appear to exist a new atmosphere of solidarity\r\nand a common attitude towards the great challenges we\r\nface on the changing international scene. However, one\r\nmajor task remains ahead. It will be necessary to\r\ndetermine whether we have not only the will, but\r\nalso — and even more difficult — the political capacity\r\nto ensure that the United Nations can supply the great\r\nresponses expected and required of us by our peoples,\r\nthe common citizens from whom we have received our\r\nmandate.\r\nMr. Vento (Italy): The Secretary-General’s report\r\nthis year shapes a sweeping picture of the United\r\nNations wide-ranging activities. At the close of the\r\nsecond millennium, the sheer volume of the United\r\nNations activity provides tangible proof of the\r\nOrganization’s role as the universal guarantor of the\r\nhighest aspirations in the areas of international peace\r\nand security, development and human rights.\r\nItaly’s deep belief in the United Nations ongoing\r\nvitality is reflected in the commitment and support we\r\nhave constantly provided and intend to increase in the\r\nfuture. We do so not only as the fifth top contributor to\r\nthe regular budget and the sixth top contributor to the\r\npeacekeeping budget, but also through national\r\ninitiatives in the areas of debt relief, post-conflict\r\nreconstruction, response to natural catastrophes and our\r\nsupport for the United Nations food and agricultural\r\ninstitutions in Rome and other United Nations bodies\r\nheadquartered in Italy.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s summary of the past\r\nyear’s activities makes extensive reference to the\r\nMillennium Summit and to the related follow-up\r\naction. Italy welcomes the strong appeals made for a\r\ndemocratic reform of the Security Council aimed at\r\nmaking it more representative and effective. We are\r\nencouraged by the fact that only a very small minority\r\nof Member States expressed support for an increase in\r\nnew national permanent seats.\r\nSecondly, we all have to consider the\r\nrecommendations of the Panel of experts chaired by the\r\nformer Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria,\r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi. The group sought concrete\r\nanswers to the many questions raised by peacekeeping\r\noperations in recent months. Its report makes a\r\ntechnical rather than a political contribution and should\r\ntherefore be submitted to the United Nations policy-\r\nmaking bodies, starting with the General Assembly, for\r\nan assessment of its political implications and practical\r\nfeasibility.\r\nMany of the proposals point to serious problems\r\nwith the mandates, format and working procedures of\r\npeacekeeping operations. An in-depth study of these\r\nproposals is an urgent matter. The experience of a\r\ngrowing number of peacekeeping operations points to a\r\ncritical need for a broader, more integrated vision of\r\nthe three distinct stages of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, that is to say, conflict\r\nprevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding. If lasting peace is to be achieved, these three\r\nstages are inseparable.\r\nThe tripling of the peacekeeping budget in the\r\npast year alone has entailed larger contributions from\r\nMember States. My country, for example, is being\r\nasked to increase its allotment of the previous year,\r\nwith a contribution to the peacekeeping budget for the\r\ncurrent year which will approach an estimated $110\r\nmillion. As a matter of definition of our priorities, we\r\nwould prefer to devote greater political capital, as well\r\nas greater material resources, to conflict prevention and\r\nto supporting countries with unstable social, civil and\r\neconomic structures.\r\nAnother lesson to be learned from episodes in the\r\nrecent past is the need for a better use and rationalizing\r\nof the structures we already have at our disposal. The\r\nUnited Nations Staff College in Turin plays a useful\r\nrole, working closely with the Secretariat to hold\r\ntraining courses for hundreds of officials from United\r\nNations departments, agencies and programmes. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report postulates the expansion of\r\nits activities, while the debate that the General\r\nAssembly is about to initiate on improving United\r\nNations peacekeeping structures will provide clearer\r\nguidance in this respect. Italy is ready to do its part and\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\ncontribute to the strengthening of the United Nations\r\nStaff College in Turin.\r\nEmergency situations in the Balkans and Africa\r\nin particular have highlighted the fundamental support\r\nprovided by the Brindisi Logistics Base, located at the\r\ncrossroads of the Mediterranean, between the Balkans,\r\nthe Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. The Brindisi\r\nBase is playing an even greater role than originally\r\nexpected. The most pressing short-term need of the\r\nBase is to replenish the stockpile of required materials.\r\nBoth the Brahimi report and the Secretary-General\r\nmake specific proposals in this regard that should not\r\ngo unheeded.\r\nA streamlined, more effective management of\r\npeace operations will demand a greater and more\r\nqualified commitment on all the subjects involved. As\r\na follow-up to the report we expect from the\r\nSecretariat, the competent statutory organs will have to\r\nadopt the necessary measures, acting from a new\r\nperspective and with a renewed sense of determination.\r\nWe need both the authorities of the General Assembly\r\nand the involvement of the Security Council.\r\nAction by the United Nations alone will not be\r\nenough. A new sense of responsibility is required on\r\nthe part of each and every Member State, in\r\ncooperation with regional organizations. It is only\r\nnatural that the primary responsibility of the Security\r\nCouncil should extend beyond the moment of decision\r\non individual, single peacekeeping missions and\r\ninclude direct support for the same. Stronger ties are\r\nneeded between the policy and decision-making\r\nprocess, entrusted primarily to the Security Council\r\nmembers, and human and financial resources support\r\nfor single missions, often provided by non-members of\r\nthe Security Council. Moreover, troop-contributing\r\ncountries should be given a greater say in the\r\noperations where they are fielding their own personnel.\r\nThus the Brahimi report’s recommendations in this\r\nregard deserve, in our view, a prominent place in our\r\nfuture discussions.\r\nPeace and development are inextricably linked.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report once again spells out\r\nhis message clearly. In accordance with Articles 10 and\r\n11 of the Charter, the General Assembly is the supreme\r\ngoverning body for all matters under United Nations\r\ncompetence, to which, in fact, the Security Council\r\nprovides accounts of its activities, pursuant to Article\r\n15. At the same time, the General Assembly must be\r\nplaced in a position allowing it to address with vision\r\nand effectiveness its political, legal, social and\r\neconomic responsibilities. In the latter sector it is\r\nassisted by the United Nations body entrusted by the\r\nCharter with the handling of economic and social\r\naffairs, the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe General Assembly can carry out these\r\nfunctions either directly or by stimulating the\r\ncommitment of other international players. In the past\r\ntwo years, laudable efforts have been made to promote\r\nsynergy with the main non-governmental partners,\r\nstarting with the heads of national parliaments and\r\nbusiness leaders, who must become increasingly aware\r\nof their social responsibilities in the area of solidarity.\r\nIn this instance, this year’s report could have\r\ndwelt at greater length on the renewed authority and\r\ninitiative of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nparticularly in the coordination of its work with that of\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions. The economic, health\r\nand security difficulties that still plague various regions\r\nof the world can be addressed with better prospects for\r\nsuccess if existing United Nations instruments are fully\r\nutilized.\r\nOf course, efforts to foster development must be\r\ncomplemented by Member States’ commitment and\r\ntheir prompt, targeted development assistance\r\ninitiatives. In view of our deeply felt perception that\r\nservicing their foreign debt represents an unjust burden\r\nfor many countries, Italy has decided to cancel over $6\r\nbillion in trade and assistance credits over three\r\nbudgetary years. That is why we are glad to learn that\r\nin the current meetings in Prague the international\r\nfinancial institutions are increasingly moving along\r\nthese same lines highlighted by the Italian initiatives.\r\nAt the turn of the century, we are living an\r\nextraordinary moment in international relations\r\ncharacterized by extraordinary changes and\r\nextraordinary problems, but also by extraordinary\r\npossibilities that can be realized only through strong\r\npolitical will.\r\nConfronted with the contrast between the new\r\nchallenges of globalization and age-old threats, the\r\nworld today is demanding greater justice for all, a\r\njustice that translates not only into growing efficiency\r\nand transparency in United Nations bodies and\r\nprocedures, but also into institutional reforms that give\r\nvisible testimony to the commitment of Member States\r\nto common and deeply shared objectives and values.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court in 1998 and the preparatory work for its\r\nestablishment are the most significant recent\r\ndevelopments in this direction.\r\nIt is Italy’s hope that the Secretary-General’s\r\nappeal for prompt ratification of the Statute and the\r\nurgent entry into force of the Court will receive a\r\npositive and attentive response from all Member States.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): My delegation would like to express its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization for this year. This report\r\nclarifies once again the efforts made by the United\r\nNations to face international challenges in different\r\nfields, and details the Organization’s contributions to\r\nbringing about peace. Furthermore, it includes a\r\ncomprehensive review of peacekeeping operations and\r\nprovides recommendations aimed at helping the\r\nOrganization to undertake such activities in a better\r\nmanner in the future.\r\nThis discussion every year provides us with an\r\noccasion to make our remarks and state our positions\r\nregarding the content of the annual report on the work\r\nof the Organization. In this framework, we share the\r\nSecretary-General’s concerns expressed at the\r\nbeginning of the report regarding the eruption of new\r\nconflicts in many parts of the world during the past\r\nyear and the continuation of many other longstanding\r\nconflicts that continue to defy the many intensive\r\nefforts by the Secretary-General and other mediators to\r\nfind solutions. In addition, we are pleased by the\r\nobservation in another part of the report that the\r\nrealization of peace remains the United Nations first\r\nand foremost objective. This is clearly shown by the\r\nextensive coverage of the efforts made to resolve\r\ndisputes, particularly in Africa.\r\nIn this context, my delegation commends the\r\nUnited Nations for the assistance it has provided to\r\nAfrican endeavours. We believe that Africa needs more\r\nsupport in order to put an end to the remaining\r\nconflicts and to prevent the emergence of future crises\r\nthat might scuttle current achievements. We believe\r\nthat the real problems of Africa can be dealt with only\r\nthrough a comprehensive approach that takes into\r\naccount African priorities. Supporting the initiatives of\r\nAfrican leaders and adopting the conclusions of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) are needed to put\r\nan end to old conflicts and to mobilize international\r\nefforts to bring about peace.\r\nAfrica fully recognizes that it has to face its own\r\nchallenges and undertake its own development. But\r\ninternational cooperation in this area is still a major\r\nelement. Africa cannot achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment or succeed in eradicating poverty —\r\nwhich the Secretary-General repeatedly describes as\r\nthe most important challenge facing the African\r\ncontinent — unless we deal with Africa’s foreign debt\r\nburden, which amounts to more than $350 billion.\r\nAfrica needs an international programme to eradicate\r\nmalaria and HIV/AIDS, which is currently devastating\r\n24 African countries. My delegation, which appreciates\r\nthe will expressed by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment at the Millennium Summit, hopes that\r\nserious programmes to combat HIV/AIDS will be\r\nimplemented. We hope that as part of this overall\r\neffort, the initiative to provide drugs at affordable\r\nprices will also be implemented.\r\nWe appreciate the Secretary-General’s effort to\r\nput the needs of Africa on the list of priorities of the\r\nUnited Nations development cluster. We call on the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies to\r\nundertake studies on how to promote local\r\nmanufacturing that makes use of African raw materials\r\nand to set up programmes to develop the airports and\r\nseaports of the continent. Despite the pledges that the\r\ninternational community has made to help Africa, we\r\nmust say that Africa needs more concrete actions than\r\nmere pledges and eloquent speeches.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report shows the\r\nnegative impact of sanctions on civilians and on\r\nneighbouring States. For us, embargoes are not just a\r\nsource of concern, but also a method to be rejected,\r\nsince embargoes and sanctions are imposed as a means\r\nfor exacting revenge. This is the case with the embargo\r\nagainst my country, for instance, where because of\r\nsuspicion against two individuals — suspicion for\r\nwhich there was no evidence — unjust sanctions were\r\nimposed on all segments of the Libyan people. The\r\nfinancial losses due to these embargoes run in the\r\nmillions of dollars. What is worse is that the United\r\nStates of America used the period since the collapse of\r\nthe international balance of power to call on the\r\nSecurity Council to impose sanctions on Libya.\r\nMoreover, the United States of America is now\r\npreventing the Security Council from adopting a draft\r\nresolution to completely lift these sanctions.\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nI would like to point out that the United States of\r\nAmerica is calling for payment of compensation for the\r\nvictims of Pan Am Flight 103 before the court has\r\nreached a judgement concerning this matter. This\r\ntrashes the legal principle that the defendant is\r\ninnocent until proven guilty. It also ignores the call of\r\nmost members of the international community to lift\r\nthe sanctions against Libya after it had fully complied\r\nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council\r\nregarding the Lockerbie accident. In addition, it\r\nignores the Secretary-General’s report of June of last\r\nyear, in which he emphasized that my country has\r\ncomplied fully with all the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil concerning this incident.\r\nWe agree that the Secretary-General’s vision of\r\ndisarmament is one of the most important elements of\r\nthe United Nations strategy for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. On this basis, my\r\ncountry is now a party to most of the international\r\nconventions in this field, including the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nBut we must say here that a number of\r\ninternational conventions in this field still need to be\r\nreviewed and made more acceptable. The\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), for\r\nexample, does not fulfil the aspirations of the people of\r\nthe world to the eradication of all nuclear weapons\r\nthroughout the world. The CTBT does not establish a\r\ntime-frame for the abolition of nuclear weapons\r\narsenals, which are the monopoly of just a few\r\ncountries. In fact the CTBT affirms the status quo and\r\ndashes the aspirations of the people to free the world\r\nfrom the horror of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe fact that we share the concerns of the entire\r\ninternational community regarding disarmament does\r\nnot mean that we ignore the issue of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines that are only defensive in nature. We believe\r\nthat the people of the world should concentrate on the\r\ndestruction of chemical and biological weapons and\r\nballistic missiles, not just on landmines, which are the\r\nsimplest form of weapons.\r\nWe note the optimism expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report regarding pledges by nuclear-\r\nweapon States to fully do away with their nuclear\r\narsenals. What is required are effective measures in\r\nthis field. Talking about destroying nuclear weapons\r\nwithout actually doing that is merely an attempt to\r\ndeceive the peoples of the world.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General reviews the\r\nagreements reached concerning the implementation of\r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court. My\r\ncountry — which has shown its support for the\r\nenforcement of international law by acceding to all the\r\ninternational conventions that aim at combating\r\ncrime — believes that there is a need to take additional\r\nmeasures to establish international regimes to deal with\r\nthose who commit serious crimes. The present Statute\r\nof the International Criminal Court is designed to judge\r\nthe weak only. We call for its amendment so as to\r\nguarantee that all perpetrators of acts of aggression and\r\nall drug smugglers and other criminals are brought to\r\njustice. The United Nations has attached special\r\nimportance to international law, and the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/55/1) clearly shows the activities\r\nof the Organization in this field. My delegation would\r\nlike to express its satisfaction regarding United Nations\r\nactivities in this field.\r\nEven though the international community has\r\nrepeatedly called for the respect of international law,\r\nthis has not been fully accepted and implemented. We\r\nbelieve that a specific country continues to stipulate\r\ncoercive laws and to apply such laws to companies,\r\ncountries and individuals of other countries. The\r\nHelms-Burton Act and the D’Amato-Kennedy Act are\r\nexamples of this. Now, as we enter a new millennium\r\nin which international norms should be strengthened,\r\nwe believe that it is important that the international\r\ncommunity should exert pressure to abolish such laws\r\nsince they undermine the noble principles consecrated\r\nin the United Nations Charter.\r\nFinally, we would like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reforms in human resources in this\r\nOrganization. We hope these efforts will continue to\r\ncreate an equitable geographical distribution of jobs\r\nand to reflect complete clarity and transparency when\r\nsuch jobs are announced.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Speaking for the first time during the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations, I would like immediately to express to the\r\nPresident my congratulations on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, which this year is\r\nknown as the Millennium Assembly.\r\nThe moment is unique and symbolic, and we are\r\nall familiar with the force of symbols, which, in the\r\ncourse of history, has enabled mankind to lay the bases\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nfor a better future. We are here today precisely in order\r\nto lay the foundations for common action and for\r\ncollective action in the spirit of a contract of solidarity\r\nand in order to build together the twenty-first century.\r\nWe are happy to see that the presidency of this\r\nsession, which represents a decisive phase in the future\r\nof humanity, has been entrusted to such certain,\r\ninformed and expert hands as those of our President.\r\nI would also like to express to his predecessor our\r\ngreat appreciation for the high-quality work he carried\r\nout throughout the fifty-fourth session. In particular we\r\nare thinking of the methodical preparation for the\r\nMillennium Summit, which greatly facilitated the\r\ncourse and the results produced.\r\nLet us not beat around the bush: he followed the\r\nroyal path of excellence laid out by his illustrious\r\nAfrican predecessors:, Alex Quaison-Sackey, Mongi\r\nSlim, Angie Brooks, Bouteflika and others.\r\nWe also wish to express to the Secretary-General\r\nhow much we welcome his excellent reports submitted\r\nto the current Millennium Assembly, one of which was\r\ndevoted to the role of the United Nations during the\r\ntwenty-first century (A/54/2000) and the other to the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/55/1), the one we are\r\ncurrently considering today.\r\nThe problems that we are facing are identified in\r\nthis report on the work of the Organization. Solutions\r\nare outlined. What remains is to act. Action is required\r\nurgently, for time is of the essence.\r\nAll delegations have asserted this a few days ago.\r\nWe have lived through an unprecedented event in\r\nhistory: the gathering of nearly 150 heads of State and\r\nGovernment. The conclusions of these historic\r\nmeetings reflect the fact that all peoples of the world\r\ngreatly aspire to peace and justice, to sustainable\r\nhuman development and to the reaffirmation of certain\r\nvalues which humanity shares, values without which,\r\nto speak like the poet, “the earth would no longer be\r\nthe earth”.\r\nOn the occasion of this Millennium Assembly, the\r\ninternational community displayed its confidence in\r\nour common future, facing the many challenges which\r\nit is confronting and will confront in the century which\r\nis dawning. Cameroon is particularly happy that the\r\ncentral role of the United Nations and its ideals were\r\nclearly reaffirmed, but President Paul Biya added on 7\r\nSeptember from this rostrum:\r\n“In truth our world needs ethics. As a set of\r\nmoral values, ethics constitute an essential\r\nexpectation on the part of the entire human\r\ncommunity as a whole.”\r\nIndeed it is through ethics that we will restore the\r\nindividual to the centre of our efforts. It is through\r\nethics that our decisions and deliberations will acquire\r\nnew dimensions. This is why we would like to reiterate\r\nthe proposal made by President Paul Biya for the\r\nestablishment within the Secretariat of the United\r\nNations of a committee, or an international\r\nobservatory, on ethics to promote among nations and\r\nwithin nations universal and fundamental human\r\nvalues.\r\nIt is undeniable that in a half-century of existence\r\nthe United Nations can be credited with many\r\nachievements in the promotion of peace, human rights\r\nand development. However, the work is far from\r\nover — quite the contrary. The Secretary-General notes\r\nthis in his report. New challenges are taking shape on\r\nthe horizon, and each day they confirm the need for\r\nradical reform of the United Nations in order for it to\r\nbecome an effective tool in the service of peoples.\r\nAt the same time, we have to make sure that the\r\nrole of the General Assembly is preserved. At the same\r\ntime, we also want the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil to be reviewed with a view to its enlargement,\r\nso as to ensure that there is much more equitable\r\nrepresentation that would take into account the changes\r\nin the world.\r\nThe persistence of areas of tension and conflict in\r\nthe world, and in particular in Africa, and the lessons\r\nfrom recent involvements of the United Nations in the\r\ncause of peace require the urgent adoption of adequate\r\nmeasures and the necessary resources in order to carry\r\nout truly effective peacekeeping operations.\r\nIn that connection, my country welcomes and\r\nsupports the conclusions and recommendations of the\r\nreport (A/55/305) of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations chaired by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. In our\r\nopinion, implementing those recommendations would\r\ngive the United Nations a real capacity to take action\r\nwhere “blue helmets” are deployed. United Nations\r\nforces must, in particular, consistently be given clear\r\nmandates and sufficient means to ensure the protection\r\nof civilians. My delegation will return to this matter\r\nwhen the Assembly considers the Brahimi report and\r\nanalyses its recommendations.\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations to promote peace should be\r\ndeveloped and encouraged. Here, it is important that\r\nthe operational capacities of those organizations be\r\nstrengthened to take full advantage of their proximity\r\nto the environment in which a conflict is taking place\r\nand of their familiarity with it. In that context, it is\r\nimportant to welcome the unflagging support of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the international community as a\r\nwhole for the efforts being made by the countries of\r\nCentral Africa to acquire a subregional system for the\r\nprevention and management of armed conflict and\r\ncrisis. It is worth recalling that such efforts recently led\r\nto the creation of the Council for Peace and Security in\r\nCentral Africa (COPAX), which is supported by a\r\nCentral African multinational force. The purpose of the\r\nforce is to carry out missions to maintain, restore and\r\nbuild peace. The countries of Central Africa hope that\r\nthe international community will actively support the\r\nimplementation of these mechanisms to enable them\r\nfully to play their role and to make it possible for the\r\npeoples of the subregion to emerge from the spiral of\r\nwar, violence, lack of security and fear in which they\r\nhave been trapped for so many years.\r\nBeyond efforts to put an end to hostilities, there is\r\nan urgent need to prevent conflicts by addressing their\r\nroot causes. That will be one of the major challenges\r\nfor the United Nations in the twenty-first century. It is\r\nworth recalling the popular adage that an ounce of\r\nprevention is worth a pound of cure. Here, the\r\nproliferation and illicit trafficking of small arms and\r\nlight weapons is a matter for grave concern. Besides\r\nexacerbating violent and murderous conflicts, that\r\ntrade undermines the security, stability and\r\ndevelopment of affected countries. The United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in all its Aspects, scheduled for 2001,\r\nshould lead to the adoption of a national, regional and\r\ninternational plan of action to help in effectively\r\ncombating this scourge, which too often undermines\r\npeace processes and post-conflict peace-building.\r\nA number of other speakers have mentioned the\r\nneed for conflict prevention, because unfortunately a\r\nvery high human and material cost attaches to conflict\r\nsettlement. That is why my country strongly favours a\r\nmore resolute commitment by the United Nations to\r\npromote a culture of peace. Here again, we will have\r\nan opportunity to return to this subject later in the\r\nsession.\r\nAnother cause of conflict for which it is\r\nimportant to mobilize the efforts of the United Nations\r\nand of the international community is poverty.\r\nCombating poverty should be the top priority for the\r\nUnited Nations. This necessarily requires a just and\r\nequitable solution to the problem of indebtedness,\r\nwhich is stifling the countries of the third world and\r\ndooming their development efforts to failure. Here\r\nagain, we should call upon the rich countries for\r\ngreater solidarity. A number of commendable efforts\r\nhave, of course, been made in this sphere, such as the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative. But decisive steps are still needed to\r\ngenuinely restore the development prospects of the\r\nmany countries whose meagre resources continue to be\r\nsucked into the vortex of debt servicing. The rich\r\ncountries must manifest the necessary political will and\r\nsolidarity. Such solidarity should be based on a clear-\r\nsighted perception of the interdependence of countries,\r\nregions and peoples. It should also be reflected with\r\nrespect to development assistance. Here, a troubling\r\ntrend towards fatigue is emerging, while new\r\nchallenges to humanity demand greater development\r\nassistance.\r\nThe inexorable progress of AIDS threatens the\r\nannihilation of entire nations and societies; the fight\r\nagainst that disease should mobilize the efforts of the\r\ninternational community and of the United Nations.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General reminds us in a\r\ntroubling way that AIDS is now killing four times as\r\nmany people in Africa each year as the continent’s\r\narmed conflicts. The Security Council’s January 2000\r\ndebate on this subject was one encouraging sign of a\r\ngrowing awareness of what is at stake in this terrifying\r\npandemic, which has become a grave threat to\r\ninternational stability. That is why my country,\r\nfollowing the recent thirteenth International AIDS\r\nConference, held in South Africa, calls for the\r\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly\r\non the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nGlobalization, another topic addressed in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, is another of the major\r\nchallenges for the future, when the United Nations\r\nmust demonstrate an ability to adapt to change. There\r\nis a striking contrast between the technological\r\nadvancement of a portion of humanity and the dire\r\npoverty of the rest. The United Nations is duty-bound\r\nto play a role in ensuring that the benefits of\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nglobalization are enjoyed by all peoples rather than\r\nbeing limited to a small group.\r\nIn the same spirit, we consider it important that\r\nthe international financial structures be reformed.\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and World Bank\r\nprogrammes for developing countries should be\r\nadapted in the light of our discussions here in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This is an opportunity for us to tell\r\nthe Assembly of Cameroon’s full support for the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals concerning international\r\npartnership.\r\nCameroon welcomes and encourages all change\r\ndirected towards peace and conflict resolution,\r\nthroughout the world. My country remains convinced\r\nthat the promotion of the rule of law and respect for\r\nhuman rights is an invaluable contribution to\r\nstrengthening international peace and security. This\r\nstrong conviction is the basis of our commitment to\r\ndemocracy and our deliberate choice of a legal\r\nsettlement of Cameroon’s dispute with Nigeria over the\r\nland and sea border.\r\nFinally, Cameroon will continue to make its\r\ncontribution to the United Nations peace efforts by\r\nmaking available, to the extent possible, its human,\r\nmaterial and financial resources to those missions and\r\noperations.\r\nMr. Buallay (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): Our\r\ndelegation has examined the Secretary-General’s report\r\non the work of the Organization. We would like to\r\nexpress to him our appreciation for all his efforts in\r\nassuming the enormous responsibility of managing the\r\nwork of the Organization and its actions based on the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, thus\r\nenabling the Organization to assume its important role\r\nin achieving international peace and security and\r\ncooperation among Member States in the economic and\r\nsocial areas.\r\nConcerning the establishment of peace and\r\nsecurity, we note that in paragraph 31 the Secretary-\r\nGeneral says:\r\n“collective security can no longer be narrowly\r\ndefined as the absence of armed conflict be it\r\nbetween or within States.” (A/55/1, para. 31)\r\nFor example, the vast displacement of civilian\r\npopulations has led to crises equal to those brought\r\nabout by wars and conflicts, because of the trials and\r\ntribulations of those displaced persons: hunger, thirst,\r\nlack of safe housing, the spread of disease and rising\r\ncrime rates. Moreover, international terrorism threatens\r\nthe stability and security of many States, leading to the\r\ndestruction of their economies.\r\nWith regard to disarmament, my country fully\r\nagrees with the Secretary-General, particularly in\r\nparagraph 103, and with his profound concern about\r\nthe continuing risk posed by nuclear weapons, despite\r\nsome progress in reducing them. The Arab Gulf region\r\nis one of the threatened areas. That is why we call for\r\nintensified international efforts to eliminate weapons of\r\nmass destruction in our region.\r\nWith regard to meeting humanitarian\r\ncommitments, paragraph 109 of the report refers to\r\nhumanitarian emergencies that far surpass the\r\nworst-case scenarios. We therefore call on the\r\nOrganization to adopt necessary and effective\r\nmeasures, including recommendations presented to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, to deal with humanitarian\r\nemergencies by mandating relevant United Nations\r\nauthorities to take such necessary measures. Bahrain\r\nalso believes that there is a need for coordinating\r\nefforts of humanitarian assistance and relief with\r\nrelevant non-governmental organizations.\r\nRegarding cooperation for development,\r\nparagraph 156 states that there are two challenges\r\nfacing development in the era of globalization: first, to\r\nguarantee the effective participation of all States in the\r\nglobal trading system, and, secondly, to promote social\r\nand environmental goals as an integral part of our\r\neconomic and financial strategies. Paragraph 157 of the\r\nreport refers to international concern about those\r\nchallenges. We believe that the General Assembly and\r\nits specialized organs should look into the matter so as\r\nto find internationally acceptable and practical ways to\r\ndeal with the problems hampering development in the\r\nglobalization era. The Secretary-General’s report has\r\nspoken of the issues that affect the international\r\ncommunity, of the importance of international\r\ncooperation and of guaranteeing the political will of\r\nMember States to achieve that cooperation in order to\r\nstrike a balance between the interests of States as a\r\nwhole and the individual national interests of each\r\nState individually.\r\nAnother matter we wish to touch upon is\r\npeacekeeping operations, which are experiencing an\r\nacute crisis for political and financial reasons. The\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nOrganization is finding it difficult to face these\r\nproblems. We continue to call for preventive diplomacy\r\nto prevent conflicts, but we realize that it is not\r\npossible in all cases and that each conflict has its own\r\ncharacteristics, not to mention the Organization’s\r\ncritical financial situation. The report of the Panel\r\npresided over by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi is very good,\r\nbut where are we to find the necessary financing to\r\nimplement its recommendations?\r\nThe United Nations is going through a critical\r\nstage at the beginning of the twenty-first century. We\r\nwere hoping that the situation would be better so that it\r\ncould enter the century stronger and more efficient.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): Permit me to compliment\r\nthe President on the skill with which he has conducted\r\nthe work of the Assembly and to say what a pleasure it\r\nis to see him presiding at this session.\r\nThe Assembly will be relieved to know that, to\r\nassist it in its work, I shall read out only portions of my\r\nsomewhat longer statement.\r\nWe join previous speakers in thanking the\r\nSecretary-General for his annual report on the work of\r\nthe Organization and for introducing it at the beginning\r\nof the general debate. We also thank him and the\r\nSecretariat for their tireless efforts to make the\r\nMillennium Summit a success.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has said, we must read\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization together\r\nwith the one he prepared for the Summit and, in\r\ndeciding on priorities for action, bear in mind what our\r\nleaders had to say when they met here earlier this\r\nmonth.\r\nWhen he spoke to the Millennium Assembly, the\r\nSecretary-General in effect said that to act on the\r\npriorities set by the Summit, the United Nations must\r\nwage four fights: for development, against injustice,\r\nagainst violence and for the environment. We are glad\r\nthat the Secretary-General sees those as tasks for the\r\nentire United Nations system to carry out because there\r\nwas some ambiguity in his report, which listed those\r\ntasks in the section on peace and security as elements\r\nof the even more ambiguous concept of human\r\nsecurity. This is not a quibble over words. Over the last\r\nfew years, the Security Council has used an elastic\r\nconcept of security to stretch its mandate well beyond\r\nwhat the Charter gave it. This is a development about\r\nwhich the majority of the membership of the United\r\nNations is deeply uncomfortable. We would not like\r\nthe Secretariat to promote this minority view.\r\nEconomic and social problems can constitute a threat\r\nto peace and security only if they are allowed to fester.\r\nThey cannot be addressed by bodies like the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nLast year, the Secretary-General asked the\r\nGeneral Assembly to consider the challenges raised by\r\nwhat has come to be known as humanitarian\r\nintervention. As he acknowledges in his report, the vast\r\nmajority of the membership rejected the concept. It is\r\nabsent from the Millennium Declaration, the silence of\r\nour leaders being proof that it has gained no currency\r\nin the course of a year. But, in his report this year, the\r\nSecretary-General asks\r\n“if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an\r\nunacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should\r\nwe respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica — to\r\ngross and systematic violations of human rights\r\nthat offend every precept of our common\r\nhumanity?” (A/55/1, para. 37)\r\nBy definition, those cases were exceptions to\r\nwhich an immediate and exceptional response should\r\nhave been forthcoming. That response was absent not\r\nbecause of an absence of doctrine. The international\r\ncommunity failed to act not because it did not have a\r\ntheoretical underpinning for action, but because of a\r\nfailure of political will and leadership. The danger in\r\ngeneralizing from exceptions is too obvious to have to\r\nbe belaboured. We understand and share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s concern, but humanitarian intervention is not\r\nthe answer.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that\r\npeacekeeping is a vital area of the work of the United\r\nNations. The surge in United Nations peacekeeping\r\nover the last year shows how much it is needed. The\r\nproblems that beset it must be corrected. We therefore\r\nwelcomed the appointment of the Brahimi Panel. With\r\nother Member States, we are carefully considering the\r\nPanel’s courageous and far-reaching report. We believe\r\nthat the Secretariat should not act piecemeal on its\r\nrecommendations, which should be implemented only\r\nafter they have been examined and approved by\r\nMember States.\r\nTowards the end of its report, the Brahimi Panel\r\nrefers in passing to a question that is crucial not only to\r\npeacekeeping, but to the credibility of the United\r\nNations. The Panel refers to that question as “equitable\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nrepresentation on the Security Council”. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly reminded the Assembly when he\r\nintroduced his report that our heads of State and\r\nGovernment have called for a reform that will make the\r\nCouncil more representative and legitimate, but also\r\nmore effective.\r\nThe Council cannot claim to act on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership in the present circumstances. The\r\nlack of adequate representation of developing countries\r\nin the Council severely impairs its functioning and\r\ncasts a shadow over the legitimacy of its decisions,\r\nwhich impact mainly on developing countries. We\r\ntherefore hope that the reform and expansion of the\r\nCouncil will receive, after the Millennium Summit, the\r\nattention it deserves. We share the hope expressed by\r\nthe President while closing the general debate that\r\nthere is a willingness by the majority to move forward\r\non this issue.\r\nThe Secretary-General and the United Nations\r\nsystem as a whole have placed increasing emphasis on\r\ngood governance. This might be a concept on which a\r\ncommon definition still eludes us, but there is a general\r\nconsensus that without democracy there can be no good\r\ngovernance. Like all democracies, we are pleased that\r\ndemocracy is increasingly the norm, casting aside\r\ndictatorships and authoritarian regimes. Yet, there has\r\nbeen some regression. In his report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral refers to two recent instances, but is silent on\r\nothers. We laud his commitment to work with the\r\nCommonwealth and the international community on the\r\nmatter of Fiji. We hope that he will use his moral\r\nauthority to build international opinion against the\r\nmilitary juntas that have overthrown democratically\r\nelected Governments and do nothing within the United\r\nNations that would either give them any respectability\r\nor reason to believe that the international community\r\nhad condoned their actions.\r\nInternational terrorism is the growing menace of\r\nour age, battening on open, liberal, democratic and\r\nlaw-abiding societies. It is a collective challenge to\r\nsocieties everywhere, and can be countered only\r\nthrough cooperative endeavour. In the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, our leaders committed themselves to\r\nconcerted action. We hope for the early adoption of the\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism now under\r\ndiscussion in the Assembly. In his report, the\r\nSecretary-General too has recognized terrorism as a\r\ndirect threat to our collective security. We hope that the\r\nSecretariat’s reports will focus more sharply than they\r\npresently do on international terrorists and the States\r\nthat sponsor, finance and assist them.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that\r\ndisarmament is a critical element of the United Nations\r\nstrategy for peace and security, and share his\r\nassessment that despite some progress in the reduction\r\nof nuclear weapons there is deep concern within the\r\ninternational community at the continuing risk posed\r\nby such weapons. We are disappointed that his report\r\ndoes not focus on the achievable goal of the complete\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. We believe that the\r\nUnited Nations has the foremost responsibility to\r\npromote nuclear disarmament. This should be both\r\narticulated and pursued as one of its highest priorities.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s leadership will be crucial in\r\nthat task, as well as in convening quickly the\r\ninternational conference to identify ways to eliminate\r\nnuclear dangers.\r\nAlthough the preamble of the Charter enjoins us\r\nto promote social progress and better standards of life\r\nand greater freedom, the United Nations record is\r\nmixed. As the Secretary-General has highlighted in\r\nparagraph 68 of his millennium report, half of the\r\nworld’s population still must try to survive on less than\r\n$2 a day. Some 1.2 billion people subsist on less than\r\n$1 a day. Removing such abject poverty must be the\r\nhighest priority for the United Nations, an organization\r\nthat would otherwise be irrelevant for the poor.\r\nMultilateral development cooperation must, therefore,\r\nbe the central tenet of the United Nations, and even\r\nmore so in the era of globalization and its pressures.\r\nThis requires the creation of an enabling\r\ninternational economic environment, transfer of\r\ntechnology, guaranteed special and differential\r\ntreatment to products and services of export interest of\r\ndeveloping countries, so that they can benefit from\r\nintegration in the global trading system and the like.\r\nThese are the issues on which the United Nations must\r\nact but where it is currently marginalized. The United\r\nNations has institutional centrality on this crucial issue\r\nfor future generations in the developing world and\r\nmust claim it for the general good.\r\nThe era of globalization and liberalization, in\r\nwhich we live today, promised to humankind\r\nopportunities of unprecedented prosperity, and it was\r\nhoped that the free flow of capital, goods and services\r\nwould bring about sustained and equitable economic\r\ngrowth for all nations. This, however, has not happened\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nand is not around the corner. The benefits have spread\r\nunevenly, resulting in a world where there is prosperity\r\nin a smaller part and poverty in the larger, where\r\ndisparities and incoming wealth between nations and\r\nwithin nations are widening.\r\nAs the Secretary-General pointed out in\r\nparagraph 155 of his annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, this has resulted in disquiet that is\r\nevident not only in the streets, as manifested in violent\r\nprotests in Seattle and, more recently, in the Czech\r\nRepublic, but also in the concerns about the\r\nconsequences of globalization that pervade much of the\r\ndeveloping world. To enable globalization to be a\r\npowerful and dynamic force for growth and\r\ndevelopment, it is essential that its benefits spread\r\nmore equitably and the process be made more\r\ninclusive.\r\nThe United Nations has an institutional\r\nresponsibility to conduct the discourse on the\r\nuniversally advantageous and corrective course of the\r\nglobalization process. The Secretary-General has\r\ncorrectly pointed out in paragraph 16 of his annual\r\nreport that these goals cannot be achieved without\r\neffective global institutions. We believe that global\r\nfinancial instability and volatility of capital flows pose\r\nserious problems for sustained economic development\r\nin developing countries; therefore, urgent reforms in\r\nthe international financial architecture must be\r\nundertaken. We hope that the high-level event on\r\nfinancing for development to be held in 2001 will offer,\r\nwe hope, the international community an opportunity to\r\ncomprehensively address the diverse aspects of\r\ndevelopment, including the strengthening of\r\ninternational financial institutions for developmental\r\npurposes.\r\nIndia believes that the test of economic growth\r\nand development is that it must bring about palpable\r\nimprovement in the lives of the people. We are\r\nheartened to note that, while identifying the elimination\r\nof poverty worldwide as the most important goal of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Secretary-General has, in\r\nparagraph 168 of his annual report, emphasized the\r\nneed for a new commitment on the part of the\r\ninternational community to transform paper targets into\r\nconcrete achievements.\r\nOn the subject of the environment, while\r\ndeveloping countries have done commendable work in\r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21, the commitments\r\nundertaken by developed countries to make available\r\nnew additional financial resources and environmentally\r\nsound technology on concessional terms to developing\r\ncountries remain unfulfilled. We agree with the\r\nSecretary-General’s assessment that the Rio Plus Ten\r\nreview process should provide an opportunity to\r\nreassess what progress has been made towards\r\nachieving the targets established by the 1992 United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development.\r\nWe also hope that at the Rio Plus Ten meeting the\r\ninternational community will reinvigorate the global\r\npartnership needed to achieve the goals of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe have noted from paragraph 187 the work\r\nbeing done by the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme (UNEP) and the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in\r\nthe field of environmental trade. We must caution that\r\nthis should not in any way promote new\r\nconditionalities on trade and assistance.\r\nFinally, I come to the crucial problem of\r\nresources. The Secretary-General refers more than once\r\nto the incompatibility between approved mandates and\r\nthe resources available for their implementation. When\r\nthe Secretary-General says in paragraph 296 of his\r\nreport that he could “do more with less, but only up to\r\na point”, we agree. And we agree even more with his\r\nappeal to the Assembly not to condemn the United\r\nNations to operating with a budget frozen in time. We\r\nare concerned that, as the report recalls, “the level of\r\nunpaid assessments ... remains unacceptably high”.\r\nThis long-standing problem must be urgently resolved.\r\nIn conclusion, I recall the Secretary-General’s\r\nreminder that our task, and his, is to swiftly translate\r\nthe Millennium Declaration into reality. It was perhaps\r\napt that at this first General Assembly of a new century\r\nthere should have been a touch of Janus in the choice\r\nof the quotation with which the Secretary-General\r\nbegan his address. The paean to colonialism from\r\nwhich he quoted, Rudyard Kipling’s tellingly named\r\n“Recessional”, is full of poor politics but better poetry,\r\nand it has two other lines that we would also do well to\r\nrecall as we move forward:\r\n“Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,\r\nLest we forget — lest we forget”.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Tunisia.\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nMr. Ben Mustapha (Tunisia) (spoke in French):\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for the exhaustive report he has submitted\r\nto the current fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly on the work of the Organization during the\r\npast year.\r\nAs he does every year, the Secretary-General has\r\npainted a full picture of the United Nations activities\r\nover the past 12 months. The report retraces the many\r\ndiverse tasks of the Organization and highlights the\r\nchallenges it faces every day in playing its role in\r\naccordance with the objectives of the Charter.\r\nThe Declaration adopted at the conclusion of the\r\nMillennium Summit shows us the road to follow in\r\nrising to the challenges that the Secretary-General has\r\nanalysed clearly and sagaciously in his report, “We the\r\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century”, and in the report before us today on the\r\nwork of the Organization. His view of the world’s\r\nsituation and prospects is thereby reinforced.\r\nThe scope of the Organization’s field of action\r\ncovered in the Secretary-General’s report, as well as\r\nthe brief time available to consider it, require us to\r\nfocus our attention on some aspects of the report, on\r\nwhich we should like to make the following comments.\r\nWe fully share the Secretary-General’s opinion on\r\nthe need for the community of nations to consider\r\nglobally the various elements contributing to common\r\nsecurity as the only approach likely to lead to the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace. Indeed, the international\r\ncommunity is called on to adopt this global and\r\nmultidimensional approach, which takes account of the\r\nlinks, interaction and interdependence between the\r\nobjectives of the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, development, the eradication of poverty,\r\nthe protection of human rights and the promotion of\r\ndemocracy and good governance.\r\nIt is this approach that Tunisia has adopted and is\r\nimplementing tirelessly. The Millennium Declaration\r\nstrengthens this approach at the world level by making\r\nthese fields of action the highest future priorities of the\r\ninternational community and by affirming the\r\nimportance of interaction among those fields and their\r\ninfluence on each other.\r\nIn the context of the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, we wish to refer to the question of\r\npeacekeeping operations, to the consideration of which\r\nthe Secretary-General has rightly devoted an important\r\nplace in his report. The Organization is currently at a\r\nkey stage in its action in this field following the\r\nsubmission of three major reports, two of which\r\naddress the United Nations experience in Rwanda and\r\nSrebrenica, while the third is of a more general scope,\r\nproviding a global summary of United Nations activity\r\nin this field and a vision for the future. The latter\r\nreport, submitted last August by the Panel chaired by\r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, contains important\r\nrecommendations that require the attention of all\r\nMember States and in-depth consideration, addressing\r\nas they do the fundamental functions of the\r\nOrganization in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. My delegation will actively participate in\r\nthe Organization’s deliberations on this report.\r\nWe endorse the Panel’s statement on the need to\r\nstrengthen the Organization’s peacekeeping activities\r\nthrough the adoption of measures related to various\r\naspects of these operations, including enhancing the\r\ncapacities of the Secretariat, intensifying consultations\r\nbetween the Security Council and the troop-\r\ncontributing countries, improving the conditions of\r\ndeployment of these operations and other aspects. We\r\nalso stress the need for the Organization to ensure that\r\nany reform designed to improve its capacity does not\r\nflout the sacrosanct principles of state sovereignty,\r\nterritorial integrity and political independence and of\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. These\r\nprinciples are the foundations of the system of\r\ninternational relations on which its very survival is\r\nbased. They must continue to guide the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to address all the world’s\r\nemergencies, including those in which humanitarian\r\nsituations become major challenges that must be\r\nunequivocally met.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly stresses the need\r\nfor increased action in support of conflict-prevention.\r\nIndeed, today more than ever, conflict-prevention must\r\nbecome a global and integrated strategy to ensure in\r\nthe long term not only the absence of armed conflict,\r\nbut that conditions remain conducive to political,\r\neconomic, social and cultural peace. The international\r\ncommunity has the means to adopt such a strategy;\r\nwhat it needs is the will to implement it.\r\nIt seems to me that a sensible and viable long-\r\nterm conflict-prevention strategy must take account of\r\nthe profound causes of conflicts and of the violence\r\nthat feeds and flows from them, which often originates\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nin the poor economic and social conditions of the\r\npeople they engulf — in other words, in\r\nunderdevelopment and poverty.\r\nWe believe that effective management of the\r\nrequirements of economic and social development\r\nwould substantially contribute to preventing the causes\r\nof the conflicts and violence prevailing in several\r\nregions of the world. In this vein, we believe it\r\nnecessary to accelerate the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the countries of the South, particularly\r\nthe poorest among them. Africa is certainly a continent\r\nthat calls for particular attention on the part of the\r\ninternational community. The Millennium Summit\r\nclearly stressed that need.\r\nBefore I conclude my statement, I wish to refer to\r\nthe question of sanctions and to stress the interest that\r\nshould be accorded to the ongoing improvement and\r\nrefining of their use as a tool at the service of\r\ninternational peace and security. The experience of the\r\npast decade has demonstrated the need to change the\r\nway sanctions are used so as to alleviate their negative\r\neffects on peoples, the significance of which we have\r\nnoted particularly in the case of such general sanctions\r\nregimes as that which has been imposed on Iraq over\r\nthe course of the past 10 years.\r\nAny reform of the practice of imposing sanctions\r\nshould take account of certain criteria, including in\r\nparticular the resort to sanctions only as a last resort\r\nonce all peaceful means have been exhausted. When\r\nsanctions prove necessary, their duration should be\r\nlimited and clear conditions defined for their lifting or\r\nsuspension. There must also be a continuous evaluation\r\nof the humanitarian repercussions on the people of\r\ntargeted countries and of the sanctions’ direct impact\r\non the interests of third countries.\r\nMr. Petrič (Slovenia): This being the first time I\r\nhave had the honour to address the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-fifth session, I wish to add my voice to all\r\nthose that have congratulated Mr. Holkeri on his\r\nassumption of his important post. My delegation is\r\nready to lend its full support to his endeavours to\r\nconduct the work of this session to a successful\r\noutcome.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General for his annual report on the work of\r\nthe Organization. It provides us with a comprehensive\r\nyet concise overview of the activities of the United\r\nNations. It also offers a number of new ideas on how to\r\nconduct these activities in the future. In conjunction\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s millennium report, the\r\nannual report gives us a unique opportunity to\r\nexchange our views on issues before us and to try to\r\nchart a course for action to be taken by the United\r\nNations and this Assembly.\r\nAllow me briefly to touch upon a set of issues\r\nthat my delegation finds of particular importance.\r\nThe first is the “dilemma of intervention”, a topic\r\nthat has been at the centre of discussions during the\r\nMillennium Summit and the general debate this year. In\r\nhis report, the Secretary-General rightly points to the\r\nchanging nature of threats to peace and security. Today\r\nthe United Nations is increasingly confronted with\r\nintra-State conflicts. It should therefore come as no\r\nsurprise that in dealing with these conflicts we\r\nencounter a dilemma between so-called humanitarian\r\nintervention and respect for State sovereignty.\r\nIf we want the United Nations to act effectively\r\nto prevent the worst kinds of mass crimes and to be an\r\neffective guardian of international peace and security,\r\nwe cannot avoid addressing this dilemma. The United\r\nNations Member States in general, and the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council in particular, should\r\nact in accordance with the Charter and their shared\r\nresponsibility for peace and security. In the present\r\ncontext, this means that we should not shy away from\r\nthe issue of intervention, however complex it may be.\r\nIf we do so, it we will be accepting either passivity on\r\nthe part of the United Nations with respect to the\r\ngravest kinds of mass crimes, or the dangerous threat\r\nof interventions bypassing the United Nations.\r\nWe note and share the fear expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General that, given the reaction to his views\r\non humanitarian intervention, we may fail again next\r\ntime to prevent tragedies of dramatic proportions such\r\nas the ones that took place in Rwanda and Srebrenica.\r\nBut we should not wait and see if this fear is realized.\r\nWe should not wait for new atrocities to happen and\r\nthen see if the international community again witnesses\r\nthem passively. We should now, without delay, discuss\r\npossible ways to lay the foundation for adequate\r\npreventive action, including intervention, if and when\r\nnecessary. Without any doubt, the Security Council in\r\nparticular should serve as the framework for, and guide\r\nof, this process.\r\nIn our view, the United Nations is the most\r\nappropriate forum for this kind of discussion. We\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nbelieve there is an urgent need to elaborate in advance\r\nthe standards and doctrine for humanitarian\r\nintervention, based on a modern interpretation of the\r\nCharter and in line with international relations and\r\nnorms. For this reason we welcome the Canadian\r\ninitiative and the establishment of the International\r\nCommission on Intervention and State Sovereignty. We\r\nlook forward to the findings and recommendations of\r\nthis Commission. Hopefully, the input by this\r\nCommission will help States to reach consensus on the\r\nchallenge posed by the “dilemma of intervention”.\r\nThrough the adoption of the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, a large majority of States\r\nhave clearly demonstrated their will to put an end to\r\nimpunity. The establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court is in many ways a historic step. For the\r\nfirst time in history, there is a mechanism in sight\r\nwhich will, it is hoped, ensure that those responsible\r\nfor the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and\r\nwar crimes, wherever committed, will not go\r\nunpunished. We hope that the necessary number of\r\nratifications will be deposited soon, so as to enable the\r\nCourt to function. The National Assembly of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia is to ratify the Rome Statute\r\nbefore the end of the year.\r\nAnother aspect of improving the effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations relates to its peace operations. We\r\ncommend the initiative by the Secretary-General to\r\nestablish the Panel on Peace Operations, which, under\r\nthe chairmanship of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, recently\r\nissued a landmark report on the shortcomings of\r\ncurrent practices and on ways to overcome them. We\r\nsupport the Panel’s recommendations and hope for\r\ntheir early implementation. Some of these\r\nrecommendations will require additional resources, and\r\nSlovenia is willing to contribute its share. As my\r\nForeign Minister already stated in his address to the\r\nAssembly, Slovenia has decided to voluntarily\r\nrelinquish the discount it has enjoyed in the current\r\npeacekeeping scale of assessments. Accordingly,\r\nbeginning next year, Slovenia will contribute its full\r\nshare to the cost of peacekeeping operations.\r\nI wish also to share some thoughts on the\r\nphenomenon of globalization. Recent events in Prague,\r\nalong with those that took place earlier in Seattle,\r\njustify the placement of globalization among the top\r\nissues addressed by the Secretary-General’s report. No\r\nmatter how pleased or displeased we may be with it,\r\nglobalization is inevitable and probably unstoppable.\r\nMany feel marginalized and powerless in face of the\r\nforces of globalization. What we can do about it,\r\nthough, is important: we can strive, on the one hand, to\r\nmaximize its potential to improve people’s lives\r\nworldwide, and, on the other hand, to prevent or\r\nalleviate its negative effects.\r\nGlobalization should not translate into an\r\nunbridled quest by private corporations for the\r\ncheapest labour and highest returns, with no regard for\r\nsocial welfare or the environment. On the contrary,\r\nglobalization can and should serve as a powerful\r\ninstrument to bring decent wages, social progress,\r\nprosperity and high environmental standards to every\r\ncorner of the world. For this to happen, Governments,\r\nprivate corporations and international economic and\r\nfinancial institutions, as well as civil society and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, should cooperate with a\r\nview to ensuring the effective management of global\r\neconomic and social affairs. Without such\r\nmanagement, the idea of spreading the benefits of\r\nglobalization will remain an illusion.\r\nIn this context, we encourage the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to build further on his initiative for a Global\r\nCompact and to aim for an early definition, and even\r\ncodification, of good practices to be observed by all\r\nactors of globalization.\r\nMr. Dausá Céspedes (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe Millennium Summit has recently concluded, and\r\nthe international community is now awaiting concrete\r\nresults. The report submitted to us by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral this year — and we are very grateful to him for\r\nit — constitutes, in our opinion, a valuable reference\r\ndocument on the most recent successes and failures of\r\nour Organization, and therefore a useful instrument in\r\ndesigning and undertaking future actions.\r\nThe so-called intervention dilemma is reiterated\r\nonce again in the Secretary-General’s report. Cuba’s\r\nstance on this question is well known.\r\nWe cannot hope to see the United Nations\r\ncontribute to the advent of a safer world if neo-\r\ninterventionism disguised as humanitarian action is\r\nlegitimized. The security problems we face today will\r\nnever be resolved through these so-called humanitarian\r\ninterventions, which not only pose a grave threat to the\r\nsecurity and stability of developing countries, but place\r\nthe United Nations in a subordinate position, subject to\r\nthe designs of hegemonistic interests.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nCertain States are increasingly ignoring the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, which\r\nhave governed international relations for 50 years, and\r\neven seeking to do away with them. The current\r\ninternational order — which is unjust and profoundly\r\ninequitable — cannot be replaced by an even more\r\nprimitive one based on a reinterpretation of the Charter\r\nand of international law.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General as to the\r\nimportance of conflict prevention. The cost of\r\nprevention is minimal compared to the losses incurred\r\nas a result of conflicts. But in order to be truly\r\neffective, prevention strategies require continuing\r\nefforts, often unobtrusive and low-profile in the context\r\nof the media.\r\nThe best form of prevention, and in the long term\r\nthe only effective one, is to deal with the root causes of\r\nconflicts, in particular problems related to economic\r\nand social development. It is not by chance that in the\r\npast 10 years, more than half of the 45 poorest\r\ncountries of the world have been the scene of armed\r\nconflict or other forms of extreme violence. If due\r\nattention is not given to the adverse effects of the\r\nimposition of a neo-liberal model in a globalized\r\nworld, and if the gap between rich and poor countries\r\ncontinues to grow, inevitably we will see an increase in\r\ncrisis and conflicts.\r\nIn the last decade the Security Council has made\r\nmuch more frequent use of sanctions. However, this\r\nincreased usage has not been accompanied by the\r\nelimination or even a reduction in the number of\r\nconflicts. The imposition of sanctions should be an\r\nextreme measure, and not — as is frequently the case\r\ntoday — a means of punishing certain countries, in\r\npursuit of the narrow national interests of specific\r\nmembers of the Security Council.\r\nCan anyone seriously claim that it is never\r\njustifiable to impose sanctions against developed\r\ncountries that have endangered international peace and\r\nsecurity? However, it is not surprising that, since the\r\nSecurity Council is a body in which the developing\r\ncountries are completely under-represented, the 15\r\nsanctions regimes imposed thus far by the Council have\r\nall been imposed on countries of the developing world.\r\nIt is particularly telling that almost 70 per cent of the\r\nsanctions currently in force are directed against African\r\ncountries.\r\nWe are pleased that in the section devoted to\r\nhuman rights development the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral includes a subsection on “Challenges ahead”.\r\nHowever, probably for reasons of space, it is extremely\r\nshort and makes no reference to a group of questions\r\nthat are of great importance to Cuba. A minority group\r\nof countries has been imposing its approach and views\r\non decisions adopted at the international level in the\r\nfield of human rights. With but one exception, all the\r\nresolutions concerning countries adopted by the\r\nCommission on Human Rights since 1990 cite\r\nunderdeveloped countries as the violators of human\r\nrights, and all those resolutions were proposed by\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWe must halt the political manipulation of human\r\nrights, the selectivity, partiality and double standards\r\nthat prevail in the imposition of rigid norms. We must\r\nnot allow the imposition of absolutist ideas of\r\ndemocracy based on foreign models that in general\r\nreflect the approach of the former colonial Powers.\r\nDespite a certain optimistic tone in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General with its mention of the results of\r\nthe year 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT), it is regrettable that some nuclear-weapon\r\nStates tried until the last moment to prevent inclusion\r\nin the final Declaration of the Millennium Summit of\r\neven a timid appeal for the convening of an\r\ninternational conference to identify ways of eliminating\r\nnuclear dangers. This position is at variance with the\r\ncommitment by the nuclear-weapon States to eliminate\r\nsuch weapons.\r\nMoreover, how is it possible to explain that, as\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General reveals, in 1999\r\nannual military expenditures increased for the first time\r\nin the post-cold-war period, rising to approximately\r\n$780 billion? How much could be achieved if only a\r\nvery small part of that money were used to promote\r\ndevelopment?\r\nThe payment crisis created by the Organization’s\r\nprincipal contributor, in order to impose that country’s\r\npolicies, is affecting the proper functioning of the\r\nOrganization. The zero-growth budget policy — also\r\nimposed by the principal contributor — is unworkable,\r\nas it undermines the United Nations capacity to fulfil\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter, in particular\r\nthose that relate to economic and social development,\r\nand leads to the imposition of certain priorities far from\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nthe interests and needs of the majority of Member\r\nStates.\r\nCuba believes that the discussions to be held on\r\nreform of the scale of assessments for the regular\r\nbudget and of the special scale for the financing of\r\npeacekeeping operations should result in the\r\nelimination of the ceiling on the scale of assessments\r\nand the institutionalization of the current special scale.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to refer briefly to the\r\nreport (A/55/305) on peace operations prepared by a\r\nPanel of experts appointed by the Secretary-General,\r\nwhose recommendations have very significant\r\nimplications for the future of the United Nations.\r\nWhile some of the recommendations take into account\r\nlegitimate proposals that many of us have been\r\nreiterating in recent years, a significant number of\r\nothers — many concerning matters outside the\r\ncompetence of the Secretary-General — give cause for\r\nconcern, at the very least. In any case, there is an\r\nobvious need for a process of wide-ranging and\r\ntransparent discussion within the framework of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, where all Member States can\r\nparticipate and where it may be possible to reach\r\nconsensus on these essential subjects. Cuba will\r\nparticipate actively in this process.\r\nMr. Adam (Belgium) (spoke in French): I\r\ncommend the excellent report of the Secretary-General\r\nthat the General Assembly is considering today.\r\nBefore turning to several points of substance, I\r\nwould like to emphasize what my country believes is\r\nthe major conclusion of the Millennium Summit. This\r\nis that — despite the criticisms regularly directed at our\r\nOrganization, criticisms that are justified at times —\r\nthe Organization is playing and will continue to play a\r\ncentral role in the response of the international\r\ncommunity to the many challenges with which it is\r\nconfronted: above all, the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, but also human development, the\r\nmanagement of both the opportunities and the\r\nchallenges of globalization, and the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights. During the discussions of\r\nthis fifty-fifth session we must bear in mind this\r\nunanimous show of support.\r\nWe note first the part of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General that shows a substantial increase in\r\nthe resources devoted to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations; our Organization is now deploying 45,000\r\nmilitary and 13,000 civilian personnel, with the\r\nfinancial consequences that we all know. Further, the\r\nreport (A/55/305) drafted at the Secretary-General’s\r\nrequest by a Panel of eminent persons chaired by Mr.\r\nBrahimi makes a series of recommendations on the\r\nmandates and conduct of peacekeeping operations,\r\nrecommendations that have received broad support\r\nfrom Member States. This report is based on findings\r\nof the troop-contributing countries themselves and\r\ndraws lessons that we fully endorse. The\r\nimplementation of these recommendations will come\r\nwith a cost that will have to be borne in an equitable\r\nmanner. It is desirable that the next report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization, in\r\n2001, should be able to speak of significant progress in\r\nthis field. That is why all of us, and in particular the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, must\r\nalways bear in mind the strong message delivered to us\r\nby the heads of State and Government on the\r\nirreplaceable role of the United Nations as a guarantor\r\nof world peace.\r\nA second issue on which the Secretary-General is\r\nrightly focusing his sustained attention is that of\r\nglobalization and of its consequences for our countries.\r\nWe are compelled to note, as numerous heads of State\r\nand Government have already done, that the available\r\nopportunities are shared in a most unequal manner by\r\nMember States. Here again our Organization is\r\nchallenged to find elements of response very quickly,\r\nand it is working at that actively, albeit with much\r\ndifficulty, particularly in the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn this context, I would like to commend once\r\nagain the initiatives of the Secretary-General with a\r\nview to making our Organization reach out to and\r\nindeed enter into partnership with organizations in civil\r\nsociety and the private sector, which play determining\r\nroles in the multidimensional management of\r\ntomorrow’s world. This is another aspect of the\r\npioneering action of our Organization in adapting itself\r\nto a changing world. The meeting of presiding officers\r\nof parliaments that preceded the Millennium Summit\r\nalso reminded us very appropriately of the concerns of\r\nthe elected officials of our nations relating to these\r\nchanges.\r\nOn the occasion of this debate, I would like to\r\nwelcome certain advances made this past year that\r\ndeserves particular attention. First, the year 2000 will\r\nbe remembered as the year when the United Nations\r\nreally came to terms with Africa, following the\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nissuance in 1998 of the report of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled “The causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa”\r\n(S/1998/318), and through the efforts of a number of\r\nMember States, including Belgium. In the future we\r\nmust work to ensure that Africa will not be left behind\r\nby globalization.\r\nThe special session on the follow-up of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the special session\r\nof the General Assembly on Beijing + Five both made\r\nit possible for the United Nations to reaffirm that the\r\nhuman being is at the centre of its development efforts\r\nand to make progress towards a recognition of the\r\nuniversality of certain concepts, in particular women’s\r\nrights in society.\r\nNext there is the resolute action of the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),\r\nwhich makes it possible at least to contain to a degree\r\nthe spread of the HIV/AIDS virus, if not to put an end\r\nto it. This pandemic constitutes both a human and an\r\neconomic disaster for a great many countries and is\r\ntherefore a factor of profound destabilization.\r\nBelgium would like to voice its concern regarding\r\nthe humanitarian field, in particular regarding the\r\ndifficulties encountered by the humanitarian personnel\r\nof the United Nations, in terms of having access to\r\nzones of conflict, which is often refused to them, as\r\nwell as their own security, often precarious, as was\r\ndemonstrated by the murder of three staff members of\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees (UNHCR) in West Timor on the eve of\r\nthe Millennium Summit. The list of victims is\r\nbecoming longer from year to year. We must\r\neffectively protect those staff members and firmly\r\npunish their attackers.\r\nFurthermore, like the Secretary-General, we\r\nshould all be concerned by the fact that the response to\r\nthe needs announced in the first consolidated inter-\r\nagency appeal this year amounted to only 34 per cent\r\nof needs, even though the needs in humanitarian aid are\r\nimmense and economic growth would allow the release\r\nof financial gains that would have been quite\r\nunexpected only a few years ago.\r\nLastly, the absence of agreement among Member\r\nStates regarding internally displaced persons resulting\r\nfrom internal conflicts in the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s July segment is a deeply regrettable failure\r\nfor our Organization. We hope that this will be\r\ncorrected during the current session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI cannot leave the subject of the humanitarian\r\nfield without expressing my Government’s sincerest\r\ncongratulations to Mrs. Sadako Ogata for her activities\r\nat the head of UNHCR, as she will be leaving at the\r\nend of this year. She fully deserves our gratitude.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to say a word about the\r\nreform of the Security Council, another subject that\r\nwas at the centre of the concerns of the heads of State\r\nat the Millennium Summit. In order to ensure the\r\ncredibility, representativeness, and effectiveness of that\r\nleading organ of our Organization, a reform is urgent.\r\nWhen it comes to such a technically complex and\r\npolitically sensitive question, I would encourage the\r\nSecretary-General to tirelessly continue his mediation\r\nefforts, as he is doing in many areas, to ensure that the\r\nmomentum of the search for a solution is not\r\nexhausted.\r\nMr. Lancry (Israel): The annual report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/55/1) reveals quite clearly and quite impressively\r\nthe myriad activities in which the United Nations and\r\nits bodies have been involved over the past year. The\r\nreport stresses the following three issues which we\r\nbelieve deserve special attention: the AIDS pandemic,\r\nthe United Nations role in peacekeeping and the\r\ncoordinated management of globalization.\r\nAfrica has been identified by the United Nations\r\nas the continent most deserving of our attention. As the\r\nSecretary-General’s report has so starkly presented, the\r\nAIDS pandemic is destroying the social and economic\r\nfabric of entire countries in that continent. It has\r\nreversed years of development efforts and has placed\r\nan unbearable burden upon States, societies and\r\ncommunities. We welcome and are encouraged by the\r\nattention and effort which the United Nations is\r\nexpending to confront this scourge, and we look\r\nforward to the discussion of this issue next week in the\r\nGeneral Assembly plenary and in the upcoming special\r\nsession of the General Assembly devoted exclusively\r\nto this horrific crisis. We firmly support the timely\r\nadoption of a practical and decisive international plan\r\nof action to confront this challenge.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations, the recent report of the Panel on Peace\r\nOperations drew special attention to the lack of\r\nresources which has plagued those operations and had a\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nserious impact on their ability to fulfil their goals. It is\r\nnow clear that effective and predictable financial\r\nsupport is crucial to the success of any peace mission.\r\nIn this regard, we support initiatives to modify the\r\nscale of assessments so as to distribute the financial\r\nburdens of these operations more equitably. We will\r\nsupport efforts to introduce a 25 per cent ceiling on\r\nindividual assessments.\r\nAt this time, Israel wishes to inform the General\r\nAssembly of its decision to forgo the 80 per cent\r\nreduction it had previously enjoyed and to pay its full\r\nassessment to the United Nations peacekeeping budget.\r\nThirdly, the report’s discussion of globalization\r\nhighlights the challenges and opportunities inherent in\r\nthe current race towards economic integration. The\r\nforces of globalization have the power to both enrich\r\nand impoverish. A country’s openness to integration\r\nand free markets can help to alleviate poverty and\r\ndisease, but it can also serve to increase its\r\nvulnerability to the impact of volatile global markets.\r\nIsrael firmly supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nGlobal Compact initiative, as well as the promotion of\r\n“coalitions for change”, as a valuable means to harness\r\nthe productive potential of globalization, to distribute\r\nits rewards more evenly and to maximize the ability of\r\nnational Governments to protect their citizens from the\r\npitfalls of the open market. The Secretary-General’s\r\nannual report has indeed demonstrated the wide-\r\nranging and comprehensive role played by this\r\nOrganization around the globe.\r\nFrom Israel’s perspective, this year has been very\r\nsignificant for our relationship with the United\r\nNations. Two events in particular have signalled to\r\nIsrael, its citizens and its supporters worldwide that the\r\nUnited Nations may indeed have the capacity to relate\r\nto Israel as a nation like any other.\r\nFirst, this year marks Israel’s temporary\r\nacceptance into the Group of Western European and\r\nOther States. Our inclusion in that group will help to\r\nrectify an anomaly that has affected no other nation. It\r\nis an important step, albeit a first step, towards Israel’s\r\nfull integration into the United Nations. For the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality as laid down in Article\r\n2 of the Charter to be fully realized, Israel must be\r\naccepted in a regional grouping in all United Nations\r\nheadquarters around the world and must become\r\neligible for the same candidatures as are all other\r\nUnited Nations Members. At the same time, we remain\r\ncommitted to achieving membership among our natural\r\npartners in the Asian Group. In lieu of that\r\nmembership, however, our inclusion in the Group of\r\nWestern European and Other States will serve to\r\nincrease our ability to participate as a full and equal\r\nMember State. The Secretary-General’s efforts in this\r\nmetamorphosis were, and will continue to be, crucial to\r\nits success.\r\nThe second event was the unprecedented\r\ncoordination that existed between the United Nations\r\nand Israel with regard to the pullout of Israeli forces\r\nfrom southern Lebanon. In full coordination with the\r\nUnited Nations, and in keeping with Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978), Israel withdrew its forces from\r\nsouthern Lebanon on 24 May 2000. Following the\r\nwithdrawal, the United Nations worked to confirm\r\nIsrael’s fulfilment of its part of the resolution. On 16\r\nJune 2000, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nsubmitted his report to the Security Council on the\r\nimplementation of Council resolutions 425 (1978) and\r\n426 (1978). That detailed document reflected hundreds\r\nof hours of briefings with Israeli and Lebanese\r\nofficials, discussions with the national leaders of the\r\ntwo States, inspections on the ground by United\r\nNations officials and an investigation of the line of\r\nwithdrawal. In his conclusion, the Secretary-General\r\nstated unequivocally:\r\n“I can report to the Security Council that Israel\r\nhas withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in\r\naccordance with resolution 425 (1978)”.\r\n(S/2000/590, para. 40)\r\nThe Security Council in turn welcomed the report,\r\nendorsed its conclusions and cleared the way for the\r\ncompletion of the implementation of its resolution 425\r\n(1978).\r\nIt must be recalled that, in addition to calling for\r\nthe withdrawal of Israeli forces, Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978) also calls for the restoration of\r\ninternational peace and security and for the return of\r\nthe effective authority of the Government of Lebanon\r\nin the area. Now that Israel has withdrawn its forces,\r\nand now that the United Nations has confirmed its full\r\ncompliance with Council resolution 425 (1978), we call\r\nonce again upon the other parties to fulfil their\r\nremaining obligations under that resolution so that\r\npeace and security may come, at long last, to that area.\r\nIsrael hopes that this transitional period in\r\nsouthern Lebanon will open a new chapter of peace and\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.30\r\nsecurity along the border and of mutual trust between\r\nthe people of Israel and the people of Lebanon. It\r\nrecognizes and appreciates the efforts of the United\r\nNations and of the Secretary-General in promoting that\r\ngoal.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization is broad in its outlook and global in\r\nits scope. It demonstrates the multi-faceted activities of\r\nthe United Nations and its bodies over the past year.\r\nYet beyond that, from Israel’s perspective, this year of\r\nUnited Nations activity has marked a significant step\r\nforward in both our integration into the United Nations\r\nsystem and in the degree of cooperation between us\r\nand the Organization. We are satisfied by these\r\ndevelopments and, in the spirit of Article 2 of the\r\nCharter, look forward in the coming year to beginning\r\na new era of equality in Israel’s status in the family of\r\nnations.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report has clearly\r\nindicated, the resolution of conflicts and the building of\r\npeace rank very high among the concerns of the nations\r\nof the world. It is of the highest concern to us as well.\r\nWe in the Middle East stand on the threshold of\r\nhistoric decisions. It is our hope that those decisions\r\nwill be taken imminently and that they will lead to a\r\njust, lasting and comprehensive peace for us and for\r\ngenerations to come. May it be God’s will that next\r\nyear’s report of the Secretary-General on the work of\r\nthe Organization will also include a few paragraphs\r\ndescribing the achievement of lasting peace in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
