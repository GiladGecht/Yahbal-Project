(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/55/1)\r\nMr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova): Allow me\r\nto complement you, Mr. President, on the manner in\r\nwhich you have conducted the proceedings of the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly and to wish you\r\nevery success.\r\nI also wish to thank the Secretary-General for a\r\nstimulating and comprehensive annual report on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/55/1). We also commend\r\nhim for his decision to introduce the report, as was\r\ndone during the past three years, in a plenary meeting\r\nat the outset of the general debate, allowing us to focus\r\nbetter in the ministerial debate. This is a welcome\r\narrangement, which should continue in the future.\r\nThe report under consideration gives up a broad\r\nand analytical perspective on what the United Nations\r\ndoes and what it expects to do. It also provides an\r\nopportunity to review whether the United Nations is\r\nequipped to meet present and future challenges by\r\ndelivering approaches and recommendations focused\r\non areas where the United Nations can make a real\r\ndifference.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s depiction of problems that currently confront\r\nthe international community. Like many other\r\ndelegations, we also believe that globalization is\r\namong the most important challenges facing us all.\r\nNevertheless, the challenges addressed first and\r\nforemost by the United Nations Charter, those of peace\r\nand security, still have a very central role in today’s\r\nworld. We welcome the Secretary-General’s emphasis\r\nin his report on the issues of achieving peace and\r\nsecurity. The report reminded us that since last\r\nSeptember numerous internal conflicts have continued\r\nand new wars have broken out. We have seen that the\r\nefforts of the international community, including those\r\nof the United Nations, to bring peace and stability to\r\nthose areas have had rather mixed success and some\r\nshow a distressing tendency to unravel.\r\nAs a country affected by a long-running internal\r\nconflict, we have always been very sensitive to issues\r\nthat involve preventing and resolving conflicts.\r\nTherefore, we are supportive of the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals and approaches, including those contained in\r\nthe report under consideration, seek to prevent\r\nconflicts, stop armed conflicts and keep and build\r\nsustainable peace in the area. We commend in\r\nparticular his initiative in convening the Brahimi panel\r\non United Nations peacekeeping operations and\r\nwelcome his commitment to implement, together with\r\nthe Member States, the panel’s key recommendations.\r\nThe experience of recent years has clearly shown that\r\nthe United Nations capacity to meet an expanding and\r\nan increasingly complex range of peacekeeping\r\ndemands needs significant improvement. Consequently,\r\nthe Department of Peace-keeping Operations also\r\nneeds to be strengthened. We agree therefore with the\r\nSecretary-General that additional resources must be\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nenvisioned in order to allow the United Nations to\r\ncarry out its mandate in the field of peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building.\r\nWith regard to conflict prevention, Moldova\r\nstrongly advocates enhancing the United Nations\r\ncapacity to identify and respond to conflict situations.\r\nWe are pleased to find out that a prevention team has\r\nbeen established to this end within the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs. We hope very much that this new unit\r\nwill pay due attention to all potential conflict areas,\r\nand that the specific situation in the Transdnestr region\r\nof the Republic of Moldova will also be scrutinized\r\nfrom the perspective of conflict prevention.\r\nWe share the view that preventive strategies must\r\nreach all communities that are experiencing\r\nemergencies. The unequal attention given by the\r\ninternational system to certain conflicts or conflict\r\nsituations remains a matter of great concern. We draw\r\nattention to the appeal made recently by the\r\nchairperson of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe to increase the political\r\nawareness of the world community with regard to a\r\nnumber of unresolved or potential conflicts and the\r\nattendant security risks, which often remain outside the\r\nspotlight of broader public attention despite their\r\nhighly destabilizing impact on the region and beyond.\r\nIt is well known that very often it is the newly\r\nindependent States currently undergoing profound\r\neconomic and political transformation that are the\r\nobjects and victims of conflict situations.\r\nThe ardent desire of the peoples of the countries\r\nconcerned is that these conflicts or conflict situations\r\nbe terminated and their root causes eliminated. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report identifies a number of needs\r\nand objectives that, in a sense, provide the necessary\r\nbasis, if implemented, for gradual elimination of the\r\nroot causes of the conflicts I have mentioned.\r\nThe United Nations needs to be refocused and\r\nincrease its effectiveness so as to play a leading role in\r\nshaping this globalizing era. Globalization is a great\r\nhistoric shift offering unparalleled opportunity for huge\r\nadvancements in human development. But, as the\r\nSecretary-General observed, there are risks.\r\nGlobalization creates losers as well as winners. The\r\nchallenge, in our view, is to manage these objects\r\nequitably and sustainably. The United Nations needs to\r\ndo more in providing leadership to drive the\r\ndevelopment agenda and pursue the development\r\ntargets Member States have set.\r\nWe welcome therefore the broadening of the\r\ndialogue between the United Nations and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, focused on strengthening financial\r\narrangements as well as eradicating poverty. Moldova\r\nalso supports the Secretary-General’s efforts to engage\r\nthe United Nations in a regular dialogue with the\r\nprivate sector and civil organizations involved in the\r\ndevelopment process.\r\nMy delegation agrees that the United Nations and\r\nits partners, including global ones, have extraordinary\r\ncapacities in the development field and that it is\r\nimperative to use them effectively in a synergetic way.\r\nIn the final analysis, we consider that all these\r\nnew global partnerships will enhance the capacity of\r\nthe Organization to assist the developing countries, as\r\nwell as countries with economies in transition, to share\r\nin the benefits of globalization. The annual report\r\nbefore the General Assembly today embraces all the\r\nmain areas in which the United Nations is mandated to\r\nconduct its activities. Today we have focused our\r\nstatement on only a few subjects that are, in our view,\r\nparticularly relevant. However, all the subjects brought\r\nto our attention by the Secretary-General are of\r\nimportance, and it is the intention of my delegation to\r\ndevote the same attention to each of them in the course\r\nof this session.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nreiterate its full support for the Secretary-General’s\r\nactivities and for reforming the United Nations and\r\nmaking it more efficient and relevant to the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nMr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\ncomprehensive report of the Secretary-General\r\ncontained in document A/55/1 covers the increasing\r\nactivities of the United Nations in a world undergoing\r\nenormous changes — a fact that underscores the\r\nimportance of the role of the United Nations and the\r\nneed to enhance the Organization and promote its\r\ncredibility and independence. The Secretary-General\r\nhas touched upon many important topics, and it would\r\nbe very difficult to comment on every one of them. We\r\nwill therefore express our position on issues as they\r\ncome up on the agenda. However, there are some\r\nmatters that we feel we must address now. I shall begin\r\nwith the topic of sanctions.\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nFirst of all, we welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nconclusion that doubts regarding the effectiveness of\r\nsanctions have increased in recent years, as well as his\r\nconcern about the negative effects of sanctions on\r\ncivilian populations and on neighbouring countries\r\nwhose trade suffers from sanctions without\r\ncompensation. The Secretary-General calls upon the\r\ninternational community to reflect upon the current\r\nsystem of sanctions and on whether it is in keeping\r\nwith the purposes and principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter, in particular with regard to the comprehensive\r\nsanctions imposed on Iraq.\r\nThose sanctions are now entering their eleventh\r\nyear and are by any measure a form of collective\r\npunishment imposed on the Iraqi people. They have led\r\nto the death of approximately 1.5 million Iraqi citizens,\r\nincluding 500,000 children under the age of five, as has\r\nbeen affirmed by the report of the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund that was published on 12 August 1999.\r\nMoreover, the sanctions have destroyed the social\r\nfabric of the country and are killing approximately\r\n7,000 children every month. On the basis of this data,\r\nthere is absolutely no doubt that those sanctions are\r\nblatantly in violation of the Charter of the United\r\nNations and international humanitarian law. This has\r\nbeen confirmed by United Nations agencies and\r\nhumanitarian and human rights organizations.\r\nFurther proof of the negative effects of the\r\nsanctions against Iraq is provided by the working paper\r\nadopted at Geneva by the Subcommission on the\r\nPromotion and Protection of Human Rights at its fifty-\r\nsecond session, which was held from 31 July to\r\n25 August 2000. That document affirmed that the\r\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq are\r\nillegitimate under international humanitarian law.\r\nDespite increasing calls by the international\r\ncommunity to end this genocide, the United Nations —\r\nwith the support of the United Kingdom — insists on\r\nperpetuating those sanctions as part of its plan to\r\ndestabilize the region, create permanent tension,\r\nimpose its hegemony over the region and rob it of its\r\nwealth. The United States of America has\r\nunequivocally declared its intention to use the veto\r\nagainst any attempt to lift the sanctions imposed\r\nagainst Iraq. Moreover, its Secretary of State has said\r\non a television programme that the death of half a\r\nmillion Iraqi children is an acceptable price for the\r\nongoing sanctions.\r\nConsidering that the Member States of the United\r\nNations have conferred upon the Security Council the\r\nmandate to speak on their behalf, in line with the\r\npurposes and principles of the Organization and\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, and given that the Council\r\nhas gone beyond the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter with regard to the sanctions imposed against\r\nIraq and is thereby providing cover for the application\r\nof genocidal policies against an entire people, the\r\nMember States of the United Nations should express\r\ntheir opinion as to the Council’s adherence to its\r\nmandate. It should also be mentioned that Article 25 of\r\nthe Charter stipulates that the Member States must\r\naccept the resolutions of the Security Council and\r\nimplement them in accordance with the Charter. In\r\nother words, the comprehensive sanctions against\r\nIraq — which are illegitimate under international\r\nhumanitarian law and violate the concept of human\r\nrights — do not represent a Council decision to which\r\nMember States should be committed.\r\nMr. Mungra (Suriname), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMy second point deals with the achievement of\r\npeace and security. The Secretary-General has spoken\r\nabout, and provided examples of, the changes that have\r\ntaken place since the end of the cold war with regard to\r\nthreats to peace and security. We believe that it is\r\nappropriate to focus on a new type of threat, namely,\r\nthat of a single State or States employing armed force\r\nagainst sovereign States in contravention of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. That was the case in the\r\naggression against Yugoslavia and the ongoing\r\naggression against Iraq.\r\nIraq is subjected to daily raids by British and\r\nAmerican planes in the “no flight zone”, which was\r\nimposed by a unilateral decision by the Governments\r\nof Washington and London. Those planes take off from\r\nbases in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey. Those\r\nzones, established in 1991 and 1992, are in no way\r\nlegitimate and have no basis in the relevant resolutions\r\nof the Security Council, a fact that has been confirmed\r\nby the Secretary-General and by numerous countries,\r\nincluding three permanent members of the Council.\r\nThe United Nations is called upon to end this\r\naggression and to bring those responsible for it to\r\naccount.\r\nMy third point refers to humanitarian\r\nintervention. Iraq joins the majority of the Member\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nStates of the United Nations in affirming that the\r\nconcept of humanitarian intervention runs counter to\r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nsuch basic principles of the current international order\r\nas sovereignty, political independence, regional\r\nintegrity and non-intervention in the internal affairs of\r\nStates. The Non-Aligned Movement has declared its\r\nrejection of the concept of humanitarian intervention\r\nand has affirmed that human rights should not be used\r\nas a political tool to intervene in the internal affairs of\r\nStates. The Charter, international conventions on\r\nhuman rights and other relevant international\r\nmechanisms provide the framework for dealing with\r\nviolations of human rights. Those rights should be\r\npromoted, but imposing new ideas such as\r\nhumanitarian intervention in a world where one\r\ndominant Power prevails will not serve the interests of\r\ninternational security but will in fact put international\r\nsecurity at risk. The first victims of that undermined\r\nsecurity will be the countries of the third world.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of\r\nIran): I would like to join previous speakers in\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nand farsighted report on the work of the Organization.\r\nThis report offers the General Assembly a broad\r\npicture of our achievements over the course of the last\r\nyear and of the challenges ahead. Coupled with his\r\ncomplementary statement to the General Assembly, the\r\npresent report is another successful effort on the part of\r\nthe Secretary-General and his colleagues to restore to\r\nthe United Nations its rightful role in pursuit of global\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report shows clearly that\r\nthere is no alternative to strengthening the United\r\nNations as the central mechanism for ensuring peace\r\nand security in the world. The developments that\r\nmarked the reporting period, and the way the\r\ninternational community tried to cope with them, have\r\nconfirmed that there is no other universal tool to ensure\r\nthe joint management of international relations. In this\r\ncontext, the endeavours undertaken by the United\r\nNations in the past year, as described in the report,\r\nalong with the successful holding of the Millennium\r\nSummit, are promising.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General has\r\nhighlighted, among other things, the way the United\r\nNations handles armed conflicts, as well as the role the\r\nOrganization can play in helping control collectively\r\nthe process of globalization. These are among the most\r\nsignificant issues at the top of the international agenda\r\nand, at the same time, command the greatest attention\r\nand concern of the international community.\r\nWhile humanity is undergoing the most radical\r\nchanges ever experienced by humankind, and when\r\nsignificant efforts are needed to direct the course of\r\nevents in a way compatible with the interests of the\r\nmajority of the world population, it is distressing that\r\nlocal conflicts in some parts of the globe, especially in\r\nAfrica, are continuing unabated. In view of these\r\nongoing crises and conflicts that cause enormous\r\nhumanitarian suffering, loss of life and have an adverse\r\nimpact on the socio-economic development of the\r\naffected regions, sustainable peace and security for all\r\ncountries and people remain central objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations, just as they were when the\r\nOrganization was founded over half a century ago.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations are\r\nextremely visible and they therefore come under close\r\nscrutiny by world public opinion. The political weight\r\nof the United Nations is measured by the outside world\r\nmainly by the way it tackles and manages conflict\r\nsituations across the globe. Therefore, it should be\r\nworrisome that, in recent years, United Nations\r\npeacekeeping activities have been criticized for the\r\nlack of uniform standards applied equally to all\r\nregions, for the lack of adequate funding and resources,\r\nfor mismanagement, and for other reasons. In this\r\ncontext, and in view of the reform of the United\r\nNations still on the agenda, there is a pressing need,\r\nand a precious opportunity, to articulate a more\r\neffective and efficient role for the United Nations in\r\nconflict management in the midst of fundamental\r\nchanges on the international scene.\r\nThree major studies commissioned by the\r\nSecretary-General last year have demonstrated that due\r\nattention was being paid to the issue and that the\r\nSecretariat was committed to addressing seriously the\r\ncrux of the matter, with a view to removing the\r\ndeficiencies and to better understanding the needs and\r\nthe potential of peacekeeping operations. In the first\r\ntwo studies, on the circumstances surrounding the\r\ncrimes against humanity in Srebrenica and Rwanda,\r\nefforts have been made to shed light on what went\r\nwrong, including within the Secretariat, and to draw\r\nlessons that could help the smooth running of current\r\nand future peacekeeping operations.\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nIn view of the increasingly complex task faced by\r\npeacekeeping operations as the United Nations seeks to\r\nprevent and resolve conflicts, the third study,\r\nundertaken by a panel of experts established at the\r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General and led skilfully and\r\nably by Ambassador Brahimi, is considered to be an\r\nimportant and useful step in the right direction. We are\r\nconfident that the major overview conducted by the\r\nBrahimi Panel and the recommendations put forward\r\nby it will greatly contribute to ensuring more effective\r\nand efficient peacekeeping operations in the future. In\r\nthe meantime, we believe that the Panel’s report needs\r\nto be thoroughly and constructively considered and\r\ndebated by the Member States in the different bodies of\r\nthe United Nations. While some of the Panel’s\r\nrecommendations relate to matters that are fully within\r\nthe purview of the Secretary General, others will need\r\nthe approval of different bodies of the United Nations.\r\nToday, peacekeeping operations remain an\r\nimportant means for the United Nations to fulfil its\r\nobligations in safeguarding world peace and security.\r\nHowever, given the extent of the challenges and\r\ncomplexity of tasks and responsibilities, there is a need\r\nfor more, better-equipped and trained troops, adequate\r\nresources, the appropriate mandate, preparedness for a\r\nworst-case scenario and coordinated joint action by\r\nMember States and the Secretariat. We believe that we\r\nneed to build on the momentum generated following\r\nthe release of the Panel’s report and to continue to\r\ndebate the pressing issues facing peacekeeping\r\noperations so as to find proper remedies for the current\r\ndeficiencies in this field.\r\nIn the context of conflict resolution, it is worth\r\nrecalling that religion can help greatly to combat the\r\nhatred and persecution that continue to fuel so many\r\nconflicts within and without national borders. Here, I\r\nwould like to echo the Secretary-General’s remark in\r\nhis address to the Millennium World Peace Summit in\r\nNew York, when he invited the religious leaders to\r\nlook within and consider promoting justice, equality,\r\nreconciliation and peace. We believe that the promotion\r\nof this idea can mitigate some of the fundamental\r\nproblems lying at the origin of most conflicts.\r\nAttention paid at the Millennium Summit to the\r\nissues of concern to the world community, especially\r\nthe developing world, such as globalization, poverty\r\neradication, the increasing digital divide, and so forth,\r\nshould be considered a positive development in\r\ninternational relations. Pledges undertaken by the\r\nheads of State and Government from both the\r\ndeveloped and developing worlds are encouraging and\r\nshould be followed up by our Organization.\r\nGlobalization is gaining currency as the\r\nprevailing conceptual framework within which a\r\nconsiderable portion of recent international\r\ndevelopments and interdependencies can be\r\ninterpreted. The real debate is not about whether\r\nglobalization exists and will continue to do so, but\r\nabout how its costs and benefits are distributed.\r\nGlobalization remains potentially a powerful dynamic\r\nforce for growth and development. It can improve the\r\noverall performance of developing countries’\r\neconomies by opening up market opportunities for their\r\nexports, by promoting the transfer of technology and\r\nby increasing the financial resources available for\r\ninvestment.\r\nMaximizing the benefits of globalization requires\r\nthe international community to address the imbalances\r\nand asymmetries in the international economy,\r\nincluding the new economy based on information\r\ntechnology and characterized, inter alia, by the digital\r\ndivide, which if not bridged, will result in a widening\r\nof the gap between the poor and the rich and will\r\nrender many potential changes in the social, economic\r\nand environmental arenas impossible or meaningless. It\r\nis evident that international cooperation is the only way\r\nto harness the power of globalization to a vision of the\r\ngood life for all. Sustainability has little meaning in a\r\nworld marked by poverty and inequality. It is more\r\nthan clear now that, although globalization is a reality,\r\nit is at the same time subject to policy options.\r\nThe eradication of poverty still lies at the heart of\r\nall endeavours for development in the developing\r\nworld and has always been a priority of international\r\ncooperation for development. The fact remains,\r\nhowever, that poverty has not declined in most regions\r\nand in some regions is increasing. As indicated in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General,\r\n“half of the world’s population still must try to\r\nsurvive on less than $2 a day”. (A/55/1,\r\npara. 165)\r\nThe outcomes of major United Nations\r\nconferences and their reviews, particularly the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, have set targets for\r\nthe international community to halve the incidence of\r\npoverty by 2015. The translation of these commitments\r\ninto effective action needs coherence and the\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\ncoordinated efforts of all relevant bodies within the\r\nUnited Nations system, including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, regional bodies, civil society\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and the\r\nprivate sector. It has become clear that aid alone cannot\r\nand will not contribute to poverty eradication; rather,\r\nthe active participation of developing countries in the\r\ninternational economy and their integration into the\r\ninternational financial and trade system through their\r\neffective participation in international decision-making\r\nin these fields and market access are also imperative to\r\nthe success of policies for poverty eradication and their\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe United Nations system has played a major\r\nrole in raising the concerns of developing countries at\r\ninternational forums, designing poverty eradication\r\npolicies in developing countries and disseminating best\r\npractices within the developing world. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is a need to create a vision for future actions of\r\nthe United Nations in the area of poverty eradication\r\nthrough its full participation in global economic policy-\r\nmaking and by strengthening its unique role as a\r\nuniversal Organization for the coordination of social\r\nand economic policies at the international level, in\r\ncooperation with international and regional financial\r\nand trade bodies.\r\nWe have come a long way since we met in 1992\r\nat Rio, where we managed to achieve a convoluted\r\ncompromise and a delicate balance on how to proceed\r\nto protect the environment while maintaining the pace\r\nof growth and at the same time being responsive to the\r\nlegitimate quest of developing countries for sustained\r\neconomic growth in an enabling international\r\nenvironment. The Islamic Republic of Iran is looking\r\nforward to the 10-year review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and its preparatory\r\nprocess and considers the event to be another chance\r\nfor all States to subject themselves to an assessment of\r\ntheir level of compliance with the practical\r\nrequirements of the principles agreed and commitments\r\nmade at Rio with a view to removing the obstacles\r\nimpeding the full implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nOf prime importance to developing countries is\r\nthe pivotal principle of common but differentiated\r\nresponsibilities, which will remain the prevalent spirit\r\ninspiring any further review in which the developing\r\nworld will participate. Iran will continue to offer its\r\nbest affordable contribution to the advancement of\r\nsustainable development — inter alia, through the 10-\r\nyear review process — and will remain committed to\r\nany international endeavour aimed at the dual\r\ncontainment of environmental degradation and poverty.\r\nMs. Durrant (Jamaica): Let me begin by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for the preparation and\r\npresentation of his annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, which offers a very informative and\r\ncomprehensive overview of the various aspects of the\r\nwork of the United Nations. We believe that this report\r\nwill serve as a useful basis for our deliberations\r\nthroughout the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nSince most of the issues raised in the report will\r\nbe addressed under separate agenda items, I will\r\nconfine my remarks to two areas of concern to my\r\ndelegation: increasing the emphasis of the United\r\nNations system on the prevention of armed conflicts\r\nand the safety and security of United Nations and\r\nassociated personnel.\r\nMy delegation supports the clear link made in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report between international peace\r\nand stability and the promotion of sustainable\r\neconomic and social development. In an increasingly\r\nglobalized world, achieving sustainable peace demands\r\nthe increased attention of our Organization. While the\r\nforces of globalization have resulted in extraordinary\r\nimprovements in the lives of many, we have to face the\r\nchallenges presented by this phenomenon, including\r\nthe growing digital divide between the North and the\r\nSouth and increasing levels of poverty and social\r\ninequality, compounded by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nAn effective and timely response to these challenges\r\nwill ultimately constitute a yardstick for assessing the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations.\r\nThe Millennium Summit provided a unique and\r\nhistoric occasion to articulate a common vision for a\r\nUnited Nations of the twenty-first century. Although\r\nremarkable progress has been made, there can be no\r\nquestion that much remains to be done to secure the\r\nuniversal values of liberty and tolerance and the culture\r\nof non-violence to which we aspire. In the face of the\r\ncontinued threats posed by weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and the new scourges of terrorism,\r\ninternational crime and illicit traffic in narcotics and\r\nsmall arms, our collective efforts to promote the ideals\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter must be\r\nmaintained and strengthened.\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nIt is in this context that I turn to the problems of\r\npeacekeeping, peace-building and development. It is\r\nclear that peace operations no longer involve merely\r\nseparating warring parties and monitoring ceasefire\r\nagreements. As noted by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport, they are a far more extensive and complex\r\nundertaking involving disarmament, demobilization of\r\ncombatants, monitoring of human rights, and\r\ninstitutional and legal reforms. We therefore express\r\nour appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nestablishing the Panel on Peace Operations, chaired by\r\nAmbassador Brahimi. We wish to thank the Panel for\r\nits insightful and practical recommendations.\r\nJamaica fully concurs that stronger political and\r\nfinancial support for the Organization, rapid\r\ndeployment standards and improved technical support\r\nfor peace operations are essential. The\r\nrecommendations by the Brahimi Panel deserve serious\r\nand careful consideration, and we hope that they will\r\nbe fully addressed during this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI wish to note the emphasis placed in the Brahimi\r\nreport on the issue of the prevention of armed conflicts,\r\nas my delegation believes that addressing the root\r\ncauses of conflict merits primary attention and\r\nrepresents the most effective approach to achieving\r\nsustainable peace and security.\r\nIn this context, my delegation fully supported the\r\nSecretary-General’s call last year for us to move to a\r\n“culture of prevention”, as we believe that the\r\nprevention of conflicts must be the key focus in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace. The international\r\ncommunity must convert the fruits of the dialogue on\r\nthe prevention of conflict into an effective course of\r\naction for the twenty-first century. A careful\r\nexamination of the root causes of conflict suggests that\r\nthe answers will not be easy to come by. Already\r\nradical initiatives, such as the move in the Security\r\nCouncil to boldly challenge the sinister relationships\r\nbetween armed conflict and illicit trade in diamonds\r\nand other natural resources, point to a new and more\r\nsystematic approach to the prevention of conflict.\r\nDuring Jamaica’s presidency of the Security\r\nCouncil in July 2000, an open debate on the prevention\r\nof armed conflict allowed members and non-members\r\nof the Council to again discuss and identify practical\r\ninitiatives to enhance the role of the Council in the\r\nprevention of conflicts. The presidential statement\r\nissued following the debate underlined the need for an\r\nin-depth consideration of the issue and provided the\r\nmandate for a report which the Secretary-General will\r\npresent in May 2001.\r\nThe other issue which my delegation wishes to\r\naddress at this time is the protection of United Nations\r\nand associated personnel. On 25 September, members\r\nof the staff of the United Nations and members of\r\ndelegations paused for the annual observance of Staff\r\nDay. Regrettably, this provided a sad reminder that\r\nover the past year some 65 peacekeepers and civilian\r\nstaff of the United Nations had lost their lives while\r\ndischarging their duties.\r\nMy delegation is deeply concerned about the\r\ncontinued attacks on humanitarian workers, and we\r\nrecall with deep regret the recent brutal killing of\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees staff\r\nin East Timor. The constant dangers faced by United\r\nNations staff in the field highlight the urgency with\r\nwhich the safety and security of these persons must be\r\naddressed. It is a matter of concern that parties to\r\narmed conflict continue to disregard the rules of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and to place the lives of\r\nour staff in danger. Steps must be taken to prosecute\r\nand bring to justice those responsible for violence\r\nagainst United Nations and associated personnel.\r\nThe international community must, as a priority,\r\nstrengthen international humanitarian and human rights\r\nstandards. The Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel is an important\r\ncontribution to the legal regime for the protection of\r\nhumanitarian workers. With this in mind, Jamaica’s\r\nPrime Minister, during the Millennium Summit,\r\npresented Jamaica’s instrument of accession to this\r\nimportant Convention. We do believe, however, that\r\nthe scope of application of this instrument should be\r\nexpanded to cover locally recruited and other personnel\r\nnot currently covered under the Convention.\r\nThe targeting of humanitarian and peacekeeping\r\npersonnel is unacceptable, and we support the taking of\r\nmeasures to improve staff safety and to provide further\r\ntraining to all personnel engaged in humanitarian and\r\npeacekeeping missions. Every Member State has a\r\nresponsibility to contribute to this process. Without the\r\nstaff of the United Nations prepared to serve in\r\ndangerous situations, the work of the Organization\r\nwould not be taken forward.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nIn conclusion, we commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his outstanding leadership of the\r\nOrganization and thank him for the thought-provoking\r\nideas expressed in his report entitled “Common\r\ndestiny: a new resolve”.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nTanzania commends the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport on the work of the Organization. We applaud his\r\nvision of the Organization, which defines its primary\r\nrole as the promotion of collective action to meet the\r\nchallenges that confront our shared humanity. The\r\nrecently concluded Millennium Summit is a vindication\r\nof this vision. The Summit deliberations and the\r\nDeclaration that was adopted were also a vindication of\r\nthe critical role of the Organization in evolving,\r\ndefining and articulating a global agenda. The\r\nSecretary-General and the Secretariat have had a\r\nsignificant role in that respect. We commend them,\r\neven as we call for a stronger rededication to the\r\nimplementation of the agenda we have set for\r\nourselves.\r\nIt is not our desire to comment on the report in its\r\nentirety. Others have done so, and we share many of\r\nthe concerns raised, in particular those regarding the\r\ndetermination to strengthen worldwide peacekeeping\r\noperations. Our central focus is on Africa. The\r\npromotion of durable peace has to go hand in hand with\r\nthe pursuit of sustained economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. For Africa this is a critical\r\nchallenge. We bank on the United Nations to take the\r\nlead in helping Africa. While we know the challenge is\r\nprimarily ours, international support is critical. This\r\nrequires forging partnerships with the other Member\r\nStates and the international community. Ultimately, an\r\nAfrica that is at peace with itself and self-reliant will\r\nmake significant contributions to world peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn paragraph 231 the report states:\r\n“The breadth and depth of United Nations\r\ninvolvement in Africa is extraordinary”.\r\nThe involvement is a demonstration of the degree of\r\ncommitment to African development. We appreciate\r\nthat Africa has its own share of responsibilities. And\r\nindeed a lot is being done in all spheres.\r\nWhat Africa now needs is concrete commitments\r\nfor a new partnership. We are gratified that the Summit\r\nand the Declaration that it adopted provided a new\r\nhigh-level political commitment to the development of\r\nAfrica. It now behoves the Organization and the\r\nSecretary-General to draw the attention of world public\r\nopinion to the new challenge of helping Africa equip\r\nitself with the tools necessary to compete in the global\r\neconomy.\r\nIt is also for the Organization to further\r\ndemonstrate its commitment to peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa by giving momentum to dealing\r\nwith the issues that impede Africa’s competitiveness.\r\nThe matters to be dealt with include poor resource\r\nflows, access to markets, debt relief, technology\r\ntransfer and fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nOn market access, while Africa is striving to\r\nincrease the production of goods and services, it needs\r\nfree and unhindered access for its products in the\r\ndeveloped countries’ markets.\r\nWe welcome the greater international awareness\r\nof the need to address the debt problem. In this regard,\r\nthe enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative is a welcome move, but more needs to\r\nbe done to enable more countries — especially least\r\ndeveloped countries — to qualify for HIPC funding. In\r\naddition, a comprehensive and durable solution to this\r\nproblem has to be found.\r\nThe Secretary-General raises key questions\r\nconcerning the complexity of preventing and resolving\r\nconflicts. At a time when the Organization is\r\nunderfunded, the complexities become even more\r\ndaunting. But some of the conflicts are only\r\ncomplicated by the Organization’s own sense of\r\nlimitations. It is our view that the even-handed\r\napplication of policies and decisions will go a long way\r\nto instilling confidence in the Organization. Double\r\nstandards should be avoided at all cost.\r\nWe are keenly conscious of the need to protect\r\nthe peacekeepers who are deployed in the field. The\r\nrecent tragedies in Sierra Leone are a grim reminder of\r\nthe risks and dangers confronting peacekeeping\r\noperations. Caution is therefore justifiable. Here I join\r\nthose who have called for strict adherence to the rules\r\ngoverning deployment in situations of conflict. But no\r\ntwo situations can be treated equally. Unlike the\r\noperation in Sierra Leone, all the parties in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo conflict have been\r\ncalling for, indeed urging, the deployment of United\r\nNations forces in the Congo. While caution is justified,\r\nas regards the Congo we appeal for a reassessment of\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nthe decision made. Above all, the people of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo must be reassured\r\nthat this Organization cares, that this Organization can\r\novercome the constraints of its past tragedies in that\r\nterritory in the interest of higher goals: peace, stability\r\nand development for the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and its people.\r\nIn paragraph 153 the Secretary-General refers to\r\nan important undertaking: the reaffirmation of the 1951\r\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees as the\r\nuniversal foundation of refugee protection. There\r\ncannot be a nobler way of celebrating its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. We hope this anniversary will also be an\r\noccasion to evaluate the scope of the refugee\r\nphenomenon. The incidence of resettlement beyond\r\ncamps of refugees who have not taken the option of\r\nacquiring citizenship in the host countries cannot\r\ncontinue to be ignored. For example, while the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\nfigure for refugees in Tanzania is close to half a\r\nmillion, the actual number residing in the country is\r\nclose to a million. We appeal for a holistic approach to\r\nthe refugee problem. To the host country all the\r\nrefugees, whether in camps or with the people, do\r\ncount.\r\nAnd yet, as noted in paragraph 149, we continue\r\nto be one of the countries suffering the spillover effect\r\nof the instabilities in the Great Lakes region of Africa.\r\nThe hospitality of our people is not without bounds. At\r\ntimes such hospitality has been rewarded by outrageous\r\ncharges by the countries of origin. Our tolerance in\r\nsome cases has been tested to the extreme. In\r\nrededicating ourselves to the 1951 Convention, we\r\nmust also dedicate ourselves to a course of action that\r\nwill not only address the root causes, but also redouble\r\npeacemaking efforts that will eventually lead to the\r\nreturn of refugees to their countries of origin. In the\r\nmeantime, I take this opportunity to appeal for more\r\nassistance to refugees as well as to host countries.\r\nIn conclusion, we note that the Secretary-General\r\nidentifies in paragraph 273 the establishment of the\r\nrule of law in international affairs as a central priority.\r\nFor the credibility and legitimacy of the Organization,\r\nreform and expansion of the Security Council are\r\nimperative. The majority of us cannot repeatedly and\r\nwithout consequence call for the expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Council without at some point\r\nbringing into serious question the credibility of the\r\nOrganization as a major advocate of the rule of law.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): My delegation is\r\nhappy that this year, as in the past three years, the\r\nSecretary-General was given the opportunity to\r\nintroduce his report on the work of the Organization at\r\nthe beginning of the general debate. This is a welcome\r\narrangement, which should continue in the future.\r\nMy delegation is particularly happy that this\r\nyear’s report has identified issues that have the\r\npotential of challenging the international community in\r\nthe coming years. My delegation had asked the\r\nSecretary-General to give attention to our suggestion to\r\nthat effect.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report this year is\r\nreadable and presents in a very user-friendly manner a\r\nbroad picture of the various mandated activities of the\r\nworld body. The focus on both substantive issues and\r\nissues relating to institutional reforms is appropriately\r\nbalanced. This draws attention to the fact that both\r\naspects require full and thorough consideration by the\r\nMember States in order for the United Nations to be\r\neffective and efficient.\r\nBangladesh finds it particularly useful that the\r\nSecretary-General offers his own assessment and\r\nsuggests ways in which the international community\r\ncan work together to better the lives of the people still\r\nleft behind. My delegation agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations in many of its peace\r\nmissions is charged with nothing less than helping\r\nrebuild shattered societies almost from scratch.\r\nBangladesh believes that peacekeeping in a\r\nbroader context is an effective tool for conflict\r\nprevention. We strongly believe that peacekeeping\r\noperations should be carried out only under transparent\r\npolitical direction, a precise mandate of the United\r\nNations and an effective command and control\r\nstructure. In this context, we look forward to\r\nexamining the recommendation made in the Brahimi\r\nPanel’s Report (A/55/305).\r\nMy delegation finds it most appropriate that the\r\nSecretary-General argues for a shift from a culture of\r\nreaction to one of prevention. We also believe that this\r\nwill be highly cost-effective both in human and in\r\nfinancial terms. We are encouraged to learn that within\r\nthe United Nations system a prevention team has been\r\nset up by the Department of Political Affairs to watch\r\nover the conflict situations that may require preventive\r\naction.\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nWe welcome the attention that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has given to natural disasters, as well as to\r\nviolent conflicts, as events that pose serious challenges\r\nto the United Nations. His emphasis on the most basic\r\nprinciples of multilateralism and humanitarian ethics is\r\nabsolutely relevant in this context.\r\nThe development mandate of the United Nations\r\nhas special significance for Bangladesh. We are\r\nsatisfied that due attention has been given to this aspect\r\nin the chapter entitled “Cooperating for development”\r\nin the report. My delegation is particularly happy to see\r\nthat in this chapter the Secretary-General has\r\nemphasized the elimination of poverty worldwide and\r\ntermed it the most important development goal of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the section on bridging the digital divide, the\r\nSecretary-General’s observation on narrowing the gap\r\nbetween rich and poor is commendable. We support the\r\nSecretary-General and encourage him to take steps in\r\nnarrowing that digital divide.\r\nBangladesh is pleased that considerable attention\r\nhas been given to accountability and oversight in the\r\nreport. We encourage the continuation of this in the\r\nfuture. The monitoring of the reform process and the\r\nresulting improvements in its operations require the\r\nclose attention of the Member States and should be\r\nreported upon regularly in a transparent manner.\r\nBangladesh welcomes the emphasis given in the\r\nreport on the idea that peace, development and human\r\nrights are interrelated. The international community\r\nhas been alerted to the human rights imperatives of its\r\nactivities and initiatives. We would like the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to devote some space in future reports to cover\r\nthe activities relating to the promotion of the culture of\r\npeace, particularly linking it to the ongoing initiatives\r\nin various parts of the world involving civil society as\r\na whole.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to commend the\r\nSecretary-General again for his well-balanced report.\r\nWe believe that the suggestions and ideas of Member\r\nStates, as articulated in this debate, will continue to be\r\nreflected in future reports of the Secretary-General.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to extend my thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for the comprehensive report he has\r\nsubmitted to us on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/55/1). His report covers a broad and deep range of\r\nproblems facing the United Nations over the last few\r\nyears, and the Secretary-General not only raises\r\nquestions, he also offers us his vision of cooperation\r\nfor the entire international community in order to\r\nimprove the life of those who live on hope alone.\r\nThis important and basic document provides us\r\nwith an additional and useful stimulus to ensure the\r\neffectiveness of the work of this session of the\r\nAssembly, which is taking place following the\r\nMillennium Summit. That Summit was unprecedented\r\nin the level and scope of representation. It was a\r\nmilestone because of its political significance. That\r\ngathering of world leaders not only confirmed that the\r\nUnited Nations will continue to be the main focus for\r\nmanaging international relations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury but also undoubtedly strengthened the role of\r\nthe United Nations and elevated its role to new heights\r\nin the world today.\r\nSince joining the Organization, Tajikistan has\r\ngiven priority to strengthening the stabilizing role of\r\nthe United Nations and has supported its rational\r\nreform so that it will be able to react quickly and\r\nappropriately to what is happening in the world. We\r\nhave supported building up the United Nations\r\npotential to settle crises and conflicts as they emerge.\r\nTogether with all interested States, we will continue to\r\nmake our constructive contribution to strengthening the\r\npotential of this Organization.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that there is\r\nno issue that requires greater attention and more\r\nresources than the attainment of peace and security for\r\nall countries and peoples. The varied, complex crises\r\nthat have faced the United Nations in the last decade\r\nrequire an in-depth analysis of the current mechanisms\r\navailable to the United Nations and reflection on\r\nappropriate ways and means of enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of future peacekeeping operations.\r\nIn this connection, the report prepared under the\r\nleadership of Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi provides,\r\non the basis of an objective analysis of peacekeeping\r\nexperience, realistic assessments and well-thought-out\r\nrecommendations, which we agree with overall. It is\r\nclear that peacekeeping missions will for a long time\r\ncontinue to be one of the main areas of activity of this\r\nOrganization. In some parts of the world, the flames of\r\nnew wars have broken out. New conflicts seem to\r\nemerge from the ashes of the old, and some have gone\r\non for decades without being settled. The pain and\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nsuffering of peoples demand stronger action from the\r\ninternational community to help them.\r\nAdvocating further strengthening of the\r\npeacekeeping potential of the United Nations, we\r\nbelieve that peacekeeping must be based on full respect\r\nfor the  sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\ncountries. It must be timely and appropriate and\r\nfocused on organizing collective action by the\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nWe must not forget that only the Security Council\r\nthat has the exclusive right to authorize on behalf of\r\nthe world community the use of force for the\r\nmaintenance and restoration of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe believe that international law must prevail\r\nwhatever the circumstances of a crisis. The settlement\r\nof the conflict in Tajikistan by political and diplomatic\r\nmeans, under United Nations auspices, provides a very\r\nclear example of the Organization’s great potential to\r\nsettle crises. In our view, it exemplifies what the\r\nSecretary-General has said about the growing\r\nimportance of preventive diplomacy and about the need\r\nto strengthen a culture of conflict prevention. We agree\r\nwith the report’s view that the very nature of conflict\r\nhas changed. The dirty money gained through illicit\r\ntrafficking in weapons and in drugs often fuels conflict.\r\nTajikistan shares the Secretary-General’s concerns and\r\nwill do its utmost to support efforts to combat illegal\r\ndrug cultivation, production, trade and abuse — which\r\nare linked also to terrorism.\r\nIn that context, the regional plan of action\r\nadopted in mid-September by the “six plus two” group,\r\nwith the support of the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme, is of great importance.\r\nOwing to its scope and trans-border character, the drug\r\nthreat from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region is\r\nso serious that no State can counter it alone. We\r\nbelieve that implementation of the plan, with serious\r\nongoing support from the main donors, would make a\r\nreal contribution to enhancing the effectiveness of joint\r\ninternational efforts to counter the growing drug threat.\r\nThe Secretary-General makes this point in his report.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General writes also\r\nabout various aspects of globalization. To varying\r\ndegrees, we are all enjoying the benefits of\r\nglobalization and are suffering from the problems it\r\ncreates. We agree with the report that virtually the\r\nentire developing world is concerned about the\r\nconsequences of globalization. Tajikistan believes that\r\nthe United Nations must do more to promote ways to\r\nnarrow the development gulf between rich and poor\r\nStates. We shall be preparing actively for the High-\r\nlevel Intergovernmental Event on Financing for\r\nDevelopment to be held in 2001, to which the report\r\nmakes reference. We hope that we will be able during\r\nthe preparatory process to move towards resolving\r\nproblems related to the excessive debt burden weighing\r\non developing countries, many of which have recently\r\nexperienced conflicts and devastating natural disasters.\r\nTajikistan welcomes the increasing attention to this\r\nmatter on the part of the Secretary-General, the donor\r\ncommunity and the international financial institutions.\r\nMy Government believes that easing the debt\r\nburden will release internal resources for use in\r\neducation and health care, in dealing with the aftermath\r\nof conflict, in addressing environmental issues and in\r\nreacting effectively to natural disasters.\r\nWe welcome the heightened emphasis on\r\nenvironmental issues. A great deal has been done in\r\nrecent years on those issues, as detailed in the report.\r\nThe vast scope of the problems touched upon in the\r\nreport made it impossible for the Secretary-General to\r\ndeal in detail with one issue of growing importance:\r\nfresh water. Water, obviously, is life, and it will\r\nconstitute one of the main world-wide challenges for\r\nthe twenty-first century. Today, more than a billion\r\npeople lack adequate access to safe drinking water; five\r\nmillion die each year from water-borne diseases. This\r\nproblem arises in all continents. It could be said that\r\nhalf of the world’s water resources have already been\r\nexhausted. Unless a vast effort is made to deal with the\r\nproblem of water, it could become a major source of\r\nconflict. By 2050, it will be impossible to meet the\r\nfresh-water needs of more than half of the world’s\r\npopulation. Only by working together will we be able\r\nto solve this problem. The timing of the second World\r\nWater Forum, held this year at The Hague, was no\r\naccident. Drinking water must be made available to all\r\npeople at a price they can afford. This is among the\r\ngoals of the United Nations; it is a key to resolving\r\nmany issues.\r\nWe shall not now speak of all the matters touched\r\non in the report, but will state our views during the\r\ndebate on individual agenda items.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming our entire support\r\nfor the work of the Secretary-General. Tajikistan firmly\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nbelieves that the United Nations is absolutely essential.\r\nIt has great strength and great potential. We believe\r\nthat joint efforts by the Members of the United Nations\r\nwill further strengthen the Organization and will enable\r\nit to realize that potential. The hopes and aspirations of\r\nthe world’s peoples are focused on the United Nations.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): I should like at the\r\noutset to express my delegation’s appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his insightful report on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/55/1). It is a comprehensive\r\ndocument and provides us with an overall view of the\r\nrole of the United Nations in dealing with the myriad\r\nissues that are of concern and interest to Member\r\nStates, along with proposals for further strengthening\r\nthe Organization’s functioning and improving its\r\nefficiency.\r\nAs the report makes clear, security continues to\r\nbe a concern of the international community, as long-\r\nstanding conflicts persist and new ones erupt, often\r\nexacerbated by ethnic and religious differences and\r\nfuelled by illicit trafficking in arms. These are major\r\nchallenges to international peace and security. There is\r\nthus a clear need to augment global and regional\r\nmechanisms for conflict prevention. In that regard, we\r\nare gratified to note the steps that have already been\r\ntaken and those that are under consideration to prevent\r\narmed conflicts in the future.\r\nPeacekeeping and peacemaking have now become\r\nmore complex and demanding. This led to a major\r\nreview by the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations chaired by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, whose\r\nrecommendations warrant our serious consideration\r\nwith a view to further strengthening those operations.\r\nIn view of the indispensable role of the Organization in\r\nthese activities, it has become imperative to search for\r\nways and means to ensure stable logistical and\r\nfinancial support. All aspects of United Nations\r\nactivities have faced financial constraints in recent\r\nyears, but none have faced such severe constraints as\r\nthe Organization’s peacekeeping missions. It is beyond\r\ndoubt that the current arrangements for financing these\r\nactivities are inadequate and unreliable. They place the\r\nheaviest burden on the developing countries that\r\ncontribute troops, which discourages participation.\r\nIndonesia fully recognizes that implementation of the\r\nPanel’s recommendations will depend to a considerable\r\ndegree on the availability of additional resources and\r\non the resolution of numerous other interrelated issues.\r\nEqually important, peacekeeping operations should be\r\nnon-intrusive and non-interventionist in nature.\r\nThis issue has again been raised in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, which has acknowledged that many\r\nStates have serious and legitimate concerns about\r\nintervention for whatever reasons. Hence, the question\r\nof international intervention continues to be\r\ncontroversial, as it impinges on the critical issue of\r\nforeign intervention and interference in the internal\r\naffairs of States. The recent debates have underscored\r\nhow far we are from reaching a consensus. But those\r\ndeliberations have marked the beginnings of a healthy\r\ndialogue and have focused our attention on providing\r\nthe best care in times of humanitarian emergencies.\r\nFrom Indonesia’s viewpoint, humanitarian assistance\r\ncan only be rendered by the United Nations or any\r\nother organization following a request by the State\r\nconcerned, or at a minimum with its express approval.\r\nTo contemplate otherwise would threaten the very\r\nfoundation of the United Nations, which has always\r\nupheld the sanctity of the sovereign State as essential\r\nto international security and cooperation.\r\nAs a long-time proponent of a regional approach\r\nto disarmament, my delegation is gratified to note that\r\nthe validity of this approach is acknowledged in the\r\nreport. In general, we believe that both global and\r\nregional approaches to disarmament compliment each\r\nother and should be pursued simultaneously.\r\nAs regards other disarmament issues identified in\r\nthe report, the real cause for stalemate is the untenable\r\napproaches adopted by some countries in the post-cold-\r\nwar era. Obviously, if the expectations of the\r\ninternational community are to be fulfilled,\r\nnegotiations must be pursued with the serious political\r\ncommitment of the nuclear-weapon States. Questions\r\nhave constantly been raised as to the commitment of\r\nthose States to fulfil their obligations. The challenge\r\ntoday and in the future is to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of all the provisions of all the Treaties\r\nby all of the States parties.\r\nThe question of illicit traffic in small arms\r\nalluded to in the report has acquired urgency in the\r\npost-cold-war era as civilians have become intentional\r\ntargets. The linkage of children to violence is poignant\r\nand is due largely to the availability of such arms. They\r\nhave placed the safety of societies and the security of\r\nStates in jeopardy. Various initiatives have already\r\nbeen taken at the regional and subregional levels in\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nstemming the illegal flow of small arms. The success\r\nof the forthcoming international conference will\r\ndepend upon resolving a multiplicity of interrelated\r\nissues, including the root causes of conflicts, State\r\ncontrol over security, arms supplies and illicit\r\nactivities, the link of the small arms traffic with drug\r\ntrafficking and terrorism, the reintegration of former\r\ncombatants into unified armed forces and confidence-\r\nbuilding measures.\r\nThe report also touches upon the harmful impact\r\nof sanctions on the civilians of the targeted countries\r\nand neighbouring States whose trade and commercial\r\nrelations are disrupted without compensation and to the\r\ndetriment of their economy. Sanctions are blunt\r\ninstruments and, when imposed indefinitely, have\r\nserved no useful purpose in achieving their objectives.\r\nThey should be subjected to periodic review and\r\nterminated when their objectives are attained. Such an\r\napproach would ensure future support for the\r\nimposition and the implementation of sanctions\r\nregimes. Indonesia considers that the issue of\r\nhumanitarian assistance, either in regard to natural\r\ndisasters or conflict situations, should be considered in\r\na balanced manner. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s view that an international response to the\r\nsituation of internally displaced persons should be\r\ndesigned in collaboration with the Government in each\r\naffected country. Furthermore, it is our view that the\r\ncentral premise of the policy is that the responsibility\r\nfor a humanitarian response lies first and foremost with\r\nthe national Government and that such assistance\r\nshould be based on the request of the Government\r\nconcerned, while fully respecting State sovereignty.\r\nMy delegation would like to underline the\r\nimportant progress that has been made in improving\r\ncoordination within the United Nations system in its\r\nresponse to humanitarian emergencies. The situation in\r\nMozambique earlier this year, which drew an\r\nimmediate response from the General Assembly and\r\nalso the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), is\r\none example of the success that can be achieved\r\nthrough timely action.\r\nIndonesia has always been committed to\r\nstrengthening its national human rights mechanisms\r\nand to effectively promoting and protecting human\r\nrights at all levels. We take note of the new\r\ndevelopments in the work and the mechanisms of\r\nhuman rights bodies, as indicated in the report. In that\r\nregard, we consider it important to note that what is\r\nrequired foremost is to make optimal use of existing\r\nhuman rights bodies by reviewing their procedures\r\nwith a view to avoiding unnecessary overlapping of\r\nactivities.\r\nRegarding social issues, Indonesia agrees with\r\nthe Secretary-General that the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly reached an agreement on sensitive\r\nsocial development issues and resulted in commitments\r\nto social development. In particular, we were\r\nencouraged by the attention that was given to emerging\r\nissues, such as the impact of globalization and the\r\nprospects for the future. In this regard, my delegation\r\nwould like to express its sincere wish that that special\r\nsession does not end as an exercise in rhetoric, but will\r\nhelp restore momentum for social development.\r\nFinally, on the issue of women, Indonesia also\r\nwelcomes the outcome of the Special Session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the Beijing + 5 Review. In\r\nparticular, the prominence that is being given to the\r\nissue of violence against women has strengthened that\r\nprocess. We would note, however, that given the\r\nsignificance that should be attached to the five-year\r\nreviews, it was perhaps too ambitious to hold two\r\nspecial sessions in the same month and same year.\r\nMr. Powles (New Zealand): I would like through\r\nyou, Mr. Acting President, to offer my delegation’s\r\ncongratulations to the new President of our General\r\nAssembly. We look forward to working with him and\r\nhis team, as we enjoyed and appreciated working with\r\nhis respective predecessor.\r\nI would also like to join with those other\r\ndelegations that have expressed their appreciation for\r\nthe Secretary-General’s excellent report contained in\r\ndocument A/55/1. This report contains an eloquent\r\naccount of how the United Nations has confronted\r\nmajor challenges over the past year in pursuing the\r\nobjectives of sustainable peace and security.\r\nIndeed, through our own contributions to United\r\nNations peace operations, and especially through our\r\ncommitment of troops and civilian experts to the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East\r\nTimor, we have some small understanding of the extent\r\nand complexity of the activities being undertaken by\r\nthe United Nations today. It is essential that all of us\r\njoin with the Secretary-General in helping to\r\nstrengthen the Organization’s capacities in this area,\r\nincluding by acting upon the Brahimi Panel’s key\r\nrecommendations.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nThe Secretary-General has noted that many of the\r\nquestions surrounding humanitarian intervention and\r\nnational sovereignty, which he first posed last year,\r\nremain unanswered. Our own impression is that there is\r\nsome polarization among the membership that needs to\r\nbe put aside if the Organization is to move forward. Yet\r\nthe debate raises important issues that warrant careful\r\nreflection, and we believe it is essential to work\r\ntowards a consensus on improved ways of dealing with\r\nsituations in which universally accepted human rights\r\nare being violated on a massive scale. At the same\r\ntime, we see no inherent contradiction between\r\nintervention and national sovereignty in terms of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Article 2, paragraph 7, of the\r\nCharter makes clear that there are circumstances where\r\nMember States do not have exclusive jurisdiction over\r\ntheir domestic affairs, in particular in the case of\r\nmeasures under Chapter VII of the Charter. In other\r\nwords, the Charter provides that measures to preserve\r\ninternational peace and security can override State\r\nsovereignty. National sovereignty is therefore not an\r\nabsolute.\r\nIf there is new ground to be broken in order to\r\nimprove the Organization’s ability to respond more\r\neffectively, it probably lies, in part at least, in the\r\ndomain of the Security Council, which has the task of\r\ndetermining threats to the peace or breaches of it. The\r\nmain impediment, as we see it, to the Security\r\nCouncil’s taking concerted action to try to end massive\r\nhuman rights abuses, including in the recent cases of\r\nRwanda and Kosovo, has been shown to lie in its\r\ndecision-making processes. I refer, of course, to the\r\nveto, by which the will of the wider membership of the\r\nOrganization can be continually frustrated. As we\r\nknow, the veto is omnipresent in negotiations in the\r\nCouncil, even if it is less frequently deployed formally\r\nthese days.\r\nThe Secretary-General refers in his report to\r\ndevelopments in the South Pacific region, where the\r\nUnited Nations has become more involved recently. As\r\none of the contributing countries to the Peace\r\nMonitoring Group in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea,\r\nI want to pay tribute to the very fine work being done\r\nby the United Nations Political Office, which\r\ncomprises just three substantive staff, in helping\r\nfurther the peace process. The Secretary-General also\r\nmakes the point that sustainable peace and prosperity\r\ncan only be assured in Fiji if the aspirations of all the\r\npeoples of Fiji, regardless of race, are taken into\r\naccount and all its citizens can play a meaningful role\r\nin the political and economic life of the country.\r\nFinally, he calls our attention to Solomon Islands,\r\nwhere Australia and New Zealand, working with the\r\nSolomon Islands Government, are helping to lay the\r\nground for peace talks among ethnic factions.\r\nFinally, before leaving peace and security issues,\r\nmay I express our strong support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s observation that future sanctions regimes\r\nshould be designed to maximize pressure on the target\r\nto comply with United Nations resolutions, while\r\nminimizing their effects on the innocent.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his chapter on\r\ndevelopment, deals with many of the issues that\r\nreceived the greatest priority from our Heads of State\r\nand Government during the Millennium Summit. He\r\nrefers, for instance, to the concerns of many countries,\r\nespecially in the developing world, regarding\r\nglobalization. We will be particularly interested to\r\nlearn of any mechanism the Secretary-General has in\r\nmind to enable him to fulfil the comprehensive\r\nresponsibility accorded him by heads of State and\r\nGovernment under paragraph 31 of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nFinally, my delegation is very pleased to see from\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report that important\r\nadministrative reforms, such as results-based-\r\nbudgeting, are being taken up imminently by the\r\nappropriate Main Committee. We hope that there will\r\nbe good progress during this session on some of the\r\nunfinished business remaining from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s 1997 management reform package. We note\r\nwith satisfaction that encouraging progress has indeed\r\nbeen made, in particular in the complex area of human\r\nresources reform. Sustaining meritorious performance\r\nfrom staff and managing them capably are fundamental\r\nto the Organization’s success. We believe this area has\r\nrightly been given top priority by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nMr. Ahmad (Pakistan): On behalf of the Pakistan\r\ndelegation, I would like to express our appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his detailed report\r\non the work of the Organization. We fully agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General that it is time that we translate\r\ninto action the commitments made at the level of heads\r\nof State and Government during the Millennium\r\nSummit. It is in that spirit that the Pakistan delegation\r\nlooks forward to working in partnership with other\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\ndelegations and the Secretariat with a view to\r\nimplementing the decisions of the Summit.\r\nThe two main themes that pervaded the\r\ndiscussion during the Millennium Summit were peace\r\nand security, and development and poverty eradication.\r\nThose themes also form the focus of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. In our view, they constitute the two\r\ncentral challenges to the United Nations in the new\r\nmillennium. Durable peace cannot flourish in the\r\nabsence of sustainable development. Development is\r\nunsustainable in the absence of peace. Peace requires\r\nboth the prevention of conflicts and the resolution of\r\nexisting disputes.\r\nIf we look around us, we can see that new\r\nconflicts have taken root in different parts of the world\r\nwhile many outstanding disputes continue to fester.\r\nThe Secretary-General has called for a shift from what\r\nhe calls a culture of reaction to one of prevention, one\r\nthat is highly cost-effective in both human and\r\nfinancial terms. One can only agree with such an\r\napproach. However, for conflict prevention to be\r\neffective and credible, it must be applied to all\r\nsituations, and root causes must be effectively\r\naddressed. Here, too, commitment must be translated\r\ninto action.\r\nThe Security Council is charged under the\r\nCharter to uphold and strengthen international peace\r\nand security. In fulfilling that mandate, it must act in a\r\nuniform manner, in accordance with the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Charter and its decisions. There must\r\nbe no selectivity. Nor should the Council be used as a\r\nforum to vent narrow prejudices. Otherwise, it will run\r\nthe risk of eroding the confidence of the international\r\ncommunity in the United Nations.\r\nThe Charter also empowers the Secretary-General\r\nto undertake preventive diplomacy through the use of\r\nhis good offices. We would encourage him to continue\r\nto use this authority, with a view to promoting the\r\npeaceful settlement of ongoing disputes and the\r\nprevention of potential conflicts.\r\nThe General Assembly should also give\r\nconsideration not only to the development and\r\nstrengthening of its own role in support of peace and\r\nsecurity but also to the reinforcement of the\r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)\r\nas an impartial mechanism for the pacific settlement of\r\ndisputes.\r\nFor the United Nations to discharge its\r\nresponsibilities, it must have adequate resources\r\navailable to it on a predictable basis. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has to be provided with the tools to effectively\r\nimplement the tasks mandated in the areas of peace-\r\nmaking, peacekeeping, conflict prevention and peace-\r\nbuilding. Here, I would like to express our appreciation\r\nto Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi and members of the high-level\r\nPanel on their report on how to strengthen the United\r\nNations capacity in these vital areas. We look forward\r\nto receiving and discussing the Secretary-General’s\r\nimplementation plan based on the recommendations\r\ncontained in that report.\r\nThe Secretary-General has invited our attention\r\nagain to the “dilemma of intervention”, while\r\nreminding us of the tragedies of Rwanda and\r\nSrebrenica. My delegation had the occasion to\r\ncomment on the concept of humanitarian intervention\r\nin detail during our discussions last year, as well as\r\nduring the discussions on the subject in the Security\r\nCouncil. At the time, we had been calling for a careful\r\nand detailed consideration of the concept. We had also\r\nidentified certain fundamental parameters within which\r\nsuch a concept could have been studied. I will,\r\ntherefore, not repeat them now. Nevertheless, I would\r\nlike to emphasize our willingness to enter into a\r\ndiscussion on this important issue.\r\nThe General Assembly and the Security Council\r\nmust strengthen the international regime established to\r\neffectively prevent crimes against humanity. Countries\r\nthat are guilty of systematic and gross violation of\r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law and\r\nthat bludgeon a people into submission must not go\r\nunpunished. The shameless practice of State terrorism\r\nand brutal repression against a people to prevent them\r\nfrom exercising their inalienable right to self-\r\ndetermination must be brought to an end through\r\nconcerted international action. The perpetrators of\r\nthese crimes must be made to respect the Charter\r\nprinciples and Security Council resolutions and\r\npunished for their refusal to do so. They do not deserve\r\na place in the comity of nations. Article 6 of the\r\nCharter clearly provides for such cases. The display of\r\ndouble standards in this regard by our Organization\r\ntowards identical situations around the world would\r\nonly serve to undermine the authority of the United\r\nNations in the eyes of suppressed peoples.\r\nHere, I specifically refer to the relentless\r\ncampaign of repression against the people in Indian-\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\noccupied Jammu and Kashmir, where we witness the\r\ntrue face of what is called the largest democracy in the\r\nworld revealed as a blatant violator of rather than an\r\nadherent to the immutable principles of democracy that\r\nit so dearly and unabashedly seeks to champion. The\r\ncontinued suppression of the right of self-determination\r\nof the Kashmiri people cannot be obfuscated by India’s\r\nhollow professions of democracy. The United Nations\r\nmust fulfil its promise to the Kashmiri people\r\nconsecrated in the Security Council resolutions. What\r\nis at stake is the credibility and effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations system of dispute resolution and\r\nconflict prevention. Also at stake is peace and security\r\nin South Asia, which today is the most volatile region\r\nin the world. The root cause of all problems afflicting\r\nthis region, with serious implications for global peace\r\nand security, is the unresolved dispute of Jammu and\r\nKashmir. Peace in this region is contingent upon a just\r\nsettlement of this dispute, which concerns the destiny\r\nof 10 million people. It is not a territorial dispute. It is\r\na dispute involving the fate of 10 million people. Also\r\ncontingent upon the early settlement of this\r\nlongstanding dispute is the socio-economic well-being\r\nof one quarter of humanity, which inhabits South Asia.\r\nDevelopment and poverty eradication are equally\r\ndaunting challenges. While we seek to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations capacity in the areas of peace-keeping\r\nand conflict prevention, we must also strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation for the promotion of\r\nsustainable development and the elimination of poverty\r\nworld-wide. As I mentioned earlier, sustainable and\r\nequitable growth are essential for durable peace and\r\nstability.\r\nIt is generally agreed that globalization has not\r\nbeen without its negative consequences. It has widened\r\nthe economic divide between the North and the South\r\nand deepened the gap between the rich and the poor.\r\nThe United Nations, as the most representative and\r\nuniversal body, is uniquely placed to ensure an even\r\nspread of the benefits of globalization to all nations and\r\npeoples.\r\nThe present international financial and trade\r\narchitecture has failed to meet the challenges of\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication. The Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) must reform and adapt themselves to the new\r\nrequirements of sustainable and global growth.\r\nThe fact that the number of people worldwide\r\nliving in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal\r\nof the imbalances and bias in the current global\r\nfinancial and trading system. The 1997 Asian financial\r\ncrisis served to underscore the continuing vulnerability\r\nof countries seeking sustainable development in such a\r\nglobal environment.\r\nOfficial development assistance has progressively\r\ndeclined. On the other hand, the agenda of United\r\nNations specialized agencies is being revised away\r\nfrom the goals of sustainable development and poverty\r\neradication. During the Millennium Summit, all heads\r\nof State and Government agreed to halve the proportion\r\nof people living on $1 a day by 2015. We must now\r\ncome forward with the necessary means and resources\r\nto achieve that goal. The forthcoming high-level event\r\non financing for development will be an important\r\nopportunity for Member States, along with other\r\nrelevant actors and stakeholders, to chart a course for\r\nthe mobilization of adequate resources for\r\ndevelopment, trade, development assistance and debt\r\nrelief.\r\nSustainable development and environmental\r\nprotection are not mutually exclusive. Both require\r\nadequate resources. The commitments made in Rio in\r\n1992 towards resource mobilization have yet to\r\nmaterialize. In their absence, the goal of environmental\r\nprotection will remain elusive.\r\nThe information and communication revolution\r\nhas yielded many new opportunities. At the same time,\r\nit has given rise to the digital divide. It is a gap that\r\nneeds to be bridged if the vast majority of the world’s\r\npeoples are to derive benefits from these new\r\ntechnologies.\r\nThe developing countries continue to be heavily\r\nburdened by external debt — a burden that militates\r\nagainst their efforts to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Some innovative measures need to be\r\ntaken to provide relief to indebted countries. During\r\nthe Millennium Summit, the Chief Executive of\r\nPakistan proposed that resources presently devoted by\r\nindebted countries to debt servicing might be diverted\r\nto social-sector development, focusing particularly on\r\ntheir education, health-care and social welfare\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe challenge of economic development and\r\npoverty eradication is most acute in Africa, coupled\r\nwith simmering conflicts in that region. The\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\ninternational community needs to give special attention\r\nto the economic and security situation obtaining in that\r\ncontinent. Similarly, the special needs of small island\r\ndeveloping States and of landlocked countries require\r\nspecial attention and responses.\r\nThe Secretary-General has called for a Global\r\nCompact to meet the challenges of development and\r\nenvironmental protection through the observance of\r\n“good practices” by the private sector based on shared\r\nvalues among the broader international community. We\r\nare fully conscious of and recognize the need to engage\r\nthe private sector in partnerships. However, for the\r\nCompact to succeed, it is essential that it enjoy the\r\ntrust and confidence of Member States.\r\nTo meet the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, the United Nations must undergo a change in\r\norder to reflect the universal character of the\r\nOrganization. This is particularly true in the case of the\r\nSecurity Council, which needs to be made more\r\ndemocratic, representative, transparent and effective.\r\nAn effort is being made to create the perception\r\nthat the majority of the membership favours the\r\nrealization by a few States of their great power\r\nambitions. In reality, it is the reverse. During the\r\nMillennium Summit and the general debate, we\r\nrepeatedly heard calls from this very podium for the\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council and not for the\r\ncreation of new centres of power and privilege, which\r\nwould aggravate the existing imbalances. The reform\r\nprocess will not be complete unless the working\r\nmethods and decision-making of the Security Council\r\nare brought into conformity with the principle of\r\nsovereign equality.\r\nWe must rise to meet the tasks mandated to us by\r\nour heads of State and Government. We must\r\neffectively respond to the challenges that confront us.\r\nIt is only through a reinvigorated and adequately\r\nequipped United Nations that we can hope to\r\ncollectively realize our shared objectives.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): My delegation wishes\r\nto express its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his\r\nthoughtful report on the work of the Organization,\r\nwhich we are considering today. The report covers a\r\ncomprehensive range of issues. We are pleased with the\r\nbroad coverage and careful treatment of many critical\r\nissues in the report. On many of these issues, we share\r\nthe concerns of the Secretary-General and we make our\r\nown his appeal for the speedy consideration and\r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe Brahimi report on United Nations peace operations.\r\nThe Namibian delegation is pleased that, in\r\naddition to the more traditional areas of United Nations\r\nconcern, such as international peace and security,\r\nhumanitarian activities, development cooperation and\r\nhuman rights, the report addresses other important\r\nissues, including the bridging of the digital divide,\r\nHIV/AIDS, social development, the advancement of\r\nwomen, poverty eradication and development finance.\r\nIn this intervention, I will limit myself to four\r\nissues highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report that\r\nare of particular importance to my delegation.\r\nFirst, we agree with the Secretary-General that\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic is a serious development\r\nissue. In addition, we believe that the AIDS pandemic\r\nrepresents a real threat to peace and security on the\r\nAfrican continent, as was agreed during a recent\r\nhistoric Security Council debate on the impact of this\r\ndreaded disease on the security situation of the affected\r\nAfrican countries. Many startling statistics are\r\navailable to describe the real situation on the ground.\r\nIn view of the fact that next week we will debate\r\nthe issue of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and in view of\r\nthe forthcoming special session of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to make only a few preliminary\r\ncomments. Given the magnitude of the pandemic, I\r\nthink it is only proper that the General Assembly\r\naddress and urgently adopt concrete action to tackle\r\nthis scourge. It is long overdue for this body to deal\r\nwith the matter and set the exact dates for the special\r\nsession. It is also important that the preparatory process\r\nand the special session should be inclusive.\r\nMy delegation strongly believes that adequate\r\nfunding should be provided to both the preparatory\r\nprocess and the special session itself. This requires\r\nstrong political commitment from all Member States,\r\nand I believe that commitment may have to be\r\ndemonstrated in the Fifth Committee soon.\r\nSecondly, development and poverty eradication\r\nare issues of tremendous importance to the United\r\nNations and all individual countries. My delegation\r\nappreciates the succinct presentation of this subject in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report in the context of\r\nglobalization and other challenges facing the\r\ndeveloping countries. Namibia maintains that there is\r\nan urgent need to review and redesign the basic\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nparadigm of globalization itself. We look forward to an\r\nearly opportunity to discuss this matter further.\r\nFor now, we would like to stress that\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication should be\r\naddressed in the context of the commitments made by\r\nour heads of State or Government in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. In addition, the Namibian delegation\r\nwould want to see a closer link established henceforth\r\nbetween the commitments of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the upcoming High-level Event on\r\nFinancing for Development.\r\nNamibia will participate actively in preparations\r\nfor this important international event, which must fully\r\ntake into account the needs of all developing countries.\r\nFurthermore, this event will be an occasion to take a\r\nfresh look at the recommendations and commitments of\r\nall the major United Nations conferences of the past\r\ndecade. Representatives are aware that many worthy\r\nrecommendations emanating from those conferences\r\nremain unimplemented for want of resources. All of\r\nthese considerations must provide a relevant point of\r\ndeparture for the work of the Preparatory Committee of\r\nthe High-level Event on Financing for Development.\r\nInternational peace and security remain elusive,\r\nespecially on the African continent. In this respect, we\r\ncould not agree more with the Secretary-General on the\r\nissues and problems he raises on this subject in the\r\nsection of his report dealing with peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building. In this connection, my delegation joins\r\nothers that have spoken before it in calling for the early\r\nconsideration of the Brahimi report. We also urge the\r\nspeedy implementation of many core recommendations\r\ncontained in that report.\r\nNamibia also shares the concerns of the\r\nSecretary-General expressed in paragraphs 31 through\r\n37 of the report under consideration. However, as the\r\nForeign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\nstated before the Assembly during the general debate,\r\n“Namibia remains unconvinced and will continue\r\nto oppose any form of unilateral humanitarian\r\nintervention outside the Charter”. (A/55/PV.24)\r\nWe believe that the provisions of the Charter\r\nprovide an adequate framework to deal with the types\r\nof problems contemplated in paragraph 37 of the report\r\nunder consideration. Furthermore, we note the\r\ninitiative of Canada for the establishment of an\r\nindependent commission on humanitarian intervention.\r\nHowever, we maintain that the General Assembly itself\r\nshould remain seized of this issue until a satisfactory\r\noutcome is reached.\r\nLastly, I would like to draw the attention of\r\nrepresentatives to paragraph 30 of the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration, in which the heads of State or\r\nGovernment reaffirmed the centrality of the General\r\nAssembly and called for it to play that role effectively.\r\nIn that context, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNamibia made some practical proposals to assist in this\r\nmatter. We would be pleased to see any initiatives that\r\nthe General Assembly may want to take in respect of\r\nconsidering those proposals.\r\nMy delegation is ready to participate in any\r\ndiscussion relating to this and other matters raised\r\nearlier. We also stand ready to cooperate fully with the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to continue\r\nsupporting him in his endeavours.\r\nMr. Stuart (Australia): One of the worthwhile\r\nresults of the Millennium Summit is that the\r\nDeclaration has given us an agenda to work on. This\r\nfeatures a number of goals for tasks that ought to be\r\nquite central to the way the United Nations develops as\r\nan Organization in this new century. Some of these\r\ngoals have been put in the form of simply stated\r\ntargets, including a common resolution that by the year\r\n2015 we shall halve the proportion of the world’s\r\npeople whose daily income is less than one dollar;\r\nachieve universal primary-school education; and\r\nreduce the rate of maternal mortality by three quarters.\r\nMy delegation accepts the inclusion of such\r\ntargets as a readily understood way of encapsulating\r\nwhat we, the Member States, agree to be core\r\nchallenges for the United Nations of promoting\r\ndevelopment, poverty alleviation and individual\r\nwelfare. The utility of these targets is both as\r\nbenchmarks against which we can measure the results\r\nof the collective effort of United Nations Member\r\nStates to cooperate in these areas, and as a succinct,\r\nunequivocal message of our intentions and priorities.\r\nThe elimination of poverty is an aspect of the\r\nUnited Nations work which features in Chapter III of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. Indeed, the Secretary-General presents it\r\nas the most important development goal of the United\r\nNations. Based on the  estimate in the report of the\r\nnumber of people trying to survive on less than a dollar\r\na day, our Millennium Summit target will require a\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nchange from 1.2 billion people living on or below that\r\nlevel to 600 million people. This is a daunting\r\nfigure — but we should not be deterred, as experience,\r\nfor example, in several East Asian countries has shown\r\nthat strong economic growth over a generation can\r\nhave a major impact on poverty levels. Nonetheless,\r\nsetting such a target does beg the question, just what\r\nshould the United Nations do to help realize this\r\nchange?\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report recognizes the\r\nimportance of translating commitments into effective\r\naction. My delegation certainly agrees with its\r\nobservations that “the promotion of sustainable and\r\nequitable growth” is the most important means for\r\nmaking progress towards the poverty target, and that\r\nthis is tied to open markets and stable legal and\r\nregulatory institutions to facilitate the operation of\r\nsuch markets. Overall, however, the relevant section of\r\nthe report is rather thin on specific suggestions for\r\naction.\r\nAccordingly, my delegation believes that one of\r\nthe tasks we should set for ourselves in this session of\r\nthe General Assembly is to identify what more the\r\nUnited Nations could do to promote the levels of\r\neconomic growth that could generate such a significant\r\nfall in levels of poverty, including by considering how\r\nto encourage the removal of constraints to growth in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThese constraints are both external and internal.\r\nExternally, we should address the need for an\r\nequitable, rules-based, non-discriminatory system for\r\ninternational trade and financing. Increased and fairer\r\naccess to markets, and a removal of the distortions to\r\ninternational trade that flow from continuing trade\r\nbarriers and export subsidies, would be a major\r\nimpetus to the kind of growth levels needed to\r\napproach the Summit target. Broad-based multilateral\r\nnegotiations have proven the best way of delivering a\r\nmore equitable, open and predictable trading\r\nenvironment, and for this reason Australia has been a\r\nstrong advocate for the early launch of a new, market-\r\naccess-focused round of multilateral trade negotiations.\r\nSuch a round is needed not only to further trade\r\nliberalization but also to ensure that there is no going\r\nback on existing commitments. In particular, it is\r\nimportant that negotiations produce the conditions in\r\nwhich developing countries benefit more equitably\r\nfrom increased trade and overall growth of the world\r\neconomy. For this to happen, market openings must be\r\navailable in areas where developing countries have\r\nexport potential and the capacity to supply\r\ncompetitively. And with this in mind, it is vital that\r\nagricultural trade be put on a more equitable footing.\r\nAccording to the annual report of the\r\nOrganization for Cooperation and Development\r\n(OECD) on agricultural policies, total agricultural\r\nsupport in OECD countries reached $361 billion in\r\n1999. That is seven times as much as the development\r\nassistance OECD countries provided to developing\r\ncountries. Farm protection has returned to levels not\r\nseen for more than a decade. In particular, export\r\nsubsidies for agriculture are the most pernicious and\r\ntrade-distorting of all forms of support, which is\r\nprecisely why they have not been permitted for\r\nindustrial exports for 40 years.\r\nOne of the most significant of the internal\r\nconstraints to growth which we suggest the Assembly\r\naddress is the impact that national policies and\r\ninstitutions have on development. This was recognized\r\nduring the recently concluded General Assembly\r\nsession in the resolution adopted on globalization,\r\nwhich resolution underlined the importance of\r\n“governance responsive to the needs of the people\r\nbased on efficient, participatory, transparent and\r\naccountable public service, policy-making\r\nprocesses and administration”. (resolution\r\n54/231, para. 10)\r\nRespect for the role, and the rights, of individuals and\r\nof families is also an essential concomitant of a\r\nflourishing market-based economy. We believe that\r\nwhile the United Nations and its agencies have a role to\r\nplay in helping to strengthen good governance as an\r\nelement of sustainable and equitable development,\r\nthere is also no substitute for action by Governments.\r\nAnother aspect of fostering economic\r\ndevelopment mentioned in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport is financing. In considering how to implement\r\nour Summit goals, next year’s high-level event on\r\nfinancing for development is an important element.\r\nAustralia will continue to contribute actively and\r\nconstructively to the preparatory work for this event.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report describes some of\r\nthe work done over the last 12 months in the United\r\nNations system in considering the relationship between\r\nglobalization and the eradication of poverty. Some\r\nworthwhile ideas have emerged from meetings between\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and from discussions within the\r\nCouncil. For the most part, these discussions have\r\nreflected a realistic appreciation of the role and\r\nlimitations of the United Nations and other multilateral\r\norganizations. Yet we still hear the occasional\r\nargument that indicates that the United Nations can in\r\nsome way roll back the tide of global change. It cannot.\r\nRather its role should be to help its Member States\r\nidentify and address both the challenges and\r\nopportunities of globalization. Simplistic formulas\r\nlinking these changes with poverty or inequality will\r\nnot take us far — and they may well be misleading, as\r\nin the past 10 years the proportion of the world’s\r\npopulation living in extreme poverty has, according to\r\none reliable measure, in fact fallen from 28 to 24 per\r\ncent.\r\nWhat is important in the globalization debate in\r\nthis General Assembly is to focus on action where the\r\nUnited Nations can make a difference. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report notes that “steady progress” is being\r\nmade in improving the coherence and effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations operational performance. My\r\ndelegation sees this as a much more fruitful area for\r\ncooperation than pursuing quixotic and unworkable\r\nproposals for international taxes. In particular, while\r\nencouraged by the experience to date of the United\r\nNations Development Assistance Framework, we\r\nwould like to see this model for coordination of\r\ncountry programmes among United Nations agencies\r\nbecome a standard approach. We also strongly support\r\nthe move within the United Nations funds and\r\nprogrammes towards results-based budgeting. This\r\nincreased focus on achieving and demonstrating results\r\nwill not only attract greater funding, but will also\r\nensure that those funds are best used to support the\r\ngoals in the Summit Declaration.\r\nThe above will, I hope, give delegations a good\r\nsense of Australia’s views of some areas warranting\r\nattention in pursuing the agenda set out in the\r\nMillennium Summit. Other priorities for us on issues\r\nrelating to development and humanitarian assistance\r\nwill include the following. One of these priorities is\r\nseeing how we can step up international efforts to stop\r\nand ultimately reverse the spread of the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic. We would also like to boost early\r\npreparations for the ten-year follow-up conference to\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, as we would like to see the groundwork\r\nlaid for a worthy follow-up to the Rio conference. We\r\nalso wish for consideration of oceans-related issues to\r\nprogress. This would include consolidating the very\r\nsuccessful inaugural meeting of the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea and addressing some pressing\r\nissues relating to fishing practices through resolutions\r\nof the General Assembly. My delegation is also\r\ninterested in touching on water security, including the\r\nproposal, which Australia supports, for an international\r\nyear of freshwater, and practical means of pursuing\r\nsuch elements of the Millennium Summit as the target\r\nof halving the proportion of people with no access to\r\nsafe drinking water.\r\nI have concentrated much of my attention today\r\nto issues of poverty alleviation, an issue that Australia\r\nbelieves is very much a core issue for the United\r\nNations system. To conclude, however, I would like to\r\noffer some more general comments on how the\r\nMillennium Summit might inform our work at this\r\nsession.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report is, as usual, a\r\nuseful survey of United Nations activities. And as\r\nusual it covers a very wide range of activities carried\r\nout by the United Nations system. The Summit has,\r\nhowever, given us an exceptional opportunity to give\r\nmore impetus and focus to the work of the\r\nOrganization. The impetus derives from the\r\nextraordinary attendance at the Summit of the great\r\nmajority of national leaders. The focus can be drawn\r\nfrom the Summit Declaration, which has given us a\r\nroad map for our work within the United Nations and\r\nhas given us guidance on priorities. This latter element\r\nis fundamental. The United Nations cannot do\r\neverything. Now we have made progress on\r\nestablishing those areas where the United Nations does\r\nhave an indispensable role, it is up to delegations to\r\nmake sure that the resources and efforts of the\r\nOrganization are geared to achieving them.\r\nNaturally my delegation’s priorities include a\r\nnumber of areas I have not mentioned. Some are\r\nreflected in the statements made by the Australian\r\nPrime Minister and the Foreign Minister at the Summit\r\nand in the general debate respectively. We share the\r\nstrong interest that many have expressed here in\r\npractical reforms, including to update the composition\r\nof the Security Council, reconfigure the electoral\r\ngroups and increase the United Nations peacekeeping\r\ncapacity along the lines of the recommendations in the\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nBrahimi report. We will again be pursuing vigorously\r\nwork in the areas of disarmament, and a number of\r\naspects covered in chapter IV of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report — the chapter on “The international\r\nlegal order and human rights”.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to working with the\r\ndelegations of other Member States in an effort to give\r\npractical effect to the goals set out in the Summit\r\nDeclaration. We are conscious that we are not starting\r\nfrom scratch. There is a considerable foundation of\r\nachievements, programmes and operations on which\r\nwe can build. We do not need to reinvent the wheel, but\r\nwe should be prepared to try doing things differently so\r\nthat the United Nations responds to contemporary\r\nchallenges as effectively as possible.\r\nMs. Enkhtsetseg (Mongolia): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to express my Government’s appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his annual report (A/55/1),\r\nwhich covers broad aspects of the Organization’s work\r\ncarried out in the past 12 months. The report contains\r\nmany useful ideas and proposals aimed at further\r\npromoting the Organization’s work in specific fields.\r\nMy delegation would like to assure the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that Mongolia will cooperate with\r\nthe Secretary-General and fellow Member States to\r\nmake this Organization stronger and more efficient in\r\npursuit of the noble goals and principles enshrined in\r\nits Charter.\r\nWith regard to enhancing the role of the United\r\nNations, my delegation would like to underline the\r\nimportance of the recent United Nations Millennium\r\nSummit and its outcome. The Millennium Declaration\r\nadopted at the Summit not only reiterated the\r\ncommitment of the international community to the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter,\r\nbut it also reaffirmed its readiness to reshape the\r\nactivities of the Organization in the spirit of the\r\nevolution that characterizes today’s world. As the\r\nSecretary-General has rightly pointed out in his report,\r\nit is now time, at this session of the General Assembly,\r\nfor us to roll up our sleeves and start putting into action\r\nthe bold pledges made during the Summit, pledges that\r\nare challenging yet nevertheless achievable.\r\nSince consideration of this agenda item should\r\nnot be a second general debate, I would limit my\r\nstatement to the following points.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration world leaders have\r\nsolemnly reaffirmed that\r\n“the United Nations is the indispensable common\r\nhouse of the entire human family, through which\r\nwe will seek to realize our universal aspirations\r\nfor peace, cooperation and development”.\r\nImplementation of the Millennium Declaration\r\nimplies pursuing further the reform of the United\r\nNations, including restoration of the General\r\nAssembly’s important role as envisaged in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, reforming the Security Council,\r\nenhancing the role of the Economic and Social Council\r\nand better coordination of United Nations activities\r\nwith international financial institutions.\r\nReform of the United Nations is a continuing\r\nprocess. It is well under way and is yielding results in\r\nsome areas. However, the effort to reform the Security\r\nCouncil has not brought us closer to resolving one of\r\nthe main issues: expansion of the Council to reflect\r\npresent-day realities and to increase its effectiveness.\r\nWe believe that the expansion of the Security Council\r\nshould be made in both categories, permanent and non-\r\npermanent. A reasonable increase in the number of\r\nnon-permanent seats should reflect the representative\r\ncharacter of the Council and enable a growing number\r\nof Member States, including small States, to contribute\r\nto its work. The reform of the Council should also deal\r\nwith the right of veto, which should be considerably\r\ncurtailed.\r\nAs is seen in the Secretary-General’s report, in\r\nrecent years the demands for the peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building roles of the Organization have increased\r\nmanifold. The lessons of Srebrenica, Rwanda and\r\nSierra Leone made it abundantly clear that a thorough\r\nand critical review is needed to make peacekeeping\r\noperations succeed in meeting commitments under the\r\nCharter.\r\nIn this connection, the Mongolian delegation\r\ncommends the work of the Panel on United Nations\r\nPeace Operations, chaired by Ambassador Brahimi.\r\nThe Panel’s report (A/55/305) presents a frank analysis\r\nof the prevailing situation and a forthright\r\nrecommendation for change. We share the view that the\r\nreport deserves serious consideration and specific\r\naction even at this session of the General Assembly.\r\nWith a view to increasing its direct contribution to\r\npeacekeeping operations of the United Nations, last\r\nyear Mongolia signed a memorandum of understanding\r\nwith the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.\r\nToday, Mongolia has trained personnel ready to\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nparticipate in peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, a\r\nspecial unit of Mongolia’s armed forces has recently\r\nsuccessfully participated in the United Nations-\r\nsupported regional peacekeeping training exercise in\r\nCentral Asia.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations should be\r\njudged in part by the role that the Organization could\r\nplay in promoting developmental goals of its Members,\r\nespecially of the small, vulnerable and least developed,\r\nand in overcoming and reducing poverty. In today’s\r\nglobalizing world this role is acquiring greater\r\nimportance. In this connection, my delegation\r\ncommends the positive role that the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is\r\nplaying in articulating the problems of landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries, countries that due to their\r\ngeographical location cannot compete fairly with\r\nothers and that are forced to spend two to three times\r\nmore to get access to world markets, thus losing\r\nwhatever competitive edge they could have had\r\notherwise.\r\nImplementation of the decisions of the tenth\r\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment could help this group of countries tackle\r\nsome of the difficulties mentioned above. My\r\ndelegation hopes that the upcoming trilateral and\r\nministerial meetings on the problems of landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries will have a practical impact on\r\nreducing the enormous obstacles facing their\r\ndevelopment. Likewise, we also attach great\r\nimportance to the forthcoming high-level conference\r\non financing for development.\r\nTurning briefly to the questions of security and\r\ndisarmament, my delegation would like to express its\r\nsupport for the proposal of the Secretary-General to\r\nconvene a major international conference aimed at\r\nidentifying ways of eliminating nuclear dangers. We\r\nhope that this timely proposal will be given serious\r\nconsideration at this session of the General Assembly.\r\nMongolia also believes that pending the\r\nconclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty, the\r\nUnited Nations could establish a register for all stocks\r\nof weapons-grade fissile material. This would also help\r\nestablish an important balance with the United Nations\r\nRegister of Conventional Arms.\r\nAll States, big and small alike, are expected to\r\ncontribute to promoting and attaining the goals\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Guided\r\nby that spirit, Mongolia is trying to turn its vast\r\nterritory into a nuclear-weapon-free area. To this end,\r\nand in implementation of General Assembly resolution\r\n53/77 D, it has undertaken a series of consultations\r\nwith the five nuclear-weapon States on\r\ninstitutionalizing this status. As a result of these\r\nconsultations, it is expected that the five permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council will soon make a\r\njoint statement providing nuclear security assurances to\r\nMongolia in connection with that status. This would be\r\na concrete step in institutionalizing the status. We\r\nbelieve that strengthening other aspects of Mongolia’s\r\nexternal security would make the status more credible\r\nand effective. A transparent, credible and stable\r\nsecurity regime relating to Mongolia’s status would be\r\nour contribution to the international efforts of\r\npromoting regional peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to underline once again\r\nMongolia’s resolve to contribute actively to the work\r\nof the Organization in pursuit of its noble goals and\r\nobjectives.\r\nMr. Sun Joun-yung (Republic of Korea): I would\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive and insightful report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/55/1). The Millennium Summit held in\r\nthis very Hall only three weeks ago was a historic\r\nevent. It provided a rare opportunity for more than 170\r\nworld leaders to reach consensus on guiding principles\r\nto address daunting challenges in the new century. Now\r\nit is our responsibility to translate the summit\r\nDeclaration into action.\r\nI would also like to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued\r\ninterest in developments on the Korean peninsula. We\r\ntake note of paragraph 58 of the report, in which the\r\nSecretary-General made reference to the Korean\r\npeninsula. We also share his view that a historic\r\nopportunity is unfolding on the Korean peninsula to\r\nresolve decades-old conflicts between South Korea and\r\nNorth Korea and thus to contribute to peace and\r\nstability in the region and beyond. I take this\r\nopportunity to express my Government’s deep\r\nappreciation for the statement issued by the Co-\r\nChairpersons of the Millennium Summit welcoming the\r\ninter-Korean summit and its follow-up measures (press\r\nrelease GA/SM/194, 6 September 2000).\r\nWe have recently witnessed a resurgence of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in the face of\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\never-increasing challenges around the globe, in\r\nparticular in East Timor, the Balkans and Africa. The\r\nnumber of United Nations peacekeepers in the field has\r\ntripled, and United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nseem to continue to be on the rise. The complexity of\r\nrecent crisis situations requires peacekeeping\r\noperations to expand their scope beyond the traditional\r\nrealm of peacekeeping. My delegation shares the view\r\nof the Secretary-General that peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding have become inseparably linked.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the report (A/55/305)\r\nof the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations\r\nchaired by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, which we believe will\r\nbe an important basis for deliberations aimed at making\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations more effective\r\nand adequate in addressing future challenges. While\r\nreserving detailed comments for future occasions, I\r\nwould like to make a few remarks with regard to the\r\nBrahimi report. In implementing many of the\r\nrecommendations of the report, we should bear in mind\r\ntheir budgetary implications, among other things. We\r\nare of the view that the decision-making process of the\r\nSecurity Council should be more transparent. Countries\r\ncontributing with troops or other important means\r\nshould be given the opportunity, in one way or another,\r\nto participate in the decision-making process of the\r\nCouncil. In this context, briefings by the Secretariat\r\nshould be made available outside the Security Council\r\nto contributing Member States, not only on matters\r\naffecting the security and safety of their own\r\npersonnel, but also on all other matters related to\r\npeacekeeping operations. By doing that, we will be\r\nable to make peacekeeping operations more successful\r\nin the long run.\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly that the\r\nRepublic of Korea, which has joined the peacekeeping\r\nforce in East Timor, will remain firmly committed to\r\nthe cause and the activities of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in the future.\r\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, information\r\ntechnology has facilitated the process of globalization.\r\nWe all know that globalization presents tremendous\r\npotential for economic growth and poverty eradication.\r\nWe should not underestimate its positive impact in\r\nterms of integrating the peoples of the world. However,\r\nmore attention needs to be paid to mounting concerns\r\nover undesirable consequences of globalization, in\r\nparticular in developing countries.\r\nThe United Nations certainly continues to take\r\nthe lead in building a “digital bridge” enabling\r\ndeveloping countries to join the information-\r\ntechnology revolution. My Government attaches\r\nparticular importance to education in information and\r\ncommunication technologies, so it has provided\r\ndeveloping countries with information-technology\r\ntraining programmes; it plans to expand those\r\nprogrammes in the future. We believe that the United\r\nNations should do more to provide developing\r\ncountries with training of that nature. More concerted\r\naction is required at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels to bridge the digital divide.\r\nFurthermore, it has become clear that genuine\r\npartnership with major development stakeholders, such\r\nas the Bretton Woods institutions and the private\r\nsector, is increasingly vital. In that context, my\r\ndelegation supports the creative initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General on a global compact, proposed last\r\nyear, and recent developments in that regard.\r\nLet me now turn to the successful outcome of the\r\ntwo special sessions to review and appraise the\r\nimplementation of, respectively, the commitments\r\nmade at the Copenhagen World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and at the Beijing Fourth World\r\nConference on Women towards the realization of a\r\n“society for all” in the new millennium. At those\r\nsessions, we all reaffirmed our commitment to put\r\npeople at the centre of development. For development\r\nto be sustainable, it must be carried out with genuine\r\nrespect for democracy and human rights. In that regard,\r\nmy delegation welcomes the resolution adopted by the\r\nCommission on Human Rights last April on the role of\r\ngood governance in the promotion of human rights. My\r\ndelegation agrees with the Secretary-General that that\r\ngroundbreaking resolution links good governance with\r\nan environment conducive to the enjoyment of human\r\nrights and the promotion of human-centred\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOne of the most fundamental challenges this\r\nOrganization faces is how to be more responsive to the\r\nneeds of the world public. I believe that broad-based\r\nsupport for the United Nations depends on timely and\r\neffective communication and on result-oriented\r\nactivities. In that regard, the United Nations has made\r\nconsiderable achievements in strengthening public\r\noutreach and in enhancing administrative efficiency.\r\nHowever, more work must be done to make better use\r\nof the Organization’s resources and funds.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate the commitment\r\nof the Republic of Korea to the strengthening of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly. We believe that, under\r\nthe able leadership of Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, the\r\nfifty-fifth session, following the historic Millennium\r\nSummit, will prove to be the most productive one ever.\r\nMr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the thoughts set out in\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization (A/55/1),\r\nwhich, together with his millennium report\r\n(A/54/2000), will contribute to identifying the\r\nproblems facing the international community as it\r\nenters the new millennium and in offering solutions to\r\nthose problems.\r\nUnfortunately, over this past year new conflicts\r\nhave broken out. Wars, extreme poverty, natural and\r\nman-made disasters and the AIDS pandemic symbolize\r\nthe suffering being endured.\r\nThe linkage between peace and poverty is\r\nbecoming increasingly clear. As the Secretary-General\r\npoints out to us, there is a visible link between thriving\r\nmarkets and human security, which requires, we\r\nbelieve, an approach based on greater solidarity that\r\nwill provide the system with resources and will also\r\npromote a just and lasting development for all human\r\nbeings. In addressing the Millennium Summit, the\r\nPresident of Argentina focused precisely on this issue.\r\nWe still have not given thought to the challenge\r\nthe Secretary-General put before us last year about the\r\nlimits to sovereignty and the need to respond to serious\r\nand massive human rights violations. The principle of\r\nnon-intervention is fundamental to relations among\r\nStates that are equal and sovereign. However, at the\r\nsame time, Argentina believes a principle that would\r\ncomplement non-intervention must be added: the\r\nprinciple of non-indifference. This principle means,\r\namong other things, that those responsible for aberrant\r\ncrimes cannot enjoy impunity and that we must\r\nactively pursue ways and means to prevent their\r\noccurrence.\r\nTherefore, we welcome the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court and the tribunals for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone,\r\nconvinced that their formidable deterrent power\r\nconstitutes real, important and defined progress of the\r\nUnited Nations towards peace, national reconciliation\r\nand justice.\r\nWe must increase the protection of the civilian\r\npopulation affected by conflicts. The recommendations\r\ncontained in the report submitted to the Security\r\nCouncil last September continue to be fully valid and\r\nthe resolutions adopted by the Council represent\r\nimportant strides in that direction.\r\nUnited Nations officials and humanitarian\r\npersonnel continue to experience very serious attacks.\r\nWe pay our tribute to those who recently lost their\r\nlives. Argentina is very active in this arena, and when\r\nwe presided over the Security Council last February,\r\nwe organized an open debate on this matter. We look\r\nforward with interest to the proposals that the\r\nSecretary-General will make on the scope of\r\napplication of the 1994 Convention on the Safety of\r\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel. We call\r\nupon those countries that receive this report to sign and\r\nratify its text and for the international community to\r\nfirmly confront this problem.\r\nWith regard to Security Council reform, my\r\ncountry believes that the reform must be wide-ranging\r\nand comprise all its aspects in order to make it more\r\ndemocratic, transparent and effective. My country\r\nbelieves that expansion of the membership must be\r\nmade only by non-permanent members in order not to\r\ncreate new privileges in addition to those already in\r\nexistence.\r\nThe consensus-achieving body required for that\r\nreform to be legitimate must be, in our view, the Open-\r\nended Working Group that is open to all members of\r\nthis Organization.\r\nThe reception by Member States of the Brahimi\r\nreport demonstrates the broadly shared recognition of\r\nthe importance of peacekeeping operations, the\r\nshortcomings of the system and the need to adopt\r\nurgent measures to revitalize it.\r\nThis moment in political life must be seized to\r\nadvance towards the implementation of its\r\nrecommendations. Success of the implementation of\r\nthe Brahimi report is rooted in the will of Members\r\nStates, which, on one hand, should be translated into\r\nthe decision to provide the Organization the necessary\r\nhuman and financial resources, and, secondly, to\r\nassume risks inherent in peacekeeping missions.\r\nWithout the genuine commitment of its members, the\r\nUnited Nations will not be able to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nThe report is a valuable contribution to\r\nmaximizing the system. We urge States to analyse their\r\nrecommendations in the General Assembly, as well as\r\nin the Security Council, and to not delay the\r\nimplementation of measures that, without doubt, will\r\nstrengthen United Nations peacekeeping capacity.\r\nThis year’s report also reflects the effort of the\r\nUnited Nations to alleviate the multifaceted aspects of\r\nhumanitarian emergencies that are exacerbated by the\r\ndevastating dimensions of natural disasters and the\r\nterrible suffering of civil populations and humanitarian\r\npersonnel in countless conflicts.\r\nThis report demonstrates that United Nations\r\naction system-wide is being impeded by financial and\r\npolitical limitations. In the financial realm, the decline\r\nin contributions in response to inter-agency\r\nconsolidated appeals is alarming. In the political realm,\r\nthe inadequate capacity and readiness to cooperate with\r\nthe affected authorities or clashing groups is\r\nconcerning.\r\nAs a non-permanent Security Council member,\r\nArgentina has been closely following the unfolding of a\r\nvast number of humanitarian emergencies, examining\r\nthe situation of refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons. We support the tireless work carried out by the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), Mrs. Ogata, who, with her energy and\r\ncreativity, has stepped up the work of her office to\r\nreach increasingly more individuals.\r\nWe must stop and think even more about the\r\ninternally displaced persons that live in extreme\r\nconditions, often lacking assistance and protection. We\r\nmust support the States that are going through these\r\nprocesses, particularly the most extreme cases, so they\r\ncan provide these citizens with assistance and basic\r\nsocial services as long as they are displaced and so that\r\nthey can create conditions for their safe and dignified\r\nreturn.\r\nWe must emphasize that actions being taken by\r\nthe United Nations and its subsidiary bodies must be\r\nfocused on individuals and on protecting and defending\r\nthe values and the property of individuals affected by\r\ncrises and conflicts.\r\nThe United Nations has contributed to broadening\r\nthe agenda of issues now being discussed at\r\ninternational forums, especially the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions. Greater interaction between the United\r\nNations, the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund is central to discussing new strategies\r\nthat will factor in the dichotomy seen in various\r\ndeveloping countries between globalization and\r\npoverty eradication.\r\nBringing Governments together with actors of\r\ncivil society strengthens the capability for\r\ndevelopment. We highlight here the “Global Compact”\r\ninitiative, which links corporations, trade unions and\r\ncivil organizations with the daily work of the United\r\nNations system as a way of complementing\r\nGovernments’ actions and generating certainty for the\r\nbusiness sector in those countries that require the\r\ncapital flows and investment for their economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nWe must also point to the creation of a volunteer\r\ncorps to assist those countries that are most isolated\r\nfrom information technology and to work to integrate\r\nthe most backward areas into the global information\r\nhighway.\r\nWhile the Secretary-General has identified the\r\ndrop in official development aid as one of the main\r\nobstacles to be overcome in fighting poverty, he has\r\nalso called upon the States themselves to become\r\ninvolved, ensuring good governance, responsible\r\npublic administration and the state of law.\r\nWe must implement the policies, programmes and\r\nprojects recommended as a result of the review\r\nprocesses relating to the world summits on women and\r\non social development. Argentina has taken upon itself\r\nthe relevant commitments, and is promoting the\r\nadoption of specific policies to deal with poverty, the\r\nelderly, pregnant and nursing mothers and their\r\nchildren and those infected with the HIV virus or who\r\nare sick with AIDS.\r\nWe welcome the resolution on good governance\r\nadopted by the Commission on Human Rights. This is\r\nan issue of particular interest to our country because it\r\ngoes to the very heart of the social compact between\r\nthose governing and the governed, the nature of\r\ndemocracy and the real existence of a state of law. A\r\ntransparent government that does account for what it\r\ndoes is a guarantee for respect for human rights.\r\nWe also hail the appointment of special\r\nrapporteurs for housing and food, as well as of the\r\nspecial representative for human rights defenders.\r\nThese competencies extended to the special rapporteurs\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nfurther the advancement and protection of all human\r\nrights, both civil and political, as well as economic,\r\nsocial and cultural.\r\nUnfortunately, these rights are still being\r\ntrampled upon. There has been a further increase in sex\r\ntrafficking and the economic exploitation of women\r\nand children. We see continuing discrimination against\r\nmigrants and indigenous peoples, and racist and\r\nxenophobic acts. There is, however, a series of major\r\ninitiatives under way, such as the Permanent Forum on\r\nIndigenous Issues recently created by the Economic\r\nand Social Council, the upcoming World Conference\r\nagainst Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia\r\nand Related Intolerance, the Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women and the Optional\r\nProtocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nWe hope that these steps will lead to an ever-clearer\r\nawareness in the international community as to the\r\nneed to put an end to these human rights violations and\r\nto prosecute and punish those responsible, thus\r\ncontributing to a more just and peaceful world.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): In the\r\nreport under consideration, for which we are deeply\r\nobliged to the Secretary-General, we see a fact\r\nconfirmed, one of which we were all aware to some\r\nextent: the fact that, whenever the United Nations\r\nfailed in its efforts to secure or to keep the peace and to\r\nprevent massive human rights violations, this occurred\r\nneither for lack of means nor for any structural flaws\r\ninherent in the Organization, but rather because of\r\ndeficiencies or shortcomings in the human management\r\nof the instruments available to the international\r\ncommunity to respond to such crises.\r\nIn paragraph 7 of his report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral lists the causes behind those failures. The\r\nnature of those failures necessarily determines the\r\nnature of the means to remedy them. Lack of political\r\nwill can be remedied only where there is political will.\r\nLack of resources can be remedied only by providing\r\nresources. Inappropriate mandates can be remedied\r\nonly with appropriate ones.\r\nThat is why our delegation understands that what\r\nthe Secretary-General calls “the dilemma of\r\nintervention” must be resolved not by resorting to\r\nunilateral intervention on the part of States or groups of\r\nStates acting outside the United Nations, but rather by\r\ncorrecting errors that have frustrated effective action\r\nby the international community in the face of tragedies\r\nsuch as those of Srebrenica and Rwanda. We are\r\nentirely in agreement with the Secretary-General that\r\nwe are talking about a problem of responsibility. In all\r\ncircumstances in which massive human rights\r\nviolations occur, we, the international community, are\r\nobliged to shoulder our responsibilities and to act\r\naccordingly. But that responsibility must be made\r\neffective through the United Nations, created precisely\r\nto act on behalf of all of us through collective action\r\nthat is legitimate because it emanates from bodies that\r\nrepresent the entire international community.\r\nIn the past, interventions, even the well-\r\nintentioned ones, used to end up pursuing goals\r\nunrelated to humanitarian causes. Humanitarian\r\nintervention, designed to put an end to a situation\r\nwhere juridical norms and basic morality were being\r\nignored, can itself end up being the root of situations of\r\nthis kind, thus generating more problems than it solves.\r\nCollective action executed in consonance with the\r\nnorms enshrined in the Charter has replaced and\r\ndisplaced unilateral interventions.\r\nFor these reasons, and without prejudice to the\r\nfact that in extreme cases dictated by actual\r\ndevelopments we might be able to conceive of the\r\npossibility of resorting to humanitarian intervention,\r\nthere must be no attempt to institutionalize it; nor must\r\nit be recognized as a suitable instrument to put an end\r\nto the perpetration of international crimes.\r\nAs regards peacekeeping operations, the report of\r\nthe Panel of experts chaired by Ambassador Brahimi,\r\ncould not have come at a better time. It provides an in-\r\ndepth examination of these operations, revealing their\r\ninsufficiencies and shortcomings. We must proceed as\r\nsoon as possible to consider its recommendations so\r\nthat we can translate immediately into reality those that\r\nappear to be appropriate. We are looking forward to the\r\nplan for implementing these recommendations, which\r\nthe Secretary-General promised us at the opening of\r\nthis session’s general debate. Moreover, we hope that it\r\ntakes into account other valuable reports on the issue\r\nthat have recently been produced.\r\nNever is it superfluous to stress the importance of\r\nthe preventive aspects of the job of ensuring\r\ninternational peace and security. We have read with the\r\nkeenest interest the information provided to us by the\r\nSecretary-General on measures adopted in the last few\r\nyears to strengthen information and coordination\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nmachinery linking our Organization to other\r\ninternational organizations, Member States and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. We believe that it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to strengthen the United Nations\r\ninformation and analytical services so that we can\r\nenable them to alert the Secretariat and other bodies of\r\nour Organization to situations that may erupt into crisis\r\nor conflict. The point is to raise these services to a\r\nlevel of high professionalism so that they can gather,\r\nanalyse and interpret information in a way that would\r\nmake it possible to foresee the emergence of trends and\r\ndiscern possible threats to peace and security and to\r\nwarn of the imminence or possibility of domestic\r\nupheaval, institutional crises, human rights violations,\r\nborder incidents and so forth. The Secretary-General\r\nhas told us about the establishment of a prevention\r\nteam in the Department of Political Affairs, and this\r\nmarks an important step in that direction.\r\nAnother avenue to be explored is that of United\r\nNations cooperation with regional organizations. My\r\ndelegation realizes that we still have not made much\r\nprogress in this arena. As the Secretary-General puts it,\r\ncooperation with some regional organizations has, in\r\nsome instances, proved fruitful; but the effort for\r\ncooperation continues to be difficult in this arena,\r\nowing to a series of practical, political and\r\norganizational factors.\r\nOur country is convinced that regional\r\norganizations of a political nature, such as the\r\nOrganization of American States and the Organization\r\nof African Unity, carry an enormous potential that in\r\nsome cases could be mined and made available for\r\nconflict prevention or peacekeeping operations. The\r\nregional organizations afford certain specific\r\nadvantages. They are usually seen by Governments in\r\nany given region as more their own, and the\r\nassumption is that they are more familiar with the\r\nrealities and problems of their member countries. It is\r\nto be hoped that tangible progress will be made along\r\nthese lines at the high-level meeting announced by the\r\nSecretary-General between the United Nations and the\r\nregional organizations.\r\nThe institutional instruments that we rely on to do\r\nthe task of ensuring international peace and security\r\nmust be adapted to take a multidimensional and\r\nintegrated approach, which the nature of contemporary\r\nproblems requires. The Secretary-General rightly\r\npoints out the growing complexity of peacekeeping\r\noperations, which require the performance of new\r\nfunctions and the use of civilian personnel trained in a\r\nbroad range of disciplines. States’ cooperation in this\r\narena is becoming more necessary than ever. Uruguay\r\nwould like to express its readiness to cooperate with\r\nthe Secretariat and other bodies of our Organization in\r\ndealing with this issue.\r\nWhenever we speak of international peace and\r\nsecurity, we are ultimately referring to the peace and\r\nsecurity of every society, every family and every\r\nindividual. In the final analysis, the end goal and\r\npurpose of our cooperation activities is the human\r\nbeing — every living being within the society in which\r\nwe live. From this truth flows the need to base\r\ncooperation on the concept of human security. As the\r\nSecretary-General reminds us in his report, human\r\nsecurity and economic development go hand in hand.\r\nThe enormous job of promoting economic\r\ndevelopment must now be pursued in the context of\r\nglobalization. It has already been pointed out that this\r\nphenomenon has two sides to it: on the one hand it\r\ngenerates prosperity, and on the other it accentuates the\r\ngap between the developed and the developing world.\r\nWhile it is true that globalization is an inevitable\r\nphenomenon and that trying to oppose it would be like\r\ntrying to oppose the law of gravity, it is nevertheless\r\ncontrollable and can be oriented and managed. The\r\nmanagement of globalization to ensure that its benefits\r\nare distributed more equitably among all societies of\r\nthe world must be undertaken on the basis of certain\r\nfundamental principles relating, inter alia, to\r\ninternational trade, the movement of capital, the\r\nregulation of work and environmental protection.\r\nAs a result, we cannot but agree with the\r\nSecretary-General when he asserts that, in order for\r\nglobalization to be made more inclusive and equitable,\r\nwe must create more effective global institutions.\r\nAmong other things, we must adopt norms and\r\nmeasures to ensure that freedom of trade works in\r\nevery direction for the benefit of all States, not only of\r\nthose that, because of their greater economic\r\ndevelopment, are better equipped to compete.\r\nFinally, I wish briefly to refer to an issue whose\r\nimportance is growing day by day: that of information\r\nand communications technologies. The report stresses\r\nthe need to enhance cooperation in this field so as to\r\nensure the access of all to those new technologies. My\r\ndelegation congratulates the Secretary-General on his\r\ninitiatives to reduce the digital divide and encourages\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nthe Secretariat and all components of the United\r\nNations system to persevere towards that end.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation\r\nwould like to commend the Secretary-General for\r\nproducing yet another excellent document in his report\r\non the work of the Organization. This report builds on\r\nthe foundation laid in the Secretary-General’s\r\nmillennium report, which was well received and\r\nendorsed by the heads of State and Government who\r\ncame to New York for the Millennium Summit. We\r\nappreciate the high level of reporting that the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff have continued to\r\nprovide to members of this Assembly. We believe that\r\nthese reports give direction on how we could improve\r\nor even change course, in order to make the United\r\nNations of the twenty-first century a more effective and\r\nefficient Organization.\r\nThe heads of State and Government who spoke at\r\nthe Millennium Summit emphasized several important\r\npoints. They reconfirmed their support for and\r\nconfidence in the work of the Secretary-General and\r\nhis staff. They said that it is time for us to roll up our\r\nsleeves and to start implementing the resolutions that\r\nwe have adopted over the years. The Summit left us\r\nwith the spirit of the millennium, which calls on us to\r\nproceed with a sense of urgency and not at the pace of\r\ndoing business as usual.\r\nWhile the Summit focused a spotlight on many\r\nissues, in the view of our delegation the overriding\r\ntheme that emerged in the plenary speeches and round-\r\ntable debates was the urgent need to address poverty\r\nand underdevelopment. While reaffirming the role of\r\nthe United Nations in maintaining peace and security in\r\nthe world, the heads of State and Government\r\nacknowledged the difficulty of maintaining global\r\nsecurity in a world crippled by hunger, disease and\r\nabject poverty.\r\nIn fact, my delegation believes that, following the\r\nMillennium Summit, it is no longer possible to address\r\nquestions of peace and security, globalization, poverty\r\neradication and the like in isolation from each other.\r\nThe work of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury will have to be about getting closer to the lives\r\nof the people we serve. There can no longer be\r\ndecisions taken that are not people-centred in their\r\napproach.\r\nPresident Mbeki said it better in his plenary\r\nspeech when he stated that\r\n“The fundamental challenge that faces this\r\nMillennium Summit is that, in a credible way, we\r\nmust demonstrate the will to end poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment ... We must demonstrate the\r\nwill to succeed, such as was demonstrated by\r\nthose who died in the titanic struggle against\r\nNazism and fascism.” (A/55/PV.5)\r\nThe Africans have defined the broad objectives of\r\nthe African renaissance. First, we have concluded that\r\nthe African renaissance means the establishment of\r\ndemocratic political systems, which will ensure the\r\naccomplishment of the goal that the people must\r\ngovern. Second, the renaissance will make certain that\r\nthese systems take into account African specifics so\r\nthat, while being truly democratic and protecting\r\nhuman rights, they are nevertheless designed in ways\r\nwhich really ensure that political and peaceful means\r\ncan be used to address the competing interests of\r\ndifferent social groups in each country. Third, it will\r\nestablish institutions and procedures which enable the\r\ncontinent to deal collectively with questions of\r\ndemocracy, peace and stability. Fourth, it will seek to\r\nachieve sustainable development that results in the\r\ncontinuous improvement of the standard of living and\r\nthe quality of life of the masses of people. Fifth, it will\r\nqualitatively change Africa’s place in the global\r\neconomy so that it is free of the yoke of the\r\ninternational debt burden and no longer a mere supplier\r\nof raw materials and an importer of manufactured\r\ngoods. Sixth, it will ensure the full emancipation of the\r\nwomen of Africa. Seven, it will successfully confront\r\nthe scourge of infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS,\r\ntuberculosis and malaria. Last, the renaissance is about\r\nprotecting the environment of our continent and\r\nensuring the sustainable use of our natural resources.\r\nWe are very much aware that the African\r\nrenaissance is not an event, but a process. We have no\r\nillusions about the immense difficulties we face in\r\nmeeting the challenges listed above. We will make\r\nprogress, but we are also prepared for setbacks. Like\r\nthe United Nations of the twenty-first century, our\r\nchallenge is to tackle the priorities with a sense of\r\nurgency and not just to act as if we were engaged in\r\nbusiness as usual.\r\nMy delegation firmly believes that, throughout\r\nthe fifty-fifth session, which we prefer to call the\r\nMillennium Assembly, poverty and underdevelopment\r\nwill remain the root causes of most of the issues which\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\ncome before us. This unshakeable reality will guide our\r\ndelegation’s participation throughout this session.\r\nOne of the things that has sharpened the\r\ninequalities between and within States is the\r\nphenomenon of globalization. We must accept that\r\nglobalization is here to stay. It is indeed a reality. The\r\nonly way to make globalization a positive force for all\r\nis to deal with its uneven impact. In April, the\r\ndeveloping countries attending the South Summit in\r\nHavana, Cuba, spoke on the impact of globalization,\r\nincluding the growing “digital divide”. This concern\r\nbecame one of the issues central to the dialogue\r\nbetween the South, represented by President Mbeki,\r\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, President\r\nObasanjo, Chairman of the Group of 77 and China, and\r\nPresident Bouteflika, representing the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU); and the leaders of the Group of\r\nEight industrialized countries, whose Summit was held\r\nin Japan.\r\nThey stressed that:\r\n“The countries of the South must be equitably\r\nrepresented in any forum deliberating and\r\ndeciding on social, economic or political matters\r\nwhich can adversely or otherwise affect\r\ncountries of the South.”\r\nIn other words, if we are to put an end to the growing\r\ndisparities between the developing and developed\r\ncountries, there has to be a strengthening of the North-\r\nSouth dialogue. Hence we welcome the channels of\r\ncommunication that have now been established at the\r\nhighest level between the North and the South through\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nwith the Group of Eight industrialized countries and\r\nthe European Union.\r\nIn the pursuit of poverty eradication and\r\ndevelopment, our delegation fully supports the\r\nenhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative, and we look forward to speeding up its\r\nimplementation. A critical element of this Initiative is\r\nthe need for more resources to be made available at a\r\nfast pace. We believe, however, that ways need to be\r\nexplored to further broaden the scope and enhance the\r\ndepth of debt relief. In our view, it is equally important\r\nto make serious progress on the issue of official\r\ndevelopment assistance and foreign direct investment\r\nflows.\r\nIn this context, South Africa places a high\r\npriority on the successful outcome of the High-level\r\nInternational Intergovernmental Event on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in 2001. This conference\r\ncould become a test of our collective political will to\r\nmake decisions that will improve the lives of those who\r\nsuffer the most. It should nevertheless be understood\r\nthat developed countries carry a special responsibility\r\nin this regard.\r\nOne of the cornerstones of our objective in\r\nstruggling for socio-economic development,\r\ndemocratization and good governance is to achieve\r\nsecurity and stability on the continent. This cannot be\r\naccomplished without combating the proliferation and\r\nthe excessive accumulation of conventional arms, in\r\nparticular small arms and light weapons, and their\r\nillicit trafficking.\r\nWe welcome the Millennium Declaration, which\r\naddressed both the proliferation of small arms and the\r\nneed to totally ban landmines and other anti-personnel\r\nmines, which continue to take the lives of innocent\r\npeople in our country. We hope that the 2001\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects will offer the\r\ninternational community yet another opportunity to\r\nreaffirm its commitment on this issue in a multifaceted\r\nmanner that takes account of security, humanitarian\r\nand development issues.\r\nOnce again, we welcome the report of the United\r\nNations Panel on Peace Operations, also known as the\r\nBrahimi report, which contains some important\r\nconclusions on which Member States can build to reach\r\nthe objective of an effective United Nations.\r\nMy delegation deplores the continuing wave of\r\nattacks on, and killings of, humanitarian personnel. We\r\nsupport efforts to improve protection for such\r\npersonnel and the need to prosecute the perpetrators of\r\nthese crimes.\r\nA separate but related topic is the important\r\nmatter of humanitarian intervention. My delegation\r\nseriously hopes that this issue will be discussed during\r\nthis session.\r\nSouth Africa has in the past consistently called\r\nfor the democratization of multilateral institutions. Our\r\ndelegation sincerely hopes that the Millennium Summit\r\nwill inject new energy and political will into this\r\nprocess. The Security Council needs urgent reform in\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\norder to make it more representative, effective and\r\ncredible. Of particular importance to our delegation is\r\nthe need for the Council to reflect current realities and\r\nfor the representation of developing countries to be\r\nincreased. We shall continue to work constructively in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on Council reform to\r\nachieve these objectives.\r\nWe should like to reiterate that the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions are equally in need of urgent reform in\r\norder to discharge their mandate and respond to the\r\nnew development challenges. We believe that the\r\nUnited Nations of the twenty-first century will have a\r\nmuch harder time meeting the challenges before us if\r\nwe cannot find a way to bring the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization into a\r\ncloser working relationship with the United Nations.\r\nThe challenges of the future demand collective action\r\nand coordination.\r\nPerhaps one of the more contentious issues on the\r\nagenda of this session is the proposed review of the\r\nUnited Nations scale of assessments. It is our intention\r\nto approach this matter with an open mind, always\r\nmaking sure that the best interests of the United\r\nNations are not compromised. South Africa looks\r\nforward to being moved from category B to category C\r\non the peacekeeping scale of assessments during this\r\nfifty-fifth session. We are thankful to those Members\r\nthat have committed themselves to helping us achieve\r\nthis goal. We count on the support of the rest of the\r\nMember States in this matter.\r\nIt gives us great pleasure to reaffirm today that\r\nour Government would be honoured to host the 2002\r\nEarth Summit in South Africa. We believe that the 10-\r\nyear review Summit should reinvigorate the global\r\ncommunity’s support for sustainable development by\r\nserving the interests of both developing and developed\r\ncountries. The Summit should focus in a holistic\r\nmanner on the integration of environment and\r\ndevelopment towards the full implementation of\r\nAgenda 21. Hosting the Summit on the African\r\ncontinent would provide the people of Africa with an\r\nopportunity to take ownership of the principles of\r\nAgenda 21 and the objectives and ideals of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Furthermore, it would enhance the\r\nconcept of the African century and give impetus to the\r\nAfrican renaissance by highlighting Africa’s concerns\r\nand aspirations related to sustainable development.\r\nSince 1994, when South Africa was readmitted to\r\nthe United Nations, we have worked very hard to\r\nmaintain support for, and the dignity of, this\r\nOrganization. So it is with a deep sense of our recent\r\nhistory as a nation that South Africa is in the process of\r\narranging for the hosting of the World Conference on\r\nRacism and Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance less than a year from now. Having\r\nsuffered under the cruel system of apartheid, my\r\npeople, both black and white, feel very strongly about\r\nthis Conference and look forward to sharing their\r\nvision of the future. We look forward to receiving\r\neveryone with the warmth and kindness that our\r\ncontinent is well-known for.\r\nMr. Nesho (Albania): First, I would like to\r\nextend our greetings to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his comprehensive report on the work of the\r\nOrganization and to express the deep appreciation of\r\nmy Government for the activities undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations since the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI should like now to refer to particular aspects of\r\nthe report. I take this opportunity to touch upon the role\r\nof the United Nations in the peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding operations in Kosovo, eloquently described in\r\nthe Brahimi report. The Albanian Government has\r\nwelcomed and supported the work of the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\r\n(UNMIK) as well as the role of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Bernard\r\nKouchner. We consider that UNMIK has brought about\r\npositive changes in Kosovo in the areas of\r\nadministration, humanitarian assistance and the\r\nbuilding of democratic institutions. This activity was\r\nconducted in full compliance with Security Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999). I also applaud the important\r\nwork of the international military presence, the Kosovo\r\nForce, and of the civilian police in Kosovo, which has\r\nprovided a safe and secure environment for the people\r\nof Kosovo and for the international civil presence\r\nthere.\r\nWe extend our thanks to the specialized agencies\r\nof the United Nations — the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund, the World Food Programme and so\r\nforth — for their invaluable work and the assistance\r\ngiven during the emergency, not only to Kosovo, but\r\nalso to the neighbouring countries. At the same time, it\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nis important that these United Nations bodies increase\r\ntheir efforts and cooperation with the international\r\ncommunity to establish normal living conditions to\r\nprepare for the return of more than 200,000 refugees\r\npresently living in other European countries.\r\nFurthermore, the worrisome situation in the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and\r\nMontenegro) and the potential influx of refugees\r\nrequires that these humanitarian agencies prepare\r\nemergency plans to deal with the possible humanitarian\r\nconsequences.\r\nRegarding the continuing inter-ethnic violence in\r\nKosovo — referred to in paragraph 145 of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, where the Kosovar\r\nAlbanians are assigned the primary responsibility for\r\nthis violence — I would like to make the following\r\nremarks. The Albanian Government has stated that it\r\nsupports a multi-ethnic society in Kosovo and has\r\ncondemned the acts of violence. However, we should\r\nnot forget that the roots of such violence are to be\r\nfound in the Serb genocide and “ethnic-cleansing”\r\ncommitted against the Kosovar Albanians. This\r\ngenocide was characterized by the killings of thousands\r\nof Albanians, horrendous massacres, mass graves,\r\n“ethnic-cleansing” and burned houses. The Kosovar\r\nAlbanians want a peaceful and democratic Kosovo,\r\nwhile the Milosevic regime is always trying to\r\ndestabilize the situation by generating violence inside\r\nKosovo and jeopardizing the UNMIK objectives.\r\nWe hope that the recent presidential and\r\nparliamentarian elections in the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) will bring to an\r\nend the criminal Milosevic regime and open up new\r\nways of cooperation and understanding among the\r\nBalkan countries.\r\nMs. Ibraimova (Kyrgyzstan): The delegation of\r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic is grateful to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his very comprehensive, thoughtful and\r\ninformative report. It gives us a good overview of the\r\nwork of our Organization. Reading the report, I was\r\nthinking that the Member States of our Organization\r\nhave achieved a great deal in laying the foundations for\r\nthe further development of our common world. Of\r\ncourse, much remains to be done, and this report\r\npresents for consideration what still needs to be done.\r\nRegarding peace and security issues, the view of\r\nthe Secretary-General that sustainable peace and\r\nsecurity for all countries remains a central objective of\r\nthe United Nations is shared by the people of\r\nKyrgyzstan. The report (A/55/305) of the Panel led by\r\nMr. Brahimi contains many interesting ideas that\r\nshould be developed and elaborated into the future\r\nprogramme of United Nations activities in this field.\r\nMy delegation supports the concept of conflict\r\nprevention and of moving from a culture of reaction to\r\na culture of prevention. We welcome the establishment\r\nof a Prevention Team within the Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs. We believe that early identification of\r\npossible grave conflicts should help the world avoid\r\nthem. We fully agree that the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations should be strengthened by\r\nadditional human resources.\r\nWe welcome the outcome of the year 2000\r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and urge\r\nall States, particularly the nuclear-weapon States, to\r\nfollow up on the commitments they made at the\r\nConference.\r\nWorld security is threatened not only by the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but by\r\nthe harmful effects of armed conflicts — including\r\ninternational terrorism, drug smuggling and illicit\r\ntrafficking in small arms — which are not confined\r\nwithin the national borders of any one country.\r\nKyrgyzstan today faces a drug trafficking\r\nproblem which has threatened to severely undermine\r\nits national security. According to the analysis of World\r\nHealth Organization experts in Kyrgyzstan, 75 per cent\r\nof the drug addicts are under 30 years old. In spite of\r\nthe energetic measures taken by the Kyrgyz\r\nGovernment, the number of drug-related deaths had\r\nincreased fourfold by this year. This means that the\r\nthreat of drug abuse and drug trafficking has not been\r\novercome. In this regard, we will welcome and actively\r\nsupport the efforts of the international community\r\naimed at eliminating this evil.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour gratitude to the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme for its close collaboration on this\r\nissue. Kyrgyzstan will support and contribute to\r\nstrengthening the global consensus on combating illicit\r\ndrug trafficking. I also join others in supporting the\r\nproposal to hold an international conference in 2001 to\r\naddress the issue of small arms proliferation.\r\nAs regards meeting humanitarian commitments, if\r\npeace and security is the central objective of the United\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nNations, humanitarian assistance is the most\r\nchallenging and noble activity that it undertakes.\r\nMillions of people who are being helped by the Office\r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and by\r\nUnited Nations humanitarian agencies trust in the\r\nUnited Nations as a friend in need. We believe that\r\npeople’s trust is the most important indicator of the\r\neffectiveness of our Organization.\r\nWe strongly believe that the international efforts\r\nto eradicate HIV/AIDS, which has become a major\r\nproblem for entire regions of the world, should be\r\nstrengthened. My delegation co-sponsored the draft\r\nresolution on this issue and has a strong commitment to\r\nproviding all possible support to the activities in this\r\nfield. We support the idea of holding, on an urgent\r\nbasis, a special session to review the problem of\r\nHIV/AIDS in all its aspects.\r\nI turn to the subject of cooperating for\r\ndevelopment. The part of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport concerning the elimination of poverty worldwide\r\ntouches on the most important development goals of\r\nthe United Nations. As regards the United Nations\r\nactivities, I commend the group chaired by the United\r\nNations Development Programme to prepare a proposal\r\nfor a system-wide poverty-reduction strategy. We\r\nbelieve that eliminating the gap between the developed\r\ncountries, on the one hand, and the developing\r\ncountries and countries with economies in transition,\r\non the other, involves inter alia establishing a fair\r\nmechanism so that the developing countries and the\r\ncountries with economies in transition can participate\r\nefficiently in the international trade and economic\r\nsystem.\r\nKyrgyzstan anticipates a positive outcome of the\r\npreparations for the Rio + 10 conference in 2002. The\r\nconference will provide an important opportunity to\r\nassess the status of the progress achieved in meeting\r\nthe goals established by the 1992 Earth Summit, where\r\nGovernments took a historic step towards ensuring the\r\nfuture of the planet, adopting a comprehensive plan for\r\nglobal action in all areas relating to sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, 2002 has also been\r\nproclaimed the International Year of Mountains.\r\nMountains are a source of hope; their multiplicity of\r\nfunctions makes them an obvious focal point of human\r\nconcern. The Year gives us an opportunity to ensure the\r\npresent and future well-being of mountain communities\r\nby promoting conservation and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in mountain areas; to increase awareness\r\nand knowledge of mountain ecosystems, their\r\ndynamics and functioning, and their overriding\r\nimportance in providing a number of strategic goods\r\nand services essential to the well-being of both rural\r\nand urban, highland and lowland, people, particularly\r\nwater supply and food security; to promote and defend\r\nthe cultural heritage of mountain communities; and to\r\npay attention to frequent conflicts in mountain areas\r\nand promote peacemaking in those regions.\r\nKyrgyzstan appreciates the work already\r\nundertaken to achieve sustainable mountain\r\ndevelopment by States and by organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations system, in particular the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization, and non-governmental\r\norganizations. We appreciate the commitment of the\r\nGovernment of Switzerland, particularly the Swiss\r\nAgency for Development and Cooperation, to raising\r\npublic awareness in this field, and the commitment of\r\nnon-governmental organizations, in particular the\r\nMountain Forum of the United States and the\r\nInternational Centre for Integrated Mountain\r\nDevelopment of Nepal, scientists, researchers and mass\r\nmedia from all countries. They all contribute to making\r\nthe International Year of Mountains the year of hope,\r\nthe year of the future and the year of our life.\r\nThe end of the International Year of Mountains\r\nshould be the beginning of the consistent and forward-\r\nlooking development of mountain regions. We believe\r\nthat it is vitally important to adopt a new approach to\r\nthe understanding of mountain regions and to change\r\npublic awareness.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate our commitment to work\r\nvery closely with the President, to achieve our common\r\ngoal of the success of the fifty-fifth session.\r\nMr. Al-Hinai (Oman): At the outset I express on\r\nbehalf of my delegation our sincere gratitude and\r\nappreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General,\r\nfor his annual report on the work of the Organization,\r\nan important report that deserves the attention of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe share the view expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the turn of the millennium provides a\r\nunique vantage point from which to view the progress\r\nachieved and the challenges that lie ahead. The\r\nMillennium Summit, which was held at the beginning\r\nof this month, was an opportunity to exchange views\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\non these issues and to seek solutions to the common\r\nchallenges that face humanity.\r\nRegarding the question of humanitarian\r\nintervention, we believe the Secretary-General was\r\nright when he pointed out that there would be strong\r\nreactions by Member States on this issue. We\r\nemphasize that the focus of the Organization should\r\nand must remain within the confines and mandates\r\nspecified by the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe sanctions regime is another issue that\r\nreceived greater attention during the Millennium\r\nSummit. Despite the fact that the sanctions regime was\r\nintended as a political mechanism to guarantee that\r\nGovernments would implement their commitments in\r\naccordance with United Nations resolutions, this\r\nmechanism has now become a weapon that has harmed\r\nthe basic rights of societies, which undoubtedly\r\ncontradicts the letter and spirit of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. We endorse the call on\r\nthe Security Council to adopt new policies and\r\neffective mechanisms to relieve the suffering imposed\r\non States and people. The Security Council, with its\r\nresponsibilities defined by the Charter, should without\r\ndoubt play a positive and unifying role to maintain\r\ninternational peace and stability.\r\nIt remains to be said that the greatest challenge\r\nfacing the Organization today is to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security. In this regard, we\r\ncommend the work of the Panel on United Nations\r\nPeace Operations chaired by Ambassador Brahimi for\r\nits comprehensive report (A/55/305) and bold\r\nrecommendations. We are of the view that the report\r\ndeserves serious and urgent attention from Member\r\nStates. We cannot but emphasize the need for\r\nconsensus on this issue and the need to avoid stretching\r\nthe capabilities of the Organization beyond its intended\r\ncapacity, where it might become party to conflicts. We\r\nalso believe that the United Nations should strictly\r\nadhere to the provisions of the Charter within a clear\r\nand concise mandate, with the full acceptance of the\r\nparties involved in conflicts.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations and its organs\r\nremains a lofty goal and a high endeavour which\r\ncontinues to receive complete support from my\r\ndelegation. We should review the expansion of Security\r\nCouncil membership to reflect a fair representation and\r\nthe changes that have occurred in the world since 1945.\r\nIn recent years globalization has become an\r\nunavoidable force. While it brings benefits to certain\r\nsocieties in the developed world, it has had, on the\r\nother hand, a negative impact on others in the\r\ndeveloping countries. Therefore, we call on the\r\ninternational community, and especially on the\r\ndeveloped countries, to take into account the concerns\r\nof the developing countries, with the aim of narrowing\r\nthe economic and technological gap.\r\nIn the same vein, we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call to tackle the challenges facing Africa\r\nand the least developed countries: the eradication of\r\npoverty, the improvement of health standards and\r\neducation, and the combating of the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic, all of which necessitate a collaborative effort\r\nby all Members of the United Nations. In this regard,\r\nwe call on the international community to spare no\r\neffort to help the African countries and the least\r\ndeveloped countries to face the challenges. Measures to\r\nbe taken should include the relief of debt.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that the time has come\r\nfor all of us to work together to further the lofty goals\r\nand aspirations that we all have. Indeed, the turn of the\r\nmillennium has given us the opportunity to revamp the\r\nUnited Nations and to bring it to a level that could\r\nmeet the challenges that lie ahead.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this agenda item.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of the report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: We have concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 10.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/55/250/Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw\r\nattention to the second report of the General\r\nCommittee (A/55/250/Add.1), concerning a request by\r\nEquatorial Guinea for the inclusion in the agenda of an\r\nadditional item, “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Economic Community of Central\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.31\r\nAfrican States”, and a request contained in a letter\r\ndated 25 September 2000 from the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Italy to the United Nations.\r\nIn paragraph 1 of the report, the General\r\nCommittee decided to recommend to the General\r\nAssembly that an additional item entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States” should be\r\nincluded in the agenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto include this additional item in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Committee\r\nfurther decided to recommend to the General Assembly\r\nthat the additional item should be considered directly\r\nin plenary meeting. May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly decides to consider the item directly in\r\nplenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In paragraph 2 of the\r\nreport, the General Committee decided to recommend\r\nto the General Assembly that agenda item 105, “Crime\r\nprevention and criminal justice”, should also be\r\nconsidered directly in plenary meeting for the sole\r\npurpose of taking action on the draft United Nations\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\r\nthe draft protocols thereto.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto consider agenda item 105 directly in plenary\r\nmeeting for the sole purpose of taking action on the\r\ndraft United Nations Convention against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime and the draft protocols thereto?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to announce\r\nsome additions to the programme of work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.
