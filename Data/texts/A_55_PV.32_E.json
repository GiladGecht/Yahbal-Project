(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Roosevelt Douglas, late Prime\r\nMinister of Dominica\r\nThe President: It is my sad duty to pay tribute to\r\nthe memory of the late Prime Minister of Dominica,\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Roosevelt Douglas,\r\nwho passed away on 1 October 2000.\r\nHe was a prominent political leader in Dominica\r\nand had been its Prime Minister since February of this\r\nyear. It was only last month that the General Assembly\r\nheard his statements at the Millennium Summit and in\r\nthe general debate.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I request the\r\nrepresentative of Dominica to convey our condolences\r\nto the Government and people of Dominica and to the\r\nbereaved family of His Excellency The Honourable\r\nRoosevelt Douglas.\r\nI invite representatives to stand and observe a\r\nminute of silence in tribute to the memory of His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Roosevelt Douglas.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Dominica.\r\nMr. Richards (Dominica): Mr. President, I wish\r\nto thank you and the members of your staff for\r\narranging this tribute to The Honourable Roosevelt\r\nDouglas, the late Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Dominica. On\r\nbehalf of the Douglas family and the Government and\r\npeople of Dominica, I would also like to use this\r\nopportunity to express our sincere thanks to those from\r\nwhom we have received words of comfort and\r\nexpressions of sympathy at this moment of sadness for\r\nall Dominicans.\r\nHonourable Roosevelt Douglas was born in\r\nPortsmouth, Dominica, on 15 October 1941. The\r\nsecond son of a relatively prosperous family, “Rosie”,\r\nas he was popularly known throughout the Caribbean,\r\ndemonstrated at an early age a willingness to assist the\r\nless fortunate, and that caring and generous spirit\r\nshaped his character and outlook.\r\nAfter completing his secondary education,\r\nHonourable Roosevelt Douglas left Dominica in 1961\r\nto pursue studies in agriculture at the University of\r\nGuelph in Canada. Upon graduation from Guelph, the\r\nyoung Roosevelt Douglas changed course and courses,\r\nproceeding to study political science at McGill\r\nUniversity. That he should choose politics over\r\nagriculture is not surprising; both his father and his\r\nolder brother, Michael, had been successful politicians\r\nand Members of Parliament before him. But his\r\npolitical journey began in inauspicious circumstances,\r\nand he was destined to go down a political path not\r\ntravelled by either his father or brother.\r\nThe late Honourable Roosevelt Douglas was\r\npursuing doctoral studies in political science when the\r\nturbulent events of the 1960s and his life experiences\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.32\r\nin Canada impelled him to take an uncompromising\r\nstand against racism and the discrimination and\r\nindignity associated with it. As a consequence, his\r\nstudies came to an end. On his return to Dominica in\r\n1976, he immediately immersed himself in local\r\npolitics and joined forces with those campaigning for\r\nindependence from Britain.\r\nThe late Roosevelt Douglas was elected to the\r\nDominica Parliament for the first time in 1985. From\r\n1982 until his death, he was the leader of the Labour\r\nParty of Dominica, and from 1996 to 1999 he served as\r\nLeader of the Opposition in Parliament. On 4 February\r\n2000 Honourable Roosevelt Douglas was sworn in as\r\nthe fifth Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica.\r\nThroughout his adult life Roosevelt Douglas had\r\na singular passionate commitment to the struggle for\r\nthe liberation of black people everywhere and for the\r\neconomic and political empowerment of the poor and\r\ndisadvantaged. Driven by that commitment and his\r\nconcern for social and economic justice, he became\r\ninvolved in the 1980s and 1990s in international\r\nsolidarity work in various parts of the world. In\r\nsouthern Africa, in particular, he played an important\r\nrole in support of the South West Africa People’s\r\nOrganization (SWAPO) and the African National\r\nCongress (ANC) in the struggle against apartheid.\r\nDuring that period he also established significant\r\nrelationships with other Labour Parties and\r\nGovernments in Europe. In the course of his brief\r\nstewardship as Prime Minister of Dominica, he\r\npromoted those relationships as building blocks of a\r\nnew cooperative effort to develop relationships with\r\nEurope.\r\nNever a politician in the conventional mould, the\r\nlate Prime Minister energized the political debate in his\r\nown country and in the Caribbean by frequently\r\nexpressing views and advocating positions considered\r\npolitically unwise by some. In his quest for dignity,\r\nrespect and better economic conditions for the less\r\nprivileged, the Prime Minister would not allow himself\r\nto be distracted by criticism at home or abroad.\r\nNot everyone shared his vision of a humane and\r\njust society and the mechanisms for achieving that\r\ngoal. But, if the late Prime Minister were to speak to\r\nthis Assembly today, I think he would feel very\r\ncomfortable with the following quotation from George\r\nBernard Shaw:\r\n“You see things; and you say, ‘Why?’ But I dream\r\nthings that never were; and I say, ‘Why not?’”\r\nThe legacy of Roosevelt Bernard Douglas is that he\r\ndared to ask “why not”, and in so doing touched in a\r\nfundamental way the lives of many people in\r\nDominica, the Caribbean and elsewhere.\r\nHonourable Roosevelt Douglas passed on\r\nsuddenly and untimely on Sunday, 1 October 2000 at\r\nhis residence in Portsmouth, Dominica. The\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica has lost one of its\r\nillustrious sons, a consistent fighter for freedom and\r\nsocial and economic justice, a man whose vision,\r\nengaging personality, sense of humour and ability to\r\ncommunicate with people at all levels made him one of\r\nthe Caribbean’s leading political figures.\r\nWhile the people of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica mourn his loss, we are thankful for the 58\r\nyears he spent among us.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I would like to draw the attention\r\nof the General Assembly to document\r\nA/INF/55/3/Add.1, which covers the period 10 October\r\nthrough 30 November, and which has already been\r\ncirculated to Member States.\r\nOther than the items already cited in the previous\r\nprogramme of work, the lists of speakers for additional\r\nitems mentioned in document A/INF/55/3/Add.1 are\r\nopen.\r\nThe General Assembly will, in due course, be\r\nkept informed of the dates for the consideration of\r\nother agenda items, as well as of any additions or\r\nchanges.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President: I should now like to make an\r\nannouncement concerning agenda item 20, entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations,\r\nincluding special economic assistance”.\r\nI have requested Mr. Hubert Wurth, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg to the United Nations,\r\nto be coordinator of the informal consultations on the\r\ndraft resolutions under agenda item 20 and he has\r\ngraciously accepted.\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.32\r\nMay I request those delegations intending to\r\nsubmit draft resolutions under agenda item 20 to do so\r\nas early as possible in order to allow time, if need be,\r\nfor negotiations with a view to reaching consensus on\r\nthe draft resolutions.\r\nIn this connection, I should like to inform\r\nmembers that the first meeting of the informal\r\nconsultations will be held on Wednesday, 25 October at\r\n3 p.m. in conference room 8.\r\nAgenda item 122 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/55/345/Add.6,\r\nAdd.7 and Add.8)\r\nThe President: In the letters contained in\r\ndocuments A/55/345/Add.6, A/55/345/Add.7 and\r\nA/55/345/Add.8, the Secretary-General informs the\r\nPresident that, since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications contained in document A/55/345 and\r\naddenda 1 to 5, Dominica, Chad and Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines, respectively, have made the necessary\r\npayments to reduce their arrears below the amount\r\nspecified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly\r\nduly takes note of the information contained\r\nin documents A/55/345/Add.6, A/55/345/Add.7 and\r\nA/55/345/Add.8?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\nproceed to the election of five non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council to replace those members\r\nwhose term of office expires on 31 December 2000.\r\nThe five outgoing non-permanent members are\r\nthe following: Argentina, Canada, Malaysia, Namibia\r\nand the Netherlands. Those five States cannot be re-\r\nelected and therefore their names should not appear on\r\nthe ballot papers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the\r\nSecurity Council will include in 2001 the following\r\nStates: Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and\r\nUkraine. The names of those States, therefore, should\r\nalso not appear on the ballot papers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members which will\r\nremain in office in 2001, three are from Africa and\r\nAsia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December\r\n1963, the five non-permanent members should be\r\nelected according to the following pattern: two from\r\nAfrica and Asia, one from Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean and two from among the Western European\r\nand other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is\r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the two States to\r\nbe elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from\r\nAfrica and one from Asia.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those\r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of\r\nseats to be filled, who receive the greatest number of\r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of members present and\r\nvoting will be declared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there\r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nwhich have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures for the two vacant seats\r\nfrom among the African and Asian States, the\r\nChairman of the Group of Asian States has informed\r\nthe Secretariat that the Group has endorsed Singapore.\r\nThe Chairman of the Group of African States has\r\ninformed the Secretariat that the Group has endorsed\r\nthe Sudan. However, in this connection, the following\r\ncommunications have been circulated as official\r\ndocuments of the General Assembly: documents\r\nA/55/457 and A/55/463. In addition, in document\r\nA/55/464, the Permanent Representative of Mauritius\r\npresents the candidature of Mauritius as well.\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.32\r\nRegarding the candidature for the vacant seat\r\nfrom among the Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nStates, the Chairman of the Group has informed the\r\nSecretariat that the Group has endorsed Colombia.\r\nRegarding candidatures for the two vacant seats\r\nfrom among the Western European and Other States,\r\nthe Chairman of the Group has informed the Secretariat\r\nthat there are three candidates: Ireland, Italy and\r\nNorway.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall proceed now to the election by\r\nsecret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules\r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now\r\nbe distributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed and to write on them\r\nthe names of the five States for which they wish to\r\nvote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid. Names of Members States on\r\na ballot paper that do not belong to that region will not\r\nbe counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Pokaz\r\n(Croatia), Mr. Kitagawa (Japan) and Mr. Parrales\r\nSánchez (Nicaragua) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.30 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African and Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 173\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:     0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 173\r\nAbstentions:     1\r\nNumber of members voting: 172\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 115\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSingapore 168\r\nMauritius 95\r\nSudan 69\r\nGroup B — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 173\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:     0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 173\r\nAbstentions:     5\r\nNumber of members voting: 168\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 112\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nColombia 168\r\nGroup C — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 173\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:     0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 173\r\nAbstentions:     0\r\nNumber of members voting: 173\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 116\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nIreland 130\r\nNorway 114\r\nItaly  94\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nthe following States were elected members of the\r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning\r\n1 January 2001: Colombia, Ireland and\r\nSingapore.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that\r\nhave been elected members of the Security Council.\r\nThere remain two seats to be filled, one from\r\namong the African and Asian States, and one from\r\namong the Western European and other States.
