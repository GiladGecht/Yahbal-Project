(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 15 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic\r\nand Social Council\r\nThe President: This morning, the General\r\nAssembly will proceed to the election of 18 members\r\nof the Economic and Social Council to replace those\r\nmembers whose term of office expires on 31 December\r\n2000.\r\nThe 18 outgoing members are Algeria, Belarus,\r\nBelgium, Brazil, Colombia, the Comoros, India, Italy,\r\nLesotho, Mauritius, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan,\r\nPoland, Saint Lucia, Sierra Leone, the United States of\r\nAmerica and Viet Nam.\r\nAs of 1 January 2001, the following States will\r\ncontinue to be represented on the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil: Angola, Austria, Bahrain, Benin, Bolivia,\r\nBulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, China,\r\nCosta Rica, Croatia, Cuba, the Czech Republic, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Fiji,\r\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras,\r\nIndonesia, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Portugal,\r\nthe Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia,\r\nSuriname, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Sudan, the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\r\nand Venezuela. The names of these 36 States should\r\ntherefore not appear on the ballots.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December\r\n1971, and taking into account the number of States that\r\nwill remain members of the Council after 1 January\r\n2001, the 18 members should be elected as follows:\r\nfive from African States, four from Asian States, two\r\nfrom Eastern European States, three from Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and four from Western\r\nEuropean and other States. The ballot papers reflect\r\nthis pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those\r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of\r\nseats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of\r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of those present and\r\nvoting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote\r\nfor a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot\r\nlimited to those candidates that have obtained an equal\r\nnumber of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, the Chairmen of the\r\nrespective regional Groups have informed the\r\nSecretariat that, for the five vacant seats from among\r\nthe African States, the Group has endorsed five\r\ncandidates: Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa and\r\nUganda.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.33\r\nFor the four vacant seats from among the Asian\r\nStates, there are six candidates: the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Republic of\r\nKorea and the United Arab Emirates.\r\nFor the two vacant seats from among the Eastern\r\nEuropean States, the Group has endorsed two\r\ncandidates: Georgia and Romania.\r\nFor the three vacant seats from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, there are four\r\ncandidates. They are Argentina, Brazil, Peru and\r\nTrinidad and Tobago.\r\nFor the four vacant seats from among the Western\r\nEuropean and other States, the Group has endorsed\r\nfour candidates: Andorra, Italy, the Netherlands and the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by\r\nsecret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the\r\nelection. As members are all aware, once the voting\r\nbegins, all campaigning should cease on the main floor\r\nof the General Assembly Hall. This means in particular\r\nthat, until the election is completed, no more campaign\r\nmaterial can be distributed inside the Hall and all\r\nrepresentatives are requested to remain at their seats.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”\r\nwill now be distributed. I request representatives to use\r\nonly those ballot papers and to write on them the\r\nnames of the States for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a\r\nballot paper that do not belong to that region will not\r\nbe counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Holliday\r\n(Australia), Mr. Jara (Chile), Ms. Nangula\r\n(Namibia), Mr. Priputen (Slovakia) and\r\nMs. Upakarnitikaset (Thailand) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.05 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A – African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 166\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 165\r\nAbstentions: 5\r\nNumber of members voting: 160\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 107\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nEgypt 157\r\nEthiopia 155\r\nNigeria 152\r\nSouth Africa 152\r\nUganda 141\r\nTunisia 1\r\nSwaziland 1\r\nGroup B – Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 166\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 165\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 164\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 110\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nPakistan 125\r\nRepublic of Korea 115\r\nNepal 104\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran 103\r\nUnited Arab Emirates 95\r\nPhilippines 89\r\nKyrgyzstan 1\r\nGroup C – Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 166\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 165\r\nAbstentions: 7\r\nNumber of members voting: 158\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 106\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nRomania 152\r\nGeorgia 148\r\nPoland 7\r\nLithuania 1\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.33\r\nGroup D – Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 166\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 2\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 164\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 163\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 109\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBrazil 122\r\nPeru 115\r\nArgentina 113\r\nTrinidad and Tobago 106\r\nGuatemala 1\r\nHaiti 1\r\nGroup E – Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 166\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 2\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 164\r\nAbstentions: 4\r\nNumber of members voting: 160\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 107\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nAndorra 156\r\nItaly 156\r\nUnited States of America 148\r\nNetherlands 147\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nAndorra, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia,\r\nGeorgia, Italy, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan,\r\nPeru, the Republic of Korea, Romania, South\r\nAfrica, Uganda and the United States of America\r\nwere elected members of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil for a three-year term beginning 1 January\r\n2001.\r\nThe President: There remain two seats to be\r\nfilled from among the Asian States.
