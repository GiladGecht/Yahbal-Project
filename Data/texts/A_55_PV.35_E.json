During the year under review, the Council held\r\n144 formal meetings, adopted 57 resolutions and issued\r\n38 statements by the President. In addition, the Council\r\nmembers held 194 consultations of the whole. The\r\nCouncil also considered over 85 reports by the\r\nSecretary-General and reviewed and processed more\r\nthan 1,165 documents and communications from States\r\nand regional and other international organizations.\r\nFurthermore, the Council dispatched four missions to\r\nvarious conflict areas.\r\nIn line with its primary responsibility under the\r\nCharter for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, the Security Council considered a wide range\r\nof issues. Ensuring stability in Africa and other regions\r\nhas remained high on the agenda of the Council. With\r\nregard to Africa, the Council extensively considered\r\nsituations in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Sierra Leone, Eritrea/Ethiopia, Somalia,\r\nBurundi and Western Sahara. In this connection,\r\nSecurity Council missions were dispatched to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nEritrea/Ethiopia. Peacekeeping operations in Guinea-\r\nBissau and the Central African Republic have been\r\nsuccessfully transformed into post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding support offices.\r\nThe Security Council also considered conflict\r\nsituations in the Middle East; East Timor; Afghanistan;\r\nTajikistan; Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia;\r\nand Abkhazia, Georgia. Missions were dispatched to\r\nEast Timor and Kosovo.\r\nThe Security Council considered decisions and\r\nadopted statements on a number of broad peace and\r\nsecurity issues, including the protection of civilians in\r\narmed conflict; children and armed conflict; and\r\ndisarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants. It also considered\r\nHIV/AIDS and international peace and security. In\r\ndealing with these matters the Security Council\r\nremained highly conscious of its responsibility and of\r\nthe role being played by other United Nations bodies.\r\nDuring the reporting period the Security Council\r\nwent to great lengths to conduct its business in a more\r\ntransparent manner. In this regard, many open meetings\r\nand briefings were held with the participation of the\r\nwider membership of the United Nations.\r\nThe members of the Security Council trust that\r\nthe report will shed more light and provide useful\r\ninformation on the activities of the Council during the\r\nyear. They attach utmost significance and importance\r\nto this annual consideration of the report by the\r\nGeneral Assembly as a means of enhancing further the\r\nwork of these two principal organs of the United\r\nNations. The members of the Security Council look\r\nforward to the comments and suggestions of the\r\nMember States during this meeting.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing the appreciation\r\nof the members of the Security Council to the staff of\r\nthe Security Council secretariat for their dedication and\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\ntireless efforts, which remain indispensable to the\r\nefficiency of the work of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus thanks\r\nAmbassador Andjaba of Namibia for having introduced\r\nthe annual report of the Security Council to the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We would also like to\r\ntake note of the important role played last year by\r\nNamibia in the work of the Council.\r\nBelarus is convinced that the annual reporting\r\npractice of the Security Council remains an important\r\npart of the efforts to make the activities of the Council\r\nas open and transparent as possible, as well as to allow\r\nthe Member States to adequately evaluate the decisions\r\ntaken by the Council in the area of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe work of the Security Council was particularly\r\ninvolved last year, given the numerous conflicts in\r\nKosovo, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and other regions of the world. The Council’s\r\nefforts were crucial to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The international community saw\r\nthe Council adopt many important decisions and\r\nresolutions, as reflected in the present report.\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus notes\r\nwith satisfaction that the Council is examining more\r\nand more subjects besides current conflicts.\r\nIncreasingly, the Council considers the root causes that\r\nlead to crises and military confrontation. Last year we\r\nwitnessed the Council’s important debates on the\r\nparticipation of children in armed conflicts, the\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants, international terrorism\r\nand the illicit trafficking of diamonds and other natural\r\nresources — a trade that has been used not for\r\npromoting peace, but to support forces involved in\r\nconflicts.\r\nLast year, problems relating to sanctions were a\r\nspecial part of the Council’s work. We welcome the\r\nfact that the practice in this field of the principal\r\nUnited Nations organ responsible for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security has became more\r\nsophisticated. The extremely complex humanitarian\r\nsituations in Iraq and in other States on which\r\nsanctions have been imposed continue to call for\r\nfurther work to reduce the negative impact of sanctions\r\non civilians. In this context, the Republic of Belarus\r\nnotes the particular importance of the inclusion in the\r\nannual report of the reports of the sanctions\r\ncommittees, whose operations had until now been\r\nabsolutely closed to the majority of States. Belarus\r\nsupports the continuation of this practice.\r\nBelarus welcomes the fact noted in the report\r\nthat, compared with the previous period, the Council\r\nheld significantly more open meetings last year. This is\r\nundoubtedly an important step in making the Council’s\r\nwork more transparent. Belarus will support all further\r\nmeasures that allow non-member States to participate\r\nmore fully in the Council’s deliberations on all issues.\r\nIn this context, we consider that the next important step\r\ncould be publishing as press releases issued from\r\nUnited Nations Headquarters the content of the daily\r\nbriefings that give an account of the closed\r\nconsultations of the Council.\r\nWe believe that the summaries that the Council\r\nmembers prepare regarding the work of the Council\r\nduring their presidencies are of crucial importance.\r\nBelarus believes that these summaries facilitate a more\r\nprofound analysis of the Council’s work and the\r\nfinding of new ways to improve the work of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Millennium Summit and the high-level\r\nSecurity Council meeting demonstrated to the world\r\nthe unanimity of the Member States with regard to the\r\npriority role of the Council in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Strong adherence to\r\nthe Charter’s principles in this regard is, we believe,\r\nthe way to ensure that future generations are spared the\r\nscourge of war. Belarus will be submitting its\r\ncandidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Council for\r\n2002-2003 on the basis of its firm commitment to the\r\nfulfilment of the provisions of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration adopted by the heads of States and\r\nGovernments and its commitment to work vigorously\r\nto further improve the Council’s work.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador Martin\r\nAndjaba of Namibia, for his presentation of the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly.\r\nWe have often heard the Council reiterating that it\r\nhas primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as that it has\r\nthe authority to act on behalf of all Member States in\r\ncarrying out its duties in fulfilment of this\r\nresponsibility. These are very important provisions of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, and it is precisely\r\nthese provisions that made the Security Council into\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nthe most powerful organ of the United Nations system.\r\nHowever, it is equally essential to recall that this\r\nunique authority was delegated to the Security Council\r\nin conjunction with its obligation to report regularly to\r\nthe General Assembly. Article 24 of the Charter is very\r\nclear about this link.\r\nUkraine attaches particular importance to the item\r\n“Report of the Security Council”, as it has always\r\nbelieved that its main purpose was to uphold the\r\nprinciple of accountability, which we consider\r\nfundamental to the effectiveness of the Organization’s\r\nactivities in the area of peace and security. This is the\r\nfirst time that Ukraine has made its contribution to this\r\nimportant discussion as an elected member of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIndeed, consideration of this agenda item offers\r\nthe General Assembly a unique opportunity to make a\r\ncomprehensive assessment of the Council’s activities\r\nover the past year. My delegation believes that if we\r\nevaluate this period from the larger perspective of the\r\npast decade, we may find many reasons to characterize\r\nit as the promising beginning of a new phase in the\r\nSecurity Council’s history.\r\nThe significant shift in peacekeeping activities\r\ncould be one of the most convincing arguments in\r\nsupport of that assertion. According to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s latest report on the work of the Organization,\r\nthe size of the Council’s authorized deployment has\r\nalmost tripled over the past 12 months, standing now at\r\napproximately 45,000 uniformed personnel.\r\nThe significant increase in peacekeeping\r\noperations, as well as some serious setbacks on the\r\nground, initiated the current efforts to improve the\r\neffectiveness of this key instrument available to the\r\nUnited Nations in discharging its responsibility for\r\npeace and security. Ukraine will continue encouraging\r\nthe Council to make a major contribution to this\r\nendeavour.\r\nWe may also recall how harshly the Security\r\nCouncil was criticized not so long ago for its lack of\r\nresponse to the demands of the African continent.\r\nToday, we have ample evidence of the major drift in\r\nthe Council’s overall policy towards Africa. The\r\nchanges are really tangible. The substantially expanded\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, the\r\nauthorization of the second phase of the United Nations\r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, the deployment of the United Nations\r\nMission in Eritrea and Ethiopia and the Council’s\r\naction on the report by the Panel of Experts on\r\nViolations of Security Council Sanctions against\r\nUNITA are only some of the Council’s highlights\r\nrelated to Africa.\r\nThe major task ahead is to sustain this action-\r\noriented stance of the Council towards Africa and to\r\nfocus it on preventing the recurrence or further\r\naggravation of conflicts. It is high time to think in more\r\npractical terms about strengthening the overall capacity\r\nof the United Nations for effective preventive action.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to reiterate the proposal\r\nput forward by President Kuchma of Ukraine that a\r\ncomprehensive conflict prevention strategy be\r\ndeveloped for the United Nations. Ukraine has made a\r\nnumber of suggestions as to what could become\r\nconcrete elements of such a strategy. In particular, one\r\nof its key components could be the establishment of\r\nUnited Nations regional centres for conflict prevention.\r\nAnother integral element could be conflict prevention\r\noperations, which should gain prominence as a\r\nqualitatively new model of peacekeeping activities.\r\nIn this regard, let me draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to the increasing impact of the conflict in\r\nSierra Leone and its further spillover into the\r\nneighbouring countries, in particular Guinea. The\r\ninternational community must be prepared to act in\r\nurgent support of the intention of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States to prepare for the\r\npreventive deployment of an observer force on the\r\nborders of the Mano River Union countries.\r\nAnother important change in the Security\r\nCouncil’s work over the past year is the rebirth of its\r\nspecial missions to conflict areas, which have been\r\ndispatched over the past 12 months to East Timor,\r\nKosovo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nEritrea/Ethiopia. The recently completed mission to\r\nSierra Leone — the largest ever such mission of the\r\nSecurity Council — proved that this instrument has\r\nbecome indispensable to the effective discharge of that\r\norgan’s responsibilities.\r\nWe have also seen the Security Council starting\r\nto rethink its overall policy with regard to economic\r\nsanctions in order to improve their effectiveness as\r\nwell as avoid their negative side effects. In April 2000,\r\nthe Council established a working group on sanctions\r\nto develop relevant recommendations on those matters.\r\nIn May 2000, the Council set an important precedent\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nby defining time limits for sanctions at the stage of\r\ntheir imposition. Ukraine believes that it is very\r\nimportant to ensure that the new trends in this domain\r\nbring about a clear and coherent methodology for the\r\nimposition and lifting of sanctions that takes into\r\nconsideration the concerns of civilian populations and\r\nthe interests of third countries.\r\nAlthough the list of new developments and\r\nchanges I have referred to is far from complete, I think\r\nit gives enough grounds to state that the work of the\r\nSecurity Council during the past year represents a clear\r\nstep forward. This assessment is even more convincing\r\nif we recall the Council’s record from June 1998 to\r\nJune 1999. It was marked by a set of disappointments\r\nthat made the larger international community question\r\nthe ability of the Council to play a leading role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to\r\nrespond adequately to emerging crises and other\r\nchallenges.\r\nIt is very important now to sustain these very\r\nencouraging trends in the Council’s activities into the\r\nfuture. A significant contribution to this major task was\r\nmade by the Security Council Summit held on 7\r\nSeptember 2000. The results of that important meeting\r\nrepresent a vivid demonstration of the Security\r\nCouncil’s willingness to remain a functioning and\r\nindispensable actor in international affairs in the new\r\ncentury. Ukraine will pay special attention to the\r\npractical implementation of the Security Council\r\nSummit commitments.\r\nI would also like to use this occasion to restate\r\nUkraine’s determination to continue upholding by\r\npractical deeds its responsible status as a current\r\nmember of the Security Council. Ukraine is redeeming\r\nits pledge to the member States of the General\r\nAssembly, which conferred on it the high honour of\r\nserving on the Council. I would like to stress that, for\r\nthe past year, there has been no single newly\r\nestablished or substantially expanded peacekeeping\r\noperation — from the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo to Sierra Leone, southern Lebanon, Kosovo,\r\nEast Timor and Ethiopia and Eritrea — to which\r\nUkraine has not contributed trained and properly\r\nequipped personnel.\r\nI would like to conclude by offering our warm\r\ncongratulations to Colombia, Ireland, Mauritius,\r\nNorway and Singapore on their recent election to serve\r\non the Security Council as of 1 January 2001. Ukraine\r\nis looking forward to close and productive cooperation\r\nwith the newly elected members of the Council and\r\nwishes them every success in discharging their very\r\nimportant responsibilities.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): May I begin by thanking the\r\nPresident of the Security Council for introducing the\r\nreport of the Council. I congratulate Colombia, Ireland,\r\nMauritius, Norway and Singapore on their election last\r\nweek to the Council.\r\nAll Member States have a deep interest in the\r\nwork of the Security Council and we attach importance\r\nto this discussion, mandated by Articles 24 (3) and 15\r\nof the Charter, which require the Council to submit and\r\nthe General Assembly to receive and consider annual\r\nand special reports. The Charter clearly intends that the\r\nCouncil, to which the general membership entrusts\r\nspecial responsibilities, should report to it each year on\r\nthe issues and situations pertaining to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security it has dealt with,\r\nwhat it has done and the impact of its actions. It is\r\nexpected that these reports should be comprehensive,\r\nsubstantive and forthright.\r\nUnfortunately, the Council’s reports still lack\r\nboth substance and candour. Frustration with the\r\nCouncil’s sketchy reporting led to the adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of resolution 51/193 of 1996, in\r\nwhich it called upon the Council, inter alia, to include\r\ninformation on the consultations of the whole; to\r\nhighlight the extent to which resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly on issues falling within the scope of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council had been\r\ntaken into account by the Council in its decision-\r\nmaking; and to strengthen further the section in the\r\nreport on the steps taken by the Council to improve its\r\nworking methods.\r\nThe Council has ignored this resolution. The\r\nreport before us, a 550-page to me, is, like its\r\npredecessors, simply a compilation of documents, most\r\nof which have already been circulated as official\r\ndocuments. We ask the members of the Council to\r\nconsider if the veil of secrecy which they draw over its\r\nwork serves a purpose. To the general membership, it\r\nappears both lofty, because it flouts the expressed\r\nwishes of the General Assembly, and self-defeating,\r\nbecause it feeds suspicions that the Council is secretive\r\nbecause it evades disclosure. As to the revelations over\r\nwhich it may wish to draw a veil, one can draw from\r\nseveral choices: questions as to effectiveness,\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nselectiveness of engagement, pressure of domestic\r\nconstituencies or narrow agendas.\r\nIf transparency were the guiding principle, the\r\nCouncil would not need to conduct most of its work in\r\ninformal meetings, a mechanism not even mentioned in\r\nits provisional rules of procedure. Rule 48 states that\r\nunless it decides otherwise, the Security Council shall\r\nmeet in public. The holding of informal meetings\r\nshould be the exception and not the unwritten rule that\r\nit has become.\r\nThe Council might very well argue in defence\r\nthat it now holds public debates under almost every\r\npresidency. This, however, would be perilously close to\r\nthe Council telling the general membership to eat cake.\r\nWhen the general membership asked for open meetings\r\nof the Council, it did not want to turn the Council into\r\na debating society, which is what it now becomes every\r\nonce in a while; the membership wanted it, before it\r\nacted on matters of peace and security, to hear the\r\nviews of countries outside the Council that might have\r\na point to make, a perspective to share or advice to\r\noffer, which it would be useful and prudent to factor\r\ninto and reflect in its decisions. The open debates of\r\nthe Council have no bearing on the Council’s decisions,\r\nand frequently they are also on issues outside its\r\nmandate. As decisions are taken before the Council\r\nhears the views of others, the statements made are of\r\nacademic interest, a mere formality. The Council needs\r\nto consider what purpose these open debates serve, if\r\nany. We asked the Council to be transparent; what is\r\noffered is symbolism.\r\nOnce again, sadly, the suspicion is not far-fetched\r\nthat the closed doors of the Council may reflect a\r\nclosed mind and a fear of being told truths it would\r\nmuch rather do without, of being given facts that\r\ncontradict its preferences or of accepting advice that\r\nundermines its settled orientation. Nowhere does this\r\ncreate more of a problem than in the complex\r\npeacekeeping operations it has set up. The Council\r\ndecides, in what is essentially splendid isolation, how\r\nan operation should evolve; it certainly has the right to\r\ndo so under the Charter, but since the tasks it sets have\r\nto be discharged by the forces on the ground, it would\r\nbe sensible to consult troop contributors and profit\r\nfrom their experience. Instead, the Council only goes\r\nthrough the motions, speaking to the troop contributors\r\nthe day before a resolution is adopted. This is merely\r\nthe courteous presentation of a fait accompli; it serves\r\nlittle purpose — not the Council’s, not the host\r\ncountry’s, not those of the troop contributors and\r\ncertainly not those of the operation.\r\nIn May and June this year, when the Council held\r\nclosed meetings, including a private meeting with the\r\nMinisters of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates to address the crisis in the United Nations\r\nMission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), India and other\r\ntroop contributors asked that we be invited to it. We\r\nthought the Council would be anxious to hear the views\r\nof the countries most heavily involved, and were\r\nastonished that our request was turned down. We have\r\nnever been told why. This indifferent treatment is\r\nunacceptable when it is troop contributors, and not the\r\nmembers of the Council, including those who believe\r\nthat they have a special responsibility for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, that put the lives of\r\ntheir troops on the line for the cause of the United\r\nNations.\r\nPeacekeeping operations mandated by the\r\nCouncil will be successful only if their tasks are doable\r\nand they are given adequate resources. A partnership\r\nbetween the Council and the peacekeepers is not just\r\ncrucial, but a prerequisite. This indeed is the spirit of\r\nArticle 44 of the Charter. And it is no surprise that the\r\nBrahimi Panel report, which was welcomed at the\r\nCouncil’s Summit on 7 September, has also\r\nrecommended this. We hope that the Council will do\r\nsome soul-searching and, in the future, will genuinely\r\ninvolve the troop-contributing countries, in a spirit of\r\npartnership, in decisions regarding peacekeeping\r\noperations, including on their mandates. The recent\r\nprivate meeting between troop contributors and the\r\nCouncil on UNAMSIL is a good precedent. However,\r\nit is not enough only to give troop contributors a\r\nhearing; their views should be reflected, if they are\r\nreasonable, in the mandates of the Council. The\r\nCouncil should institutionalize this mechanism.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan remains a cause of\r\ndeep anxiety to the international community,\r\nparticularly to the countries in the region. The\r\nTaliban’s quest for a military solution, their support for\r\ninternational terrorism and their utter disregard for the\r\nhumanitarian crisis they have created in Afghanistan\r\nall continue. We are concerned over both the suffering\r\nthey have inflicted on the Afghan people and their\r\ndestabilizing role in the region. The Security Council,\r\nwhich has repeatedly expressed grave concern over the\r\ndevelopments in Afghanistan, has urged the Taliban to\r\nseek a peaceful solution to the crisis and to end its\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nsupport for terrorism, but to no avail. Security Council\r\nresolution 1267 (1999) was adopted over a year ago,\r\nbut the Taliban remain intransigent. This is a challenge\r\nto the Council.\r\nEven as the Council has not lived up to\r\nexpectations regarding its activities in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, particularly in Africa,\r\nit has continued to try to assume a role for itself in\r\nareas such as health, the welfare of children and\r\nhumanitarian assistance, which are clearly beyond its\r\nmandate and fall under the jurisdiction of the General\r\nAssembly. This does not help the smooth functioning\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nA case in point is the Council’s assuming for\r\nitself the power to set up judicial bodies. Nothing\r\nunder the Charter gives it the right to set up the\r\ntribunals that it has, nor indeed can it be demonstrated\r\nthat those set up have in fact contributed to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security. In fact, they have\r\non occasion become a complicating factor, and it would\r\nbe hard to justify the exponential rise in the cost of\r\nmaintaining them. There is now the piquant\r\ndevelopment of the recommendation to the Security\r\nCouncil from the Presidents of the two Tribunals that\r\nfinancial provisions should be made to recompense\r\nthose who might have been unfairly accused before\r\nthem; potentially, therefore, the General Assembly\r\ncould be looking at huge sums of money which would\r\nhave to be found to compensate persons wrongfully\r\nbrought before tribunals which were wrongfully set up.\r\nAgain, the General Assembly would be merely a\r\npassive and helpless spectator, without a role to play,\r\nexcept to accept the financial implications of decisions\r\narbitrarily taken by the Council. These are systemic\r\nproblems that surely need to be addressed.\r\nMany of the flaws in the functioning of the\r\nCouncil are structural. Its composition and structure are\r\ndemonstrably out of touch with ground realities. The\r\nCouncil neither reflects nor represents the aspirations\r\nand views of the larger membership. It is a relic of a\r\ndefunct era. The solution lies in reforming and\r\nrestructuring the Council. The inclusion of developing\r\ncountries would make the Council more representative,\r\nrelevant and responsive, enhancing the quality of its\r\ndecisions and their acceptability within the general\r\nmembership.\r\nWe have always believed that sanctions are a\r\nblunt instrument and should be carefully used when\r\ntheir imposition becomes imperative. Reports from the\r\nUnited Nations system about the humanitarian crisis\r\ncaused by the sanctions on Iraq are disquieting. We\r\nhave also seen the report by the Secretary-General that\r\nover 1,200 contracts worth over $2 billion under the\r\noil-for-food programme are on hold. Clearly, the\r\nCouncil needs to address this issue with dispatch and\r\nsensitivity.\r\nMr. Ben Mustapha (Tunisia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nOnly last month, our leaders met in this Hall to\r\nreaffirm their common commitment to the United\r\nNations as our instrument of choice to strengthen and\r\nexpand international cooperation as we enter the new\r\nmillennium. It is with a view to building such a United\r\nNations that we have offered our comments on the\r\nreport of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Kastrup (Germany): The report of the\r\nSecurity Council has always been a comprehensive and\r\nlong document which bears witness to the workload of\r\nthe Council. All members of the Security Council\r\ntherefore deserve our respect for shouldering this\r\nburden in exercising the duties conferred upon them by\r\nthe Member States, under Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nI would like to elaborate on three points. How can\r\nwe really implement Article 24 and reform the\r\nrelations between the Security Council and the general\r\nmembership? How does the issue of Security Council\r\nreform relate to a peacekeeping reform, as initiated by\r\nthe Brahimi report? And, finally, how can we reform\r\nour own working culture and not let the principle of\r\nconsensus stop all reform efforts?\r\nOne of the most obvious innovations in the\r\nCouncil’s recent practice has been overlooked by the\r\nreport, namely, the re-introduction of private meetings.\r\nI am not a psychologist who can give the Assembly an\r\nexplanation for that. Since October of last year, I have\r\nbeen writing to the Presidents of the Security Council\r\non a regular basis to ask them to allow non-members of\r\nthe Council to participate in the Council’s deliberations\r\nin cases where their interests are especially affected.\r\nLast January, I submitted a memorandum containing\r\nproposals on how such meetings could include a wider\r\nmembership of the United Nations and yet remain\r\nconfidential in character. That memorandum on the\r\nformat and modalities of private meetings has been\r\ndiscussed in the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform. Some of the memorandum’s\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nideas were incorporated into this year’s report of the\r\nWorking Group.\r\nThe changes in the Security Council’s procedures\r\nover the last year were quite significant. Instead of\r\nautomatically coming together behind closed doors, the\r\nCouncil has moved towards being more open to the\r\ngeneral membership. In some cases, interactive debates\r\nhave taken place. In other cases, however, the non-\r\nmembers of the Council were not allowed to participate\r\nin the discussion, as provided for in the Council’s\r\nprovisional rules of procedure. I believe this\r\ndevelopment should receive closer attention in the\r\nfuture.\r\nStatistics indicate that the tendency of the\r\nSecurity Council to meet behind closed doors is\r\ncontinuing. We deeply regret this, and I would like\r\nwholeheartedly to endorse everything that has been\r\nsaid about this problem by my Indian colleague.\r\nTherefore, two questions remain. How can parties\r\ninvolved be included prior to, and in, the actual\r\nconsultations, and how can third parties with vital\r\ninterests be enabled to participate in informal Security\r\nCouncil meetings? What types of procedures are\r\navailable on a case-by-case basis without appearing\r\narbitrary? This is not just a procedural or legal issue; it\r\nis, rather, a fundamental one. The more that especially\r\naffected countries are heard, the more legitimacy the\r\nCouncil’s decisions will have and the more weight its\r\nresolutions will carry.\r\nThat brings me to my next point, namely, the\r\nBrahimi report and its linkage to the issue of Security\r\nCouncil reform. Among other things, the Brahimi\r\nPanel recommends that\r\n“The Security Council should leave in draft\r\nform resolutions authorizing missions with\r\nsizeable troop levels until such time as the\r\nSecretary-General has firm commitments of\r\ntroops and other critical mission support\r\nelements, including peace-building elements,\r\nfrom Member States.” (A/55/305, para. 64 (b))\r\nAt a later stage, the reports states that\r\n“The Secretariat must tell the Security\r\nCouncil what it needs to know, not what it wants\r\nto hear, when formulating or changing mission\r\nmandates, and countries that have committed\r\nmilitary units to an operation should have access\r\nto Secretariat briefings to the Council on matters\r\naffecting the safety and security of their\r\npersonnel, especially those meetings with\r\nimplications for a mission’s use of force.”\r\n(ibid., para. 64 (d))\r\nThat is exactly the point that my Indian colleague has\r\nemphasized.\r\nThe Security Council should not only hear those\r\nMember States, but also take their views into\r\nconsideration, the latter being the more important part\r\nof this communication exercise between the Security\r\nCouncil and the general membership. No Article of the\r\nCharter needs to be changed or amended for the\r\nCouncil to involve more Members in its deliberations\r\nand decision-making process on peacekeeping\r\nmissions. As we all know, the Security Council is the\r\nmaster of its own procedures. That means that\r\nincreasing the participation of a wider portion of the\r\nmembership is a matter of political will.\r\nAfter all, we are talking about the future of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping,  which is the United\r\nNations fundamental task, as well as the future of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. If there is no reform of the\r\nSecurity Council and its working methods,\r\npeacekeeping reform will remain incomplete.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly stressed in his\r\nspeech before the General Assembly on 12 September\r\nthat\r\n“Consensus is highly desirable, but it need\r\nnot mean waiting for absolute unanimity on\r\nevery sub-clause among 189 Member States. The\r\nminority, often a very small minority, should not\r\nwithhold its consent unreasonably. ... We can no\r\nlonger afford to operate always at the level of the\r\nlowest, and slowest, common denominator.”\r\n(A/55/PV.10, p. 2)\r\nIn practice, however, we do have to wait for that\r\nslowest common denominator, and important reform\r\nprojects are being held hostage by a minority even\r\nthough we can no longer afford to allow that to happen.\r\nThis year’s deliberations of the Working Group\r\non Security Council reform once again made it quite\r\nclear that because of the attitude of a minority it was\r\nnot possible to agree on any substantial chapter in this\r\nyear’s report. The valuable efforts of both of our Vice-\r\nChairmen, who had worked out an extremely\r\nwell-balanced draft on general observations, were\r\nfrustrated. Together with many other reform-minded\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\ncountries, we would have preferred the original version\r\nof the Vice-Chairmen’s proposals. Fortunately, that\r\noriginal version has become an annex to the report, so\r\nthe Bureau’s assessment of the problems and\r\nperspectives of the reform debate are reflected in its\r\nentirety. I would recommend that everybody take a\r\nclose look at this excellent paper and get an idea where\r\nwe stand and where we might go from here.\r\nWe need not only a reform of the Security\r\nCouncil and of United Nations peacekeeping, but also\r\nof our own working methods. Seven years of reform\r\ndebate are enough. Both the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council should reform their working culture\r\nand methods and breathe life into the words they\r\nproduce. Action, not words, are needed.\r\nMr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAt the outset, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the report he has submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its present session. It contains\r\ncomprehensive and detailed information about what the\r\nSecurity Council did in a working year that straddled\r\ntwo centuries. Today I take this opportunity to share\r\nmy views on several issues, and on United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in particular.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are an important means\r\nby which the United Nations fulfils its obligations with\r\nrespect to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. On the one hand, the past year witnessed an\r\nincrease in both the number and the scale of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. On the other hand,\r\nsuch operations failed to yield the expected results in\r\nSierra Leone and other places, highlighting to some\r\nextent the fact that such operations do indeed have\r\nproblems that need to be solved immediately. We\r\nbelieve that it takes more than the political will of\r\nMember States and sufficient resources to strengthen\r\nthe peacekeeping capacity of the United Nations. The\r\nSecurity Council should be more rational and more\r\npurpose-specific and case-specific in making decisions\r\nin this field.\r\nFirst, better communication and consultation with\r\nthe troop-contributing countries is crucial. Whether it\r\nis a matter of authorizing the deployment of a new\r\npeacekeeping mission or of amending the mandate of a\r\ncurrent operation, the views of the contributors must be\r\nheeded and respected. Consultations should be\r\nconducted on a regular basis among the members of the\r\nSecurity Council, troop-contributing countries and the\r\nSecretariat on the situation on the ground, conditions of\r\nthe deployed troops and other matters. Such\r\ncommunication can be carried out at a variety of levels;\r\nit can take place at United Nations Headquarters in\r\nNew York and/or in the field, where the peacekeeping\r\ntroops are deployed. The form of such communication\r\nshould also be varied with a view to ensuring its\r\neffectiveness and efficiency.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council must try to do a\r\nbetter job of pooling expertise and information in the\r\ndecision-making process and in the review process. In\r\nthat regard, on the one hand, the Secretariat should\r\nstrengthen its capacity to collect, collate and analyse\r\ninformation so that it can supply the Security Council,\r\nin a timely manner, with accurate, comprehensive and\r\nreliable information concerning the situation on the\r\nground and concerning specific needs for deployment.\r\nThe Security Council, for its part, should also work\r\nhard to develop more channels of communication and\r\nto listen to information from a wider range of sources.\r\nIn recent years, some of the Security Council missions\r\nto the sites of peacekeeping operations have been\r\nsuccessful. They have helped the Security Council gain\r\na comprehensive understanding of given situations and\r\nformulate solutions accordingly. The Security Council\r\nshould therefore continue to do this in the future.\r\nThirdly, the Security Council should substantially\r\nimprove its cooperation with the regional organizations\r\nand countries concerned to address hot-spot issues with\r\na view to safeguarding regional stability. Those\r\nregional organizations and countries can often be\r\npivotal to the solution of such issues, which, when\r\nmishandled, can easily spill over to neighbouring\r\ncountries and to the entire region. Therefore, when\r\nseeking solutions to such issues, the Security Council\r\nmust have in mind the big picture of the whole region,\r\nmust attach due importance to the views of the regional\r\norganizations and countries concerned and must\r\nstrengthen cooperation with them in carrying out\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nTo sum up, coordination among the Security\r\nCouncil, troop-contributing countries, the Secretariat’s\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, relevant field\r\nmissions and the regional organizations and countries\r\nconcerned should be further strengthened. There should\r\nbe an established regime and mechanism for such\r\ncoordination, and it should become a regular practice\r\nof the Security Council. It takes joint efforts by all\r\nMember States to strengthen the peacekeeping capacity\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nof the United Nations. The report (A/55/305) of the\r\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations chaired by\r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi has provided Member States with\r\na good basis for discussion. It is our hope that those\r\nrecommendations in the report that enjoy broad\r\nagreement and that are easy to carry out can be\r\nimplemented as soon as possible.\r\nIn the past year, the Security Council has held\r\nquite a number of discussions on hot-spot issues in\r\nAfrica. It remains a major challenge, however, for the\r\nCouncil to find timely, effective and durable solutions\r\nto those issues. We hope that the declaration (Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1318 (2000), annex) adopted at the\r\nSecurity Council summit meeting last September,\r\nespecially those parts that relate to Africa, will be\r\nimplemented in an earnest and effective way.\r\nLast year, when adopting its resolutions on the\r\narms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea and on the\r\ndiamond embargo against Sierra Leone, the Security\r\nCouncil for the first time explicitly set time-frames for\r\nthe embargoes. By doing so, the Council achieved a\r\nmajor breakthrough in its sanctions work, because it\r\nrightly responded to the call of a vast number of\r\nMember States.\r\nWe have always supported the Security Council’s\r\nefforts to improve its working methods, transparency\r\nand efficiency so that it can better carry out its\r\nresponsibilities with respect to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security on behalf of all\r\nMember States. The Chinese delegation is ready to\r\ncontinue, along with other delegations, to work\r\nconstructively to that end.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\ntake this opportunity to thank Member States for the\r\nsupport they showed by electing Colombia as a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod 2001-2002. Colombia assumes that challenge\r\nwith a great sense of responsibility, and will maintain\r\npositions that conform strictly to the United Nations\r\nCharter and its fundamental principles.\r\nAfter looking through the report before us on the\r\nwork of the Security Council (A/55/2), I should like to\r\nfocus on three issues. The first is the methodology of\r\nthe report. We recognize and applaud the\r\nimprovements made in the content of the report and in\r\nthe methodology used to prepare it. However, as we\r\nhave already said on other occasions, a major problem\r\nremains: The inadequacy of information for States that\r\nare not members of the Security Council, owing to the\r\nhigh number of informal meetings. In the period under\r\nreview, according to the report, there were 144 formal\r\nmeetings. But 194 informal consultations also took\r\nplace, of which non-members know nothing except for\r\nwhat each country is able to find out for itself. That is a\r\nclear example of how ill-informed are States not part of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nColombia understands that certain meetings must\r\nbe held in private owing to the sensitivity of the issues\r\nunder discussion, but there are occasions on which we\r\nbelieve that there is room for openness, for the sake of\r\ntransparency in the decisions taken. Problems of\r\ninternational peace and security are of equal concern to\r\nmembers and to non-members of the Council. For that\r\nreason, we stress the need to reform current practice, or\r\nat least to consider alternative ways to incorporate the\r\nopinions and viewpoints of non-member States that can\r\ncontribute innovative ideas. Open debates have been an\r\nimportant step forward, but it is necessary to explore\r\nother mechanisms to increase the transparency of the\r\nSecurity Council’s methods and procedures.\r\nSecondly, as concerns the mandate of the Security\r\nCouncil, we believe that we need to evaluate the\r\nCouncil’s competence. According to Article 24 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, the Security Council has\r\n“primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security”.\r\nThere are “new” thematic items on the agenda\r\nthat are not clearly linked to the maintenance of peace\r\nand security and that are usually discussed at least once\r\na month in the Council. These issues have their own\r\ndiscussion forums, and therefore, when they are\r\nconsidered by the Security Council as they are now,\r\nthey have an impact on the actions taken by other\r\nUnited Nations bodies. These are very important issues\r\non the world’s agenda and directly affect a great\r\nnumber of countries, and we therefore deem it\r\ninappropriate that they be excluded from wider\r\nconsideration, unless this procedure genuinely benefits\r\nthe Council\u0027s work.\r\nThirdly, in the past year there has been growing\r\ngeneral dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the\r\npeace operations set up by the Security Council. A lack\r\nof clarity in the mandates of some missions is not only\r\ndamaging the Organization’s credibility but also\r\nleading to the loss of human lives. This must change.\r\nWe cannot continue to excuse the Organization for\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nflaws that are repeated daily. The Security Council has\r\nthe responsibility of reviewing this practice. We cannot\r\nkeep sending Blue Helmets to areas of conflict as a\r\nsign of hope for civil society, when the truth is that\r\nperhaps they do not represent the best way to achieve\r\npeace.\r\nIf a mission’s mandate is not stated clearly, with\r\nenough human, economic and logistical resources to\r\nensure its success, it is better not to create such a\r\nmission. We cannot repeat the same mistakes such as\r\nthe well-documented ones in Rwanda, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and Sierra Leone, to mention just a few.\r\nAll of this is made even worse when we take into\r\naccount the existing serious shortcomings in preventive\r\nactions.\r\nFor this reason, we believe that the Organization\r\nis facing a very important challenge today. The report\r\nsubmitted by the high-level Panel on United Nations\r\nPeace Operations, contained in document A/55/305,\r\nmakes a series of recommendations for improving\r\nthese operations. In order to adopt and adapt these\r\nrecommendations, the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Secretariat must work together. It\r\nwould be pointless for each organ to present individual\r\nconclusions, as this would only further postpone the\r\nnecessary reform of peacekeeping operations.\r\nThere are some who argue that this issue falls\r\nmore within the purview of the Council than that of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It is clear that a great number of\r\ndecisions concerning peace operations do fall within\r\nthe purview of the Council. However, we must keep in\r\nmind that these decisions affect a great number of\r\npeople and that there is therefore a need for open\r\ndebate leading to a broadly representative consensus, in\r\norder not to further delay the reform we so desire.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize how\r\nimportant Security Council reform is for Colombia.\r\nThe issues we have raised today make clear the need to\r\ntransform the Security Council into a more\r\nrepresentative body whose practices are transparent\r\nenough to secure the greatest possible trust and whose\r\nmembers can contribute in a more balanced way to its\r\ndecisions.\r\nMr. Vento (Italy): I would like at the outset to\r\ncongratulate the Permanent Representative of Namibia,\r\nAmbassador Andjaba, this month’s Security Council\r\nPresident, on his clear and detailed presentation of the\r\nCouncil’s annual report to the General Assembly. I also\r\ncommend the Secretariat for its excellent preparatory\r\nwork.\r\nThe report is a document that is invaluable to the\r\nnecessary interaction between the Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, pursuant to the recommendations of\r\nArticle 15 of the Charter. As always, however, there is\r\nroom for improvement. That is why I reiterate the wish\r\nmy delegation has expressed in previous years that the\r\nreport, rather than being a mere catalogue of meetings,\r\nresolutions and presidential statements, should be more\r\nsubstantial and analytical, which would allow us to\r\nbetter assess the work of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects and effects, in the areas of both peace and\r\nresources. That is why I am in agreement with many of\r\nthe remarks that have been made by the representative\r\nof India.\r\nThis annual occasion provides the entire\r\nmembership of the General Assembly with an\r\nopportunity for collective reflection. I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to share my thoughts on the work\r\nof the Security Council in the fundamental area of\r\npeace and security.\r\nThere has been a sharp and healthy increase in\r\nthe Security Council’s activities in the past 12 months.\r\nThe Council has had to address some of the most\r\nsensitive and difficult crises in the world, authorizing\r\nfive new peacekeeping missions of great complexity\r\nand importance, namely in Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra\r\nLeone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea. At the same time, it has\r\nreinforced the operation in southern Lebanon. Italy is\r\nactively involved in five of those six missions.\r\nConsidering the marked rise in interventions decided\r\non by the Council and the enormous consequences of\r\nthis renewed activism for all Members of the\r\nOrganization, we all have a right to question the way\r\nthese mandates were adopted and to ask whether\r\ndifferent and more effective means might have been\r\nused to achieve peace.\r\nThese same questions fuelled the report by the\r\ngroup of experts led by the former Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Algeria, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, which the\r\ncompetent bodies — the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat — must now\r\nassess for action. Another question we must ask is\r\nwhether authentic and timely conflict prevention\r\nefforts have been made by the Security Council,\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\ndrawing on the full means indicated under Chapter VI\r\nof the Charter.\r\nIn the past year the United Nations has taken on\r\ngrowing responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace, following an era in which the\r\nthreat of intersecting vetoes had paralysed its ability to\r\nact. This became possible thanks not only to a growing\r\nconvergence of views among the members of the\r\nSecurity Council, particularly the five permanent\r\nmembers, but also, and above all, to the common\r\ncommitment and the joint contributions of the members\r\nof the General Assembly, because in many cases\r\nimportant players in crisis management and conflict\r\nresolution are members of the General Assembly but\r\nnot necessarily of the Security Council.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity is, in fact, a collective responsibility to be\r\nshouldered by the international community as a whole.\r\nSome countries, because of their influence, strategic\r\nand geographic position as “front-line countries”, offer\r\ncontributions decisive to the political and stabilization\r\nprocesses at the heart of peace agreements, the\r\nprerequisite for any United Nations intervention. Other\r\ncountries, whose numbers are growing, have deployed\r\ntheir contingents of troops and police forces on\r\nmissions deliberated by the Security Council. The new\r\n“complex” missions in Kosovo and East Timor, which\r\ninvolve a form of international administration of the\r\nterritories, require magistrates, judges, prison and\r\nborder guards and civil administrators from countries\r\nthat belong to different geographic groups.\r\nItaly participates actively in this renewed\r\ncommitment, both through its specialized personnel\r\ninvolved directly in United Nations missions and\r\nthrough the action conducted by the European Union in\r\nclose connection with the United Nations. This is why\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recent talks in Strasbourg and\r\nBrussels, aimed at strengthening cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the European Union in the\r\ncrucial area of conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement, should be strongly supported. This\r\nprocess was already implicit when the European Union\r\nHigh Representative for the Common Foreign and\r\nSecurity Policy, Javier Solana, made a statement on the\r\nBalkan crisis at the Security Council meeting last\r\nJune — an important first step towards enhanced\r\ncollaboration between the United Nations and the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe need for the rapid development of\r\npeacekeeping operations decided on by the Security\r\nCouncil, and their substantial evolution in recent years,\r\nhas made the United Nations financial crisis even more\r\nglaring. The exponential increase in the peacekeeping\r\nbudget has placed a growing burden on all United\r\nNations Members, especially the top contributors. In\r\nthe current budget year, for example, Italy is paying\r\napproximately $110 million to finance peacekeeping\r\noperations that the Security Council decided on in\r\ncomplete autonomy. We are thus in favour of a review\r\nof the scale of assessments for peacekeeping that will\r\nendow this fundamental sector with greater stability\r\nand resources and also compensate for the persistent\r\nstate of financial uncertainty.\r\nThe tragic experiences of Sierra Leone, and,\r\nearlier, of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda, have\r\nforced us to engage in a profound reflection on the\r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations decided on by\r\nthe Security Council. In his report to the Millennium\r\nAssembly, the Secretary-General bravely faced up to\r\nthe grave failures of United Nations missions, some of\r\nthem recent, and underlined the need to increase the\r\nefficiency and legitimacy of the Council.\r\nFirst of all, the Security Council must do more in\r\nthe way of conflict prevention and adopt credible\r\nmandates, after having listened to all the interested\r\ncountries, organizations and parties that can contribute\r\nto the resolution of crisis situations. In the future, we\r\nwill be counting on an improvement in the Council’s\r\ndecision-making procedures, and a full accounting of\r\nthem in the annual report we are discussing today.\r\nThere is a widespread feeling that non-members\r\nof the Council should also be consulted in its decision-\r\nmaking process. Our Organization’s future success in\r\nrestoring peace to some of the most tormented parts of\r\nthe world will depend, to an increasing extent, on the\r\nability of Council members to open up to outside\r\ncontributions. The recommendations in the Brahimi\r\nreport are particularly useful in this regard: we need to\r\nwork so that active interaction with countries that\r\ncontribute to peace operations takes place during the\r\nconsideration of a new mandate and in cases where\r\nmandates have to be modified in response to events on\r\nthe ground.\r\nWe need to reform the Council’s working\r\nmethods. Last year, there was an encouraging increase\r\nin open debates and public meetings.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nI should like to say one other thing about the\r\nreform of the Security Council. The final Declaration\r\nof the Millennium Summit properly recommended\r\ncomprehensive reform in all aspects, thus rejecting\r\nquick fixes or short-cuts on key issues such as the veto,\r\nthe equality of Member States and effectiveness. That\r\nis why we do not see how an increase in the permanent\r\nmembership would improve the decision-making\r\nprocess of the Security Council — quite the contrary,\r\nsince the Security Council usually works at the level of\r\nthe lowest common denominator among the permanent\r\nfive members as a result of the power of the veto or the\r\nsimple threat of the veto. That is the rule the Security\r\nCouncil follows. We are therefore puzzled by the\r\ncriticism of the way in which the Working Group on\r\nreform works. There is minority rule and majority rule,\r\nbut I think the need to reform the Security Council is\r\ntoo serious an issue for us to allow it to be dealt with in\r\na way that promotes the interests of certain countries\r\ninstead of the membership in general.\r\nThe credibility of our Organization in the\r\nmaintenance of peace depends on its ability to adjust to\r\nnew challenges and circumstances. While every\r\nMember State must strive to strengthen the crisis-\r\nmanagement capacities of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of peacekeeping and to reform its financial\r\narrangements, the Security Council has special\r\nresponsibilities. The most important of these\r\nresponsibilities regards decision-making. This is a\r\ncommitment that, pursuant to Article 24 of the Charter,\r\nis conferred upon the members of the Security Council\r\nby the general membership, which, in return, expects\r\nthorough, effective implementation.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): I should like\r\nfirst of all to convey my delegation’s congratulations to\r\nmy brother and friend, Ambassador Martin Andjaba of\r\nNamibia. As President of the Security Council for\r\nOctober, he introduced with his usual clarity and\r\nprecision the annual report of the Security Council\r\ncovering the period 16 June 1999 to 15 June 2000.\r\nIt is true that the report is long, but it is full of\r\nfacts and figures and provides a complete picture of the\r\nimportant role of the Security Council in managing the\r\nmany situations that pose a threat to international peace\r\nand security in the world.\r\nMember States have a legitimate interest in the\r\nactivities of the Council and in the General Assembly\r\ndebate on the report of the Council, as provided for in\r\nArticle 15 and Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter.\r\nThis debate certainly provides a special\r\nopportunity to review the work of the Council and to\r\nconsider ways of maintaining or enhancing the\r\ncredibility and effectiveness of that central body in\r\norder to create the necessary synergy between it and\r\nthe other principal organs of the Organization. We\r\nbelieve that this discussion of the report is useful for\r\nboth the Security Council and the General Assembly\r\nbecause it helps to ensure perfect coordination and\r\neffective interaction.\r\nIt is clear from reading the report that once again\r\nthe Council has had a particularly busy year. During\r\nthe reporting period, it held 144 formal meetings,\r\nadopted 57 resolutions, issued 38 presidential\r\nstatements and held 194 informal consultations of the\r\nwhole.\r\nI wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to all\r\nCouncil members for the high quality and relevance of\r\nthe report, which offers us a timely assessment of their\r\nlevel of commitment to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe report is also the outcome of the efforts made\r\nby Council members and the Secretariat to fulfil the\r\ndesire of countries members and non-members of the\r\nCouncil to make the work of that strategic body more\r\ntransparent.\r\nThe need for greater transparency in the work of\r\nthe Security Council has met with great progress in\r\nrecent years, and we appreciate the now well-\r\nestablished practice of briefing non-members of the\r\nCouncil. I also wish to stress and welcome the more\r\nfrequent use of open debates on items on the Council’s\r\nagenda, as well as the positive initiatives taken by the\r\nPresidents to organize open meetings on specific\r\nquestions of concern to the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nDuring this year, the Council has held thematic\r\ndebates on peacekeeping, on security and post-conflict\r\npeace-building, on the promotion of peace and security,\r\non humanitarian aid to refugees in Africa, on children\r\naffected by armed conflict, on the protection of\r\ncivilians affected by armed conflicts, on small arms\r\nand light weapons, on the responsibility of the Security\r\nCouncil for the maintenance of peace, on the role of\r\nthe Council in the prevention of armed conflicts, on the\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nhumanitarian aspects of items before the Security\r\nCouncil, and, finally, on an equally important issue, the\r\nquestion of sanctions.\r\nClearly, these stimulating debates are of special\r\nimportance for the non-members of the Council,\r\nbecause it means that they can make an important\r\ncontribution to the consideration of the items on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda. This is why my delegation supports\r\nthis innovation, even as we remain convinced of the\r\nneed to improve its practical effectiveness by holding\r\nmore frequent open meetings on specific items, leading\r\nto concrete action.\r\nAgain this year, as in previous years, the report of\r\nthe Security Council gives special attention to crises in\r\nAfrica, the continent which currently has the greatest\r\nnumber of conflicts on the Council’s agenda. I refer to\r\nAngola, Burundi, Ethiopia/Eritrea, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone,\r\nand so forth. Given the unstable political situation in\r\nthe continent, which is a source of concern for the\r\nentire international community, the Council has made\r\ncommendable efforts to contain these conflicts. It can\r\nnever be repeated too often that unless there is peace\r\nand stability, there can be no sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nIn this regard, I wish to welcome the many\r\ninitiatives on Africa undertaken by the Council during\r\nthe reporting period and beyond. I wish to refer to the\r\nmemorable days of 24 and 26 January 2000, and during\r\nwhich the situation in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo was considered, and during which, under the\r\naegis of the United States presidency, the Security\r\nCouncil had a high-level debate in the presence of\r\nPresidents Chiluba of Zambia, Chissano of\r\nMozambique, Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, dos Santos of Angola, Mugabe of Zimbabwe,\r\nMuseveni of Uganda and Bizimungu of Rwanda, as\r\nwell as the Secretary-General of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and Sir Ketumile Masire, the\r\nfacilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue.\r\nThe taking of timely, courageous decisions\r\nvalidated the work of that meeting, in particular the\r\nreaffirmation of the commitments of the main\r\nprotagonists of the Congolese crisis to work together\r\nfor the strict implementation of the provisions of the\r\nLusaka Agreement and for the immediate deployment\r\nof the United Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The international\r\ncommunity as a whole welcomed that United States\r\ninitiative and hoped that it would lead to new\r\ndynamism and thus a political solution to the conflict\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nIt is in this same context that we also welcomed\r\nthe dispatch of the Security Council mission to the\r\nGreat Lakes region to build on the outcome of the\r\nJanuary meeting. It is true that that field mission did\r\nnot bring about a major breakthrough in the Congolese\r\ncrisis; however, it did help to enhance the Council’s\r\ncredibility by opening the way for the process of\r\ndemilitarizing the city of Kisangani and making it\r\nsafer. At that time, Kisangani was a hotbed of acts of\r\nviolence that caused hundreds of civilian casualties.\r\nCloser to us geographically, even if this event is\r\nnot technically covered by the report, I wish to point\r\nout that the recent mission of a delegation of the\r\nSecurity Council to the subregion of West Africa is\r\nanother illustration of this determination on the part of\r\nCouncil members to undertake specific actions in the\r\nfield to restore peace and security in areas torn by\r\nconflict and civil war.\r\nFinally, among the most outstanding activities of\r\nthe Council during this year was the meeting held in\r\nparallel with the Millennium Summit where heads of\r\nState of countries members of the Council discussed\r\nprimarily problems of security and peace in Africa.\r\nIn the interest of peace and development in the\r\nAfrican continent, the Security Council should start\r\nconsidering ways to give Africans the capacity to\r\nstrengthen their own capacity for peacekeeping, and\r\nparticularly their capacity for prevention in order to\r\ndeal with crisis situations. I have used the word\r\n“capacity” repeatedly because I wish to stress this\r\nneed. All too often, the Council has been accused,\r\nrightly or wrongly, of reacting to African problems and\r\nof being slow to take proper preventive action. My\r\ndelegation believes that a rapid reaction mechanism\r\nshould be designed and put into place jointly by the\r\nCouncil and the regional organizations, on the basis of\r\na partnership that would strike a balance between their\r\nrespective roles and responsibilities.\r\nAfrican leaders, the Organization of African\r\nUnity and the subregional organizations, such as the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States, the\r\nSouthern African Development Community and the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States, have\r\ndecided to include in their field of action the\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nprevention and security mechanisms to deal with the\r\nmany African conflicts.\r\nAnother aspect of the work of the Council to be\r\nconsidered is the need to improve the working methods\r\nof that central body. In this regard, I am pleased to note\r\nthat there is already broad consensus on such essential\r\npoints as the participation of non-members in Council\r\nmeetings, the programme of work of the Council and\r\nthe briefings convened by the President of the Council\r\nfor the benefit of non-members and troop-contributing\r\ncountries. It now remains to go further and to\r\ninstitutionalize these trends so that from now on the\r\npromotion of international peace and security is based\r\non a revitalized, more effective and more transparent\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe must finally end a deplorable trend that\r\nprevents the Council from fulfilling its mandate — that\r\nof Member States and regional organizations taking\r\ncoercive action without the Council’s authorization or\r\nacting unilaterally, invoking the right to humanitarian\r\nintervention. This trend should be discouraged by\r\nasserting the Council’s competence in the areas defined\r\nby the Charter, so that the Security Council is in step\r\nwith the changing world and so that it can demonstrate\r\nimagination and determination in the maintenance of\r\nglobal peace, security and stability.\r\nPrecisely since it functions solely in the service\r\nof peace, the Council — to enhance the authority and\r\ncredibility with which it carries out its essential and\r\nfundamental mission of preserving global peace and\r\nsecurity — needs the unequivocal support of its\r\nmembers and of the other members of the international\r\ncommunity. In this regard, the valuable contribution\r\nthat the Brahimi report could make to the Council’s\r\nexercise of its mandate should be stressed. It seems to\r\nme that, were they to be adopted, some of the relevant\r\nrecommendations contained in that report could\r\nconsiderably improve the work of the Council — for\r\nexample, in the future management of peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to extend heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to the representatives of Mauritius,\r\nIreland, Norway, Colombia and Singapore, which have\r\njust been elected to the Security Council.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We thank Ambassador Martin Andjaba of\r\nNamibia for introducing the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly. We also\r\nthank the other members of the Security Council and\r\nthe Secretariat for the work they did to prepare this\r\nlarge amount of material.\r\nWithout failing to recognize its value as part of\r\nthe institutional memory of the Council, we reiterate\r\nthat this kind of information is far from what we hope\r\nto receive and what we need. The annual report is not a\r\nprivilege granted to the Member States represented in\r\nthis Assembly; it is an obligation clearly established in\r\nArticles 15 and 24 of the Charter. We have the\r\nlegitimate right to expect a proper accounting from the\r\nbody to which we have entrusted with the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and which, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the Charter, acts on behalf of all the\r\nMember States.\r\nIn 1996 the General Assembly adopted resolution\r\n51/193, with the precise objective of ensuring that the\r\nreports of the Security Council to the Assembly would\r\nprovide a timely, substantive and analytic account of its\r\nwork. However, most of the proposals contained in this\r\nresolution continue to be ignored. The Assembly\r\nshould therefore undertake a consideration of the\r\nreasons for this non-compliance and take action to\r\nremedy the situation.\r\nThe General Assembly still does not receive the\r\nspecial reports that should be submitted by the Council,\r\nin accordance with Article 24, paragraph 3, of the\r\nCharter. The presentation of such reports would in no\r\nway prejudice the work of the Council. On the\r\ncontrary, it would be beneficial for all. It would enable\r\nthe Assembly to make useful recommendations on the\r\nwork of the Council and make possible active and\r\ncontinuous relations between the two bodies —\r\nsomething that is lacking at present.\r\nGreater transparency in the work of the Council is\r\nurgently needed. In an increasingly interdependent\r\nworld, decisions taken by that body have a growing\r\neffect, directly or indirectly, on all Member States. In\r\naddition, when those decisions are implemented, the\r\nfinancing comes from all the Member States and not\r\nsolely from those States taking the decisions.\r\nIn the specific case of the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean Group, we must express appreciation for the\r\nconstant efforts made by Argentina and Jamaica to\r\nkeep the countries of the region as informed as possible\r\non the work of the Council. But such efforts alone are\r\nnot sufficient.\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nAccording to its own rules of procedure, the\r\nCouncil must meet in public unless it is decided\r\notherwise. However, the rule has become the\r\nexception. The Council continues to carry out most of\r\nits work behind closed doors, despite the fact that the\r\nmajority of Member States have emphatically and\r\nrepeatedly stated that this is unacceptable. The\r\nCouncil’s provisional rules of procedure are not even\r\napplied during these closed meetings.\r\nWe welcome the fact that, although such meetings\r\nremain the exception, over the past year there has been\r\nan increase in the number of open meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council. This trend should be maintained, but\r\nthe objective is not merely to have an increase in\r\nquantity; open meetings should provide non-Member\r\nStates a real opportunity to make an effective\r\ncontribution to the work of that body. Too often we\r\nwitness lengthy open debates in the Security Council\r\nthat ultimately have no effect on the resolutions or\r\npresidential statements adopted, since the texts have\r\nbeen agreed on previously in closed meetings among\r\nthe Council members.\r\nSo long as the current practice remains in place,\r\nthe annual report of the Council must include detailed\r\ninformation on the discussions held behind closed\r\ndoors. At present we are told only how long the\r\nmeetings lasted. In general the monthly reports of the\r\nCouncil President offer little or no analysis. The\r\npresentation of these reports must become the rule, and\r\nwe must establish parameters for the minimum\r\ninformation that must be contained in them.\r\nWe are concerned by the trend in the Security\r\nCouncil to discuss issues and adopt texts ruling on\r\nquestions of a general nature — activities that far\r\nexceed the responsibilities entrusted to that body by the\r\nCharter. This approach is being used with increasing\r\nfrequency by the Council in order to legitimize its\r\nactions in the economic, social and humanitarian\r\nspheres.\r\nThe Council must not assume tasks entrusted to\r\nthe General Assembly and other United Nations bodies.\r\nInstead, its efforts should be focused on achieving\r\ngreater coordination and cooperation between it and the\r\nAssembly and other bodies, as established by the\r\nCharter. As to the increasingly complex mandates\r\nadopted by the Council, there can be no excuse for its\r\nfailure to adhere strictly to the principles of respect for\r\nsovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs\r\nof States.\r\nWe welcome the inclusion in the Council’s report,\r\nfor the second consecutive year, of the reports of the\r\nsanctions Committees. At the same time, we reiterate\r\nthat these Committees’ working methods are affected\r\nby the same distortions evidenced in the Security\r\nCouncil’s meetings and need to be reviewed. The\r\nmeetings of sanctions Committees must, as a rule, be\r\nopen and when they are held behind closed doors on an\r\nexceptional basis, detailed information on the\r\ndeliberations must be provided in the Council’s reports.\r\nThe countries affected must have the full right to\r\nparticipate in the discussions of the sanctions\r\nCommittees.\r\nSanctions regimes cannot become punitive\r\ninstruments against some countries based on the\r\nhegemonic interests of certain Council members, as,\r\nunfortunately, now occurs in well-known cases. It is\r\nparadoxical that the very countries that are determined\r\nto preserve sanctions regimes which reflect their own\r\nnational interests and affect innocent civilians are also\r\namong those that try to convince us of the value of so-\r\ncalled humanitarian intervention. This is a clear\r\nexample of hypocrisy and double standards.\r\nWhile the Council’s annual report reflects the fact\r\nthat most of the items on its agenda involve Africa,\r\nattention and available resources also remain focused\r\non that continent. The undeniable truth is that Africa\r\nhas more armed conflicts today than any other\r\ncontinent. More than one third of African countries are\r\npresently or have recently been involved in conflicts. It\r\nis clear that, beyond rhetoric, we need practical action\r\nand the necessary political will to find solutions to the\r\ngrowing and pressing problems of an entire continent,\r\nwhich are due primarily to their colonial past and to the\r\ncurrent poverty, marginalization and underdevelopment\r\nin which African nations are mired.\r\nWe are convinced that many of the problems that\r\nwe have addressed will be satisfactorily resolved only\r\nif there is complete reform of the Security Council,\r\nwhich is undoubtedly the most delicate and urgent task\r\nof United Nations reform as a whole. It should not,\r\nhowever, be cited as an excuse for maintaining the\r\nstatus quo while such reforms are being developed. As\r\nclear proof of the genuine will to move forward, we\r\nhope that the comments and suggestions that have been\r\nmade and will continue to be made in this debate will\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nbe taken duly into account by the members of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil): I thank Ambassador\r\nMartin Andjaba for his presentation of the Security\r\nCouncil report for the period June 1999 to June 2000. I\r\ntake this opportunity also to congratulate the newly\r\nelected members of the Council: Colombia, Singapore,\r\nIreland, Norway and Mauritius.\r\nThis annual debate should serve the purpose of\r\ndiscussing how decisions of the Council could be taken\r\nwith broader communication with Member States. We\r\nsupport initiatives aimed at enhancing accountability\r\nand transparency in the work of the Security Council.\r\nIndeed, the work of the Security Council must be\r\nbrought closer to the general membership. In this\r\nrespect, we commend the holding of daily briefings by\r\nthe presidency for their quality and level of detail. The\r\nincreasing practice of open briefings, open debates and\r\nmore frequent private meetings is also an encouraging\r\nsign. The sanctions Committee’s reports could be\r\ndebated in open meetings. We encourage outgoing\r\nPresidents to brief Member States on the work of the\r\nSecurity Council during their term and to circulate their\r\nassessments. Resolutions and presidential statements\r\nshould be preceded by broader discussions and better\r\nreflect the general sense of open debates.\r\nThe report of the Security Council summarizes a\r\nyear of intense activities, some success stories and,\r\nunfortunately, many reasons for concern. Africa\r\nremains the main focus of Council actions and\r\ndiscussions. The recurring violence in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, the difficulties in implementing\r\nthe peace process in Sierra Leone, the continuation of\r\nthe civil war in Angola and the territorial dispute\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea are powerful reminders\r\nthat the United Nations still has a long way to go\r\nbefore our goal of a more stable international scenario\r\ncan be achieved.\r\nWe are encouraged by the positive prospects in\r\nAngola, since the Government’s forces are well able to\r\ncontain the military challenge posed by UNITA in\r\ndefiance of the Lusaka Protocol. We also welcome the\r\nfact that, since the United Nations Office in Angola\r\nbecame operational, there has been a noticeable\r\nimprovement in the flow of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe Middle East, especially after the events of\r\nrecent weeks, is a source of grave concern. We\r\nwelcome the adoption of resolution 1322 (2000) and\r\nstress the need for the Council to respond to possible\r\noutbreaks of violence in the region. Brazil also\r\nreaffirms that resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)\r\nmust be the bases of a just and lasting solution to the\r\nArab and Israeli conflict.\r\nAlso concerning the Middle East, the Council,\r\nalthough far from showing unity, was able to adopt a\r\nresolution on Iraq in the period covered by the report.\r\nWe hope to see peace and stability taking root in\r\nthe Balkans. Despite recent positive developments in\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Security\r\nCouncil’s attention to the region is no less crucial than\r\nit was before. We reaffirm our support for the work of\r\nthe United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo\r\nand our call for the local population to develop a\r\nculture of tolerance and multiculturalism. We note,\r\nhowever, that the implementation of resolution 1244\r\n(1999) was also a highly divisive issue for the Council.\r\nThe situation in East Timor is of close interest to\r\nBrazil. The leadership of the Secretary-General and the\r\ndetermined action of the Council during all stages of\r\nthe crisis were essential to assert the message that the\r\nTimorese people’s democratic option for self-\r\ndetermination could not be reversed by force. East\r\nTimor has to complete several transitions: from\r\noppression to self-determination and independence;\r\nfrom economic backwardness to sustainable\r\ndevelopment; and from fear and terror to stability and\r\ntranquillity. The complex task of administering East\r\nTimor’s transition to independence is being conducted\r\nwith great competence by Under-Secretary-General\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello and his team. Acts of violence\r\nand infiltration by militia groups in East Timor should\r\nnot be allowed to disrupt the construction of the new\r\nState.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are increasingly\r\ncomplex and numerous. The Security Council must be\r\nattentive to the current efforts to reflect on how to\r\nrespond to new peacekeeping mandates. The Brahimi\r\nreport offers a valuable framework on how to build\r\nupon lessons learned from mistakes of the past. The\r\ncourageous reports on Rwanda and Srebrenica should\r\nbe standing references. The challenge is, as the\r\nBrahimi report itself points out, the establishment of\r\nmandates that are clear, credible and achievable.\r\nFinancial resources, mandate and political will must\r\nconverge to make every United Nations peacekeeping\r\ninitiative feasible.\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nSanctions must be a tool for the normalization of\r\ninternational relations, not a collective punishment\r\nimposed on the population of a targeted country.\r\nSanctions are an extreme measure that is justifiable\r\nonly when alternatives for a peaceful settlement of the\r\ndispute have failed altogether. They should be\r\nproportional to the objectives and limited to precise\r\ntargets, bear in mind the humanitarian impact and the\r\neffect on third parties, and contain clear terms of\r\nduration and termination. We praise the efforts of\r\nAmbassador Fowler in strengthening the\r\nimplementation of the sanctions regime against\r\nUNITA. We are also looking forward to the results of\r\nthe Security Council’s working group on how to\r\nimprove the effectiveness of United Nations sanctions\r\nestablished in April.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, our leaders set the\r\npriorities for the agenda of the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council. Tolerance, democracy, development,\r\nhuman rights and humanitarian principles are at the\r\ncore of what is to be achieved by the international\r\ncommunity. The foundation of international law, upon\r\nwhich our quest for the Millennium Summit goals\r\nshould be based, lies in the United Nations Charter. We\r\nreaffirm our view that the Security Council is the only\r\nbody whose legitimacy to impose enforcement\r\nmeasures is based on a universally accepted\r\ninstrument. The alternative to legitimacy provided by\r\nthe United Nations Charter is an unstable order in\r\nwhich the goals established at the Millennium Summit\r\nwill be more distant.\r\nThe leaders of the world called for intensified\r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council to make it more representative,\r\neffective and legitimate. The Council’s present\r\ncomposition reflects events that occurred 55 years ago.\r\nThe decision-making process in the Council must\r\nreflect the collective will of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. Otherwise, the Council will\r\nhave a very modest role — if any at all — in our search\r\nfor a durable solution to international crises.\r\nMr. Valdez Carrillo (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe Peruvian delegation wishes to thank Ambassador\r\nMartin Andjaba, Permanent Representative of Namibia\r\nand current President of the Security Council, for\r\nsubmitting the annual report of that body (A/55/2),\r\ncovering the period from 16 June 1999 to 15 June\r\n2000. We have received this report in accordance with\r\nArticle 24 of the United Nations Charter, and we\r\nwelcome the dialogue that can be established, through\r\nthis debate, between two of the most important bodies\r\nof the system.\r\nThe maintenance of peace and security is one of\r\nthe basic purposes of the Organization, reflected in\r\nArticle 1 of the Charter, and it is also an ongoing desire\r\nand concern of nations. The Security Council is the\r\nbody responsible for this duty, acting on behalf of the\r\nMembers of the Organization. Members have a\r\nlegitimate interest in the follow-up of achievements\r\nand progress, as well as problems and setbacks. That\r\ninterest must be acknowledged and reciprocated.\r\nPeru welcomes the efforts for openness made\r\nover the past year through the holding of more open\r\nmeetings of the Council on various topics of interest,\r\nand hopes that this attitude will continue to prevail in\r\nthe future so that the Security Council will become\r\nmore transparent in its work and will consider the\r\npoints of view of the majority of the States of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nPeru also welcomes the first steps to establish an\r\nongoing, direct dialogue between the Security Council\r\nmembers and troop-contributing countries on the basic\r\naspects of peacekeeping operations, such as the\r\nmandate, financial base and human resources of every\r\nmission. My delegation also considers that every\r\nmember elected to that organ must make an ongoing\r\neffort to disseminate and update information to its\r\nrespective region, as the delegation of Argentina does\r\nthrough weekly meetings at its Mission and the\r\ndelegation of Jamaica does at the meetings of the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean Group.\r\nRecent years, and specifically the period\r\ncorresponding to this report, have posed enormous\r\nchallenges in terms of planning and implementation by\r\nthe Organization because of the size and importance of\r\ndeployed peacekeeping operations. These new realities\r\nhave arisen from internal conflicts whose destabilizing\r\nforce involves or spreads to neighbouring countries,\r\nnecessarily leading to an adjustment of traditional\r\npeacekeeping operation duties. This situation has\r\nproduced the emergence of new concepts and the\r\nexpansion of traditional functions in mandates,\r\nstemming from deliberations and decisions that leave\r\nthe great majority of the States of the Organization\r\noutside the debate on the best way to face these new\r\nrealities.\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nMoreover, we have recently witnessed\r\ndiscussions within the Security Council on aspects that\r\nfall within the jurisdiction of other forums of the\r\nOrganization, such as the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the General Assembly. It has thus become more\r\ncommon to restrict to a small group of countries the\r\ndebate on concepts that, without an appropriate\r\nframework, can lead to intervention and interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of States. For example, there is no\r\nclear basis of action and interpretation for so-called\r\nhumanitarian intervention, which would justify the use\r\nof force due to serious violations of humanitarian law\r\nand human rights. Questions arise about who will\r\ndetermine when these violations occur, and by what\r\nstandards and why this discussion does not take place\r\nwithin a more participatory forum.\r\nWe cannot ignore that the mandate conferred by\r\nthe Charter on the Security Council responded to a\r\nreality in which relations between States prevailed in\r\nthe international arena. Therefore, the Charter alludes\r\nto those relations when it deals with measures to\r\nprevent threats to peace and security.\r\nPeru has also carefully followed the debates in\r\nthe Security Council on the prevention of armed\r\nconflict. Positions have been expressed in these\r\nmeetings promoting a broad, unilateral expansion of\r\nthe concept of the causes of conflicts and of the very\r\nconcept of security, incorporating factors of a political\r\nnature and of government management.\r\nPeru favours preventive action that deals with the\r\nmain causes of conflicts, particularly well-known\r\neconomic factors such as poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. However, it believes that this\r\nsubject must be framed within the principles and norms\r\nof the Charter of the Organization and must result from\r\nongoing dialogue with the competent bodies of the\r\nsystem, such as the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThat body has a basic role to play in efforts to\r\nprevent conflicts. It understands that items on poverty\r\nand development are of high priority within the\r\nframework of the United Nations — the “promotion of\r\nthe economic and social advancement of all peoples”,\r\nas is mentioned in the Charter. These priorities have\r\nbeen postponed despite having the majority support of\r\nMember countries and being in keeping with the\r\npreventive effort promoted by the Security Council.\r\nWe also believe that it could be difficult for the\r\nSecurity Council, in fulfilling the responsibilities\r\nassigned to it under the Charter, to achieve the desired\r\nresults unless there is also a process allowing for the\r\nstrengthening of the General Assembly.\r\nPeru is convinced that it is essential to strengthen\r\nthe role and effectiveness of the General Assembly, the\r\nmost representative and democratic body of the\r\ninternational system, in order for it to regain a decisive\r\nrole in managing and deciding on those matters over\r\nwhich it has legitimate and direct jurisdiction. These\r\ninclude issues related to international peace and\r\nsecurity, as stipulated in Article 11 of the Charter. This\r\nfunction must be performed in order to determine the\r\nframeworks of collective security, which, as I have\r\nmentioned, is faced with situations of internal conflict,\r\nfor which the Security Council was not designed,\r\nespecially in those cases in which consequences and\r\ndecisions of universal application may arise.\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly is not only\r\ncapable of consideration, reflection and\r\nrecommendations in these matters, but that the need for\r\nthe fulfilment of this role is more evident than ever\r\nbefore. There is no better place than this to negotiate,\r\nexpress and agree consensually on new concepts that\r\nwill be applied later by the Security Council.\r\nThis forum also contributes to the safeguarding of\r\nthe basic principles of relations between States and the\r\nestablishment of a common basis for action that derives\r\nfrom the participation of all States. We reaffirm that the\r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations is the\r\nrelevant forum within the Organization to deal with all\r\nmatters relating to such operations.\r\nPeru received with interest the statement of the\r\nSecurity Council during the Millennium Summit. We\r\nbelieve that most aspects dealt with therein form a\r\nbasis for a general consensus among States. We\r\nemphasize, among other things, the reaffirmation of the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, the search for\r\ngreater effectiveness in peacekeeping operations, the\r\nstrengthening of the security of the Organization’s\r\npersonnel in the field, the expansion of consultations\r\nwith the troop-contributing countries and the\r\nimportance of reintegrating former combatants into\r\nsociety.\r\nThese same aspects have been particularly\r\nemphasized in the report of the Panel of experts,\r\npresided over by the former Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Algeria, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, which has led\r\nto an intense debate in various forums of the\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nOrganization and on which Peru will submit its opinion\r\nin the relevant bodies.\r\nHowever, we believe that the Security Council\r\nstatement lacked specific reference to studying\r\nsanctions regimes, as was mentioned by some Security\r\nCouncil delegations during its debate. The purpose of\r\nsuch reviews will be to ensure that sanctions do not\r\nhave their greatest impact — in some cases,\r\npermanently — on a civilian population that ends up\r\nbeing the direct victim of the sanctions imposed on a\r\nparticular Government.\r\nOn the other hand, Peru is pleased with efforts to\r\nanalyse the economic causes of conflicts, in connection\r\nwith the role played by rebel groups and third States in\r\ntheir illegal exploitation of natural resources. We\r\nbelieve that this is a very important factor in sustaining\r\ncurrent conflicts, and it must be addressed. For its part,\r\nthe Peruvian delegation has informed the appropriate\r\nnational authorities of the specific provisions of the\r\nSecurity Council pertaining to this situation.\r\nMy delegation has followed, and will continue to\r\nfollow attentively, all these matters regarding the\r\nSecurity Council. We are convinced of the fundamental\r\nrole assigned to the Council by the Charter of the\r\nOrganization. That is why we would like for it to\r\nachieve its full potential, for we acknowledge that the\r\nsuccess of its efforts means the success of the\r\nOrganization and, consequently, the achievement of the\r\ndesire for peace and security of all our peoples.\r\nMr. Buallay (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): I would\r\nlike to thank our colleague Ambassador Andjaba, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Namibia and President of\r\nthe Security Council for the month of October, for his\r\npresentation of the report of the Security Council for\r\nthe period June 1999 to June 2000. It is also my\r\npleasure to congratulate Singapore, Mauritius,\r\nColombia, Norway and Ireland on their election to the\r\nCouncil for 2001 and 2002.\r\nOur delegation has examined the document\r\ncontaining the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We pay tribute to the effort that has\r\ngone into preparing the report, and we would like to\r\nreaffirm the importance of the role of the Security\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Bahrain spared no effort to play an effective\r\nrole during its membership in the Security Council,\r\nfrom January 1998 to December 1999 — a period that\r\nwitnessed many raging conflicts, from Africa to Europe\r\nto Asia. My country was able to witness at first-hand\r\nthe importance of the role entrusted to the Security\r\nCouncil in ensuring stability in the world. However, we\r\nwere likewise able to see at first-hand that there were\r\nmany obstacles standing in the way of the Council’s\r\nachieving its purpose that is organically linked to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It may\r\nbe appropriate here to touch upon some of those\r\nobstacles.\r\nFirst, given the political map of the international\r\ncommunity, there is the question of the inequitable\r\nrepresentation in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. It goes without saying that this map is\r\ndifferent today from what it was at the time the Charter\r\nwas established, in 1945. This is true whether one\r\nlooks at numbers, geographical distribution or the\r\nbalance of political power. Some say that increasing\r\nthe number of members in the Council in the interest of\r\nequity might affect the efficiency of the Council’s\r\nwork. While that might be true to a certain extent, it is\r\nnot sufficient reason to justify having 15 members of\r\nthe Council represent 189 Member States of the United\r\nNations.\r\nSecondly, there is the issue of the lack of\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council, in particular\r\nwhere the concept of collective security is concerned.\r\nThat concept presupposes the participation of the\r\nlargest possible number of members of the\r\ninternational community, including members of the\r\nCouncil itself. It is true that there has been greater\r\naccess in recent years by other members of the United\r\nNations to the work of the Council. But there has not\r\nbeen enough openness to enable non-member States of\r\nthe Council to participate effectively. This applies\r\nespecially to members of the Organization whose\r\ncountries are facing the same problems as those being\r\ndiscussed by the Council.\r\nThirdly, there is a difference in the ways that the\r\npermanent and non-permanent members of the Council\r\ndeal with various issues. We are not here to discuss the\r\nissue of veto power; but perhaps the right of veto and\r\nthe fact that one group has permanent membership\r\nstatus and the other does not, serve to engender within\r\nthe Council two different views and two methods of\r\nwork on the same issue.\r\nFourthly, there is the issue of the crisis faced by\r\npeacekeeping operations — which are entrusted to the\r\nCouncil — whether with regard to logistical, financial\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nor organizational aspects of those operations. Despite\r\nthe fact that each peacekeeping operation has its own\r\nparticularities, there is apparently no clear\r\norganizational methodology or planning in place for\r\nthose operations. As a result, decisions on resolutions\r\nto deploy United Nations peacekeepers stem from\r\nconsiderations reflecting the views and analyses of\r\ncertain members of the Council, in particular those of\r\nthe most influential members.\r\nFifthly, the sanctions regimes established by the\r\nCharter of the Organization, whose imposition and\r\nimplementation have been entrusted to the Council,\r\nhave negative consequences when they are imposed for\r\na long period of time and turn the acute suffering of\r\npeoples into chronic suffering. There is a need for a\r\nstandardized system that would mitigate negative\r\neffects on populations as months and years go by.\r\nMoreover, we believe that the imposition of sanctions\r\nshould not be comprehensive; rather, sanctions should\r\nbe confined to specific areas. To give one example,\r\nsanctions should not prevent people from fulfilling\r\nreligious obligations that may require travel outside\r\ntheir countries, simply because the sanctions prohibit\r\ntravel outside the country under sanctions. This matter\r\nrequires radical review, in accordance with the\r\nguidelines established by the non-permanent members\r\nof the Council in 1999, which can serve as a basis for\r\nsuch a review.\r\nI would like to say a few final words about the\r\nMiddle East situation and where that question stands in\r\nthe Council. The Middle East problem is closely linked\r\nto international peace and security and has resulted in\r\nmore than one war. Although the problem has been on\r\nthe international scene since 1948, it is not on the\r\nagenda of the Council. The recent tragic events in the\r\nregion, which have led to over 100 Palestinian deaths\r\nas a result of an Israeli act of provocation, should make\r\nus realize the importance of this question. It is high\r\ntime for the Security Council once again to take up this\r\nissue that was the subject of much discussion by the\r\nCouncil in the past and led to the adoption of a number\r\nof resolutions. Of particular importance are resolutions\r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973), whose implementation has\r\nbeen pending for quite some time.\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): The\r\ndelegation of Viet Nam wishes to thank His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Martin Andjaba, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Namibia and President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the month of October, for his\r\nsuccinct and informative presentation of the report of\r\nthe Security Council (A/55/2). His statement surely\r\nhelped us to understand more fully the contents of the\r\ncomprehensive report, which is rich in factual material,\r\nas well as the work of the Council during the period\r\nunder review. I wish to congratulate the Security\r\nCouncil secretariat on the hard work that went into the\r\nproduction of the report.\r\nThe Millennium Summit showed that the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations has the intense\r\naspiration to enhance the authority of the General\r\nAssembly, the organ in which every Member is\r\nrepresented. The Millennium Declaration also\r\nunderlined the importance of the task of further\r\nstrengthening the relationship between this body and\r\nthe Security Council. In that context, the Assembly’s\r\nconsideration of the report of the Security Council\r\ntoday is of special significance. We hope that what we\r\ndo today will contribute to improving the work of the\r\nCouncil and will thus make a worthy contribution to\r\nthe maintenance of world peace and security in the\r\ncoming years.\r\nWe have carefully studied the report and wish to\r\nunderline the positive developments in the work of the\r\nCouncil in the period from 16 June 1999 to 15 June\r\n2000. It is quite noticeable that there has been greater\r\ntransparency in the meetings conducted by the Council\r\nduring that period. The general membership has long\r\nbeen very energetic in calling for greater transparency\r\nin the conduct of the business of that body. We have\r\nseen a greater number of public meetings and prompt\r\nbriefings by Presidents of the Council to\r\nrepresentatives of States not members of the Council. It\r\nis noteworthy that in recent years, non-members of the\r\nSecurity Council have been increasingly engaged in the\r\ndiscussions of important issues before the Council.\r\nThere is no doubt that such participation is essential for\r\nthe success of the Council’s activities. It is a welcome\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe welcome the prompt actions of the Security\r\nCouncil during the period in resolving crises in many\r\nregions throughout the world. In that regard, we wish\r\nthe Security Council would apply the same approach to\r\nthe current Middle East crisis. We earnestly hope that a\r\nsolution will be found to the crisis and that the peace\r\nprocess will be put back on track.\r\nWe also welcome the fact that the parties\r\nconcerned in given issues have been invited to take\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\npart in some of the consultations of the Council. Their\r\nparticipation has helped the Council to produce more\r\nbalanced and impartial solutions to the issues under\r\ndiscussion. They have brought greater, valuable inputs\r\ninto the work of the Council.\r\nReading the report and following the work of the\r\nCouncil, we recognize that the Council has made great\r\nefforts to conduct a larger number of public meetings\r\nconsisting of thematic debates. These debates have\r\nfocused on many issues that relate to the maintenance\r\nof world peace and security, such as the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict; protection for humanitarian\r\nassistance to refugees; children and armed conflict; and\r\nothers. This initiative has received an earnest response\r\nfrom States not members of the Council. We hope that\r\nthis procedure will continue, because it is our\r\nconviction that it will help the Council to better equip\r\nitself to deal with crises when they occur in the future.\r\nIn that regard, we wish to caution members that\r\nthe question of so-called humanitarian intervention\r\nraises many delicate and controversial questions. These\r\ninclude a fundamental principle of the United Nations\r\nCharter, namely State sovereignty. We hold that the\r\nSecurity Council should not attempt to expand its\r\npurview beyond what is authorized under the Charter,\r\nbecause that would in time diminish the roles of other\r\ncompetent organs of the United Nations; here, the\r\nGeneral Assembly is a case in point. The general\r\nmembership of the United Nations, for instance, will\r\nnot accept the Council indulging in efforts to establish\r\ncertain norms.\r\nWe wish to take this opportunity to stress that the\r\nSecurity Council should do its utmost to avoid private\r\nmeetings. It is our view that private meetings should be\r\nthe exception rather than the norm, as they are now.\r\nThe world community today cannot accept the practice\r\nby which the Council holds formal meetings only to\r\nconduct thematic debates or to inform the general\r\nmembership of the work it has done in secret.\r\nAs regards the decision-making mechanism of the\r\nCouncil, my delegation is particularly concerned at the\r\nfact that, although the veto power was not used during\r\nperiod under review, some Council members still resort\r\nto the threat of using it, thus making the work of the\r\nCouncil less effective. Because of this practice, many\r\nmeetings and consultations of the Council are\r\nprolonged into the wee hours, and awaited solutions\r\nhave not been forthcoming. The Council’s impasse in\r\nreviewing ongoing sanctions regimes is a good case in\r\npoint.\r\nMy delegation calls on the Council urgently to\r\nreview the sanctions regimes that are under the\r\nauthority of the Council. Viet Nam believes that\r\nsanctions should be the last resort, that their scope and\r\nduration should be clearly defined and that great\r\ncaution should be exercised before they are imposed.\r\nMost important of all, they should never be used\r\nindefinitely. In this connection, we call on Council\r\nmembers to urgently review and lift all the sanctions\r\nimposed upon Iraq, taking into account their\r\ndebilitating effects on the Iraqi people.\r\nWe note with pleasure the continued practice of\r\nincluding in the report monthly assessments by former\r\nPresidents of the Council. With these voluntary\r\nassessments, the report of the Security Council is more\r\nanalytical and insightful. It helps non-member States to\r\nhave a better and deeper understanding of the work of\r\nthe Council. We also commend the fact that the report\r\nincludes information about the work of the Council’s\r\nsubsidiary bodies, particularly the sanctions\r\ncommittees. We hope that this good example will be\r\ncontinued in future reports of the Council.\r\nIn a nutshell: on the one hand, due recognition\r\nshould be given for improvements in the working\r\nprocedures and the business of the Council. On the\r\nother hand, we are sorry to note that the Council, more\r\noften than not, has not proved to be the useful tool of\r\nall States Members of the United Nations. Some members\r\nof the Council, particularly certain permanent\r\nmembers, still act only on their own behalf rather than\r\non behalf of the general membership as is stipulated in\r\nthe Charter. It is high time that this was corrected,\r\nunless we want the Council to be irrelevant to current\r\nworld realities.\r\nViet Nam has on various occasions called for an\r\nexpanded and reformed Council. We strongly believe\r\nthat urgent efforts should be exerted to make the\r\nCouncil truly representative and accountable and its\r\nwork truly democratic and legitimate. We have also\r\nexpressed our support for the curtailment of the veto\r\npower, as an interim measure.\r\nBefore concluding my statement, I wish to extend\r\nour warmest congratulations to Colombia, Ireland,\r\nMauritius, Norway and Singapore on their election to\r\nmembership of the Council last week. We strongly\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nbelieve that those countries will make worthy\r\ncontributions to the work of the Council.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): My delegation is grateful\r\nto the President of the Security Council, Ambassador\r\nMartin Andjaba of Namibia, for his precise, objective\r\nand factual presentation of the Council’s fifty-fifth\r\nannual report to the General Assembly. The\r\nconsideration of this report, pursuant to Articles 15 and\r\n24 of the Charter of the United Nations, affords the\r\nAssembly an opportunity to examine all aspects of the\r\nwork of the Council — substantive as well as\r\nprocedural — and to make constructive critiques and\r\nrecommendations for further improvements in the work\r\nof the Council. It also provides for more effective\r\ncoordination and interaction between the Assembly and\r\nthe Council.\r\nMy delegation is gratified at the ongoing efforts\r\nto improve the format and content of the annual report\r\nof the Council. In its current format, the report now\r\ncontains a fuller and much more accurate record of the\r\nCouncil’s activities, beyond a mere compilation of\r\nalready published documents, as was the case in the\r\npast. The inclusion in the report of brief descriptions of\r\nthe Council’s informal consultations of the whole,\r\ninformation on the work of the Council’s various\r\nsubsidiary bodies, and assessments by the Presidents of\r\nthe Council has made the report more substantive and,\r\nhopefully, more useful to the larger membership of the\r\nOrganization. A particularly welcome development is\r\nthe trend towards a more in-depth reporting on the\r\nwork of the Council by its Presidents, which is a\r\ndeparture from past practice. This trend towards greater\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council, which was\r\ninitiated largely by the elected members of the Council,\r\nwill, hopefully, become a permanent feature in the\r\nworking methods of the Council.\r\nHowever, further improvements may be\r\nnecessary in order to make future reports of\r\nthe Council more comprehensive and useful to the\r\ngeneral membership. General Assembly resolution\r\n51/193 of 1996 contains a number of important and\r\nconstructive recommendations for such improvements.\r\nAt the same time, discussions in the Assembly and in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform have also addressed this matter and have\r\nmade constructive suggestions. One of these\r\nrecommendations was the need for submission of\r\nspecial reports of the Council, as provided for under\r\nArticles 15 and 24 of the Charter. We believe that the\r\nsubmission to the Assembly, when necessary, of such\r\nspecial reports highlighting major critical issues before\r\nthe Council, will contribute to even closer interaction\r\nand coordination between the two principal organs of\r\nthis Organization. There have been situations in the\r\nrecent past in which the submission of such special\r\nreports would have been extremely valuable to States\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nIt is also gratifying to note that the working\r\nmethods of the Council represent an ongoing process\r\nthat continues to evolve. This is largely due to the ever-\r\nincreasing calls from the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as from within the Council\r\nitself, for more openness, enhanced transparency and,\r\nmost important of all, increased effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil. Wide-ranging and constructive discussions are\r\ncontinuing, with the objective of finding ways and\r\nmeans of enabling the Council to more effectively\r\ncarry out its primary responsibility in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership of the Organization.\r\nA number of practical improvements to the\r\nCouncil’s procedures have indeed been effected and\r\nhave been welcomed by the larger membership. These\r\ninclude, the regular briefings given by the President of\r\nthe Council, among others, to non-member States on\r\nissues discussed during the informal consultations of\r\nthe Council, as well as the increased frequency of open\r\ndebates and open briefings, with the participation of\r\ninterested Member States that are not members of the\r\nCouncil. It is to be hoped that these briefing sessions\r\nwill be fully utilized by the larger membership.\r\nThe convening of the so-called thematic debates\r\nin the Council has become a useful forum for more\r\neffective and broader consultations between Council\r\nmembers and interested Member States not members of\r\nthe Council, as well as relevant intergovernmental\r\norganizations and experts from the Secretariat and\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies and other\r\ninternational bodies. These thematic debates provide an\r\nopportunity for the participants to address complex and\r\ncross-cutting issues relating to the overall question of\r\npeace and security. They contribute to enriching the\r\nCouncil’s understanding of complex peace and security\r\nissues and to improving its decision-making process.\r\nWhile the Council’s informal consultations have\r\ntheir purpose and are, in many ways, indispensable,\r\ntransparency demands that there should be more\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nfrequent public or formal meetings of the Council. It is\r\ngratifying to note that during the period covered by the\r\nreport, we have seen an increase in the number of such\r\nmeetings of the Council. Also, increasingly, the\r\nCouncil now receives briefings from the Secretariat or\r\nthe Special Representatives of the Secretary-General in\r\nrespect of existing United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations in the format of the open meetings to which\r\nthe larger membership of the Organization is invited.\r\nThe Council has also resorted to the more frequent\r\nconvening of so-called private formal meetings, with\r\nthe participation of concerned or directly affected\r\nStates, and at times with others that have special\r\ninterests in such private meetings. Such private\r\nmeetings allow for candid exchanges of views between\r\nCouncil members and representatives of concerned\r\nStates that may not be possible in an open setting. In\r\nthis sense, the so-called private meetings of the\r\nCouncil do serve a purpose.\r\nWith the more frequent use of the format of\r\nprivate meetings of the Council, the mechanism of\r\nthe Arria formula has reverted to what it was\r\noriginally intended to be, namely a mechanism\r\nfor informal exchanges of views between Council\r\nmembers and individuals representing non-\r\ngovernmental organizations or institutions that could\r\ncontribute to a better understanding by Council\r\nmembers of particular issues under that body’s\r\nconsideration. We are pleased with the more frequent\r\nuse of private meetings of the Council, as provided for\r\nunder its rules of procedure, as well as with the proper\r\nuse of the Arria formula.\r\nEven as the Council’s working procedures\r\ncontinue to evolve, there should be more focused\r\nattention in addressing the most contentious aspect of\r\nthe Council’s decision-making process, that is, the\r\nanachronistic institution of the veto. Experience has\r\nshown, as recently as late last week, that the Council’s\r\nability to deal with pressing international crises\r\npromptly and effectively is affected by the veto or the\r\nthreat of use of the veto. Pending its ultimate demise,\r\nthere is a need to regulate and restrict the use of the\r\nveto to ensure a more democratic functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council. We urge those members of the\r\nCouncil with veto power to manifest the necessary\r\npolitical will in this regard. We are pleased with the\r\ngreat restraint shown by the majority of the permanent\r\nmembers with respect to the use or threat of use of the\r\nveto.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the more frequent\r\ndispatch of Council missions to conflict situations,\r\nsuch as those that were sent to East Timor, Kosovo, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, and, more recently, to Sierra Leone. Even\r\nthough these missions may not result in major\r\nbreakthroughs in the resolution of the conflict, they\r\nafford Council members a better understanding of the\r\nreal situation on the ground and a better appreciation of\r\nthe nature, complexity and dynamics of the conflict.\r\nThe deeper insights that such missions bring to bear in\r\nCouncil discussions of specific conflict situations can\r\nonly result in enhancing the decision-making process in\r\nthe Council. The missions sent to Africa, namely to the\r\nGreat Lakes region, to Ethiopia and Eritrea and to\r\nSierra Leone, are particularly important to the Council\r\ngiven its preoccupation with the conflict situations on\r\nthe continent. They will result in more informed and\r\nfocused discussions on the conflicts and on the role of\r\nthe Council in resolving them.\r\nClearly, the success of any Council action in\r\naddressing conflict situations around the globe is\r\ndetermined by many factors, including the cooperation\r\nand political will of the parties concerned to achieve\r\npeace. But the effectiveness and credibility of the\r\nCouncil in carrying out its responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security largely\r\ndepend on determined efforts — prompt, united and\r\nconcrete action — by the Council itself. Clearly, this\r\nwill require political will on the part of Council\r\nmembers, which, if not forthcoming, will result in\r\nparalysis in the Council, thereby blocking any concrete\r\naction by the Council. Needless to say, this will\r\nundermine they very credibility of the Council in the\r\neyes of the international community.\r\nThe lack of political will on the part of the\r\nCouncil can inadvertently result in a selective approach\r\nin addressing conflict situations. This should be\r\navoided. The Council must deal with conflict situations\r\nin an even-handed manner, irrespective of where the\r\ncrisis occurs. A non-selective approach by the Council\r\nis vital to ensure its credibility and prestige, as well as\r\nthe necessary support for its actions.\r\nSanctions remain a legitimate instrument of the\r\nCouncil in giving effect to its decisions with regard to\r\ncertain States or parties to a conflict. While\r\nrecognizing that this enforcement mechanism is\r\nprovided for in Article 41 of the Charter, my delegation\r\nstrongly believes that sanctions are an exceptional\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nmeasure that should be resorted to only in extreme\r\nsituations, after all peaceful means of influencing the\r\nbehaviour of the States, Governments or other\r\nauthorities concerned have been exhausted. Sanctions\r\nshould be imposed only after careful consideration of\r\ntheir objectives and should be properly targeted, with\r\nspecified time-frames, with clear provisions for their\r\nlifting and in full cognisance of their possible impact\r\non third States.\r\nUpon the imposition of sanctions, the Council\r\nshould establish a clear mechanism for an assessment\r\nof the impact of the sanctions. The Council should\r\navoid imposing blanket or comprehensive sanctions on\r\nan entire country because of the likely debilitating\r\neffects that that would have on the populace. Sanctions\r\nshould be lifted as soon as possible once they have\r\nserved their purpose or are no longer pertinent to the\r\nsituation. My delegation is encouraged by the current\r\nefforts in the Council to address, in a comprehensive\r\nmanner, all issues pertaining to sanctions, and to move\r\nin the direction of more focused and targeted sanctions.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to take this\r\nopportunity to warmly congratulate the newly elected\r\nnon-permanent members of the Council, namely,\r\nColombia, Ireland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore.\r\nMalaysia pledges its full support and cooperation to\r\nthem as they prepare to take their seats on the Council\r\nin January next year. We trust they will build on the\r\nachievements made thus far and forge new\r\nbreakthroughs in enhancing further the transparency\r\nand effectiveness of the Council during their tenure.\r\nWe are confident that they will do so. We wish them\r\nevery success.\r\nMr. Satoh (Japan): At the outset, I would like to\r\ncongratulate the five countries — Colombia, Ireland,\r\nMauritius, Norway and Singapore — that were elected\r\nto non-permanent membership of the Council last\r\nweek. The palpable excitement which filled this Hall\r\non election day was testimony to the importance\r\nMember States attach to the Council’s work. I wish to\r\nconvey to the newly elected members, and to all the\r\nmembers of the Security Council, assurances of Japan’s\r\nfull support as they discharge their enormous\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nI also wish to express my appreciation to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Mr. Martin Andjaba,\r\nAmbassador of Namibia, for his introduction of the\r\nreport of the Security Council on its work from June\r\n1999 to June 2000. This is indeed a useful document,\r\nand I very much appreciate the enhanced monthly\r\nassessments made by the former Presidents,\r\nparticularly the detailed assessments of the work of the\r\nCouncil made by the non-permanent members during\r\ntheir tenures.\r\nIt has become increasingly apparent in recent\r\nyears that the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity requires a comprehensive approach, one that\r\naddresses not only political and military but also\r\neconomic and social dimensions, which are the root\r\ncauses of conflicts. The open debate chaired by United\r\nStates Vice-President Al Gore last January on the\r\ndevastating impact of AIDS in Africa is perhaps the\r\nmost telling example of the Council’s wider approach\r\nto peace and security issues.\r\nThe need to expand the perspective from which\r\nwe consider international peace and security is also\r\nevident in the recent multifaceted mandates of\r\npeacekeeping operations, which, in addition to military\r\nand police activities, often extend to nation-building\r\nand include activities in the area of development and\r\ngovernance. The doubling of the total budget of\r\npeacekeeping operations in the past two years is also a\r\nreflection of that need. Against this background, the\r\ncooperation of the entire international community in\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security is becoming\r\never-more essential. It is largely through the support\r\nand cooperation of non-member States, which provide\r\npersonnel as well as financial resources for\r\npeacekeeping and peacemaking activities, that the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council are implemented. Our\r\nexperiences in East Timor, Kosovo and Sierra Leone\r\nare cases in point.\r\nI heartily support the recent increase in the\r\nnumber of so-called open debates and open briefings.\r\nThe need to engage interested non-members in the\r\nCouncil’s deliberations and to have their views\r\nreflected in the Council’s decisions has been repeatedly\r\nstressed in the course of the deliberations of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council reform.\r\nHowever, I must point out that non-members are not\r\ngiven the opportunity to express their views at open\r\nbriefings. Moreover, the considerations underlying the\r\nCouncil’s decisions on peacekeeping operations are not\r\nalways clear to non-members. I would therefore like to\r\nsuggest that every effort be made to hold open debates\r\nrather than open briefings, so that non-member\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\ncountries are given the opportunity to ask questions\r\nand to make their views known.\r\nI also welcome the Council’s recent practice of\r\nholding informal consultations with the participation of\r\ntroop contributors. But that is not enough. I would like\r\nto bring to the attention of the Assembly the statement\r\nby the President of the Security Council of 28 March\r\n1996 and note by the President of the Security Council\r\nof 30 October 1998, contained in documents\r\nS/PRST/1996/13 and S/1998/1016 respectively, which\r\npoint out that the Council should continue the existing\r\npractice of inviting Member States which make special\r\ncontributions to peacekeeping operations other than\r\ntroops and civilian police, such as contributions to trust\r\nfunds, logistics and equipment.\r\nI have to point out that this practice has not been\r\nfollowed. The exclusion from those consultations of\r\ncountries making such contributions runs counter to the\r\ntrend towards greater transparency and accountability.\r\nWhile we support the steps the Security Council\r\nhas taken to improve its interaction with the rest of the\r\nUnited Nations membership, these measures will not in\r\nthemselves enhance the Council’s legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness. In order to make the Council truly\r\neffective in tackling the increasingly complex\r\nchallenges it faces, its composition must be\r\nfundamentally reformed to reflect the realities of\r\ntoday’s international community. Let me, therefore,\r\nstress again my conviction, which I believe is shared\r\nby a majority of countries, that both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent membership of the Council must be\r\nexpanded, and that both developing and developed\r\ncountries must be included in the expanded permanent\r\nmembership.\r\nThe fact that more than 150 countries stressed the\r\nneed to reform the Security Council in the course of the\r\nMillennium Summit and in the subsequent general\r\ndebate is a reflection of the growing frustration among\r\nthe United Nations membership over the slow progress\r\nthat has been made in that regard. Indeed, as stated in\r\nthe Millennium Summit Declaration, we should\r\nintensify our efforts to realize genuine reform to ensure\r\nthat the Security Council can effectively carry out its\r\ncrucially important work in the years to come.\r\nMr. Niehaus (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nConsideration of the Security Council’s annual report\r\nis one of the main activities of the General Assembly.\r\nWe would like to thank the Ambassador of Namibia,\r\nfor his excellent introduction.\r\nUndoubtedly, the Security Council is the\r\nOrganization’s most visible body in the international\r\npublic’s eye, given the emergency situations in which it\r\nis called upon to play a leading role. However, we must\r\nnot forget that the decisions of the Security Council are\r\nnot exclusively the decisions of its members, but rather\r\nthose of the international community as a whole.\r\nUltimately, the Council is acting on behalf of all\r\nMembers of this Organization. For this reason, it is\r\npossible to say today that both the Security Council as\r\na whole and each of its members are presenting\r\naccounts to those whom they represent.\r\nAt the same time, the other Members of the\r\nOrganization have an obligation to consider the work\r\nof the Council conscientiously in order to determine if\r\nthe Council is effectively complying with its\r\nresponsibilities and faithfully representing our\r\ninterests.\r\nUnfortunately, events over the past year have not\r\nprovided a very positive image of the Security\r\nCouncil’s work. In Sierra Leone hundreds of United\r\nNations peacekeepers were taken hostage. In Timor the\r\nOrganization’s personnel fell victim to cold-blooded\r\nmurder. In the Congo, cities have been bombed and\r\ninnumerable massacres have taken place, while in the\r\nHorn of Africa we have witnessed an incomprehensible\r\nwar, despite the last-minute personal diplomatic efforts\r\nof a number of Security Council members.\r\nThe responsibility for these setbacks seems to be\r\nclear. As revealed in the Brahimi report:\r\n“Most occurred because the Security Council and\r\nthe Member States crafted and supported\r\nambiguous, inconsistent and under-funded\r\nmandates and then stood back and watched as\r\nthey failed.” (A/55/305, para. 266)\r\nIf we are to trust this report, we must conclude that the\r\nCouncil has repeatedly failed in its work.\r\nNevertheless, my country recognizes that\r\ncoordinated action by the international community,\r\nthrough this Organization, is the sole mechanism that\r\nhumanity can rely on to face the perils that lie in\r\nambush. For that reason, we cannot lose faith in the\r\nSecurity Council; rather, we must strengthen it.\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nWe know that in some circles it has been\r\nsuggested that humanitarian intervention by a group of\r\nStates particularly interested in a given crisis might be\r\na valid substitute for the work of the Council. My\r\ndelegation does not share this thesis. Unilateral\r\nhumanitarian intervention can easily become an excuse\r\nfor ignoring the prohibition of the use of force. The\r\ndoctrine of a just war ultimately is reduced to\r\nlegitimizing war, destruction and death through weak\r\ntheological arguments.\r\nWe believe that banning the use of force is the\r\ncornerstone for the society of nations, and it must\r\ncontinue to be that. On this prohibition is based the\r\ntrust of the majority of the States which deem this\r\nOrganization the main guarantor for their security, and\r\non it is based every effort to achieve disarmament, as\r\nwell as all supporting initiatives to resolve disputes\r\npeacefully. We fear that if this ban is weakened, the\r\ndoor to violence in international relations will be\r\nopened.\r\nUnder the legal regime established by the Charter,\r\nthe Security Council is the only legitimate mechanism\r\navailable to the international community as a whole for\r\nresponding to armed conflicts or humanitarian crises of\r\nsuch a serious nature that, in and of themselves, they\r\nbecome threats to peace. With the very limited\r\nexception of the right to legitimate self-defence, prior\r\nauthorization by the Security Council is essential for\r\nany initiative that could require the use of force or that\r\nattempts to dominate the States involved in conflict.\r\nIn this context, it is essential that we develop a\r\nnew strategy and doctrine for the establishment and\r\nconduct of peacekeeping operations, in light of the\r\nexperience gained over the past decade. The Brahimi\r\nreport is but one step forward in this direction, and we\r\nbelieve that we need an in-depth and transparent\r\ndiscussion within the General Assembly on the\r\nrecommendations and views expressed in that report.\r\nThe impartiality of the peacekeeping forces, the\r\nconsent of parties in conflict and the limiting of the use\r\nof force to legitimate defence must continue to be the\r\nbasic principles of the political-military doctrine of\r\npeacekeeping operations. Any departure from these\r\nprinciples, if such is really deemed essential, ought to\r\nbe dealt with through the greatest caution and\r\nforethought.\r\nOver the past year, we have seen the\r\nestablishment and growth of a new kind of\r\npeacekeeping operation: the transitional civil\r\nadministrations in Kosovo and East Timor. This kind of\r\noperation presents an unprecedented challenge for the\r\nOrganization, creating obligations and expectations\r\nnever contemplated in the past. The United Nations, on\r\nits own, is expected to provide basic services in health,\r\neducation, public administration, justice, security,\r\npostal service and tax collection; and it is also to\r\npromote economic reconstruction and the\r\nestablishment of democracy in an area of transition.\r\nDespite the intrinsic difficulties in a task of this\r\nmagnitude, the experiences in Kosovo and East Timor\r\nhave, in general, been positive. They provide us with\r\nexamples of the capacity of this institution to act when\r\nthere is the political will to respond effectively to the\r\nrequirements of the situation on the ground. We feel\r\nthat this experience should serve as a model for future\r\nactions.\r\nOver the past year we have also seen some\r\npositive developments in Security Council practices.\r\nThese developments should be encouraged.\r\nFirst, we welcome the sending of observer\r\nmissions made up of Permanent Representatives of\r\nMember States. We believe that such missions allow\r\nmembers of the Council to familiarize themselves at\r\nfirst hand with the requirements of the situation they\r\nmust address. At the same time, the missions allow\r\nmembers to send a clear message to the parties.\r\nHowever, we believe that the scope of these missions\r\nshould not be exaggerated. In this regard, it would be\r\nwell to assess the true results of the Security Council\r\nmissions in April and May of this year to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Kosovo, and\r\nEritrea and Ethiopia.\r\nSecondly, we welcome the candour, courage and\r\nenthusiasm of the group of experts charged with\r\nconsidering sanctions against UNITA. We also admire\r\nthe honesty, independence and the bravery of the\r\nIndependent Inquiry into the actions of the United\r\nNations during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. We\r\nbelieve that such investigations are an essential aspect\r\nof the work of the Organization and that their high\r\nstandards should become the norm for Security Council\r\nactivities.\r\nThirdly, we appreciate the changes in the\r\napproach to imposing sanctions regimes. In particular\r\nwe welcome the fact that the bans imposed against the\r\nparties in the Horn of Africa under resolution 1298\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\n(2000) were imposed for a limited period of time,\r\nwithout the possibility of automatic extension. Any\r\nextension of these measures would require a\r\nsubsequent official decision of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation has for several years advocated such\r\ntime limits on sanctions regimes. We hope that this\r\nprecedent will be followed in future cases.\r\nIn order to realize its purposes and principles the\r\nUnited Nations needs the firm and constant support of\r\nall Member States. It is therefore essential to provide\r\nthis Organization with sufficient financial, operational\r\nand logistical resources — resources that are\r\nproportionate to the tasks entrusted to it. In this regard\r\nwe need to reassess the possibility of establishing\r\npermanent reserves of military, civilian and political\r\nexperts who are available at a moment’s notice, as well\r\nas reserves of materiel for missions. At the same time,\r\ntroop-contributing countries should provide duly\r\ntrained and equipped personnel. We need to give\r\npeacekeeping missions clear mandates in order to avoid\r\nconflicts regarding the control of these missions, and\r\nwe also need to establish uniform procedures and\r\noperational norms for the conduct of these missions. In\r\nshort, we must see peacekeeping missions as one of the\r\nnormal and ongoing activities of the Organization and\r\nnot as exceptional undertakings.\r\nWe are aware that it is expensive to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security effectively. Most of the\r\nproposals we are endorsing require additional financial\r\nresources. If Member States are truly committed to the\r\nmaintenance of peace, greater efforts must be made to\r\nresolve the financial crisis afflicting the Organization.\r\nMy delegation believes that those States that contribute\r\nto endangering international peace and security — that\r\nis, those countries that are the main producers of\r\nweapons or that have disproportionately large military\r\nbudgets — should contribute more to the budget for\r\npeacekeeping operations than those nations whose\r\nmilitary budgets are relatively small in relation to their\r\ngross national products.\r\nIn addition, we must note that armed conflicts\r\nand humanitarian crises are closely related phenomena.\r\nThe causes of conflicts can be found in poverty, social\r\ninjustice, the systematic disregard of human rights and\r\nthe lack of democratic mechanisms for resolving\r\npolitical, ideological and social conflicts.\r\nPromoting international peace and security\r\ninvolves more than setting up peacekeeping missions\r\nor calling for negotiations. The work of the Security\r\nCouncil is limited to dealing with specific events when\r\nall the previous safeguards for peaceful coexistence\r\nhave failed. However, defending peace requires\r\npreventive efforts before conflicts occur and peace-\r\nbuilding efforts at the end of conflicts. Promoting\r\npeace requires an ongoing and sustained effort to create\r\nan atmosphere in which there is mutual respect and\r\nviolence is rejected. True and sustainable peace can\r\nonly be achieved when decent living conditions are\r\nguaranteed for all inhabitants, when there is a sufficient\r\nlevel of economic development to meet all the basic\r\nneeds, when fundamental rights are respected and when\r\ndisputes are resolved by democratic means.\r\nMy delegation believes that, in accordance with\r\nthe distribution of tasks laid down in the Charter, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil are the appropriate bodies for the\r\nimplementation and coordination of such sustained\r\nefforts to prevent conflicts and to build peace. In this\r\ncontext, invests in development, education, health,\r\nhuman rights and democracy are direct investments in\r\nfuture peace — and, therefore, work of that kind is as\r\nimportant as the activities of the Security Council.\r\nIn assessing the work of the Security Council\r\nover the past year, we must also reflect on the activities\r\nof each of our States and on the contributions that have\r\nbeen made to the Organization during this same period.\r\nHave we supported the United Nations in deeds as we\r\nhave supported it in words? Have we furnished the\r\nnecessary human and material resources so that the\r\nOrganization can do its work? Have we provided the\r\nnecessary political support? In short, the successes of\r\nthe Security Council are the successes of the entire\r\ninternational community, just as the failures of the\r\nCouncil are the failure of us all.\r\nMr. Mahbubani (Singapore): At the outset,\r\nplease allow me to thank the President of the Security\r\nCouncil for the month of October, Ambassador Martin\r\nAndjaba, for the excellent presentation he made today\r\nof the annual report of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod 16 June 1999 to 15 June 2000. I would also like\r\nto thank the Security Council secretariat for the\r\nexcellent work it did in producing the voluminous\r\nreport that we have before us today.\r\nAlso before I begin, I would like to thank all the\r\ncountries that have congratulated the five new\r\nmembers of the Security Council elected this year,\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nincluding Singapore. We realize that we have a big job\r\nto do, and we will try to do it to the best of our\r\nabilities.\r\nIn his seminal Millennium Assembly report\r\nentitled “We the peoples”, Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan drew a vivid analogy of our world as a global\r\nvillage. If we use this analogy of the global village, we\r\ncan see the Security Council’s role as akin to that of a\r\nmagistracy that has been entrusted and authorized by\r\nthe village to keep the peace. But this magistracy has a\r\ntwo-tier structure. It comprises first a small group of\r\nfive villagers, who, by virtue mainly of an historical\r\nfait accompli, have been given security of tenure and\r\nother privileges.\r\nThe second group consists of a bigger, but\r\nsignificantly less influential group of 10 members of\r\nthe community, chosen by the village to serve for a\r\nlimited duration based on their ability to advance the\r\ncause of peace in the village. In exchange for the\r\nmagistracy’s agreeing to undertake primary\r\nresponsibility for maintaining peace and security in the\r\nglobal village on behalf of the community, this\r\nmagistracy is granted wide-ranging powers. The village\r\ncommunity has, in turn, agreed to be bound by\r\ndecisions of the magistracy.\r\nSurprisingly, the magistracy has few obligations\r\nin return to the village community. One of these, of\r\ncourse, is to submit an annual written report that\r\ncontains information on the work undertaken by the\r\nmagistracy. Article 15 (1) of the Charter states:\r\n“The General Assembly shall receive and\r\nconsider annual and special reports from the\r\nSecurity Council; these reports shall include an\r\naccount of the measures that the Security Council\r\nhas decided upon or taken to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.”\r\nThat is why we are here today. These annual\r\nreports, it would seem, are the only institutional avenue\r\nthrough which the global village community can\r\ninform itself of the activities of the magistracy. Each\r\nyear, at an annual gathering of the village community,\r\nseveral members take the floor to express their views\r\non the annual report and the magistracy. Some are even\r\ncritical. However, there is little evidence so far that\r\nthese discussions have had any significant impact on\r\nthe magistracy, which remains very much an\r\ninstrument of the most powerful magistrates. As John\r\nFoster Dulles wrote in a somewhat prescient fashion in\r\n1950:\r\n“The Security Council is not a body that merely\r\nenforces agreed law. It is a law unto itself . ... No\r\nprinciples of law are laid down to guide it; it can\r\ndecide in accordance with what it thinks is\r\nexpedient.” (War or Peace, Macmillan, NY, 1950)\r\nThe key question that we therefore have to\r\naddress under this agenda item is whether this state of\r\naffairs is satisfactory. At the Millennium Assembly\r\ngathering of our global village, should we merely\r\ncomment on and criticize this annual report, or should\r\nwe do more? Should we, for example, ask the\r\nmagistracy to account for its failures to perform its role\r\nin maintaining peace and security? Should we also seek\r\nfrom the magistracy a clarification for its non-action on\r\nissues relating to peace and security, particularly when\r\nsuch non-action is tantamount to a dereliction of its\r\nprimary responsibility? This is no abstract question for\r\nsmall States. Small States, which depend on the\r\nSecurity Council for their security, will find their lives\r\nseriously imperilled if the Council fails to fulfil its\r\nobligations under the Charter.\r\nThe bottom-line issue is accountability. I do not\r\nthink that many will challenge the merits of rendering\r\nthe Security Council accountable for its action and\r\nnon-action, including those members holding positions\r\nof special privilege in the Council. There is, after all,\r\nample proof that accountability and its sister principle,\r\ntransparency, are now widely regarded as integral parts\r\nof good governance.\r\nThe consideration of agenda item 11 today has\r\nassumed added significance against the backdrop of the\r\nreports on the fall of Srebrenica and the Rwanda\r\ngenocide of 1994 and ongoing consultations on the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Brahimi\r\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations. I would, in\r\nfact, commend to all a careful study of these reports.\r\nThey tell a sobering story of gross ineptitude, the\r\nprimacy of narrow national interests among key\r\nmembers of the Security Council over everything else,\r\nand the protection of soldiers over civilians, all of\r\nwhich conspired to cause the loss of countless civilian\r\nlives in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda.\r\nPerhaps no other report on these recent debacles\r\nof international diplomacy serves as a greater\r\nindictment of the Security Council, the Secretariat and,\r\nindeed, the international community as a whole — all\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nof us — than the report of the International Panel of\r\nEminent Personalities appointed by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) to investigate the events leading\r\nto the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. This report was\r\nreleased in early June 2000, four months ago. It is\r\npuzzling, perhaps even shocking, that there has been no\r\nmove to have the OAU report discussed by the Security\r\nCouncil. Let me quote a few pertinent findings of the\r\nOAU report to explain the need for enhancing\r\naccountability in the Security Council.\r\n“[T]he evidence is clear that there are a small\r\nnumber of major actors whose intervention could\r\ndirectly have prevented, halted or reduced the\r\nslaughter … Nigeria’s Permanent Representative\r\nto the United Nations, Ambassador Ibrahim\r\nGambari, has reminded us that, ‘There is nothing\r\nwrong with the United Nations that is not\r\nattributable to its members,’ which led him to\r\nconclude: “Without a doubt, it was the Security\r\nCouncil, especially its most powerful members,\r\nand the international community as a whole, that\r\nfailed the people of Rwanda in their gravest hour\r\nof need ...\r\n“The price of this betrayal was paid by\r\ncountless Rwandans, overwhelmingly Tutsi, who\r\nwill forever remain anonymous to the rest of the\r\nworld. In contrast, none of the key actors on the\r\nSecurity Council or in the Secretariat who failed\r\nto prevent the genocide has ever paid any kind of\r\nprice. No resignations have been demanded. No\r\none has resigned on a matter of principle. Many\r\nof their careers have flourished greatly since\r\n1994. Instead of international accountability, it\r\nappears that international impunity is the rule of\r\nthe day.” (Special report of the International\r\nPanel of Eminent Personalities to Investigate the\r\n1994 Genocide in Rwanda and the Surrounding\r\nEvents, paras. 15.40 and 15.41)\r\nThat last suggestion is particularly ironic, as the\r\nSecurity Council has itself never hesitated in the past to\r\ndecry the culture of impunity that purportedly exists\r\namong state and non-state actors in many troubled\r\nparts of the world. It is also inexplicable that, while\r\nindividual countries that had been implicated in the\r\nincident have extended their apologies officially for\r\ntheir part in failing to prevent deaths in Rwanda, a few\r\nothers have not. As for the Security Council, the word\r\n“sorry” appears to be unmentionable.\r\nIt is not my intention to oversimplify the question\r\nof accountability. This is not an easy issue by any\r\nmeans. It can also become a highly charged political\r\nissue. At the same time, accountability has implications\r\nin the legal areas of culpability and reparations. We\r\nneed to confront the issue fairly and squarely, however,\r\nlest the credibility of the Security Council erode further\r\nin the coming years.\r\nIn this respect, there are several questions that we\r\nshould address. First and perhaps most obvious, to\r\nwhom and/or to which body should the Security\r\nCouncil be held accountable? The answer should be\r\nclear enough. We should first recall that, in their\r\nMillennium Declaration adopted at the end of the\r\nMillennium Assembly last September, our leaders\r\nreaffirmed\r\n“the central position of the General Assembly as\r\nthe chief deliberative, policy-making and\r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations.”\r\n(resolution 55/2, para. 30)\r\nThe relevant provisions of  the United Nations\r\nCharter would also support the view that the Security\r\nCouncil, as the beneficiary of specific powers granted\r\nby the Members of the United Nations, has a fiduciary\r\nduty to account to the General Assembly for its actions.\r\nArticle 24 (1) of the Charter explicitly states that the\r\nSecurity Council exercises its powers in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security on behalf — and I\r\nstress, on behalf — of the Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nSecondly, what criteria should we use to\r\ndetermine the performance of the Security Council? A\r\nrelated question is whether the report of the Security\r\nCouncil in its existing format — the thick document\r\nthat we have before us — contains adequate\r\ninformation for the General Assembly to make such an\r\nassessment. We note that, earlier today, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of India asked several pertinent\r\nquestions about the structure and contents of these\r\nannual reports, and we hope that these questions will\r\nbe addressed.\r\nGiven that the objective of this review exercise is\r\nfor the General Assembly to assure itself that the\r\nSecurity Council has indeed discharged its primary\r\nresponsibility, we should be examining such issues as\r\ntimeliness and appropriateness of action and other\r\nmeasures taken by the Council in response to specific\r\ndevelopments.\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nThirdly, how do we ensure that the views of the\r\nGeneral Assembly expressed during this debate on this\r\nagenda item are officially transmitted to the Security\r\nCouncil and then taken cognisance of by the Council?\r\nOn this issue, I note the absence of any formal\r\nmechanism for the comments and views of members of\r\nthe General Assembly expressed during the debate on\r\nthis agenda item to be communicated to the Security\r\nCouncil. No doubt, the members of the Security\r\nCouncil are represented in this Hall. But can they also\r\nrespond to comments made here? This annual debate\r\ncould be more interactive if members of the Security\r\nCouncil could provide immediate feedback to issues\r\nraised by Member States during this debate. It may also\r\nbe useful for the Security Council to meet immediately\r\nafter this agenda item is debated in the General\r\nAssembly to discuss and perhaps implement some of\r\nthe suggestions made here.\r\nThe suggestions we have made today may seem a\r\nlittle radical. But the issue at stake here is the\r\ncontinuing credibility and authority of a key organ of\r\nthe United Nations. Our hope is that our suggestions\r\ntoday will motivate or stimulate other proposals on\r\nhow cooperation between the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council on matters concerning\r\ninternational peace and security could be further\r\nstrengthened. At the same time, we are also fully aware\r\nthat a delicate balance must be struck between the need\r\nfor the Security Council to preserve its ability to take\r\nprompt and effective action on issues on one hand, and\r\nthe continuing demands for greater transparency and\r\naccountability on the other. The work of the Security\r\nCouncil must not be hampered by our work here.\r\nFinally, we would also like to stress here that\r\naccountability is not an end in itself. Beyond\r\nacknowledging that mistakes have been made in the\r\npast, it is also imperative that the Security Council\r\nshould apply lessons learned from its experiences —\r\nboth failures and successes — in its future work.\r\nEventually, it is our common goal to enhance the\r\ncapacity of the Security Council to discharge the\r\nprimary responsibility that it has been entrusted with\r\nby members of this Organization.\r\nMr. Stuart (Australia): Ambassador Mahbubani\r\nis always a hard act to follow and I think he has made a\r\nparticularly interesting intervention today. I thank him\r\nfor that. My delegation would also like to thank\r\nAmbassador Andjaba of Namibia for presenting the\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly\r\ntoday in its capacity as President of the Security\r\nCouncil for the month of October.\r\nIt seems that each year in this debate we note the\r\ngrowing demands placed on the Security Council by an\r\nuncertain and volatile international security\r\nenvironment. Regrettably, the last year has been no\r\nexception. Tension and conflict persist in many parts of\r\nthe world. Old conflicts continue to cost lives and\r\nuntold hardship. And as we are acutely aware in our\r\nown part of the world, new disputes have flared, posing\r\nnew threats to international peace and security.\r\nAs the Security Council’s report to the General\r\nAssembly (A/55/2) shows, the Council has been called\r\non to play a central role in addressing many of these. It\r\nhas been a demanding year in which the Council has\r\nconfronted complex and sometimes seemingly\r\nintractable disputes. Sometimes cooperation from\r\ndisputing parties has been, to put it mildly,\r\nquestionable. The Council has had to make some\r\ndifficult decisions. Four new major peacekeeping\r\nmissions have been established — in East Timor, Sierra\r\nLeone, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia\r\nand Eritrea. The Council has, in many other ways,\r\ncontributed to the maintenance of peace and security in\r\nvarious parts of the world.\r\nOne of the clear lessons that my delegation draws\r\nfrom experience in the last twelve months is that the\r\ncircumstances of each dispute are different. The\r\nspecifics in each case, the historical and political\r\ncontexts, vary widely. The kinds of response the\r\nCouncil might consider to any dispute will need to be\r\ntailored to the particular circumstances.\r\nI draw attention to this point to underline\r\nsomething my delegation has highlighted in\r\ndiscussions on the report of the Security Council in\r\nprevious years: the need for the Council to look for\r\nnew and innovative ways to exercise its influence and\r\nauthority and to promote peace and security. My\r\ndelegation in the past been critical of the excessive\r\nrigidities of the Council’s work practices, and we have\r\nurged Members to look beyond the limitations imposed\r\nby narrow interpretation of the rules of procedure to\r\nfind new ways of doing things.\r\nBy our assessment, important steps have been\r\ntaken in this direction over the last year. A number of\r\nCouncil Presidents, and the Council membership as a\r\nwhole, have been willing to look for ways of more\r\neffectively conducting the Council’s business and\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nasserting its influence. I note that Ambassador Hasmy\r\nof Malaysia has described some of those efforts in his\r\nintervention today.\r\nPerhaps most significant of the innovations from\r\nmy delegation’s point of view over the last year or so\r\nhas been the series of Council missions to regional\r\ntrouble spots. Building on the success of the Council’s\r\nmission to East Timor a little over a year ago, a number\r\nof further missions have taken place since, including to\r\nSierra Leone and Ethiopia and Eritrea. They have been\r\nimportant elements of the international community’s\r\nresponse to these conflicts. They help to inform the\r\nCouncil about the exigencies of the disputes, and send\r\nan important signal to the disputing parties about the\r\nstrength of international concern.\r\nWe have also seen a welcome evolution in the\r\nCouncil’s procedures with regard to meetings. The\r\nseries of meetings that took place in January this year,\r\nbringing together the leaders of several countries\r\ndirectly interested in the conflict in the Great Lakes\r\nregion of Africa, is one example. Other ways have been\r\nfound to enable disputing parties to put their positions\r\ndirectly to the Council. This more flexible approach to\r\nthe convening of meetings, formalized in the\r\npresidential note adopted earlier this year, represents an\r\nimportant step towards a more open, effective and\r\ntransparent Council.\r\nWe note from the report of the Security Council\r\nthat there has been a reduction in the number of\r\ninformal consultations, or so-called consultations of the\r\nwhole, over the period of the report compared to the\r\nyear before. There has also been an increase in the\r\nnumber of formal, open meetings. This trend, to the\r\nextent that it reflects a real shift to greater transparency\r\nand openness, is also welcome.\r\nIn saying this, my delegation does not advocate\r\nthe holding of open meetings just for the sake of\r\nholding them. They should be used genuinely as\r\nopportunities for Member States to put their views on\r\nissues of direct and immediate relevance to them and to\r\nthe Council. When such meetings are held, Council\r\nmembers should listen carefully to the views of the\r\nnon-Council members, bearing in mind their\r\nresponsibility under the Charter to act on behalf of the\r\nwhole membership.\r\nThis trend towards greater openness is welcome,\r\nbut, of course, more that needs to be done. The Brahimi\r\nreport makes a number of important recommendations\r\nabout the way the Council deals with aspects of\r\npeacekeeping, including defining clear and achievable\r\nmandates and enabling the participation of troop-\r\ncontributing countries in key aspects of the planning\r\nand implementation process. Australia supports these\r\nrecommendations, and we look forward to moving\r\nahead with the Security Council and other Member\r\nStates to implement them.\r\nThe key element missing in this process of\r\nchange is, however, expansion of the size of the\r\nCouncil’s permanent and non-permanent membership,\r\nas well as related reforms covering the veto and\r\nperiodic review. We look forward to addressing this\r\nquestion under the relevant agenda item later in this\r\nsession.\r\nMay I conclude with a brief expression of\r\nappreciation and congratulations to all the members of\r\nthe Council for their contributions over the last year,\r\nand particularly to those whose elected terms conclude\r\nat the end of December: Argentina, Canada, Malaysia,\r\nNamibia and the Netherlands. I would also like to\r\nwarmly congratulate the newly elected members of the\r\nCouncil on their election, and pledge Australia’s full\r\nsupport for the work that faces them.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): We would\r\nlike to thank the Permanent Representative of Namibia\r\nand President of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober, Ambassador Martin Andjaba, for introducing\r\nthe report on the activities of the Council for the period\r\n16 June 1999 to 15 June 2000. Undoubtedly, that\r\ncompendium of the Council’s documents and\r\nresolutions stemming from its work over a period of 12\r\nmonths is extremely useful as a quick-reference\r\ndocument for academics and researchers interested in\r\ndecisions taken by the Council.\r\nWhile recognizing the efforts of the members of\r\nthe Security Council to improve the content of its\r\nreport, we must nevertheless express our\r\ndisappointment that the right of Member States to\r\nexpect a substantive document has not yet been fully\r\nmet. We once again urge the members of the Council to\r\ntake measures to ensure that those of us who do not\r\nparticipate in the Council’s debates can, at the very\r\nleast, turn to this document for a substantive look at\r\nhow issues under the Council’s consideration are\r\ntreated. We would like the report to go beyond mere\r\nformal compliance with the obligation imposed by\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, and Article 15, paragraph 1, of\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, and we would like to\r\nsee respect for the right of Member States to have\r\nsubstantive information on the Council’s deliberations,\r\nduring which decisions are made with which all\r\nMember States must subsequently comply.\r\nAlthough there has been an increase in the\r\nnumber of open meetings which all Member States may\r\nattend and/or participate in, we continue to be surprised\r\nby the trend of holding informal consultations as the\r\nnormal working procedure of the Council, in disregard\r\nof the provisions of rule 48 of the Council’s provisional\r\nrules of procedure. That rule clearly establishes that, as\r\na general rule, the Council should meet publicly.\r\nUnfortunately, the exception provided for in that rule\r\nhas become the Council’s practice, and it meets daily\r\nbehind closed doors in informal consultations — a\r\nformat that is not foreseen in the rules. Open meetings\r\nonly serve to formalize substantive agreements arrived\r\nat private gatherings. Similarly, we feel it is\r\ninappropriate to convene private meetings that do not\r\nallow non-members of the Council and parties directly\r\ninvolved to participate. If we take into account the fact\r\nthat the Council’s decisions affect all Members of the\r\nOrganization, then it is inconceivable to accept the\r\nmysterious and secretive way in which the Council\r\ncarries out its work.\r\nWe congratulate the members of the Council that\r\nhave prepared reports on the work of the Council\r\nduring the months they held the presidency. In\r\nparticular, we congratulate those that asked that their\r\nreports be published as official documents. We invite\r\nthem to improve the content of their reports so that\r\nthey are useful to all Members of the Organization, and\r\nwe urge them to promote actions that allow the needs\r\nof all Member States to be met and foster transparency\r\nand democratization in the Council.\r\nThe work of the Council Committee of Experts\r\non working methods is a good indication that its\r\nmembers are aware of the importance of making the\r\nwork of the Council more transparent and democratic.\r\nSimilarly, discussion of these matters in the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council reform is\r\nvery useful within the framework of measures to\r\nimprove the work of the Council.\r\nWe are convinced that, in strict compliance with\r\nthe provisions of the Charter, the Council must limit\r\nitself to the actions provided for in Article 24, rapid\r\nand effective responses to maintain international peace\r\nand security and the prevention of  the worsening of\r\nconflict situations. It is necessary to keep in mind that\r\nthe Council is not a deliberative body and that it lacks\r\nthe ability to issue generally applicable regulatory\r\nprovisions. As we have said on other occasions, that\r\nsort of action is entrusted to the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is the most representative body of the\r\ninternational community. The Assembly’s broad\r\ncompetency includes discussing any questions or\r\nmatters within the scope of the Charter, as provided in\r\nArticle 10; considering general principles of\r\ncooperation in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security; discussing the entire question of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, as\r\nestablished in Article 11; and discussing any other\r\nissue stipulated in Article 13.\r\nWe reiterate our position that the Council should\r\nlimit its work to the spheres of action entrusted to it\r\nand that it should not continue to make general\r\npronouncements with regard to matters not under its\r\npurview. The General Assembly’s role is to carry out\r\ndeliberations and establish norms and doctrines on\r\ncontemporary problems. It is up to the Council to act\r\non crisis situations as they arise.\r\nWe reiterate our appeal to the members of the\r\nCouncil to contribute to the irreversible process of\r\nopenness, transparency and reform of its working\r\nmethods, to which Mexico, and the vast majority of the\r\nMembers of the United Nations, are fully committed.\r\nLastly, my delegation would like to congratulate\r\nColombia, Ireland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore\r\non their election to the Council. We wish them every\r\nsuccess in the course of the next two years.\r\nMr. Levitte (France) (spoke in French): The\r\nAmbassador of Singapore asked whether the members\r\nof the Security Council present in the Hall wished to\r\nrespond to his comments. I would be happy to do so. In\r\nresponding, I would also like to respond to what has\r\njust been said by the Ambassador of Mexico.\r\nToday, I do not intend to address every subject\r\ndealt with by the Security Council in the course of the\r\n12 months covered by the report before the General\r\nAssembly. I simply wish to make a few comments on\r\nthe working methods of the Council and on the way it\r\ndischarges its responsibilities for the maintenance of\r\npeace and security. First of all, I would like to make a\r\npreliminary comment to illustrate that the Security\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nCouncil is not as powerless and paralysed as certain\r\ncritics claim it is.\r\nMuch has been done since June 1999. Despite its\r\ninternal differences — which are perfectly normal and\r\noften healthy — the Council has, among other things,\r\nbeen able to establish complex missions for the\r\nadministration of territories: the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)\r\nand the United Nations Transitional Administration in\r\nEast Timor (UNTAET). After lengthy negotiations, the\r\nCouncil agreed on framework resolution 1284 (1999)\r\nfor resumed cooperation between Iraq and the United\r\nNations, even if, as we believe, it is still necessary to\r\nclarify and finalize certain aspects and to have a\r\npositive response from Iraq.\r\nThe Council has decided also on an approach to\r\nthe problem of Sierra Leone which comprises several\r\nfacets — such as the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone (UNAMSIL), diamonds and justice — even\r\nthough much remains to be done.\r\nIt is true that little progress has been made in\r\nsome other areas; I am thinking in particular of the\r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But\r\nwe must stress here the responsibility that lies with the\r\nparties themselves. We cannot make peace without\r\nthem.\r\nConcerning the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil, three developments seem to me particularly\r\nnoteworthy. The first is the Security Council’s effort to\r\nobtain better information about the conflicts of which it\r\nis seized, an effort which has three elements. The first\r\nis the dispatch of Council field missions. Since\r\nSeptember 1999, the Council has dispatched five\r\nmissions: to Timor, to Kosovo, to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and other Central African\r\ncountries, to Ethiopia and Eritrea, and just last week to\r\nSierra Leone. Next month a mission will travel to East\r\nTimor and then to West Timor. It is clear to all how\r\nuseful these missions are. They make it possible to\r\nmake on-the-spot in-depth assessments of complex\r\nproblems; they are an invaluable reality-check. Such\r\nmissions could also be dispatched in advance of the\r\nformulation or modification of the mandates of\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nThe second way to improve our understanding of\r\na problem is to develop direct contacts with the parties\r\nto a conflict and with other regional actors, as\r\ndemonstrated by several recent initiatives. In January\r\nof this year, Ambassador Holbrooke of the United\r\nStates organized a Security Council meeting with the\r\nheads of State of the signatories of the Lusaka\r\nCeasefire Agreement and some other countries of the\r\nregion. In June, during its presidency of the Council,\r\nFrance continued that direct dialogue by convening a\r\nmeeting of the Council with members of the Political\r\nCommittee of the Lusaka Agreement, comprising its\r\nState and non-State signatories. That meeting was held\r\nin private, and it provided an opportunity for a most\r\nuseful, frank, interactive discussion. It led to the\r\nadoption of Council resolution 1304 (2000) and to the\r\nadoption of a statement by the Political Committee.\r\nThen, in June, the Security Council held a private\r\nmeeting with the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) Ministerial Mediation and\r\nSecurity Committee on Sierra Leone, an exchange of\r\nviews that was, again, very frank. Meetings of this kind\r\nshould be encouraged with a view, inter alia, to\r\nimproving interaction with regional actors and regional\r\norganizations with a central role to play.\r\nFinally, the Security Council has acknowledged\r\nthat troop contributors must be consulted more closely\r\nand more regularly. Experience shows that in the past\r\nthere was insufficient dialogue between the Security\r\nCouncil and troop contributors. Such dialogue is\r\nessential for better understanding of the objectives that\r\nare being pursued, and for unity of concept and action\r\nbetween the Council, which decides on the mandates of\r\npeacekeeping operations, and the troop contributors,\r\nwhich implement them. Such dialogue is particularly\r\nnecessary when there is great tension in the field or\r\nwhen a mandate must be adapted to a changed\r\nsituation. Accordingly, the French delegation recently\r\nproposed a private meeting of the Security Council\r\nwith countries contributing troops to the United\r\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone; in the light of that\r\ninitial, most interesting, experience, we hope that such\r\nmeetings will take place regularly.\r\nThe second recent development relates to the\r\nCouncil’s tools for taking action. These include\r\nsanctions. Since June 1999 the Council has adopted\r\nnew sanctions, but has taken care to learn from past\r\nexperience; these sanctions are targeted, especially in\r\nthe sense that they directly affect those whose\r\nbehaviour they are aimed at changing. The sanctions\r\nwere put in place for a defined period of time, which\r\ncan be extended if the Council so decides. The Council\r\nhas also discussed the effectiveness of sanctions\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nregimes by setting up expert panels to consider how\r\nthey are implemented and complied with, and to make\r\nrecommendations to the Council in that regard. Finally,\r\nin the same spirit, the Council has begun discussing the\r\nlink between the illegal exploitation of natural\r\nresources — in particular precious materials — and the\r\ncontinuation of conflicts, especially in Angola, Sierra\r\nLeone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All\r\nthese developments are welcome and should be\r\nencouraged.\r\nSecondly, peacekeeping operations have\r\nthemselves undergone some changes. There has been\r\nrich and useful debate on this subject since the\r\npublication of the report (A/55/305) of the Panel on\r\nUnited Nations Peace Operations chaired by Mr.\r\nLakhdar Brahimi, whose recommendations we hope\r\nwill be speedily implemented. Yet it should be noted\r\nthat over the past year the Security Council has taken\r\ndecisions along the same lines: its resolution 1291\r\n(2000), on the United Nations Organization Mission in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC),\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to plan for any future\r\ndeployment of an operation. And now the performance\r\nof additional tasks by UNAMSIL has been made\r\ncontinent on the availability of the needed human and\r\nmaterial resources.\r\nFinally, the Council has tried to ensure a smooth\r\ntransition between peacekeeping, which clearly falls\r\nwithin its purview, and post-conflict peace-building,\r\nwhich draws on a variety of actors. In Guinea-Bissau,\r\nthe Post-Conflict Peace-Building Support Office\r\nestablished last year has done an outstanding job. In\r\nFebruary this year a successful peacekeeping\r\noperation — the United Nations Mission in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic (MINURCA) — was replaced by the\r\nUnited Nations Peace-Building Support Office in the\r\nCentral African Republic (BONUCA). And in March,\r\nthe United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti\r\n(MIPONUH) handed over to the International Civilian\r\nSupport Mission in Haiti (MICAH), a peace-building\r\noperation established by the General Assembly. Such\r\nactions should continue, because it is essential for us\r\nnot to lose the investment made by the United Nations\r\nin the peacekeeping phase, and for us to build on what\r\nhas been achieved, so as not to fall back into a spiral of\r\ncrisis and violence.\r\nA third noteworthy development in the work of\r\nthe Council relates to progress in the area of\r\ntransparency; I am thinking here of comments made by\r\ntwo previous speakers. All the Presidents of the\r\nSecurity Council have sought, whenever possible and\r\nappropriate, to convene public meetings to hear\r\nbriefings by the Secretariat or by Special\r\nRepresentatives of the Secretary-General. That\r\nestablishes a new practice which France welcomes. I\r\nthink we can go further in this area.\r\nWith respect to informal consultations, Council\r\nmembers have sought to improve the information that\r\nis provided in real time to non-members. That was\r\ncertainly an abiding concern of the French presidency\r\nlast June, as reflected in oral briefings and on our\r\nInternet site. I know that other Presidents have shared\r\nthe same concern.\r\nHaving said that — and this will be my last\r\ncomment — improvements are still desirable and\r\npossible. In the area of peacekeeping, I have described\r\nour hopes regarding the speedy implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Brahimi report. The\r\nSecurity Council has a special responsibility with\r\nrespect to mandates, which have to be clearly defined,\r\ncredible, achievable and appropriate, and with respect\r\nto relations with the troop contributors.\r\nGreater attention should be given to the regional\r\ndimension of conflicts, in particular in a preventive\r\napproach. The destabilizing effects of the conflict in\r\nSierra Leone on Guinea are an example of this. In that\r\nsame spirit, we must increase interaction between the\r\nSecurity Council and the regional organizations, for\r\nseveral reasons. First, these organizations have a vital\r\nrole to play in the prevention and settlement of\r\nconflicts, as can be seen today with Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\r\nSierra Leone conflict; and secondly, to see to it that in\r\na peace agreement negotiated at the regional level, the\r\nUnited Nations is not be assigned tasks that are\r\nimpossible to carry out.\r\nThese are the comments that the French\r\ndelegation wished to make in this debate, which we\r\nconsider useful and productive and which, we believe,\r\nmakes clear the good working relationship between the\r\nAssembly and the Council.\r\n36\r\nA/55/PV.35\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat the tenth emergency special session of the General\r\nAssembly will resume tomorrow, Wednesday, 18\r\nOctober 2000, at 3 p.m. The list of speakers is now\r\nopen. On Friday, 27 October 2000, at 10 a.m. there will\r\nbe open-ended informal consultations of the plenary on\r\nagenda item 182, on follow-up to the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Assembly, to be held in Conference\r\nRoom 2.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.45 p.m.\r\n"
