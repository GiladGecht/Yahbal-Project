(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 122 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/55/345/Add.9)\r\nThe President: In the letter contained in\r\ndocument A/55/345/Add.9, the Secretary-General\r\ninforms me that, since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications contained in documents A/55/345 and\r\naddenda 1 to 8, Haiti has made the necessary payment\r\nto reduce its arrears below the amount specified in\r\nArticle 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly\r\ntakes note of the information contained in this\r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/55/2)\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my delegation’s appreciation to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador Martin\r\nAndjaba of Namibia, for his lucid and concise\r\nintroduction of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly. This debate cannot\r\nbe regarded as a ritual, as it provides a useful\r\nopportunity for Member States to assess how the\r\nSecurity Council has fulfilled its responsibility under\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nWe all agree that the character of the Security\r\nCouncil’s work has changed dramatically since the end\r\nof the cold war and with the increase in intrastate\r\nconflicts, which have implications for international\r\npeace and security. This has broadened the scope of the\r\nissues before the Council and has challenged it to find\r\nways to be more responsive to situations as they arise.\r\nOver the past year, the Security Council has\r\nsought to become more responsive to the wider\r\nmembership of the United Nations. It has focused\r\nattention on conflicts in Africa and is currently fully\r\nengaged in peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone,\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia\r\nand Eritrea. Earlier this year, the Council met with the\r\nheads of State and Government of the countries of the\r\nGreat Lakes region of Africa and with Foreign\r\nMinisters of the Committee of Six of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States. The Council has\r\nalso addressed issues such as the prevention of armed\r\nconflict, demobilization, disarmament and reintegration\r\nof ex-combatants, children and armed conflict, and the\r\nprotection of civilians and humanitarian workers\r\naffected by armed conflict. All of these issues pose\r\nchallenges to international peace and security. The\r\ndebates on conflict prevention, held in November 1999\r\nand again in July of this year, demonstrated the\r\ncommitment of the Council to addressing this very\r\nimportant issue, in keeping with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\ncentury to increasingly focus on preventive action. My\r\ndelegation therefore looks forward to the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on conflict prevention, which is due\r\nin May 2001, and we believe that it will provide a basis\r\nfor future action by the Council.\r\nThe consideration of these broad areas is an\r\nattempt by the Council to address relevant and cross-\r\ncutting issues that are outside the mandates of specific\r\npeacekeeping missions. At the same time, the Council’s\r\nmissions to East Timor, Kosovo and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, as well as the recently\r\nconcluded mission to West Africa, have provided\r\nopportunities to the international community to gain a\r\nbetter understanding of these complex undertakings\r\nand to respond in a timely manner to these situations.\r\nWe have seen in recent years an effort by the\r\nSecurity Council to respond to the call of Member\r\nStates to raise the standard of its reporting to the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to be more analytic and\r\ninformative. In the past year, some progress has been\r\nrecorded. We have seen some improvement in the\r\ntransparency of the work of the Security Council.\r\nThere has been a conscious effort to widen\r\nparticipation by Member States in its discussions. The\r\nCouncil has engaged, in a decidedly more meaningful\r\nway, in communication with affected Member States\r\nand, during this reporting period, has devised some\r\nnew and made use of previously underutilized meeting\r\nformats to discuss sensitive issues with affected parties\r\nto disputes.\r\nJamaica subscribes to the view that, as much as is\r\npossible, the Council’s work should be conducted in\r\npublic. Nevertheless, the utilization of the private\r\nmeetings format does allow participants to have frank\r\nexchanges of views. This format was put to good use,\r\nfor example, in meetings with the facilitators former\r\nPresident Mandela and Sir Ketumile Masire. Arria-\r\nformula meetings have, in our view, also continued to\r\nprovide an opportunity for members of the Council to\r\ninteract with representatives of non-governmental\r\norganizations and other groups, which are often\r\nintimately involved with issues of primary concern to\r\nthe Council. In addition, the monthly assessments by\r\nformer Presidents of the work of the Council, taken\r\ntogether, have provided a useful overview of the\r\nCouncil’s work. This is not to say that my delegation\r\nentertains any misperception of our having arrived at a\r\nsatisfactory level of reform. There remains much to be\r\ndone.\r\nJamaica is currently an elected member of the\r\nSecurity Council and we are honoured to serve the\r\ninternational community in this capacity. Our\r\ntemporary presence on the Security Council does not,\r\nand indeed will not, obscure our vision of the need for\r\nprofound changes as to how the Council is constituted\r\nand how it should operate. Indeed, Prime Minister P. J.\r\nPatterson, at the Security Council Summit on 7\r\nSeptember, stated that the Council must have a truly\r\nrepresentative membership and that, by failing to take\r\nnote of changes in the relative standing of States in the\r\npast half-century and the expansion of United Nations\r\nmembership, the Security Council has allowed its\r\nrepresentative character to be diminished and its\r\ndemocratic legitimacy to suffer.\r\nOne issue of continuing concern to my delegation\r\nis the use of sanctions. We are therefore pleased that\r\nthe Security Council has decided to create a Working\r\nGroup on Sanctions. We look forward to the provision\r\nof practical recommendations for streamlining\r\nsanctions regimes and for providing guidelines for the\r\nimposition and lifting of sanctions. We wish, in\r\nparticular, to commend the trailblazing work done by\r\nthe committees on sanctions relating to the situations in\r\nAngola and in Sierra Leone. This work has sharpened\r\nthe focus on the link between armed conflict and illegal\r\nexploitation of natural resources, particularly\r\ndiamonds.\r\nIn recent weeks, Member States have been paying\r\nmuch attention to the report of the Panel on United\r\nNations Peace Operations (A/55/305), chaired by\r\nAmbassador Lakhdar Brahimi. The Brahimi report has\r\nidentified significant weaknesses in the way the United\r\nNations carries out its responsibilities in the area of\r\npeace operations and has made recommendations for\r\nour consideration on conflict prevention, peacekeeping\r\noperations and post-conflict peace-building. The\r\nSecurity Council has now established a Working Group\r\ntasked with undertaking a full examination of the\r\nrecommendations relating to the Security Council that\r\nare contained in the Brahimi report. Council members\r\nhave approached this undertaking with an open mind,\r\nbut most importantly with a clear undertaking to\r\nimprove the work of the Security Council in carrying\r\nout its responsibilities.\r\nThe Working Group, among other things, has\r\nundertaken to examine its decision-making process,\r\nways in which to establish closer collaboration and\r\nmeaningful consultations with troop-contributing\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\ncountries, ways to ensure consistency of peacekeeping\r\noperations with international human rights regimes,\r\nhow to establish clear and well-defined mandates\r\nreflecting the needs and conditions of the situations on\r\nthe ground and how to involve the Security Council in\r\nconflict prevention, including closer cooperation with\r\nother United Nations organs and agencies. The\r\nWorking Group has been placed on a fast track by the\r\nSecurity Council, a clear recognition of the Council\u0027s\r\nwillingness to reform peacekeeping operations.\r\nMy delegation wishes to underscore the need for\r\na strengthened Security Council which will effectively\r\nensure the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity in accordance with the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. We will work\r\ntowards this goal.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to extend\r\nour sincere congratulations to the newly elected\r\nmembers: Colombia, Ireland, Mauritius, Norway and\r\nSingapore. We look forward to working with them in\r\nthe Council when they take their seats next year.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of\r\nIran): Allow me to express my appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Andjaba, Permanent Representative of\r\nNamibia and President of the Security Council, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Council to the General\r\nAssembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Singapore, Colombia, Ireland, Norway\r\nand Mauritius on their election to the Security Council.\r\nI trust that the new non-permanent members will help\r\nenhance the openness, transparency and\r\nrepresentativeness of the Council to the full extent\r\npermissible under the current structure of that main\r\nbody of the United Nations.\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter confers on the Security\r\nCouncil primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security on behalf of the full\r\nmembership of the United Nations, and at the same\r\ntime it stipulates that the Council should submit an\r\nannual report and, when necessary, a special report to\r\nthe General Assembly for its consideration. In other\r\nwords, the General Assembly expects the Council to be\r\naccountable for its work to the membership from which\r\nit receives its powers, and the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly is the\r\nconstitutional link which establishes accountability\r\nbetween the two main bodies of the United Nations.\r\nTherefore, we attach great importance to the\r\nagenda item under consideration. However, we believe\r\nthat the report still continues to be mainly a\r\ncompilation of documents, remembrance of activities\r\nand restatement of facts with regard to those activities.\r\nUnfortunately, and similar to the previous reports to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the current 552-page report,\r\ncontained in document A/55/2, covering the period\r\nfrom 16 June 1999 to 15 June 2000, describes only\r\nwhat the Security Council has done and remains largely\r\nsilent about the reasons and circumstances leading to\r\nthe decisions adopted. While the extensive and\r\nfrequent consultations of the whole continued to be the\r\nmain pillar of decision-making in the Council over the\r\nreporting period, almost no information is provided in\r\nthe report on those consultations.\r\nThe General Assembly, at its fifty-first session,\r\nadopted resolution 51/193 in an effort to reform the\r\nreporting procedure of the Security Council. In this\r\nresolution, the Council is encouraged to provide a\r\nsubstantive and analytical account of its work and,\r\ninter alia, to include information on the consultations\r\nof the whole undertaken prior to actions by the Council\r\non the issues within its mandate. Unfortunately, the\r\nCouncil continues to fall short of the wishes of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAs to the working methods of the Council, we\r\nwelcome and encourage a number of initiatives\r\nadopted by the Council over the past few years with a\r\nview to making its working methods more transparent\r\nand democratic and its report analytical and\r\ninformative. We believe that the consultations\r\nconducted in the course of the last seven years in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council have affected positively some aspects\r\nof the working methods of the Council, resulting in\r\nsome limited progress in this field, in particular\r\nregarding transparency and the holding of public\r\nmeetings.\r\nWhile we believe that the working methods of the\r\nCouncil should be considered as integral parts of a\r\ncommon package, we are of the view that this should\r\nnot prevent the Council from implementing the\r\nprovisional agreements so far recorded in the Working\r\nGroup, thus improving the Council’s working methods.\r\nTherefore, we are of the view that more interaction\r\nbetween the Security Council and the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group could result in more progress in\r\nreforming the work of the Council.\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nUndoubtedly, the restoration of peace and\r\ntranquillity in Tajikistan and the completion of the\r\npeace process and the achievement of national\r\nreconciliation in that country, which resulted in the\r\nsuccessful termination of the mandate of the United\r\nNations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT)\r\nin May 2000, should be inscribed on the list of those\r\nissues successfully handled by the Security Council\r\nand the United Nations system as a whole. The positive\r\noutcome of the peace process in that country is\r\nattributable, among other things, to the United Nations\r\ninvolvement from the very beginning of the hostilities\r\nin that country. The United Nations was instrumental in\r\nassisting the negotiation process, which was conducted\r\nunder its aegis. The Security Council gave a clear\r\nmandate to UNMOT, based on the General Agreement\r\nbetween the parties, and supported the Mission and\r\nresponded positively to its needs whenever necessary.\r\nThe United Nations involvement and the\r\nsustained political support of the Security Council\r\nproved extremely useful in dealing with the inter-Tajik\r\nconflicts. They are exactly what have been lacking with\r\nregard to the crisis in the Middle East. It is very\r\nunfortunate that, even in the face of the provocations\r\nand excessive use of force by the Israeli forces against\r\nthe defenceless Palestinian civilians, which clearly\r\njeopardized peace and security in the Middle East, a\r\nbig effort was made to hold the Council back from\r\nlooking into the issue. Despite the request made by\r\nseveral regional groups, it took a very long time to\r\novercome the opposition to the holding of a public\r\nmeeting on the Palestinian question.\r\nIt was equally unfortunate that the right of non-\r\nmembers to participate in the debate in the public\r\nmeeting on the issue was questioned and disputed. We\r\nregret that some tried hard to prevent the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations simply expressing\r\ntheir opinions, expectations, frustrations and even\r\nanger when the world community is incapable of\r\nprotecting civilians from the cruelty of a well-armed\r\narmy of occupation. While there is general agreement\r\nthat the current working methods of the Council are\r\ninappropriate, and some significant provisional\r\nagreements have been reached in the Working Group in\r\nan effort to make the Council more transparent,\r\ndemocratic and accessible to non-members, it is\r\ndistressing to witness such attempts to further restrict\r\nthe holding of public meetings and preclude non-\r\nmembers from speaking in the Council.\r\nMore broadly speaking, the way in which the\r\nSecurity Council has dealt with the situation in the\r\nMiddle East over the past several decades is a\r\nmanifestation of the inadequacy and inappropriateness\r\nof its working methods, especially those allowing the\r\nexercise of the veto. Many times in the past the\r\nSecurity Council has been called upon to shoulder its\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security by putting an end to\r\nthe inhuman, aggressive acts of the Israeli regime. But,\r\nregrettably, the exercise, or threat of the exercise, of\r\nthe veto has frequently paralysed the Council and\r\nprevented it from discharging its constitutional\r\nresponsibility on such a crucial issue.\r\nThe mere existence of the right of veto prevented\r\nthe Council from dealing effectively with, among\r\nothers, the crises in Kosovo and the Palestinian\r\noccupied territories last year and this year. The position\r\nof my delegation on the issue of the veto has been\r\nspelled out in the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, and we hope that the Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council Reform will finally reach agreement\r\non curtailing the right of veto, with a view to its final\r\nelimination.\r\nExacerbation of the situation in Afghanistan, due\r\nto a combination of various factors — namely,\r\npreparation for war and periodic offensives launched\r\nby the Taliban, a severe and fast-spreading drought and\r\nharsh restrictions and inhuman treatment in the areas\r\ncontrolled by the Taliban — continues to warrant close\r\nattention by the Security Council. Regrettably, the\r\nTaliban continues to defy the repeated demands of the\r\ninternational community, reflected in numerous United\r\nNations resolutions, to cease insisting on a military\r\nsolution of the conflict and to seriously engage in\r\nnegotiations aimed at settling it peacefully. We believe\r\nthat the Council should continue to send warning\r\nsignals to the belligerent party and follow up on the\r\ndecision it has already made. Sustained political\r\ninvolvement of the Council and determination in\r\nimplementing its resolutions on Afghanistan is\r\nabsolutely necessary for inducing the Taliban to accept\r\na negotiated settlement.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): My delegation welcomes\r\nthis opportunity to consider the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly covering the period\r\nfrom 16 June 1999 to 15 June 2000. We express our\r\nappreciation to this month’s President of the Security\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nCouncil, Ambassador Martin Andjaba of Namibia, for\r\nhis excellent introduction of the report.\r\nThe report clearly shows the scope and intensity\r\nof the Council’s activities in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Norway welcomes the\r\nfact that the world community increasingly turns to the\r\nUnited Nations for solutions to conflicts, whether in\r\nSouth-East Europe, Western Africa or East Timor.\r\nCollective international security rests on the Member\r\nStates’ commitment to multilateral cooperation.\r\nThe Norwegian delegation is grateful for the\r\nconfidence shown by the United Nations membership\r\nin electing Norway as a non-permanent Council\r\nmember for the next two years. We look forward to\r\nworking with other members of the Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly to further strengthen the primary\r\nrole of the Council in matters of world peace.\r\nThe General Assembly has a legitimate interest in\r\nbeing fully informed of the activities of the Council.\r\nNorway will therefore work to make the report even\r\nmore informative and useful to the membership at\r\nlarge.\r\nWhile nothing must be done that might reduce the\r\nCouncil’s ability to efficiently carry out its primary\r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, it is clear that questions of peace and security\r\nare closely interconnected with issues that are the\r\nresponsibility of the General Assembly, the Economic\r\nand Social Council and other development bodies.\r\nNorway will work to strengthen the interlinkages\r\nbetween the United Nations peace and development\r\nefforts. Cooperation between the Security Council and\r\nthe various United Nations bodies responsible for vital\r\nareas such as poverty reduction, development\r\nassistance, human rights and the environment is crucial\r\nin order to tackle the root causes of conflict.\r\nNorway therefore stresses the need for a\r\ncomprehensive approach to conflict prevention and\r\npeace-building. This entails close cooperation between\r\nthe Security Council, the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and other relevant\r\nUnited Nations bodies. It also entails improved\r\ncoordination within the Secretariat. We fully support\r\nthe analysis and recommendations made in the Brahimi\r\nreport (A/55/305) in this regard.\r\nThe Norwegian delegation has consistently\r\nunderlined the importance of improving transparency\r\nand openness in the work of the Security Council. We\r\nwill continue to work towards this end also from within\r\nthe Council. Progress has indeed been achieved over\r\nthe past few years. We welcome the fact that both\r\nregular and informal practices for sharing information\r\nwith non-members have been established and further\r\nimproved.\r\nWe appreciate the practice of holding open\r\nmeetings on important security issues on the Council’s\r\nagenda. Such meetings should ensure that the views of\r\nthe United Nations membership at large are taken into\r\naccount in the Council’s own deliberations.\r\nAt the same time, open meetings should be\r\nclearly focused on the relevant issues and conflicts\r\nconcerned, in order to ensure the highest possible\r\nefficiency in the conflict resolution activities of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe welcome the fact that Council meetings such\r\nas briefings by the Secretariat or Special\r\nRepresentatives are increasingly held in an open format\r\nrather than in consultations of the whole.\r\nNorway would like to stress the importance of\r\nmaking full use of the mechanisms that have been\r\nestablished to facilitate consultations between Council\r\nmembers and troop-contributors to peacekeeping\r\noperations. All troop-contributing nations, including\r\nthose participating with civilian personnel in\r\nmultifunctional operations, have a legitimate interest\r\nand need to be consulted when such operations are\r\ndiscussed, in a way that makes their contribution to the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making process a reality, not a\r\nformality.\r\nRegional and subregional organizations have in\r\nrecent years become ever more important instruments\r\nin the United Nations efforts to promote international\r\npeace and security. This is not least the case in Africa.\r\nNorway is proud to be working closely with such\r\norganizations, as well as with national Governments in\r\nAfrica, in order to promote conflict resolution,\r\nhumanitarian assistance and development cooperation.\r\nIt is crucial that the Council remain fully focused on\r\nthe complex challenges facing Africa.\r\nThe Security Council remains at the centre of the\r\ninternational community’s search for lasting peace and\r\nsecurity for the world community. This is how it should\r\nbe. It is of vital importance to all Members of the\r\nUnited Nations that the authority of the Council remain\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nstrong and undiminished in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe United Nations membership can, of course, rely on\r\nNorway’s full commitment and support.\r\nMr. Aboulgheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I wish\r\nto express my appreciation to Ambassador Martin\r\nAndjaba, Permanent Representative of Namibia, for his\r\npresentation to the Assembly of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/55/2). The submission of this\r\nreport is pursuant to Article 15 and Article 24 of the\r\nCharter and is an affirmation of the principle that we\r\nall uphold concerning the relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, permitting\r\nthe latter to exercise its inherent responsibility, in\r\naccordance with the Charter, to maintain international\r\npeace and security. This enables the Assembly to\r\npursue appropriately its work relating to the follow-up\r\nof the work of the Council, discussion of its actions\r\nand adoption of the appropriate recommendations on\r\nthem.\r\nI join many previous speakers in referring in\r\nparticular to the persistence of a number of\r\nshortcomings and pitfalls in the work and current\r\nworking methods of the Council. First, the Council,\r\nwhile having increased the number of public and open\r\nmeetings this year, continues, in performing its tasks,\r\nto insist on diversifying the format of its meetings and\r\nestablishing artificial criteria on attendance or\r\nparticipation in such sessions. This makes the Security\r\nCouncil a selective organ whose leadership has a\r\nlimited number of voices that seek to impose\r\nthemselves and their will on others, including the\r\ngeneral membership of the Organization, which we\r\nbelieve has the right, in accordance with the Charter, to\r\nbe fully informed of the proceedings of that important\r\nbody.\r\nSecondly, the Council continues to follow a\r\nclosed and non-transparent approach that cannot be\r\nredressed through the efforts of any single party to\r\nconsider situations affecting international peace and\r\nsecurity. Yet we find it engaged for days considering\r\nrequests submitted by a number of States — not just\r\none State — to convene a formal meeting intended to\r\naddress an issue that the entire world — but perhaps\r\nnot the Security Council — recognizes as having a\r\ndirect impact on international security. I am referring to\r\nthe situation in the Palestinian territories. The Council\r\nmet for hours in many meetings trying to agree on a\r\nquestion involving a guaranteed right of all Member\r\nStates under the Charter. It finally emerged with a\r\nformula that allows some of its members to control the\r\nfinal format of its meeting in a very politicized manner,\r\nfor which we see no place under the rules and rights\r\nenshrined in the Constitution of all Member States: the\r\nCharter.\r\nThirdly, regarding a related matter, we find that\r\nthe Council continues its isolationist trend when it\r\ninsists on exclusively designing a specific mandate for\r\na peacekeeping operation based either on scant or\r\nincomplete information or partial or perhaps inaccurate\r\nrecommendations or discussions among its members,\r\nfrom which those who have the practical, technical and\r\nmilitary expertise are absent.\r\nTherefore, we find at the end of this endeavour a\r\nset of tasks and operations that the Security Council\r\nassumes and believes that troops from a number of\r\nStates, the majority of which are from developing\r\ncountries, will hasten to implement and undertake. A\r\nclear example of this was manifest in the peacekeeping\r\noperation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in\r\nwhich Egypt decided not to participate after thorough\r\nconsideration of the issue, despite many Egyptian\r\ncommitments to bring about peace in Africa.\r\nIf we are to reaffirm two positive and\r\nencouraging points of Security Council resolutions of\r\nthe past year, they would be the time frame for the\r\nsanctions imposed on Ethiopia and Eritrea and the\r\nembargo on illicit trade in diamonds from Sierra\r\nLeone. These are certainly encouraging examples and\r\nfully confirm what the Egyptian delegation and many\r\nother delegations had previously called for regarding\r\nthe need for the Council to cease imposing open-ended\r\nand far-reaching sanctions, which it has resorted to\r\nincreasingly since the early 1990s.\r\nIn this context, I wish to refer to Egypt’s\r\nconsistent position on this issue: that sanctions\r\nimposed by the Council should in no way have a\r\nnegative impact on people and that the humanitarian\r\naspect should be taken into account before considering\r\ntheir implementation, given their adverse and\r\nsometimes devastating repercussions on the\r\ninfrastructure of societies, particularly since most\r\nsanctions have been imposed on developing countries.\r\nI also wish to reaffirm the need not to allow\r\nnarrow political or internal considerations of the\r\nmembers of the Council, in particular the permanent\r\nmembers, to prevail over the collective considerations\r\nof the Council or the general United Nations\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nmembership, since any practice of this kind would\r\nmake the Security Council a tool for implementing the\r\nforeign policy objectives of its members, which is\r\nunacceptable by all standards.\r\nThe issue of reforming the working methods of\r\nthe Council and of increasing transparency in its work\r\nis only one of the important aspects in bringing about a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the work and composition of\r\nthe Security Council. The Egyptian delegation is\r\nactively participating in discussions on this issue\r\nthrough the Open-ended Working Group on the reform\r\nand expansion of the Security Council. We look\r\nforward to its resumption of work as soon as possible.\r\nThere is one final point we must address. It\r\nconcerns situations in which the Security Council faces\r\na problem that threatens peace and security\r\ninternationally or domestically. Despite that threat, the\r\nCouncil fails to address the situation by failing to\r\nexpress its opinion or taking measures or actions due to\r\nthe threat by some of its permanent members to\r\npreclude or prevent the expected action or measure or\r\nthe expression of opinion.\r\nIn such a case the issue should not be left up to\r\npolitical or military Powers or alliances to decide or act\r\nupon without a legitimate or legal United Nations\r\nframework. On the other hand, we should all be aware\r\nof the fact that in cases of such failures by the Council,\r\nthe General Assembly remains the principal legislative\r\nbody of the Organization that brings together all\r\nMember States and that can always express its opinion.\r\nThe General Assembly represents the\r\ninternational community. The resolution known as\r\n“Uniting for peace”, which has been invoked on more\r\nthan one occasion in the past, can be applied any time\r\nthe Council fails to assume its responsibilities. Doing\r\nso precludes the possibility of leaving the door open to\r\nacts of intervention and actions and measures that do\r\nnot always enjoy full international legitimacy.\r\nMs. Abbas (Indonesia): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my delegation’s appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Martin Andjaba, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Namibia and President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the month of October, for his\r\ncogent introduction of the Council’s annual report\r\ncovering the period from 16 June 1999 to 15 June\r\n2000.\r\nWe are gratified to note that the consideration of\r\nthe report by the General Assembly this year once\r\nagain provides an opportunity to engage in the\r\nnecessary interaction and substantive dialogue between\r\nthese two principal organs of the United Nations, in\r\naccordance with Article 24, paragraph 3, of the\r\nCharter. The fulfilment of such a fundamental\r\nrequirement has become even more important, given\r\nthe Declaration by the Millennium Summit, in our\r\nefforts to strengthen the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nNeedless to say, such processes are bound to\r\nsupport and strengthen the roles of both the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council in discharging their\r\nrespective mandates. More importantly, in my\r\ndelegation’s considered view, the holding of this annual\r\nexercise highlights the accountability of the Council to\r\nthe Assembly and also serves to achieve a better\r\nbalance between the role of the Council and those of\r\nthe other principal organs of the United Nations.\r\nIt is in that context that my delegation considers\r\nthis year’s report, which is now before us. We readily\r\nacknowledge that some of the legitimate demands\r\nmade on the Council have been responded to by its\r\nmembers and have been reflected in its present report.\r\nMost notably, that includes increased recourse to open\r\nmeetings, thereby allowing for wider participation by\r\nnon-members to provide their invaluable insights into\r\nthe issues under consideration. In our opinion, this is a\r\nstep in the right direction that provides for more\r\nbalanced and impartial decisions, particularly when\r\nthose decisions have a direct bearing on the parties\r\nconcerned and with regard to the effective\r\nimplementation of those decisions.\r\nNotwithstanding these steady and positive\r\nimprovements, it cannot be denied that the report,\r\nregrettably, remains basically a compilation of the\r\nnumerous communications addressed to the Security\r\nCouncil and of the decisions adopted by it. Hence, my\r\ndelegation would like to reiterate its call that the\r\nannual reports of the Council should no longer be a\r\nmere description of activities and a reproduction of\r\nresolutions already known. Rather, it should contain\r\nassessments of the decisions taken on the various\r\nissues, in order to meet the need for greater clarity and\r\nunderstanding of the Council’s reasoning and motives\r\nin adopting them.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nWe have also seen the procedures of the sanctions\r\ncommittees become more transparent and a greater\r\nflow of information become available to non-members,\r\nparticularly through the briefings offered by the\r\npresidencies. Some of those were substantive and\r\ndetailed.\r\nOn the other hand, while we recognize the\r\nlegitimacy of sanctions as an instrument for\r\nenforcement provided for in the Charter, sanctions\r\nshould have clear and specific time-frames and\r\nappropriate review mechanisms. Most importantly, they\r\nshould be lifted when their objectives have been\r\nachieved. Otherwise, as we have seen, sanctions cause\r\nenormous sufferings not only for the targeted country,\r\nbut also to neighbouring States and beyond.\r\nIndonesia shares the growing distrust and\r\nscepticism about the rationale and usefulness of\r\nsanctions. We are also aware of the fact that the\r\nSecurity Council has imposed sanctions 12 times\r\nduring the past decade and only twice prior to that\r\nperiod. That increase alone and its attendant\r\nhumanitarian consequences call for an agonizing\r\nreappraisal of sanctions, which we believe is currently\r\nunderway in the Council.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities also\r\nwarrant a major review to determine the causes of\r\nfailures and to prevent such setbacks in the future. Past\r\nexperiences have all yielded new insights that can be\r\nmost useful, as the Organization will be called upon to\r\ndeal with similar situations in the future. Confronted by\r\nextraordinarily rapid developments in the field,\r\npeacekeeping operations have become immensely\r\ncomplex, with new types of tasks being entrusted to\r\nthem. Those tasks have, in turn, drawn our attention in\r\nparticular to the maintenance of law and order, the\r\nrecruitment of professionals, the improvement of\r\nlogistics, the need for better trained and equipped\r\ntroops from developing countries and for appropriate\r\nSecurity Council mandates, and the availability of\r\nadequate resources.\r\nWith regard to transparency in peacekeeping\r\noperations, the holding of direct consultations between\r\nthe Security Council, the Secretariat and troop-\r\ncontributing countries has now become an established\r\npractice, particularly when significant extensions are\r\ndue. All of these are clear manifestations of the\r\npositive trends towards greater transparency in the\r\nwork of the Council, which my delegation fully\r\nsupports and which must be encouraged.\r\nThese issues are of immense interest and concern\r\nto Indonesia as a troop-contributing country, especially\r\nat this juncture when peacekeeping operations face new\r\nchallenges and complexities and when the nature and\r\nconditions of international security are undergoing\r\nfundamental changes. The credibility of the United\r\nNations in the new millennium may depend upon the\r\neffective implementation of its peacekeeping\r\nresponsibilities, among other things. For these reasons,\r\nand to make its modest contribution in the future, my\r\nGovernment has recently decided to establish a\r\nnational training centre for peacekeeping, in order to\r\nfacilitate its continued and active participation in these\r\noperations.\r\nThe accountability of the Council will ultimately\r\nhave to be judged on its record of objectivity and\r\nimpartiality, fairness and just decisions. Recent events,\r\nhowever, tend to demonstrate selectivity and the use of\r\ndifferent yardsticks and criteria in dealing with similar\r\nsituations, which in turn could affect the credibility of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe Council remains our only hope for peace in a\r\nworld fraught with tension and conflicts. This is\r\nreflected in its report, which describes how it\r\ncontinually endeavours to take appropriate action in\r\nresponse to threats to peace and security, to adopt\r\nvarious measures aimed at controlling and resolving\r\nconflicts and to muster regional and international\r\nsupport for those measures.\r\nWe hope that the Council will take into account\r\nthe views of the general membership in its decision-\r\nmaking, so that its moral authority can be sustained. In\r\nthat context, it is also the opinion of my delegation that\r\nthe views expressed during the present debate would be\r\nof more benefit to the general membership if the\r\nCouncil were to give them a more in-depth assessment\r\nwith a view to adopting implementable follow-up\r\nmeasures.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing our\r\ncongratulations to the delegations of Colombia,\r\nIreland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore upon their\r\nelection as non-permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil. We wish them success in the discharge of\r\ntheir responsibilities. I would like also to pay tribute to\r\nthe outgoing members of the Council for their\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nimportant contribution to the promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I begin with warm congratulations to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober, His Excellency Ambassador Martin Andjaba,\r\nPermanent Representative of Namibia. We thank him\r\nfor the very informative statement he made yesterday\r\nin introducing the report of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod 16 June 1999 to 15 June 2000 (A/55/2). His\r\nstatement provided a full picture of the Council’s work.\r\nThe statistics speak for themselves: as the President of\r\nthe Council recalled, and as the report indicates, the\r\nCouncil held 144 formal meetings and 194\r\nconsultations of the whole, and considered more than\r\n85 reports of the Secretary-General and received 1,165\r\nother documents and communications from States and\r\nregional and other intergovernmental organizations.\r\nThe Council adopted 57 resolutions and issued 38\r\nstatements by its Presidents. Through the dispatch of\r\nSecurity Council missions, the Council established a\r\npresence in a number of conflict areas. As its President\r\ninformed us, the Council’s work is taking place in an\r\natmosphere of increasing transparency. We welcome\r\nthat trend, and we encourage the Council to continue it.\r\nOur appreciation goes also to those members of\r\nthe Council whose statements in the present debate\r\nfleshed out what might seem to some a rather dry or\r\nmerely factual report, thereby enriching our\r\nunderstanding of the functioning of the Council and of\r\nhow it shoulders its responsibilities with respect to the\r\nmaintenance of peace. I am thinking in particular of the\r\nstatement by the Permanent Representative of France,\r\nAmbassador Jean-David Levitte.\r\nMy warmest congratulations go also to the\r\nPermanent Representatives of Colombia, Ireland,\r\nMauritius, Norway and Singapore, whose countries,\r\nour friends, have just been elected to non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nThe subject of my statement today will be Africa\r\nand the Security Council. But I wish first to make a\r\nfew general comments and to pose a few questions\r\narising out of our current consideration of the report of\r\nthe Security Council. Let us recall that the report was\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly under paragraph 3\r\nof Article 24 and paragraph 1 of Article 15 of the\r\nCharter. The latter reads as follows:\r\n“The General Assembly shall receive and\r\nconsider annual and special reports from the\r\nSecurity Council; these reports shall include an\r\naccount of the measures that the Security Council\r\nhas decided upon or taken to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.”\r\nThus, the Assembly considers the Council’s\r\nactivities after the fact. What is the true purpose of this\r\nafter-the-fact consideration? Does the Assembly have\r\nthe right to guide the Council’s proceedings, or does it\r\nmerely have the right to receive information? Those are\r\nthe kinds of issues we ought at some point to debate.\r\nParagraph 3 of Article 24 states that\r\n“The Security Council shall submit annual\r\nand, when necessary, special reports to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for its consideration.”\r\nDoes the explicit provision that the Council should\r\nsubmit reports to the General Assembly “for its\r\nconsideration” exclude the right of the Assembly to\r\napprove or reject such reports? That is another question\r\nworth asking.\r\nTurning to the actual substance of the report,\r\nshould the Council be required to justify the content of\r\nthe reports it submits? If we merge the provisions of\r\nparagraph 1 of Article 15 and its logical extension,\r\nparagraph 3 of Article 24, we find ourselves facing the\r\nvery core of the problem of overlapping jurisdictions of\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council with\r\nrespect to the maintenance of peace.\r\nAt some stage, we should debate these issues with\r\na view at least to beginning to respond to some of the\r\nquestions I have raised, and to add focus to our\r\nconsideration and debate on the reports of the Security\r\nCouncil. But in the meantime, the interest in the\r\nactivities of the Security Council makes me wonder\r\nwhether future discussion of the reports of the Council\r\ncould give rise to an interactive dialogue. Until such an\r\ninteractive dialogue comes about, would it not be\r\npossible for the Council to devote a meeting to\r\nanalysing comments, criticisms and proposals relating\r\nto the report? In that respect, we welcome the Council\r\nPresident’s invitation to the General Assembly to\r\nengage in in-depth analysis of the report and his\r\nassurance that members of the Council would take our\r\ncomments and observations into consideration. His\r\ninvitation and his assurances would in that way be\r\nmeaningful.\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nThese few remarks and preliminary comments\r\nlead me to the substance of my statement, which\r\nconcerns Africa in the Security Council.\r\nDuring the period under review, Africa has\r\ncontinued to occupy a prominent place on the Council’s\r\nagenda. Africa’s problems have continued to be\r\ndiscussed in the Council, sometimes at the very highest\r\nlevel. The results, it has to be said, have not always\r\nbeen commensurate with the great hopes engendered in\r\nour peoples by the news that these discussions and\r\nmeetings would take place.\r\nAfrica has also given the Council the opportunity\r\nto deepen its holistic view of peace. For instance, the\r\nCouncil held a meeting on AIDS and its impact on\r\npeace and security.\r\nBut most importantly, over the course of this\r\nyear, the Council has developed a new vision of its\r\nrelationship with Africa. For instance, on 15 December\r\n1999, it convened a public meeting devoted to the\r\npartnership between the United Nations and Africa.\r\nReading with African eyes the report of the Security\r\nCouncil we have before us brings me back to this\r\nessential partnership.\r\nAlthough Africa is the region of our planet that is\r\nmost ravaged by armed conflict, it can and must have a\r\nbetter future — a future of peace and prosperity. Its\r\npartnership with the United Nations and therefore with\r\nthe Security Council is therefore not only a possibility\r\nbut a vital necessity.\r\nAfrican problems have always had an impact on\r\ninternational peace and security. The enormous\r\nresources of our continent have tempted many. Africa\r\nis indeed a heavyweight in every sense. Thus the\r\npartnership I am talking about should have as its first\r\npriority the field of peacekeeping and security.\r\nPeacekeeping involves conflict prevention and conflict\r\nsettlement through, among other things, the\r\ndeployment of peacekeeping and peace-building\r\noperations. Action in this area — that is to say,\r\npeacekeeping — is the responsibility, according to the\r\nCharter, of the Security Council. But to be effective,\r\nsuch action must involve Africa, be carried out with its\r\nconsent and be undertaken with its full cooperation.\r\nI said earlier that Africa rejected the idea of fate\r\nand of resignation. In fact, each of the major\r\nsubregions of our continent has developed a specific\r\nstructure for conflict prevention, settlement and\r\nmanagement. In Central Africa, the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States set up the\r\nCouncil for Peace and Security in Central Africa,\r\nassisted by a Central African multinational force\r\nresponsible for peacekeeping operations.\r\nIn West Africa, the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) has set up a Mediation\r\nand Security Council and a Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG). In southern Africa, the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) has an ad hoc\r\narrangement responsible for peace and security which,\r\non a case-by-case basis, decides on the deployment of\r\nsubregional forces. In East Africa, we have the Inter-\r\nGovernment Authority on Development (IGAD).\r\nAlong with these subregional agencies, we have a\r\nspecific Organization of African Unity (OAU) body\r\nresponsible for conflict prevention and settlement.\r\nAll of this demonstrates that Africa possesses\r\nstructures whose capabilities must be strengthened by\r\nthe Security Council if the latter truly wishes to\r\nmaintain international peace and security in Africa.\r\nOur continent is a partner that is capable,\r\ninstitutionally speaking, of meeting the requirements of\r\nArticles 52 and 53 of Chapter VIII of the Charter. What\r\nis required is to improve and consolidate regional\r\nmeasures in the areas of conflict prevention, early\r\nwarning and peacekeeping. Such a strengthening of\r\nAfrica’s capacities should also involve financial\r\nsupport for peace agreements. This is self-evident.\r\nLet us recall that in other regions of the world the\r\nsigning of such agreements always goes hand in hand\r\nwith a financial arrangement to address in particular\r\nthe social problems that may arise. Any peace\r\nagreement that does not provide for such a financial\r\narrangement has the seeds of insecurity embedded in it.\r\nWhat future could there be for a peace agreement if,\r\nfor example, no provision were made for the\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants? What future would a\r\npeace agreement have with no provision made for child\r\nsoldiers?\r\nI wish to conclude by inviting the Security\r\nCouncil to reflect upon the idea of appointing someone\r\nwhom we might describe as an Africa coordinator to\r\nwork with the Secretary-General. That person’s task\r\nwould be to secure full implementation of the\r\nrequirements of Article 54 of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, for that Article requires that the Security\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nCouncil shall at all times be kept fully informed of\r\nactivities undertaken or in contemplation under\r\nregional arrangements or by regional agencies for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Such a\r\ncoordinator’s job would also be to act as an interface\r\nbetween the Secretary-General and African leaders.\r\nLastly, the Africa coordinator would be responsible for\r\nassisting the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly in implementing the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General contained in his report on the\r\nconditions for lasting peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nToday we have before us the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, the organ responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Africa\r\nis the region of the world that is hardest hit by these\r\nconflicts. That situation, as I said earlier, is not\r\ndetermined by fate. Africa rejects the idea of fate.\r\nAllow me to recall the Secretary-General’s\r\nstatement to the Security Council of 29 September\r\n1999:\r\n“However imperfectly, Africans have\r\nprovided many important signs of their own\r\nyearning for peace, stability and development and\r\ntheir willingness to work for it. The right kind of\r\nsupport now, carefully directed to those best able\r\nto use it, could help Africans turn a corner and set\r\nthe stage for a brighter future. Let us seize this\r\nmoment.” (S/PV.4049, p. 5)\r\nAt a time when the Assembly is about to take\r\naction on the report of the Security Council, let us act\r\nin such a way as to ensure that the Security Council\r\nhelps Africa to be its partner for and in the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security.\r\nMr. Lacanilao (Philippines): First of all, the\r\nPhilippine delegation would like to thank Ambassador\r\nMartin Andjaba of Namibia for his lucid presentation\r\nof the report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly at this session. The Philippine delegation\r\nalso extends its congratulations to the delegations of\r\nColombia, Ireland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore\r\nfor their recent election to the five non-permanent\r\nCouncil seats that will be vacated at the end of this\r\nyear. The Philippine delegation is convinced that these\r\nincoming members will make a positive contribution to\r\nthe future work of the Council.\r\nThe General Assembly considers the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council every year during its\r\nregular session, when Member States engage in their\r\nannual ritual of delivering statements, making\r\nobservations and more or less providing sophisticated\r\nanalyses of the manner in which the Council conducted\r\nits business in the previous year.\r\nThis yearly exercise has its function and purpose,\r\nwhich is to allow States not members of the Security\r\nCouncil to air their views on the work done by the\r\nCouncil over the past year. But it also typifies the\r\ngrowing chasm between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. There has been palpable discontent\r\nin what has been said from this podium on how the\r\nCouncil seems to conduct its business on a daily basis,\r\nalmost oblivious to the general sentiments of other\r\nMember States.\r\nWhile this proposition could be a topic for intense\r\ndebate, it is a fact that the only chance for States not\r\nmembers of the Council to express their views on the\r\nCouncil’s work amounts to a grand total of one or two\r\nmeeting days in the Assembly’s regular session. It is\r\ntherefore not difficult to imagine that the two bodies —\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council —\r\nwould seem out of step with each other on important\r\nissues. If the United Nations wants to face the\r\nchallenges of the future more effectively, the divide\r\nthat grows ever wider between the Security Council\r\nand the general membership of this Organization must\r\nbe bridged. This could be achieved in various ways.\r\nRegular consultations must be conducted between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council,\r\nparticularly on the exercise of the Council’s\r\nextraordinary enforcement powers under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter. The imposition of sanctions and the\r\nfinalization of peacekeeping mandates are important\r\nissues on which consultations would be both beneficial\r\nand necessary. Experience has shown that sanctions\r\nhave had some harmful effects on the civilian\r\npopulation and third States. Some sanctions regimes\r\nhave been on the books for several years but have little\r\nto show in terms of achieving the political objective for\r\nwhich they were intended — to change the conduct of\r\nerring Governments and regimes. In the meantime,\r\nsanctions have imposed a heavy toll on civilian\r\npopulations and third States.\r\nTo be effective and just, the imposition of\r\nsanctions must have the broad support of the Member\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nStates of the United Nations. While unanimity of view\r\nwould not be a realistic goal, the Security Council must\r\nobtain the support of a critical mass of the United\r\nNations Members if any sanctions regime is to be\r\nestablished. This is a practical consideration if the\r\nintegrity and the fairness of the sanctions regime are to\r\nbe upheld.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity is a core function of the United Nations.\r\nPeacekeeping is an integral cog in the mechanism. It is\r\nin peacekeeping where the partnership of countries for\r\nthe cause of peace finds tangible expression. Where\r\npersonnel resources for peacekeeping become critically\r\nshort, as has tended to happen in recent years, the\r\ncontribution of even small countries becomes\r\nindispensable. In the last few years, we have seen\r\npeacekeeping, from Dili town to Freetown, become\r\ntransformed permanently. Peacekeeping has evolved in\r\nsuch a way that it cannot be sustained unless it receives\r\na fair amount of support from the broad membership of\r\nthe United Nations. Not one country, no matter how\r\npowerful, could be the world’s policeman. Alas and\r\nalack, global peace and stability can be realized only\r\nthrough the sincere partnership of all.\r\nIt is in this context that consultations between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council find\r\npolitical significance. More transparency on the part of\r\nthe Council would enhance the trust and confidence of\r\nMember States with regard to it and its work on\r\nmatters of importance to the international community.\r\nSuch openness would provide more political support to\r\nthe Council, which would augur well for the\r\nachievement of global peace.\r\nThe Philippine delegation commends the Security\r\nCouncil on its initiative during the past year to become\r\nmore transparent and open in its work. Many of us\r\nhave had the chance to participate in a number of open\r\nCouncil meetings and briefings on various issues of\r\nsignificance to the United Nations. Regular briefings\r\nhave also been given by the President of the Council on\r\nthe results of the Council’s informal consultations. The\r\nCouncil has also conducted dialogue with\r\ntroop-contributing countries on many occasions, which\r\nhas helped a great deal in communicating needs and\r\nresolving difficulties in specific mission areas. This\r\npractice is a step in the right direction towards making\r\nthe process of deploying United Nations peace\r\nmissions fully participatory and consultative.\r\nWhile this trend is heartening, the path to full\r\npartnership between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly remains steep and arduous. Much\r\nwould need to be done to overcome the general feeling\r\nof resentment that the Security Council has become a\r\nprivate club that conducts private meetings to the\r\nexclusion of the general membership of the United\r\nNations. A genuine mechanism of interaction and\r\nconsultation between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly must be established. The work for\r\npeace is not a zero-sum game, where one body must\r\nwork to the exclusion of all others. There must be room\r\nfor everyone’s contribution if the United Nations is to\r\nattain its cherished goal of peace and progress for all.\r\nAlthough the General Assembly will debate this\r\nissue about a month from now, the question of Security\r\nCouncil reform inevitably comes to the fore when its\r\nwork is under consideration by the General Assembly.\r\nAt this stage, when the United Nations has 189\r\nsovereign States in its roster of Members, it would\r\nappear pertinent to question whether the present\r\nnumber and structure of Security Council membership\r\nstill fully and fairly represent the interests of the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations. With only\r\nfive of its members having a permanent tenure in the\r\nCouncil, while the other 184 Members have to wait\r\ntheir turn to fill up the 10 non-permanent seats for a\r\ntwo-year term, the United Nations has continued to be\r\na crudely lopsided Organization. One wonders how this\r\ninternal balance could be sustained for long without\r\npermanently damaging the ability of the United\r\nNations to fulfil its mandate.\r\nThe present arrangement and set-up of the\r\nSecurity Council were concocted 55 years ago, when\r\nmany who are present in this Hall today were not yet\r\nborn. More significantly, it was a time when the world\r\nand the United Nations were confronted with different\r\nchallenges and realities from what they face today. It is\r\ntime to seriously review and then change the present\r\nparadigm.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council has been on\r\nthe table of the Open-ended Working Group for the last\r\nseven long years. We need to rekindle the fire, to move\r\nthe Working Group along at a quicker pace. We cannot\r\nwait another 55 years for the Working Group to provide\r\nanswers to the question of Security Council reform.\r\nWorld events will not have the patience to tolerate our\r\nhesitation and endless posturing on this issue.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): Allow me first to express\r\nmy delegation’s sincere thanks to Ambassador Martin\r\nAndjaba, Permanent Representative of Namibia, for his\r\nlucid introduction of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly. The long report\r\nreflects both the range and the complexity of work the\r\nSecurity Council had to undertake during the period\r\nunder review. The Security Council deserves our\r\nappreciation for painstakingly compiling the report and\r\npresenting it to the general membership, in accordance\r\nwith the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe fact that two of the four missions launched\r\nduring this period — in Kosovo and East Timor —\r\nwere in the realm of nation-building confirms the\r\nmultiplicity of challenges the United Nations faces in\r\nkeeping the peace. Over the years, there has been a\r\nconsistent demand by the general membership to make\r\nthe Security Council more transparent and democratic\r\nin its functions and more representative in its structure.\r\nJudging from the present state of affairs, we have\r\nbarely scratched the surface, and much remains to be\r\ndone to achieve those fundamental goals.\r\nNepal duly appreciates that some progress has\r\nbeen made in the procedural reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Under the Charter, Member States have\r\nconferred on the Council the primary responsibility of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, the\r\nresponsibility the Council undertakes on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership. It is therefore the obligation of\r\nthe Council to take the non-Council members into\r\nconfidence by consulting them and keeping them\r\ninformed every step of the way. Our powerful friends\r\nwho are represented on the Security Council without\r\nfacing elections have, in fact, a moral obligation to pay\r\nparticular attention to making the process more\r\ndemocratic.\r\nIn this context, the open briefings for non-\r\nCouncil members and private meetings with the troop-\r\ncontributing countries, though certainly welcome\r\ndevelopments, are far from sufficient, for they do not\r\nprovide an opportunity for non-Council members to\r\ncontribute their views and perspectives in order to\r\nmake peacekeeping and peacemaking more effective.\r\nThe open debates, on the other hand, seldom have\r\nmuch bearing on real decisions of the Council in real\r\nsituations. Undoubtedly, they make abundant sense as\r\nan academic exercise with lofty philosophical\r\nflourishes. What non-Council members are asking for\r\nis not theoretical discourses, but rather the opportunity\r\nto share their perspectives, contribute their input and\r\noffer their advice in a process in which they have a\r\ngreat stake. It might not be possible to hold prior\r\nconsultation with non-Council members in emergency\r\nsituations, but it would only be just and fair for\r\nMember States to be consulted before they are asked to\r\nput the lives of their personnel on the line and to\r\ncommit their resources. After all, the democratic\r\nprinciple, which we all tout, warrants that Member\r\nStates are given voice and information before they are\r\nasked to make their commitments to take risks. The\r\nformal meetings, used only to formalize the decisions\r\narrived at in informal meetings held behind closed\r\ndoors, have remained mere formalities of no\r\nsubstantive significance.\r\nIt is imperative that the Council apply objective\r\ncriteria when deciding to mount an operation. It is\r\nworrying, however, that there are ample examples\r\nwhere the Security Council has not been even-handed\r\nin addressing peace and security issues. Often, the\r\nnational interests of certain Members have outweighed\r\nthe larger interests of regional and global peace. This is\r\nespecially agonizing for small States, whose security\r\ndepends for the most part on the Security Council. The\r\nRwanda report of the International Panel of Eminent\r\nPersonalities indicates that clearly.\r\nOne major issue that greatly concerns us is that of\r\nsanctions. While they are a useful Charter-mandated\r\ntool, wide-ranging impacts require that they be applied\r\ncarefully and sparingly. Frequently sanctions cripple\r\ninnocent people in countries on which they are\r\nimposed, and not those whom they are meant to affect.\r\nAt the same time, sanctions frequently hurt third\r\ncountries and make them innocent victims as well. If\r\nthey are to be imposed at all, sanctions should be\r\ntailor-made to hit the target, not the surroundings.\r\nFurthermore, if sanctions hurt innocent third countries,\r\nthere must be a provision to compensate them for any\r\nundue suffering and loss that they incur.\r\nWe commend the courage of the Brahimi Panel,\r\nwhich has boldly pointed out where the blame lies. It\r\nalso points to the ambiguous and unrealistic mandates\r\nthat were responsible for the failure of a number of\r\nmissions. In addition, the Panel’s report (A/55/305)\r\noffers a number of useful recommendations to revamp\r\nthe management of peace and to minimize failures in\r\nthe future.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nOur leaders reaffirmed at the recent historic\r\nMillennium Summit the need to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity more effectively. They resolved to strengthen\r\nrespect for the rule of law in international affairs and to\r\nmake the United Nations more effective by giving it\r\nthe resources and tools it needs to do its tasks.\r\nIf we are to realize the vision of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, we need comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Nepal is open to an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council based on a ratifiable consensus. We\r\nbelieve, though, that there is a crying need for the\r\ngeneral membership to feel confident that the reformed\r\nCouncil will be more democratic, more transparent,\r\nmore representative and more accountable. Member\r\nStates must be able to see these qualities in the\r\napproach and deeds of the Security Council while the\r\nreform proposals are under consideration.\r\nHumanitarian intervention has been one of the\r\ncontentious subjects. We have spoken at length on this\r\nissue before, and we remain firm in our position.\r\nIt is time to ask ourselves: how long can we\r\nafford to go without effectively addressing the root\r\ncauses of conflicts? Most conflicts, as we know, have\r\ntheir genesis in poverty and social exclusion.\r\nInvestment in education, health and poverty\r\nreduction can produce dramatic results in promoting a\r\ndurable peace. The Security Council should work in\r\npartnership with the Economic and Social Council, as\r\nwell as with other relevant organs and agencies, to help\r\naddress these issues. It must exercise restraint, resisting\r\nthe temptation to go beyond the scope of its mandate,\r\nwhich stretches it thinly, vitiates its effectiveness and\r\nundermines the other competent bodies.\r\nThe obligation arising from the trust that the\r\ngeneral membership places in the Security Council has\r\nto be fulfilled with the utmost care, so that the General\r\nAssembly is not neglected or sidelined.\r\nBefore I conclude, I heartily congratulate\r\nColombia, Ireland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore\r\non their well-deserved recent election to the Security\r\nCouncil. I am confident that the new members will\r\nwork to make the Council more responsive to the\r\nexpectations of the membership, whose trust they\r\nembody as its elected representatives.\r\nMr. Mutaboba (Rwanda): I am grateful for this\r\nopportunity to participate in the debate on the work of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nI start by warmly congratulating the newly\r\nelected members of the Security Council: Columbia,\r\nIreland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore. My\r\ndelegation looks forward to collaborating with them\r\nand lending them our full support during their term of\r\noffice. We encourage them to work with those they\r\nrepresent on the Council, rather than seeking to defend\r\ntheir national interests as many members have done in\r\nthe past — whether wrongly or rightly is debatable,\r\nand I do not wish to engage in such a debate.\r\n“Transparency” and “objectivity” are the words that\r\nshould guide them all, and, based on what we know\r\nabout their distinguished work at the United Nations,\r\nwe trust them to do even better than those who\r\npreceded them.\r\nI take this opportunity to also congratulate the\r\nCouncil members on their visits on the ground to\r\nvarious conflict zones. We believe that in this way they\r\ncan learn more and make their decisions wisely.\r\nMy delegation has read with care the report on\r\nthe work of the Security Council, and we congratulate\r\nthe Council’s Presidents on representing that body and\r\non the work well done. However, much more remains\r\nto be done, and to be corrected, in the Council’s efforts\r\nto keep improving on its output. On the basis of the bad\r\nexperiences of Rwanda, my delegation suggests that\r\nreports on the work of the Security Council include six\r\nimportant things: first, the duties assigned to the\r\nCouncil in the field of ensuring international peace and\r\nsecurity; secondly, the means available for fulfilling\r\nthe Council’s duties; thirdly, periodic assessments of\r\nthe work done and difficulties encountered in the\r\naccomplishment of its tasks; fourthly, decisions and\r\naction taken, where, how and why; fifthly, lessons\r\nlearned from given missions; and, sixthly, a plan of\r\naction for the future.\r\nThat would give a skeleton for the objective and\r\nrealistic report that members of the Assembly would\r\nlike to read, as opposed to the routine format, which\r\ndoes not reflect the realities, neither in the fields of\r\noperation nor at Secretariat Headquarters itself.\r\nIt is time for the Security Council to reform and\r\nreflect the membership of the General Assembly on\r\nbehalf of which it is supposed to be taking on work and\r\nreporting back to. It is time for the Council’s members\r\nto do some introspection, put their hands on their\r\nhearts and ask themselves “Have we done what we\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nought to do, and have we done it in the best, objective\r\nway?” and many more questions.\r\nThis set of questions is important to all when we\r\nremember that, in the case of Rwanda, the\r\nrepresentative of the genocidal Government was busy\r\nmisinforming the members about the situation on the\r\nground and that he was listened to all along. In the\r\nfuture, the Council should candidly come out as one to\r\nsuspend the attendance of a member of the Council\r\nwhen deliberating on issues in which that Council\r\nmember is directly involved. On another level, it\r\nshould be remembered that a flip of the pen from the\r\nSecurity Council could have saved lives in Rwanda\r\nsimply by changing the mandate of the United Nations\r\nMission in Rwanda and/or by reinforcing the troops\r\nand arming them through the same heavy carriers that\r\nlanded in Kigali to evacuate those who were supposed\r\nto save lives.\r\nThe Carlsson report and the report of the\r\nInternational Panel of Eminent Personalities issued by\r\nthe Organization of African Unity have described in\r\ndetail what went wrong and made recommendations\r\nthat ought to be implemented.\r\nThe time has come for the Security Council to\r\nbypass the individual interests of some members that\r\nstill have the ear of others which may fear breaking old\r\nalliances and the gentlemen’s agreements that send\r\nsome to one place or another and allow others to\r\noperate elsewhere. The victims of such sordid\r\narrangements and transactions dictated by personal\r\ngain or so-called national interests have a lot to tell.\r\nHowever, not having to tell or to hear such tragic and\r\notherwise avoidable stories would be a success for the\r\nCouncil and it can correct the trend now that the\r\nBrahimi report has touched the right chord.\r\nMy delegation has never believed that a soft\r\nlanding is impossible for the military or for the\r\nSecurity Council in establishing peacekeeping\r\noperations wherever they are needed. The time has\r\ncome for the Council to report on choices made in\r\ndifferent cases — especially, in the case of Rwanda, in\r\nthe area of sanctions and arms embargoes such as those\r\nimposed on the génocidaires, the Interahamwe and the\r\nmembers of the former Forces Armées Rwandaises,\r\nwho nevertheless still enjoy support across borders —\r\nand to ensure objectivity and transparency throughout\r\nits work and decisions. This will bring us together as\r\ntrusting members of the same family.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the\r\nreport of the Security Council, contained in document\r\nA/55/2?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 11.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nletter from the Netherlands on agenda item 181\r\n(A/55/495)\r\nThe President: Document A/55/495 contains a\r\nletter dated 18 October 2000 addressed to the President\r\nof the General Assembly from the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Netherlands regarding agenda\r\nitem 181, entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons”.\r\nMembers will recall that the General Assembly,\r\nat its 35th plenary meeting on 17 October 2000,\r\ndecided to include this item on its agenda and to\r\nconsider the item directly in plenary meeting. In this\r\nconnection, the Permanent Representative of the\r\nNetherlands in his letter requests that the item be\r\nconsidered on Friday, 20 October 2000. He further\r\nstates that, as was pointed out in his earlier letter and\r\nexplanatory memorandum on the subject, contained in\r\ndocument A/55/234, this agenda item is of an urgent\r\ncharacter, as the Relationship Agreement between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons was signed on 17\r\nOctober 2000. It would be befitting for the General\r\nAssembly to react as soon as possible to the important\r\nevent of the signing of that Agreement. He therefore\r\nrequests a waiver of the seven-day period that must\r\nelapse after the additional item is placed on the agenda,\r\nas required by rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI should now like to consult delegations with\r\nregard to scheduling the consideration of agenda item\r\n181 for tomorrow, Friday, 20 October 2000.\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nI should like to draw members’ attention to the\r\nrelevant provision of rule 15 of the rules of procedure\r\nof the General Assembly, which reads as follows:\r\n“No additional item may, unless the General\r\nAssembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds\r\nmajority of the members present and voting, be\r\nconsidered until seven days have elapsed since it\r\nwas placed on the agenda and until a committee\r\nhas reported upon the question concerned.”\r\nIn the absence of objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees to schedule the consideration of\r\nagenda item 181 for tomorrow, Friday, 20 October\r\n2000.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In his letter, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Netherlands further states that it\r\nwould be desirable for the Director-General of the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,\r\nwho signed the Agreement, to participate in the debate.\r\nHe therefore requests that the Director-General be\r\ngiven the opportunity to address the General Assembly.\r\nIn the absence of objection, may I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to hear the Director-General\r\nof the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons under agenda item 181 on Friday, 20 October\r\n2000?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Agenda item 181 will be\r\nconsidered in the morning of Friday, 20 October 2000,\r\nas the second item. The list of speakers for agenda item\r\n181 is now open.\r\nAgenda item 31\r\nElimination of coercive economic measures as a\r\nmeans of political and economic compulsion\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/55/300 and\r\nAdd.1 and Add.2)\r\nDraft resolution (A/55/L.9)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat, in a letter dated 21 September 2000 addressed to\r\nthe President of the General Assembly, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Sweden to the United Nations, in his\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and Other States for the month of September,\r\nrequests that the General Assembly hear in plenary\r\nmeeting a statement by the observer of the Holy See in\r\nthe debate on agenda item 31.\r\nTaking into account the importance attached to\r\nthe issue under discussion, it is proposed that the\r\nGeneral Assembly should take a decision on that\r\nrequest.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the\r\nproposal to hear the observer of the Holy See in the\r\ndebate on agenda item 31?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Dorda (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The item before the Assembly, submitted by\r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, does not concern Libya\r\nalone, but the whole international community — all the\r\nMember States in the United Nations. This item deals\r\nessentially with contraventions and radical violations\r\nof the norms of international law, the United Nations\r\nCharter and the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights: one State decides through its legislative\r\nauthorities to enact a law and proceeds to impose the\r\nimplementation of that law outside its territorial\r\njurisdiction. It imposes on all States of the world a law\r\nthat only serves its own private interests. This State has\r\nmade itself a god instead of God in the heavens.\r\nInstead of Allah, the only God who should be\r\nworshipped, it made itself a new god on this planet and\r\nwants to enslave everyone as if they were a herd of\r\nanimals. No people other than this State have any will,\r\nrights or interests; everything belongs to this State.\r\nThis is madness, nothing more.\r\nLibya is not the only State concerned by the\r\nactivities dealt with in the draft resolution before you.\r\nFor the past 30 years, Libya has not cooperated with\r\nthe United States, nor has the United States cooperated\r\nwith Libya. We have survived nevertheless —\r\nindependent, free on our land, free to make our\r\ndecisions and determine our positions. We do not\r\naccept directions from that country’s leadership,\r\nministers or its ambassadors. Thank God for that.\r\nLibya lost half of its people, 750,000 individuals,\r\nas martyrs in order to achieve independence. We are\r\nnot ready to give up the memory of these martyrs in\r\norder to praise America or any other power on earth.\r\nThey punished us by attacking our airspace, our\r\nterritorial waters and our cities, yet we were not\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nsubjugated. They have imposed a unilateral embargo\r\nagainst us, yet we have not been subjugated. They have\r\nimposed an international embargo on us through the\r\nUnited Nations, in the name of international legitimacy,\r\nfor an accusation that has still not been proven. Even in\r\nthe Scottish court, which is being held in the\r\nNetherlands, they have not provided one piece of\r\nevidence or proof against the two Libyan suspects.\r\nThey will not be able to do that simply because neither\r\nLibya nor the two Libyan suspects had any\r\ninvolvement in that incident.\r\nNone of these acts succeeded in subjugating\r\nLibya. What did they do? They enacted laws, not to\r\npunish Libya only, but also to punish anybody who\r\ncooperates with free countries such as Libya, Korea,\r\nIraq and Cuba — those States that have not\r\nsurrendered. This act is not in fact directed against\r\nLibya or the countries that I have mentioned or those\r\nthat I have not mentioned; it is directed against any\r\ncorporation or country that cooperates with these\r\ncountries.\r\nA week ago I was in Cuba. I visited a tourist city\r\nconsidered one of the four most important tourist\r\nplaces in the world. It was financed by a Spanish\r\ninvestor. This Spanish investor, who established the\r\ntourist city, was threatened and asked not to implement\r\nthis important project. Of course, he did not give up.\r\nThey told him then that his investments in Florida\r\nwould be halted. He said that he would give up his\r\ninvestments in Florida. They sanctioned a businessman,\r\nan investor from Europe, because he tried to invest in\r\nCuba.\r\nThe United States is against Cuba, but Spain is\r\nnot against Cuba. This investor is not an adversary of\r\nCuba. Cuba is still there after 40 years of American\r\nembargo. This neighbouring country is still there. It\r\nsurvives as a free State and will continue as such\r\nforever.\r\nThis is unjust. This is an aggression against all\r\ninternational norms and agreements. Because Libya is a\r\nfree State, it stands before you and sponsors such a\r\ndraft resolution. Libya is not subject to anybody but\r\nGod. Whatever will be will be, we will not be\r\nsubjugated.\r\nWe are not against them, they are against us. We\r\nhave not hurt their interests, they are hurting ours. We\r\nhave not aggressed against them, they have aggressed\r\nagainst us. We have not severed diplomatic relations,\r\nthey have severed diplomatic relations. We have not\r\nissued a single resolution imposing economic sanctions\r\nagainst them, they have done that. We are still living,\r\nfree masters on our own land.\r\nThese unilateral legal acts, which are meant to be\r\nimplemented extraterritorially against the country in\r\nquestion, are directed against developed countries,\r\nagainst industrialized countries, essentially against the\r\ncountries of the European Union and Japan, countries\r\nthat have made great advances in development and\r\ntechnology and that have great corporations in all areas\r\nof economic activity.\r\nMr. Pradhan (Bhutan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nLibya is sponsoring this draft resolution on behalf\r\nof the General Assembly, and calls upon the General\r\nAssembly to vote for it, even if its format does not\r\nplease everyone. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is very\r\npractical, realistic and flexible. We are open to any\r\namendments that may be suggested and are ready to\r\naccept any ideas or viewpoints as long as they do not\r\nnullify the purpose of the draft resolution. If it is\r\nthought that we are referring to a specific measure, we\r\nreply that we are referring only to the unilateral\r\ndecisions that target extra-territorial jurisdiction over\r\nany State, a matter that could be reflected in the title of\r\nthe draft resolution or in its substance. We are prepared\r\nto discuss that, because we want the draft resolution to\r\nbe adopted unanimously, since it deals with, and\r\ntouches, all of us. What I said about the Spanish\r\ninvestor emphatically concerns all investors,\r\ncorporations and countries. Furthermore, we should not\r\nallow a precedent whereby one single State directs the\r\nentire Assembly and we all become subjugated to it.\r\nAs I stated last year, some simple-minded and\r\ngood-hearted people believed when the international\r\nbalance of power shifted — and I do not mean the end\r\nof the cold war — that the world would witness a phase\r\nof peace, stability, reconstruction and so on, but the last\r\ndecade, even if it did not witness a cold war, witnessed\r\nmany hot wars, disputes and conflicts, in which\r\nmissiles were used because of an internal problem.\r\nBattleships, aircraft and many other weapons were used\r\nin some of those conflicts and new weapons were tried\r\nout. This is not new for Libya. In our case, the new\r\nweapon was an economic embargo that has resulted in\r\nmillions of victims, more than the victims of previous\r\nwars.\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nIf the Assembly agrees, I propose that we delay\r\nthe vote until the beginning of next week. As I have\r\nsaid, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is quite ready to\r\naccept any amendments presented by any delegation as\r\nlong as such amendments do not change the essence or\r\npurpose of the draft resolution.\r\nWe should agree, because this matter does not\r\nrelate exclusively to Libya. Libya has survived a\r\nunilateral economic embargo, and continues to do so.\r\nAll our assets in the United States, whether liquid or\r\nmobile, have been frozen. They include the\r\nheadquarters of our mission on 48th Street, the\r\nAmbassador’s house in New Jersey and even our liquid\r\ncash. The account of the Libyan Mission to the United\r\nNations has not been opened as of now, yet we survive.\r\nWe are not wrong. This embargo and the legislation\r\nand laws actually affect the Assembly, not Libya.\r\nLibya has no ambition to find reconciliation with\r\nthe United States and will not ask or beg for it. The\r\nAmericans, both verbally and in written documents,\r\nasked us to preserve the United States interests in\r\nLibyan oil companies when they discovered that\r\nEuropean oil companies were coming to Libya after the\r\nsuspension of the embargo. That is what the Americans\r\nwant for their oil companies and those companies that\r\nhave interests in natural gas. Libya is flexible, realistic\r\nand practical, and it is not against or opposed to any\r\nState. We have not committed aggression against any\r\nState, but we will not beg.\r\nI call upon the States that wish to comment to do\r\nso openly, and we will wholeheartedly discuss any\r\namendments after receiving permission from\r\nrepresentatives who voted with us in the last two years,\r\nnamely, members of the Organization of African Unity,\r\nthe League of Arab States, the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nand many other organizations, as well as countries that\r\ndo not belong to these groups, including members of\r\nthe Group of 77. We ask them to agree to our flexible\r\nrequest so that the draft resolution can be adopted\r\nunanimously. This draft resolution expresses the views\r\nof the international community vis-à-vis a country that\r\nwants to impose its internal legislation on the whole\r\nworld.\r\nMr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\nMillennium Summit Declaration, the discussions held\r\nby heads of State and Government of Member States as\r\npart of the Summit, and the general political debates of\r\nthis session give eloquent proof of the significance of\r\nthe problem we are discussing.\r\nAs we move from one century and one\r\nmillennium to the next we are reaching an\r\nunderstanding of how essential it is that we institute\r\nradical changes to the way in which we approach the\r\napplication of coercive measures. The fairness of the\r\nwording of the Charter in this respect can, and must, be\r\nadapted to the realities of the world today. The past\r\nyear can be seen as a milestone in the process of\r\nestablishing the United Nations conceptual approach to\r\nthe use of sanctions as a means for economic\r\ncompulsion. We have seen wide-ranging discussion in\r\nthe Security Council on this issue and the successful\r\nstudy of the “Sanctions Decade” that took place with\r\nthe active participation of the Government of Canada.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Belarus is\r\npleased to note that the Security Council has been able\r\nto adopt for the first time in its history a resolution\r\nestablishing a specific period for the application of\r\nsanctions, whose effects, both political and economic,\r\nshould be very closely analysed and assessed. Belarus\r\nalso welcomes the establishment, under the Security\r\nCouncil, of an informal working group on sanctions,\r\nand we hope that its work will be closely studied and\r\napplied in a mandatory way, not only by the members\r\nof the Security Council, but by the Organization as a\r\nwhole.\r\nIt is no accident that the international community\r\nis focusing now on the problem of sanctions. After the\r\nend of the Second World War sanctions were a very\r\npowerful way of applying pressure on States, in order\r\nto procure their full compliance with their duties under\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nHowever, experience has shown that the\r\nwholesale application of a formula established then for\r\nthose times has not always been crowned with success.\r\nA very clear example of this is the lamentable\r\nhumanitarian situation that has arisen because of harsh\r\ncoercive measures applied against Iraq. This has been\r\nconfirmed by research done by respected international\r\norganizations like the United Nations Children’s Fund,\r\nthe United Nations Office of the High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees, the World Health Organization and\r\nothers.\r\nOne of the priority tasks facing the international\r\ncommunity is to stop the suffering of the Iraqi people\r\nand the only way to do that is by lifting the sanctions.\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nOne important aspect of this problem is research on the\r\neffects of coercive economic measures on third\r\ncountries. For instance, work by economists of the\r\nRepublic of Belarus has shown the losses experienced\r\nby our economy as a result of the trade relations we\r\nhave had to forgo because of sanctions. We hope that\r\nclose study of this problem at the United Nations will\r\nlead us to a solution that is acceptable to all Member\r\nStates. In this respect, the initiative by the Czech\r\nRepublic to set up a group to study the various aspects\r\nof the impact of sanctions could be an effective\r\ninstrument for further action and proposals. Our\r\nexperience in establishing a group to analyse United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations suggests that we can\r\nhope for positive recommendations in this respect.\r\nIn conclusion I wish to note that the delegation of\r\nBelarus welcomes active consideration by the Security\r\nCouncil of the factors involved in lifting or interrupting\r\nthe application of sanctions. We hope what has\r\nhappened with regard to Libya and Sudan will be the\r\nsubject of further discussions in the Council. A topic\r\nthat is becoming increasingly urgent is the practical\r\nresolution of the issue of lifting sanctions against the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. For its part, Belarus is\r\nready for productive work and cooperation on all\r\naspects of this problem as a part of the shared aims and\r\ngoals of the Members of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Dáusa Céspedes (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nCuba’s position on unilateral coercive measures\r\ndirected against developing countries has been and is\r\nwidely known. Consistent with that position, my\r\ndelegation voted in favour of resolution 53/10, adopted\r\nby the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, and\r\nwill vote in favour of the draft resolution before us\r\ntoday.\r\nAlso known is the growing rejection of such\r\ncoercive measures by the majority of the international\r\ncommunity, which had been expressed in many General\r\nAssembly resolutions. Nevertheless we still see an\r\ninternational order in which the main economic and\r\npolitical Power, exploiting its position of hegemony,\r\ncontinues to apply coercive economic measures against\r\ndeveloping countries unilaterally with the plain\r\nintention of imposing on them specific foreign policy\r\nobjectives of its own.\r\nOnce again, my Government vigorously\r\ncondemns the application of coercive measures that\r\nalso involve outright violation of international law and\r\nseriously violate principles of sovereign equality, non-\r\nintervention and non-interference in the internal affairs\r\nof sovereign States.\r\nAt the same time, the enactment of these\r\nmeasures reveals the genuine nature of the policies of\r\nthose countries that profess to be the champions of free\r\ntrade, but at the same time set up huge obstacles to free\r\ninternational trade, using it to try to unilaterally impose\r\ntheir national legislation on other countries, in blatant\r\ndisrespect of the principles of the Charter and\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe application of coercive economic measures\r\nas an instrument of political and economic compulsion\r\naffects the enjoyment of human rights by the peoples\r\nsubjected to these unilateral policies. The World\r\nConference on Human Rights and the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights have repeatedly called on States to\r\nrefrain from taking unilateral measures contrary to\r\ninternational law and the Charter, measures which\r\ncreate obstacles to trade relations among States and\r\nblock full enjoyment of the rights articulated in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and in\r\ninternational human rights instruments, in particular\r\nthe right of every individual to a decent standard of\r\nliving for health and well-being, including nutrition,\r\nhealth care, housing and the necessary social services.\r\nThe Conference on Human Rights also stated that food\r\nshould not be used as a means of political pressure.\r\nThe international community has consistently\r\nrejected the use of this policy and has ruled it to be a\r\nflagrant violation of the principles, objectives and\r\nnorms that govern international trade. Laws and\r\nprovisions, such as the Torricelli, Helms-Burton and\r\nD’Amato-Kennedy Acts, are incompatible with the\r\nagreements of the World Trade Organization and\r\nundermine efforts to maintain a multilateral trading\r\nsystem that is equitable, secure, non-discriminatory,\r\ntransparent and predictable.\r\nThe D’Amato-Kennedy Act, also known as the\r\nIran and Libya Sanctions Act, which imposes sanctions\r\non foreign investors in the oil sector of these two\r\ncountries, regardless of the nationality of those\r\ninvestors or the jurisdictions of the companies under\r\nwhich they operate, is devoid of any moral and legal\r\njustification, in terms of its political motives and the\r\nmeans it uses to carry out the capricious will of the\r\nUnited States Congress.\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Cuba once\r\nagain condemns all extraterritorial acts that violate the\r\nsovereignty of peoples and is confident in the role that\r\nthe United Nations can play to ensure fulfilment of the\r\nwill and the decisions of the international community.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): The use or\r\nthreat of use of coercive economic measures as a\r\nmeans of political and economic compulsion is a\r\nflagrant violation of the principles embodied in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law,\r\nparticularly in Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Charter\r\nstipulating that the Organization is based on the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of all its Members.\r\nSuch measures are likewise an outright violation\r\nof the principles established in a large number of\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions and international\r\nconventions. In particular, I would like to cite as an\r\nexample the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of\r\nStates, adopted in 1974, which states that\r\n“No State may use or encourage the use of\r\neconomic, political or any other type of measures\r\nto coerce another State in order to obtain from it\r\nthe subordination of the exercise of its sovereign\r\nrights.” (resolution 3281 (XXIX), article 32)\r\nAs another example, I also wish to cite General\r\nAssembly resolutions 51/22, adopted on 27 November\r\n1996, and 53/10, adopted on 26 October 1998. These\r\ntwo resolutions reaffirm the fact that every State has an\r\ninalienable right to economic and social development,\r\nas well as to the right to choose the economic, political\r\nand social system it deems best. Through these\r\nresolutions the Assembly expressed its concern over\r\nthe grave consequences of coercive economic measures\r\nused unilaterally and called on all States to repeal such\r\nlaws.\r\nThe use of coercive measures as a means of\r\npolitical and economic pressure, whether undertaken\r\nunilaterally or under the auspices of multilateral\r\norganizations, constitutes a genuine threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. It also deprives\r\npeoples of their fundamental rights. The hardships\r\nsuffered by the Palestinian people after the embargo\r\nimposed on their towns and villages by the Zionist\r\nentity, the suffering of the Cuban people that has now\r\ngone on for over 40 years, the hardships suffered by the\r\npeople of Yugoslavia, the suffering of the people of\r\nLibya in the last eight years and the suffering\r\nexperienced by the Iraqi people for the last 10 years all\r\nillustrate clearly that such measures are a flagrant\r\nviolation of fundamental human rights and the\r\nprinciples of international law and international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nThe continuous embargo imposed on the Iraqi\r\npeople by the United States in the name of the United\r\nNations in order to force our country to change its\r\npolicies and deprive it of its fundamental sovereign\r\nrights is a prime example of the use of coercive\r\neconomic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion. These sanctions are responsible\r\nfor the deaths of 1.5 million Iraqi citizens, including\r\n500,000 children. Every month 7,000 Iraqi children are\r\nkilled by these sanctions, which also cause tremendous\r\ndamage to the vital economic infrastructure of Iraq —\r\nand that does not even take into account the harm done\r\nto third countries.\r\nThe embargo imposed on Iraq has all the\r\ncharacteristics of genocide and constitutes a crime\r\nagainst humanity. Its continuation will only bring\r\ngreater instability to the region and to the world. This\r\nembargo brings shame upon the United Nations, whose\r\nmechanisms have been used to serve the hostile designs\r\nof American foreign policy.\r\nIn its foreign relations, the United States resorts\r\nto political and economic coercive measures more than\r\nany other country. Presently, the United States is\r\nimposing economic sanctions unilaterally or\r\nmultilaterally against over 70 countries around the\r\nworld. This is a breach of international law. Again, it is\r\nalso the United States that unilaterally resorts to the\r\nuse of brute force, thereby undermining the sovereignty\r\nand independence of other States. I am referring here to\r\nthe daily acts of aggression that the United States has\r\ncommitted since 1991 against Iraq in the guise of what\r\nit chooses to call no-flight zones. The United Kingdom\r\nalso takes part in those daily acts of aggression, along\r\nwith Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey, which provide\r\nbases for flights and logistical support for this\r\naggression.\r\nAllowing the policies of economic, political and\r\nmilitary hegemony to continue will ultimately\r\nundermine the fundamental legal pillars upon which\r\nthe international community rests today. I refer in\r\nparticular to the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nrules and principles relating to human rights. The\r\ninternational community and its bodies should take\r\nfirm and effective measures to end the policy of force\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nand stop the use of coercive economic and political\r\nmeasures. We therefore call urgently on all Member\r\nStates to vote in favour of the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted under this agenda item, as it marks a step\r\ntowards the restoration of the rule of law in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of South Africa, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): At the Twelfth\r\nConference of Heads of State or Government of the\r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Durban,\r\nSouth Africa, the heads of State or Government\r\ndeclared,\r\n“We must take up the challenge to\r\nfundamentally transform international relations,\r\nso as to eradicate aggression, racism, the use of\r\nforce, unilateral coercive measures and unfair\r\neconomic practices, foreign occupation and\r\nxenophobia in order to achieve a world of peace,\r\njustice and dignity for all.” (A/53/667, annex I,\r\nDurban Declaration for the New Millennium)\r\nAt that summit, the heads of State or Government\r\ncondemned the persistence by certain States in\r\nintensifying unilateral coercive measures and the\r\nexercise of domestic legislation with extraterritorial\r\neffects against developing countries. I am referring to\r\nactions that include blockades, embargoes and the\r\nfreezing of assets with the purpose of preventing those\r\ncountries from exercising the right to fully determine\r\ntheir political, economic and social systems and to\r\nfreely expand their international trade. We are\r\nconvinced of the need to contribute more effectively to\r\nincreasing the role of developing countries in the\r\ninternational economic system. Furthermore, the need\r\nfor equal and non-discriminatory rights for all\r\ncountries to join the international trading system and\r\nthe necessity to keep the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) and its membership procedure non-political and\r\neconomic-oriented cannot be overemphasized.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement firmly believes that\r\nincreased recourse by the major trading countries to\r\nactions such as extraterritorial measures are\r\nincompatible and in conflict with international rules\r\nand regulations agreed upon in the WTO. The\r\nunjustified and excessive use of anti-dumping measures\r\nto the detriment of the trade of developing countries is\r\na matter of great concern.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement also condemns the\r\ntrend geared towards strengthening coercive economic\r\nmeasures on developing countries. In this respect, we\r\nreaffirm that no State may use or encourage the use of\r\neconomic, political or any other type of measures to\r\ncoerce another State, including through the\r\nnon-extension of most-favoured nation trading status.\r\nWe also reject the expansion of such trends, and urge\r\nStates applying unilateral coercive measures to put an\r\nimmediate end to those measures.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement is concerned about\r\nthe adverse effects of the use of coercive economic\r\nmeasures on the economies and development efforts of\r\ndeveloping countries. We have no doubt that such\r\nmeasures have a broad negative impact on international\r\neconomic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to\r\nmove towards a non-discriminatory and open trading\r\nsystem.\r\nOur aim is to create a rules-based system where\r\nsmall and big nations will be treated as equal sovereign\r\nStates. We believe that such democratic reform is\r\nnecessary for all international institutions, including\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nAt the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, held at Cartagena in April\r\nthis year, the ministers called on all States not to\r\nrecognize unilateral extraterritorial laws enacted by\r\ncertain countries which impose sanctions on companies\r\nand individuals belonging to other countries. They\r\nwere of the view that such measures and legislation\r\nthreaten the sovereignty of States and adversely affect\r\ntheir social and economic development. Furthermore,\r\nthey marginalize developing countries from the process\r\nof globalization and are contrary to international law,\r\nthe principles and purposes of the United Nations\r\nCharter, the norms and principles governing peaceful\r\nrelations among States and agreed principles of the\r\nmultilateral trading system.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I wish at\r\nthe outset to endorse the statement just made by the\r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement on the item before us, “Elimination\r\nof coercive economic measures as a means of political\r\nand economic compulsion”. Most of the measures we\r\nare discussing today are sanctions, so I shall begin by\r\nspeaking of sanctions in general before turning to the\r\ninhumanity and illegality of measures of this kind.\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nParagraphs 99 to 101 of this year’s report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/55/1) show that the international community\r\ndisapproves of the negative impact of sanctions on\r\ncivilian populations, and indicate that it is peoples\r\nrather than Governments that normally pay the price.\r\nThat accords with something we should all recognize:\r\nwe ought to review the sanctions that the Security\r\nCouncil imposes.\r\nIf that is true of sanctions imposed by the United\r\nNations, how much more so must it be of coercive\r\nsanctions imposed by countries unilaterally and\r\narbitrarily for political reasons. Coercive economic\r\nmeasures are nothing other than a weapon used to\r\ndiscourage developing States from exercising freedom\r\nof choice about how they wish to develop in\r\nconsonance with their own cultural traditions. Such\r\ncoercive economic measures undermine international\r\nfree trade and technology transfers, which are the\r\ncommon heritage of mankind: inventions may be\r\nconceived in one country but are very often developed\r\nin another. Such measures harm, first and foremost, the\r\npeoples and the economies of developing countries.\r\nThe international community as a whole, as\r\nrepresented in the General Assembly, has repeatedly\r\nrejected any coercive laws with extraterritorial effects\r\nadopted by certain individual countries. Resolutions\r\n47/19, 48/16, 49/9, 50/10 and 51/17 all agree that\r\nStates should refrain from adopting or applying laws\r\nwith extraterritorial effects. Sudan firmly condemns the\r\nadoption of any such legislation, because it undermines\r\nthe noble principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\nof international law; these include non-interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of other States, and the right of\r\nevery State to choose its own path to development.\r\nSudan, itself a victim of such coercive measures,\r\ncalls upon States that have imposed sanctions to lift\r\nthem and to renounce their use as soon as possible, to\r\nshow their respect for the Charter of the United\r\nNations, for the right of States to sovereignty and for\r\nthe basic norms governing international relations.\r\nAnother purpose of the item before us is to\r\nimprove peace and prosperity for all peoples. My\r\ndelegation emphasizes that economic sanctions should\r\nnot be used to exert political pressure. We support draft\r\nresolution A/55/L.9 and will vote in its favour.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of\r\nIran): At the outset, let me thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on the agenda item entitled “Elimination\r\nof coercive economic measures as a means of political\r\nand economic compulsion” (A/55/300 and Add.1 and\r\n2). It is a brief report but a useful one.\r\nWe are living in an interdependent world. This\r\nhas been true for quite some time, and it will continue\r\nto affect our lives. In fact, as we all have recognized,\r\nthe process of globalization is actively expanding and\r\ndeepening the mutual interdependence of societies, and\r\nis reshaping the key features of world markets in\r\ncapital, goods, services, labour and technology. It has\r\nalso created numerous opportunities for international\r\ninteraction and cooperation. In such an environment,\r\nrecourse to unilateral and extraterritorial economic\r\ncoercive measures constitutes a major constraint on the\r\nexpansion of international cooperation and undermines\r\nthe basic principles and fundamentals of the\r\ninternational economic, trade and financial system.\r\nThe adoption of coercive economic measures falls\r\nwithin the mandate of the United Nations only in\r\nsituations where there exists a serious threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Unilateral and\r\nextraterritorial sanctions against other countries are\r\ninadmissible under international law. United Nations\r\nliterature against unilateral actions and extraterritorial\r\ncoercive measures is quite extensive.\r\nIn particular, the General Assembly on many\r\noccasions has expressed its disapproval of the\r\nunilateral and extraterritorial laws enacted by certain\r\nStates. The Assembly has found such acts to be in\r\nviolation of the principle of non-intervention and non-\r\ninterference in the internal and external affairs of other\r\nStates, as well as of the exercise of their sovereign\r\nrights. The resolution entitled “Unilateral economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\ncoercion against developing countries”, adopted at the\r\nforty-fourth, forty-sixth, forty-eighth, fiftieth and fifty-\r\nsecond sessions of the General Assembly, and the\r\nresolution entitled “Elimination of coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\nCompulsion”, adopted at the fifty-first and fifty-third\r\nsessions of the General Assembly, are prominent\r\nexamples of a series of United Nations reactions to\r\nsuch unlawful actions.\r\nSeveral relevant principles set forth in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations provide a solid basis for the\r\nOrganization to address the question of the exercise of\r\nunilateral sanctions by individual States. In this regard,\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nboth the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of\r\nIntervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the\r\nProtection of Their Independence and Sovereignty,\r\nadopted on 21 December 1965, and the Charter of\r\nEconomic Rights and Duties of States, adopted on 12\r\nDecember 1974, stipulate that\r\n“No State may use or encourage the use of\r\neconomic, political or any other type of measures\r\nto coerce another State in order to obtain from it\r\nthe subordination of the exercise of its sovereign\r\nrights or to secure from it advantages of any\r\nkind.”\r\nFurthermore, the imposition of coercive economic\r\nmeasures and the approval of domestic legislation with\r\nextraterritorial implications for the horizontal\r\nescalation of such actions and measures, also contradict\r\nestablished international trade law, including World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) regulations.\r\nVarious forms of economic coercive measures\r\nand actions have been imposed against 79 foreign\r\ncountries, in particular developing countries, between\r\n1979 and 1996. The nature of such illegal measures has\r\nchanged with the passage of time, and the adoption of\r\nmeasures with extraterritorial implications against the\r\ntrade and investment partners of targeted countries has\r\nfollowed that of unilateral measures. The response to\r\nthese policies and measures has also intensified at the\r\ninternational level. An increasing number of voices\r\nfrom multilateral forums, regional bodies and the\r\nprivate sector have joined those of the Member States\r\nand called for the total elimination and lifting of\r\nunilateral extraterritorial and other forms of coercive\r\neconomic measures.\r\nThe critical need for an equitable, rule-based,\r\nsecure, non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral\r\ntrading system has been invariably emphasized in\r\nalmost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on\r\nfinancial and commercial issues and in related financial\r\ndeclarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in\r\nthis system. The need for a favourable and conducive\r\ninternational economic and financial environment and a\r\npositive investment climate as a means to facilitate and\r\npromote the share of developing countries in\r\ninternational trade and finance has also been endorsed\r\nby Member States by consensus year after year.\r\nThese instruments have, inter alia, invariably\r\ncalled on all countries to abolish all measures which\r\ncould impede free international trade and financial\r\ntransactions. These coercive measures also adversely\r\naffect the enjoyment of human rights of those countries\r\nagainst which these measures are directed. As we all\r\nknow, the Commission on Human Rights has also\r\nrepeatedly reiterated that the application of unilateral\r\ncoercive measures has a negative impact on social and\r\nhuman development in the targeted developing\r\ncountries.\r\nBased on these principles and commitments, the\r\ninternational community, inclusive of both developed\r\nand developing countries, has presented a vigorous\r\nreaction to these illegal measures and actions. Many\r\ndeveloped countries have discussed these illegal\r\ninstruments within their own coordination frameworks\r\nand rejected their enactment. Some of them have even\r\nused international and intergovernmental mechanisms\r\nto pre-empt recourse to such measures.\r\nCollectively, developing countries have\r\nsystematically rejected recourse to such measures,\r\nincluding at the meetings of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity. The final outcome of the recent South\r\nSummit in Havana adopted a very clear stand in this\r\nregard. Moreover, individually, developing countries\r\nhave also promulgated legal acts aimed at countering\r\nthe legal effects of such measures within their national\r\nterritory.\r\nFinally, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA),\r\nas an obvious example of extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures, is against international law. It is an\r\nillegal instrument which has targeted the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial relations of other countries\r\nwith the Islamic Republic of Iran. This instrument is\r\nalso against the Declaration on Principles of\r\nInternational Law concerning Friendly Relations and\r\nCooperation among States in accordance with the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. This blunt instrument\r\nprevents any improvement in the atmosphere and\r\nimpedes attempts to remove misunderstanding and\r\nmistrust.\r\nThe General Assembly, in its resolution 53/10 of\r\n26 October 1998, expressed grave concern over the\r\nnegative impact of unilateral extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures and called for their immediate\r\nrepeal. It also called upon all States not to recognize\r\nthese coercive measures, to refrain from recourse to\r\nsuch measures and to nullify them if they are in place.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nMy delegation calls upon all Member States to\r\nunanimously adopt the draft resolution before us on the\r\nagenda item under consideration. The unanimous\r\nadoption of this draft resolution will represent the\r\ncollective will and commitment of the entire\r\nintergovernmental body to the principles, goals and\r\nobjectives enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations and other related agreed international\r\ninstruments.\r\nMr. Osio (Nigeria): I should like first of all to\r\nconvey to you, Sir, the warm greetings of my\r\nAmbassador, Chief Arthur Mbanefo, and his regret for\r\nhis inability to be present here personally because of\r\nother, more pressing engagements. Accordingly, I am\r\ndelivering this statement on his behalf.\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China in support of draft resolution\r\nA/55/L.9, entitled “Elimination of coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\ncompulsion”, which was introduced earlier by the\r\nAmbassador of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. In adding\r\nour support for the draft, I have the further honour of\r\nreiterating the position of the heads of State or\r\nGovernment of developing countries on this issue, as\r\ncontained in their Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction arising from the Group of 77 South Summit\r\nheld in April 2000 in Havana, Cuba. That Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action are contained in document\r\nA/55/74, dated 12 May 2000.\r\nI should like to quote parts of that Declaration.\r\nParagraph 4 of the Declaration states:\r\n“We reaffirm that in our endeavours we are\r\nguided by all the principles and purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and by full respect for the\r\nprinciples of international law.”\r\nParagraph 50 states:\r\n“We express grave concern over the impact\r\nof economic sanctions on the development\r\ncapacity in the targeted countries, in this context\r\nnoting that Libya has now fulfilled all its\r\nobligations in terms of pertinent Security Council\r\nresolutions, and we urge the Security Council to\r\nadopt a resolution completely lifting the sanctions\r\nagainst Libya. We also call for the immediate\r\nlifting of all unilateral sanctions imposed against\r\nLibya outside of the United Nations system.”\r\nThat declaration is very pertinent to the guidance\r\nof this Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994,\r\nI now call on the Observer for the International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMr. Gospodinov (International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): The general object\r\nof the International Federation of Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies, defined in article 2 of its\r\nconstitution, is to\r\n“inspire, encourage, facilitate, and promote\r\nat all times all forms of humanitarian activities by\r\nthe member Societies with a view to preventing\r\nand alleviating human suffering and thereby\r\ncontributing to the maintenance and the\r\npromotion of peace in the world.”\r\nThis is the starting point for the International\r\nFederation’s contribution to this debate. Any\r\nimposition of sanctions exposes a potential tension\r\nbetween two purposes: affecting the policies and\r\nbehaviour of a target Government and protecting the\r\nlife, health and dignity of the people of that country.\r\nSanctions are intended to deal with the former, but risk\r\nundermining the latter during the course of their\r\nimplementation.\r\nIt is the view of the International Federation that\r\nsanctions regimes can, and frequently do, intensify\r\nhuman suffering. This suffering is especially acute in\r\nits impact on the most vulnerable groups in society, in\r\nparticular,  children, people at lower socio-economic\r\nlevels, refugees and displaced persons.\r\nThe International Federation’s views on the\r\nimpact of sanctions is informed by the work done in\r\naffected countries by the national Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Societies, including the Societies in the\r\naffected countries, as well as the participating Red\r\nCross Societies from other countries that have worked\r\nwith them.\r\nIn 1997, the International Federation’s General\r\nAssembly adopted decision 52 on action on behalf of\r\nnational Societies working in countries in particularly\r\ndifficult situations, such as embargoes. The resolution\r\nnoted that sanctions often cause a deteriorating\r\nhumanitarian situation, in particular shortage of food\r\nand medicines. The decision followed resolution 4,\r\nadopted by the twenty-sixth International Conference\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nof the Red Cross and Red Crescent in 1995, which\r\ncalled on the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross, the International Federation and all national\r\nSocieties to contribute to the reduction of the\r\nundesirable side-effects of sanctions.\r\nThe International Conference is composed of all\r\n189 States parties to the Geneva Conventions and the\r\n176 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. It\r\nhas remained seized of the issue, and incorporated\r\nreference to it in the Plan of Action for the years 2000-\r\n2003 adopted at its twenty-seventh International\r\nConference. The Plan seeks, among other things, to\r\nensure that provision for the rights and needs of the\r\nmost vulnerable people is the first priority for\r\nhumanitarian action. Paragraph 10 of Chapter 2 of the\r\nPlan states:\r\n“States and the Movement encourage the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council, before applying\r\neconomic sanctions, to take into account the\r\nneeds of the civilian population and apply\r\nhumanitarian exemptions, as appropriate.”\r\nThe paragraph goes on to welcome the work then under\r\nway within the Security Council on the humanitarian\r\nimpact of sanctions.\r\nFor us and, we believe, for many other\r\nhumanitarian organizations, these are intensely\r\npractical issues related to our ability to support our\r\nmember national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\r\nand, with them, to assist vulnerable people affected by\r\nsanctions. That is why it is necessary to pay careful\r\nattention to the details of the actual workings of each\r\nsanctions regime. It is, for example, now accepted that\r\nadequate procedures have to be in place to provide the\r\nappropriate humanitarian exemptions whenever\r\nsanctions are imposed.\r\nThe International Federation and its national\r\nSocieties are also concerned that when sanctions\r\nregimes are implemented they can have a number of\r\ndamaging consequences for the fabric of the target\r\ncountry. Some of these consequences are directly\r\nharmful to the most vulnerable people in the country,\r\nand they can remain so for years after the sanctions\r\nthemselves have been lifted. These harmful effects\r\ninclude the dislocation of the economic and social\r\nstructure of the country, leading to long-term\r\nunemployment, social disorder and enduring hardship\r\nfor the most vulnerable.\r\nFinally, we urge States to take into account,\r\nbefore designing and imposing sanctions, the likely\r\nimpact on the civilian population both in the short and\r\nthe long term; to monitor these consequences as the\r\nbasis for modifications to the sanctions regime; and to\r\nsupport efforts to provide relief for the most vulnerable\r\ngroups in the target country by making resources\r\navailable, and by ensuring that the practicalities of\r\nexemptions for humanitarian purposes are designed to\r\nfacilitate, not hinder, these efforts.\r\nThe Acting President: Again, in accordance with\r\nthe decision taken earlier, I now call on the Observer of\r\nthe Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Martino (Holy See): My delegation\r\nis pleased to take this opportunity to participate in the\r\ndiscussion of agenda item 31, the “Elimination of\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political\r\nand economic compulsion”.\r\nThe Holy See has always voiced its concern for\r\ncooperation and solidarity among peoples of all lands.\r\nIn his great encyclical, Rerum Novarum, written in\r\n1891, Pope Leo XIII spoke of the necessity of\r\nunderstanding the common needs and aspirations that\r\nguide economic growth and the elimination of poverty.\r\nIn celebration of the hundredth anniversary of\r\nthat first social encyclical, Pope John Paul II wrote:\r\n“The poor ask for the right to share in\r\nenjoying material goods and to make good use of\r\ntheir capacity for work, thus creating a world that\r\nis more just and prosperous for all.”\r\nUnfortunately, the “right to share in enjoying\r\nmaterial goods” and the creation of “a world that is\r\nmore just and prosperous” have been, and continue to\r\nbe, challenged by the imposition of economic measures\r\nthat are not only coercive, but which also tend to stifle\r\nthe very spirit of cooperation leading towards\r\nsustainable economic and social development.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General provides the\r\nresponses of the 13 Governments that replied to his\r\nrequest to contribute to the report. My delegation\r\nrealizes that receiving only 13 responses might appear\r\ninsignificant; however, upon reading each statement\r\nprovided by these Governments, a truer picture\r\nemerges, and a number that might seem small speaks\r\nvolumes.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nThe Holy See has always opposed the use of\r\ncoercive economic measures, which are harmful to the\r\nsocial development of a nation and its people. On a\r\nnumber of occasions, especially in the recently\r\nconcluded special sessions of the General Assembly,\r\nthe Holy See has noted its concern with the effects of\r\nthese measures, not only upon the nations on which\r\nthey are imposed but also on those States that suffer the\r\nnegative effects of trade barriers which are part of\r\nthose measures.\r\nIn his address to the Jubilee of Workers, Pope\r\nJohn Paul II, reflecting on his understanding of the\r\nrewards that come from a recognition of the gift of\r\nhuman dignity, said,\r\n“Therefore the Jubilee Year calls for a\r\nrediscovery of the meaning and value of work. It\r\nis also an invitation to address the economic and\r\nsocial imbalances in the world of work by re-\r\nestablishing the right hierarchy of values, giving\r\npriority to the dignity of working men and women\r\nand to their freedom, responsibility and\r\nparticipation. It also spurs us to redress situations\r\nof injustice by safeguarding each people’s culture\r\nand different models of development.”\r\nMy delegation believes that those words and the\r\nsentiment they convey can easily be translated into our\r\ndiscussion today — that is, addressing economic and\r\nsocial imbalances and redressing situations of injustice.\r\nUpon reading the responses provided in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General, it is evident that opposition to\r\nthe use of coercive measures is widespread. That same\r\nopposition can be seen in the following paragraphs\r\nfrom resolutions adopted at the fifty-first and fifty-\r\nthird sessions, in which the General Assembly:\r\n“Recalling its numerous resolutions in\r\nwhich it has called upon the international\r\ncommunity to take urgent and effective steps to\r\nend coercive economic measures” (resolution\r\n51/22)\r\nand,\r\n“Expresses its deep concern at the negative\r\nimpact of unilaterally imposed extraterritorial\r\ncoercive economic measures on trade and\r\nfinancial and economic cooperation, including at\r\nthe regional level, as well as the serious obstacles\r\nposed to the freedom of trade and the free flow of\r\ncapital at the regional and international levels”\r\n(resolution 53/10, para. 3).\r\nMy delegation adds its voice to those replies\r\nreceived by the Secretary-General and to the Assembly\r\nresolutions which call for an end to the use of any\r\nmeasures that are coercive and that are incompatible\r\nwith international law and the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe many heads of State and Government who\r\ngathered in this very Hall only a few weeks ago\r\nreaffirmed their commitment to that same Charter. My\r\ndelegation hopes that the spirit of that Millennium\r\nAssembly will continue and help to bring an end to any\r\nmeasure that would hinder the social or economic\r\ndevelopment of any nation or its people.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. I should like to\r\ninform members that action on draft resolution\r\nA/55/L.9 will be taken at a later date.\r\nOne representative has requested to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members\r\nthat statements in the exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al-Awdi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation has listened to the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of Iraq in which he dealt with my\r\ncountry, Kuwait, and my Government in an\r\ninappropriate manner and in the wrong place.\r\nRegrettably, the representative of Iraq has arrogantly\r\nand selfishly tried to confuse the issue of the unilateral\r\nmeasures that we are talking about with the legal\r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council in\r\naccordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThe representative of Iraq always, and\r\ndeliberately, evokes these issues and confuses them,\r\nbelieving that the people sitting in this Hall are\r\nignorant and do not understand this issue. This is a\r\nmistake.\r\nAccording to my understanding and my reading\r\nof the draft resolution before us, it talks about\r\nunilateral, extraterritorial economic measures, and\r\ntherefore has nothing to do with the issue of sanctions\r\nin general, nor with sanctions imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nSanctions have been imposed against Iraq\r\nbecause Iraq violated the Charter of the United Nations\r\nby occupying Kuwait. We in Kuwait call upon our\r\nbrethren in Libya and Cuba to deny Iraq the\r\nopportunity to mix these two different issues and to\r\nexploit the issue of unilateral measures to justify Iraq’s\r\nviolation of Security Council resolutions, the principles\r\nof the Charter and of international law. We call upon\r\nthese countries to explain to everyone else that what\r\nLibya and Cuba are facing is different from what Iraq\r\nsaid today about the sanctions imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe representative of Iraq talked explicitly about\r\ninternational laws and the Charter. I would like to ask\r\nhim, what name does he give to Iraq’s actions in\r\nKuwait? Did Iraq not occupy Kuwait? A major, strong\r\ncountry like Iraq occupied a small country like Kuwait.\r\nHe referred more than once to international law. I\r\nwould like to ask him, what name does he give to\r\nIraq’s occupation of Kuwait? He calls for the\r\nimplementation of international law, but he has to\r\nrespect it before he invokes it.\r\nIraq is using the same old arrogant method. We\r\nheard the statement by the Ambassador of Libya, for\r\nwhom we have the greatest respect. However, I would\r\nlike to know, is Iraq using a different method? Iraq is\r\nexhibiting the same flagrant arrogance as the major\r\nPowers. It is the same method. Iraq is using its might to\r\nadvance its interests. When a small country like mine is\r\ninvolved, Iraq does not give a damn; it occupies it in\r\nviolation of international law and conventions.\r\nWhat Iraq did to my country — such as aerial\r\nbombardment — has nothing to do with the issue\r\nbefore us today. We completely reject the link he tried\r\nto make. We would like to emphasize that what the\r\nIraqi Ambassador talked about today concerns\r\nunilateral sanctions. The issue before the Assembly is\r\nnot legitimate sanctions imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil. The representative of the International\r\nFederation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent\r\nSocieties talked today about unilateral coercive\r\nmeasures and not legitimate sanctions. Legitimate\r\nsanctions, which are what the representative of Iraq has\r\ntalked about, were implemented in accordance with the\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy.\r\nWe reiterate that we will not be silent about this.\r\nIf Iraq raises this issue, we will reply. If the Iraqi\r\nAmbassador discusses Kuwait, I will respond. Iraq is\r\ntrying to scare us, to intimidate us, but we are not\r\nafraid. Before Iraq talks about the United Nations\r\nCharter and international law, it should respect them.\r\nWe call upon those in Cuba and Libya not to provide\r\nIraq with a means to justify its acts.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I regret\r\nhaving to take the floor at this late hour, but I am\r\nobliged to respond to the representative of the Kuwaiti\r\nregime, a puppet of the United States and talking on its\r\nbehalf. The representative of Kuwait wants to tell the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the representatives of the States\r\nin attendance what they should talk about, how, and\r\nwhat issues they should or should not deal with.\r\nThis podium is a free one. Countries have the\r\nright to express their viewpoints freely. It is true that\r\nthe United Nations Headquarters is in the United States\r\nof America, but, in accordance with the Headquarters\r\nAgreement, States have the right to exercise self-\r\nexpression freely from this rostrum — despite the fact\r\nthat it is located in a State that exerts all forms of\r\ncoercion against other peoples.\r\nAll the delegations here dealt with sanctions, be\r\nthey unilateral or multilateral. It is difficult to talk\r\nabout an item entitled “Elimination of coercive\r\neconomic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion” and ignore the multilateral\r\ncoercive measures that are being imposed.\r\nAs I said in my statement, many of these\r\nmultilateral measures are imposed coercively on\r\ninternational organizations because one hegemonist\r\nState wants this. In fact, they are unilateral coercive\r\nmeasures. The sanctions imposed against Iraq are an\r\nexample of that. At the moment all countries of the\r\nworld — except the United States and its agent\r\nKuwait — are opposed to the sanctions imposed\r\nagainst Iraq.\r\nOn the other hand, I referred to Kuwait in one\r\nword in my statement. I said that Kuwait provides land\r\nbases and facilities for American aircraft to bomb Iraqi\r\ncivilians daily. American aggression is in fact a\r\nunilateral use of force against Iraq, for which there is\r\nno legitimate excuse, legal basis or United Nations\r\nauthorization. According to the Charter of the United\r\nNations, this is then an act of aggression. Anyone who\r\nprovides facilities for those who commit acts of\r\naggression is actually an accomplice to such acts.\r\nKuwait and Saudi Arabia provide facilities, land bases\r\nand financing. They finance this aggression against\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.37\r\nIraq. This is a fact that the international community\r\nshould be aware of. Those who call for respect for\r\ninternational legitimacy and resolutions should abide\r\nby them first.\r\nThis has been going on for 10 years now, and it\r\ncontinues. They attack us every day and deny us the\r\nright to protest their aggression. Kuwait is a small State\r\nneighbouring Iraq with a population of about 600,000\r\npeople.\r\nTherefore I call on the representative of Kuwait\r\nto respect the rights of the representatives of other\r\nStates to express their views freely in this Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: May I remind delegations\r\nthat, in their second intervention in right of reply,\r\naccording to the rules of procedure, they are entitled to\r\nfive minutes.\r\nMr. Al-Awdi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I will\r\nnot respond at length to the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of the Iraqi regime. We have long been\r\nfamiliar with his accusations and lies, so I will not\r\naddress them in my reply.\r\nAs to what he said about the question of\r\naggression, we are a small State and do not undertake\r\naggression against anyone, to which our history bears\r\nwitness. It is his powerful country that behaves in that\r\nway. With respect to our relationship with the United\r\nStates, we have no fear. It is a friendly country to\r\nwhich we are bound by agreements. We are unafraid in\r\nthat regard.\r\nIraq is trying to divide the Arabs. We have\r\npromised to support Libya in its just cause so as to\r\npreserve Arab unity. The same is true of our Palestinian\r\nbrothers. However, there are instructions being sent\r\nfrom Israel to Iraq not to raise questions that may sow\r\ndiscord.\r\nIt seems to me that there is some confusion here\r\nas to who adheres to the Charter and who does not.\r\nWhich is the powerful and arrogant State and which is\r\nthe small and weak one? Everything that Iraq has said\r\nis false. I am preventing no one from addressing any\r\nagenda item, but I reserve the right to express my\r\nopinion.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I apologize\r\nfor asking to speak yet again, but I will be very brief. I\r\nshould like to respond to one particular point that has\r\njust been made.\r\nAnyone who speaks in this Hall should respect\r\nother speakers’ intelligence, as he should also respect\r\nfacts and reality. When the representative of Kuwait\r\nstates that his country is not an aggressor against any\r\nother State or entity, what should we say about the fact\r\nthat American and British aircraft take off daily from\r\nKuwaiti territory to bomb children in another State?\r\nPerhaps the representative of Kuwait feels that being\r\nallied with the United States allows him to tell lies and\r\nthat the international community will believe him.\r\nA second issue raised by the representative of\r\nKuwait concerned the relationship between Israel and\r\nIraq. He claimed that Iraq receives and carries out\r\ninstructions from Israel. I leave it to the intelligence of\r\nmembers to assess this accusation. It is obviously\r\nabsurd — as absurd as the person who uttered it.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\n"
