(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 170\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe\r\nDraft resolution (A/55/L.8)\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Italy to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/55/L.8.\r\nMr. Vento (Italy): As Permanent Representative\r\nof the State that is the current Chairman of the\r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I am\r\nhonoured to introduce a draft resolution on this new\r\nitem in the agenda of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Allow me to also take this\r\nopportunity to welcome the Secretary General of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, Mr. Walter Schwimmer, and the\r\ndelegation from the Councils Parliamentary Assembly\r\nthat is here to follow the work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThis item was inserted in the agenda in\r\naccordance with Recommendation 1411 of 21 June\r\n1999 of the Councils Parliamentary Assembly, which\r\nstressed the need to enhance cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations, in view of the contribution that the\r\nCouncil of Europe has made to the United Nations over\r\nthe past 50 years, particularly in promoting the rule of\r\nlaw and the protection of human rights and democratic\r\nvalues.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe started in 1951, just two years after\r\nthe Council was founded, with the signing of an\r\nagreement that was updated 20 years later, in 1971,\r\nthrough the Arrangement on Cooperation between the\r\nsecretariat of the Council of Europe and the United\r\nNations.\r\nAnother milestone was the adoption at the forty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly of a resolution\r\ngranting observer status to the Council of Europe.\r\nThe draft resolution that I am presenting today\r\ncites more recent examples of this cooperation, as\r\nfollows.\r\nAt the twenty-third special session of the General\r\nAssembly, entitled Women 2000, the Council of\r\nEurope contributed to the fight against trafficking in\r\nwomen and to the promotion of gender mainstreaming,\r\nwhile at the twenty-fourth special session, on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, the Council embraced the\r\nstrategy for social cohesion, focusing on the protection\r\nof social rights, access to housing, employment and\r\nsocial protection and family and children policies.\r\nThe Council has supported United Nations efforts\r\nto restore peace in Kosovo by establishing close\r\nworking relations with the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo and focusing on\r\nlegislative reforms in line with texts such as the\r\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nOn 11 to 13 October 2000, the Council organized\r\na successful pan-European Conference on racism and\r\nintolerance to prepare for the 2001 United Nations\r\nWorld Conference in South Africa.\r\nOther tasks lie ahead: the Council of Europe\r\nintends to contribute actively to the special session of\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly for the follow-up\r\nto the World Summit for Children, scheduled for\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\nIn his recent visit to the Parliamentary Assembly\r\nin Strasbourg, the President of the Italian Republic, Mr.\r\nCarlo Azeglio Ciampi, recalled the high ethical and\r\npolitical beliefs that inspired the founding of the\r\nCouncil of Europe. It embodied the faith of European\r\ncitizens in a system of shared values, enshrined in the\r\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights, whose fiftieth\r\nanniversary will be celebrated in Rome on 3 and 4\r\nNovember with a Ministerial Conference. Some of the\r\npillars of this ambitious legal system are the European\r\nSocial Charter, the European Convention for the\r\nPrevention of Torture and the Framework Convention\r\nfor the Protection of National Minorities. These\r\ninstruments, together with other conventions and\r\nrecommendations, have helped consolidate the\r\nprinciples of freedom and justice in Europe. Moreover,\r\nthe original vision of the Council of Europe helped\r\npave the way for the integration of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nThe borders of European civilization are not pre-\r\nestablished or strictly linked to geography. Rather, they\r\ndepend on the power of these values to be understood\r\nand shared throughout the world. The Council currently\r\nconsists of 41 States, representing more than 800\r\nmillion people, but others will soon join, giving the\r\norganization a pan-European dimension. The Holy See,\r\nthe United States of America, Canada, Japan and\r\nMexico are observer members. Within the organization,\r\nconsideration has begun on the possibility of granting a\r\nspecial cooperative status to countries interested in\r\nparticipating in its work, particularly in the field of\r\ndemocratization and modernization of the judiciary.\r\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out\r\nduring his recent visit to the Council of Europe in\r\nStrasbourg, amid the great transformation known as\r\nglobalization the world is still fighting intolerance,\r\nracism, xenophobia and desegregation  the very\r\ndangers targeted by the founders of the Council of\r\nEurope.\r\nThis is why we are convinced that closer\r\ncooperation with the United Nations can bear great\r\nresults. This is why we would like to consider the idea\r\nof creating a liaison office for the Council in New York\r\non a reciprocal basis.\r\nI wish to conclude by recalling that the Council\r\nof Europe, as the sole pan-European organization, is in\r\na position to make a substantial contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations in meeting its rising challenges. To\r\ngrapple with these challenges effectively will\r\nnecessitate a synergistic coordination of our efforts and\r\nresources.\r\nFor example, the Venice Commission, the\r\nCouncils authoritative advisory body on legal and\r\ninstitutional matters, which celebrated its tenth\r\nanniversary last June, has begun to elaborate a package\r\nof standard legal elements and constitutional proposals\r\ntowards finding a solution to the ethnic conflicts of\r\nmember States.\r\nMoreover, the interaction between culture and the\r\nenvironment is one of the main themes of a Ministerial\r\nConference taking place in Florence even as we speak.\r\nOn this occasion, an important new legal instrument,\r\nthe Landscape Convention, has been opened for\r\nsignature. The Convention contains highly innovative\r\ncontent and proposes to raise public awareness of\r\nquality-of-life issues.\r\nHowever, the most important concept inspiring\r\nthe actions of the Council of Europe, which I am\r\nconvinced that the United Nations also fully shares,\r\nconcerns democratic stability  entailing the\r\ninterdependence of human rights, democracy, good\r\ngovernance and the rule of law, as well as conflict\r\nprevention, peace-building and stability. For more\r\nthan five decades, the Council of Europe has been\r\ndeveloping significant expertise in these issues. It is\r\nthus now able to make an increasingly substantial\r\ncontribution to the prevention of conflict and, when\r\nunfortunately necessary, to  long-term post-conflict\r\npeace and institution-building. The Council of Europes\r\ncapabilities in conflict prevention lie in a combination\r\nof standard-setting, cooperation  both collectively\r\nbetween all member countries and bilaterally  and\r\nmonitoring, at the legal and political levels.\r\nAt this historic juncture, it would be timely for\r\nthe General Assembly to ask the Secretary-General to\r\nexplore ways and means of enhancing an already\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nadvanced cooperation in order to meet the challenges,\r\nold and new, of the third millennium.\r\nSince both the Council and the United Nations\r\nplace human dignity at the centre of their missions and\r\nmandates, stronger working links between them can\r\nonly aid in the achievement of their noble cause.\r\nMr. Bossière (France) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated\r\nwith the European Union: Bulgaria, Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia and the associated countries:\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey associate themselves with\r\nthis statement.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe has existed for a long time. It has\r\ndeveloped constantly over the years especially since\r\nthe agreement concluded in 1951 between the two\r\ninstitutions. In 1989, the observer status granted to the\r\nCouncil of Europe at the United Nations has enabled it\r\nto play an active role in areas of activity they have in\r\ncommon. This relates, first and foremost, to the\r\nprotection and promotion of human rights, but also to\r\nthe tireless quest for peace and international security.\r\nExperience has shown that these two areas of\r\nactivity are interdependent and that they reinforce each\r\nother. Security cannot be achieved without democracy\r\nand respect for human rights. This approach has been\r\ncalled, in the context of the Council of Europe, the\r\nquest for democratic stability.\r\nToday, we have reached a new stage. The draft\r\nresolution submitted to the General Assembly\r\nconstitutes a first in relations between the two\r\norganizations. It should, in the long run, strengthen the\r\ntwo major areas of cooperation: defending democracy,\r\nbased on the pre-eminence of the rule of law and\r\nrespect for human rights, but also, strengthening the\r\ncontribution of the Council of Europe to regional\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe defence of democracy based on the rule of\r\nlaw and respect for human rights is the first area of\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Council of Europe, thanks especially to the\r\nEuropean Convention for the Protection of Human\r\nRights and Fundamental Freedoms, has done\r\nexemplary work in the area of human rights. In\r\nparticular, it should be recalled that, with the creation\r\nof the European Court of Human Rights, the\r\nConvention established machinery, unique in Europe,\r\nfor jurisdictional control of the respect for all of these\r\nbasic rights by States parties.\r\nOn 3 and 4 November, a European Ministerial\r\nConference, to which the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights is invited, will take\r\nplace in Rome in order to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Convention.\r\nThe draft resolution before us quite rightly\r\nemphasizes the many challenges facing the United\r\nNations and which the Council of Europe also must\r\nface. By way of illustration we could refer to\r\ncooperation between the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and also that\r\nwhich exists between the International Law\r\nCommission of the United Nations and the Council of\r\nEurope, as well as the Councils contribution to the\r\npreparatory process for recent special sessions in two\r\nareas of major importance for human rights and social\r\nprogress, namely, Beijing Plus Five and Copenhagen\r\nPlus Five.\r\nThe European Union cannot fail to encourage the\r\nCouncil of Europe to maintain its active role, the one it\r\nhas thus far played, and invite it to continue to work\r\ntowards the realization of the commitments entered\r\ninto during those two Summits and the follow-up\r\nspecial sessions.\r\nThe European Union also welcomes the\r\ncontribution of the Council of Europe to the World\r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, which will be\r\nheld in 2001. In this connection, it welcomes the\r\nexcellent progress made and the results from the pan-\r\nEuropean Conference held in Strasbourg last week, in\r\npreparation for the 2001 World Conference.\r\nThrough these actions, the Council of Europe is\r\nconfirming its determination to play a key role in the\r\nimplementation in Europe of the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe contribution of the Council of Europe to\r\nregional security is the second area where the United\r\nNations could establish prospects for action.\r\nThe participation of the Council of Europe in\r\nregional security should, first and foremost, be judged\r\nby the facts. We can thus applaud its active\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\ncontribution to the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999) through its cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission in\r\nKosovo (UNMIK) and the establishment of an observer\r\nmission of the Council of Europe for the elections in\r\nKosovo on 28 October. Similarly we should cite\r\nSits handling of tasks entrusted to it by the General\r\nFramework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina for the protection of human rights and the\r\nreform of the judicial system.\r\nA third creditable contribution to regional\r\nsecurity is the assistance that the Council of Europe has\r\nprovided to the Stability Pact for South-Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\nThese actions are also part of the preventive\r\ndiplomacy that the United Nations tries to develop. In\r\nthe long run cooperation in this sphere could also foster\r\nand speed-up the difficult but necessary transition from\r\nan approach that is too often reactive in nature to\r\nactions that are based more on prevention. The\r\nEuropean Union is also in favour of developing\r\nrelations between the United Nations Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights of the Council of\r\nEurope.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to make three\r\nsuggestions aimed at further strengthening cooperation\r\nbetween the Council of Europe and the United Nations.\r\nThere should be an increase in the exchange of\r\ninformation. The United Nations and the Council of\r\nEurope have a mutual interest in a greater and more\r\nfrequent exchange of their reports and documents.\r\nBilateral relations between the two bodies should\r\nbe strengthened at the highest level. In a symbolic\r\nmanner, the holding of annual meetings between the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the\r\nSecretary General of the Council of Europe would\r\nconfirm the determination of both sides to have\r\nincreased cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nThe expertise of the two bodies should be\r\nenhanced. The establishment by the Council of Europe\r\nof a think tank to deal with issues of common interest\r\nto the United Nations and the Council, from which the\r\nUnited Nations could draw on technical skills and\r\nknow-how, could also contribute to further enhancing\r\nworking relations between the two organizations.\r\nFrom now on it will be for the General Assembly,\r\nas part of its annual consideration of the draft\r\nresolution on this item, to follow up this task of\r\nreflection and ingenuity in order that the contribution\r\nof the Council of Europe to the promotion of human\r\nrights and regional security may usefully support the\r\nwork of the United Nations throughout the world.\r\nMr. imonović (Croatia): My delegation very\r\nmuch welcomes the initiative to give the issue of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe its rightful place as a specific item\r\non the agenda of the General Assembly. We especially\r\nappreciate the efforts of the Italian Government in\r\nrealizing this.\r\nIn striving towards our vision of a United Nations\r\nfor the twenty-first century, strengthening relationships\r\nand increasing cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations is intrinsic to the\r\nachievement of their ultimate common goals.\r\nOrganizations such as the Council of Europe  which\r\nhave an important role to play in promoting democracy,\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law  can, without\r\nimposing any of their views and values,\r\ncomprehensively furnish the United Nations with long-\r\nterm pan-European experiences, thus contributing to,\r\nand further enhancing, the United Nations in its work\r\nto resolve some of the most pressing global challenges\r\nbefore us.\r\nThe Council of Europe remains the leading\r\nregional organization in the field of the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights, in both standard-setting and\r\nin the implementation dimension. It should be noted\r\nthat the European Convention on Human Rights was\r\nadopted in 1950 as the first legally binding instrument\r\ndevoted to the protection of a wide range of civil and\r\npolitical rights. As cited in its preamble, the\r\nConvention was clearly inspired by the provisions of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, thereby\r\nacknowledging even then an important link between\r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe system.\r\nHere at the United Nations the Council of Europe\r\nenjoys observer status, with links between the two\r\norganizations well established. However, this is the\r\nfirst time that the General Assembly has discussed\r\ncooperation between the two, and it is our hope that it\r\nwill result in the establishment of stronger cooperation\r\nand specific joint programmes.\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nDuring recent years, cooperation has slowly\r\nbegun to increase within the framework of enhanced\r\nUnited Nations cooperation with regional\r\norganizations. The practice of convening meetings\r\nbetween the United Nations Secretary-General and the\r\nheads of regional organizations, including the\r\nforthcoming fourth meeting on the theme of\r\ncooperation for peace-building, is welcome. However,\r\nwe feel that they should be more frequent and be\r\nfollowed-up by meetings between the heads of specific\r\nprogrammes and officials of the respective\r\norganizations. The practice of the tripartite high-level\r\nmeetings between the United Nations, the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and\r\nthe Council of Europe is a prime example of where\r\ncooperation and coordination of activities in areas of\r\ncommon concern is already functioning.\r\nIn discussing current cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe, we should\r\nmention the close cooperation established under the\r\nframework of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), where,\r\nupon the invitation of the United Nations, the Council\r\nof Europe seconded its experts, who are working in the\r\narea of judicial reform, local and regional democracy,\r\nproperty rights and on a population census.\r\nI turn to Croatias own experience. During the\r\nprocess of the peaceful reintegration of Eastern\r\nSlavonia, which was at the time governed by the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern\r\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), in\r\nthe context of a United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperation, the Croatian Government witnessed the\r\nestablishment of excellent cooperation between\r\nUNTAES and the Council of Europe in the field of\r\ndeveloping education curriculums for minorities. Such\r\ncooperation and, more important, its results were\r\nhighly praised by the international community at large.\r\nWith regard to our neighbour Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the Republic of Croatia welcomes the\r\nreadiness of the Council of Europe to continue to fulfil\r\nthe role assigned to it in that country under the Dayton\r\nPeace Agreement. The Republic of Croatia believes\r\nthat membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the\r\nCouncil of Europe would have a very positive impact\r\non further democratic development and the protection\r\nof human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe cooperation between the two organizations\r\ncould be enhanced in a number of ways, including a\r\nbetter flow of information and the availability of\r\nrelevant documents at meetings convened by both\r\norganizations. With its expertise in the field of the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights and legal\r\nreforms, including the very important area of local and\r\nregional democracy, which has no counterpart in the\r\nactivities of the United Nations system, the Council of\r\nEurope could significantly contribute to the activities\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nOne of the key issues in rethinking the role of\r\nregional organizations in the changing world remains\r\nthe timely division of activities between the United\r\nNations as the universal Organization, on the one hand,\r\nand relevant regional organizations, on the other. With\r\nthis aim in mind, a streamlining of activities is needed\r\nin order to make better use of available resources and\r\navoid unnecessary duplication of activities. With\r\nregard to relations between the Council of Europe and\r\nthe United Nations, such duplication may occur with\r\nrespect to human rights monitoring mechanisms.\r\nDespite human rights monitoring mechanisms\r\nremaining a main goal of both organizations, without\r\ndue comparison of achieved results duplication of\r\nmonitoring may simply result in significantly divergent\r\nreports on the same human rights situation.\r\nAs a member of the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations, Croatia has actively contributed to the\r\nwork of both organizations. In recent years Croatia has\r\nbeen the subject of human rights monitoring\r\nmechanisms operated by both, thereby having\r\nexperienced in practice some of the predicaments I\r\nhave just mentioned. More specifically, in 1992\r\nmonitoring by the Special Rapporteur of the United\r\nNations Commission on Human Rights was\r\nestablished, and subsequent to the membership of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia in the Council of Europe, in 1996,\r\nCouncil of Europe monitoring was established,\r\ncovering both human rights and democratic\r\ndevelopments. Recently, the Parliamentary Assembly\r\ndecided to end the monitoring procedure, welcoming\r\nCroatias significant progress towards honouring its\r\ncommitments and obligations as a member State since\r\nits accession in 1996, and in particular since the\r\nparliamentary and presidential elections held earlier\r\nthis year.\r\nIn the light of the circumstances, the Republic of\r\nCroatia expects that these achievements and the\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\ncontinuing progress on its part should act as a pertinent\r\nbenchmark to be adequately and appropriately reflected\r\nin the report of the Special Rapporteur of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights on the situation of\r\nhuman rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic\r\nof Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro).\r\nCroatia fully supports the strengthening of\r\ncooperation between the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations, being aware that that regional\r\norganization, with its specific characteristics, can\r\nsignificantly contribute to the work of the United\r\nNations. The Council of Europes expertise in the\r\ndevelopment of human rights standards, in particular\r\nthrough the case law of the European Court of Human\r\nRights, should undoubtedly be reflected in the work of\r\nthe relevant United Nations bodies. The same is true\r\nwith respect to the achievements of the Council of\r\nEurope in standard-setting in the field of local and\r\nregional democracy, something which has yet to be\r\nachieved within the United Nations system.\r\nLast but not least, the parliamentary dimension of\r\nthe work of the Council of Europe should not be\r\nneglected, and could possibly provide guidance for\r\nfuture developments within the universal family of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Within\r\nthe framework of diversifying its foreign policy,\r\nMexico has strengthened and deepened its bilateral,\r\ninter-regional and multilateral relations with Europe\r\nand with European institutions in the political and\r\neconomic spheres and in terms of cooperation. In\r\nDecember 1999, Mexico became an observer at the\r\nCouncil of Europe; this has led to fruitful dialogue with\r\nthe Councils 41 member States and to active\r\nparticipation in all areas of common interest. My\r\ncountry attaches great importance to the work of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, which was reflected in my\r\nGovernments decision to establish a permanent\r\nrepresentation office in Strasbourg to follow the\r\nCouncils deliberations and decisions.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe has contributed to the success of the\r\nOrganizations missions and programmes in Europe.\r\nThanks to its genuinely pan-European nature, the\r\nCouncil has been a significant factor in the quest for\r\npeace and security and in promoting the values,\r\npurposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter\r\non the European continent. My delegation is convinced\r\nthat strengthening that cooperation will yield real\r\nbenefits for both organizations, and we hope that the\r\nAssembly will adopt draft resolution A/55/L.8, of\r\nwhich Mexico is pleased to be a sponsor, without a\r\nvote.\r\nMr. Bergqvist (Sweden): Let me stress first of all\r\nthat I entirely associate myself with the message\r\ndelivered by the presidency of the European Union.\r\nThe Council of Europe was created half a century\r\nago as a peace project. After two devastating world\r\nwars, the organization was set up to promote\r\nreconciliation and peaceful cooperation among\r\ndemocratic States. After the fall of the Berlin wall, the\r\nCouncil of Europe was faced with new important\r\nchallenges. As we know, its membership has nearly\r\ndoubled over the past decade; today, more than one\r\nfifth of the States Members of the United Nations are also\r\nactive members of the Council of Europe.\r\nThe inclusion of the new democracies of Central\r\nand Eastern Europe was considered to be a major factor\r\nin promoting peace and preventing conflict in Europe.\r\nSecurity is built on common values. The founders of\r\nthe Council of Europe wanted to share a peaceful\r\nfuture based on common values: democracy, the rule of\r\nlaw and respect for human rights and human dignity.\r\nIndeed, with great relief, we have seen examples of\r\nyesterdays enemies becoming todays partners in\r\nbuilding a better tomorrow.\r\nThe reasons why the Council of Europe places so\r\nmuch emphasis on democracy and human rights are\r\nclear enough. Lack of democratic processes and non-\r\nobservance of human rights often lead to alienation and\r\nviolent conflict. Instead, security should be based on\r\ninstitution-building, participation and dialogue. There\r\ncan be no sustainable solutions to violent conflicts\r\nwithout democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\r\nThe Council of Europe is now also developing its\r\nactivities in the field. I shall give just a few examples.\r\nIn the framework of the Stability Pact for South-\r\nEastern Europe, the Council of Europe leads activities\r\non issues such as creating ombudsman institutions,\r\npromoting inter-ethnic reconciliation, and gender\r\nissues. In Chechnya, the Council of Europe provides\r\nthree experts to the office of the Ombudsman to assist\r\nhim in his work to investigate human rights abuses.\r\nThe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture\r\nand Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\npays visits to prisons and other institutions in\r\nindividual member States, and reports on its findings.\r\nWhen developing activities in the field, we\r\nshould place particular emphasis on cooperation among\r\ninternational organizations. That is why Sweden\r\nwelcomes the draft resolution (A/55/L.8) before the\r\nAssembly on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Council of Europe. Such cooperation could be\r\nenhanced through extensive use of regular contacts,\r\nincluding meetings; a continuous framework for\r\ndialogue; increased transparency; and practical\r\ncooperation, including the appointment of liaison\r\nofficers and points of contact, cross-representation at\r\nappropriate meetings and other contacts intended to\r\nincrease understanding of each organizations tools and\r\nmethods.\r\nStronger bonds are good both for the United\r\nNations and for the Council of Europe, and not only\r\nbecause we can achieve less duplication and a more\r\nefficient use of resources. We can also strengthen the\r\nsupport for our common values and achieve better\r\nprotection for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nCivilian crisis management and conflict\r\nprevention are areas now under rapid development in\r\nvarious international organizations. That makes\r\ncooperation essential. It is gratifying to note that the\r\nBrahimi report puts emphasis on the need to make\r\npeacekeepers and peace-builders inseparable partners.\r\nAs stated in the Brahimi report, peace-building\r\nmissions should include international judicial experts,\r\npenal experts and human rights specialists in sufficient\r\nnumbers to strengthen rule of law institutions. The\r\nreport also notes that long-term preventive strategies\r\nmust work to promote human rights, to protect\r\nminority rights and to institute political arrangements\r\nin which all groups are represented. These are areas in\r\nwhich the Council of Europe possesses a special\r\nexpertise and in which cooperation should be of great\r\nvalue to both organizations, and indeed of great value\r\nto our peoples. Let us therefore work together in order\r\nto prevent future violent conflict.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein): It gives me\r\nparticular pleasure to address this item on our agenda,\r\nsince the Council of Europe is the oldest political\r\norganization in Europe and one whose high standards\r\nand principles concerning the rule of law, human rights\r\nand democratic institutions are exemplary.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, a strengthening and\r\nfurther enhancement of the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe is long\r\noverdue. Although the relationship between the two\r\norganizations dates back to 1951, when a cooperation\r\nagreement was concluded, the aim then was much less\r\nambitious than it is today. Fundamental changes and\r\ndevelopments have taken place since that time. The\r\nmembership of the United Nations has increased and its\r\noriginal mandates have expanded, and similar\r\ndevelopments have occurred with respect to the\r\nmembership of other organizations, including the\r\nCouncil of Europe.\r\nThere are a number of areas in which the Council\r\nof Europe can reinforce the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations and in which Member States can\r\nprofit from the Council of Europes experience, in\r\nparticular in the fields of post-conflict peace-building,\r\nconfidence-building measures, human rights, social\r\ndevelopment, the fight against racism, and crime\r\nprevention.\r\nThe Council of Europe has played, and continues\r\nto play, an important role in promoting a stable and\r\ndemocratic south-eastern Europe. The cooperation\r\nbetween the Council of Europe and the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)\r\nin the implementation of Security Council resolution\r\n1244 (1999) is a good example of concrete interaction\r\nin operational activities, in this particular case in the\r\nareas of the judiciary, the protection of minorities,\r\nproperty rights, registration and local democracy, as\r\nwell as the observation of the electoral process in\r\nKosovo. In the same region, namely in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the Council of Europe is engaged in the\r\nfield of judicial reform and that of the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights, and it is making a major\r\ncontribution to the Stability Pact for South-Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\nThe Council of Europe has been, and will\r\ncontinue to be, actively involved in past and future\r\nUnited Nations conferences and special sessions and\r\ntheir respective preparatory processes. The latest\r\nexamples are the special sessions on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development and Beijing + 5. The European\r\npreparatory process for the World Conference against\r\nRacism and Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance, which will take place next\r\nsummer, is being conducted by the Council of Europe,\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nand we note with satisfaction the results of the Pan-\r\nEuropean Conference which was held in Strasbourg\r\nlast week.\r\nIn this respect, we wish to pay tribute to the work\r\nof the European Commission against Racism and\r\nIntolerance (ECRI), which was established in 1993\r\nfollowing the first summit meeting of heads of State\r\nand Government of Council of Europe member States.\r\nThe Commission is composed of public figures chosen\r\nfor their high moral authority and recognized expertise\r\nin dealing with questions of racism and intolerance.\r\nThey include judges, parliamentarians, journalists and\r\npsychologists. Along with its examination of\r\ninternational and national legislation, the Commission\r\nhas studied policies and practices and has addressed\r\nspecific issues as well. The success of the European\r\nCommission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI)\r\ncan be attributed to its activities on raising awareness,\r\ndisseminating information and cooperating with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the\r\npresence of the Secretary General of the Council of\r\nEurope, Mr. Walter Schwimmer, as well as that of\r\nmembers of the Political Affairs Committee and of the\r\nSub-Committee on Relations with Non-Member\r\nCountries of the Parliamentary Assembly. Their\r\npresence underlines the commitment of the Council of\r\nEurope to build a closer relationship with the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe draft resolution before us contains all the\r\nnecessary elements which form the basis for increased\r\ncooperation between the two organizations.\r\nLiechtenstein will actively support all endeavours\r\nleading to the realization of this aim.\r\nMr. Filippi Balestra (San Marino): The Republic\r\nof San Marino welcomes the inclusion of the item\r\nentitled Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Council of Europe on the agenda of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are extremely\r\nthankful to the delegation of Italy, which promoted and\r\nsponsored this remarkable initiative.\r\nSan Marino co-sponsored the draft resolution on\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe because it is convinced that\r\ncooperation among States and regional organizations is\r\nan integral part of the concept of peace. It is now clear\r\nthat the efforts made by the Secretary-General, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council to\r\nmaintain peace, to ensure respect of human rights and\r\nthe rule of law and to apply the values of democracy\r\nare ineffective without the cooperation and support of\r\nother entities acting in the international arena,\r\nprimarily regional organizations.\r\nThe United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nare two complementary organizations and should\r\ntherefore be linked by an intensive cooperation with a\r\nview to reaching their common goals, while avoiding,\r\nwhenever possible, duplication and overlap in those\r\nareas in which both organizations have their own\r\nrespective and specific roles to play.\r\nForty-one member States, from every European\r\nregion, now form the Council of Europe. For this\r\nreason, and because of its particular institutional\r\nstructure, the Council is a unique forum for discussion\r\non issues of regional and global interest. The effective\r\naction of the Council of Europe in the field of human\r\nrights, for instance, is evident from the activities of the\r\nEuropean Court for Human Rights. This judicial organ\r\nhas, in fact, led many States to reconsider practices that\r\ncould have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of\r\nhuman rights by their own citizens.\r\nWe have witnessed some examples of the\r\ncooperation between these two organizations and the\r\nimportant results that it has brought about, especially in\r\nthe fields of human rights, humanitarian activities,\r\nassistance to refugees, legal and social issues and\r\nculture and education. My delegation deeply\r\nappreciated the contribution made by the Council of\r\nEurope through its participation in many activities of\r\nthe United Nations, inter alia, the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on women, Women 2000, and the\r\nspecial session on the implementation of the outcome\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development, as well\r\nas its constant presence at the regular meetings of the\r\nThird Committee of the General Assembly.\r\nI would like in particular to stress the role played\r\nby the Council of Europe in the crisis in Kosovo in\r\nsupporting United Nations efforts in the search for a\r\npeaceful settlement and its eagerness to offer its\r\ncooperation, in its fields of competence, to political\r\nand institutional reconstruction. We are also grateful to\r\nthe Council of Europe for the coordination of the\r\nEuropean Conference on Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and related Intolerance to\r\nwhich the United Nations was invited.\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nBy resolution 44/6, the General Assembly granted\r\nobserver status to the Council of Europe. We therefore\r\nstrongly support a more effective presence in New\r\nYork and the more active involvement of the Council\r\nof Europe in the work of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Council of Europe is now in a position to\r\nincrease its already substantial contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations. It may contribute effectively to\r\nincreasing democratic stability and building pluralistic\r\ndemocracies, as well as in many other fields where its\r\nexpertise is well recognized. It may also be an\r\nimportant vehicle to spread the principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations in Europe and in other\r\nregions of the world. We very much hope the\r\nSecretary-General will continue to explore, in close\r\nconsultation with the Council of Europe, different\r\npossibilities to further enhance the cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco) (spoke in French): I am\r\ngrateful to you, Mr. President, for allowing the\r\nrepresentative of a European State Member of the\r\nUnited Nations that is not yet a member of the Council\r\nof Europe  although we are fervently aspiring to\r\nbecome one  to speak on the agenda item on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and that lofty\r\nand respected European institution.\r\nThe Council of Europe has given the continent a\r\nsoul. Its ethical and normative work, which is rich and\r\neclectic in nature, has greatly contributed to making\r\nthat institution a moral reference point, not only for\r\nEurope, but without doubt at the global level.\r\nIts continent-specific mission can in no way be\r\nregarded as an obstacle to cooperation between the two\r\norganizations. The common values and principles that\r\ninspire them and that are to be found inscribed in\r\ngolden letters at the very heart of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as in the Statute of the Council\r\nof Europe, the European Convention on Human Rights\r\nand the European Social Charter, are universal in\r\nnature. They can be promoted without difficulty\r\nthrough actions designed and implemented in concert.\r\nWhether we are speaking about the promotion of\r\nhuman rights and civic freedoms, the strengthening of\r\nrepresentative democracy or the protection of\r\nminorities, the concerns of the two organizations\r\nconverge. That is an essential bond that is very\r\nfavourable to joint undertakings.\r\nThat great and very worthy institution  with its\r\nheadquarters in Strasbourg, at the very heart of a region\r\nlong battered and bruised  is unquestionably a\r\nsymbolic example of the precious contribution that\r\nregional cooperation can make in the world if it is\r\nbased on respect for shared principles and values.\r\nCooperation between the Council of Europe and\r\nthe United Nations, as well as its specialized agencies,\r\nstems from the same moral reference point and from\r\nidentical ethical commitments. For example, we note\r\nwith satisfaction, from document A/55/191, that the\r\nCouncil of Europe has concluded agreements with a\r\nnumber of agencies of the United Nations system, such\r\nas the United Nations Childrens Fund, the World\r\nHealth Organization and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,\r\nwhose activities are greatly appreciated by the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, which regularly contributes to\r\nthem. The many conventions and legal instruments,\r\nwhich are essentially profoundly ethical in nature,\r\ndeveloped within the Council of Europe are also, we\r\nare pleased to say, a specific and useful manifestation\r\nof this commitment.\r\nThis issue provides the delegation of Monaco\r\nwith the opportunity to express the admiration of my\r\ncountry for the work that has been done for more than\r\nhalf a century in the Council of Europe which, after the\r\nend of the Second World War, greatly helped to restore\r\ndignity, strength and traditional values to the European\r\ncontinent. These values are shared by the people of\r\nMonaco. They have been their values for centuries,\r\nsince the first lord of Monaco  whose dynasty\r\nextended back to 8 January 1297  set up in 1331 a\r\ngeneral assembly of inhabitants, called at the time the\r\nUniversity, which had jurisdiction over all public\r\naffairs.\r\nThis community of inhabitants, which brought\r\ntogether all the heads of family, without exception,\r\nrapidly became a parliament, presided over by the lord\r\nor his representative, the podesta. For centuries this\r\nparliament, working in complete freedom, dealt with\r\nall the problems of daily life that the population might\r\nencounter. Its jurisdiction was extremely broad,\r\ncovering the police, road maintenance, the organization\r\nof schools and poor relief. The people of Monaco were\r\nnot subject to any levies on their property or on their\r\nuse of communal ovens or mills, after the pattern of the\r\nfreedoms practised in the Republic of Genoa, whence\r\nmost of the people of Monaco originated.\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nMore recently, in 1910, after the first\r\nconstitutional phase  that of the Charter of Rights\r\nand Freedoms, granted in 1848  universal suffrage,\r\nwith the right to vote extended to women, was\r\nestablished for the elections to the Communal Council.\r\nOn 5 January 1911, the Principality of Monaco set up a\r\nmodern-style constitution that provided for two\r\ndemocratic assemblies: the Communal Council and the\r\nNational Council. These were kept under the\r\nconstitution that was adopted on 17 December 1962\r\nand which is now in force. That basic text, which, in its\r\nthird chapter  not in the preamble  provides for\r\nfundamental freedoms and rights, thus attests to the\r\npolitical will to give such rights an effective and\r\nlegally binding scope.\r\nThirty-two articles are devoted to this and\r\nguarantee, inter alia, political rights, the equality of\r\ncitizens before the law, the security of the individual,\r\nthe non-retroactive application of criminal law, the\r\nabolition of capital punishment, the inviolability of\r\ndomicile and property, respect for private and family\r\nlife, freedom of worship and freedom of expression. It\r\nalso grants the people of Monaco freedom of\r\nemployment and provides State assistance for the poor,\r\nthe unemployed, the sick, invalids and the elderly and\r\nprovides maternity benefits and free primary and\r\nsecondary education, as well as allowing union activity\r\nand recognizing the right of assembly and association\r\nand the right to petition public authorities.\r\nWhether we are dealing with individual civil and\r\npolitical rights or collective economic, social and\r\ncultural rights, or obligations of the State with respect\r\nto ends or means, all these constitutional provisions\r\ngive nationals of my country, as well as foreigners, as\r\nprescribed by Article 32 of the Constitution, the\r\neffective enjoyment, with judicial safeguards, of all the\r\npublic freedoms recognized and articulated in the\r\nconstitutions of modern democracies.\r\nThe guarantee of these rights is further\r\nstrengthened by the scrupulously respected\r\nfundamental constitutional principle of the separation\r\nof administrative, legislative and judicial powers and\r\nthe functions stemming therefrom.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco is a State in which\r\nthe rule of law prevails. The powers of the various\r\nauthorities, as well as the acts of individuals, are\r\nlimited, only by the law, which finds its formal points\r\nof reference in the Constitution, along with the\r\nremedies it has prescribed for use in the courts, which\r\nenable private persons to secure the repeal of public\r\nacts that are contrary to the law, and also reparation for\r\ndamage suffered.\r\nThis brief “pro domo” account is intended to\r\nremind you that the Monegasque nation for almost\r\nseven centuries now has enjoyed a liberal, democratic\r\nand enlightened system of government, attentive to the\r\ninterests and needs of the people and the various\r\ngenerations that have succeeded one another over time\r\nin this modest territory.\r\nDemocracy, first of all direct, then representative,\r\nwhich has been a feature of Monacos entire history,\r\nhas enabled the Monegasque people to share in debate;\r\nit has given them a taste for ideas, for dialogue and for\r\nrespect for what is in the general interest, which can be\r\nseen today, very vibrant and alive in Monegasque\r\nsociety. It is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the\r\nharmonious human relations that prevail among the\r\nvarious communities in my country, as well as for its\r\nbalanced economic and social development.\r\nThe delegation of the Principality of Monaco\r\nrightly appreciates the draft resolution that has just\r\nbeen introduced so brilliantly by His Excellency Mr.\r\nSergio Vento, the Ambassador and Permanent\r\nRepresentative of a country which itself is a historical\r\ncradle of our democracies, Italy. We wish to thank him\r\nvery sincerely for this initiative and to assure him of\r\nthe full support that we will give this draft. Today we\r\nwish to become a co-sponsor of the draft resolution,\r\nwhich correctly draws attention to the importance and\r\nquality of the cooperation that has been ongoing for a\r\nnumber of years now between the Council of Europe\r\nand United Nations institutions as a whole. It also\r\nhighlights the need to continue and expand that\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco is perfectly ready to\r\ncontribute further to this activity, both within the\r\nUnited Nations framework and in that of the Council of\r\nEurope. The concerted activities carried out in the\r\nparliamentary area and in the economic and social\r\nspheres, in education and research, as well as culture\r\nand communications, are given careful attention by the\r\nMonegasque authorities.\r\nThe constant struggle to protect human rights and\r\nfreedoms, the application of humanitarian law,\r\nassistance to refugees and to victims of torture, abuse\r\nand discrimination is a struggle that we share.\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nThe Principality of Monaco has actively\r\nparticipated, as has the Council of Europe, with its\r\ncommitment to these issues, in these special sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly devoted to women in the year\r\n2000 and to social development. It is also preparing to\r\nparticipate very energetically, with a view to achieving\r\nreal concrete results, in the World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance, which will take place in August\r\nand September of 2001 in South Africa, and to which I\r\nam certain the Council of Europe will make a major\r\ncontribution.\r\nLastly, we should note the major role in conflict\r\nprevention, and long-term peace-building that is\r\nincreasingly being played by regional organizations in\r\nparallel with the United Nations. In this respect, the\r\nCouncil of Europe can offer its unique experience in\r\nthe establishment of the rule of law, safeguards for\r\nsocial peace and international security, based on\r\ndemocratic rule and the protection of human rights. Its\r\nactivities and recommendations in this area are of\r\nincalculable value. We should never hesitate to have\r\nrecourse to its expertise.\r\nOur very ancient liberal democratic tradition,\r\nwhich I have just described, has pervaded countless\r\ngenerations of the citizens of Monaco. It now permits\r\nthem, alongside their Sovereign and their Government,\r\nto feel total concern for the ills and misfortunes of\r\npeoples, not only in Europe but throughout the world,\r\naffected by dictatorship, lack of freedom, violence in\r\nall its forms, poverty and under-development.\r\nIn conclusion, we welcome the presence of Mr.\r\nWalter Schwimmer, the Secretary General of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, whose skill and dedication are very\r\nwidely respected, and I take pleasure in confirming that\r\nthe Government of Monaco, with the greatest possible\r\nconviction, encourages further cooperation between the\r\ntwo institutions and the unreserved strengthening of\r\nthat cooperation.\r\nMr. Bojer (Denmark): I take great pleasure in\r\ntaking the floor on todays item entitled Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of\r\nEurope. I am especially pleased to be speaking here in\r\nthe presence of the Secretary General of the Council of\r\nEurope and of members of parliaments involved in the\r\nwork of both the United Nations and the Council of\r\nEurope. In this connection, let me recall that at the\r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National\r\nParliaments, held in August this year here in this\r\nAssembly, the Speaker of the Danish Folketing\r\nadvocated strengthening the parliamentary dimension\r\nin relation to the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations.\r\nDenmark was a founding member of the United\r\nNations in 1945. And in 1949, only four years later,\r\nDenmark joined forces with eight other European\r\ncountries to establish the Council of Europe. Since\r\nthen, Denmark has considered its membership of both\r\norganizations to be not only a privilege but indeed an\r\nobligation.\r\nThe Council of Europe, like the United Nations,\r\ncame into being as a result of those forceful words:\r\nNever again. Never again should our States suffer from\r\nthe scourge of war. Never again should the peoples of\r\nthe world see their human rights repressed, violated\r\nand obliterated. Never again should we experience the\r\natrocities of the Second World War. This is the\r\nobligation of our membership, and it is the very thrust\r\nof both organizations. There is, in fact, an inextricable\r\ninterrelationship  sometimes subtle, but always\r\ninextricable  between respect for human rights and\r\npreservation of peace.\r\nOn their own merits, and within their respective\r\nmandates, both organizations have important roles to\r\nplay with respect to peace and security. Both\r\norganizations are building on norms of good conduct\r\nand strengthening and monitoring commitments to\r\nconform to these norms.\r\nIn the early years, the Council of Europe and its\r\nmember States looked to the United Nations for\r\ninspiration and advice. The European Convention on\r\nHuman Rights, the main convention of the Council of\r\nEurope, is directly inspired by the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\r\nToday the United Nations can look to the Council\r\nof Europe for assistance and support to approach the\r\nchallenges it faces. The Council of Europe is in a\r\nposition to contribute substantially to the prevention of\r\nconflicts  one of the major challenges facing the\r\nUnited Nations  through its legal framework for the\r\nprotection of human rights and its mechanism for\r\nmonitoring the obligations and commitments stemming\r\nfrom membership of the organization. These, in fact,\r\nare essential tools of preventive diplomacy of the kind\r\nso often advocated by the Secretary-General when he\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nemphasises the crucial dimension of conflict\r\nprevention in peace-building.\r\nThe draft resolution duly acknowledges that the\r\nCouncil of Europe is promoting the prevention of\r\nconflict and long-term post-conflict peace-building\r\nthrough political and institutional reform. Indeed, it\r\nstresses that the standards and principles of the Council\r\nof Europe contribute to the solution of conflicts\r\nthroughout Europe.\r\nWe have already experienced the commitment of\r\nthe Council of Europe to cooperate with the United\r\nNations in the special sessions of the General\r\nAssembly following up the world conferences in\r\nBeijing and Copenhagen. And we are experiencing it in\r\nthe preparations for the World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance. In Kosovo, the Council of Europe\r\nwill provide assistance in the upcoming elections.\r\nThese are just a few examples. Others are also\r\nmentioned in the draft resolution, and more will\r\nmaterialize as cooperation broadens and deepens.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit the worlds heads\r\nof State and Government took stock of the challenges\r\nthat face the United Nations at the beginning of the\r\nnew millennium. They resolved\r\nTo strengthen the capacity of all our countries to\r\nimplement the principles and practices of\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights,\r\nincluding minority rights. (resolution 55/2,\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration, para. 25)\r\nThe principles and practices of democracy and respect\r\nfor human rights, including minority rights, are\r\nindispensable to security and peace in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. My Government is confident that cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nwill contribute greatly to peace and security.\r\nMr. erknys (Lithuania): Allow me to take this\r\nopportunity to welcome the Secretary General of the\r\nCouncil of Europe and the members of the delegation\r\nfrom the Parliamentary Assembly.\r\nLet me start by expressing my appreciation for\r\nthere being an agenda item on cooperation between the\r\nCouncil of Europe and the United Nations. It provides\r\na good opportunity to discuss possible ways for these\r\ntwo organizations to cooperate and how this regional\r\ninstitution might contribute to our work.\r\nDespite some ongoing cooperation, the Council\r\nof Europe and its work have not received enough\r\nattention within the United Nations. Putting\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly and adopting a resolution on this item is a\r\nsignificant step in this direction.\r\nLithuania has always actively supported close\r\ncooperation between the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations. The Council is in a position to make a\r\nsignificant contribution to the work of the United\r\nNations, in particular in strengthening of democratic\r\nsecurity and in those fields where the Councils\r\nexpertise is well recognized: the rule of law, human\r\nrights and social and economic rights.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThis year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe opening for signature of the European Convention\r\non Human Rights. Post-war Western European\r\nGovernments set out a list of basic human rights and\r\nfreedoms, with the aim of achieving democracy and\r\nlasting stability on the continent. After 50 years we can\r\nsay that the protection and promotion of individual\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms have become\r\nan indispensable part of Europes identity.\r\nSince the organizations establishment, its shape\r\nand the scope of its work have undergone major\r\nchanges. The arrival of Central and Eastern European\r\ncountries in the 1990s meant that the institution\r\nbecame fully pan-European. Due to the new global\r\nchallenges, the Council had to adapt to a new\r\nenvironment, which has become more diverse and\r\ncomplex. New priorities have been emerging. These\r\ninclude migration, social exclusion, minorities and\r\ncorruption, as well as environmental protection, AIDS,\r\ndrugs and organized crime.\r\nThe fact that countries from other continents\r\nshow interest in the work of the Council greatly\r\nencourages us to promote the experience and\r\nachievements of the organization. We take this\r\nopportunity to welcome Mexico as the newest observer\r\nto the Council, which it has been since the end of last\r\nyear.\r\nMost of the issues and challenges dealt with at\r\nthe regional level by the Council of Europe are the\r\nsame as those we face at the United Nations. Therefore,\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nwe see ample opportunities for constructive and\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Council of Europe.\r\nOne of the main areas is the exchange of\r\ninformation and experience between the two\r\norganizations in the sphere of the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights and freedoms. In this\r\nregard, we attach great importance to the already\r\nongoing cooperation between the Council of Europe\r\nand the officers of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioners for both Human Rights and Refugees.\r\nOne example that might be singled out is the European\r\nConference against Racism, which also dealt with\r\nintolerance, organized last week by the Council in\r\npreparation for the United Nations World Conference\r\nagainst racism to be held next year in South Africa. We\r\nalso welcome the contributions of the Council of\r\nEurope to the United Nations special sessions,\r\nBeijing + 5 and Copenhagen + 5.\r\nThe Council of Europe plays an important role in\r\nimplementing in the European countries the principles\r\nenshrined in the universal human rights instruments. In\r\naddition, we would welcome the Councils contributing\r\nto the work of the United Nations by making available\r\nthe Councils expertise in strengthening human rights,\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. We would also welcome\r\nthe opening of a liaison office of the Council of Europe\r\nin New York, which would facilitate the sharing of\r\ninformation between the two organizations.\r\nConflict-prevention activities are another area\r\nwhere the Council of Europe could contribute\r\nsubstantially. The Councils legal framework for the\r\nprotection of human rights and its mechanism for\r\nmonitoring the obligations of member States\r\ndemonstrate its expertise in this field. Moreover, the\r\nCouncils achievements in the field of building\r\ndemocratic security, confidence-building measures, the\r\nprotection of children, the protection of national\r\nminorities and the fight against racism might be very\r\nbeneficial to these efforts.\r\nIn this regard, we commend the valuable ongoing\r\ncontribution of the Council of Europe to the continued\r\nfull and rigorous implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999). The Council of Europe has\r\nestablished close working relations with the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\r\n(UNMIK) on a wide array of issues.\r\nIn 2001 Lithuania will assume the presidency of\r\nthe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.\r\nAmong other priorities, emphasis will be placed on the\r\nconsolidation of the Councils efforts to foster the\r\nvalues of human rights, civil society and democratic\r\nstability throughout the continent. The experience of\r\nsuccessful cooperation between the United Nations\r\ninstitutions and the Council of Europe in the Balkans\r\ndemonstrates that constructive working relations\r\nbetween the two organizations would also be of great\r\nvalue.\r\nIn conclusion, I express my hope that the\r\ninclusion of this item on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly and the adoption of a resolution will give us\r\nan opportunity to exchange views about possible ways\r\nfor these two organizations to cooperate, and will also\r\nprepare a good framework for establishing a target-\r\noriented constructive relationship.\r\nMr. Kouliev (Azerbaijan) (spoke in Russian): At\r\nthe outset, I wish to thank the Government of Italy for\r\nhaving taken the initiative of including this item on the\r\nagenda of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly and for having introduced the draft\r\nresolution on this item. Its adoption will undoubtedly\r\ngive new impetus to the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe, the basis for\r\nwhich was established in 1951.\r\nI am also pleased to welcome among us the\r\nSecretary-General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Walter\r\nSchwimmer, and the delegation of the Sub-Committee\r\non relations with non-member countries of the\r\nParliamentary Assembly, whose presence here today\r\ntestifies to the importance of the item under\r\nconsideration.\r\nThe Council of Europe, established in 1949, was\r\nthe first pan-European political institution. The goals\r\nand tasks of the organization are the achievement of\r\ngreater unity among its member States through\r\ncooperation in all spheres, except for military issues,\r\non the basis of a single value system comprising\r\ndedication to democracy, respect for human rights and\r\nthe primacy of law. The implementation and promotion\r\nof such values are the concrete mandate and raison\r\ndêtre of the Council of Europe.\r\nAzerbaijans entry into the Council of Europe and\r\nadherence to European conventions and other\r\ninternational legal instruments were an historical and\r\nstrategic necessity. This aspiration was directly defined\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nby the deliberate choice of our people, which considers\r\nitself to be an inalienable part of Europe, to establish\r\nEuropean values and standards in Azerbaijan.\r\nOver the years of its independence, Azerbaijan\r\nhas achieved significant progress in political, social,\r\neconomic and cultural development. Our country has\r\nsignificantly strengthened political and economic\r\nstability. A constructive dialogue among the various\r\npolitical forces, free activity of the mass media and the\r\ngradual introduction of market reforms have become\r\nopen realities in todays Azerbaijan. In the past four\r\nyears, from the moment Azerbaijan requested full\r\nmembership of the Council of Europe, we have\r\nachieved great progress in ensuring the primacy of law,\r\nthe protection of human rights and the building of a\r\ndemocratic society.\r\nI wish to inform the Assembly that the Republic\r\nof Azerbaijan has begun to implement its post-\r\napplication commitments, as set down in Opinion No.\r\n222 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of\r\nEurope. Azerbaijan has adhered to 14 conventions of\r\nthe Council of Europe and in February 1998 was the\r\nfirst country in the region to abolish capital\r\npunishment. The next important step on the road to\r\ndemocratic reform was the abolishment of press\r\ncensorship in August 1998.\r\nIn recent years, in the context of judicial reform,\r\nAzerbaijan has taken a number of steps to bring our\r\njudicial-legal system into conformity with international\r\nstandards, including the requirements of the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights, its Protocols and other\r\nEuropean instruments. Azerbaijans legal system has\r\nalso established a tripartite judicial system consisting\r\nof a high court, an appeals court and a constitutional\r\ncourt, which in turn serves to strengthen the trust of\r\ncitizens in the legal system.\r\nAzerbaijan is currently preparing for\r\nparliamentary elections scheduled for November 5. The\r\nlegal basis for these elections is laid down in the\r\nConstitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and in\r\nrecently adopted laws and normative acts in conformity\r\nwith international requirements. I would also stress the\r\nspecial role played by the expert assistance supplied by\r\ninternational organizations, including the Office for\r\nDemocratic Institutions and Human Rights of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and the European Commission for Democracy\r\nthrough Law, in the preparation of electoral legislation\r\nand in the improved implementation of these laws. The\r\ngreat majority of these recommendations have already\r\nbeen taken into account by the Government and\r\nAzerbaijan is prepared to pursue this successful\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Government of Azerbaijan is taking all the\r\nnecessary measures to hold free and fair elections. I\r\nwish briefly to affirm that the Central Election\r\nCommission has taken the decision to allow most\r\nleading political parties, including the opposition, to\r\nparticipate in the forthcoming parliamentary elections\r\non a proportional basis. During the elections, we will\r\nalso establish the conditions necessary to inviting\r\nnumerous observers. It is well known that Azerbaijan\r\nalready hosts a long-term Observation Mission of the\r\nOSCE and we are inviting observers from the Council\r\nof Europe as well.\r\nThe aforementioned reforms and other actions\r\nthat we have undertaken will also be further\r\nimplemented. This process has become irreversible. Of\r\ncourse, problems and difficulties remain, but we are\r\novercoming them with the very important help of\r\nexperts, including those from the Council of Europe.\r\nIt is well known that Azerbaijan is experiencing a\r\ndifficult moment in its history. The sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of our country are being cruelly\r\nviolated by a neighbouring State. One fifth of our\r\ncountrys territory remains under the occupation of\r\nArmenian forces, while 1 million Azerbaijani refugees\r\nand displaced persons continue to suffer. The ongoing\r\n12-year armed conflict between Azerbaijan and\r\nArmenia has not only harmed Azerbaijan, but is also\r\npreventing the establishment of stability throughout the\r\nsouthern Caucasus and delaying the democratic\r\ndevelopment of our States.\r\nIt is well known that, in 1993, the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council adopted four resolutions demanding\r\nthe unconditional withdrawal of occupation forces from\r\nthe territory of Azerbaijan. As of 1992, the OSCE has\r\ndealt directly with the settlement of the conflict.\r\nUnfortunately, the resolutions and decisions adopted\r\nhave yet to be implemented.\r\nIn spite of the difficult and tense situation, the\r\nleadership of Azerbaijan is observing the ceasefire\r\nregime and doing its utmost to hasten the settlement\r\nprocess. In its recent letters to the Secretary-General of\r\nthe Council of Europe and the President of the\r\nCouncils Parliamentary Assembly, the President of\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nAzerbaijan again reaffirmed my countrys commitment\r\nto settling the conflict peacefully on the basis of the\r\nnorms and principles of international law in the\r\nframework of the OSCE Minsk Group.\r\nThe strengthening and harmonization of relations\r\nwith the Council of Europe will be significantly\r\npromoted by joint action in the context of Azerbaijans\r\ncooperation programme with that organization. I wish\r\nto stress that the positive influence of the speeding and\r\nstrengthening of reforms in Azerbaijan and of the\r\nenhancing of democratic institutions in our country is\r\nbeing exerted through the close cooperation of\r\nAzerbaijan and the Council of Europe within the\r\nframework of the programme of Activities for the\r\nDevelopment and Consolidation of Democratic\r\nStability. We are prepared to discuss with the Council\r\nof Europe ways and means to improve the programmes\r\nfor cooperation.\r\nWe regard entry into the Council of Europe not as\r\na goal in itself, but as the beginning of a long-term\r\npartnership within the framework of a united Europe,\r\ndesigned for the further improvement of the bases\r\nestablished in recent years of a democratic and free\r\nsociety in Azerbaijan.\r\nThe Council of Europe, the sole pan-European\r\norganization, can make a substantial contribution to\r\nsolving the growing problems of the United Nations. It\r\ncan also make a substantial contribution in those areas\r\nin which its experience is recognized, in particular in\r\nhelping to establish pluralistic democratic States based\r\non the primacy of law and respect for human rights.\r\nThe Council of Europe can thereby promote the\r\nreaffirmation  especially on the European\r\ncontinent  of the ideals set forth in the United\r\nNations Charter and their propagation elsewhere in the\r\nworld. That is why we support todays draft resolution\r\nand hope that it will be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): We fully associate\r\nourselves with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of France on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. We have asked to add our voice to the subject,\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, because, like many other States,\r\nwe are members of both organizations and well aware\r\nof the lofty principles and high ideals they both serve.\r\nWhat is more, this is the first time this item has been\r\ndebated in the General Assembly. Of course, we would\r\nlike also to express our deep appreciation to the Italian\r\ndelegation for taking the initiative for the inscription of\r\nthe item on the agenda, its allocation to a plenary\r\nmeeting and its presentation here.\r\nThe United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nshare many common goals, and therefore closer\r\ncooperation and coordination between them would\r\nrender both more vital players on crucial issues such as\r\nhuman rights and basic freedoms. The fields of\r\ncooperation between the two are too numerous to\r\nrepeat. The draft resolution introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of Italy, of which Cyprus is a sponsor,\r\nrefers to the most striking examples of cooperation,\r\nsuch as issues of international law, development,\r\nwomens rights, racism and intolerance, Kosovo,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and refugees  the list goes\r\non.\r\nThere is no doubt in our minds that both\r\norganizations will be benefited by this cooperation,\r\nespecially in the areas of common endeavours, with\r\nmankind the ultimate main beneficiary. We therefore\r\nwholeheartedly support this cooperation.\r\nCyprus, over the years of its membership in the\r\nCouncil of Europe, has witnessed the Councils\r\nconstructive contribution to human rights and\r\ninternational law. In the case of the problem of Cyprus,\r\nthe role of the Council of Europe has been very\r\nconstructive. In this regard, we take the opportunity to\r\nexpress to Mr. Schwimmer, the Secretary General of\r\nthe Council, and the distinguished European\r\nparliamentarians present today, our deep appreciation.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): Austria highly\r\nwelcomes this first General Assembly discussion on\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, especially in the presence of the\r\nSecretary General of the Council, Mr. Walter\r\nSchwimmer, and the parliamentarians of the Council of\r\nEurope. The Austrian Government and people have\r\nbeen deeply committed to both global and regional\r\norganizations since the very beginning of our\r\nmembership in 1955, 45 years ago.\r\nChapter VIII of the United Nations Charter refers\r\nto the possibility of regional organizations sharing the\r\nburden of keeping peace. Consequently, there is ample\r\nopportunity for a division of labour between the United\r\nNations and the Council of Europe, especially in the\r\nfield of conflict prevention and settlement. It is now up\r\nto us, the Member States, to support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, and Secretary General Walter\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nSchwimmer in their efforts to intensify the dialogue\r\nand cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nIn this respect, Austria was pleased to note that\r\nan excellent meeting of the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations took place in Strasbourg on 3 October\r\nwith the Secretary General of the Council of Europe\r\nand representatives of the Council.\r\nThe Council of Europe is the central focus for the\r\nprotection of human rights and democratic rights in\r\nEurope, and is committed, as Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan has rightly pointed out, to creating a culture of\r\nhuman rights throughout the European continent.\r\nConsidering the goals of the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil, it is obvious that fields of cooperation\r\nabound: human rights, education, monitoring of\r\nelections, protection of children, gender equality, the\r\nfight against corruption  to just name a few.\r\nA good recent example is the European\r\nConference against Racism, held in Strasbourg, which\r\nwill be an important contribution and input to the\r\nWorld Conference against racism to be held in South\r\nAfrica next year. I would also like to emphasize the\r\nrole of the Council as partner of the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo. The\r\nCouncil has demonstrated its determination to be an\r\nactive member in the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to assist in solving a major humanitarian\r\nconflict.\r\nAustria therefore fully supports a further\r\nintensification of the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations, and welcomes the idea of a Council of\r\nEurope presence in New York in the form of a liaison\r\noffice. This would permit a continuous dialogue\r\nbetween our organizations. We are confident that our\r\nmeeting today, in which we will adopt the first General\r\nAssembly resolution on this item, will be an important\r\nstep towards intensified cooperation in the future.\r\nMr. Atkinson (United Kingdom): The delegation\r\nof France has already spoken on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. My delegation fully endorses that statement and\r\nwould like to make a few further points.\r\nThe United Kingdom welcomes the forthcoming\r\nadoption of the draft resolution; it usefully clarifies the\r\nareas in which the United Nations and the Council of\r\nEurope will continue to cooperate, and we should use\r\nthis opportunity to focus on producing practical results.\r\nWhen the Council of Europe commenced its\r\nannual visits to this General Assembly in 1997, through\r\nits sub-committee on relations with non-member\r\ncountries, we found to our horror that our organization\r\nwas neither recognized by the United Nations as a\r\nregional organization nor accorded a regular\r\ncooperation debate in this Assembly, unlike many of\r\nthe other regional organizations. This was a particular\r\nsurprise to us, because, as we have been reminded in\r\nthis debate, the Council of Europe is the largest and the\r\noldest of Europes institutions, born, like the United\r\nNations itself, out of the ashes of the last world war. It\r\nconcerned us greatly, because of the valuable\r\ncontributions which the Council of Europe has made\r\nand continues to make to the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThus we are delighted that cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe is being\r\ndebated in this Assembly today for the very first time.\r\nAnd so we pay tribute to the Italian presidency of the\r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for\r\nenabling it to take place, and to the untiring work of\r\nour Danish rapporteur, Hanne Severinsen.\r\nThe Brahimi report (A/55/305) has launched a\r\nnew debate on the prevention of conflict. As I hope is\r\nno longer disputed, the best prevention of conflict is\r\nthe promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule\r\nof law. There are few, if any, examples of a democracy\r\nin conflict with another democracy, and it is here that\r\nwe believe the Council of Europe can make a major\r\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations.\r\nSince 1989  over the past 12 years  the\r\nnumber of member States of the Council of Europe has\r\nincreased from 23 to 41, and possibly it will be 45 next\r\nyear. To accede to the Council of Europe a country\r\nmust be committed to achieving our standards of\r\ndemocracy, to be subjected to the detailed scrutiny of\r\nits commitments and to accept the jurisdiction of our\r\nEuropean Court of Human Rights. It is this unique\r\nexperience of the working of our institutions and\r\ninstruments and of our monitoring procedures which\r\ncontributes to the prevention of conflict in Europe and\r\nwhich we believe can contribute much more to the\r\nwork of the United Nations.\r\nThere are four specific examples of the\r\ncontribution the Council of Europe makes to the work\r\nof the United Nations to which I wish to draw the\r\nattention of the Assembly.\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nFirst, the important work of our North-South\r\nCentre in Lisbon, which raises awareness in Europe to\r\nthe problems of poverty and depravation throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nSecondly, the solution we believe we have\r\nproduced to one of the final status issues to be resolved\r\nin the Middle East peace process  that of the three\r\nand a quarter million displaced Palestine refugees, over\r\none million of whom live in the 59 camps run by the\r\nUnited Nations through its Relief and Works Agency.\r\nWe believe that the Council of Europes 1998 report on\r\nthis issue offers a practical solution to this problem.\r\nThirdly, in the area of conflict prevention, the\r\nCouncil of Europe has delivered practical assistance to\r\nand support for the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999), most recently in providing a mission to observe\r\nthe Kosovo regional elections. It has also cooperated\r\nwith the United Nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina in\r\nproviding human rights training to the judiciary and\r\npolice and it contributes to the Stability Pact\r\nprogramme for South-Eastern Europe.\r\nFourthly, the forthcoming Council of Europe\r\ncontribution to next years United Nations Year of the\r\nVolunteer, which our Social, Health and Family Affairs\r\nCommittee is currently preparing.\r\nMay I, in conclusion, draw the Assemblys\r\nattention to the fact that the Parliamentary Assembly of\r\nthe Council of Europe is composed of national\r\ndelegations who are members of our national\r\nParliaments and it is this parliamentary dimension to\r\nthe work of our organization which we believe has\r\ncontributed to the relative peace and expanding\r\ndemocracy and human rights in Europe over the past\r\nfifty years. This parliamentary dimension, which we\r\nrecommend, should now be introduced into the work of\r\nthe United Nations as has been proposed by the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU). We believe that practical\r\npoliticians can find new solutions when Governments\r\nhave reached deadlock. And that is the clear message\r\nthat I hope will result from this first historic debate on\r\ncooperation between our two organizations today.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): I should like to begin by\r\nexpressing our appreciation to the Italian delegation for\r\nintroducing the draft resolution on Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe,\r\ncontained in document A/55/L.8, which my delegation\r\nhas joined in sponsoring.\r\nMay I also welcome the Secretary General of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, Mr. Schwimmer, and the delegation\r\nfrom the Councils Parliamentary Assembly.\r\nThe Council of Europe was founded in 1949 as\r\nthe first political institution in Europe. The main aims\r\nof the organization are to achieve greater unity between\r\nits member States through cooperation in all fields,\r\nexcept military, and on the basis of shared values of\r\ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law.\r\nDemocracy, human rights, respect for the\r\nindividual, security and stability and a Europe free\r\nfrom conflict are not in themselves new ideas. Born in\r\nEurope, they have achieved universal relevance and\r\nrecognition beyond the borders of Europe itself. What\r\nis new, however, is that one can adopt and advocate\r\nthese values through appropriate institutional\r\narrangements. It is in that sense that the Council of\r\nEurope is both a means to an end, as well as a\r\nworthwhile objective in itself.\r\nThe end of the cold war era gave the countries of\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe an historic opportunity to\r\nreturn to European values and ideals, to restore to\r\ndemocratic institutions the mechanisms needed to\r\ncreate the political dimension that would allow them to\r\nengage in dialogue, partnership and cooperation with\r\nall other existing democracies.\r\nIt should be noted that most of those countries did\r\nnot miss this unique opportunity and succeeded in\r\nrestoring democracy, which eventually made possible\r\ntheir accession to the Council of Europe.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the activities of the\r\nCouncil aimed at the support of the democratic\r\nprocesses in countries in transition and at providing all\r\npossible opportunities for greater involvement in\r\nEuropean structures and affairs.\r\nArmenia was among the countries that did not\r\nmiss the opportunity. It did not undertake its own\r\ndemocratization process simply in order to join the\r\nCouncil. It does recognize, however, that, having\r\nstarted the process of reform, the need to consolidate\r\nits achievements, as well as the need to go further in a\r\nfirm and irrevocable manner, requires that it seek to\r\nintegrate itself into the institutional framework  that\r\nis, the Council. The Council is a model and an\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\ninspiration as well as the guarantor of the legitimacy of\r\nour own undertakings on the road to democratization.\r\nOver the past few years, we have attempted to\r\nmaintain a steady course in preparing for our\r\nmembership. In doing so, we have continued to look at\r\nthe way in which those ahead of us have attempted to\r\nembody the values of the Council of Europe by making\r\nthose values significant in the conduct of their own\r\naffairs.\r\nIn 1996, we applied to join the Council of Europe\r\nand earlier this year, on 29 June, at the Parliamentary\r\nAssembly of the Council, Armenias full membership\r\nwas recommended to the Committee of Ministers,\r\nstating that Armenia is moving towards a democratic\r\npluralist society in which human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw are respected and, in accordance with Article 4 of\r\nthe Statute of the Council of Europe, is able and\r\nwilling to pursue democratic reforms. The final\r\ndecision is to be taken by the Council of Europe\r\nCommittee of Ministers in one of its upcoming\r\nmeetings.\r\nWe understand that there is a common view\r\namong members of the Council to invite Armenia and\r\nAzerbaijan together to join the Council. At the same\r\ntime, there are some concerns and reservations on the\r\npart of several members with regard to Azerbaijans\r\naccession to the Council following its parliamentary\r\nelections. Furthermore, there are calls by member\r\nStates to make Azerbaijans accession altogether\r\ncontingent upon its handling of elections.\r\nArmenias support for the joint accession of\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan notwithstanding, we are not\r\nlikely to support any further linkage between the two\r\ncountries beyond the date of Azerbaijans\r\nparliamentary elections.\r\nGiven our past disappointing experience in this\r\nconnection, we have serious concerns about further\r\ndelays in Armenias full membership. We would urge\r\nmember States to de-link the two countries\r\nmembership issue and judge each countrys\r\nqualification for membership on its own merits. We are\r\nnot reluctant to admit that the South Caucasus is a\r\nsubregion whose democratic restructuring is not yet\r\nfully complete. A stable and democratic South\r\nCaucasus is a work in progress. As in all work in\r\nprogress its promise must not ignore the fragility of its\r\nemerging equilibrium. We recognize and welcome the\r\nconstructive role that the Council of Europe can, and\r\nmust, play to consolidate this equilibrium, but it must\r\nnot, perhaps inadvertently, by uneven or inconsistent\r\napplication of its principles, exacerbate existing\r\nimbalances.\r\nCooperation between the Council of Europe and\r\nthe United Nations started in 1951 with the Agreement\r\nbetween the Council of Europe and the Secretariat of\r\nthe United Nations, which was updated in 1971. The\r\nCouncil provides the framework and the\r\nappropriate mechanism for protecting, promoting and\r\nimplementing human rights and we acknowledge the\r\ncontribution of the Council of Europe to the protection\r\nand the strengthening of democracy, human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms and the rule of law on the\r\nEuropean continent, including its activities against\r\nracism and intolerance, the promotion of gender\r\nequality, social development and a common cultural\r\nheritage.\r\nIn recent years, the Council of Europe has been\r\ninvolved in renewed cooperation with the United\r\nNations, mainly in relation to crisis situations in\r\nEurope. In 1993, the United Nations Office in Geneva,\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) and the Council of Europe established\r\nthe practice of holding tripartite high-level meetings to\r\nexchange information and to promote coordination of\r\ntheir activities in areas of common concern.\r\nAt the dawn of the new century it is very timely\r\nfor the General Assembly to examine ways and means\r\nof further developing the already advanced cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with\r\nresolution 44/6, of 17 October 1989, I now call on the\r\nSecretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Walter\r\nSchwimmer.\r\nMr. Schwimmer (Council of Europe): It is a\r\ngreat honour and privilege for me to be the first\r\nSecretary General of the Council of Europe to address\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly. Todays debate\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe marks a breakthrough in the\r\nrelations between our institutions. This is the occasion,\r\nI am convinced, to discuss how the Council of Europe\r\ncan even better contribute concretely and specifically\r\nto the work of the United Nations. In other words, how\r\ncan we increase our added value?\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nMy sincere thanks go to the Parliamentary\r\nAssembly of the Council of Europe for having\r\noriginally proposed this debate, and to Italy, currently\r\nchairing our Committee of Ministers, for having taken\r\nup the suggestion and having introduced the draft\r\nresolution before the Assembly. Important impetus was\r\nalso provided by the permanent representative of\r\nFinland in Strasbourg.\r\nThis debate has already given an impressive and\r\nconvincing description of what the Council of Europe\r\nstands for. Our Organization, which currently consists\r\nof 41 member States, first and foremost represents the\r\nEurope of shared values. The organization embodies\r\nthe shared commitment of 800 million Europeans to\r\nhuman rights, democracy and the rule of law. Sharing\r\nour values are the Councils non-European observer\r\nStates  Canada, Japan, Mexico and the United States.\r\nWe also value our cooperation with the Holy See,\r\nwhich enjoys a similar status.\r\nSince the end of the cold war the Council of\r\nEurope has become a truly pan-European organization,\r\nwith 17 new members having been admitted in the past\r\ndecade. Our achievements include, notably, over 170\r\nmultilateral conventions, several of which are also\r\nopen to non-member States. Next month we shall\r\ncelebrate in Rome the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights, with its\r\nunique protection mechanism, which enables\r\nindividuals to obtain binding court decisions on their\r\ncomplaints against member States.\r\nOur increase in membership has been\r\naccompanied by a growing emphasis on cooperation\r\nand assistance programmes to strengthen democratic\r\nstability. In brief, through its standard-setting and\r\ndemocracy-building activities, the Council of Europe is\r\nmaking a major contribution to long-term conflict\r\nprevention in Europe. I do not need to convince the\r\nAssembly that such conflict prevention is at infinitely\r\nlower cost than conflict resolution. If other\r\norganizations are sometimes called upon to act as fire\r\nbrigades, the Council of Europe can be considered as\r\nthe fire prevention system. In addition, in recent times\r\nthe Council of Europe has increasingly become\r\ninvolved in what the United Nations Brahimi report\r\n(A/55/305) refers to as peace-building, notably in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, and to some\r\nextent in Chechnya.\r\nIn which areas do the Council of Europe and the\r\nUnited Nations already cooperate? Let me give but a\r\nfew examples. Together with the United Nations, we\r\nare actively engaged in fighting racism, xenophobia\r\nand intolerance. Last week, we organized the European\r\nConference against racism and intolerance in\r\npreparation for next years United Nations World\r\nConference in South Africa. Close cooperation exists\r\nwith the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, who was present for the entire\r\nConference in Strasbourg last week, as well as with the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nThe Council of Europe made a significant\r\ncontribution to the special sessions of the General\r\nAssembly this year on women and social development.\r\nWe also intend to actively contribute to the\r\nforthcoming special session on the follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit for Children.\r\nOur Congress of Local and Regional Authorities,\r\nwhich is the political assembly of local and regional\r\npoliticians from our member countries, is assisting in\r\nthe preparation for this General Assembly of a world\r\ncharter of local self-government.\r\nA clear expression of the Council of Europes\r\nsharing the concern of the United Nations for\r\ndemocracy and human rights worldwide is its North-\r\nSouth Centre in Lisbon, which seeks to raise public\r\nawareness in Europe on global interdependence issues\r\nand to promote human rights, pluralist democracy and\r\nsocial cohesion in other parts of the world.\r\nWe cooperate on the ground in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina; in Kosovo we actively contribute to the\r\nwork of the United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo\r\n(UNMIK), and, at UNMIKs request, we have assumed\r\nresponsibility for the observation of the electoral\r\nprocess.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who made a\r\nvery valuable visit to the Council of Europe two weeks\r\nago  was also in a position to appreciate, many\r\ncombined efforts are already under way. However, I am\r\nconvinced that those efforts could be intensified even\r\nmore, and that they should be made more politically\r\nevident. Let me illustrate this by referring to some of\r\nour most pressing concerns at the moment.\r\nRecent developments in the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, like the fall of the Berlin Wall, herald the\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nbeginning of a new era in European politics. The\r\nCouncil of Europe has therefore warmly welcomed the\r\ncourageous choice by the Serbian people in favour of\r\ndemocracy. The Committee of Ministers, the\r\nParliamentary Assembly and I have already invited the\r\nnew President, Mr. Kostunica, to come to Strasbourg\r\nfor high-level meetings at the beginning of November.\r\nI am very proud that he has accepted.\r\nA Council of Europe delegation is at present in\r\nBelgrade to discuss future relations and possible\r\nassistance programmes with the new leadership. I am\r\nconvinced, however, that the transition in the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia will be completed only when\r\nMr. Milosević, the Butcher of the Balkans, is brought\r\nto justice. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year, the key to deterring crimes\r\nagainst humanity lies in the battle against the impunity\r\nof the perpetrators.\r\nWhile there are thus high hopes and expectations\r\nwith regard to the Balkans, the fatally flawed elections\r\nin Belarus last Sunday showed that democracy has not\r\nyet won everywhere in Europe.\r\nThe situation in Chechnya, which is very serious,\r\nremains of particular concern. The Council of Europe\r\nhas repeatedly expressed its grave concern about\r\nhuman rights violations there. A recent hearing of the\r\nRussian State Duma, which I was able to attend, made\r\nit clear that much remains to be done. The Council of\r\nEuropes most tangible contribution has been its\r\nassistance in the setting up of the office of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Russian President for Human\r\nRights in Chechnya, Mr. Vladimir Kalamanov.\r\nAlthough the office has made an encouraging start, the\r\ntest of its success will be the effective follow-up it can\r\ngive to the already over 4,000 complaints brought by\r\nthe people of the region.\r\nI also wish once more to express my concern\r\nabout the fate of the more than 18,000 persons reported\r\nmissing since the conflict began and the hundreds of\r\nthousands of internally displaced persons who live\r\nunder very difficult circumstances. It is my sincere\r\nhope that the competent agencies of the United Nations\r\nand non-governmental organizations will soon be able\r\nto become fully operational in Chechnya.\r\nLet me finally mention our neighbouring region,\r\nthe Middle East, which has been the scene of such\r\nhorrific events in recent days. In particular, the Council\r\nof Europes Parliamentary Assembly, with which the\r\nIsraeli Knesset has enjoyed observer status since 1957,\r\nhas been very active in efforts to promote dialogue\r\nbetween the parties. It was, in fact, one of the first\r\nforums to bring Israeli legislators and Palestinian\r\nrepresentatives together. We stand ready to make any\r\ncontribution that may be deemed useful to facilitate the\r\ncontinuation of that dialogue following this weeks\r\nagreement at Sharm el-Sheikh.\r\nI opened my statement by asking how the Council\r\nof Europe could contribute even better to the work of\r\nthe United Nations. I believe that recognition of the\r\nCouncil of Europe as a regional organization within the\r\nmeaning of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter\r\nwould be an important step forward. First, this would\r\nbe a political acknowledgement of the contribution the\r\norganization makes to conflict prevention and peace-\r\nbuilding in Europe. It would, furthermore, enhance the\r\nCouncil of Europes role as a model for other\r\ncontinents in the fields of human rights, democracy and\r\nthe rule of law. Existing cooperation on the ground in\r\nareas such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo\r\nwould obtain a clearer political mandate. Finally, it\r\nwould add increased relevance to what I hope will be\r\nan annual discussion in the General Assembly about\r\nour contribution to the work of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, let me thank all delegations that\r\ncontributed to this important debate, and all\r\ndelegations that associated themselves with the French\r\nstatement on behalf of the European Union. Special\r\nhanks to go the delegations of our applicant\r\ncountries  Armenia, Azerbaijan and Monaco  for\r\ntheir statements.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item. We shall now proceed to the\r\nconsideration of draft resolution A/55/L.8.\r\nBefore the Assembly proceeds to take action on\r\nthe draft resolution, I should like to announce that,\r\nsince its introduction, the following countries have\r\nbecome sponsors of draft resolution A/55/L.8:\r\nAzerbaijan, Canada, Japan, Monaco and the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/55/L.8?\r\nDraft resolution A/55/L.8 was adopted (resolution\r\n55/3).\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 170?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 181\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision\r\ntaken at its 37th plenary meeting, held on 19 October\r\n2000, the General Assembly will now consider agenda\r\nitem 181.\r\nMr. Bossière (France) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe honour to address the Assembly on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. The Central and Eastern European\r\ncountries associated with the European Union \r\nBulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,\r\nLatvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and\r\nSlovenia  and the associated countries Cyprus, Malta\r\nand Turkey, as well as the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation country member of the European\r\nEconomic Area Iceland, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nLet me begin by welcoming the fact that the\r\nrecent signing of the agreement governing relations\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons provides an\r\nopportunity for the General Assembly, for the first\r\ntime, to take note in plenary meeting of the\r\nconsiderable progress towards the elimination of\r\nchemical weapons that has been made since the 1993\r\nconclusion of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\r\nI cannot overemphasize the importance that the\r\nEuropean Union attaches to the Convention. The\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is\r\none of the international communitys outstanding steps\r\nforward in the sphere of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation: for the first time, a treaty has created an\r\ninternational organization effectively to verify the\r\nelimination, within a specific timeframe, of an entire\r\ncategory of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe Conventions large number of States\r\nparties  140 to date  and the many ratifications\r\nover the past year prove the international communitys\r\ncontinued support for that instrument, and are\r\nparticularly encouraging for disarmament. Thus,\r\nseveral continents, including Europe, are already fully\r\ncovered by the provisions of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. The European\r\nUnion takes this opportunity to call upon States that\r\nhave not yet done so to sign and ratify the Convention\r\non the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as soon as\r\npossible, and reaffirms its support for efforts to attain\r\nuniversal adherence.\r\nStrengthening the authority of the Treaty requires\r\nalso that all States parties fulfil their obligations.\r\nCooperation between States parties and the Technical\r\nSecretariat of the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons has enabled that organization to\r\nmake great progress in implementing the Convention.\r\nAll States parties have submitted their initial\r\ndeclarations, and a strict and effective inspection\r\nsystem has been successfully put in place to verify the\r\naccuracy of those declarations. These accomplishments\r\nhave increased transparency and have made it possible\r\nto create a climate of greater trust with respect to all\r\nmatters related to chemical weapons.\r\nThe European Union wishes also to recall the\r\nimportance it attaches to the destruction by chemical-\r\nweapon States of all their stockpiles of such weapons\r\nas soon as possible, and within the timeframe set out in\r\nthe Convention. The European Union does not\r\nunderestimate the difficulties faced by some States in\r\nallocating the resources necessary for the destruction of\r\ntheir chemical weapons. It has therefore decided, in the\r\nframework of its Joint Action of 17 December 1999, to\r\nallocate 5.9 million euros to help in the construction of\r\na chemical weapons destruction plant in Russia. The\r\nEuropean Union wishes nonetheless to stress that, by\r\nthe terms of the Convention, responsibility, including\r\nfinancial responsibility, for the destruction of chemical-\r\nweapons stockpiles lies solely with the States\r\npossessing such stockpiles.\r\nIt seems particularly appropriate for the General\r\nAssembly to acknowledge and support the efforts made\r\nby the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons in the area of disarmament. These efforts\r\nrepresent the best assurance we have that the twenty-\r\nfirst century will be free from the scourge of chemical\r\nweapons. In the shorter term, we hope also that the\r\nprogress that has been made in the implementation of\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention will help give\r\nimpetus to the negotiations currently under way in\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nGeneva on an effective protocol for strengthening the\r\nBiological Weapons Convention. The conclusion of\r\nthese negotiations before the end of 2001, pursuant to\r\nthe decision taken in 1996 by the parties to the\r\nnegotiations, will contribute usefully to supplementing\r\nand strengthening the achievements of the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention in the area of disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nEgypt on a point of order.\r\nMr. Darwish (Egypt): My delegation has asked\r\nfor the floor on a point of order to comment on certain\r\nprocedural matters pertaining to agenda item 8 and to\r\nagenda item 181, which is entitled Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\r\nGeneral Assembly document A/55/495 was\r\ndistributed on 18 October 2000, and a decision was\r\ntaken by the Assembly, during the morning of 19\r\nOctober, to waive the seven-day rule. That does not\r\ngive delegations ample time to consult with their\r\ncapitals on such matters, taking into account the fact\r\nthat the seven-day rule is rarely waived and that this is\r\ndone only when the matters under consideration are\r\nurgent.\r\nThe 24-hour rule also was waived with respect to\r\nthe decision to allow the Director-General of the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\r\n(OPCW) to speak from the rostrum. It is worth noting\r\nalso that the First Committee was in session yesterday\r\nmorning and that, accordingly, experts from that\r\nCommittee could not attend the General Assembly\r\nplenary.\r\nIt is the wish of my delegation that the practice I\r\nhave just described not constitute a precedent in future.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic on a point\r\nof order.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic\r\nhas asked to speak on a point of order to express its\r\nview on the procedure that was followed in dealing\r\nwith item 181 on Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation wishes to clarify\r\nthe following.\r\nFirst, the letter contained in document A/55/495\r\nwas circulated yesterday, and the decision was also\r\nmade yesterday. That document reached my delegation\r\nonly this morning. I believe that the waiver of the\r\nseven-day rule for reasons of urgency, and the waiver\r\nof the 24-hour rule in order to allow the Director-\r\nGeneral of the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons (OPCW) to make a statement from\r\nthe rostrum, are important issues. Sufficient time\r\nshould have been given to the members to thoroughly\r\nconsider this matter and prepare their responses.\r\nSecondly, my delegation wonders about the\r\nreasons for the use of these waivers, in particular as the\r\nsituation is not related to urgent matters that affect\r\ninternational peace and security. We believe that it\r\nwould have been instructive and useful in this case to\r\nabide by the procedures and regulations of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThirdly, my delegation hopes that this will not\r\nconstitute a precedent in the work of the General\r\nAssembly, in particular in relation to the OPCW and to\r\nthe statement by its Director-General from the rostrum\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nThe President: The statements made by the\r\nrepresentatives of Egypt and the Syrian Arab Republic\r\nwill be reflected in the record of this meeting.\r\nMr. Sanders (Netherlands): I should like to seize\r\nthis opportunity to express my great appreciation to the\r\nMember States for their positive response to the\r\nrequest by my Government for the inclusion in the\r\nagenda of an additional item 181, entitled Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and for\r\nallowing an oral debate to take place today.\r\nMy country has a special relationship with the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\r\n(OPCW). It is for this reason that I am taking the floor\r\nafter the representative of France, who spoke on behalf\r\nof the European Union, associated countries and other\r\ncountries.\r\nOf course, we fully associate ourselves with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of France. We\r\nalso support the draft resolution on the subject of\r\nchemical weapons that is under consideration in the\r\nFirst Committee. The Netherlands is proud and very\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\npleased to be the host country of the OPCW. We felt\r\nthat it was our duty as host country to propose that the\r\nGeneral Assembly be given the opportunity to react to\r\nthe important event that occurred last Tuesday, 17\r\nOctober. This was the signing of the Relationship\r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the OPCW,\r\na further milestone in the short history of the\r\nimplementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and Their Destruction. It may be\r\nrecalled that the Convention entered into force only in\r\n1997 and that since that date the organization and its\r\nState parties have made significant progress towards\r\nthe abolition of a whole category of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the destruction of existing stocks and the\r\nelimination of facilities for the production of chemical\r\nweapons. Thus, the OPCW contributes to eliminating\r\nreal threats to international, as well as regional, peace\r\nand security.\r\nWith the creation of an effective verification\r\nregime, the Convention has set an important precedent\r\nin confidence-building and disarmament. We are\r\nconvinced that the example set by the OPCW will\r\ncontinue to inspire States currently negotiating a\r\nsimilar regime to eliminate the threat of biological\r\nweapons. The Netherlands will do its part to help bring\r\nthese negotiations to a successful conclusion before the\r\nend of 2001. To give the new organization for the\r\nprohibition of biological weapons a head start, we shall\r\nmake sure that it benefits fully from the experience\r\ngained from working with its sister organization, the\r\nOPCW.\r\nMr. Snyder (United States of America): My\r\ndelegation would like to thank Director-General\r\nBustani for joining us today. We would also like to take\r\nthis opportunity to applaud the conclusion of the\r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons (OPCW). This Agreement marks the\r\nbeginning of a closer working relationship between\r\nthese two important organizations.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Relationship\r\nAgreement also has practical benefits. One such benefit\r\nis the further facilitation of the work and travel of\r\nOPCW inspectors. This will assist OPCW inspectors in\r\ncarrying out inspections expeditiously and efficiently.\r\nFinally, we would like to express our appreciation\r\nto the legal offices of both the United Nations\r\nSecretariat and the OPCW Technical Secretariat for\r\ntheir hard work in helping to bring this Agreement to\r\ncompletion.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of\r\nIran): After a long period of painstaking negotiation,\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention  a unique\r\nmultilateral disarmament treaty to eliminate an entire\r\nclass of weapons of mass destruction  entered into\r\nforce in 1997. The Chemical Weapons Convention,\r\nwith 140 States parties on board, now enjoys a great\r\ndeal of international support, legitimacy and relevance.\r\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons (OPCW), a newly established independent,\r\nautonomous international organization, has so far\r\nstriven to achieve the objectives and purposes of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons\r\nand on Their Destruction and to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of its provisions.\r\nSince its establishment, OPCW has conducted its\r\nactivities, as provided for under the Convention, in an\r\nefficient manner, verifying the compliance of the States\r\nparties with their obligations, and, as an international\r\nforum, facilitating consultations and cooperation\r\namong the States parties. Since its ratification of the\r\nConvention, the Islamic Republic of Iran, in the\r\ncontext of its long-standing commitment to the\r\nrealization of the Convention, and as the most recent\r\nvictim of these horrific weapons, has spared no effort\r\nto support the Convention and the implementation\r\nactivities of the OPCW.\r\nThe tireless efforts and activities of the\r\nDirector-General of the OPCW, Ambassador Bustani,\r\nand his staff in the course of the implementation of the\r\nConvention deserve our appreciation and support. We\r\ntherefore express our satisfaction with the inclusion of\r\nthe item on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the OPCW on the agenda of the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the General Assembly and welcome the presence of\r\nDirector-General Bustani of the OPCW here today.\r\nThe signature at this important juncture of the\r\nRelationship Agreement between the two\r\norganizations, in accordance with the Convention, is, in\r\nour view, a major step towards facilitating the\r\nimplementation of the Convention. The Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran was actively involved in the\r\nnegotiations on this Agreement. Following intensive\r\ndiscussions within the OPCW and with the constructive\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\ninvolvement of the United Nations Secretariat, the\r\ndifferences over some aspects of the Agreement were\r\nultimately resolved in a spirit of cooperation and\r\nunderstanding. We are pleased that this Agreement has\r\nnow been signed by the two organizations and is well\r\nplaced for implementation.\r\nThe common objective of the two\r\norganizations  to achieve effective progress towards\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament  will be widely\r\npromoted through the consolidation of their\r\nrelationship. In this regard, securing universality, as\r\none of the basic pillars upon which the Convention was\r\nfounded, is a necessity. In the Middle East region in\r\nparticular, there is still much to be done to secure the\r\nuniversality of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nThis will require the two organizations to utilize their\r\navailable means of cooperation to guarantee universal\r\nadherence to the Convention.\r\nMr. Xu Xiaodi (China) (spoke in Chinese): At the\r\noutset, I should like, on behalf of the Chinese\r\ndelegation, to welcome the inclusion on the agenda of\r\nthe current session the item regarding the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).\r\nSince the Chemical Weapons Convention came\r\ninto effect more than three years ago, progress has been\r\nsteady in the implementation of the Convention. The\r\nefforts made by the Secretariat of the OPCW, under the\r\nleadership of the Director-General, Mr. Bustani, have\r\ncreated an auspicious beginning for achieving a\r\ncomprehensive ban on and the elimination of chemical\r\nweapons. The universality of the Convention has been\r\nstrengthened. There are now 140 States parties and 34\r\nStates signatories to the Convention. The majority of\r\nStates parties have submitted their declarations, as\r\nstipulated in the Convention. Countries in possession\r\nof chemical weapons have destroyed large quantities of\r\nsuch weapons under the supervision of the OPCW. The\r\nOPCW has made more than 700 inspection visits to\r\nmore than 30 States parties. Other work has also been\r\nproperly undertaken.\r\nWe congratulate the OPCW on its\r\naccomplishments. We are eagerly waiting to hear the\r\nstatement to be made today by Mr. Bustani, the\r\nDirector-General of the OPCW.\r\nThe OPCW, an international organization in\r\ncharge of the prohibition and destruction of a whole\r\ncategory of weapons of mass destruction, has been\r\nplaying a very important role in promoting\r\ninternational peace and security. Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OPCW is highly important.\r\nThat cooperation will effectively promote the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the\r\nOPCW, thus enabling the latter to play an even more\r\nsignificant role in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the promotion of arms control and\r\ndisarmament.\r\nChina has always promoted the comprehensive\r\nprohibition and destruction of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including all chemical weapons. The\r\nConvention laid the foundation of international law for\r\nthe achievement of this goal. As one of the original\r\nStates parties, China has faithfully and strictly\r\nimplemented its obligations under the Convention; we\r\nwill continue to make our best efforts for the\r\nachievement of all the goals and principles of the\r\nConvention.\r\nEven though great progress has been made in\r\nimplementing the Convention, it must be noted that\r\nthere are still issues in its implementation that cannot\r\nbe ignored. Some important countries in certain regions\r\nhave not ratified the Convention. Certain countries\r\nhave expressed their reservations on the Conventions\r\nimportant and substantive articles by adopting their\r\nown national legislation. Many issues are still left\r\nunresolved after the adoption of the Convention.\r\nMore attention must continue to be paid to the\r\ndestruction and verification of abandoned chemical\r\nweapons. In accordance with the Convention, there\r\nshould be comprehensive cooperation between\r\ncountries in the chemicals trade and in exchanges of\r\nchemical technologies. We would like to take this\r\nopportunity to appeal to those countries that have not\r\nyet signed or ratified the Convention to do so at an\r\nearly date. We also hope that all of the Member States\r\nwill completely and faithfully implement their\r\nobligations under the Convention in order to achieve\r\nfully its goals.\r\nMr. Westdal (Canada): Canada is pleased that we\r\nall have a chance to discuss the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention (CWC) in this forum. This key, still young,\r\ntreaty has already contributed much to global security.\r\nIn force only since 1997, the Convention will\r\nsoon have gained the backing of 140 States, a highly\r\nsignificant achievement. Important gaps, nonetheless,\r\nremain, particularly in the Middle East, in Latin\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nAmerica and in Africa. For Canadas part, in close\r\ncooperation with the Organization of American States,\r\nwe have worked hard in Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean to promote universality. We strongly\r\nencourage all States to join.\r\nThe Convention, the first multilateral agreement\r\nto ban an entire category of weapons, includes detailed\r\nprovisions for verification. These involve national\r\nreporting or declarations concerning the use of\r\nchemicals covered by the Convention, along with on-\r\nsite inspections by the Organization for the Prohibition\r\nof Chemical Weapons. Compliance in the submission\r\nof declarations is now excellent, and hundreds of\r\ninspections have taken place. The system works.\r\nA unique feature of this Convention is that\r\nindustry is directly involved, submitting the required\r\ninformation to Governments, obtaining authorizations\r\nfor imports and exports and receiving inspections.\r\nIndustry has thus become an essential partner in\r\nfulfilling the international communitys determination\r\nthat chemicals should be used only for peaceful, non-\r\nprohibited purposes. We recognize and much\r\nappreciate this practical commitment and support for\r\nour goal.\r\nAn important obligation of the Convention is the\r\ndestruction of chemical weapon stockpiles by former\r\npossessor States. We welcome the progress already\r\nmade, and we urge all such States parties to meet the\r\ndeadline specified in the Convention. There will be\r\nmuch good reason to rejoice when such stockpiles \r\nsurely abuses of human genius and industry  are\r\nthings of the past.\r\nCanada is very supportive of the work of the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\r\nunder the leadership of Director-General Bustani. At\r\nthe same time, we recognize that several key issues\r\naffecting the organization itself, and the fully effective\r\nimplementation of the Convention, are yet to be\r\nresolved. We remain actively committed to the\r\nachievement of consensus solutions.\r\nFinally, todays debate is particularly timely,\r\ngiven the signature earlier this week of the welcomed\r\nRelationship Agreement between the OPCW and the\r\nUnited Nations. We look forward to an annual\r\nopportunity to discuss this vital Convention. But, much\r\nmore, we look forward to  and will work hard to\r\nhasten  the happy day of its universality.\r\nMs. Assumpçao-Pereira (Brazil) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We are very gratified to speak in the\r\ndiscussion on the new agenda item, Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),\r\nintroduced on the initiative of the delegation of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\nTwo days ago, the Southern Common Market\r\ncountries and Bolivia and Chile spoke in the plenary\r\nmeeting of the First Committee on the item entitled\r\nImplementation of the Convention on the Prohibition\r\nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use\r\nof Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. Our\r\ncountries highlighted the progress made in\r\nimplementing this key instrument for disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nwhich has already been ratified or acceded to by 140\r\nStates. We welcome the fraternal countries of\r\nMozambique, Gabon and Jamaica among the newest\r\nmembers of the organization. This serves to bolster the\r\nobjective of giving the Convention and the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\r\nthe desirable breadth and universality.\r\nBrazil, which played a constructive part in the\r\nnegotiations on the Relationship Agreement between\r\nOPCW and the United Nations, is very gratified by the\r\nsigning of the document on 17 October. In the context\r\nof the objectives of peace, security and development,\r\nas articulated in the Charter of this universal\r\nOrganization, the Relationship Agreement between\r\nOPCW and the United Nations represents the\r\nculmination of a process of establishing and\r\nconsolidating the non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nregime for chemical weapons, developed under the\r\nOPCWs responsibility.\r\nThe Agreement sets out to coordinate efforts and\r\nto harmonize the activities and objectives of the two\r\norganizations. This strengthens them and expands their\r\nability to act for the benefit of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\n Let us not forget that the OPCW is the product of\r\nthe work of the Conference on Disarmament. Now,\r\nwith no diminution of its autonomous, distinct\r\ncharacter, it is beginning to operate as a branch of the\r\nUnited Nations system. Thus in the matter of\r\ninternational peace and security the United Nations\r\nnow has adequate means  recognized as impartial\r\nand efficient  to act with increasing legitimacy to\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\npromote the disarmament and non-proliferation regime\r\nin this important sector of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction  chemical weapons. With regard to\r\ncooperation for development, the cooperation between\r\nthe two bodies offers promising prospects for the\r\nchemical industry and for the use of scientific and\r\ntechnical knowledge for peaceful purposes.\r\nOn his recent visit to the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, the President of\r\nBrazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, highlighted the\r\nfact that at the first OPCW conference Brazil had\r\nvolunteered one of its most talented diplomats to serve\r\nas the OPCWs first Director-General. The President\r\nsaid that Brazil understood that the renewal of the term\r\nof office of Ambassador José Maurício Bustani as the\r\nhead of the OPCW was also a sign of the recognition of\r\nthe constructive role played by Brazil in addressing\r\ninternational security issues.\r\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention and the\r\nOPCW are examples of the high level of understanding\r\nattained by the international community. But much\r\nremains to be done if we are to achieve by 2007 the\r\nobjective of destroying all existing chemical arsenals\r\nthroughout the world. Therefore, in addition to\r\ncooperation in the area of science and technology, we\r\nadvocate using the machinery of the Convention to\r\npromote the legitimacy of international controls over\r\nsensitive chemical substances. Failure to do so would\r\nbe to undermine this model disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation instrument. We are convinced that the\r\nsigning of the relationship agreement between the\r\nOPCW and the United Nations will enable us to make\r\nheadway in this direction.\r\nMr. Sood (India): India welcomes the conclusion\r\nof the relationship agreement between the United\r\nNations and the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons (OPCW). We are confident that it\r\nwill further facilitate the effective implementation of\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which has\r\nnow been in force for almost three and a half years.\r\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention is a unique\r\ndisarmament agreement. In our view, it is unique\r\nbecause it is a multilaterally negotiated disarmament\r\nagreement, the first of its kind, that is comprehensive\r\nin its scope, universal in its applicability, non-\r\ndiscriminatory in character and backed by an\r\ninternational verification system that is the first of its\r\nkind in both detail and complexity.\r\nWe are aware that the negotiation of the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention took many years, and that the\r\nnegotiations themselves  which lasted for nearly 10\r\nyears  were preceded by extensive preparations.\r\nIndia participated actively in the negotiations in the\r\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva. We were\r\nactive participants in the Preparatory Commission and\r\nwere among the original signatories. We were an\r\noriginal State party and also had the privilege to serve\r\nas the first Chairman of the Executive Council when\r\nthe Convention entered into force.\r\nOf the nearly 700 inspections that have been\r\ncarried out, more than 40 have been conducted in India\r\nby the Technical Secretariat since the Conventions\r\nentry into force. They have been conducted in a\r\nprofessional manner. The smooth conduct of such\r\ninspections  both those related to chemical weapons\r\nand those related to industry  is essential for\r\nenhancing confidence in the verification regime of the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention.\r\nThe destruction of chemical weapons and the\r\nprovision of chemical weapons destruction facilities,\r\nthe principal objective of the Convention, are\r\nproceeding well. Implementation of industry\r\nverification has been moving smoothly now that most\r\nof the significant countries have submitted their\r\nindustry declarations. Universality has improved; there\r\nare now 140 States parties to the Convention.\r\nYet there remain other areas of concern.\r\nAchieving a greater degree of universality of States\r\nparties is one area with which all States parties are\r\nconcerned. To us, given that we are also engaged in\r\nnegotiations on a protocol relating to the Biological\r\nWeapons Convention, another area of concern is the\r\nsomewhat tardy implementation of article XI of the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention. It is absolutely\r\nessential that such treaties, which are unique, for the\r\nreasons I have given, be implemented fully and\r\ncompletely, in order to ensure that they can serve as\r\nmodels; we have dealt with one category of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, so such treaties can be a model for\r\ndealing effectively with all other categories of weapons\r\nof mass destruction.\r\nMs. Martinic (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nbegin by welcoming the presence of Ambassador\r\nBustani, Director-General of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nArgentina attaches particular importance to the\r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction. In the\r\ncontext of this policy, we were an active participant in\r\nthe negotiations on the Convention on the Prohibition\r\nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use\r\nof Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. An\r\nexample of our stance was the Mendoza Declaration,\r\nadopted in 1991, by which Argentina, Brazil and Chile\r\ncommitted themselves, before the conclusion of the\r\nnegotiations, to the complete prohibition of chemical\r\nweapons. Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador\r\nhave since associated themselves with that Declaration.\r\nTherefore, Argentina salutes the work of the\r\nOPCW and of its Director-General, Ambassador\r\nBustani. We welcome the signing of the agreement\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OPCW. We have\r\nno doubt that we are moving in the right direction to\r\nrid the world of these horrendous weapons.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision\r\ntaken by the General Assembly at its 37th plenary\r\nmeeting yesterday, 19 October 2000, I now give the\r\nfloor to the Director-General of the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Mr. José\r\nBustani.\r\nMr. Bustani (Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons): I am pleased to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly on this special occasion, adding my\r\nvoice as Director-General of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to the\r\nhundreds of others that are shaping the global agenda\r\nat the dawn of a new millennium. It is a special\r\nresponsibility that requires me to speak from the heart.\r\nI would like to thank the delegation of the\r\nNetherlands, the host country of the OPCW, for its\r\ntimely initiative to request the inclusion of this\r\nadditional item on the agenda of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI am honoured, Mr. President, to speak to the\r\nUnited Nations on behalf of the OPCW in your\r\npresence, given Finlands unwavering support for the\r\nwork of the Organization. I would like, in particular, to\r\nacknowledge the active contribution of the former\r\nPresident of Finland, Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, to the quest\r\nfor the universality of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention.\r\nNumerous challenges mentioned in the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration demand not simply\r\nattention, but united, prompt and decisive action on the\r\npart of the leaders of all nations, be they large or small.\r\nAddressing these challenges also requires wisdom and\r\nvision on the part of those whom humankind has\r\nentrusted with the international coordination of such\r\nefforts. Only the dedicated symbiosis of the political\r\nwill of States with the commitment and dedication of\r\ninternational institutions can bring about the successful\r\nresolution of these burning problems.\r\nThe unprecedented gathering of world leaders in\r\nNew York last month demonstrated that the age of\r\nconfusion and doubt about the role and the functions of\r\nmultilateral mechanisms may be drawing to a close.\r\nThe turn of the millennium regenerated hope for a new\r\nera of togetherness in the international community. The\r\nworlds rapidly growing interdependence, the increased\r\ntransparency of national boundaries, the information\r\nrevolution, a shared perception of the universality of\r\nenvironmental concerns, and other factors, have\r\ncombined to produce the reality and the concept of\r\nglobalization. While the benefits of globalization must\r\nbe shared more equally, globalization itself is also\r\nevidence that it is simply no longer possible for some\r\nmatters to be dealt with by individual States or groups\r\nof States. We have entered the millennium of\r\nmultilateral solutions.\r\nOne area in which the world has to speak with\r\none voice is international security. The cold war drew\r\nto a close more than a decade ago. Yet it would be\r\nunimaginable to proclaim that the threat to world peace\r\nis now a thing of the past. In the broad spectrum of\r\nother challenges, such as global epidemics, regional\r\nconflicts, nationalist hatred, religious violence and\r\nterrorism, one of the very real dangers to human\r\nsurvival still emanates from the existence of weapons\r\nof mass destruction.\r\nIn spite of a number of well-known setbacks,\r\nhumankind can still be proud of its impressive record\r\nof achievement in curbing this danger. The total\r\nnumber of nuclear weapons is at its lowest level in 20\r\nyears. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT), which imposed real limitations on the\r\nproliferation and modernization of nuclear weapons,\r\nhas been concluded. Efforts to create an efficient\r\nverification regime for the Biological and Toxin\r\nWeapons Convention are in their final stages, although\r\ntheir end result is still uncertain.\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nNuclear weapons have traditionally dominated\r\nthe disarmament agenda. Moreover, the past decade has\r\nseen an increased awareness of the dangers of\r\nbiological warfare. Yet I would submit that, short of an\r\nArmageddon scenario, the threat to human life from\r\nchemical weapons is still probably the greatest. This is\r\nbecause, in a world which is no longer hostage to\r\nsuper-Power confrontation, chemical weapons,\r\ncompared to nuclear and biological weapons, remain\r\nthe most usable weapon of mass destruction and can be\r\nproduced with relative ease and at a relatively low cost.\r\nNevertheless, I am proud to state that, in the field\r\nof chemical disarmament, multilateral efforts have \r\nquietly but effectively  already made a real\r\ndifference and are continuing to do so. Now that the\r\nOPCW will regularly report to the General Assembly,\r\nmore will be known about our contribution to the cause\r\nof global disarmament and about the positive example\r\nwhich the OPCW provides for other present and future\r\nlegal instruments and verification regimes.\r\nThe fact that the Chemical Weapons Convention\r\nentered into force on 29 April 1997 and has been\r\nsuccessfully implemented for three and a half years is a\r\nremarkable achievement. Never before has humankind\r\nembarked on such an ambitious undertaking in the field\r\nof disarmament, aiming not just at reductions,\r\nrestrictions, confidence-building and non-proliferation,\r\nbut at the elimination of an entire category of weapons\r\nof mass destruction. The creation of the OPCW in the\r\nbeautiful city of The Hague, a well-established and\r\ngrowing international centre of admirable reputation,\r\nand of National Authorities in its member States to\r\ncoordinate and monitor the implementation of the\r\nConvention  both nationally and internationally  is\r\na unique multilateral disarmament experiment, an\r\nexperiment which has so far been a complete success.\r\nThe degree of global trust and confidence in the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention and in the OPCW is\r\nbest illustrated by the rapid and continuing increase in\r\nits membership. The OPCW has grown from 87 States\r\nparties upon entering into force to 139 today. On 1\r\nNovember, Yemen will become the 140th State party,\r\nfollowing recent similar actions taken by Gabon,\r\nJamaica and Kiribati during the Millennium Assembly.\r\nA more than 60-per-cent increase in membership in\r\nthree and a half years is without precedent in the\r\nhistory of verifiable disarmament instruments. The\r\ntrust and confidence which the international\r\ncommunity has placed in us must and will be honoured.\r\nHistorically speaking, three and a half years are a\r\nshort period. Yet in business terms, they mark the\r\nthreshold at which a sound undertaking must begin to\r\ndemonstrate its viability. Patience is undeniably a\r\nvirtue in international relations, yet patience should not\r\nbe confused with inaction. We must be patient in\r\nwaiting for results. However, we must be impatient\r\nwhen it comes to taking action.\r\nThe OPCW already has a lot to show for its three\r\nand a half years because of its forceful and impatient\r\nresolve to achieve what it was established to achieve.\r\nOne half of the 61 chemical-weapons production plants\r\ndeclared to the organization by 11 States parties have\r\nbeen either destroyed or converted for peaceful\r\npurposes. Seven per cent of the worlds declared\r\nstockpile of 70,000 tonnes of chemical agents and 15\r\nper cent of the 8.4 million chemical munitions covered\r\nby the Convention have also been destroyed. All\r\ndeclared chemical weapons have been inventoried and\r\nall declared chemical-weapons production facilities\r\nhave been inactivated. All are subject to a verification\r\nregime of unprecedented stringency. A total of 850\r\ninspections have taken place in 44 States parties since\r\nApril 1997, including 300 inspections at civilian\r\nchemical plants, to ensure that they engage only in\r\nnon-chemical-weapons-related activities. These\r\ninspections are continuing as I speak. Following the\r\nsubmission of the United States industry declaration in\r\nthe first half of this year, the United States chemical\r\nindustry is now subject to an intensive industry\r\ninspection schedule which is proceeding extremely\r\nwell and has met the full support of chemical\r\nmanufacturers and of the United States National\r\nAuthority. For an organization with a little more than\r\n500 staff members from 66 countries, including 200\r\ninspectors, and which operates on an annual budget of\r\nonly $55 million, these are impressive results.\r\nAt the same time, it would be inappropriate to use\r\nthe rostrum of the General Assembly to talk only of the\r\nOPCWs successes. It is also my responsibility as the\r\nDirector-General of the OPCW to inform the Assembly\r\nof significant challenges and obstacles to the effective\r\nand timely implementation of its mandate.\r\nThe immediate raison dêtre of the OPCW is the\r\nworldwide elimination of existing stockpiles of\r\nchemical weapons and the prevention of their re-\r\nemergence anywhere. This objective will be realized\r\nonly when all chemical weapons currently in existence\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nhave been verified as destroyed and when all countries\r\nhave joined the Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nThe biggest challenge to the Conventions\r\ncredibility comes today from the difficulties\r\nexperienced by the Russian Federation in its attempts\r\nto destroy, in accordance with the Conventions\r\ntimetables, its gigantic chemical weapons legacy\r\ninherited from the former Soviet Union. A significant\r\ndelay in the destruction of the worlds largest arsenal of\r\nchemical weapons may call into question the credibility\r\nof the Convention and could undermine the entire\r\neffort to rid the planet of these horrific weapons.\r\nRussia has already requested and received the approval\r\nof the OPCW Conference of the States Parties for a\r\ndelay in the destruction of 1 per cent of its chemical\r\nweapons, which was originally due to be completed by\r\n29 April this year. Even though the Russian Federation\r\nhas already started destroying specialized components\r\nfor chemical weapons, the actual destruction of\r\nchemical agents is scheduled to begin, at the earliest, in\r\nthe first half of next year. The first and so far only full-\r\nscale chemical-weapons destruction facility in Russia\r\nwill be commissioned even later, at the end of 2001.\r\nWhile the magnitude of the problem facing the\r\nRussian Federation is truly immense, the reality\r\nhighlights the need for further urgent and carefully\r\ncoordinated action on the part of the Russian\r\nGovernment. International assistance, the need for\r\nwhich is beyond doubt, will be provided in sufficient\r\nquantity only in the context of an updated action plan\r\nyet to be drawn up by Russia itself. There is an urgent\r\nneed for Russia to make fundamental policy decisions\r\nabout how it intends to destroy its chemical weapons\r\nstockpile at minimum cost and with adequate measures\r\nin place to protect its people and its environment. I was\r\nheartened to learn that the Russian Government just a\r\nfew days ago decided where to locate the seat of its\r\nNational Authority  the body charged with the\r\nnational implementation of the Convention. I am sure\r\nthat the new National Authority  and its dedicated\r\nDirector-General, Mr. Zinoviy Pak, charged with this\r\nresponsibility by President Putin himself  will\r\nimmediately take the much needed steps to breathe new\r\nlife into the Russian chemical weapons destruction\r\nprogramme. I wish him every success and assure him\r\nof our full support.\r\nI also welcome the steps already taken by a\r\nnumber of countries to assist Russia to destroy its\r\nchemical weapons. It is a fact, however, that the offers\r\nof such assistance fall far short of the need for them.\r\nThis highlights another element which has been absent\r\nover the past several years, namely, a mechanism for\r\nthe efficient coordination of international assistance to\r\nthe Russian Federation. My proposal to establish a\r\nsteering committee, which would regularly meet at the\r\nOPCW to monitor the progress of destruction and to\r\nidentify gaps in the Russian resources which can only\r\nbe filled from the outside, has been accepted by Russia,\r\nbut has yet to be endorsed by donor countries. I am\r\nconvinced that such a working steering committee\r\nwould help to get things moving. It might also provide\r\nthe international oversight which would allow the\r\nmajor donor  the United States  to persuade\r\nCongress to restore its funding to assist the destruction\r\nof chemical weapons in Russia.\r\nHowever, destroying chemical weapons is only\r\npart of the solution to the problem which they pose.\r\nThe Convention will not ultimately prevail until all\r\nStates have formally committed themselves to it. A\r\ntotal of 34 signatory States still have to ratify the\r\nConvention, while an additional 19 countries have yet\r\nto accede to it. I keep asking myself the same question:\r\nif the reasons for delaying accession are not\r\nbureaucratic in nature, what are they? If these reasons\r\nare unrelated to chemical weapons, then we perhaps\r\nneed to take a fresh look at the whole issue of\r\naccession.\r\nOf the utmost concern is the situation in the\r\nMiddle East, where Israel, Egypt, Syria, Libya,\r\nLebanon, the United Arab Emirates and, of course, Iraq\r\nstill remain outside the CWC. This concern is further\r\nreinforced by the spiralling cycle of violence which\r\nonce again threatens the fragile peace process, with\r\ndangerous ramifications for regional stability and\r\nsecurity and possibly for stability and security outside\r\nthat region as well. After all, it was in the Middle East\r\nthat chemical weapons were most recently used against\r\nboth combatants and civilians. Heightened tensions in\r\nthe region are calling into question the strategy which\r\ncalls for a peace settlement before other elements\r\ncontributing to such a settlement can even be\r\ndiscussed. What is wrong with taking a series of steps\r\nwhich would help to generate a climate of confidence\r\namongst the key players in that region and which\r\nwould demonstrate the genuine willingness of all\r\nparties to seek such a comprehensive settlement in\r\nparallel with peace negotiations?\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nPerhaps the time has come for all of the countries\r\nI have just mentioned to review the approaches which\r\nthey have been pursuing with regard to the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention and to the regional security\r\nagenda in general. Would the security situation in the\r\nMiddle East improve if all actors were confident that\r\nthe sword of Damocles of the possible use of chemical\r\nweapons was no longer hanging over their heads?\r\nWould not an initiative to accede to the Convention,\r\ntogether with other steps, create a political momentum\r\nin which movement on other elements of the security\r\nequation would be forthcoming?\r\nThe fact that Yemen, Jordan and Sudan have\r\nalready elected to subscribe to precisely this view\r\nindicates that such an approach is not unrealistic in the\r\nMiddle East environment. Much now depends on the\r\nnext steps to be taken by other key players. What is\r\nneeded for the gradual establishment in this region of a\r\nzone free of weapons of mass destruction, as proposed\r\nby Egypt? Would not accession to the CWC be one of\r\nthese steps, and a fundamental one at that? I\r\nwholeheartedly trust the wisdom of the Egyptian\r\nleadership on this issue.\r\nBy virtue of signing the Convention, Israel has\r\nalready, under article I, entered into an obligation, inter\r\nalia, not to develop, produce or stockpile chemical\r\nweapons. What, then, is preventing it from ratifying the\r\nConvention and codifying its political commitment in\r\nlegal terms?\r\nEqually, much depends on the active contribution\r\nof the United States and of other major Powers and\r\ngroups of States which have made the pursuit of a\r\nMiddle East peace settlement one of the cornerstones\r\nof their foreign policy. I, for one, am ready to visit the\r\nregion at an appropriate time to explore with the\r\nleadership the security issues I have mentioned.\r\nI also express the hope that the leaders of the\r\nfuture Palestinian State will not hesitate to set the\r\nrecord straight from the outset, and will accede to not\r\nmerely the Chemical Weapons Convention, but also\r\nother global arms control and disarmament treaties. A\r\npublic statement of their position in this regard would\r\ncontribute significantly to progress on this issue.\r\nAnother region of concern is Africa, where\r\nAngola, Somalia and Sao Tome and Principe remain\r\noutside the Convention, while Cape Verde, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Liberia, Madagascar, Rwanda, Sierra Leone,\r\nUganda and Zambia have yet to ratify the treaty.\r\nAfricas problems are many. However, Mozambiques\r\ndecision to accede to the Convention earlier this year\r\nproves that these very real problems are not necessarily\r\nan impediment to acceding to the CWC. This is all the\r\nmore true because the Convention does not confine\r\nitself to the issue of chemical weapons, but is also\r\nabout promoting the peaceful uses of chemistry and\r\nhelping to develop national expertise in\r\npharmaceuticals, pesticides, fertilizers etc.\r\nThis brings me to a fundamental question. What\r\nincentive would a small country have to accede to the\r\nCWC when it has neither chemical weapons nor a\r\nchemical industry to speak of? The answers to this\r\nquestion are many. While a country may not have\r\nchemical weapons, it may, in particular in some\r\nregions, be subject to an attack with chemical weapons\r\nfor as long as such weapons continue to exist. The\r\nConvention provides for assistance and protection to its\r\nStates parties in the event of such attacks. What is\r\nperhaps even more important is that it also calls, in\r\narticle XI, paragraph 2 (c) for States parties to:\r\nNot maintain among themselves any\r\nrestrictions ... which would restrict or impede\r\ntrade and the development and promotion of\r\nscientific and technological knowledge in the\r\nfield of chemistry for industrial, agricultural,\r\nresearch, medical, pharmaceutical, or other\r\npeaceful purposes.\r\nIn addition, the Convention provides for an expanding\r\nregime of restrictions in trade in chemicals applied by\r\nStates parties towards those States which have chosen\r\nto stay out. The chemicals affected by this expanding\r\nregime have an increasingly broad range of commercial\r\napplications.\r\nIn the three and a half years of its existence, the\r\nCWC has undoubtedly proven its effectiveness as a\r\nconfidence-building measure and has provided an\r\nunprecedented and much needed forum for States\r\nparties to address any concerns they may have about\r\nthe compliance of other States parties. To this end, in\r\naddition to the verification activities of the OPCW\r\nitself, a number of States parties have already made use\r\nof the various mechanisms under article IX of the\r\nConvention in relation to consultation, cooperation and\r\nfact finding. As more States accede to the CWC, and as\r\ntheir chemical producers support it, the arguments\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\noriginally advanced for the continuing maintenance of\r\nrestrictions on chemicals outside a credible, reliable\r\ninternational legal framework become increasingly\r\nredundant. Given this fact, the continuing existence of\r\nexport controls by some States parties against others is\r\nhard to understand and very difficult to justify. I\r\ntherefore urge those that still retain such controls to re-\r\nevaluate the need for them in the light of the factors I\r\nhave just outlined, with a view to removing them as\r\nsoon as possible. Moreover, restrictions other than\r\nthose agreed by the international community as a whole\r\ncould undermine the very legal pillars of any ongoing\r\nand future multilateral effort in the field of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nWhile the CWC is sometimes perceived only as a\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation treaty, it has a third\r\nand fourth pillar of equal importance. Without them,\r\nthe Convention would never have come into being.\r\nThese two pillars are assistance in the area of\r\nprotection against the use or threat of use of chemical\r\nweapons and international cooperation. The OPCW is\r\nvigorously pursuing international cooperation projects.\r\nWith the participation of the Governments of the\r\nNetherlands and the United Kingdom, we have just\r\nlaunched an innovative programme which targets\r\nscientists and engineers from developing countries. A\r\nmajor component of what we call the OPCW\r\nAssociate Programme relates to the development of\r\nthe skills and experience required to operate effectively\r\nin the context of the modern chemical industry.\r\nThe programme is supported by a number of\r\nchemical companies which are prepared to take in\r\ntrainees and to involve them in their daily activities. In\r\naddition, intensive training in aspects of chemical\r\nmanufacturing, plant safety, and the operations of\r\nchemical companies is provided at a university facility\r\nin the United Kingdom. As the programme proves its\r\nsuccess, it could be expanded  and I plan to do\r\nthat  to a regional level with individual projects for\r\nLatin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\r\nThe Convention has to remain flexible if it is to\r\nrespond adequately to new threats and challenges. It\r\nalready has a mechanism for responding to dangerous\r\nscientific and technological developments. It should\r\nalso have the capacity to provide effective instruments\r\nto cope with human threats. I am talking here of\r\nchemical terrorism. This is a global threat, and any\r\neffective cure must also be global in nature. Even\r\nbefore universality is achieved, I believe that the\r\nConvention could be made much more effective by\r\nusing its institutional and political framework to\r\nestablish greatly enhanced links and cooperation\r\nbetween national anti-terrorism agencies and disaster\r\nrelief organizations. These are, of course, suggestions\r\nwhich could be pursued further at the CWC Review\r\nConference in 2002, hopefully with the participation of\r\nthose countries that now still remain outside of the\r\nregime.\r\nTo be fully efficient and successful any\r\ninternational organization must be adequately funded. I\r\nmentioned earlier that the rapidly increasing\r\nmembership of the OPCW testifies to the international\r\ncommunitys trust and confidence that it has done a\r\ngood job, and that it will continue to do so. The\r\nOrganization must be adequately funded if it is to\r\ndeliver on the increasing demands which are being\r\nmade of it  be it in the areas of disarmament and\r\nverification, or in the field of international cooperation\r\nand assistance. Any significant widening of the gap\r\nbetween the financial resources and the Convention-\r\nmandated responsibilities of the OPCW could\r\neventually damage the credibility of the Organization\r\nand might slow down, if not reverse, its momentum\r\ntowards universality.\r\nThe relationship agreement between the OPCW\r\nand the United Nations, which was signed just a few\r\ndays ago, opens up possibilities for broad-ranging\r\ncooperation. I intend to maximize these opportunities\r\nto the fullest extent possible. Only with the active\r\nassistance of the United Nations will the OPCW be\r\nable to implement its mandate with a maximum of\r\nefficiency and transparency. The Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention is the child of the United Nations. The\r\nUnited Nations is responsible  in loco parentis —  for\r\nensuring the well-being and success of its offspring. On\r\nbehalf of the OPCW, I would also like to express my\r\ngratitude to the Office of Legal Affairs, and to\r\nMr. Hans Corell, for the support, flexibility and\r\nunderstanding which the United Nations consistently\r\ndemonstrated during these negotiations.\r\nThe OPCW has four mandates  disarmament,\r\nnon-proliferation, assistance and protection, and\r\ninternational cooperation. It will fulfil all of these\r\nmandates when it achieves universality. I hope that, as\r\nchemical weapons are destroyed, States Parties will be\r\nprepared gradually to place on the promotion of the\r\npeaceful use of chemistry at least the same emphasis\r\nand resources as are required for the maintenance of a\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nreliable non-proliferation regime. From an organization\r\ncreated to rid the world of chemical weapons, the\r\nOPCW would ultimately evolve into an organization to\r\npromote the use of chemistry for the benefit of all\r\nnations. This would be an evolution reflecting the\r\nworlds self-transformation, from confrontation and\r\ndistrust into the productive pursuit of peace and\r\nprosperity for all humankind.\r\nThe President: I thank the Director-General of\r\nthe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons.\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate of\r\nthis item for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Darwish (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation listened to the statement by Mr. Bustani, the\r\nDirector-General of the OPCW, and the unilateral view\r\nof Egypt included in the statement.\r\nWe wish to clarify certain facts regarding those\r\nparagraphs of Mr. Bustanis statement that dealt with\r\nthe situation in the Middle East.\r\nFirst, it is clear that Egypt has not acceded to the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention  although we have\r\nadhered to its provisions  because of Israels non-\r\nadherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), despite the continuous\r\ndemand for it to do so, the last time being during the\r\nSixth Review Conference of the NPT.\r\nSecondly, Egypt is ready to accede to the\r\nConvention when Israel accedes to the NPT.\r\nThirdly, Egypts position, which is crystal clear,\r\nhas been referred to in many forums. Since Mr. Bustani\r\nis aware of the facts, especially in the Middle East, he\r\nshould have reflected this in an appropriate and\r\nbalanced manner when addressing the Assembly, but\r\nunfortunately he has become accustomed to an\r\nincomplete view, which we saw last at the fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, when Egypt had to\r\nresort to the right of reply to set the record straight.\r\nFourthly, Egypt rejects chemical weapons as well\r\nas all weapons of mass destruction, as has been\r\nreflected clearly and at the highest level in President\r\nMubaraks initiative to free the Middle East of all\r\nweapons of mass destruction, I repeat, all weapons of\r\nmass destruction. Moreover, this has also been clearly\r\nreflected in the relevant resolutions put forward by\r\nEgypt in the First Committee.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to confirm that genuine\r\nwisdom requires balanced and specific treatment of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and it is important to note\r\nthat Mr. Bustanis statement has not shown that.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): First, there\r\nis a close relationship among disarmament\r\nconventions, especially those dealing with a single\r\ncategory like weapons of mass destruction.\r\nDisregarding this fact is indeed a reflection of\r\nselectivity and exacerbates the problems instead of\r\nsolving them.\r\nWe would have liked Mr. Bustanis statement to\r\nhave referred to this fact.\r\nSecondly, the international community has given\r\npriority to weapons of mass destruction, foremost\r\namong which are nuclear weapons, whose elimination\r\nis demanded in documents of the tenth special session\r\nof the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\r\nThese related to disarmament in the nuclear field.\r\nAll Arab States have acceded to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) while\r\nIsrael has not. There is a veritable sword of Damocles\r\nhanging over the States of the region and over\r\nmembers of the international community. That sword\r\ntakes the form of the nuclear weapons possessed by\r\nIsrael, namely, over 200 nuclear bombs and their means\r\nof delivery, and its policy of expansion at the expense\r\nof Arab territory. That is the real danger.\r\nIt behoves the international community to seek to\r\nimplement international agreements and United\r\nNations resolutions regarding Israels accession to the\r\nNPT, as well as Security Council resolution 487\r\n(1981). The policy of double standards is indeed futile:\r\nthose who seek real peace in the region must deal with\r\nexisting problems and realities in a comprehensive\r\nmanner.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syria) (spoke in Arabic): We\r\napologize for taking the floor at this late hour.\r\nHowever, my delegation was surprised to observe that\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nthe Director-General of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons has chosen to twist\r\nfacts and to disregard the real situation in the Middle\r\nEast in his remarks about armaments and the\r\nelimination of chemical weapons. We do not know on\r\nwhat principles Mr. Bustani bases his comments when\r\nhe attacks some countries decisions regarding\r\naccession to the Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons. Does Mr. Bustani not know that\r\ndecisions of this nature are based on the current state of\r\naffairs in various regions? Does he not know that Israel\r\nis armed to the teeth with chemical and nuclear\r\nweapons and the most advanced aircraft and tanks?\r\nMr. Bustani is misled. Indeed, he has gone in the wrong\r\ndirection in his statement. The stark reality before the\r\nGeneral Assembly is that Israel has limited itself to\r\nsigning the Convention; it has not ratified it and has\r\ntherefore not acceded to it.\r\nAddressing the General Assembly is a\r\nresponsibility that must be assumed sincerely by\r\nrepresentatives of international organizations. We do\r\nnot believe Mr. Bustani has taken that approach. His\r\nstatement was merely a simplistic analysis of the\r\noverall political situation in the Middle East and was in\r\nno way a reflection of the actual facts nor of the\r\npositions of the States parties to the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. In fact, if his\r\nstatement illustrates anything it is that Mr. Bustani is\r\ncompletely ignorant of the situation in the Middle East.\r\nHe has adopted a selective policy in making his\r\nstatement. According to Mr. Bustanis assertions, 34\r\ncountries have not ratified the Convention, while 19\r\nStates have yet to accede to it. This raises questions in\r\nour minds and indicates that the Director-General of\r\nthe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons should make additional efforts throughout the\r\nworld, rather than focus on a single region. It is true\r\nthat the situation in the Middle East is complex, but we\r\nshould identify the source of the problem rather than\r\naddress the situation in a suspicious way.\r\nThe one party responsible for dragging the\r\nMiddle East into a spiral of violence is Israel. Mr.\r\nBustani used silk gloves in describing the situation and\r\nIsraels position, although he knows quite well that\r\nIsrael has not genuinely adopted any practical, political\r\nor legal measures with regard to the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. His statement does\r\nnot differ from Israels statements or the positions it\r\nhas taken. His statement reflects a complete bias in\r\nfavour of Israels attitude. It does not behove an\r\ninternational official to mislead the international\r\ncommunity in such a way.\r\nThe undeniable truth known to everyone is that\r\nIsrael alone is responsible for the escalation of the arms\r\nrace in the Middle East. Israel publicly refuses to\r\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. In fact, it is the only country in the\r\nregion that has, under flimsy pretexts, not acceded to\r\nthe NPT  to say nothing of other important\r\nconventions.\r\nIt is the Arabs who need reassurance and security.\r\nTheir land is under occupation, and Israeli armed\r\nforces threaten them with nuclear and chemical\r\nweapons and all sorts of internationally prohibited\r\narms  weapons that Israel has used against Lebanon\r\nand Palestine, among other places. What the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\r\nshould do is to deal with the issues on the basis of\r\nfacts, and not on the basis of its Director-Generals\r\nmisguided accusations levelled at the wrong parties in\r\ntotal disregard of his role. That role is to prohibit all\r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East,\r\nstarting with nuclear weapons.\r\nMr. Lancry (Israel): I would first like to begin\r\nmy short statement by thanking the Director-General of\r\nthe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons for his statement. Israel views the unique\r\nChemical Weapons Convention  which has given\r\nglobal security a significant objective, namely, the total\r\nelimination of chemical weapons  as a very\r\nimportant Convention. However, I am surprised that\r\nsome of the representatives here have chosen to try to\r\nderide the topic under discussion and to deal with\r\nissues that are not at all part of the debate in this\r\nmeeting.\r\nOur Foreign Minister, Mr. Shimon Peres, stated\r\nwhen Israel signed the Convention, in 1993, that there\r\nis no weapon against weapons of mass destruction,\r\nonly political determination. The fact that Israeli\r\ncitizens are obliged to be equipped with chemical-\r\nweapon-protection gear is itself proof of the degree of\r\nthreat to our citizens, in particular of the threat from\r\ncountries in the region that are notorious for their use\r\nand possession of chemical weapons.\r\nIt is not a coincidence that the two countries that\r\nhave questioned the procedures for convening this\r\nmeeting did not on the other hand even question the\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nprocedure for convening the tenth emergency special\r\nsession. One might suspect that those objections\r\nemanate from a well-known position of Syria and\r\nEgypt, which has been reflected in their reluctance\r\neven to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention as they\r\ncontinue to possess those weapons.\r\nIsrael signed the Chemical Weapons Convention\r\nin January 1993, and is obligated under international\r\nlaw to the moral principle of global chemical\r\ndisarmament. At the signature ceremony, Israel\r\nexpressed its hope that other countries in the region\r\nwould follow suit; the reality, unfortunately, is in stark\r\ncontrast to that. These circumstances certainly pose\r\ndifficulties in terms of taking the decision whether to\r\nratify the Convention or not. Israel hopes that the\r\nenvironment in the Middle East, in which hostility and\r\nnon-recognition are still prevalent, will change soon in\r\na manner that will enable Israel to take the decision to\r\nratify the Convention.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): My delegation listened carefully to the\r\nstatement by Mr. Bustani, Director-General of the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,\r\nand I took special note of what he said about the\r\nsituation in the Middle East; he said that Libya was\r\namong several States in the region that had not yet\r\nacceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Let me\r\nstress that my country is now a party to most\r\ninternational disarmament conventions, including the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT), because Libya wishes to participate in\r\ninternational efforts to put an end to the production of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. My country has made\r\nclear in all international forums the reason why Libya\r\nhas yet to join the Chemical Weapons Convention: the\r\nsecurity imbalance in the Middle East resulting from\r\nthe fact that Israel possesses hundreds of nuclear\r\nwarheads and has to date refused, in spite of constant\r\ninternational appeals, to accede to the NPT or to place\r\nits nuclear installations under the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system.\r\nMr. Bustani addressed only part of the situation in\r\nthe Middle East when he named several States and\r\nindicated that they were still outside the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. But he ought to\r\nhave mentioned the reasons why those States have not\r\nyet adhered to the Convention. He is well acquainted\r\nwith those reasons, because those States  including,\r\nas I have said, Libya  have explained why they have\r\nnot acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. We\r\nhave explained this in the General Assembly and in\r\nother international forums, and we might have hoped\r\nthat Mr. Bustani would have mentioned the true\r\nreasons for those States not having acceded to the\r\nConvention.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I wish to respond to the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of Israel a moment ago. After listening\r\nto his statement, everyone can see clearly that Israel\r\ndoes indeed possess chemical weapons and that it\r\nconsiders the possession and stockpiling of such\r\nweapons to be a means of providing security for its\r\ncitizens. If every State in the world followed that\r\nobviously unacceptable Israeli logic, there would be no\r\ninternational conventions on the prohibition of\r\nchemical, biological or nuclear weapons, because every\r\ncountry would offer the excuse that it had to protect the\r\nsafety and security of its citizens.\r\nThis proves again that the Arabs are the Middle\r\nEastern parties that actually need security and safety.\r\nThe Arabs do not possess nuclear weapons with which\r\nto defend themselves; nor do they possess other\r\ncategories of weapons that can counter the challenges\r\nlaid down by Israel as it occupies Arab lands and\r\nsuppresses Arab citizens in those occupied territories.\r\nI was surprised to hear the Israeli representatives\r\nfantastical comparison when two delegations objected\r\nto the procedures used to consider the item before us,\r\nand to the content of the statement of the Director-\r\nGeneral of the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons: how could he compare this to the\r\nemergency special session on the massacres inflicted\r\non the Palestinian people? That reflects Israels\r\naggressive nature and its defiance of the international\r\ncommunity. In fact, convening an emergency special\r\nsession was the minimum we could do to put an end to\r\nthe massacres inflicted upon the Palestinian people.\r\nOnce more, we come back to one constant fact:\r\nthere can be no peace in the Middle East without a\r\ncommitment by Israel to the resolutions adopted by the\r\ninternational community, and without Israels\r\nwithdrawal from all the occupied territories to the\r\nborders of 4 June 1967. Israel must give up its dream\r\nof dominating the region by threatening to use or using\r\nweapons of mass destruction. The international\r\ncommunity bears primary responsibility to pressure\r\nIsrael to take genuine action to achieve a just, lasting\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.38\r\nand comprehensive peace in the Middle East and to\r\nenable us all to work towards the establishment of a\r\nzone free of all weapons of mass destruction,\r\nespecially nuclear weapons and chemical weapons.\r\nMr. Darwish (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nrepresentative of Israel criticized Egypts observation\r\non the need to abide by the rules of procedure of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. He linked that with the Assemblys\r\ndecision to resume the tenth emergency special session.\r\nWe wonder about the connection between the two\r\nissues. The resumption by the General Assembly of the\r\ntenth emergency special session is a matter that has\r\nbeen decided upon, and the debate on this vital and\r\nimportant issue will resume this afternoon.\r\nMr. Itzchaki (Israel): I am sorry that I have to\r\nspeak once again in exercise of the right of reply. I\r\npromise to be very brief.\r\nI listened to the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic in exercise\r\nof the right of reply, and I fail to understand the logic\r\nbehind his words. The fact that Israeli citizens are\r\nobliged to be equipped with safety gear to protect\r\nthemselves from chemical weapons does not indicate\r\nanything whatsoever about Israels capabilities of any\r\nkind. The fact is that Israeli citizens were, and still are,\r\nunder the threat of chemical weapons, inter alia, from\r\ncountries like his own.\r\nThe second point I wish to raise is that I would\r\nask the Syrian representative, and even recommend to\r\nhim, that he not lecture us about massacres and that he\r\nshould not speak on behalf of the Palestinians. These\r\nissues are rather serious and are under consideration\r\nbetween us and the Palestinians. Nobody gave the\r\nSyrian representative a mandate to represent the\r\nPalestinians here, especially given his countrys record\r\nof massacres in this regard, which I would rather not\r\nmention in this forum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.45 p.m.\r\n"
