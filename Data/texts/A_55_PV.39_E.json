(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 29\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/55/98)\r\nMrs. Ferrero-Waldner (Austria): I am truly\r\nhonoured to have the opportunity today to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly in my capacity as current\r\nChairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). At the outset, I\r\nshould like to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport, which gives an impressive account of the broad\r\nscope of the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nThe United Nations is one of the closest partners\r\nof the OSCE in our common efforts for “freedom from\r\nfear”, to take that very vivid notion from the\r\nMillennium report of the Secretary-General. This\r\nspecial partnership is also reflected in the status of the\r\nOSCE as a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nOne of our objectives during our chairmanship is\r\nto further strengthen cooperation with our partner\r\norganizations, in particular the United Nations. It goes\r\nwithout saying that no institution or country on its own\r\nis able to combat effectively the threats to security and\r\nstability in our region, which have become more\r\ndiverse and complex since the end of the cold war. The\r\nOSCE has always seen itself as an integral part of a\r\nweb of interlocking institutions which deal with\r\nsecurity, human rights and economic issues in the\r\nOSCE area.\r\nThe call for enhanced cooperation and\r\ncoordination for a pragmatic division of labour which\r\ndraws on the respective strengths of the various actors\r\nmight belong to the standard repertoire of multilateral\r\ndiplomacy. But this does not change its relevance: we\r\nmust avoid needless competition between institutions\r\nand ensure the efficient use of resources. We, the\r\nMember States, bear particular responsibility in this\r\nrespect.\r\nThe OSCE has responded to this challenge by\r\ndeveloping the Platform for Cooperative Security as a\r\nframework for cooperation between the OSCE and its\r\ninternational partners. This was adopted at the OSCE\r\nSummit in Istanbul in November 1999 as part of the\r\nCharter on European Security. The goal of the Platform\r\nis to strengthen the mutually reinforcing nature of the\r\nrelationship between those organizations and\r\ninstitutions concerned with the promotion of\r\ncomprehensive security in the OSCE area.\r\nI would like to share the conclusion of the\r\nSecretary-General, as expressed in his report\r\n(A/55/98), that the cooperation between the OSCE and\r\nthe United Nations has continued to prosper over\r\nrecent years. This is particularly true at the level of\r\nwork in the field, which is playing an ever greater role\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nin the work of the OSCE. In Kosovo, where the OSCE\r\nacts as one of the distinct pillars of the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo, I can even\r\nsee a new quality in the relations between our two\r\norganizations. Given the multitude and diversity of\r\ntasks and the very difficult environment, this\r\ncooperation has so far fared quite well.\r\nThis year is a very special one for our\r\norganization. We celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary\r\nof the signing of the Helsinki Final Act. This document\r\nnot only constituted a breakthrough in East-West\r\nrelations during the cold war but also initiated the\r\nHelsinki process, which still holds very valid lessons\r\nfor our common efforts for peace and stability. Helsinki\r\naimed at achieving security and stability through\r\ncooperation, and took a broad and comprehensive view\r\nof security. I see the most lasting legacy, however, in\r\nthe recognition of the close link between better\r\nrelations among States and respect for human rights\r\nwithin them.\r\nThe Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE) underwent a fundamental change and\r\nevolved into the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe. The key role of democracy and\r\nhuman rights and strong and self-confident civil\r\nsocieties in the efforts of the organization for peace and\r\nstability in Europe has, however, remained unchanged.\r\nThis was confirmed in the Charter on European\r\nSecurity. Participating States are not only responsible\r\nto each other for the implementation of OSCE\r\ncommitments but also accountable to their citizens.\r\nThe CSCE, and now the OSCE, has proved to be\r\na very flexible instrument and adjusted itself to\r\nfar-reaching changes in the security landscape of\r\nEurope after the fall of the Iron Curtain. By evolving\r\ninto a field organization with a network of 20 missions\r\nand other field operations, the OSCE has adapted itself\r\nto an environment in which security and stability are\r\nmore and more threatened by developments within\r\nStates than by aggressive postures between States.\r\nPoverty, ethnic conflict, serious violations of human\r\nand minority rights, resource depletion and\r\nenvironmental degradation are often the long-term\r\ncauses of violent conflict which transcend the scope of\r\nthe mainly military instruments of classical security\r\npolicy.\r\nUltimately, the success of the OSCE will be\r\nmeasured by its contribution to the improvement of the\r\nlives of the people in our countries and its response to\r\ntheir needs and hopes and, thus, by its ability to\r\neffectively address the various conflicts and crises\r\nthroughout the OSCE area. Let me therefore turn to the\r\nspecific challenges for the OSCE in the prevention,\r\nsettlement and management of conflicts.\r\nThere is a continuing focus on South-Eastern\r\nEurope. History has very clearly shown that there is no\r\nsecurity in Europe as long as there is instability in this\r\npart of our continent. The truly historic developments\r\nin the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have brought us\r\nsomewhat closer to a common Europe, wholly at peace\r\nand fully free. The Serbian people made it clear that\r\nthey want to live in a democratic country which is\r\nfinally at peace with its neighbours.\r\nWe all hope that the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, under the new democratic leadership, will\r\nsoon become an integral part of the international\r\ncommunity. As Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE, I\r\nwill support the integration of the country into\r\ninternational bodies. I would very much welcome a\r\nformal request by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nfor membership in the OSCE as soon as possible.\r\nThe democratic change should help the work of\r\nthe OSCE in this region, which is mainly devoted to\r\npeace-building, and particularly to the fostering of\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law and civil societies. Free and\r\nfair elections play a key role in this context. The OSCE\r\nis tasked, among others, with the organization of the\r\nlocal elections in Kosovo this Saturday and, two weeks\r\nlater, of the general elections in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nIn Kosovo the OSCE has been engaged, together\r\nwith the United Nations, in the very difficult task of\r\ncivil and voter registration, which resulted in more than\r\none million registrations and, on the whole, proceeded\r\nquite well. I regret very much, however, that the\r\nKosovo Serbs did not participate in this exercise and\r\nthat the former regime in Belgrade did not allow\r\nregistration in Serbia. We will certainly not cease our\r\nefforts to bring about active participation of the\r\nKosovo Serbs in political life, since otherwise our\r\ncommon goal of maintaining the multi-ethnic character\r\nof Kosovo would no longer seem realistic. This will\r\nalso depend on a significant improvement of the\r\ninternal security situation. The police school run by the\r\nOSCE is contributing to this aim through the\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nestablishment of a professionally trained, multi-ethnic\r\npolice force.\r\nThis year has seen encouraging developments in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina too, where the OSCE also\r\ncooperates closely with the United Nations. The\r\ncommunal elections organized by the OSCE\r\ncontributed to greater pluralism and less ethnocentrism\r\nin the political landscape. I very much hope that the\r\nforthcoming general elections will further foster these\r\ndevelopments. The growing number of minority\r\nreturns, which hopefully will be sustained and further\r\nspeeded up, reflects these positive trends.\r\nOne of the main principles of our chairmanship is\r\nto give equal attention and treatment to conflicts and\r\npotential risks to security, irrespective of their\r\ngeographical location, and not to lose sight of our\r\npronounced aim to create a common security space.\r\nThe conflict in the northern Caucasus reminds us that\r\nwe still have a long way to go in realizing a new era of\r\ndemocracy, peace and unity for all people in the OSCE\r\narea. These goals were solemnly proclaimed by heads\r\nof State and Government 10 years ago in the Charter of\r\nParis for a New Europe. I am convinced that the OSCE\r\ncan make a very positive contribution to the alleviation\r\nof the suffering of the civilian population, as well as to\r\nthe search for the political dialogue which I see as\r\nindispensable for ensuring lasting peace and stability in\r\nthis region. But this requires the return of the OSCE to\r\nthe region. We have obtained the principled assurance\r\nfrom the Russian side for such a return. We expect that\r\nthe specific talks on the technical and organizational\r\ndetails, and in particular on the questions of security,\r\nwill very soon be concluded successfully.\r\nOf particular concern to our chairmanship are the\r\nso-called “frozen conflicts” in the southern Caucasus\r\nand in Moldova, conflicts that are often overshadowed\r\nby other crises in the OSCE region. Indeed, we can\r\nregister some progress in the settlement of the conflict\r\nconcerning the Tshinvali region in South Ossetia,\r\nGeorgia. The constructive discussion on status-related\r\nissues at a meeting with experts from the region in\r\nBaden, Austria, last July gave new impetus to the peace\r\nnegotiations. We are now trying to ensure that this\r\nso-called “Baden process” will keep its dynamism.\r\nWith regard to Abkhazia, Georgia, our aim\r\nremains to help create conditions for the safe and\r\nsmooth return of refugees to the Gali region, again in\r\nclose cooperation with the United Nations, which has\r\nthe leading role in the settlement of this conflict. I\r\nbelieve that a joint evaluation on the ground and on the\r\nopening of a United Nations human rights office with\r\nOSCE participation in Gali — hopefully under\r\nimproved security conditions — would be very helpful\r\nin this respect.\r\nWe hope that the negotiations, which we hope\r\nwill take place at the end of this month, will lead to\r\nprogress towards a final settlement of the future status\r\nof the Trans-Dniestrian region which respects the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Moldova. We\r\nexpect the first steps, with regard to the withdrawal of\r\nRussian military equipment, to start very soon, so as to\r\nensure the fulfilment of the respective Istanbul\r\ncommitment by the Russian Federation.\r\nAs to Georgia, let me mention one very\r\nsuccessful activity of the OSCE. We often speak — and\r\nrightly so — of the promotion of a culture of conflict\r\nprevention. A good example for such a preventive\r\napproach is, in my view, the observation mission of the\r\nOSCE at the border between Georgia and the Chechen\r\nRepublic of the Russian Federation.\r\nAlso in Central Asia, the work of the OSCE is\r\nfocusing on conflict prevention. During my several\r\nvisits to the region, the most recent being only last\r\nweek, and in my talks to the Presidents of the five\r\nStates, I got a first-hand account of the security\r\nproblems. Terrorism and violent extremism, organized\r\ncrime and illegal arms and drug trafficking, resource\r\ndepletion, especially freshwater scarcities, and\r\nenvironmental problems, but also the precarious\r\nsituation in Afghanistan, endanger the situation and\r\nstability in the whole region.\r\nIn view of our target to achieve comprehensive\r\nsecurity throughout the OSCE area, we have continued\r\nour efforts to increase OSCE cooperation with the\r\nCentral Asian participating States. The primary role of\r\nthe OSCE is that of a political platform supporting the\r\nefforts of other specialized international actors,\r\nincluding those from the United Nations family. So, for\r\ninstance, just last week in Tashkent, together with the\r\nUnited Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime\r\nPrevention, we held an international conference on the\r\nissues of drug trafficking, organized crime and\r\nterrorism. I hope that this event was able to raise\r\ninternational awareness of these threats to security and\r\nstability, to contribute to the strengthening of regional\r\ncooperation among the Central Asian participating\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nStates and to enhance cooperation and coordination\r\namong the international actors active in the region.\r\nI have already underlined the key importance of\r\nthe human dimension in the work of the OSCE.\r\nConflicts in the last decade were mainly internal and\r\ntook a heavy toll on the civilian population, women\r\nand children in particular. We have, therefore, put a\r\nspecific focus on problems related to human security,\r\nsuch as children in armed conflict, the unchecked\r\nproliferation of small arms, and trafficking in human\r\nbeings, in particular of women and girls. Paying greater\r\nattention to these abhorrent facts of civil unrest in the\r\nwork of the OSCE is the logical consequence of an\r\napproach that sees the ultimate aim of all the efforts in\r\nthe improvement of the security of the individual, an\r\nunderstanding of security which was confirmed in the\r\nIstanbul Summit Declaration.\r\nEconomic and environmental issues are of\r\nconsiderable relevance in pursuing an effective and\r\nbroad approach to security policy. We have, therefore,\r\naimed at ensuring a stronger, action-oriented role of the\r\nOSCE in this dimension also. The eighth OSCE\r\nEconomic Forum in Prague in mid-April was indeed\r\ndevoted to the task of post-conflict rehabilitation. In\r\npreparing and organizing the Forum we tried a new\r\nand, I think, successful approach, in placing greater\r\nemphasis on the OSCE’s practical work in the field. We\r\nhave also pursued the goal of enhanced cooperation\r\nbetween the OSCE and the Economic Commission for\r\nEurope (ECE). To this end the Executive Secretary of\r\nthe ECE was invited for the first time to address the\r\nPermanent Council of the OSCE.\r\nLet me also report on one more measure which\r\nshould enable the OSCE to respond faster and more\r\nefficiently to civilian crises. The Rapid Expert\r\nAssistance and Cooperation Teams — the so-called\r\nREACT programme — should allow highly trained\r\ncivilian experts in the areas of policing,\r\ndemocratization and elections to be deployed to the\r\nfield more quickly. This would be achieved through\r\ngreater coherence in the training programmes and\r\nrecruitment procedures of the participating States. I am\r\nvery glad that the Deputy Secretary-General, Ms.\r\nFréchette, has accepted our invitation to attend the\r\nforthcoming OSCE Ministerial Council and to speak\r\nabout the experiences of the United Nations in this\r\nfield, also in view of the recent Brahimi report.\r\nThe Ministerial Council of the OSCE, which will\r\ntake place at the end of November in Vienna, should\r\nprovide us with the opportunity both to take stock of\r\nthe contribution of the Organization to peace and\r\nstability in the OSCE area, following the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, and to set\r\nguideposts for its future work. We will have to evaluate\r\nthe progress made since the Istanbul Summit and the\r\ncontribution of the OSCE to peace-building and\r\nconflict prevention. In addition, new threats to security\r\nand the responses required of a security organization\r\nlike the OSCE should be assessed. We would like to\r\nsee this Ministerial Council give the political impetus\r\nto an enhanced focus — also within the framework of\r\nthe OSCE — to the above-mentioned human security\r\nissues.\r\nThe OSCE and the United Nations are natural\r\npartners in their common efforts for peace, democracy\r\nand prosperity. We will continue to further strengthen\r\nthis close partnership. An effective contribution of the\r\nOSCE to security and stability in this region is also in\r\nthe very interest of the United Nations. This should\r\nfree up United Nations resources for conflict\r\nprevention and crisis management in parts of the world\r\nwith less developed security arrangements.\r\nMr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\nBelarus delegation welcomes Ms. Benita Ferrero-\r\nWaldner, Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to the\r\nGeneral Assembly as we take up the item on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus attaches special\r\nimportance to the relationship between the United\r\nNations and the major regional organizations. We are\r\nguided by the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations as we approach today’s\r\ndiscussion. In our view, the OSCE remains a unique,\r\npan-European forum that reflects the interests and\r\naspirations of all States on the continent.\r\nThe activities of the OSCE last year were\r\ndetermined to a large extent by decisions taken at the\r\nOSCE’s Istanbul Summit in November 1999 and by the\r\nmajor documents adopted there. For all practical\r\npurposes, these documents define the principles of the\r\nindivisibility of European security and its integration\r\ninto a global security system. In our view, an analysis\r\nof the provisions of the Charter on European Security\r\nthat was adopted last year in Istanbul and of the\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nMillennium Declaration further confirms that there is a\r\nsingle framework for relations between the OSCE and\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nOne important activity of the two organizations\r\ncontinues to be the elaboration and implementation of\r\nan early warning mechanism to avert and settle\r\nconflicts. The OSCE activities in Kosovo that are being\r\ncarried out within the context of Security Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999) remain a real test for the OSCE\r\nand its member States. We believe that, at the present\r\nstage — taking account of the democratic changes in\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia — it is once again\r\nnecessary to seriously assess the consequences of any\r\nactions relating to the holding of municipal elections in\r\nKosovo. In our view, we must not rush or take hasty\r\ndecisions that, given the present security situation in\r\nKosovo, could permanently undermine belief in the\r\nability of the OSCE and of the international community\r\nas a whole to act in keeping with generally accepted\r\ndemocratic principles and values. A decision on the\r\nholding of elections must be taken on the basis of\r\nintensive consultations with Belgrade and take into\r\naccount the views of all the parties that have an interest\r\nin the future status of Kosovo.\r\nThis year Belarus and the OSCE worked together\r\nparticularly on the preparation for and holding of\r\nparliamentary elections for the representatives to our\r\ncountry’s National Assembly. Throughout virtually all\r\nof last year the central electoral commission of the\r\nRepublic of Belarus, the National Assembly and all the\r\nsocial and political forces in our country were actively\r\ninvolved in discussions with the OSCE consultative\r\nobserver mission in Minsk. The result of this work was\r\nthe preparation of a document unprecedented in the 10\r\nyears of Belarusian democracy and statehood: the\r\nelectoral code of the Republic of Belarus. This code\r\ntook account of virtually all of the key demands of\r\nexperts from the main international and regional\r\norganizations, including the OSCE. In particular,\r\nprovisions were introduced governing early access of\r\ncandidates to the media, the status of international\r\nelectoral observers, limiting the duration of advance\r\nvoting, abolishing the prosecution of persons who call\r\nfor the boycott of elections and a number of other\r\nimportant changes. The Council of Europe’s Venice\r\nCommission for Democracy through Law gave a\r\npositive assessment of the document that was adopted.\r\nJust before the elections it was agreed to have the\r\nelections evaluated and observed by the OSCE’s\r\ntechnical assessment mission, the OSCE’s Office for\r\nDemocratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)\r\nand representatives from the European Parliament\r\ntroika. Unfortunately, despite the constructive attitude\r\nleading up to the elections, these experts and\r\nrepresentatives issued a number of negative\r\nassessments regarding the elections themselves. These\r\nconclusions were based above all on the views of the\r\nODIHR and did not take into account the conclusions\r\nof the many independent international observers, from\r\n28 countries, who had also participated in observing\r\nthe elections. These conclusions were issued against\r\nthe backdrop of a United States Department of State\r\nannouncement — issued well before the holding of the\r\nelections — that it was not going to recognize the\r\nresults.\r\nIn our opinion, this was virtually tantamount to\r\nignoring the democratic will of millions of Belarusians\r\nas clearly expressed during the fair and free elections.\r\nHowever, in accordance with our electoral code, on 29\r\nOctober the second round of elections will take place.\r\nWe have had a positive experience working extensively\r\nwith the OSCE consultative observer mission in Minsk,\r\nand we express the hope that, in the final analysis, at\r\nthe end of the elections the OSCE will issue an\r\nobjective assessment of the electoral process in\r\nBelarus. Attempts to not recognize the outcome of\r\nelections in Belarus and to revive the former Supreme\r\nSoviet — which by its own decision ceased functioning\r\non 27 November 1996 — would be simply\r\nincomprehensible.\r\nA legitimate and truly active parliament — a\r\nnational assembly — is needed not only by the people\r\nof Belarus, but also by the entire international\r\ncommunity, since only a real parliament — and not a\r\nshadow of the past — can ratify international\r\nagreements and treaties, including those of great\r\nimportance to the United Nations in the fields of\r\nsecurity, disarmament and human rights.\r\nDemocracy is still the single main choice for the\r\npeople of Belarus. Belarus hopes for a very\r\nconstructive approach in the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE to the Belarusian people’s implementing their\r\nage-old right to exercise democratic choice. It is only\r\nin that way that the important principles linking the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, found in the United\r\nNations Charter and the most important documents of\r\nthe OSCE, can be truly effective.\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nMr. imonović (Croatia): My country welcomes\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe” and is particularly\r\npleased to note that the scope of interrelated activities\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) seems to be ever-\r\nbroadening. We also welcome that same spirit\r\ncontained in the statement by the OSCE Chairman-in-\r\nOffice, Her Excellency Mrs. Benita Ferrero-Waldner.\r\nCroatia regards cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional security organizations as an\r\nessential part of the ongoing process to stimulate and\r\nconsolidate peacekeeping and peace-building\r\ninitiatives. This could be achieved through assistance\r\nin conflict management and the building of post-\r\nconflict societies, as well as initiatives toward building\r\ndemocratic processes and sustainable development. In\r\nthis context, Croatia welcomes the efforts by the OSCE\r\nto promote conflict prevention, strengthening of\r\ndemocratic institutions and monitoring of the respect\r\nfor human and minority rights, in line with the\r\nconclusions contained in the Lisbon Summit\r\nDeclaration and confirmed at the Istanbul Summit.\r\nAs an active member of the OSCE, Croatia has\r\ncontributed and shall continue to contribute to these\r\nefforts. My country has closely cooperated with and\r\nsupported OSCE activities in a variety of fields in\r\nCroatia. Croatia appreciates all the work that has been\r\ndone by the OSCE Mission to Croatia and would like\r\nto use this opportunity to thank once again the\r\ninternational police monitors who are performing their\r\nduties in the Danubian region alongside Croatian\r\nnational police officers. They will terminate their\r\nactivities as a separate body within the OSCE Mission\r\non 31 October 2000, thus proving that the process of\r\nreconciliation and the establishment of trust between\r\nthe two communities in that war-torn part of Croatia is\r\nprogressing well. We also consider this as another step\r\ntoward the final conclusion of the OSCE mandate in\r\nCroatia.\r\nCroatia supports the ongoing efforts of the OSCE\r\nto promote democratic values and to lay down the\r\nfoundations for self-sustainable societies in\r\nneighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the efforts of the OSCE in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, in coordination with the\r\nUnited Nations, aimed at helping to facilitate police\r\nand judicial reform, as well as to monitor compliance\r\nwith media standards, as mandated by the Dayton\r\nAccords. In helping to organize elections in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, it is very important to keep the balance\r\nbetween the individual rights of citizens on the one\r\nhand and the collective rights of the three constituent\r\nnations on the other, and in this regard to respect the\r\nconstitution. We believe that the new political\r\nenvironment in the region will also have a positive\r\ninfluence on the efforts of the OSCE in that country.\r\nWe welcome the restructuring of the OSCE\r\nSecretariat in order to attain better value from the\r\nservices that it provides to its participating States and\r\nto enhance its response capabilities to emerging crises.\r\nIn this context, Croatia supports the strengthening of\r\nOSCE operational capabilities through the creation of\r\nRapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams to\r\nenable faster deployment of experts for traditional\r\nOSCE tasks, such as conflict prevention, crisis\r\nmanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation, and also\r\nby creating a new operations centre to further improve\r\nthe effectiveness of the OSCE and facilitate new\r\nprogrammes.\r\nCroatia assigns great importance to the\r\nprevention of the recurrence of armed conflicts. This\r\nphenomenon remains closely linked both to unresolved\r\nissues regarding the cause of conflict, as well as to\r\ninadequate or missing programmes for post-conflict\r\npeace-building. The commitment of the international\r\ncommunity, and here I speak primarily of regional\r\norganizations such as the OSCE, must be coordinated\r\nand sustained over time, thereby addressing the\r\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems,\r\nwhich, if left unattended, can ignite or re-ignite a\r\nconflict. The Croatian case may be a good example.\r\nThe peacekeeping job done by the United Nations,\r\nwhich led to cessation of hostilities and a peace\r\nagreement, was taken over by the OSCE. Moreover,\r\nanother process, the Stability Pact, has been established\r\nwith the aim of creating long-lasting stability in the\r\nregion. My country, as an active participant in this\r\nprocess, will continue to support the activities of the\r\nStability Pact.\r\nI would like to use this opportunity to welcome\r\nthe recent invitations to the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, extended by Her Excellency Benita\r\nFerrero-Waldner, acting as the OSCE Chairperson, as\r\nwell as by the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nHis Excellency Kofi Annan, to apply for membership\r\nto the OSCE and the United Nations respectively.\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nMembership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in\r\nthese organizations will benefit the prospects for\r\nstability in the region, especially if the OSCE re-\r\nestablishes its Mission to the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia. Any Yugoslav application should proceed\r\nfrom the internationally accepted position that the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia is one of five equal\r\nsuccessor States to the former Socialist Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and should consequently be\r\ndrafted in a manner consistent with the invitations\r\nextended to it.\r\nBefore closing, allow me to express my sincere\r\ngratitude to Austria, which is currently chairing the\r\nOSCE, for all the efforts made and for all the\r\ndiplomatic skills shown while working to secure the\r\nefficient and fruitful functioning of the OSCE. Its\r\nperformance can be compared to the performance of\r\nthe Vienna Symphony Orchestra that we admired\r\nyesterday.\r\nMr. Brattskar (Norway): One important aspect\r\nof the evolving relationship between the United\r\nNations and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is the pattern of\r\ncooperation and coordination in the field. Field\r\ncooperation has now been established in many of the\r\nareas of conflict and instability in the OSCE region,\r\nincluding the Balkans, the Caucasus and Central Asia.\r\nGenerally speaking, cooperation in the field functions\r\nwell.\r\nRecently we have seen greatly increased practical\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE\r\nin Kosovo. Within the framework of the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, the\r\nOSCE has responsibility for institution building and\r\ndemocratization, fields that are within the core\r\nactivities of the OSCE. Such a division of labour, based\r\non the comparative advantages of each organization,\r\nensures that the limited resources are used in the most\r\ncost-effective way. The development of a police force\r\nin Kosovo, in which the United Nations is running the\r\noperational part and the OSCE the educational part, as\r\nwell as the United Nations-OSCE cooperation on the\r\nupcoming OSCE-led municipal elections in Kosovo,\r\nare concrete examples of this.\r\nSimilar cooperative arrangements based on\r\ndivision of responsibility have been established both in\r\nBosnia and Croatia and in several parts of the former\r\nSoviet Union, particularly the Transcaucasus, where\r\nthe United Nations and the OSCE alternately play the\r\nleading and supporting roles. This is particularly\r\nevident in Georgia, where the division of labour is\r\ngeographical. In the Abkhazia region of Georgia the\r\nUnited Nations is playing the leading role in the efforts\r\nto resolve the conflict, with the OSCE in a supporting\r\nrole. In South Ossetia the OSCE has taken the lead in\r\nefforts to resolve the conflict, while the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme implements programmes that\r\nbenefit both communities and the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees facilitates\r\nthe return of refugees and displaced persons. The\r\nactivities of these two agencies contribute directly to\r\nbuilding confidence and promoting development as\r\nbuilding blocks in a permanent solution to the\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn Central Asia, too, there is considerable\r\npotential for developing the relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE. In recent years, the\r\nOSCE has strengthened its presence in the region\r\nconsiderably, and today there are OSCE offices in all\r\nfive Republics. A number of United Nations agencies\r\nalso have well-established programmes in these\r\ncountries. We should therefore look for ways of\r\nenhancing cooperation, identifying areas where\r\nsynergy can be achieved and maximizing the total\r\nimpact of the efforts of the international community.\r\nAs the effectiveness of the OSCE increases, the\r\nUnited Nations will be able to leave more of the\r\nresponsibility for European crisis management to the\r\nOSCE as its regional partner. This of course does not\r\nmean that the United Nations will, or should, renounce\r\nits overall responsibility to represent, speak for and act\r\non behalf of the international community. The United\r\nNations will still be the Organization that authorizes\r\nand legitimizes action by the OSCE. There will still be\r\nsituations that can be dealt with only by resorting to the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council. But within\r\nthe framework of the close cooperation and contact I\r\nhave just outlined, the OSCE will increasingly be in a\r\nposition to make important contributions to security\r\nand stability. It will be able to act on behalf of, or in\r\nsupport of, the United Nations, but also on its own,\r\nthus enabling the United Nations to concentrate more\r\nof its attention and limited resources on conflict\r\nmanagement in other parts of the world where regional\r\nframeworks are not as well developed as in Europe.\r\nToday, the OSCE has taken on a pronounced\r\noperational character. It has permanent field presences\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nin the 20 countries and conflict areas, in the Balkans,\r\nthe Caucasus and other parts of the former Soviet\r\nUnion, including Central Asia. Their tasks fall under\r\nthe general headings of conflict prevention, conflict\r\nmanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation. In fact,\r\nthe OSCE is now present in some capacity in every\r\nactual or potential trouble spot on the European\r\ncontinent. That makes it unique among European\r\nsecurity institutions, and adds a special legitimacy to\r\nits efforts.\r\nLet me also touch briefly on the situation in the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. As a result of the\r\nmomentous developments in Serbia following the\r\nelections on 24 September, the participation of the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations\r\nand the OSCE is no longer a remote vision. We believe\r\nthat it is important that there be close contact between\r\nthe United Nations and the OSCE on this issue. The\r\nAustrian Chairperson-in-Office has invited President\r\nKostunica to be represented at the upcoming OSCE\r\nMinisterial meeting in late November and, as we have\r\nheard today, made it clear that she is ready to receive a\r\nformal application for OSCE participation from the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that the OSCE will\r\ncontinue to be an essential partner of the United\r\nNations in the years to come: a partner that is prepared\r\nto work hand in hand with the United Nations in laying\r\nthe foundation for economic and social development\r\nand easing the burden of the world Organization in\r\nconflict prevention and conflict management in the\r\nOSCE area.\r\nMr. Levitte (France) (spoke in French): It is my\r\nhonour to take the floor on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. The associated countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope — the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia,\r\nLithuania, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia — as well\r\nas Malta, also an associated country, align themselves\r\nwith this statement.\r\nOne year after the Summit in Istanbul, the\r\nministerial meeting of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which will be held\r\non 27 and 28 November in Vienna, will provide an\r\nopportunity to draw up a balance sheet of the\r\nimplementation of the principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter on European Security, as well as of the\r\nimplementation of the commitments undertaken for the\r\noperational strengthening of the OSCE and for the\r\nsettlement of existing conflicts.\r\nIn this connection, regarding cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OSCE, the European Union\r\nwishes to draw attention to the Platform for\r\nCooperative Security, which is annexed to the Charter\r\non European Security. This Platform is aimed at\r\npromoting the mutual strengthening of the\r\norganizations and institutions charged with promoting\r\noverall security in the OSCE’s area of competence. It\r\nalso provides for the modalities of practical and\r\neffective cooperation. The OSCE works for conflict\r\nprevention, early warning, crisis management and post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation.\r\nAs the conflicts in the Balkans during the last\r\ndecade demonstrated, the strengthening of security and\r\nstability requires the adoption of measures in all three\r\ndimensions of the OSCE’s activities corresponding to\r\nthe three Helsinki baskets in the time of the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE):\r\ndemocracy and human rights, economic development\r\nand security issues.\r\nThe European Union, which contributes 67 per\r\ncent of the OSCE budget, believes that that\r\norganization, the only one that covers all the aspects of\r\noverall security covering the entire European continent,\r\nis, of course, called upon to play an essential role.\r\nThe European Union hopes that the ministerial\r\nmeeting will make it possible to take note of the\r\nprogress towards strengthening the operational\r\ncapacities of the organization, made necessary by an\r\nincrease in the organization’s field missions and by the\r\ndiversified tasks entrusted to it.\r\nThe European Union has contributed actively to\r\nthe negotiations that are under way in connection with\r\nthe OSCE document on small arms and light weapons.\r\nThe European Union believes that the adoption of such\r\na document at the next ministerial meeting of the\r\nOSCE, will also contribute substantially to the\r\npreparation of the 2001 United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nAll Its Aspects.\r\nIn order to be able, effectively and rapidly, to\r\ndeploy experts to a region in crisis in implementation\r\nof a mandate given to it directly or delegated to it by\r\nanother organization, particularly the United Nations,\r\nthe OSCE has, within the framework of the Rapid\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nExpert Assistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT)\r\nmechanism, has endeavoured to make the procedure for\r\nrecruitment and assignment of personnel to its field\r\nmissions more rational and more transparent. The\r\nEuropean Union is participating actively in the work\r\nunder way and will seek to ensure that it conforms with\r\nthe work that it has itself done to establish non-military\r\nmeans to respond to crises.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Ms. Louise Fréchette, and the High\r\nRepresentative for the Common Foreign and Security\r\nPolicy of the European Union, Mr. Javier Solana, were\r\ninvited to participate in the OSCE ministerial meeting\r\nin order to discuss the possibility of cooperation in the\r\nfield of crisis management.\r\nThe operation centre created within the OSCE\r\nsecretariat should facilitate the preparation and\r\ndeployment of new missions. The member countries of\r\nthe Union have made available experts for high-level\r\nposts in that centre. The European Union hopes that\r\nclose ties of cooperation will be established with the\r\nbody that has a similar field of competence within the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat. The European Union is\r\nparticipating actively in the consideration now under\r\nway of how to provide the OSCE with legal capacity,\r\nwhich, without calling into question the Organization’s\r\nflexibility, is vital to the improvement of its daily\r\noperations and its relationships with the personnel it\r\nemploys, as well as with the authorities of the countries\r\nthat receive missions.\r\nThe Union is delighted at the new prospects for\r\nthe participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nin the OSCE following the democratic changes that\r\nhave taken place in Belgrade and the generally positive\r\nattitude towards the OSCE expressed by the new\r\nYugoslav President. The Union hopes it will be\r\npossible for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to be\r\nwelcomed into the OSCE as soon as possible,\r\nfollowing the steps and the procedures now under way.\r\nWith regard to Kosovo, the European Union,\r\nwhich provides important support for the work of the\r\nOSCE mission, is delighted at the intensive and fruitful\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE\r\nin Kosovo. It wishes to pay tribute to the work\r\naccomplished by the OSCE in connection with the\r\nmunicipal elections of 28 October, including the\r\nphysical preparation of the elections, rapid and proper\r\nregistration of the population and the political parties,\r\nthe establishment of guidelines and electoral lists, as\r\nwell as campaign support, media monitoring and\r\nadvice to political parties. The European Union recalls\r\nthat a large number of actions of the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo are the\r\nresult of close cooperation between pillars two and\r\nthree, which relate respectively to the United Nations\r\nand the OSCE in the field.\r\nThe Union welcomes the success in Croatia of the\r\nwork of the police-monitoring group in Eastern\r\nSlavonia and the region of the Danube, which has led\r\nto the recent decision to reduce and restructure that\r\nspecific area of activity, which the OSCE mission in\r\nCroatia had taken over from the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\r\nBaranja and Western Sirmium. This illustrates how the\r\nwork of the United Nations and the OSCE can follow\r\neach other and be coordinated in a context of post-\r\nconflict normalization. The important progress made\r\nby Croatia with respect to its commitments have\r\ncontributed to this success, and we have all just heard\r\nthe message addressed to us by the Ambassador of\r\nCroatia in this regard.\r\nThe European Union continues to appreciate the\r\nexcellent cooperation of the OSCE and the United\r\nNations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It firmly\r\nappeals for the adoption by the Parliament and the\r\nauthorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the\r\npermanent electoral law, as soon as possible following\r\nthe elections of 11 November, which should be the last\r\none held under the OSCE provisional rules. The Union\r\nbelieves that as the progressive transfer of electoral\r\ncompetence to the Bosnian authorities is accomplished,\r\nthe Mission should further concentrate on tasks related\r\nto democratization, the promotion of human rights and\r\nthe rule of law, transferring the electoral segment to the\r\nresponsibility of the Office of Democratic Institutions\r\nand Human Rights, as is the rule.\r\nThe Union recalls the support it also gives to the\r\nOSCE presence in Albania through the Group of\r\nFriends, over which it co-presides, and to the OSCE\r\nmission in former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nWith regard to Albania, the European Union also\r\nwelcomes the support provided by the OSCE in the\r\nfield of electoral procedures. During the last elections\r\nin Albania, that OSCE contribution proved extremely\r\nuseful. We expect that efforts in that direction will\r\ncontinue with a view to improving electoral procedures\r\nand structures.\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nThe Union hopes that the conditions required for\r\nthe immediate return to Chechnya of the OSCE\r\nAssistance Group will now be met, so that it can act to\r\nimplement the mandate defined in 1995, whose validity\r\nwas reaffirmed at the Istanbul Summit. Discussions on\r\nthe technical and organizational details, and in\r\nparticular on questions of security, should be\r\ncompleted as soon as possible. The Union gives its\r\nsupport to the efforts made by the OSCE Minsk Group\r\nand its co-chairpersons in order to facilitate the search\r\nfor a negotiated solution to the conflict in Nagorny\r\nKarabakh. It calls on all the parties involved to display\r\na spirit of compromise, and considers the will\r\nexpressed by the heads of State of Armenia and\r\nAzerbaijan to continue the direct dialogue they have\r\nbegun an encouraging sign, and it hopes that a formula\r\nacceptable to all will promptly be found. The European\r\nUnion, in cooperation with the institutions of the\r\nUnited Nations system and other international\r\norganizations, is determined to make its contribution to\r\nsupport a settlement agreement.\r\nThe Union believes that Russia must respect the\r\ncommitment it undertook at the Istanbul Summit to\r\ncomplete by the end of 2002 the elimination of arms\r\nand munitions stockpiles still stationed in the\r\nMoldovan region of Transdnestr. It noted the proposals\r\nmade by Mr. Primakov at the time, who expressed on\r\nbehalf of the Russian Federation, a will to be further\r\ninvolved in the search for a settlement. The Union will\r\nsupport the efforts of the OSCE acting president to\r\narrive at a political settlement on the future status of\r\nthat region.\r\nThe European Union is delighted at the progress\r\nnoted during the meeting of experts devoted to South\r\nOssetia in Georgia, held under the auspices of the\r\nOSCE last July near Vienna. It hopes that the possible\r\nbasis for settlement identified at that time will be\r\nendorsed at the political level. The Union is prepared to\r\nprovide financial assistance for the implementation of\r\nan agreement and has already designed a plan of\r\nassistance for the elimination of small arms.\r\nThe deteriorated human rights situation in\r\nAbkhazia in Georgia continues to be a concern. The\r\ncooperation between the OSCE and the United Nations\r\nensures the proper functioning of the joint human\r\nrights office opened in Sukhumi. The Union hopes that\r\nthe two organizations will join their efforts in order to\r\ngather information on alleged violations of human\r\nrights in the district of Gali and to examine the\r\npossibility of opening an office in Gali.\r\nFinally, the Union believes there is a need to\r\nrespond to the concerns expressed by the authorities of\r\nthe Central Asia States, given the mounting threats\r\nposed by drug trafficking, organized crime and\r\nterrorism. In this context, the Union is pleased at the\r\njoint initiative of the acting presidency of the OSCE\r\nand the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) to hold an international\r\nconference on this subject on 19 and 20 October in\r\nTashkent. However, it is appropriate to choose a careful\r\napproach to these three phenomena, which while\r\nsomewhat interrelated are nevertheless different in\r\nnature and therefore deserve different treatment. For its\r\npart, the European Union has taken the initiative to\r\ndevelop a plan to combat drug trafficking. In general\r\nterms the European Union welcomes the OSCE efforts\r\nto improve cooperation among the international\r\norganizations that are present in Central Asia.\r\nI apologize for having spoken at such length and\r\nin such detail. The States of the European Union\r\nwanted to emphasize at this debate the close\r\ncooperation that has developed between the United\r\nNations, the OSCE — the sole organization to cover\r\nthe entire European continent — and the European\r\nUnion with its 15 member States. This tripartite\r\ncooperation is an excellent example of what the United\r\nNations can accomplish with the full cooperation of\r\nregional organizations.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Only six weeks ago,\r\nduring the Millennium Summits of the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, two important\r\ndocuments were adopted at the United Nations, namely,\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and resolution 1318\r\n(2000) — both of which contain provisions calling for\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, in accordance with\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. The\r\nissue of further developing cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) thereby assumes\r\nadditional importance as one of the priority tasks of the\r\ncoming century.\r\nOver the past 25 years of its activities, the OSCE\r\nhas accumulated considerable experience in\r\nmaintaining security and stability in Europe. At\r\npresent, this unique trans-Atlantic, pan-European and\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nEuro-Asian organization has been transformed into a\r\nmajor partner of the United Nations. It is rightfully\r\nconsidered a key political factor in efforts to achieve\r\ncollective security across the area of its responsibility,\r\nin particular, in the fields of conflict prevention, crisis\r\nmanagement, arms control and disarmament, and post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation.\r\nAs a member of both the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE, Ukraine notes with satisfaction the growing,\r\nmutually reinforcing interaction between the two\r\norganizations. In our view, the OSCE Istanbul Summit,\r\nwhich was held in November 1999, provided a\r\nqualitatively new foundation for this cooperation. In\r\nfact, the documents adopted at Istanbul substantially\r\nenhanced the OSCE’s conceptual basis and operational\r\ncapabilities by defining a number of agreed steps to be\r\ntaken by its participating States with a view to ensuring\r\nfreedom, prosperity and security. Of particular\r\nimportance was the adoption of the Charter for\r\nEuropean Security and, within its framework, the\r\nPlatform for Cooperative Security, which should serve\r\nas a good basis for closer partnership between the\r\nOSCE and other international organizations, in\r\nparticular, the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report submitted in\r\ndocument A/55/98 provides many good examples of\r\nsuch cooperation. Ukraine welcomes the many\r\nmeetings that have taken place between officials of the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, as well as the ninth\r\nhigh-level meeting of the United Nations-OSCE-\r\nCouncil of Europe tripartite process of informal\r\nconsultations, which for the first time was attended by\r\na representative of the European Commission. We\r\nsupport the practice of expanding the format of\r\nconsultative machinery between the United Nations\r\nand the OSCE and other international bodies.\r\nIt is also our belief that cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations can be strengthened through joint\r\nendeavours to develop a comprehensive strategy for\r\nconflict prevention on the basis of widespread use of\r\npreventive diplomacy and peace-building on a\r\nEuropean and global scale. The implementation of this\r\nidea would be largely in consonance with the proposal\r\nput forward by President Kuchma of Ukraine at the\r\nMillennium Summit and at the Security Council\r\nSummit to develop a comprehensive United Nations\r\nstrategy for conflict prevention. Ukraine is of the view\r\nthat a practical step towards developing such a strategy\r\non conflict prevention would be to create regional\r\ncentres on conflict prevention. In this context, let me\r\nrecall Ukraine’s recent proposal to establish a regional\r\ncentre for ethnic studies at Kyiv under the auspices of\r\nthe OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities.\r\nWe think the activities of such institutions devoted to\r\nthe monitoring of the current state and development of\r\ninter-ethnic relations in the OSCE region would also\r\ncontribute to the implementation of the United Nations\r\npreventive strategy in cooperation with the OSCE.\r\nMy country is fully aware of the established\r\ndivision of labour between the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE with regard to the settlement of conflict in the\r\nOSCE area. We recognize that this division of leading\r\nroles in peacemaking efforts is based on the\r\ncomparative advantages of the two organizations in\r\nview of their existing constraints. At the same time, we\r\nshare the view that all further steps aimed at enhancing\r\ncooperation between the two organizations and their\r\nmissions in zones of conflict should seek to make\r\nbetter use of the resources of the international\r\ncommunity in the interests of the countries being\r\nassisted.\r\nMy country is seriously concerned about the\r\ncurrent state of peace settlement for many of the\r\nconflicts in the OSCE region. First of all, I would like\r\nto refer to the situation in Kosovo. While recognizing\r\nthe undeniable achievements of the OSCE as one of the\r\npillars of institution-building of the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),\r\nwe are convinced that much more has to be done to\r\nmake the peace process in the province irreversible and\r\nto bring long-awaited stability to the entire Balkans.\r\nWe hope that the new political environment created by\r\nthe recent presidential elections in the Federal Republic\r\nof Yugoslavia will be fully conducive to that end.\r\nWe are also convinced that the OSCE — with\r\npossible assistance from the United Nations — should\r\ntake a more active stance to bring about final resolution\r\nof so-called frozen conflicts in the post-Soviet\r\nterritory — in particular in Abkhazia and South Ossetia\r\nin Georgia, in the Nagorny Karabakh region of\r\nAzerbaijan, and in the Trans-Dniester region of\r\nMoldova. Ukraine, as a contributor of personnel to the\r\nOSCE missions in Kosovo, Georgia and Nagorny\r\nKarabakh, and as one of the guarantor States in the\r\nsettlement of the conflict in Transdniestria, stands\r\nready to contribute further to the achievement of these\r\ngoals.\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nUkraine is grateful for the ongoing assistance\r\nrendered to us jointly by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, OSCE, the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the OSCE High\r\nCommissioner on National Minorities through their\r\ninter-agency support for the resettlement and\r\nintegration of formerly deported people returning to\r\nCrimea.\r\nIt is well known that Ukraine, with a multi-ethnic\r\npopulation of over 130 ethnic groups, is among the\r\nvery few newly independent States that have managed\r\nto avoid inter-ethnic conflict and to preserve peace and\r\nsecurity on its territory. The Ukrainian legislation on\r\nnational minority rights has received high praise from\r\nthe Council of Europe, which recognized its full\r\ncompliance with OSCE norms and principles. Ukraine\r\nis the only country in the region in which the OSCE\r\nmission to the autonomous Republic of Crimea\r\nsuccessfully fulfilled its mandate, in 1999, concluding\r\nthat the problems of national minorities had been\r\nsolved by the Government of Ukraine and that the\r\nsituation in the peninsula was no longer a cause for\r\nconcern.\r\nMindful of all this, the President of Ukraine\r\nrecently decided to submit the candidature of the\r\nformer Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Mr. Tarasyuk, to\r\nthe post of OSCE High Commissioner on National\r\nMinorities. The elections are to take place at the next\r\nOSCE ministerial meeting, which is to be held in\r\nVienna at the end of November 2000. We hope that his\r\ncandidature will enjoy overwhelming support.\r\nFinally, we believe that the draft resolution to be\r\nadopted at a later stage during the current session of\r\nthe General Assembly will contribute to further\r\nstrengthening the mutually complementary cooperation\r\nthat exists between the United Nations and the OSCE.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express our\r\nadmiration for Austria’s performance of its duties as\r\nOSCE Chairman-in-Office. We congratulate Minister\r\nFerrero-Waldner on her outstanding personal\r\ncommitment to that task. We also wish the same\r\nsuccess to Romania, which is to take up those\r\nresponsibilities next year.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Russian Federation deems it essential to\r\nfurther improve and intensify United Nations\r\ncooperation with regional organizations, in accordance\r\nwith Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nWe have consistently advocated the\r\ninstitutionalization of forms of interaction and\r\ncooperation as well as the more effective use of the\r\ncapacities and resources of regional organizations. Of\r\ncourse, this should be done while preserving the\r\nprimary responsibility of the Security Council for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe welcome the further development of the\r\npractice of regular meetings between top officials of\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat and leading regional\r\norganizations. We must increase the practical returns\r\nfrom these events. This applies, of course, to\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE).\r\nThe OSCE has unique experience in disarmament\r\nand arms control, the implementation of confidence-\r\nbuilding measures and the promotion of\r\ndemocratization in the Euro-Atlantic area. We believe\r\nthat it should play a central system-building and\r\ncoordinating role in European matters, not only in\r\npreventive diplomacy, conflict prevention and crisis\r\nsettlement, but also in other areas where the OSCE’s\r\nkey advantages — a comprehensive approach to\r\nsecurity problems and the wide span of its geographic\r\ncoverage — can be used. In addition, the OSCE’s\r\nfunctions in the area of legal norm-making must be\r\nmaintained and strengthened. The OSCE should also\r\ndefine the principles and realities of inter-State and\r\ninter-institutional relations. Indeed, it should be a kind\r\nof trendsetter in this area.\r\nThe full use of the OSCE’s unique potential will\r\nmake it possible to create a system of equal security in\r\nthe Euro-Atlantic area that is based on maintaining the\r\nbalance of interests of all countries in the region. The\r\norganization must not be allowed to become an\r\ninstrument for furthering the narrow interests or\r\nexpanding the sphere of influence of certain States,\r\ngroups of States or military-political alliances. Such a\r\ntrend, if not neutralized, will inevitably result in the\r\nOSCE’s dying out.\r\nWe attach great importance to the forthcoming\r\nmeeting of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs\r\nof the OSCE member States, to be held in Vienna from\r\n27 to 28 November. The Russian delegation has\r\nintroduced a number of important proposals for that\r\nmeeting, including an OSCE declaration on the\r\noccasion of its twenty-fifth anniversary. We believe\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nthat document could address the important issue of\r\ncooperation to effectively counter emerging risks and\r\nchallenges, in particular the revival of fascism and\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nWe believe that in view of its experience and\r\nsphere of competence, the OSCE should also play an\r\nactive role in the implementation of the Stability Pact\r\nfor South-eastern Europe, including the overall\r\nmonitoring of that initiative. Progress on the\r\nimplementation of the Pact should be assessed at the\r\nmeeting of the OSCE Council of Ministers of Foreign\r\nAffairs next month.\r\nUnited Nations-OSCE cooperation is becoming\r\nan important factor in strengthening global and\r\nregional stability. Such cooperation should be further\r\nfocused on areas of key significance for the\r\ninternational community. These include helping to\r\nprevent and settle conflicts; ensuring the humanitarian\r\naspects of security, including respect for human rights\r\nand the rights of national minorities; and building\r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\nWe believe also that the OSCE should concentrate\r\non specific objectives, without substituting for the\r\nUnited Nations in those areas where the latter, because\r\nof its universality, can effectively coordinate the\r\nactions of various organizations and institutions.\r\nIn this context, we attach great significance to the\r\ninteraction between the OSCE High Commissioner on\r\nNational Minorities, the OSCE Office for Democratic\r\nInstitutions and Human Rights and their corresponding\r\npartners within the United Nations system, primarily\r\nthose operating in Geneva.\r\nRussia welcomes and supports the further\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OSCE in the Balkans, in the process of\r\nconflict settlement in Abkhazia, Georgia, and Nagorny\r\nKarabakh, and in post-conflict peace-building in\r\nTajikistan. Cooperation between the two organizations\r\nin resolving the problem of victims of forced migration\r\nwithin the territory of the countries of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States countries is very\r\npromising.\r\nWe welcome also the mutually complementary\r\nefforts of the Economic Commission for Europe and\r\nthe OSCE secretariat Coordinator on Economic and\r\nEnvironmental Issues.\r\nTurning to the draft resolution on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OSCE, which the\r\nAssembly will be considering later, let me emphasize\r\nthat we deem it essential that the draft be adopted by\r\nconsensus. To that end, purely regional issues unrelated\r\nto the item should not be artificially introduced into the\r\ntext. The draft should focus on the framework policy\r\nfor cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nWe expect that the adoption of this draft\r\nresolution, which Russia has traditionally co-\r\nsponsored, will provide important additional impetus\r\nfor increasing the practical returns from the interaction\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OSCE.\r\nMr. Dacaru (Romania): I should like to start by\r\nexpressing Romania’s full support for the statement\r\njust made by the representative of France on behalf of\r\nthe European Union and associated countries.\r\nAllow me, as the representative of the next\r\nChairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to add some\r\nspecific comments. I am deeply honoured to address\r\nthe Assembly on this important agenda item on the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the OSCE.\r\nOur OSCE chairmanship in 2001 is one of our\r\nmajor foreign-policy priorities and will be guided by\r\nthe following main principles and objectives:\r\nincreasing the OSCE’s contribution to a free,\r\ndemocratic, prosperous and undivided Europe;\r\nfostering the OSCE’s role as a forum for political\r\ndialogue and cooperation in the field of comprehensive\r\nsecurity; identifying the means by which the political\r\nwill of the OSCE States could be commensurate with\r\nthe possibilities and operational capabilities of the\r\norganization; increasing the efficiency of the OSCE’s\r\nactivities, operations, institutions and mechanisms;\r\nrespecting the OSCE’s achievements and working to\r\nensure compliance by all participating States with its\r\nprinciples, standards, norms and values; maintaining\r\nthe dynamic and flexible character of the OSCE\r\nstructures, which should be open and able to adapt\r\nquickly to the new priorities and challenges; and\r\nfostering the OSCE’s cooperation with other\r\ninstitutions and organizations.\r\nOur ultimate goal will be to contribute to the\r\nimprovement of the political, economic and\r\nenvironmental security of the citizens of OSCE\r\nmember States, based on respect for human rights, in\r\norder to achieve prosperity and social justice. We will\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\ndo our utmost to ensure that the OSCE makes its\r\ncontribution in this respect.\r\nBased on these general objectives, Romania has\r\nalready identified some concrete priorities. Allow me\r\nto comment on a few of them.\r\nIn the field of conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement, one of our priorities will remain, of\r\ncourse, the situation in the Balkans. In our view, the\r\nrecent political changes in Belgrade have created an\r\nimportant opportunity for long-term stabilization in the\r\narea. We will focus strongly on post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation and assistance in the setting up of\r\ndemocratic institutions and the strengthening of the\r\nrule of law in the region. Preventive diplomacy is also\r\nvery important in the region, and increasing\r\nintraregional cooperation is a must. This should be\r\ncomplemented by the implementation of the Stability\r\nPact for South-Eastern Europe.\r\nIn addition to the Balkans, the Caucasus will be a\r\nfocal point of our activities during our chairmanship of\r\nthe OSCE, with special focus on the situation in\r\nChechnya and Nagorny Karabakh. The implementation\r\nof the Istanbul Summit decisions concerning the\r\nwithdrawal of foreign troops from Georgia and the\r\nRepublic of Moldova are issues to which we also attach\r\nhigh importance.\r\nWe shall also focus on developments in Central\r\nAsia, with a view to strengthening the OSCE\r\ninvolvement in the region. Given a background of huge\r\ndisparities — political, social and economic —\r\nbetween the five States and great ethnic diversity in the\r\nregion, the risk of extreme instability is still high and\r\nthe situation will require adequate attention from the\r\norganization. Other tasks of the organization under the\r\nRomanian chairmanship will include participation in\r\npreparing for and observing elections in a number of\r\nOSCE member States. In this context, we will put\r\nspecial emphasis on strengthening the OSCE’s\r\nresources and operational capabilities as a field\r\norganization, especially through the implementation of\r\nthe high-level commitments and decisions related to\r\nthis issue.\r\nWith respect to the human dimension, the\r\nRomanian chairmanship will contribute to addressing\r\nsuch issues as the prevention of the torture of children\r\nin armed conflict, the situation of internally displaced\r\npersons and the problem of trafficking in human\r\nbeings. Last, but not least, we will continue to pay\r\nattention to non-conventional challenges to European\r\nsecurity. That is why Romania has proposed that the\r\n2001 OCSE Economic Forum should concentrate on\r\nthe issue of transparency and good governance in\r\neconomic matters.\r\nThe multifaceted and complex nature of security\r\nin the OSCE region in recent years has underlined the\r\nfact that no organization acting alone is able to cope\r\nwith the current challenges. To implement the priorities\r\nthat I have underlined, therefore, we shall attempt to\r\nimprove cooperation between the OSCE and other\r\ninstitutions and organizations, especially the United\r\nNations, and render it operational. The recent report of\r\nthe Secretary-General in document A/55/98, for which\r\nwe extend our warm congratulations, fully\r\ndemonstrates that cooperation between the two\r\norganizations has, indeed, intensified over the past\r\nyear. Romania will make every effort to further\r\nenhance the relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the OSCE as a regional organization under Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. During the next\r\nyear, we will continue to maintain close coordination\r\nthrough regular contacts at all levels.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to commend the\r\nexcellent work done by the Austrian Chairperson-in-\r\nOffice, Her Excellency Mrs. Benita Ferrero-Waldner,\r\nand assure the Secretary General of the OSCE, Mr. Ján\r\nKubiš, of our full support.\r\nMr. Kobayashi (Japan): Since the end of the cold\r\nwar, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) has been contributing to stability and\r\npeace in Europe and central Asia through a broad range\r\nof activities in the political, economic, social and\r\nhumanitarian fields. It has carried out many of its\r\nactivities in close cooperation with various bodies\r\nwithin the United Nations system. I am pleased to have\r\nthis opportunity to describe briefly the ways in which\r\nJapan, as a partner for cooperation, participates in and\r\ncontributes to the activities of the OSCE, particularly\r\nits operations in South-Eastern Europe.\r\nSince 1996, Japan has sent over 100 election\r\nobservers to Bosnia and Herzegovina to help supervise\r\nthe elections there, and has contributed a total of $4.5\r\nmillion to that effort. Japan has also provided\r\npersonnel to, for example, the OSCE Spillover Monitor\r\nMission to Skopje and the OSCE mission to Croatia.\r\nFurthermore, Japan has participated in the OSCE\r\nmission in Kosovo with the contribution of more than\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\n$1 million of emergency assistance. Most recently, it\r\nhas dispatched two experts on the Balkans region to\r\ncontribute to OSCE efforts to ensure that the local\r\nelections to be held there are conducted in a free and\r\nfair manner. In support of the reconstruction and\r\ndemocratization process, Japan has also decided to\r\nassist media activities in Kosovo, contributing $14.5\r\nmillion for media equipment through the United\r\nNations Development Programme and the United\r\nNations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). This\r\nmedia-assistance project is currently being\r\nimplemented in cooperation with the OSCE.\r\nIn the belief that cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OSCE can contribute greatly, not only\r\nto the stability of the region, but also to international\r\npeace and security, Japan considers that it is very\r\nimportant to further strengthen the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OSCE.\r\nI would like to conclude my remarks by\r\nreaffirming Japan’s ongoing commitment to the\r\nactivities of the OSCE.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): I should like first of all\r\nto take this opportunity to welcome Mrs. Benita\r\nFerrero-Waldner, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Austria, in her capacity as Chairperson-in-Office of\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE).\r\nThe dramatic changes that the world has gone\r\nthrough during recent decades have created new\r\nopportunities for cooperation among nations, while\r\nposing new threats. This dichotomy makes cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\r\nmore urgent, if we are to both seize the emerging\r\nopportunities and meet the challenges facing the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nTen years ago, when the communist system\r\ncollapsed, many small and medium-sized countries,\r\nsuch as Armenia, could have been left in a political and\r\nsecurity vacuum. The OSCE had the vision and the\r\nleadership to include those countries in its structure,\r\nand thus provided small countries like Armenia with\r\nthe opportunity to anchor themselves in the community\r\nof European nations in accordance with\r\nlong-established political and social values. While we\r\nhope that this integration process will be an ongoing,\r\ncomprehensive one, we approach our engagement as\r\nboth a challenge and an opportunity.\r\nHistory has offered us an opportunity to create a\r\nnew foundation for our common destiny in the OSCE\r\narea. The guiding principles and commitments for this\r\ncommon future were laid down in the Helsinki Final\r\nAct. We believe that adherence to the principles of\r\ndemocracy, respect for human rights, fundamental\r\nfreedoms and the rule of law, enshrined in the Helsinki\r\nFinal Act, the Charter of Paris and other Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and OSCE\r\ndocuments, will create a new space free of dividing\r\nlines. In this regard, we consider the Charter on\r\nEuropean Security, adopted at the 1999 Summit of the\r\nOSCE, as a cornerstone of future European security.\r\nWe support the enhancement of the role of the\r\nOSCE as a major forum addressing the challenges in\r\nthe region through preventive diplomacy, conflict\r\nprevention, crisis management and post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation. Strengthening the role of the OSCE will\r\nenable it to better assume its responsibilities as a\r\nregional organization in accordance with Chapter VIII\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nToday, as some long-suppressed conflicts surface,\r\nwe notice with satisfaction that the OSCE is willing to\r\nrise to the challenge and explore new territory. In its\r\npursuit of solutions and its management of crises, the\r\nOSCE, a complex multinational organization, often\r\nneeds to reconcile principles and norms that, prima\r\nfacie, may not always appear to be compatible.\r\nIn his report contained in document A/55/98, the\r\nSecretary-General states that the United Nations and\r\nthe OSCE continued to practise a division of labour\r\nbased on the comparative advantages of the two\r\norganizations and notes, inter alia, that the OSCE has\r\nretained the lead in the resolution of the Nagorny\r\nKarabakh conflict. This approach is very much in line\r\nwith our view that the present format of the OSCE\r\nMinsk Group co-chairmanship is most appropriate for\r\nthe resolution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict,\r\nespecially given the fact that the OSCE is the sole\r\nmandated and authoritative body dealing with the\r\nissue.\r\nSince 1992 the OSCE has been actively involved\r\nthrough the various permutations of the Minsk process\r\nto define the elements for durable peace and stability.\r\nBeing advocates of a more flexible approach to the\r\nsettlement, the Government of Armenia, as well as the\r\nauthorities of Nagorny Karabakh, have accepted the\r\nrecent proposals of the Co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nGroup as a more realistic effort to address the issue of\r\nthe status of Nagorny Karabakh, with minimal\r\nprejudice to either of the competing claims.\r\nRegrettably, Azerbaijan has rejected those proposals.\r\nNevertheless, we hope that the intensified dialogue\r\nbetween the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan will\r\nenhance the peace process and help to bring about a\r\nlasting and comprehensive solution to the problem,\r\nthrough the resumption of negotiations within the\r\nOSCE Minsk Group, as stated in the Declaration of the\r\nOSCE Summit held in Istanbul, although we think that\r\ndirect negotiations between Azerbaijan and Nagorny\r\nKarabakh would be more productive.\r\nThe contemporary history of conflict resolution\r\nreflects the changing nature of inter- and intra-State\r\nrelations. It clearly shows the necessity of breaking\r\nthrough the frameworks of conventional perceptions of\r\nsovereignty. In this context, we are confident that the\r\nNagorny Karabakh conflict can be resolved only on the\r\nbasis of the legal equality of the parties to the conflict.\r\nAs the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia stated during the general debate,\r\n“For us, peace in Nagorny Karabakh\r\nrepresents, of course, the promise of transforming\r\na situation of hostility and confrontation with our\r\nneighbour, Azerbaijan, into one of cooperation\r\nand mutually reinforced security. We would like\r\nto think of the day when Karabakh is transformed\r\nfrom being a chasm separating our countries into\r\na bridge built for the benefit of all the populations\r\nconcerned”.(A/55/PV.21, p.12)\r\nArmenia is fully committed to the guiding\r\nprinciples of the OSCE. We always support and\r\nactively participate in all bilateral or regional\r\ninitiatives aimed at developing relations of good-\r\nneighbourliness and cooperation in our region. We\r\nreiterate our commitment to the arms control process as\r\none of the main security issues in the OSCE region. We\r\nbelieve that further strengthening of stability through\r\nconventional arms control will be decisive for future\r\nEuropean security.\r\nTo conclude, allow me to express our\r\nappreciation to the Permanent Representative of\r\nAustria and his delegation for the excellent work done\r\nduring their term as Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE.\r\nWe look forward to working closely with the\r\ndelegation of Romania, the incoming Chairman-in-\r\nOffice.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate. The draft resolution on this item will be\r\nsubmitted at a later date.\r\nAgenda item 22\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Committee\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/55/221)\r\nDraft resolution (A/55/L.12)\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt to introduce the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nMr. Gomaa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It is my\r\npleasure to introduce the draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee (AALCC),\r\nsince my country assumes the chairmanship of the\r\nCommittee this year.\r\nOver the past 45 years the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee has earned a unique status\r\nbecause of its promotion of legal cooperation between\r\nAsian and African States in the field of international\r\nlaw, which is of great importance to our countries. The\r\nCommittee’s initiatives have been welcomed in various\r\nUnited Nations conferences, particularly in conferences\r\ndealing with treaty law and the law of the sea. It has\r\nalso greatly contributed to the establishment of an\r\naccepted international legal order based on equality\r\nand fairness to all States.\r\nThe annual conferences of the Consultative\r\nCommittee are considered important events in the field\r\nof international law. My country, Egypt, had the honour\r\nof hosting the session of the Committee in Cairo in\r\nFebruary this year, at which a large number of\r\nMinisters and high officials from member States, as\r\nwell as different observer delegations and\r\nrepresentatives of international organizations, took part\r\nin valuable deliberations and exchanged views\r\nconcerning contemporary issues in international law,\r\nincluding the topics under examination in the\r\nInternational Law Commission (ILC) and matters\r\npertaining to the implementation of a world trade order.\r\nThe Secretary-General of the Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Committee expressed the\r\nCommittee’s viewpoints in the United Nations, where\r\nthe Committee has observer status and to which it\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\ncontributes, as well as to the International Law\r\nCommission, which the Secretary-General attends\r\nregularly. In addition to the annual meetings, several\r\ndiscussions take place during special sessions held by\r\nthe Committee. The Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee, for instance, organized special meetings in\r\nthe margins of the annual sessions to discuss the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\r\nthe law on reservations to treaties, on the treatment of\r\nrefugees, on the transboundary exercise of jurisdiction\r\nby States, as well as proposed meetings concerning the\r\nworld trade order and review of the special procedures\r\nfor the settlement of conflicts. These are but recent\r\nexamples of the work of the Committee.\r\nThe reports of the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee and declarations adopted by\r\nthe Committee as a result of those special sessions\r\nhave become an important source for the development\r\nof international law, as well as being a reflection of the\r\nviews and interests of the Asian and African States. It\r\nis worth mentioning in particular that the Committee\r\nhas also devoted itself to defining the common interests\r\nof African and Asian States as regards contemporary\r\nissues before the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations. In this way the Committee\r\nis contributing to the development of a fair, sound and\r\njust international legal order.\r\nIt is a source of pride to us all that the Committee\r\nis one of the international organizations working with a\r\nvery limited budget; its annual budget is one of the\r\nsmallest provided to international governmental\r\norganizations. The Committee has 45 member States,\r\nand there are plans to increase this number by the\r\naddition of French-speaking States on both continents,\r\nas well as of States from Central Asia and Southern\r\nAfrica.\r\nI encourage the Committee to increase its\r\nactivities. It has many progressive plans that would be\r\nbeneficial to all Member States. In this respect, I would\r\nlike to mention its training programmes for promoting\r\nthe teaching of international law and for providing\r\nlegal expertise in the area of international law. In\r\naddition, the Committee provides training on the\r\nmethodology of teaching international law at various\r\nuniversities in the member States, as well as\r\nfellowships for Asian and African students to carry out\r\npostgraduate studies in the field of international law.\r\nThe Committee also supports the publication of books\r\nand periodicals devoted to international law that are of\r\nparticular importance in Asia and Africa.\r\nIt is also worth mentioning that the Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Committee was established to\r\nprovide expertise in international law to the Asian and\r\nAfrican States and to provide specific assistance and\r\nadvice when needed on any aspect of international law\r\nof interest to the member States. Advice has been\r\ngiven, for example, on the development of an\r\nappropriate legal framework or necessary legislation\r\nfor the implementation of international treaties or\r\nmodel agreements for developing special joint\r\narrangements. In addition, advice of a legal nature has\r\nbeen provided to one or various individual States.\r\nIt is well known that such activities cannot be\r\nundertaken, nor can they successfully achieve their\r\npurposes, without the necessary resources and\r\nfinancing. The payments of arrears on assessed\r\ncontributions, as well as voluntary contributions, will\r\nundoubtedly help carry out such activities.\r\nAnother source of pride is that the work of the\r\nCommittee, despite financial constraints, is very well\r\norganized, thanks to a small group of experts in\r\ninternational law, who are guided by a group of\r\ninternational diplomats headed by an outstanding\r\nSecretary-General. Moreover, the Committee has an\r\nexcellent library, but it is imperative to improve its\r\nfacilities in due time. Then the Committee will be able\r\nto function as a documentation centre on international\r\nlaw in the service of Asian and African States.\r\nWe are confident that in the coming years the\r\nCommittee will devote greater attention to many issues\r\nand will be successful in explaining and consolidating\r\nthe common interests of the Asian and African\r\nStates — even the interests of the international\r\ncommunity. The Committee will also undoubtedly\r\nenhance its training activities and the spreading of\r\ninternational legal expertise among the Asian and\r\nAfrican States, a step that will enhance the role of these\r\nStates in the establishment of a world legal order that is\r\nfair and equitable for all States. We are certain also that\r\ncooperation between the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee and the United Nations will\r\nincrease progress towards this lofty goal.\r\nWe wish the Committee and all its members\r\nevery success and hope that the United Nations and its\r\nMember States will continue to extend vigorous\r\nassistance and support to the Committee.\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nI call upon the General Assembly to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution, contained in document A/55/L.12,\r\nwhich pertains to the item on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee. The draft resolution pays\r\ntribute to the Committee’s contributions and hopes that\r\nthey will continue. So far it has been sponsored by\r\nChina, Cyprus, Egypt, India, Indonesia, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Iraq, Jordan, the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Malaysia and Mongolia.\r\nMr. Gupta (India): We wish the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee (AALC) well, and have confidence that\r\nunder his leadership the Committee will attain new\r\nheights in serving the interests not only of the Asian\r\nand African States, but also of the wider membership\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIt is with great pleasure that we inform the\r\nAssembly that India and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee signed the Headquarters\r\nAgreement in April this year. Even though the\r\nCommittee has been situated in New Delhi since its\r\ninception and has enjoyed all the privileges and\r\nimmunities all along, the conclusion of a Headquarters\r\nAgreement, coming after the establishment of the\r\nCommittee’s permanent headquarters in New Delhi, is\r\nan important landmark in the relationship between the\r\nCommittee and India as the host country. The\r\nGovernment of India is making every effort to advance\r\nthe construction of a suitable headquarters building for\r\nthe office of the Committee and the residence of the\r\nSecretary-General, for which a grant of $1.5 million\r\nhas been earmarked in its budget.\r\nIn this connection, it is appropriate to place on\r\nrecord our sincere and highest appreciation for the\r\nwork and personality of Mr. Tang Chengyuan, who\r\ncompleted his term of office as Secretary-General of\r\nthe AALCC in May 2000. His service to the Committee\r\nand contribution to the Asian-African legal community\r\nduring his six-year term was marked by economy,\r\nefficiency and political wisdom. We wish him well in\r\nall his future endeavours.\r\nThe present Secretary-General, Ambassador\r\nWafik Kamil, has an ambitious programme and busy\r\nschedule ahead of him. His energy and enthusiasm will\r\nsee the AALCC successfully through many of the\r\nprogrammes. The agenda set out by the last annual\r\nmeeting of the Committee, held in Cairo in February\r\n2000, is an impressive one. The new areas are\r\nchallenging.\r\nThe success of the Committee’s work over the\r\nyears is attributable to its basic features. The main\r\nobjectives and functions of the AALCC are several-\r\nfold. The Committee was established essentially to\r\npromote international legal cooperation, develop and\r\ndisseminate expertise in international law by\r\norganizing annual meetings, seminars and workshops\r\nfocusing on current issues of international law under\r\nconsideration in different forums of the United Nations\r\nand other bodies, and to contribute to the process of\r\ncodification and development of international law.\r\nWhile all endeavours in the field of international law\r\nhave their political and policy implications, the efforts\r\nof the Committee have always been confined to areas\r\nof legal interest, while issues of political controversy\r\nhave been left for other forums within and outside the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAt the technical level, there are several areas to\r\nwhich the Committee could give priority: the work of\r\nthe International Law Commission, the contribution\r\nbeing made by the International Court of Justice,\r\nevolving international criminal law, legal issues arising\r\nfrom the multitude of international conventions under\r\nnegotiation, the operation of the international seabed\r\narea regime, principles applicable to outer space\r\nactivities and environmental law.\r\nWe are grateful to the AALCC for taking\r\ninitiatives in organizing special meetings on subjects of\r\ncontemporary relevance, in cooperation with other\r\ninternational organizations, such as the World\r\nIntellectual Property Organization and the World Trade\r\nOrganization. These meetings have resulted in the\r\npublication of some useful materials. In a joint\r\ninitiative with the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme last year, the AALCC brought out a\r\nhandbook on environmental law that is designed to\r\nprovide its users with a comprehensive collection of\r\nimportant global and regional environmental law\r\ndocuments. The AALCC publications are useful for\r\nbudding national and regional capacities to enhance\r\ncompliance with and implementation of global and\r\nregional agreements.\r\nWe wish the new Secretary-General all success in\r\nhis present term of office and assure him of our full\r\ncooperation.\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nMr. Bossiere (France) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated\r\nwith the European Union — Bulgaria, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,\r\nRomania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the associated\r\ncountries Cyprus and Malta, as well as Norway, as a\r\ncountry of the European Free Trade Association\r\nmember of the European Economic Area, align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nEvery two years, the item on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee provides an opportunity to\r\nreview cooperation which, from modest beginnings,\r\nhas intensified and grown to encompass a wide range\r\nof subjects. It covers economic, environmental and\r\nhumanitarian questions, as well as the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nWe wish to thank the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report, which describes the\r\nCommittee’s activities on subjects of interest to both\r\norganizations. The report describes the actions taken in\r\nthis context and testifies to the numerous consultations\r\nthat have been held between the Committee and\r\nvarious United Nations organs over the two-year\r\nperiod. We therefore wish particularly to emphasize the\r\nimportant role played by the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee in the programmes of the\r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law and in\r\nenvironment and sustainable development programmes,\r\nas well as its commitment to the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. These fields of activity\r\nwere mentioned in General Assembly resolution 53/14\r\nof October 1998.\r\nThe Committee’s initiatives, however, go beyond\r\nthese issues. For example, it was one of the six\r\nregional organizations chosen by the organizers of the\r\ncentennial celebrations for the first International Peace\r\nConference. We note with satisfaction the attention\r\npaid by the Consultative Committee to the work of the\r\nInternational Law Commission, in particular with\r\nregard to the settlement of disputes. The Committee’s\r\naction thereby supports the work of the United Nations\r\nand contributes to the progressive codification of\r\ninternational law by encouraging exchanges of views\r\nand of information.\r\nInitiatives taken by the Consultative Committee\r\nhave proven useful to the work of the Sixth Committee.\r\nThe special interest now taken by the Committee in\r\ninternational trade law and in the United Nations\r\nCommission on International Trade Law will doubtless\r\nhelp to assert the universal character of the latter’s\r\nproceedings. Similarly, attention paid by the\r\nCommittee to the functioning of the legal and\r\narbitration bodies established by the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea; to the operation of the bodies of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization; and to the proceedings of\r\nthe World Intellectual Property Organization will\r\ncertainly help to enrich their work.\r\nThat is why we hope that this cooperation will\r\ncontinue in the interest of the entire United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nMr. Qu Wensheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): At\r\nthe outset, I wish to thank Mr. Goma for his\r\nintroductory statement on the item on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Committee (AALCC). His\r\nintroduction allowed us to note with pleasure the\r\ngrowing relationship between the two organizations\r\nand their ever-widening spheres of cooperation.\r\nThe AALCC, as a legal consultative committee of\r\nAsian and African Governments, has been dedicated\r\nfrom the day of its inception to legal consultations and\r\ncoordination among member States. It considers and\r\nstudies the latest developments in international law. It\r\nundertakes in-depth studies of legal issues of interest to\r\nAsian and African States and has achieved positive\r\nresults. Experience has shown that the AALCC has not\r\nonly provided a forum for discussion and cooperation\r\non legal and related issues of common concern to\r\nAsian and African countries, but also made important\r\ncontributions to the development and codification of\r\ninternational law.\r\nSince attaining observer status in the General\r\nAssembly, the AALCC has increased its cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations. The United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the International Law Commission (ILC), the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization and the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees all send representatives to\r\nthe AALCC’s annual sessions. The AALCC in turn\r\nattends various meetings of United Nations bodies and\r\nactively participates in the deliberation of issues within\r\nits competence.\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nFor many years, the AALCC has treated legal and\r\nrelated issues of concern to the United Nations and its\r\nbodies as priority items on its agenda. In this regard,\r\nthe AALCC’s cooperation with the ILC stands out.\r\nEach year, the AALCC invites an ILC representative to\r\nattend its annual sessions and to give a briefing on the\r\nCommission’s work. It also places consideration of the\r\nILC report on its agenda, debates it and makes\r\nrecommendations. In turn, the Secretary-General of\r\nAALCC attends the ILC’s annual sessions and briefs\r\nthe Commission on its work. The two bodies enjoy\r\nvery satisfactory and fruitful cooperation.\r\nIn addition to international law, the AALCC’s\r\ncooperation with the United Nations is expanding into\r\nother areas, such as economic, social, environmental\r\nand humanitarian matters. For example, after the\r\ndecade of 1990 to 1999 was declared the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law, the AALCC right\r\naway compiled research material, decided on activities\r\nto be launched during the Decade and submitted a\r\nreport to the Secretary-General on a possible role of the\r\nAALCC in attaining the goals of the Decade.\r\nIn April 1999, during its thirty-eighth session, the\r\nAALCC held a special meeting on environmental law\r\nand published, in cooperation with the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme, the Asian-African Handbook\r\non Environmental Law.\r\nAs a member of the United Nations and the\r\nAALCC, China is pleased to see the increasingly close\r\nand broad cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nWe hope that they will strengthen their cooperation in\r\nareas of common concern in the new millennium,\r\nespecially with regard to the development and\r\ncodification of international law, which would thus\r\nprovide a good model of how global and regional\r\nintergovernmental organizations could closely\r\ncooperate for world peace and development.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches great\r\nimportance to the AALCC. Since 1983 when it became\r\na full member, China has actively participated in the\r\nAALCC’s work and vigorously supported it. China is\r\nready to further strengthen the role and impact of the\r\nAALCC and make a contribution to the close\r\ncooperation between it and the United Nations.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of\r\nIran): I wish to begin by expressing the appreciation of\r\nmy delegation to the Secretary-General for his report\r\non the “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee,” as\r\ncontained in document A/55/221.\r\nI also would like to warmly congratulate His\r\nExcellency Mr. Wafik Zaher Kamil, the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee (AALCC), for his election to this high\r\noffice. We are confident that under his stewardship the\r\nAALCC will grow further. I also wish to express our\r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Tang Chengyuan,\r\nthe former Secretary-General of the AALCC for his\r\noutstanding service.\r\nThe AALCC is a unique organization embodying\r\na large number of Asian and African States that are\r\nwilling to actively participate in making the law that\r\ngoverns relations among nations and to positively\r\ncontribute to the promotion of the rule of law in\r\ninternational relations. Since its foundation, the\r\nConsultative Committee has undertaken various studies\r\non international legal subjects of common concern to\r\nthe two continents. It has also facilitated the exchange\r\nof views and information among its members States on\r\ndevelopments relating to international legal matters and\r\nhas played a significant role in harmonizing the\r\npositions of Asian and African countries on major legal\r\nissues.\r\nIt needs to be underscored that the Consultative\r\nCommittee has undertaken a systematic and consistent\r\nstudy of items that are on the agendas of the Sixth\r\nCommittee of the General Assembly and the\r\nInternational Law Commission, from Asian and\r\nAfrican perspectives. Commentaries and\r\nrecommendations of this organization have been,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, reflected in the proceedings of\r\nthe United Nations legal organs and have assisted its\r\nmember States to actively participate in international\r\nlegal conferences.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAALCC on international legal matters began\r\nimmediately after the coming into existence of the\r\nConsultative Committee in 1956 and became\r\ninstitutional in 1980 when observer status was\r\naccorded to the AALCC by the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. The cooperation that continues to exist\r\ntoday has proved to be fruitful and has served the\r\nmutual interests of the two organizations. This\r\ncollaboration has been developed further in recent\r\nyears and is being carried out in several forms and\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\ncovers various subjects of high importance to the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nI need not dwell on various aspects of this\r\nflourishing relationship since the report before the\r\nAssembly illustrates in detail the valuable cooperation\r\ndeveloped between the two organizations. The areas of\r\ncooperation apart from the field of international law\r\nnow include subjects relating to economic,\r\nenvironmental and humanitarian law and peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes. I should like to highlight only a\r\nfew examples of this constructive cooperation:\r\nDuring the period under consideration, the\r\nConsultative Committee organized several seminars\r\nand workshops to promote adherence by its member\r\nStates to a number of instruments that have been\r\ndeveloped under the auspices of different bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations. It has also provided technical\r\nassistance to its members who wanted to become\r\nparties to these instruments. Beyond any doubt, the\r\npromotion and the dissemination of the international\r\ninstruments at the regional level is an essential factor\r\nfor better understanding of these documents, which in\r\nturn would facilitate their universal acceptance.\r\nThe wide range of topics on the agenda of the\r\nConsultative Committee is indicative of the resolve of\r\nthe Committee to positively contribute to the new\r\nchallenges of the international communities arising out\r\nof globalization. The Consultative Committee closely\r\nmonitors the legal developments relating to\r\ninternational economic cooperation for development.\r\nThe three seminars organized by the Committee in the\r\npast two years are examples of activities carried out by\r\nthe Committee to meet the challenges of the new era.\r\nLast but not the least, regional arbitration centres\r\nthat have been established in Cairo, Kuala Lumpur,\r\nTehran and Lagos, under the scheme established by the\r\nAALCC, represent a noteworthy step taken by the\r\nCommittee to promote the settlement of commercial\r\ndisputes at the regional level. This scheme aims at\r\nassisting the administration of national and\r\ninternational arbitration cases based on the rules that\r\nhave been developed by the United Nations\r\nCommission on International Trade Law.\r\nTo conclude, we feel that prospects for future\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee are promising.\r\nThis is why the Islamic Republic of Iran has\r\nco-sponsored the draft resolution on the cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations, as contained in\r\ndocument A/55/L.12, and hopes that this resolution\r\nwould be unanimously approved by this Assembly.\r\nMr. Anwar (Indonesia): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Committee,” contained in document\r\nA/55/221.\r\nMore than four decades ago, the Asian and\r\nAfrican nations established the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee (AALCC), an outcome of the\r\nhistoric Bandung Conference, to serve as an advisory\r\nbody to its member States in the field of international\r\nlaw and as a forum for Asian-African cooperation in\r\nlegal matters of common concern. Since its inception,\r\nits endeavours have surpassed our expectations. Apart\r\nfrom undertaking a number of significant studies in\r\ninternational law, it has served member States\r\neffectively by providing a forum for the exchange of\r\nviews and for harmonizing the views and positions of\r\nthe Asian and African countries on various aspects in\r\nthe codification and development of international law.\r\nAll this bodes well for the establishment of a world\r\norder based on justice and equity for all nations.\r\nOne of the main objectives of the AALCC is to\r\nenhance the progressive development of international\r\nlaw while forging close links between itself and the\r\nUnited Nations. This common goal was attained in\r\n1980 when the AALCC was accorded Permanent\r\nObserver status, laying the foundations for a\r\nflourishing cooperation between the two bodies. In this\r\nregard, it is pertinent to note that the Consultative\r\nCommittee has accorded close attention to the items on\r\nthe agenda of the Sixth Committee from the\r\nperspective of developing countries.\r\nThis cooperative framework has achieved\r\nconsiderable success. Close consultation in matters\r\nconcerning international law has now expanded to the\r\nfields of economic, environmental and humanitarian\r\nlaw as well as the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nDuring the past two years, the AALCC has participated\r\nin a number of important meetings and conferences\r\nwhich have included, among others, sessions of the\r\nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade\r\nLaw, the Preparatory Commission for the International\r\nCriminal Court, the observation of the centennial of the\r\nfirst International Peace Conference at The Hague, the\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme and the\r\nInternational Law Commission. Also, it is most\r\nrelevant that another item has been placed on its\r\nagenda concerning the extraterritorial application of\r\nnational legislation and sanctions imposed against third\r\nparties.\r\nSince the preparation of a study on strengthening\r\nthe role of the United Nations through the\r\nrationalization of its functional modalities with special\r\nreference to the General Assembly, in 1985, the\r\nAALCC has undertaken a number of initiatives to\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations by promoting\r\nits activities among its member States. Similarly, there\r\ncan be no doubt of its tireless efforts in contributing to\r\nthe success of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law.\r\nIt is also important to focus attention on the\r\nConsultative Committee’s endeavours to render\r\nassistance to its member States with a view to\r\nfacilitating their active participation in the meetings of\r\nthe Sixth Committee. In this regard, it is pertinent to\r\nnote AALCC’s work on the topic of the jurisdictional\r\nimmunities of States and their properties at its thirty-\r\nninth session. Furthermore, the assistance of the\r\nAALCC in ascertaining the feasibility of compiling the\r\nnational legislation, jurisprudence and practices of\r\nmember States is a worthy endeavour.\r\nOver the years, my delegation has acknowledged\r\nwith appreciation the AALCC’s close monitoring of the\r\nwork and functioning of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, as well as other related organs. As alluded to\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General, with the\r\ngrowing number of maritime delimitation cases being\r\nbrought before the International Court of Justice and\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the\r\nstudy of the law of the sea should be a priority for the\r\nAALCC member States.\r\nAs a developing country, Indonesia appreciates\r\nthe work of the AALCC on economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. My delegation is therefore gratified that\r\nthe AALCC organized, with financial and technical\r\nassistance, a one- day special meeting on “Electronic\r\nCommerce: Legal Issues and its Impact on Developing\r\nCountries”. In my delegation’s view this is an item of\r\nparticular importance in an electronic age of e-\r\ncommerce, intellectual property and complex issues\r\nrelating to contractual obligations.\r\nFinally, my delegation deems it a distinct pleasure\r\nto join in sponsoring the draft resolution on the item\r\nbefore us and hopes that it will receive the unanimous\r\nsupport of Member States.\r\nThe President: In accordance with resolution\r\n35/2 of 13 October 1980, I now call on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee, Mr. Wafik Kamil.\r\nMr. Kamil (Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee): It is an honour for me to address this\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly. May I at the outset\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee. I also wish to\r\nthank all the delegations who have spoken on the item\r\nand who have elaborated on the many topics in which\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAALCC exists.\r\nDestiny has allowed me today, for the first time in\r\nmy diplomatic career and on the eve of the dawn of the\r\nnew Millennium, to address the representatives of our\r\nplanet from the podium of the highest-level Assembly.\r\nAllow me to pay homage to the United Nations for its\r\n55 years of immense efforts for the sake of\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as to all the\r\nSecretaries-General of the Organization and to all\r\nprevious Presidents of the General Assembly who\r\nguided the international community towards peace,\r\nstability, development, peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\nrespect for human rights and basic freedoms and who\r\nhave tried, by all possible means, to relieve the\r\nsuffering from hunger, desertification, natural disasters,\r\nepidemics and so on of people in all corners of our\r\nplanet. We also applaud all those who spared no effort,\r\ngoodwill or vigilance in combating the “human\r\nplagues” who perpetrated horrors against their own\r\nbrothers and sisters.\r\nWhen we look back at the events of the last\r\ncentury, both pride and shame engulf our thoughts.\r\nTremendous advances were made in the fields of\r\nindustry, technology, science and medicine. However,\r\nthere were two world wars and numerous conflicts,\r\nkilling millions of people. The use of the most\r\ndestructive weapons of mass destruction — nuclear\r\nweapons — causes humanity to shudder even today.\r\nJust a few weeks ago, on the historic occasion of\r\nthe Millennium Summit, more than 150 heads of State\r\nand Government assembled in this very Hall and spoke\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nfrom this rostrum. The voices were many, but there was\r\na common message, and that was unity among\r\ndiversity — unity for the common goal of international\r\npeace, security and nuclear disarmament, protection of\r\nhuman rights and freedom, removal of poverty, disease\r\nand so on.\r\nThe Declaration adopted by the Millennium\r\nAssembly reaffirmed faith in the United Nations and its\r\nCharter as indispensable foundations of a more\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world. It recognized that\r\nwhile globalization offers great opportunities, benefits\r\nat present are unevenly shared and costs unevenly\r\ndistributed. This imbalance should be corrected to\r\nprovide the cornerstone of a just world and of the\r\nsuccess of efforts for globalization. The Assembly also\r\nresolved to strengthen respect for the rule of law in\r\ninternational affairs and to make the United Nations\r\nmore effective in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. We sincerely hope that the dawn of the new\r\nmillennium will bring a new awakening and a\r\ndetermination to make the world a safer and saner\r\nplace for present and future generations.\r\nIn order to achieve this objective, the United\r\nNations will and should play the central role. Humanity\r\nshould spare no effort to keep our United Nations, the\r\nheart of our planet, alive, productive and effective. It is\r\nheartening to note that in this context the Assembly\r\nstressed the need to strengthen cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations.\r\nAs a representative of a regional organization\r\nwho assumed the duties of Secretary-General in May\r\n2000, I would like to assure the Assembly that the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Committee\r\n(AALCC) will not fail in its duty. It is committed to the\r\nideals of the United Nations and is ready to share\r\nresponsibility in promoting the effective\r\nimplementation of various international conventions in\r\nareas such as arms control, disarmament, humanitarian\r\nlaw and human rights, terrorism, drug trafficking,\r\nenvironment and other relevant areas.\r\nIn recognition of its role, the accordance of\r\npermanent observer status to the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee by the General Assembly of\r\nthe United Nations in 1980 was a turning point in the\r\nhistory of the AALCC. It soon oriented its activities to\r\nsuit the needs and aspirations of its member States.\r\nWhen I prepared my statement on this item, I\r\nstudied, as the new Secretary-General of the AALCC,\r\nthe programme of cooperation in force between the\r\nworld Organization and the AALCC, which was agreed\r\npursuant to General Assembly resolution 36/38 of\r\n18 November 1981. This programme, besides\r\nestablishing a cooperative framework for mutual\r\nconsultation and representation, identified areas for\r\nfocused attention between the two organizations, such\r\nas the law of the sea, refugees, strengthening the role\r\nof the United Nations, illicit traffic in narcotic drugs\r\nand international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. Over the years great efforts have been\r\nmade by the AALCC to implement programmes in\r\nthese areas. Time does not permit me to elaborate in\r\ndetail. The Secretary-General’s report and all my\r\ncolleagues’ interventions have covered most of the\r\nareas of cooperation. I would only like to point out that\r\nthe study prepared by the AALCC on the occasion of\r\nthe fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, the\r\nAALCC’s study promoting the role of the International\r\nCourt of Justice and the establishment of the AALCC’s\r\nregional arbitration centres were just a few areas where\r\nthe AALCC has made useful contributions to\r\nsupplement the work of the United Nations.\r\nConcerning the existing cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and our Committee, I wish to state that\r\nthe AALCC, since its establishment in 1956, has been a\r\nmajor forum for cooperation among the States of the\r\nAsian-African regions on international law matters.\r\nAmong the numerous subjects considered by the\r\nCommittee, the law of the sea had and still has a\r\ndistinctive place. Concepts such as the exclusive\r\neconomic zone and archipelagic States had their origin\r\nin AALCC deliberations. On many other subjects, such\r\nas refugee law, human rights, the International\r\nCriminal Court, the environment, trade law matters and\r\nthe United Nations Decade of International Law, the\r\nCommittee made equally useful contributions.\r\nThe preparation of extensive studies to assist its\r\nmember States in participating in international legal\r\nconferences convoked under the auspices of the United\r\nNations and on selected items on the agenda of the\r\nannual session of the General Assembly became the\r\nregular activities of the AALCC secretariat. In\r\naddition, the holding of an annual meeting of legal\r\nadvisers of AALCC member States in New York and\r\nthe consideration by the General Assembly of the item\r\non cooperation between the AALCC and the United\r\nNations provided other opportunities to coordinate its\r\nactivities with the United Nations. Since I have\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nassumed the duties of Secretary-General, it has been\r\nmy endeavour to strengthen existing cooperation and\r\nfind new areas in which the AALCC could supplement\r\nthe work of the United Nations.\r\nIt has been the constant endeavour of the AALCC\r\nto promote wider acceptance of United Nations\r\nConventions. It will continue its focus on the core\r\ngroup of 25 multilateral treaties which reflect the key\r\npolicy goals of the United Nations and the spirit of the\r\nCharter, in respect of which the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General has made an appeal. It may not be\r\nout of place to mention here that apart from the United\r\nNations, the AALCC has concluded cooperation\r\nagreements with several United Nations agencies and\r\nother intergovernmental organizations, such as the\r\nLeague of Arab States, the Organization of African\r\nUnity, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Council\r\nof Europe. The thrust of these agreements is to\r\norganize joint programmes and meetings on topics of\r\ncurrent relevance. Invariably, the focus has been on the\r\npromotion of wider acceptance of international\r\nconventions, especially those concluded under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations and its agencies.\r\nI would like to touch briefly upon some of the\r\npressing issues that need urgent attention and are\r\nincluded in our programme of cooperation. A problem\r\nthat has assumed new dimensions and has aroused\r\ngreater concern is international terrorism. Illicit drug\r\ntrafficking, small-arms smuggling and nuclear\r\nterrorism are also complex issues that need urgent\r\nattention. The recently concluded Convention against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime, which I hope will be\r\nadopted by the General Assembly this year, together\r\nwith other international conventions dealing with\r\nspecific aspects of terrorism, provide useful a legal\r\nframework. However, the need for a comprehensive\r\nand concerted approach can hardly be overemphasized.\r\nIn recent years a great deal of attention has been\r\nfocused on human rights issues. The implementation of\r\ninternational conventions on these matters has stirred\r\nsome controversy. The basic concern of developing\r\ncountries is the recognition of their right to\r\ndevelopment. Their priorities are the eradication of\r\npoverty, creating better health conditions and\r\npromoting education and more employment\r\nopportunities for millions of their citizens. These\r\nperspectives should not be overlooked in determining\r\nthe norms and legal niceties involved in the\r\nimplementation of those conventions.\r\nAmong the recent initiatives aimed at enhancing\r\nthe AALCC’s role, the Committee has embarked upon\r\nnew programme areas. In order to highlight the\r\nimportance of issues related to globalization, it has\r\nfocused its attention on the work of the World Trade\r\nOrganization. The legal issues emanating from\r\ninformation technology are being taken up in close\r\ncooperation with the World Intellectual Property\r\nOrganization. With regard to refugee matters, the\r\nAALCC’s 1966 Bangkok Principles on the Status and\r\nTreatment of Refugees have been revised in\r\nconsultation and cooperation with the United Nations\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR). More recently, two weeks ago an agreement\r\nwas concluded with the International Organization for\r\nMigration to give in-depth consideration to migration\r\nissues. Closer cooperation with human rights\r\norganizations is being established to initiate joint\r\nprogrammes. With a view to strengthening the legal\r\nregime of non-proliferation and promoting the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy in the Asian and African region,\r\nthe organization of a training course in cooperation\r\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency is being\r\nconsidered.\r\nSuch high-sounding words as human dignity,\r\nequality and equity do not mean much for millions of\r\nhungry and poor people in many parts of the world.\r\nThe problem of refugees and displaced persons\r\ncontinues to haunt humanity. The protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict and the scourge of leftover\r\nlandmines in many parts of the world, along with the\r\nhuge costs of destroying them, are two other issues of\r\ngreat concern.\r\nA closely related aspect that has crippled the\r\neconomies and growth of many developing\r\ncountries — especially on the African continent — is\r\nthe debt burden. I appeal to developed countries from\r\nthis, the highest forum of mankind, to take a pragmatic\r\nview of this problem and find a solution to it. Without\r\na solution, and if developing countries are not relieved\r\nof this heavy burden, those countries will have great\r\ndifficulty in finding their way to development and new\r\ntechnologies to combat hunger, epidemics and similar\r\nproblems.\r\nIn connection with all these problems, I would\r\nlike to recall the “Declaration on the Enhancement of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and Regional\r\nArrangements or Agencies in the Maintenance of\r\nInternational Peace and Security”, which was adopted\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nby the General Assembly on 9 December 1994. That\r\nDeclaration emphasized that regional organizations can\r\nusefully complement the work of the United Nations in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nespecially in providing confidence-building measures\r\nin their specific regions. The AALCC would be pleased\r\nto continue and to strengthen its cooperation with\r\nregard to all the topics I have mentioned in order to\r\nattain international peace and security, strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation and enhance the rule of law.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt to introduce an oral revision to\r\nthe draft resolution he introduced earlier in this\r\nmeeting.\r\nMr. Gomaa (Egypt): I am taking the floor on\r\nbehalf of the sponsors of draft resolution A/55/L.12 in\r\norder to introduce a correction to it before the General\r\nAssembly acts on it.\r\nAs the item on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee is a biennial one, it should be included on\r\nthe agenda of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. Therefore, I would like to draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to paragraph 7, the last paragraph\r\nof the draft resolution. The reference in that paragraph\r\nto the fifty-sixth session, should in fact read “the fifty-\r\nseventh session”.\r\nThe President: Before proceeding to take action\r\non the draft resolution, I should like to announce that\r\nsince the introduction of draft resolution A/55/L.12,\r\nJapan and Sri Lanka have become co-sponsors.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/55/L.12, as orally revised.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/55/L.12, as orally revised?\r\nDraft resolution A/55/L.12, as orally revised, was\r\nadopted (resolution 55/4).\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 22?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work\r\nLetter from the Chairman of the Committee\r\non Conferences (A/55/312/Add.1)\r\nThe President: As members are aware, the\r\nAssembly, in section I, paragraph 7 of its resolution\r\n40/243, decided that no subsidiary organ of the General\r\nAssembly may meet at United Nations Headquarters\r\nduring a regular session of the Assembly unless\r\nexplicitly authorized by the Assembly.\r\nAs indicated in document A/55/312/Add.1, the\r\nCommittee on Conferences has recommended that the\r\nAssembly authorize the Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations and its Working Group to\r\nmeet in New York during the main part of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly adopts this\r\nrecommendation of the Committee on Conferences?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 174\r\nThe role of the United Nations in promoting a new\r\nglobal human order\r\nDraft resolution (A/55/L.15)\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): It is my honour to\r\ninitiate this morning, upon the instructions of my\r\nGovernment, a discussion of agenda item 174, relating\r\nto the role of the United Nations in promoting a new\r\nglobal human order. As delegations will have gathered\r\nfrom our past statements on this theme, as well as from\r\nthe information material which we have recently\r\ncirculated, the concept of such an order was the\r\nbrainchild of the late Mr. Cheddi Jagan, President of\r\nGuyana, who was inspired by a vision of the enormous\r\npotential for human development created by the end of\r\nthe cold war, the accelerated rate of technological\r\ndevelopment and the developing interdependence of\r\nnations. President Jagan believed that it was now\r\nopportune for the nations of the world to begin to build\r\na new and enlightened partnership based on mutual\r\nrespect, democratic governance and popular\r\nparticipation, and embodying — like any other\r\npartnership — the rights and obligations of the parties.\r\nI may add that this concept has already been endorsed\r\nby the heads of Government of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, by the Commonwealth heads of\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nGovernment, by the Rio Group, by the summit of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement held at Durban, South Africa,\r\nand by the Group of 77 summit held at Havana, Cuba.\r\nAnd now, committed to the promotion of the late\r\nPresident’s vision by the Government, my Government\r\nhas decided now to bring this proposal to the United\r\nNations so that it might enter the wider consciousness\r\nof the international community. In so doing, we have\r\nbeen prompted by the realization that over the past two\r\ndecades there has been a gradual but definite\r\ndisplacement of development from the international\r\npolicy agenda. That displacement has occurred\r\nprimarily in the context of two important and\r\ninterrelated developments, namely the ideological and\r\npolitical ascendancy of economic neo-liberalism, with\r\nits emphasis on the role of the market, and the\r\naccelerated pace of globalization, which has itself been\r\nincreasingly underpinned by a market-liberalizing\r\nlogic. We are of the view that the time has come for the\r\ninternational community to create an alternative vision\r\nfor development based on a more balanced relationship\r\nbetween the market and the State.\r\nIt may be useful for me first to say a few words\r\non the context and rationale of the proposal for this\r\nnew order. Why are we taking such an initiative when\r\nthere may already be others with a similar thrust? And\r\nindeed, there has been no dearth of plans to pursue\r\ndevelopment. Ever since its foundation in 1945, the\r\nUnited Nations has been labouring, decade after\r\ndecade, to devise an international strategy for\r\ndevelopment. And, decade after decade, these painfully\r\nnegotiated agreements have proved resistant to\r\nimplementation. We may also recall that, at the sixth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, we actually\r\nmanaged to forge a Declaration and a Programme of\r\nAction on the Establishment of a New International\r\nEconomic Order. And again in 1990, we succeeded in\r\nelaborating, after seemingly endless negotiations, the\r\nDeclaration on International Economic Cooperation, in\r\nparticular the Revitalization of Economic Growth and\r\nDevelopment of the Developing Countries.\r\nIt is fair to say that those documents fully\r\ncaptured, at least in their language, the aspirations of\r\nthe developing countries to economic and social\r\nprogress. Yet, as we know, they have all proved\r\ndisappointing in their results. Development continues\r\nto be a defiant will-o’-the-wisp, forever dancing before\r\nour eyes but always elusive.\r\nUndaunted by these failures, we have pursued\r\nother initiatives in the hope of better outcomes. Over\r\nthe decade of the 1990s we entered into a round of\r\nglobal summit conferences on most of the major issues\r\nof concern to the international community: children,\r\nenvironment and development, human rights, the\r\nsustainable development of small States, population\r\nand development, social development, women, human\r\nsettlements — and the list goes on. We also managed to\r\nput together, through sheer perseverance, a\r\ncomprehensive and cogent Agenda for Development to\r\nmatch the Agenda for Peace. Regrettably, these many\r\nefforts failed to yield the desired results, leaving us to\r\nwonder whether the game was worth the candle or\r\nwhether we are engaged in a mere charade. The\r\npeoples of the developing countries, I believe, are too\r\ntired and too poor to be forever playing games. And yet\r\nwe are about to embark upon the elaboration of another\r\ndevelopment strategy for the first decade of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nWe may very well wonder what can be achieved\r\nsince the reviews of the outcomes of some of the major\r\nconferences which have been held thus far do not augur\r\nwell for the future. As we ponder the reasons for our\r\nshortcomings, we invariably have to lament the chronic\r\nlack of the two elements that are required for progress,\r\nnamely political will and financial resources. We then\r\nbecome caught up in a spiral of mutual reproach and\r\nrecrimination. No one bothers to pursue the crucial\r\nquestions: How do we develop the necessary political\r\nwill, and how can we mobilize the needed resources?\r\nYet it is not only those shortcomings that raise\r\nquestions about the international negotiating process. It\r\nis also the realization that the new North-South/East-\r\nWest so-called consensus that has emerged in respect\r\nof development and governance, the roles of the State\r\nand of the market and sustainable environmentalism\r\nhas created the need for a new universal human order,\r\nbecause it has generated new social, economic and\r\npolitical problems, perhaps of an unintended character,\r\ncomplexity and magnitude. These are fomented by the\r\ncontradictions inherent in the consensus itself, and they\r\nclearly suggest the need for a fresh examination of the\r\npremises on which it is based.\r\nThere can therefore be no gainsaying the fact that\r\nbefore we can ever hope to have a breakthrough in\r\ndevelopment, these core questions of political will and\r\nresources must be resolved. The dialectic which\r\ncurrently divides Member States in both the philosophy\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nand the practice of development can hardly be expected\r\nto encourage a common approach to the very difficult\r\nchallenge that is the development agenda. An urgent\r\nreconciliation of the widely divergent views of the\r\npartners on world economic and social issues is a\r\nprerequisite for success in any future negotiations.\r\nThe first step in this process of reconciliation is\r\nclearly the resolution of the many dramatic\r\ncontradictions that have emerged in modern economic\r\nthinking. In the socio-economic sphere for example,\r\nthe ascendancy of economic liberalism has\r\nundoubtedly accentuated inequality at all levels: within\r\ncountries, both developed and developing, as well as\r\namong countries — North and South, East and West.\r\nIndividualism and materialism continue to be extolled\r\nat the expense of social and human values. And while\r\nthe international community says it is committed to the\r\nreduction of poverty, national and international policies\r\ndo not as yet reflect that commitment.\r\nIn absolute terms, the population living in poverty\r\nin both the South and the North is increasing.\r\nEconomic growth and unprecedented technological\r\nprogress and efficiency have been, ironically, the\r\nharbingers of greater unemployment and declining\r\nhuman welfare. Attempts at preserving the physical\r\nenvironment increasingly vitiate efforts to sustain\r\nhuman development.\r\nThe rhetoric of poverty reduction has all but\r\nsupplanted any real commitment to the higher ideal of\r\nhumanism. The much-touted “equality of opportunity”\r\nis proving to be no more than a mask for economic\r\nDarwinism. Moreover, the freedoms expected from\r\nhealthy competition under private enterprise are being\r\nrapidly restrained by the controlling hand of powerful\r\nconglomerates.\r\nIn the political arena, we cannot help but note\r\nthat the ascendancy of democracy often means not\r\ngreater popular participation and consensus but the rule\r\nof the powerful and its manipulation of the majority.\r\nDemocracy is increasingly becoming a cloak for\r\ngovernment by oligarchy, often going hand in hand\r\nwith the rise of racism and ethnic conflicts, fascist\r\nmovements, minority disaffirmation, regional\r\nfragmentation and strident nationalism. Though often\r\npractised at the national level, the virtues of democracy\r\nare still conspicuously absent in the wider community\r\nof nations, creating isolationism among the rich rather\r\nthan solidarity among humankind.\r\nNaturally, the proponents of globalization and\r\ntrade liberalization will argue differently. They are, of\r\ncourse, convinced that the free market will remedy the\r\nimbalance in economic growth between countries and\r\nthat as it swells, all boats will rise with the tide. Where\r\ndoes the truth lie? Let us look at the empirical\r\nevidence.\r\nYet another contradiction that bedevils\r\ninternational cooperation is that which persists between\r\nthe Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment. With the rapid proliferation of conflict in\r\nvarious parts of the world and the resulting increase in\r\npeacekeeping operations, there is a growing\r\npreoccupation among developing countries that with\r\nthe astronomical costs of implementing the Agenda for\r\nPeace, the Agenda for Development will be further\r\nstarved of resources. Clearly, a sensible balance has to\r\nbe struck between these two basic purposes of this\r\nOrganization. After all, as Pope John Paul II has said,\r\n“Peace is but another name for development”. New\r\napproaches must therefore be developed to strengthen\r\nthe indissoluble link between development and peace,\r\nso that they are made mutually reinforcing through a\r\ngreater investment in preventive, rather than\r\nenforcement, action.\r\nAs we can see, therefore, not only is there a wide\r\ndisparity in the economic and social conditions of the\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, but there is also\r\nan equally serious and more frightening difference in\r\ntheir perspectives on development policy. While we\r\nmay use the same words to refer to these challenges, it\r\nappears that often we do not mean the same things.\r\nGlobalization to many is the prescribed panacea for all\r\neconomic ills, while others see it as a threat of further\r\nmarginalization from the global economy.\r\nAnother buzzword which evokes different\r\nmeanings depending on who uses it is governance.\r\nComing from the North, governance smacks of\r\nconditionality to the South, which sees it more as good\r\ngovernment through capacity-building. Similarly\r\ndivisive are the fashionable labels of human rights,\r\nhuman security and humanitarian intervention, which,\r\nthough seemingly clear at first blush, develop sinister\r\nconnotations as the exchange proceeds. The list goes\r\non. Even the words “human order”, which we have\r\nused to describe this initiative, have been known in the\r\npast to be highly inflammatory. The mere mention of\r\nthese words was sufficient to produce a severe allergic\r\nreaction in some audiences, leading them to react\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nviolently against such concepts as the new international\r\neconomic order and the new international information\r\norder.\r\nHappily, it now appears that at the start of the\r\ntwenty-first century and this new millennium, there is a\r\ngreater tolerance for the word and concept of order.\r\nWitness the many statements heard at both the\r\nMillennium Summit and in the Millennium Assembly\r\ndebate, in which one often heard reference to the need\r\nfor a more enlightened global dispensation in this\r\nworld. More surprisingly, the calls for such an order\r\ncame not only from developing countries but also from\r\ndeveloped ones. All delegations will have seen, I hope,\r\nthe article in the International Herald Tribune of 7\r\nSeptember 2000 entitled “Progressive Equation:\r\nGlobalization and Welfare”, which featured a letter\r\nsigned by the leaders of four important European\r\nStates: the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden\r\nand Germany. In that public pronouncement, those\r\nheads of Government stated, inter alia:\r\n“We believe that there is an emerging consensus\r\non the right framework to build a global order\r\nbased on equal worth and social fairness … We\r\nare committed to a new international social\r\ncompact. We recognize that in an increasingly\r\ninterdependent world the aims of wider prosperity\r\nand a strengthening of civil society cannot be\r\npursued within the nation-state alone”.\r\nThey went on to state that\r\n“the key to development is to establish a virtuous\r\ncircle” — and here I underline the word\r\n“virtuous” — “between laudable aims that too\r\noften are pursued in isolation — debt relief,\r\nconflict prevention, trade, educational and health\r\ninvestment, environmental enhancement”.\r\nThese sentiments are certainly not dissimilar from\r\nthose embodied in our own proposal. Why then can we\r\nnot come together in this “Tower of Babel” that the\r\nUnited Nations is to agree on a common understanding\r\nand a common agenda for the United Nations? Why\r\ndoes the great political will which is often spoken of in\r\nthe Assembly and elsewhere not descend into the first\r\nbasement? Perhaps we should meet here a little more\r\noften.\r\nThe second most frequently asked question is,\r\n“What is this new global human order? What is it all\r\nabout?” Having been in this house longer than most, I\r\nknow that any new initiative, no matter how well\r\nintentioned, is suspect. Suspicion is, in fact, the single\r\nmost important impediment to agreement among\r\nnations. Yet it is a fair question which deserves an\r\nanswer. In attempting to provide one, I should perhaps\r\nfirst say what the proposal is not.\r\nContrary to what some may fear, it is not a call\r\nfor another United Nations talkfest. As we are all\r\npainfully aware, there are enough of these. It is instead\r\na serious and honest attempt to find common ground on\r\nwhich future international cooperation can be premised\r\nand to provide a comprehensive and holistic approach\r\nto development instead of the present ad hoc and\r\nscattershot manner in which we proceed. Furthermore,\r\nit is not intended to conflict with other initiatives and\r\nproposals already in existence and currently being\r\npursued. Rather, it should be considered as a\r\ncomplementary device for facilitating consensus.\r\nConceivably, it could also serve as a safety valve if or\r\nwhen, for whatever reason, the established negotiating\r\nprocesses flounder or fail.\r\nA quick reading of the documentation that was\r\ncirculated will, I hope, make it clear that the new\r\nglobal human order is not merely a philosophical\r\nconcept, but a practical agenda for development. One\r\nof its most interesting aspects is the proposal for a\r\nmodern and enhanced version of the Marshall Plan to\r\nassist developing countries to reach the threshold of\r\nself-reliant economic development and be able to enter\r\nthe global economy. In this regard, it is interesting to\r\nnote the sense of morality which appears to have\r\nmotivated the reconstruction of Europe after the\r\nSecond World War.\r\nIf we revisit the speech which the then Secretary\r\nof State Marshall made at Harvard University in June\r\n1947, we cannot fail to be impressed by his declared\r\naltruism. He said:\r\n“Our policy is directed not against any country or\r\ndoctrine but against hunger, poverty ... and chaos.\r\nIts purpose should be the revival of a working\r\neconomy in the world so as to permit the\r\nemergence of political and social conditions in\r\nwhich free institutions can exist. Such assistance,\r\nI am convinced, must not be on a piecemeal basis\r\nas various crises develop.”\r\nWould that today, when the world economy is again\r\nadrift with uncertainty, such progressive thinking could\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.39\r\nre-emerge, resulting in the equally bold measures that\r\nare needed to put it on the right course.\r\nI may add that the proposals mentioned in the\r\ndocuments are not exhaustive, but merely indicative.\r\nSeveral others have evolved from the wider discussions\r\nwhich have taken place since the concept of the new\r\nglobal human order was first introduced. Obviously,\r\nalthough by no means novel, many of these ideas can\r\nbe implemented only if they command general\r\nconsensus. We are therefore not propounding them for\r\nconsideration at this stage. As I said at the outset, our\r\nmain objective now is simply to initiate a dialogue\r\naimed at securing a reconciliation of the many\r\ndivergent views on development that prevent progress\r\nso that we might be able to develop a shared vision and\r\nstrategy for the future.\r\nThat brings me to the third question that may\r\nlegitimately be asked: how do we do this? How do we\r\nfind the political will to energize our efforts to create a\r\nnew development paradigm for the twenty-first\r\ncentury? My delegation is currently in the process of\r\nnegotiating a draft resolution that will outline a clear\r\nset of procedures designed to promote wide-ranging\r\nconsultations among the various developing partners to\r\nexplore the outer limits to which they are prepared to\r\ngo in development cooperation.  Hopefully, such a\r\ndialogue could establish the basic terms and conditions\r\nof the new partnership and at the same time provide a\r\ncertain degree of predictability and reliability in our\r\ncooperation.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the best forum for\r\nundertaking such an enterprise is the United Nations.\r\nAccepted as the most representative of international\r\ninstitutions, the United Nations is ideally suited to\r\npromoting agreement among Member States.\r\nMoreover, the Secretariat is well equipped to provide\r\nthe necessary intellectual support for the development\r\nof these initiatives. Member States, however, cannot\r\ndelegate or escape responsibility for determining the\r\nuses to which the Organization must be put or for\r\ndeciding how it should be geared to perform these\r\nfunctions. Too often — for example, in the attempt to\r\nreform the Security Council — we make the mistake of\r\ntrying to shape the institutions before agreeing upon\r\nwhat we wish them to do. The result, not surprisingly,\r\nis that very often we put the cart before the horse.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that the lineaments of\r\nthis new global human order already exist in the United\r\nNations Charter. We need only to build on this\r\nstructure to ensure that the Organization works in the\r\nmanner intended. My delegation is not naïve or foolish\r\nenough to believe that this proposed order can come\r\ninto existence overnight. Its creation will require not\r\nonly strong political commitment to the principles and\r\npurposes of multilateralism, but also dedication and\r\npatience in translating them into reality. We believe,\r\nhowever, like the Chinese people, that the longest\r\njourney begins with the first step. We are therefore\r\ncontent today to take merely the first step.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nBefore proceeding to the next item, I would like\r\nto announce some additions to the programme of work\r\nof the General Assembly. I would like to inform\r\nMembers that on Thursday morning, 26 October 2000,\r\nthe General Assembly will take up agenda item 16 (c),\r\nentitled “Election of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees” as the second item. The\r\nGeneral Assembly will also resume consideration of\r\nagenda item 31, entitled “Elimination of coercive\r\neconomic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion” as the fourth item for action,\r\ndraft resolution A/55/L.9/Rev.1.\r\nNext week, on Monday morning, 30 October\r\n2000, the General Assembly will take up agenda item\r\n183, entitled “Peace, security and reunification on the\r\nKorean peninsula” as the fifth item. The list of\r\nspeakers for item 183 is now open.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
