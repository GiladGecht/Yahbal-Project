(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 34\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/55/61,\r\nA/55/386)\r\nReport on the work of the United Nations \r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process\r\non Oceans and the Law of the Sea at its first \r\nmeeting (A/55/274)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/55/L.10, A/55/L.11)\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the New Zealand to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/55/L.10.\r\nMs. Hallum (New Zealand): I have the honour,\r\nas one of the coordinators, to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/55/L.10, entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”.\r\nThe other draft resolution, which comes under item\r\n34 (b), is entitled “Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing,\r\nunauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction\r\nand on the high seas, fisheries by-catch and discards,\r\nand other developments”. It will be introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of the United States.\r\nSince the publication of the draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Belize,\r\nCape Verde, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Grenada,\r\nIndia, Mozambique, Poland, the Russian Federation,\r\nSao Tome and Principe, South Africa and Spain.\r\nAt the outset I would like to make two technical\r\ncorrections to return the text to the wording I submitted\r\nfor publication, following the conclusion of the open-\r\nended consultations. First, in the second line of the\r\ntenth preambular paragraph the words “on Oceans and\r\nthe Law of the Sea” should be deleted. The second\r\nadjustment relates to footnotes 7 and 14. Footnote 7\r\nshould read: “Terms of reference are annexed to the\r\npresent resolution in annex I”. Footnote 14 should\r\nread: “Terms of reference are annexed to the present\r\nresolution in annex II”.\r\nThe draft resolution represents the key tangible\r\nproduct of the General Assembly’s ongoing\r\ncommitment to undertake an annual review and\r\nevaluation of the implementation of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and other\r\ndevelopments in ocean affairs and the law of the sea. It\r\nis the result of a substantial series of open-ended\r\nconsultations amongst delegations. I would like to\r\nexpress my appreciation to all delegations for their\r\nactive participation and constructive spirit, and in\r\nparticular to thank Ms. Alison Drayton of Guyana for\r\nacting as co-facilitator of the informal consultations. I\r\nwould also like to thank the staff of the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of\r\nLegal Affairs for their highly competent assistance,\r\nwhich, as always, was invaluable for our work.\r\nThe draft resolution’s preambular part underlines\r\na number of fundamental concepts, including the\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nuniversal and unified character of the Convention; its\r\nrole as legal framework for all activities in the oceans\r\nand seas and as a basis for action at the national,\r\nregional and global levels; the interrelatedness of all\r\noceans issues and the need to address all aspects in an\r\nintegrated manner; and the importance of oceans and\r\nseas to the earth’s ecosystem and for food security. The\r\npreambular part also touches upon a number of\r\nimportant current issues, such as the need for capacity-\r\nbuilding for the implementation of the Convention; the\r\nproblems of illegal, unreported and unregulated\r\nfishing; the degradation of the marine environment\r\nboth from land-based sources and pollution from ships;\r\nand crimes at sea.\r\nFirst and foremost, in order to achieve the goal of\r\nuniversal participation, the draft resolution calls on all\r\nStates that have not done so to ratify and implement the\r\nConvention and the Agreement, and urges assistance\r\nfor developing countries in this regard. The operative\r\npart of the text contains a number of other important\r\nrecommendations, decisions and requests, reflecting\r\nthe range of issues covered by the Secretary-General’s\r\nannual comprehensive report on oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea. This year, for the first time, the General\r\nAssembly has had the benefit of the input of the Open-\r\nended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nthe Law of the Sea. A significant number of elements\r\nin the draft resolution draw on recommendations from\r\nthe first meeting of this process.\r\nThe draft resolution refers in very positive terms\r\nto the ongoing work of the three institutions\r\nestablished under the Convention: the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, the International\r\nSeabed Authority and the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf. In the case of the Seabed\r\nAuthority, the draft resolution welcomes the adoption\r\nof the mining code, an important milestone for the\r\nAuthority, and notes with satisfaction that the\r\nAuthority is now in a position to proceed to issue\r\ncontracts to the registered pioneer investors. The draft\r\nresolution also notes the considerable progress in the\r\nwork of the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, in particular the open meeting held\r\nearlier this year and the work the Commission has been\r\ndoing on developing a training course on the\r\npreparation of submissions.\r\nDrawing on recommendations made by the\r\nConsultative Process, the draft resolution addresses the\r\nissue of capacity-building for the implementation of\r\nthe Convention and the sustainable development of the\r\noceans and seas and their resources, calling on bilateral\r\nand multilateral donors and the Secretary-General, in\r\ncooperation with competent international\r\norganizations, to review their efforts in this area. It\r\nfurther asks the Secretary-General to include a section\r\non this subject in his annual report on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea.\r\nThe draft resolution urges States to continue the\r\ndevelopment of an international plan of action to\r\ncombat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing as a\r\nmatter of priority, and in this context recognize the\r\ncentral role that regional and subregional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations will have in addressing this\r\nissue. This issue is, of course, further taken up in the\r\ndraft resolution to be adopted under agenda item\r\n34 (b).\r\nOn the issue of marine pollution, the importance\r\nof the full implementation of the Global Programme of\r\nAction for the Protection of the Marine Environment\r\nfrom Land-based Activities is emphasized. States are\r\ncalled upon to prioritize action on marine pollution and\r\nto do so in an integrated and inclusive manner. The\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme and the World\r\nBank are invited to consider what support is needed to\r\novercome the obstacles to the preparation and\r\nimplementation of national and local action\r\nprogrammes. The draft resolution also emphasizes the\r\nimportance of ensuring that adverse impacts on the\r\nmarine environment are taken into account when\r\nassessing and evaluating development programmes and\r\nprojects. On the issue of pollution from ships, the draft\r\nresolution urges States to take all practicable steps in\r\naccordance with the relevant international instruments.\r\nThe draft resolution stresses the need for the\r\ninternational community to consider the issues of\r\nmarine science and how best to implement the\r\nobligations of States and competent international\r\norganizations under parts XIII and XIV of the\r\nConvention. Perhaps as a starting point for this\r\nconsideration, the draft resolution recommends issues\r\nof marine science — and the development and transfer\r\nof marine technology — as an area of focus for the\r\nnext meeting of the Consultative Process in May 2001.\r\nAs in previous years, the draft resolution contains\r\nreferences to the problems of piracy and armed robbery\r\nat sea and to the ongoing work in the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nunderwater cultural heritage. Coordination and\r\ncooperation in combating piracy and armed robbery at\r\nsea are also recommended as an area of focus for next\r\nyear’s meeting of the Consultative Process.\r\nFinally, the draft resolution establishes a number\r\nof voluntary trust funds to assist developing countries\r\nand developing country representatives in various\r\nmatters relating to oceans and the law of the sea. In the\r\ncase of two of these funds — the fund to assist States\r\nin the settlement of disputes through the Tribunal and\r\nthe fund to provide training to assist developing States\r\nwith issues relating to the preparation of submissions\r\nto the Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf — terms of reference are annexed to assist the\r\nSecretary-General in their administration.\r\nWhile it would have been my preference to\r\ncommend this draft resolution for adoption by\r\nconsensus, I understand that this will not be possible,\r\nas it has become customary for one delegation to\r\nrequest a vote.\r\nAllow me now to make some comments on behalf\r\nof my own country, New Zealand. Clearly, the oceans\r\nand seas are a genuine and long-standing preoccupation\r\nfor my delegation. All countries have their own\r\ncreation myths and stories and, in New Zealand’s case,\r\nthis account demonstrates the centrality of the oceans\r\nand their resources to our way of thinking. New\r\nZealand is made of three islands – two large and one\r\nsmall – and one of the accounts of its creation goes as\r\nfollows: Maui, a demigod, was fishing in his canoe and\r\npulled up the largest fish he had ever caught. The fish\r\nstruggled, but Maui fought fiercely and pounded the\r\nfish with his greenstone mere. Te-ika-a-Maui, the fish\r\nof Maui, became the north island of New Zealand, with\r\nthe blows of his club forming the mountains and ranges\r\nVisible today. His canoe, Te-waka-a-Maui, become the\r\nsouth island, while the third and smallest island,\r\nStewart Island, is the canoe’s anchor stone.\r\nAs we look at the broad spectrum of issues\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report and\r\nreflected in the draft resolutions to be adopted under\r\nthis item, it is more apparent than ever that the\r\nproblems of oceans and seas are interrelated and need\r\nto be considered as a whole. This principle is at the\r\nheart of the Convention and the same integrated\r\napproach needs to be taken to the implementation of\r\nthe Convention and to the activities carried out within\r\nits framework.\r\nAs Ambassador Satya Nandan said two years ago\r\nin this Assembly, the establishment of the rule of law,\r\nalbeit a major achievement, is not an end in itself, but\r\nrather a means to a more orderly and rational use of the\r\noceans and their resources. We believe that the General\r\nAssembly has an important role in contributing to this\r\nend by maintaining oversight of the complex network\r\nof processes, organizations and responsibilities\r\nestablished by the Convention and ensuring that these\r\nactivities take place in a way that accords with the\r\noverall balance achieved in the Convention.\r\nWe welcomed the establishment last year of the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea and\r\nthe holding of its first meeting in May of this year. My\r\ndelegation would like to pay a tribute to the dedicated\r\nefforts of the co-Chairmen, Ambassador Neroni Slade\r\nand Mr. Alan Simcock, in ensuring the success of the\r\nfirst meeting of the Consultative Process. We consider\r\nthat the output of the Consultative Process has clearly\r\nenriched the informal consultations under this item and\r\nthe resolutions to be adopted, and hopefully will now\r\nenrich the debate that we are to have today.\r\nOur views will be incorporated in the Pacific\r\nGroup statement being delivered later today by the\r\nAmbassador of Tonga, so at this stage I will confine\r\nmyself to a few key issues of particular importance to\r\nmy delegation. As we look at developments over recent\r\nyears, we are encouraged that much of the work\r\nenvisaged in the Convention is under way and that in\r\nmany areas there is considerable progress. The\r\nConvention is really starting to work and breathe.\r\nThe United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement has\r\nyet to enter into force, but with two recent ratifications\r\nfrom Barbados and Luxembourg, only two further\r\nratifications are lacking, so entry into force is not far\r\naway. In the area of marine living resources, a number\r\nof regions have gone ahead to conclude third-\r\ngeneration agreements establishing regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations envisaged in the United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement. One of these regions\r\nis the Pacific, where we are pleased, after years of hard\r\nwork, to have adopted the Western and Central Pacific\r\nFisheries Convention. We consider that this\r\nConvention represents a fair balance between the rights\r\nand interests of coastal States and fishing nations, and\r\nhope that all countries will work together for the early\r\nentry into force of the Convention and to ensure that a\r\nsolid foundation for the eventual work of the\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\ncommission established under this Convention is laid\r\nthrough the preparatory-conference process.\r\nThe problem of illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing is finally getting the attention it\r\ndeserves, although unfortunately the October\r\nconsultations in the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\nof the United Nations (FAO) fell short of completing\r\nthe urgently needed international plan of action. All\r\nStates need to take action to ensure that the activities of\r\ntheir nationals do not undermine the conservation and\r\nmanagement measures agreed upon by regional\r\nfisheries management organizations. It is essential that\r\nFAO adopt a comprehensive approach to ensure that all\r\nStates that can have a role in deterring illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing do in fact take up\r\nthe challenge. This includes coastal States, port States\r\nand those States whose nationals and companies, as\r\nwell as vessels, fish on the high seas and in other\r\ncountries’ waters. This also means encouraging States\r\nto ensure that their nationals do not resort to reflagging\r\nto deliberately avoid conservation and management\r\nmeasures.\r\nTurning now to non-living marine resources, we\r\nwere very pleased that the International Seabed\r\nAuthority has adopted the regulations on prospecting\r\nand exploration for polymetallic nodules in the Area.\r\nWe are pleased that these regulations require that a\r\nprecautionary approach be applied to activities in the\r\nArea to ensure effective protection of the marine\r\nenvironment. We look forward to the early conclusion\r\nof contracts for exploration between the Authority and\r\nthe registered pioneer investors in accordance with\r\nthose regulations.\r\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf has also made considerable progress in its work\r\nand will soon begin to receive submissions from States.\r\nWe welcomed very much the first open meeting of the\r\nCommission held earlier this year and consider that this\r\nmeeting filled a very important function in\r\nfamiliarizing States with what is involved in preparing\r\na submission. In our own case, we are currently\r\nworking towards making our submission within the 10-\r\nyear time-frame set down in the Convention.\r\nWe look forward to a constructive debate and to\r\nparticipating over the coming year in the many\r\nactivities that are taking place within the framework of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of the\r\nUnited States of America to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/55/L.11.\r\nMr. Carmichael (United States of America):  My\r\ndelegation has the honour to co-sponsor the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea” in\r\ndocument A/55/L.10. We also have the honour to\r\nintroduce, on behalf of the sponsors, the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Large-scale pelagic drift-net\r\nfishing, unauthorized fishing in zones of national\r\njurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries by-catch and\r\ndiscards, and other developments”, in document\r\nA/55/L.11.\r\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to all those\r\ndelegations that participated, and especially the\r\ndelegations of New Zealand, Guyana and Argentina.\r\nThey guided the discussions, offering valuable\r\nsuggestions and advice as we worked together in a\r\nspirit of cooperation to draft these two texts.\r\nWe would also like to note that this year’s\r\nfisheries resolution negotiations were attended by a\r\nsignificantly larger number of delegations than in\r\nrecent years. We believe that this is reflective of the\r\ntimely and important work that we are undertaking and\r\nunderscores the importance of a balanced resolution\r\nthat takes into account the priorities and problems\r\nfacing the global community in achieving sustainable\r\nfisheries.\r\nThe United States believes that the draft\r\nresolution on fisheries before us today represents a\r\nsuccessful merger of various regional and global\r\npriorities into a useful document that we sincerely hope\r\nthe international community will fully endorse.\r\nIn the past several years, the international\r\ncommunity has placed major emphasis on sustainable\r\nfisheries at both the governmental and\r\nintergovernmental levels. In 1999, the Committee on\r\nFisheries (COFI) of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) endorsed\r\nthree International Plans of Action for the management\r\nof fishing capacity, for the conservation and\r\nmanagement of sharks, and for reducing incidental\r\ncatch of seabirds in longline fisheries. The United\r\nStates welcomes their adoption and urges all countries\r\nto actively implement these important International\r\nPlans of Action in accordance with the timetables set\r\nforth in the plans.\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nIn addition, this year the FAO’s Committee on\r\nFisheries made important progress in addressing the\r\nglobal problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated\r\nfishing, which undermines international and national\r\nefforts to conserve and manage fisheries resources. The\r\nUnited States strongly supports the FAO Committee’s\r\ninitiative to develop a comprehensive international plan\r\nof action to prevent, deter and eliminate this activity,\r\nand we have been participating actively in its\r\ndevelopment. We also wish to applaud the cooperation\r\nbetween the FAO and other United Nations bodies,\r\nsuch as the International Labour Organization and the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization, to combat this\r\nurgent problem.\r\nWe welcome the conclusion of negotiations to\r\nestablish new regional fisheries management\r\norganizations in the Central and Western Pacific and\r\nthe Southeast Atlantic Oceans. We would especially\r\nlike to congratulate all those who participated in the\r\nadoption of the Convention on the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the\r\nWestern and Central Pacific Ocean. This Convention\r\nestablishes an effective system for conservation and\r\nlong-term sustainability of the highly migratory species\r\nof the region. This region produces more than half of\r\nthe world’s annual tuna catch, which is often the only\r\nsignificant natural resource for small island developing\r\nStates and island communities.\r\nMarine pollution and the level of by-catch and\r\ndiscards in some commercial fisheries threaten the\r\nhealth of the marine ecosystem and the achievement of\r\nsustainable fisheries. Marine pollution and debris, from\r\nboth land-generated and vessel-generated sources, can\r\nsignificantly affect the marine and coastal environment,\r\ncommercial and artisanal fisheries, the tourism industry\r\nand navigational safety. Although there are\r\ninternational agreements that regulate marine pollution,\r\nmore coordination is needed among all the relevant\r\nintergovernmental bodies, regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations, industry and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to effectively address this\r\ncomplex problem at both the global and regional levels.\r\nIn this regard, I note that it has been nearly a\r\ndecade since the General Assembly unanimously\r\nadopted the resolution calling for the phase-out of all\r\nhigh seas drift-nets by 1992. Globally, we have made\r\nsignificant progress towards achieving this goal. Yet\r\nsome illegal drift-netting with oversized nets continues.\r\nTo end this hazardous fishery practice once and for all,\r\ncountries must enforce fully General Assembly\r\nresolution 46/125 by calling for their relevant national\r\nauthorities to confiscate and destroy illegal nets,\r\nimpose fines significant enough to deter illegal drift-\r\nnetting and, finally, to maintain a strong monitoring\r\nsystem.\r\nThe United States believes that nations took\r\npositive steps towards improved coordination and\r\ncooperation on matters relating to oceans and seas\r\nthrough the Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe full General Assembly review and debate,\r\npresaged in the clear language of Agenda 21, is more\r\ninformed, and the Secretary-General’s report on oceans\r\nhas become more meaningful and useful. Governments,\r\nintergovernmental organizations and major groups that\r\ntake a keen interest in our work are all benefiting from\r\nthis process. The informal process increases our\r\ncontacts on ocean and coastal matters across\r\nGovernments and ministries and widens the\r\npossibilities for future cooperation. We welcome the\r\nestablishment of a trust fund to encourage greater\r\nparticipation of experts from all Member States in this\r\nprocess.\r\nWe believe that the international community\r\nbenefited greatly from the discussion last May on\r\nprotection of the marine environment from land-based\r\nactivities. We must continue to look for opportunities\r\nto implement the Global Programme of Action. The\r\nupcoming review in 2001 provides such an opportunity.\r\nWe also urge all to actively implement paragraphs 25\r\nthrough 30 of the draft resolution before us.\r\nNext year we will discuss marine science and\r\npiracy in the Informal Consultative Process. The\r\nmarine science review will give us a chance to take a\r\nlook at the science and technological sections set forth\r\nin chapter 17 of Agenda 21 to determine how much\r\nfurther we need to go to meet those goals. The piracy\r\nreview is very timely and is particularly important to\r\ngalvanize the further advancement of productive\r\nmeasures to address this serious threat to our seafarers,\r\nour oceans and our seas.\r\nOn the issue of marine science, we can think of\r\nmany questions that should be reviewed. For instance,\r\nhow can we better understand the coupled\r\nocean/atmosphere system? How can we encourage the\r\nstorage, archiving, analysis and full and open sharing\r\nof data and information resulting from scientific\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nresearch on and monitoring of the marine environment?\r\nHow can we improve the linkages of training\r\nopportunities with the regional environmental\r\norganizations?\r\nWhat is the best way to ensure support for the\r\nimplementation of the global ocean observing system?\r\nHow can we best effect the coordination and\r\nintegration of national and international programmes of\r\nscientific research on and long-term observations of the\r\nmarine environment to take maximum advantage of the\r\ndata and information necessary for understanding the\r\noceans? How can we ensure the development of\r\nstandards, procedures, methods and measuring\r\ntechniques to ensure the comparability and\r\ncompatibility of data and information? How can we\r\npromote the integrated and sustained observing\r\nsystems, in particular the establishment of the Argo\r\nglobal array of profiling floats, a prototype element of\r\nthe global ocean observing system?\r\nHow do we link cross-cutting issues, such as\r\nhuman health, seafood safety, capacity-building,\r\nsustainable fisheries and the role of the ocean in\r\nclimate with existing marine science and operational\r\nprogrammes and national and regional plans of action\r\non land-based sources of pollution to the marine\r\nenvironment? How can we achieve the linkages and\r\ncollaboration among the various international\r\norganizations and institutions, including the United\r\nNations system and international financial institutions,\r\nnecessary to provide marine scientific information to\r\ndecision-makers?\r\nThe United States also shares the concerns\r\nexpressed in this draft resolution for the need to\r\ncooperate to suppress acts of piracy and armed robbery\r\nat sea. We welcome the call for wider ratification and\r\neffective implementation of the Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of\r\nMaritime Navigation and its Protocol. We believe this\r\nwill provide an international legal basis for cooperation\r\nin the apprehension and prosecution of these criminals.\r\nThe United States wants to express its long-\r\nstanding support for the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. The United States\r\ncontinues to pursue ratification with the goal of\r\nbecoming a party to the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea and the Agreement relating to the Implementation\r\nof Part XI.\r\nWe support the call in the draft resolution for\r\nStates to harmonize as a matter of priority their\r\nnational legislation with the provisions of the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. Consistency would\r\nalso be advanced — and this is in the interests of all —\r\nby the withdrawal of declarations and statements that\r\nare not in conformity with the Convention.\r\nConcurrent with this idea of consistency is the\r\nongoing work towards the development of a draft\r\nconvention relating to underwater cultural heritage.\r\nSuch a convention must be in full conformity with the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea.\r\nWe believe that the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf can be a force for stability in\r\nocean space. Essential elements of that stability include\r\na cautious approach to thorny issues in the\r\nestablishment of the outer limit of the continental shelf;\r\nthe possibility of appropriate assistance to developing\r\nStates, in particular the least-developed countries and\r\nsmall island developing States; a strict approach to\r\nensuring confidentiality and an unvarying commitment\r\nto refrain from any actions which reflect negatively on\r\nthe Commission or the Commissioners. In this regard,\r\nwe support the terms of reference regarding the\r\nvoluntary trust fund relating to the Commission and\r\nnote the statement of the Chairman of the Commission\r\nof September 2000.\r\nIn summary, the United States objectives continue\r\nto be the promotion of widespread adherence to, and\r\nimplementation of, the provisions of the Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the 1994 Agreement;\r\nimplementation of the Convention and the Agreement\r\nin a cost-effective manner with budgets held to the\r\nminimum; and the entry into force of the Agreement on\r\nfish stocks and the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\nCompliance Agreement.\r\nThe President: Before calling on the next\r\nspeaker I should like to inform members that, owing to\r\nthe large number of speakers inscribed in the debate on\r\nagenda item 34, the General Assembly will not be able\r\nto hear all the speakers this afternoon and will\r\ntherefore hear the remaining speakers tomorrow,\r\nFriday, 27 October, at 3 p.m. with a view to concluding\r\nconsideration of this item.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme first of all to express the thanks of my delegation to\r\nMs. Alison Drayton of the Republic of Guyana and to\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nMs. Victoria Hallum of New Zealand for their\r\nenlightened conduct of the consultations on the draft\r\nresolution relating to oceans and the law of the sea that\r\nhas just been presented and which the Principality of\r\nMonaco, as in previous sessions, has joined in\r\nsponsoring.\r\nMy delegation was among those which sponsored\r\nresolution 54/33 on the basis of which the General\r\nAssembly decided to set up the informal consultation\r\nprocess open to everybody on oceans and the law of the\r\nsea.\r\nThe first meeting showed to what extent we need\r\nto make maximum use of an integrated approach to all\r\naspects — legal, economic, social, environmental and\r\nothers — relating to oceans and the seas, and to\r\nimproved coordination at the inter-governmental, inter-\r\ninstitutional levels, as well as at the regional,\r\nsubregional and local levels, and thus enable the\r\nparticipation of the main groups identified in\r\nAgenda 21.\r\nThe success of these initial consultations is due\r\nprimarily to the co-Presidents, Ambassador Slade of\r\nSamoa and Mr. Simcock of the United Kingdom — and\r\nwe are very happy to see the extension of their\r\nmandate — and also to the Division for Ocean Affairs\r\nand the Law of the Sea. Their competence and their\r\neffective and well-advised conduct of the work and the\r\nconstructive approach of the participating delegations\r\nenabled the first meeting to be a resounding success.\r\nThe results and the usefulness of the informal\r\nprocess will be evaluated at the fifty-seventh session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Nevertheless, and without\r\nprejudice to discussions that will take place in two\r\nyears, I would like to reaffirm the support of my\r\ndelegation to this initiative which enables the General\r\nAssembly to better fulfil its annual mandate to examine\r\nand analyse ocean affairs and the law of the sea.\r\nAs we have seen, a few hours of formal meeting\r\nin the Assembly is not sufficient to enable us to pay\r\ndue attention to the question of ocean affairs, and, in\r\nparticular, to the areas where coordination and\r\ncooperation must be strengthened.\r\nIn saying this, we must draw attention to the\r\nincrease in work faced by the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea and the Assembly must\r\ndraw the necessary conclusions and enable the Division\r\nto continue its excellent work.\r\nIn this context, it would also seem to be essential\r\nto ensure effective participation of the developing\r\ncountries in this process and, particularly, the\r\nparticipation of the least-developed countries, the\r\nsmall-island States as well as coastal States.\r\nThe Principality has always been a firm defender\r\nof the protection of the marine environment and its\r\nresources. This is an indissociable part of preserving\r\nthe earth’s ecosystem.\r\nThe fact that our small country is so open to the\r\nMediterranean fully justifies its involvement in matters\r\nof regional and subregional cooperation and our action\r\nto promote sustainable management of the oceans, the\r\nseas and their resources and, in particular, the coastal\r\nareas, which are the most vulnerable because of the\r\nhigh density of population living there.\r\nIn this connection I would like to mention the\r\nrecent events in which my country has been involved.\r\nFirst, regarding the fight against pollution. At the\r\nbeginning of this month, within the framework of the\r\nRAMOGE agreement and its anti-pollution plan,\r\ncooperation was established between Italy, France and\r\nMonaco for the protection of the marine and coastal\r\nenvironment, following which the first simulation\r\nexercise took place aimed at fighting pollution around\r\nthe port of Genoa in Italy. Representatives of the\r\nEuropean Economic Commission and the\r\nMediterranean Action Plan took part in this exercise,\r\nwhose aim was to measure the effectiveness of\r\nintervention measures in cases of accidental oil spills\r\nfrom tankers.\r\nFrom 6 to 11 November, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, the third\r\nglobal meeting on regional seas conventions and action\r\nplans will take place. This meeting, organized by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Marine\r\nEnvironment Laboratory, whose Headquarters is\r\nsituated in the Principality, will enable us to promote\r\ncooperation between the bodies created by these\r\nConventions and Action Plans for the implementation\r\nof the Global Programme of Action for the Protection\r\nof the Marine Environment from Land-based\r\nActivities. Experts from some 20 United Nations\r\nagencies will also study the strengthening of the links\r\nbetween the programme relating to regional seas and\r\nother conventions and agreements, such as the\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on\r\nInternational Trade in Endangered Species, the\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nConvention on the Conservation of Migratory Species,\r\nthe Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the Basle\r\nConvention on hazardous wastes. My country hopes\r\nthat this will also be the opportunity to give a new\r\nstimulus to the Global Plan of Action for the\r\nConservation, Management and Utilization of Marine\r\nMammals. From 14 to 17 November, in Tunis, the\r\nMediterranean Commission for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, of which Monaco is a member, will\r\nappraise the state of the Mediterranean environment as\r\na whole.\r\nWith regard to the protection of marine resources,\r\nthe parties to the agreement between France, Italy and\r\nMonaco for the protection of marine mammals, signed\r\nat Rome on 25 November 1999, met on 19 October to\r\njointly begin scientific and technical work and to\r\nprepare the management structures for the planned\r\nsanctuary, ready for when the agreement enters into\r\nforce. A scientific and technical committee will be\r\nestablished to assist the three Governments apply\r\nscientific knowledge to conservation, raising public\r\nawareness and communication activities, as well as the\r\nimpact of human activities, such as tourism, fishing\r\nand sailing and boating, particularly involving\r\nspeedboats and racing.\r\nFinally, the Principality has offered to\r\naccommodate the Secretariat of the Agreement on the\r\nConservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea,\r\nMediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area,\r\nwhich will enter into force when another\r\nMediterranean country deposits its instrument of\r\nratification.\r\nThe Monaco Scientific Research Centre has\r\nbegun, just a few days ago, to produce a map of the\r\nMediterranean coastal area stretching from the French\r\ntown of Toulon to the Italian border. Thanks to\r\nmultispectral remote sensing, we have been able to\r\ndraw up a positive balance sheet of this over-built area,\r\nwhich is also over-populated in summer. The presence\r\nof several habitats of posidonia, a plant which plays a\r\nvital role in the Mediterranean ecosystem, was\r\nparticularly revealing. It shows that efforts with regard\r\nto the treatment of liquid waste and raising the\r\nconsciousness of populations and yachts-people must\r\nbe pursued.\r\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing must\r\nreceive priority attention, because of its dangerous\r\nimpact both on the management and sustainable\r\nexploitation of marine resources and on the economies\r\nof a number of countries. We hope that the plan of\r\naction of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations, to be presented to its Committee on\r\nFisheries at the Committee’s twenty-fourth session in\r\nFebruary 2001, can be examined and adopted quickly.\r\nRecognition of the flag State’s responsibility is, in our\r\nview, of prime importance.\r\nCooperation and coordination are also vital if we\r\nwish to stop the increasing, serious acts of piracy and\r\narmed theft that are unfortunately experienced by\r\nvessels and sailors. Given that two thirds of reported\r\nincidents occur in seven geographical zones, regional\r\ncooperation between the most affected coastal States is\r\nessential. The International Maritime Organization,\r\nwhich established a working group to establish\r\nguidelines on this matter, has also drawn the\r\nAssembly’s attention to the assistance that other United\r\nNations bodies could give to this vital initiative. My\r\nGovernment, of course, favours this. The question\r\nshould be included on the agenda of the next meeting\r\nof the Informal Consultative Process, so that Member\r\nStates can consider the question and draw up concrete\r\nmeasures.\r\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf held a public meeting on 1 May 2000, at which\r\nwe were able to stress concerns about the difficulties a\r\nnumber of developing countries face in preparing\r\nsubmissions to establish the outer limits of their\r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, as set\r\nforth in article 4 of annex II to the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the attention paid to this delicate question in\r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to pay tribute to the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, whose Assembly\r\nadopted on 13 July 2000 the Regulations on\r\nProspecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules\r\nin the Area. A new era is about to begin that will offer\r\nthe Authority the opportunity to conclude contracts\r\nwith the pioneer investors in accordance with the\r\nConvention, the Agreement relating to the\r\nImplementation of Part XI and the regulations.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank the Authority’s\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Satya Nandan, for his tireless\r\nefforts and dedication.\r\nMr. Alabrune (France) (spoke in French): It is\r\nmy honour to speak on behalf of the European Union\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\non this agenda item “Oceans and the law of the sea”.\r\nThe Central and Eastern European countries associated\r\nwith the European Union — Bulgaria, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,\r\nRomania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the associated\r\ncountries Cyprus and Malta align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nThe preparation and subsequent entry into force\r\nof the Montego Bay Convention marked major\r\nprogress in strengthening international cooperation in\r\nmaritime matters. However, over and above the\r\ncontribution of this valuable legal instrument, there is\r\nan urgent need to informally strengthen this\r\ncooperation in order to protect the marine environment\r\nand avoid the risk of overexploitation of natural marine\r\nresources. That is why last year, on the\r\nrecommendation of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the General Assembly introduced in\r\nresolution 54/33 the Informal Consultative Process on\r\nOceans and the law of the Sea, which, through an\r\nintegrated approach to all pertinent aspects of ocean\r\naffairs, should facilitate the General Assembly’s yearly\r\nreview of developments in this area.\r\nThe first meeting of the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess was held in New York from 30 May to 2 June\r\n2000. Conducted in a spirit of consensus, with the\r\nparticipation of competent international agencies and\r\norganizations and representatives of civil society, its\r\nwork proved most fruitful. The European Union\r\nreaffirms its full support for the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess and fully endorses the recommendations of its\r\nreport. It emphasizes in particular the need to support\r\nthe fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated\r\nfishing and marine pollution.\r\nThe thoughts expressed during the Informal\r\nConsultative Process once again illustrated the\r\nrelevance of the legal framework provided by the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. By\r\ntheir very nature, questions connected with oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea require a broad approach. In this\r\nregard, the Montego Bay Convention remains a vital\r\nunderpinning of all the international community’s\r\nefforts in the areas of exploitation of the marine\r\nenvironment and the promotion of peace and security\r\non the high seas.\r\nIn view of the major role played by the\r\nConvention and by the Agreement relating to the\r\nimplementation of Part XI, the European Union\r\nstresses that it is the aim to secure universal accession\r\nto those two instruments, to which the European Union\r\nis party. We welcome the increase in the number of\r\nparties to those instruments, to 135 for the Convention\r\nand to 100 for the Agreement relating to the\r\nimplementation of Part XI. Because of their universal\r\ncharacter, the European Union calls for the inclusion of\r\nthe Convention and the Agreement in the Secretariat’s\r\nlist of major international instruments to be signed and\r\nratified as a matter of priority.\r\nAt the same time, we note with concern that some\r\nStates have acceded to the Convention and not to the\r\nAgreement relating to the implementation of Part XI.\r\nWe call upon those States to accede to the Agreement\r\nas soon as possible. Moreover, a number of States have\r\nmade statements that affect the legal scope of\r\nprovisions of the Convention. Article 309 of the\r\nConvention states that no reservations or exceptions\r\nmay be made to the Convention. The European Union\r\nthus stresses that such statements are without legal\r\nforce. Similarly, the espousal or introduction in the\r\nnational law of States parties or in international\r\nagreements of provisions that run counter to the\r\nConvention is unacceptable to us.\r\nWe believe also that the smooth functioning of\r\nbodies established under the Convention is crucial. The\r\nEuropean Union welcomes the fact that the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is now\r\noperational, and it welcomes the International Seabed\r\nAuthority’s adoption, after four years of work, of a\r\ndraft seabed mining code with respect to exploration\r\nand exploitation of the seabed.\r\nThe European Union stresses the vital importance\r\nof parties to the Convention paying their contributions\r\nto the Authority and to the Tribunal on time. Likewise,\r\nStates that are former provisional members of the\r\nAuthority should, where necessary, settle their debts.\r\nThis process of financial rationalization should be\r\naccompanied by a sustained effort by the Authority and\r\nthe Tribunal to control their operating costs. Here, the\r\nEuropean Union expresses its satisfaction with respect\r\nto the stabilization of the Authority’s budget at the end\r\nof its establishment phase. It is imperative also that the\r\njudgements of the Tribunal be promptly implemented\r\nby the parties concerned.\r\nThe European Union stresses the importance of\r\nthe new trust funds that would be established by the\r\nterms of draft resolution A/55/L.10, “Oceans and the\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nlaw of the sea”, especially those intended to assist\r\nStates with the settlement of disputes through the\r\nTribunal and to facilitate broad participation in the\r\ninformal consultative process. The United Kingdom, a\r\nmember of the European Union, has already decided to\r\ncontribute $10,000 to the Tribunal trust fund.\r\nThe European Union expresses its satisfaction\r\nwith draft resolution A/55/L.10, entitled “Oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea”, on which action will be taken at the\r\npresent session. We also join in congratulating Ms.\r\nAlison Drayton and Ms. Victoria Hallum, who\r\ncoordinated the preparation of the draft resolution. The\r\ntext takes into account the proposals formulated at the\r\nfirst meeting of the Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, designed, in\r\nparticular, to strengthen international cooperation and\r\ncoordination in ocean affairs with a view to ensuring\r\nsustainable use of the oceans.\r\nThe European Union further welcomes the fact\r\nthat the next meeting of the Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process will be devoted to marine science\r\nand technology transfers, relating in particular to\r\ncapacity-building. The European Union stresses the\r\nimportant role of marine science and technology in\r\npromoting the sustainable management and use of the\r\noceans, and it recognizes the need to address such\r\nquestions, especially in specific areas where\r\ninternational cooperation and coordination could be\r\nimproved, in accordance with parts XIII and XIV of the\r\nConvention, and with Agenda 21.\r\nIssues of maritime safety and security remain a\r\nmajor European Union concern. We note with concern\r\nthe increase in the number of often violent attacks on\r\nships. Here, we stress the great importance of the work\r\nthat the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has\r\nbeen doing for a number of years to combat piracy,\r\nwork which has given us a better understanding of the\r\nphenomenon and of how to deal with it. The European\r\nUnion thus renews its appeal to coastal States to\r\ncooperate among themselves and to take the necessary\r\nsteps, inter alia, to bring the perpetrators of such\r\nattacks to book. We further call on flag States and other\r\naffected States to ensure that shipping companies take\r\nfull account of the need to protect their vessels and\r\ncrews from such attacks. The European Union\r\nreaffirms its support for the efforts and initiatives of\r\nthe International Maritime Organization in that sphere,\r\nand calls upon Governments, especially those in areas\r\nthat are worst affected, to work with the IMO to\r\neradicate these crimes.\r\nThe European Union looks forward to the\r\nconsideration at the next meeting of the Informal\r\nConsultative Process of the issue of piracy and armed\r\nrobbery at sea. We hope for the broadest possible\r\nparticipation in the debate to help improve\r\nunderstanding of the full extent of the problem and of\r\nthe need for all States to do what is necessary to reduce\r\nthe number of these attacks.\r\nParticular sea routes are often preferred by\r\ntraffickers, particularly those who traffic in migrants.\r\nTo stop such trafficking, States members of the\r\nEuropean Union have been actively involved in the\r\npreparation of a draft protocol against the smuggling of\r\nmigrants by land, air and sea as part of the process of\r\npreparing a convention against transnational organized\r\ncrime, under the auspices of the United Nations\r\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.\r\nThe European Union believes that such activities must\r\nbe internationally criminalized, and that cooperation\r\namong States should be strengthened in this area.\r\nThe European Union reiterates the importance of\r\nprotecting marine natural resources. Last year, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in its resolution 54/32, entitled\r\n“Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions\r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation\r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks”, noted the fragility of stocks of\r\nmarine natural resources. This remains a pressing issue\r\nthis year, and we call upon Member States to sign and\r\nratify that Agreement. The European Community and\r\nits member States signed it in 1996, and instruments of\r\nratification will be deposited upon completion of each\r\nState’s internal constitutional procedures. The\r\nEuropean Union recalls the equitable balance of\r\ninterests reflected in the drafting of the Agreement, and\r\nthe Union vigorously urges all signatory States fully to\r\nrespect every provision of the Agreement without\r\napplying interpretations that go beyond the general\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea.\r\nHere, it is worth recalling the need to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation in the conservation and\r\nsustainable management of fish resources. The\r\nEuropean Union therefore strongly supports the\r\nestablishment and strengthening of regional fisheries\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\norganizations. We deem it necessary, however, to recall\r\nthat the development of these organizations should take\r\nplace with due regard for the principles of the law of\r\nthe sea and in the context of respect for a balance\r\nbetween the rights and obligations of States on the high\r\nseas. Furthermore, these organizations should be open\r\nto all States with genuine fishing interests in the\r\nfisheries that they administer.\r\nThe European Union believes also that the Code\r\nof Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, drafted under the\r\nauspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of\r\nthe United Nations (FAO), is a particularly useful tool,\r\nand it continues to recommend its use by all national\r\nand regional bodies responsible for administering\r\nfisheries. We believe that the adoption of this Code will\r\nlead to the fair and sustainable management of\r\nresources. We thank the FAO for its efforts to promote\r\nthis Code of Conduct. For our part, we will ensure that\r\nthe Code governs the relations of the European\r\nCommunity and developing States with respect to\r\nfishing activities.\r\nWithin the framework of this Code, the main\r\npriority is to continue work on an international plan of\r\naction to prevent and eliminate illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing. The European Union hopes that\r\nthe meeting in 2001 of the FAO Committee on\r\nFisheries will lead to the adoption of a dynamic plan\r\nthat includes a comprehensive set of tools to deal with\r\nillegal fishing, including all those already in place or\r\nbeing developed in regional fisheries management\r\norganizations. These include, for instance, measures\r\nrelating to port State control, trade-related measures,\r\nand — without prejudice to the essential role of the\r\nflag State — measures against nationals engaged in\r\nillegal fishing activities.\r\nThe European Union considers the issue of\r\nmarine pollution from land-based sources to be a\r\nmatter of the great importance. We therefore welcome\r\nthe quality and richness of the discussions held in the\r\nframework of the first meeting of the Informal\r\nConsultative Process on ocean affairs. We fully share\r\nthe view that it is absolutely necessary, in the pursuit of\r\nthe goal of sustainable development, to make use of a\r\nmore integrated approach in fighting pollution and the\r\ndegradation of the marine environment and in\r\ncombating its harmful effects on health, on the\r\neconomy and on society.\r\nTo this end, we also believe it necessary to\r\npromote the effective implementation of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action for the Protection of the Marine\r\nEnvironment from Land-based Activities and to ensure\r\nthat its objectives are adequately and effectively\r\ntranslated into local, national and regional plans of\r\naction and fully taken into account in the work of\r\ninternational financial institutions and of bilateral and\r\nmultilateral donors.\r\nWe believe also that the combat against marine\r\npollution from land-based sources can be truly\r\neffective only if it is waged at the level of the entire\r\ncatchment basin, with priority accorded to prevention\r\nmeasures at the source. We therefore favour the\r\ndevelopment of an integrated approach to coastal zone\r\nmanagement and to the catchment basin as a whole that\r\ntakes into account the ecosystems concerned. In this\r\nregard, we deem it essential to promote capacity-\r\nbuilding at all levels, particularly the local level,\r\nespecially in developing countries.\r\nWe are concerned, however, at the risks posed by\r\nmaritime transport activities that do not respect the\r\nsafety rules prescribed by international regulations.\r\nWith regard to pollution from vessels, several matters\r\nremain to be resolved, despite their social, economic\r\nand environmental importance. These relate in\r\nparticular to the implementation of the relevant\r\ninternational legal instruments, the transport of goods,\r\nsafety rules, and the rules governing routing and flag\r\nchanges.\r\nThe European Union stresses also the importance\r\nof the protection of the underwater cultural heritage.\r\nWe hope that all interested parties will continue to play\r\nan active role in the elaboration of a United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) draft convention.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the efforts of the\r\nSecretariat to improve the report and the timeliness of\r\nits publication. It encourages the Secretariat to find\r\nways and means of making further improvements, in\r\naccordance with paragraph 42 of the draft resolution on\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”, which contains\r\nsuggestions on improving coordination on ocean\r\nissues. This year’s report and subsequent efforts will\r\nconfirm our confidence in the ability of the Secretariat\r\nto deal with this issue competently and efficiently.\r\nFinally, we would like once again to encourage\r\nthe continuation of the discussions begun within the\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nconsultative process on oceans and law of the sea, a\r\nprocess which, we believe, has made an important and\r\neffective contribution to preparations for, and to the\r\nrichness of, today’s debate.\r\nMr. Longva (Norway): The entry into force in\r\n1994 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea was an event of historic significance.\r\nThe Convention remains the fundamental legal\r\nframework within which all activities related to the\r\noceans must be considered.\r\nThe implementation of the Convention involves\r\nimportant parts of the United Nations system. Under\r\nthe Convention and related resolutions of the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference of the Law of the Sea,\r\nimportant responsibilities are entrusted to the\r\nSecretary-General. In its pertinent resolutions, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has requested the Secretary-General\r\nto carry out these responsibilities. Different provisions\r\nof the Convention assign important tasks with respect\r\nto its implementation to competent international\r\norganizations, such as the International Maritime\r\nOrganization (IMO) and the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO). The\r\ninstitutions established under the Convention itself,\r\nincluding the Meeting of States Parties, have their own\r\nspecific tasks with respect to its implementation. The\r\nGeneral Assembly is the only global body with the\r\ncompetence to undertake overall reviews and\r\nevaluations of the implementation of the Convention\r\nand other developments relating to ocean affairs and\r\nthe law of the sea.\r\nIn its resolution 49/28, the General Assembly\r\ndecided to undertake an annual review and evaluation\r\non the basis of a comprehensive report prepared by the\r\nSecretary-General. Norway attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to this mechanism, which is also an\r\nimplementation of article 319, paragraph 2,\r\nsubparagraph (a) of the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea.\r\nSince the entry into force of UNCLOS, the\r\nestablishment of the institutions created under the\r\nConvention has been the main challenge with respect to\r\nits implementation. The International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf are now established and working.\r\nThis is no minor achievement, given the short period of\r\ntime that has elapsed since 1994.\r\nIn the view of the Norwegian Government, the\r\nnext important task with respect to the implementation\r\nof UNCLOS is a follow-up to part XII, on protection\r\nand preservation of the marine environment, part XIII,\r\non marine scientific research and part XIV, on\r\ndevelopment and transfer of marine technology. These\r\nare tasks which will require international cooperation\r\nat both the global and regional levels. Furthermore,\r\nthey will necessitate increased national attention and\r\nlegislative action if we are to make better use of the\r\nprovisions of these parts of UNCLOS.\r\nAn important task with respect to the\r\nimplementation of UNCLOS is the follow-up to part\r\nXIV, on development and transfer of marine\r\ntechnology. Appropriate international funding for\r\nocean research and development is an important aspect\r\nof this task. Many States, especially developing States,\r\nhave a need for advice and assistance in implementing\r\nthe Convention and developing and strengthening their\r\ncapabilities in order to enable them to benefit fully\r\nfrom the legal regime for the seas and oceans\r\nestablished by the Convention.\r\nToday, an urgent challenge with respect to\r\ndevelopment and transfer of marine technology is that\r\nof providing the least developed States, including small\r\nisland developing States, with adequate funding and\r\ntechnical assistance for the submission of technical and\r\nscientific data to the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, in accordance with article 76 of\r\nUNCLOS.\r\nWe are conscious of the need for States that have\r\na continental shelf which extends beyond 200 miles to\r\ndevote appropriate national resources to carrying out\r\nthe preparatory work needed for the submission of\r\ninformation to the Commission. For relevant least\r\ndeveloped countries in particular, including small\r\nisland developing States, this may represent a\r\nconsiderable expenditure in the short term, while\r\nhaving a bearing on the future mapping of the natural\r\nresources of the continental shelf. Norway\r\nacknowledges the importance of adequate support in\r\nthis context.\r\nWe consider it both timely and appropriate,\r\ntherefore, to endeavour to take forward, at this General\r\nAssembly session, in cooperation with other States, the\r\nrecommendation from the Tenth Meeting of States\r\nParties to the Convention, to establish a voluntary trust\r\nfund intended to assist these States, both in respect of\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nthe scientific and technical requirements to be met in\r\nmaking a submission and of the ability to comply with\r\nthe time limit set forth in the Convention. We see the\r\nestablishment of such a fund as a contribution to\r\npromoting and implementing important principles of\r\npart XIV of the Convention, on development and\r\ntransfer of marine technology.\r\nI have the pleasure to announce that as soon as\r\nthe trust fund has been established, Norway will make\r\na contribution of $1 million, subject to Parliamentary\r\napproval of the Government’s budgetary proposal in\r\nthe immediate future. We urge other States, as well as\r\ninternational organizations and other bodies, to match\r\nthis contribution.\r\nThere have been important and substantial\r\ndevelopments related to the work of the three\r\ninstitutions created by the Convention. We are pleased\r\nthat the International Seabed Authority was able to\r\ncomplete its sixth session with the adoption, on 13 July\r\n2000, of Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration\r\nfor Polymetallic Nodules in the Area for mining\r\nactivities in the Area — the so-called mining code. The\r\nAuthority is now able to proceed to issue contracts for\r\nexploration with the seven registered pioneer investors\r\nwhose plans of work were approved by the Council of\r\nthe Authority in 1997.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nis demonstrating an effective role pursuant to the\r\nConvention. The Tribunal is one of several means of\r\ndispute settlement procedures that States parties may\r\nchoose under article 287 of the Convention. The\r\nburden of costs should not influence the decision on\r\nthe choice of settlement procedure. We support the\r\nestablishment of a trust fund to provide financial\r\nassistance to States parties for expenses incurred in\r\nconnection with cases submitted, or to be submitted, to\r\nthe Tribunal. Norway will also consider contributing to\r\nthis fund.\r\nAs regards the Commission for the delimitation\r\nof the outer limits of the continental shelf, we were\r\nquite satisfied with the useful, high-quality\r\npresentations given by the Commission at its open\r\nmeeting in New York on 1 May this year. The meeting\r\nwas intended to familiarize representatives of coastal\r\nStates with the issue of the delineation of the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf and the functions of the\r\nCommission in that respect. The Commission is\r\ncurrently prepared both to accept submissions from\r\ncoastal States and to provide any scientific and\r\ntechnical advice that States preparing submissions may\r\nwish to obtain. Information on the limits should be\r\nsubmitted to the Commission within 10 years of the\r\nentry into force of the Convention for that State.\r\nThe International Maritime Organization (IMO)\r\nis one of the main competent organizations under the\r\nConvention and the appropriate forum to address and\r\nadopt safety and pollution prevention standards\r\naffecting international shipping. Norway welcomes the\r\nIMO’s substantive work on regulating the prevention of\r\npollution of the marine environment by ships, and\r\nappreciated the Organization’s follow-up on the\r\nproposals instigated in the wake of the sinking of the\r\noil tanker Erika in December 1999. As in the past, we\r\nare certain of the Organization’s ability to act in a\r\ndecisive and expeditious manner on suggestions put\r\nbefore it.\r\nNorway was among the early ratifiers of the\r\nUnited Nations Agreement on Fish Stocks. We are\r\nconcerned that today, more than four years after its\r\nadoption, it has still not entered into force. We urge\r\nother States to ratify and implement the Agreement as\r\nsoon as possible. At the same time, however, it ought\r\nto be stressed again that the status of fisheries on the\r\nhigh seas in certain areas is so alarming that one cannot\r\nawait the entry into force of the United Nations\r\nAgreement in order to take appropriate action.\r\nUnregulated fisheries need to be brought under control,\r\nand this is a precondition for the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of fisheries. In this connection, we\r\nrecognize the strides made by existing regional\r\nfisheries organizations and arrangements, such as the\r\nNorth-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the\r\nNorth-West Atlantic Fisheries Organization, including\r\nthe adoption of mandatory vessel-monitoring systems.\r\nWe are pleased to welcome the conclusion of\r\nsuccessful negotiations on the establishment of new\r\nregional fisheries management organizations into\r\nheretofore unmanaged fisheries in the South-East\r\nAtlantic and the Western and Central Pacific.\r\nIn an attempt to further discourage unregulated\r\nfisheries on the high seas, Norway adopted regulations\r\nstating that an application for a licence to fish in the\r\nNorwegian economic zone may be denied or withdrawn\r\nif the vessel in question, or its owner, has participated\r\nin unregulated fisheries on the high seas involving fish\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nstocks that are subject to regulation in waters under\r\nNorwegian fisheries jurisdiction.\r\nThe provisions imply, inter alia, that a given\r\nvessel may also be denied a fishing licence in\r\nNorwegian waters even if it is operated by persons\r\nother than those who participate in the unregulated\r\nfishing concerned. Last year, these regulations were\r\namended to include fishing operations that contravene\r\nregulatory measures laid down by regional fisheries\r\norganizations and with regard to fish stocks other than\r\nthose subject to regulation in waters under Norwegian\r\njurisdiction. Since this has reduced the second-hand\r\nmarket value of any vessel that has participated in\r\nunregulated fishing, it has proved to be an effective\r\ntool in combating unregulated fisheries.\r\nIllegal, unregulated and unreported fishing also\r\noccurs in zones under the national jurisdiction of\r\ncoastal States, particularly developing coastal States, in\r\nviolation of their rights and jurisdiction to conserve\r\nand manage the living marine resources in those areas.\r\nNorway recognizes the need for capacity-building to\r\nensure that, developing States especially, have the\r\nability to benefit from the sustainable development of\r\ntheir marine resources and to provide assistance to\r\ndeveloping States in upgrading their capabilities in\r\nmonitoring, control and enforcement of fishing\r\nregulations.\r\nThe technical consultations that took place at the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO) Headquarters in Rome earlier this\r\nmonth aimed at agreeing on an international plan of\r\naction to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported\r\nfishing are both timely and necessary. We support the\r\nefforts to bring these negotiations to a successful\r\nconclusion in time for the adoption of a plan of action\r\nby the FAO Committee on Fisheries in February 2001.\r\nThe large over-investment and consequently,\r\nover-capacity, in the world’s fishing fleets is another\r\nurgent issue that needs to be addressed. All States\r\nshould take action in this regard by actively taking\r\nmeasures to bring their fishing fleets in balance with\r\nthe carrying capacity of available resources. Subsidies\r\nleading to over-capacity should be eliminated.\r\nDecommissioning schemes should be introduced when\r\nappropriate. Norway will continue to participate in a\r\nconstructive manner in work on this issue, within both\r\nthe FAO and the World Trade Organization (WTO).\r\nNorway is following closely the work being\r\ncarried out within a meeting of governmental experts\r\nconvened by the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to consider a\r\ndraft convention for the protection of underwater\r\ncultural heritage. While being conscious of the need to\r\nensure proper protection of that cultural heritage, it is\r\nin our view imperative that new regulations in this field\r\nmust be in full conformity with the relevant provisions\r\nof the United Nations Conference on the Law of the\r\nSea, including those concerning the rights and\r\njurisdiction of the coastal State and the rights and\r\nfreedom of other States in the exclusive economic zone\r\nand on the continental shelf, and those concerning the\r\nfreedom of the high seas. Consensus on this point is\r\nessential if a draft text is to be considered for adoption.\r\nNorway is of the opinion that a possible new\r\nlegal instrument should be linked to the United Nations\r\nConference on the Law of the Sea in the same way as\r\nthe United Nations Agreement on fish stocks is. We are\r\nconvinced that the United Nations General Assembly,\r\nthrough consideration of its agenda item on “Oceans\r\nand the law of the sea”, can and should provide the\r\nnecessary guidance and coordination to the ongoing\r\nwork within UNESCO on the protection of the\r\nunderwater cultural heritage. In our view, the UNESCO\r\nGeneral Conference should transmit to the United\r\nNations General Assembly a possible draft text for a\r\nnew international instrument for appropriate\r\nconsideration and possible adoption.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea, which constitutes the basis for our\r\ndebate today, documents a dynamic and expanding\r\noceans agenda. It is important that the General\r\nAssembly be up to this challenge. The question of what\r\nform this debate should take in the future has been\r\nraised. It is a widely held view that more time and\r\nattention should be devoted by the Assembly to the\r\nSecretary-General’s annual report on oceans and law of\r\nthe sea. The open-ended informal consultative process\r\nestablished for a three-year period in resolution 54/33\r\nmust be seen against this background. Substantive\r\nelements that emerged from the first meeting of this\r\nprocess have contributed to a broader understanding of\r\nissues covered by the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThe review of the effectiveness and utility of the\r\ninformal consultative process at the fifty-seventh\r\nsession in 2002 will give us a good opportunity to take\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nstock of the progress made and to decide the direction\r\nto be taken in the future.\r\nMr. King (Canada): I am pleased to be here today\r\nto share with you Canada’s perspective on the\r\nimportance of sound oceans management. Indeed,\r\ntoday’s debate provides an excellent opportunity to\r\nreflect on our ocean responsibilities — how we care for\r\nand manage the seas, now and in the years to come. We\r\nhave an opportunity as ocean nations, in particular, to\r\nrenew our global commitment to the sustainable use\r\nand responsible development of oceans and their\r\nresources.\r\nCanada certainly considers itself to be an ocean\r\nnation. We have long had a significant stake in\r\nensuring the health and well-being of our oceans. We\r\nare one of the few States in the world that borders on\r\nthree oceans. Our history and trade are inextricably\r\nlinked to the sea. Today, our oceans remain the base\r\nupon which our coastal communities grow and flourish.\r\nWe continue to prosper from them. And they still play\r\na key role in shaping our identity as Canadians.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nBut today, Canada, like other nations around the\r\nworld, is expanding its conception of what our oceans\r\ncan provide. Traditional activities like fishing and\r\nshipping are now being joined by new and rapidly\r\nexpanding activities like tourism, aquaculture, and oil\r\nand gas exportation. While this growth in activity is\r\npositive, managing this growth well means striking a\r\nsometimes delicate balance. We want to give new\r\nocean activities room to grow and flourish, but we also\r\nwant to protect our precious coastal and marine\r\nenvironments for future generations.\r\nOther ocean nations also share these concerns. In\r\nrecent decades, throughout the world, our attitudes\r\ntowards our oceans have changed. They are no longer\r\nseen as limitless. Their increasing vulnerability, over\r\nboth the short and long terms, is a harsh reality that we\r\nare facing at a global level.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThis vulnerability affects the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. That is why we must find\r\nsolutions as a whole. It is as a community that we must\r\ntake the steps necessary to conserve and protect this\r\nexceptional heritage for present and future generations.\r\nWe must do this in two interrelated steps — at the\r\nnational level and at the international level. It was in\r\nthis spirit that Canada became the first nation in the\r\nworld to adopt an Oceans Act in 1997. The Act is our\r\nnational blueprint for managing the relationship\r\nbetween our land and our three oceans in a fully\r\nintegrated and sustainable way.\r\nThe Act clearly establishes, for the first time, the\r\nprinciples we want to foster in our oceans-management\r\nactivities, principles like sustainable development and\r\nthe precautionary and ecosystem approaches. It also\r\ngives us the specific legal and regulatory mechanisms\r\nwe need to make our commitment to healthy oceans a\r\nreality. But it does something more.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nTo truly manage our oceans well, we must share\r\nthe responsibility of stewardship and find ways to\r\nactively engage citizens in the process. In Canada,\r\nthere are a host of interest groups that want to be part\r\nof the process. These include governments, industry,\r\nmunicipalities and indigenous communities. In all our\r\nactivities we must find the best ways to balance these\r\ngroups’ different needs and perspectives, be they\r\nsocial, cultural, environmental or economic.\r\nThis is why the Oceans Act provides an effective\r\nmechanism to engage these groups in order to come up\r\nwith the best possible mix of conservation, sustainable\r\nuse and lasting economic development for our oceans\r\nin the years ahead. In short, the Act’s commitment to\r\nintegrated management is helping us to increase\r\nCanadians’ involvement in the management of our\r\noceans.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe are already seeing tangible results through our\r\nIntegrated Management Programme and our work to\r\nidentify marine protected areas. But our commitment to\r\nintegrated management is not confined within our\r\nborders. Indeed, the challenges related to Canada’s\r\ndomestic oceans strongly parallel those we face at the\r\ninternational level. That is why we need to find overall\r\n“oceans solutions”.\r\nThe challenge for us as a community is to find\r\nways for diverse interested parties to participate\r\nmeaningfully in planning and decision-making, while\r\navoiding duplication and waste. This need for\r\nimproved cooperation and integration on the global\r\nfront resulted in the creation of the United Nations\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea (UNICPOLOS). The instruction\r\nmandate given to UNICPOLOS by the General\r\nAssembly made it very clear that coordination and\r\ncooperation should be made a top priority.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nImproved coordination is exactly what we\r\nneed — locally, regionally and globally. In fact, since\r\nRio in 1992, several international bodies have issued\r\ncalls to work towards this goal. UNICPOLOS is\r\ntranslating this commitment into reality.\r\nCanada is very pleased with the results of the first\r\nUNICPOLOS meeting, which have been carried\r\nforward in the draft resolution currently before the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFrom that meeting, we have gained the\r\nimpression that the informality of UNICPOLOS is\r\nclearly its strength. We should strive to keep this\r\nprocess informal and encourage more direct exchanges\r\nbetween delegations and experts. In that way,\r\nUNICPOLOS can become an effective sounding board\r\nfor new ideas about international oceans governance.\r\nTake the Global Programme of Action, which was\r\ndiscussed at UNICPOLOS. The Programme encourages\r\nStates to develop regional and national programmes to\r\nprevent, reduce and control land-based activities that\r\ndegrade the marine environment. In Canada, we attach\r\ngreat importance to the Global Programme. On 8 June\r\n2000 — Oceans Day in Canada — Canada became the\r\nfirst country in the world to develop its own National\r\nProgramme of Action as part of the Global Programme.\r\nCanada’s National Programme is giving us a strong and\r\neffective mechanism to bring different levels of\r\ngovernment together to find cooperative, shared\r\nsolutions. As a result, numerous initiatives are now in\r\nplace, with the involvement of all levels of\r\ngovernment.\r\nIn this context, I am pleased to announce that\r\nCanada will host the first five-year intergovernmental\r\nreview of the Global Programme of Action in the fall\r\nof 2001. At this review we will all have the opportunity\r\nto measure our progress so far. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to formally invite all Governments to\r\nparticipate in this review.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nLet me now turn to an area of particular concern\r\nto Canada: fishing. In the fishing industry, the need to\r\nuse the tools we have at our disposal is apparent. The\r\nproblems besetting the world’s fisheries are well\r\nknown: too much capacity, too much killing power, too\r\nmuch rule-breaking and too little cooperation.\r\nFortunately, the solutions to these problems are also\r\nknown: reduction of capacity, management of stocks\r\nthroughout their range and conservation measures\r\nbased on scientific data and effective implementation.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThese solutions have been embodied in three\r\ninternational instruments: the 1995 United Nations\r\nAgreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks, the Compliance Agreement of the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\r\nand the FAO Code of Conduct. They are also being\r\naddressed in an initiative currently under way in the\r\nFAO to create an international plan of action on illegal,\r\nunregulated and unreported fishing. UNICPOLOS also\r\nhad a role to play here, dedicating a panel to this\r\nwidespread problem.\r\nWe are heartened that the 1995 United Nations\r\nAgreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks is rapidly approaching entry into force. The\r\n1995 Agreement is the most important tool we have to\r\ndeal with the problems facing the world’s fisheries.\r\nThe Agreement’s strength lies in several areas: in its\r\nguiding principles, such as the precautionary approach,\r\nfor the establishment of conservation and management\r\nmeasures; in the obligations it places upon all States\r\nparties not to undermine conservation and management\r\nmeasures taken by a regional fisheries management\r\norganization, whether or not they are a member of that\r\norganization; in its non-flag State enforcement regime;\r\nand in its binding dispute-settlement procedures.\r\nHowever, agreements are worth little if they are\r\nnot ratified and implemented. For its part, Canada\r\nratified the 1995 Agreement in 1999 and has brought\r\nits domestic and foreign fisheries policies in line with\r\nthe Agreement. We are also working hard to ensure that\r\nthe Agreement is implemented in the regional fisheries-\r\nmanagement organizations to which Canada belongs.\r\nCanada would urge all countries to become party\r\nto the 1995 Agreement and then work to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of their obligations under that\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nAgreement. In particular, States must ensure that the\r\nAgreement is fully applied within regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada is under no illusions with regard to\r\nsolving the problems of the world’s fisheries. We\r\nunderstand the extent of these problems. However, we\r\ncan and must put an end to the exhaustion of fish\r\nstocks. If we fail to do so, it is because we have failed\r\ncollectively, at the international level, to use the tools\r\navailable to us.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAnd so, just as we look to the future for hope, we\r\ncan look to the past for inspiration. The protection of\r\nthe oceans, and the rational use and development of\r\ntheir living resources was a major theme at the 1992\r\nworld environmental summit at Rio. Canada believes\r\nthis theme can and should be an important inspiration\r\nin the upcoming Rio +10 Conference in 2002.\r\nI thank you, Sir, for allowing me to share the\r\nCanadian perspective on oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nAs a community of nations, we share a magnificent\r\nresource, but one that requires our vigilance and our\r\nattention. We owe it to those who will follow us to\r\nensure that we leave them a healthy, productive and\r\nsustainable oceans environment.\r\nMr. Sorreta (Philippines): Our growing\r\npopulations and our ever-shrinking world have meant\r\nadded burdens on our seas and oceans. Our seas remain\r\nan important source of sustenance and resources. Trade\r\nand commerce, the lifeblood of our globalized world,\r\nflow through our oceans at an increasing rate. Changes\r\nin the weather and environmental conditions in the seas\r\nbear indelibly on the rest of the globe.\r\nThe stakes continue to remain high as we carry on\r\nwith our common effort to establish policies and norms\r\nfor the peaceful, orderly, fair and sustainable use of our\r\nseas and oceans. These efforts were given a boost when\r\nwe established and held this year the first meeting of\r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea to\r\nreview developments in ocean affairs. Participation in\r\nthat meeting was almost universal and experts from\r\nvirtually all disciplines relating to the seas and oceans\r\nwere present. The Philippines looks forward to the next\r\nmeeting in this Consultative Process. We are very\r\npleased that agreement could be reached in draft\r\nresolution A/55/L.10 on the subjects for the next\r\nmeeting of the Process. We welcome in particular the\r\ninclusion of the issue of the development and transfer\r\nof marine technology and capacity-building. I am\r\nconfident that we will be able to focus our discussions\r\nand arrive at meaningful results.\r\nMeaningful results are what we need when it\r\ncomes to the problems relating to unauthorized fishing\r\nin zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas,\r\nand to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The\r\nliving marine resources of my country are under siege.\r\nOur marginal and traditional fisher-folk have to stay\r\nlonger and go farther out to sea, and even then are not\r\nassured of any catch. This affects almost all of the\r\nfishing communities in my country and threatens the\r\nlivelihood, the social and family well-being, as well as\r\nthe very lives of a very large number of my\r\ncountrymen.\r\nWe take our duty to protect our seas very\r\nseriously and exert every effort to prevent illegal\r\nfishing. We also actively participate in regional efforts\r\nto stem the flow of illegal fishing. However, we believe\r\nthat the flag States have a responsibility to bear when\r\ntheir ships ignore established laws and disregard the\r\nwelfare of the environment.\r\nIn this regard, the Philippines strongly supports\r\nthe call in draft resolution A/55/L.11 on States to\r\nensure that fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag do\r\nnot fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other\r\nStates, unless duly authorized by the States concerned,\r\nand that they do not fish on the high seas in\r\ncontravention of the applicable conservation and\r\nmanagement measures.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation to\r\nthose flag States that have adopted measures to\r\nimplement this call. We appreciate in particular those\r\nStates which included the measures they have taken in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General in document\r\nA/55/386.\r\nRules and standards are indeed important and\r\nevery State has actively sought to establish these in our\r\nseas and oceans. Of particular significance for my\r\ncountry are the determined and dedicated efforts of the\r\nsmall island developing States. They are the custodians\r\nof large areas of the world’s oceans and have a high\r\nshare of global biodiversity.\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nBecause of the sensitivity of their environment\r\nand the delicate nature of their biodiversity, the small\r\nisland developing States have exerted every effort and\r\nexercised great care in trying to establish higher\r\nstandards in a variety of forums, even in one such as\r\nthe 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\r\nwhere they proved to be effective advocates in\r\nprotecting our oceans from nuclear waste. The norms\r\nand practices that they create in protecting the\r\nbiodiversity of the small island developing States\r\nshould serve as a benchmark for everyone’s own efforts\r\nto do the same.\r\nWe are heartened by the inclusion in the agenda\r\nof the next meeting of the Consultative Process of the\r\nitem on coordination and cooperation in combating\r\npiracy and armed robbery at sea. We also welcome the\r\ncontinued emphasis given in draft resolution A/55/L.10\r\non the problem of piracy. This is a problem that has\r\nreached serious and alarming levels in recent years.\r\nThe issue of piracy and armed robbery against\r\nships is high on the agenda of the Philippine\r\nGovernment and is being handled at the cabinet level,\r\nwhere a process is being initiated whereby we will\r\nadopt a national plan of action to address piracy and\r\narmed robbery against ships. This national action plan\r\nwill involve policies, strategies and the establishment\r\nof the necessary infrastructure and operational\r\narrangements for preventing and suppressing piracy\r\nattacks and armed robbery against ships within and\r\nbeyond Philippine waters.\r\nWhile the seas are a source of life and sustenance,\r\nthey can, ironically, also be a source of potential\r\nconflict. At the last session of the General Assembly,\r\nthe Secretary-General concluded in his report on\r\noceans and the law of the sea that it is particularly\r\nimportant that States agree on secure maritime\r\nboundaries, since such agreements contribute to the\r\npromotion of peace and stability at the regional level.\r\nFor the Philippines, secure maritime boundaries\r\nmean exactly that: boundaries that are established by\r\nlaw and agreement and not boundaries that are secured\r\nor imposed by force alone. Securing maritime\r\nboundaries is a difficult process. This process is made\r\neven more difficult when disputes over boundaries are\r\ncoupled with territorial claims. As a country\r\nsurrounded by seas on all sides, the Philippines\r\ncontinues to exert every effort to negotiate with its\r\nneighbours on our boundaries. Some negotiations are\r\nmore difficult and infinitely more complex than others.\r\nThe conflicting claims to the South China Sea\r\npresent one of the more demanding challenges to our\r\nefforts to secure our maritime boundaries. We base all\r\nour actions on the need to settle these disputes\r\npeacefully, in accordance with international law,\r\nincluding the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea (UNCLOS), and to continue to exercise self-\r\nrestraint in the conduct of activities in the South China\r\nSea.\r\nIn this regard, the Philippines has proposed the\r\nadoption of a regional code of conduct, which we hope\r\nwill lay the foundation for long-term stability in the\r\nocean and sea areas and foster greater trust and\r\nunderstanding among claimant countries. The leaders\r\nof the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), at their Sixth ASEAN Summit, agreed to\r\npromote efforts to establish this code of conduct among\r\nthe parties directly concerned. Earlier this month, the\r\nASEAN-China Working Group on the Regional Code\r\nof Conduct on the South China Sea met once again and\r\nsucceeded in narrowing differences on fundamental\r\nissues.\r\nThe Philippines expresses its appreciation to all\r\nStates that have continued to take an interest in the\r\npeaceful, just and meaningful resolution of the\r\nconflicting claims in the South China Sea, particularly\r\nthose that have helped to advance the dialogue on this\r\nissue by organizing and sponsoring meetings and\r\ndiscussions in informal and academic forums.\r\nFor the Philippines, the seas are not just a source\r\nof profit or business, but an important component of\r\nmy country’s food security and natural environment. In\r\nthis context, we view draft resolution A/55/L.11 as a\r\ntotality, with each component an indispensable part of\r\nthe whole. The Philippines is a sponsor of that draft\r\nresolution, will support it in its entirety and hopes that\r\nothers will do likewise. We have also been a traditional\r\nsponsor of draft resolution A/55/L.10 and hope that it\r\nwill be adopted with the widest support possible.\r\nAs I said earlier, the stakes remain high, but we\r\nare confident that we are moving in the right direction.\r\nOur collective efforts are greatly aided by those who\r\nmake sure that attention continues to be focused on our\r\nseas and oceans. We are thankful for the reports of the\r\nSecretary-General under the agenda item “Oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea”, as these help us understand where\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nwe are and assist us in deciding where we want to go in\r\nthe future. We also deeply appreciate the efforts of\r\nspecific countries — particularly the delegations of\r\nArgentina, Australia, Guyana, New Zealand and the\r\nUnited States — in coordinating the crafting of the two\r\ndraft resolutions before us, a task that was full of\r\nchallenges. We also appreciate the active role played\r\nby the Group of 77 in the work on these draft\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe Chairman of the Meeting of UNCLOS States\r\nParties and the co-Chairmen of the Consultative\r\nProcess must also be commended for their hard work\r\non behalf of our seas and oceans, and of course we\r\nmust express our appreciation and recognize the hard\r\nwork of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of\r\nthe Sea, whose dedication, expertise and\r\nprofessionalism are proving to be the glue that binds all\r\nour efforts. Even though we continue to expand the\r\ndialogue and venue on the law of the sea and on the\r\noceans, we must remain focused on the fundamental\r\nneed to protect our seas and oceans. This should\r\nremain our basic premise and should guide us in our\r\nfuture work.\r\nMr. Ingólfsson (Iceland): At the outset, I would\r\nlike to commend the Secretariat, in particular the very\r\nable staff of the Division of Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea, for the comprehensive report on the oceans\r\nand the law of the sea. In our view, the report is a good\r\nbasis for the annual debate in the General Assembly. I\r\nwould also like to acknowledge the professional\r\nmanner in which the coordinators conducted the\r\ninformal consultations on the resolutions.\r\nThe oceans are receiving growing attention in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We welcome this development. The\r\noceans are of particular importance to Iceland, as our\r\neconomy is based on the sustainable harvesting of\r\nliving marine resources. The health and responsible\r\nstewardship of the oceans are therefore of critical\r\nimportance to Iceland.\r\nAt the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly, we went through a substantial discussion on\r\nwhether there was a need to improve coordination and\r\ncooperation in the area of ocean affairs, and if so, how\r\nit could be carried out. It was concluded that more time\r\nwas needed to discuss the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the oceans and the law of the sea. It was\r\nalso agreed that there was a need for more active\r\nparticipation on the part of experts from capitals in\r\nsuch discussions, including legal advisors, experts in\r\nocean affairs and environment experts. For this\r\npurpose, the General Assembly adopted resolution\r\n54/33, establishing for three years an informal\r\nconsultative process to discuss the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport.\r\nIceland took an active part in the preparation of\r\nresolution 54/33 and in the subsequent first meeting of\r\nthis informal process last May. Generally speaking, we\r\nwere satisfied with the first meeting of the informal\r\nprocess and would like to use this opportunity to thank\r\nthe two Co-Chairmen, Ambassador Neroni Slade and\r\nMr. Alan Simcock, for their valuable contribution\r\nincluding the report of the meeting.\r\nMy Government is, however, very concerned over\r\nthe direction in which the subsequent debate here in the\r\nGeneral Assembly seems to be moving. To be more\r\nspecific, in the informal consultations this fall, several\r\ncountries attempted to develop a general resolution on\r\nthe fishery sector. My Government shares the concern\r\nof many countries over the state of the oceans and of\r\nfish stocks in some regions. My Government also\r\nunderstands the position of those countries pressing for\r\na more active role of the General Assembly in the area\r\nof fisheries. Most of those countries are industrial\r\ncountries, some of which have depleted or even lost\r\nfish stocks due to over-fishing. Many of them have\r\nover-capacity in their fisheries, leading them to send\r\ntheir fishing fleets to distant waters. Those countries\r\nshould, however, not seek to export their problems or\r\nmake generalizations on the state of fisheries on a\r\nglobal level. The fact that those countries have\r\nexperienced difficulties does not mean that fisheries\r\nare not being managed in a sustainable manner in other\r\nregions of the world.\r\nWe have to bear in mind that for many countries\r\nfisheries are the main or a fundamental economic\r\nsector. In the case of my country, Iceland, fisheries\r\nrepresent over 70 per cent of our total exports of goods.\r\nFisheries are also of fundamental importance for many\r\ndeveloping countries. In more than 20 countries,\r\nfisheries exports account for between 10 and 75 per\r\ncent of total merchandise exports. In another 38\r\ncountries, fisheries exports contribute between two and\r\nnine per cent of trade receipts.\r\nFisheries are particularly important for the\r\ndeveloping countries for their livelihood, food security\r\nand foreign exchange earnings. They provide the prime\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nsource of animal protein for one billion people in the\r\ndeveloping world. Of the 30 countries most dependent\r\non fish as a protein source, all but four are in the\r\ndeveloping world. In value terms the developing\r\ncountries accounted in 1996 for more than half of the\r\ntotal world exports of fish and fish products.\r\nWe cannot expect these countries or other\r\ncountries where fisheries are of fundamental economic\r\nimportance to be subjected to micro-management of\r\ntheir economies by the General Assembly. Let me ask a\r\nquestion: Should the General Assembly pass annually\r\nor biannually an open-ended resolution on agriculture\r\nor industry in general or the oil industry, to name just a\r\nfew examples? These sectors are of strategic\r\nimportance to many countries, just as fisheries are to\r\nIceland and many other coastal States.\r\nThis is not to say that the Government of Iceland\r\nis against all discussion in the General Assembly on\r\nissues that concern fisheries. But, we should focus such\r\ndiscussions on specific issues that have global\r\nimplications and not on issues that fall within the\r\npurview of sovereign rights of States. The General\r\nAssembly should address issues that are global in\r\nnature and can only be resolved through global\r\ncooperation. We should thus discuss marine pollution,\r\nwhich respects no boundaries and must therefore be\r\nmet with global action. We should also discuss needs to\r\nset a level playing field for the fishery sector that\r\nencourages sustainable fisheries globally, such as the\r\nneed to remove fishery subsidies. Further examples can\r\nbe identified.\r\nConservation and sustainable utilization of living\r\nmarine resources are, on the other hand, a local and\r\nregional matter. We cannot therefore accept opening\r\nthe door for global micro-management of fisheries,\r\nwhich are subject to the sovereign rights of States or\r\nunder the responsibility of regional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations. My Government stands\r\nfirmly against any attempts in the General Assembly to\r\npass resolutions of such nature.\r\nIn this context, we must bear in mind that the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea provides the legal\r\nplatform on which we must base all our deliberations.\r\nIt is imperative that the Convention be fully\r\nimplemented and that its integrity be preserved. We\r\nwelcome the ratification of the Convention by three\r\nmore States, which brings the total number of States\r\nparties to 135. We urge Member States of the United\r\nNations that still have not ratified the Convention to do\r\nso.\r\nIn our view the Agreement on straddling fish\r\nstocks and highly migratory fish stocks is also of\r\nparamount importance as it provides a framework for\r\nconservation and management of all stocks by regional\r\nfisheries management organizations. Only two\r\nadditional ratifications are now needed for the entry\r\ninto force of this agreement. We encourage States that\r\nstill have not ratified it to do so.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the three\r\ninstitutions established under the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea are functioning well. The International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea has already dealt with\r\nfive cases in an expeditious and effective manner. The\r\nInternational Seabed Authority has recently adopted\r\nthe so-called mining code, and we look forward to\r\nfurther substantive work on the part of the Authority.\r\nIceland has also followed with keen interest the\r\nwork of the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf. The Commission has adopted its\r\nrules of procedure and scientific and technical\r\nguidelines and is ready to receive submissions from\r\ncoastal States with information on the outer limits of\r\nthe continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. To\r\nfacilitate the work of coastal States in the preparation\r\nof submissions, the Commission held a successful open\r\nmeeting last spring and recently adopted in outline a\r\nfive-day training course on the delineation of the outer\r\nlimits of the continental shelf. Iceland is willing to\r\nassist in developing further such a training course.\r\nThe implementation of the Global Programme of\r\nAction for the Protection of the Marine Environment\r\nfrom Land-based Activity of marine pollution has\r\nfallen short of expectation. Next year an inter-\r\ngovernmental review will take place on the progress of\r\nthe implementation of the Global Programme of\r\nAction. It is important that this review lead to a\r\nrenewal of commitments to the implementation of this\r\nvery important programme. Pollution from land-based\r\nactivities is the most serious and imminent threat to\r\nocean habitats and biological diversity and represents\r\nbetween 70 and 80 per cent of all marine pollution.\r\nIt is imperative that States, intergovernmental\r\norganizations and United Nations agencies and\r\nprogrammes and other stakeholders take an active part\r\nin the 2001 intergovernmental review.\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nIn conclusion, we emphasize that we must act\r\nwith caution when seeking to improve our coordination\r\nand cooperation in the area of ocean affairs and the law\r\nof the sea. These issues must be addressed at the\r\nappropriate level and in a manner consistent with the\r\nrights and obligations set out in the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea and other relevant international\r\nagreements. That entails full respect for the sovereign\r\nrights of States over their living marine resources and\r\nfor the competence of existing international\r\norganizations.\r\nMr. Palanimanickam (India): My delegation has\r\njoined in sponsoring the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/54/L.10. We welcome the comprehensive\r\nand informative reports of the Secretary-General on\r\nmatters relating to the oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nHowever, we note that the report contained in\r\ndocument A/55/61 was prepared in March 2000.\r\nSeveral noteworthy and important developments\r\nrelating to the institutions established under the United\r\nNations Convention on Law of the Sea have taken\r\nplace. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea is the cornerstone of the international\r\nlegal regime relating to the oceans and seas. Given the\r\nimportance of the Convention, the need for its\r\nuniversal acceptance cannot be overemphasized. My\r\ndelegation notes with satisfaction that the number of\r\nStates party to the Convention continues to increase\r\nsteadily and to move closer to the ultimate goal of\r\nuniversal acceptance. However, we note that many\r\nStates whose provisional membership, under the terms\r\nof the 1994 Agreement relating to the implementation\r\nof Part XI of the Convention, has since expired, have\r\nnot so far taken the necessary steps to become parties\r\nto the Convention.\r\nThe unified character of the Convention must be\r\nmaintained in order to ensure its effective and uniform\r\nimplementation. It is essential for States parties, as a\r\nmatter of priority, to harmonize their national\r\nlegislations with the provisions of the Convention, in\r\norder to ensure the consistent application of those\r\nprovisions.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that all the\r\ninstitutions provided for under the Convention, namely,\r\nthe International Seabed Authority, the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, and the Commission\r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf, have been\r\nestablished and have completed work on the various\r\nadministrative and institutional matters essential for\r\ntheir proper and effective functioning. Thus, all the\r\ninstitutions are now fully functional, and in a position\r\nto carry out the substantive mandates assigned to them\r\nunder the Convention.\r\nWe welcome the adoption by the International\r\nSeabed Authority, at its resumed sixth session, of the\r\nRegulations on Prospecting and Exploration for\r\nPolymetallic Nodules in the Area, popularly referred to\r\nas the seabed mining code. The code constitutes the\r\nmost important substantive basis for carrying out the\r\nfunctions of the International Seabed Authority, and\r\nwith its completion, the Authority is now in a position\r\nto conclude formal contracts with the registered\r\npioneer investors. India, the first State to be registered\r\nas a pioneer investor in 1987, had its plans of work for\r\nexploration of the mine site in the Indian Ocean\r\napproved by the Authority in 1997, and having fulfilled\r\nall the obligations under the Convention, the\r\nAgreement relating to Part XI, and resolution II, is\r\neligible to obtain an exploration contract for its mine\r\nsite. The Authority also approved, at this session, the\r\nRules of Procedure of the Legal and Technical\r\nCommission, its Staff Regulations and elected 20\r\nmembers to serve on its Council for a four-year term\r\nbeginning in 200l. India was elected as a member of\r\nthe Council in Group B representing States which have\r\nmade the largest investment in seabed mining. We also\r\nwish to congratulate Ambassador Satya Nandan for his\r\nunanimous re-election as Secretary-General of the\r\nAuthority and to assure him of our full cooperation.\r\nThe Commission on Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf has adopted its Scientific and Technical\r\nGuidelines, which deal with the methodologies\r\nstipulated in Article 76 of the Convention for the\r\nestablishment of the outer limits of the continental\r\nshelf, and are intended to assist coastal States regarding\r\nthe technical nature and scope of the data and\r\ninformation that they need to submit to the\r\nCommission while submitting claims regarding the\r\nouter limits of their continental shelf. Thus, the\r\nCommission is now ready to accept submissions from\r\ncoastal States and also to provide scientific and\r\ntechnical advice to States in preparing their\r\nsubmissions.\r\nThe open meeting on delineation of the\r\ncontinental shelf organized by the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf at its seventh session,\r\nwas particularly useful. It provided an opportunity for\r\ndelegates to interact with members of the Commission,\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nto ascertain their views regarding the interpretation and\r\napplication of the Scientific and Technical Guidelines,\r\nand to obtain first hand information on the issues\r\nrelevant to the preparation by coastal States of\r\nsubmissions to establish the outer limits of their\r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. This will\r\nassist States in preparing their submissions to the\r\nCommission. The Commission has also prepared the\r\noutline of a five-day training course that will be of\r\npractical benefit to coastal States in training their\r\npersonnel through development of the requisite\r\nknowledge and skills.\r\nTurning to the International Tribunal for the Law\r\nof the Sea, we note that the Tribunal has become a\r\nfunctioning judicial institution in the short time since it\r\nwas inaugurated in October 1996. It has already heard\r\nfive cases involving many important issues, such as the\r\nfreedom of navigation and other internationally lawful\r\nuses of the seas, the enforcement of customs laws, re-\r\nfuelling vessels at sea and the right of hot pursuit, and\r\nwas able to deliver its orders and judgements in these\r\ncases very expeditiously. We note that the Tribunal’s\r\nnew premises were officially opened on 3 July 2000,\r\nand appreciate the facilities provided by the host\r\ncountry, Germany, to enable the Tribunal’s efficient\r\nfunctioning. With the conclusion of the agreement on\r\nthe use and occupancy of the new premises, which was\r\nsigned last week, the Tribunal will soon begin\r\nfunctioning from its new premises.\r\nAs noted in the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nthe over-exploitation of living marine resources and\r\nexcess fishing capacity continue to be a matter of grave\r\nconcern. In addition, the prevalence of illegal,\r\nunregulated and unreported fishing is a severe problem\r\naffecting world fisheries, particularly those of\r\ndeveloping countries, and is likely to have far-reaching\r\nadverse consequences for the long-term sustainable\r\nmanagement of their fisheries. The Agreement on the\r\nconservation and management of straddling fish stocks\r\nand highly migratory fish stocks was a significant\r\ndevelopment in the implementation of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and its\r\nearly entry into force and implementation could help\r\nreverse the trend of overfishing in many areas. The\r\nGovernment of India is presently examining the\r\nAgreement with a view to acceding to it.\r\nAs a member of the Indian Ocean Tuna\r\nCommission and the Western Indian Ocean Tuna\r\nOrganization, India is cooperating with the States of\r\nthe region in the conservation and management of\r\nfishery resources. The Code of Conduct for\r\nResponsible Fisheries, adopted by the United Nations\r\nFood And Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1995,\r\nand the FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with\r\nInternational Conservation and Management Measures\r\nby Fishing Vessels on the High Seas need to be acceded\r\nto and applied with immediate effect. It is a matter of\r\nconcern that overfishing continues to take place, in\r\ncontravention of applicable regional conservation\r\nregimes, and that States are not meeting their\r\nobligations to ensure compliance by their flag vessels\r\nand nationals. The implementation of these\r\nAgreements will guarantee the enforcement of the\r\nrights of developing country coastal States. Technical\r\nand financial support must be extended to developing\r\ncountries for capacity-building for development of\r\ntheir fisheries. We further believe that small-scale\r\nfisheries, including subsistence fisheries, should be\r\nprotected, in view of their social and economic\r\nimportance to coastal populations in developing\r\ncountries.\r\nRecognizing that issues relating to oceans and\r\nseas are highly complex and interrelated and need to be\r\nconsidered in an integrated manner, the General\r\nAssembly, highlighting the need to respect the\r\ninternational legal framework established by the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, established\r\nby resolution 54/33 the open-ended informal\r\nconsultative process, in order to facilitate its annual\r\nreview of developments in ocean affairs in an effective\r\nand constructive manner. The first meeting of the\r\nOpen-Ended Informal Consultative Process identified\r\nfor detailed, in-depth consideration the topics of\r\nconservation and management of marine living\r\nresources, including illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fisheries, and marine pollution. For its\r\nsecond meeting the topics of marine science, including\r\ncapacity-building, transfer of technology and piracy\r\nhave been identified for consideration. We note that the\r\neffectiveness and utility of the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess will be reviewed by the General Assembly at\r\nthe fifty-seventh session.\r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh (Viet Nam): First of all,\r\nmy delegation would like to express its appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for the comprehensive and\r\ninformative report contained in document A/55/61. I\r\nwould also like to express our satisfaction with the\r\ntremendous effort and valuable contribution made this\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nyear by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of\r\nthe Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs and other\r\ninternational institutions relating to the questions of\r\noceans and the law of the sea.\r\nViet Nam acknowledges with satisfaction that the\r\nlarge number of States parties to the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the 1994\r\nAgreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nof 10 December 1982 and the 1995 Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December\r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks reflect not only the great significance of the\r\nConvention and its instruments, but also the universal\r\nacceptance of this legal framework. Moreover, they\r\nconstitute a basis for building a new global maritime\r\norder for the international community and play a\r\npivotal role in protecting the marine environment,\r\npreserving marine living resources and promoting the\r\npeaceful settlement of maritime disputes.\r\nWith regard to the institutions established under\r\nthe Convention — namely, the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf — my delegation welcomes the\r\nprogress made in the past year. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the adoption of a set of Regulations on\r\nProspecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules\r\nin the Area by the Assembly of the International\r\nSeabed Authority, which met in Kingston, Jamaica, on\r\n13 July 2000. This is the first code ever elaborated to\r\nregulate activities relating to mineral resources on the\r\nocean bottom beyond the jurisdiction of any nation.\r\nThe new regulations are aimed at protecting deep\r\nseabed resources as the common heritage of mankind.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction that the Authority is now\r\nin a position to proceed to issue contracts for\r\nexploration to registered pioneer investors in\r\naccordance with those regulations.\r\nAt the tenth meeting of the States parties to the\r\nConvention, held in May this year, the budget for the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for 2001\r\nwas adopted. My delegation is encouraged by the\r\nachievements being realized by the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and believes that they\r\nwill continue steadily in the future. It is noteworthy\r\nthat, with the consideration of five cases, more and\r\nmore States are seeking recourse to the Tribunal for the\r\nsettlement of disputes relating to the oceans and seas.\r\nAs a coastal State with a broad continental shelf,\r\nViet Nam attaches great importance to the work of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nSince its establishment in 1997, eight sessions of the\r\nCommission have been held, and the Commission has\r\nmade considerable efforts in its organizational work\r\nand in carrying out its mandate. My delegation believes\r\nthat the amendments to its Rules of Procedure, which\r\nwere adopted during the eighth session, will effectively\r\nenhance the work of the Commission. Likewise, the\r\nadoption of the Scientific and Technical Guidelines\r\nprovides assistance to coastal States on the technical\r\nnature and scope of data and information to be\r\nsubmitted to the Commission. For developing\r\ncountries, training is critical to attain the necessary\r\nskills for preparation of submissions to the\r\nCommission. Therefore, assistance in this field is\r\nurgently needed.\r\nThe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea and its relevant instruments have enjoyed\r\nthe strong and effective support of the Government of\r\nViet Nam. Viet Nam always considers the Convention\r\nas a framework for national, regional and global\r\nactivities in the maritime areas and continental shelves.\r\nIt is of great importance that the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea be seriously\r\nobserved by States parties. Under the Convention,\r\nStates parties, among other things, are to respect other\r\nparties’ sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction\r\nover their maritime areas, continental shelves and\r\nexclusive economic zones. Unilateral activities,\r\ndeclarations and arrangements on the part of States are\r\nrequired to conform strictly to the provisions of the\r\nConvention. Therefore, those that run counter to the\r\nprovisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and its annexes are considered as\r\nnull and void by Viet Nam. Being a State party to the\r\nConvention, Viet Nam always respects the provisions\r\nof the Convention and fulfils its international\r\ncommitments, and it therefore demands that other\r\nparties do likewise.\r\nOn the basis of the provisions of the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the\r\nGovernment of Viet Nam continues to adopt new laws\r\nand regulations and to amend outdated ones to further\r\nthe harmonization between national law and\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\ninternational law of the sea. In implementing its\r\nnational programme of maritime affairs, my\r\nGovernment places high priority on educating the\r\npeople about optimal exploitation as well as about the\r\nmanagement and preservation of marine resources and\r\nthe marine environment.\r\nMy Government also focuses on developing\r\nregional and international cooperation in marine\r\nscientific research and technology transfer, fisheries\r\nand oil exploration and exploitation. Wishing to create\r\na favourable environment based on mutual\r\nunderstanding and confidence for future settlement of\r\ndisputes regarding maritime boundaries in the Eastern\r\nSea (South China Sea), Viet Nam is exerting great\r\nefforts to cooperate with China and with other\r\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) to develop a regional code of\r\nconduct on the South China Sea. We fully support the\r\n1992 ASEAN Declaration and the 1997 ASEAN-China\r\nDeclaration on the principles for resolving disputes in\r\nthe South China Sea.\r\nMy delegation would like to confirm the\r\nwillingness of the Government of Viet Nam to extend\r\nits full cooperation for the effective implementation of\r\nthe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea. We assure the Assembly of our Government’s\r\ncommitment to the promotion of an orderly regime for\r\nthe oceans in a spirit of mutual understanding and\r\ncooperation, as stated in the Convention.\r\nMr. Su Wei (China) (spoke in Chinese): The\r\nChinese delegation wishes at the outset to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on oceans and the law\r\nof the sea (A/55/61), which provides a very useful\r\nbasis for our consideration of the agenda item before\r\nus.\r\nThe world’s oceans and seas are of paramount\r\nimportance to the survival and development of human\r\nsociety. As a populous developing country, China, like\r\nother countries, attaches great importance to the\r\nexploration, utilization and sustainable management of\r\nmarine resources, the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment and marine scientific research. All these\r\nelements have been integrated into our national\r\nstrategy and programme for social and economic\r\ndevelopment. The Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nand other relevant agreements, rules and regulations\r\nconstitute the legal framework for, and the basic\r\ncontent of, modern international law of the sea. More\r\nthan 130 countries have thus far ratified or acceded to\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\r\nand we are proud to be one of them.\r\nNow, I should like to express the views of the\r\nChinese Government on a number of points. First of\r\nall, we highly appreciate the progress made in the work\r\nof the International Seabed Authority. The regulations\r\nfor prospecting and exploration for polymetallic\r\nnodules in the Area, adopted at the sixth session of the\r\nAuthority, held in July this year, further concretized the\r\nconcept of the common heritage of mankind, as\r\nenshrined in the Convention, and provided operational\r\nrules to be followed in the exploration and exploitation\r\nof international seabed resources. At the same time, we\r\nmust realize that the Authority faces a very heavy\r\nworkload in coming years. Not only must it conclude\r\nexploration contracts with the pioneer investors\r\nconcerned, consider exploration applications from\r\nother countries and supervise exploration activities of\r\ncontractors in the Area, but it must also initiate at the\r\nappropriate time the development of regulations on\r\nprospecting for marine resources other than\r\npolymetallic nodules. We look forward to the Authority\r\nfunctioning smoothly and achieving tangible results.\r\nTurning, secondly, to the management and\r\nsustainable exploitation of marine living resources in\r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction, commendable\r\nresults have been achieved over the past few years. The\r\n1995 Agreement for the implementation of provisions\r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea relating to the conservation and management of\r\nstraddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks\r\nrepresents an important complement to and\r\ndevelopment of the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nA number of regional regimes for the conservation and\r\nmanagement of marine living resources are coming\r\ninto being or are being strengthened. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has always highly appreciated the\r\nimportance of the preservation and sustainable\r\nexploitation of marine living resources, and has been\r\nan active participant in the activities of the relevant\r\nfisheries management organizations. We are of the\r\nview that illegal, unregulated, unreported fishing\r\nactivities have a severe adverse impact on the\r\neffectiveness of measures for the sustainable\r\nmanagement and exploitation of marine living\r\nresources. We hope that coordination among United\r\nNations agencies and regional fisheries organizations\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nwill be strengthened so that the problem can be\r\nproperly addressed.\r\nThirdly, I would like to say a few words about the\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea. I wish first of all to\r\ncongratulate the Co-chairpersons on the way in which\r\nthey guided the first meeting of the Informal\r\nConsultative Process, during which useful discussions\r\nwere held and positive progress made on a variety of\r\ntopics, such as fisheries, environmental protection,\r\nscientific research, capacity-building, the suppression\r\nof crime at sea and the strengthening of regional\r\ncooperation. We hope that the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess, in the spirit of resolution 54/33, will include\r\nin-depth discussions on oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nFourthly, we greatly appreciate the work of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The\r\nmanner in which the Tribunal decided the Saiga cases,\r\nthe Southern Bluefin Tuna cases and the Camouco case\r\nbrought by Panama against France clearly illustrates\r\nthe effectiveness of the Tribunal. We hope and believe\r\nthat the Tribunal will play a greater role in the\r\nsettlement of maritime disputes and in the maintenance\r\nof the international maritime order. We warmly\r\ncongratulate the Tribunal on its move to its new\r\npermanent premises, and hope that this will mark a new\r\nstarting point for its work.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, we see an ever\r\ncloser relationship between the oceans and the survival\r\nand development of mankind. Within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\r\nthe international community should make every effort\r\nto ensure that the oceans and seas better serve the\r\ninterests of mankind and help bring about a healthy,\r\nstable international maritime order for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nMr. Suh Dae-won (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation welcomes this annual opportunity to review\r\ndevelopments in the field of oceans and the law of the\r\nsea. The Secretary-General’s report (A/55/61)\r\naccurately reflects the developments that took place\r\nduring the period it covers, providing us with useful\r\nreferences for the consideration of this important\r\nagenda item. My delegation would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General and the staff of the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their arduous\r\nefforts in preparing this comprehensive and informative\r\nreport.\r\nWe take note of another report (A/55/274) before\r\nus this year, submitted by the Co-Chairpersons of the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea for\r\ndeliberation as part of this item. The first meeting of\r\nthe Consultative Process was held from 30 May to\r\n2 June of this year, and my delegation congratulates the\r\nCo-Chairpersons on its successful conclusion.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that international\r\nacceptance of the 1982 United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the Agreement relating to the\r\nimplementation of Part XI of the Convention has\r\nslightly increased over the past year, as three more\r\nStates have acceded to it. The number of States parties\r\nto the Convention has now reached 135, which\r\nrepresents more than two thirds of the members of this\r\nbody. While the gradual increase in the number of\r\nparties to the Convention represents a trend towards\r\nuniversal participation, it is our hope that the\r\nincremental progress towards the goal of universality\r\nwill be accelerated with the ratification or accession of\r\nthe remaining States.\r\nIt is important for the Convention to attain\r\nuniversality and maintain its unified character in order\r\nfor it to develop into an effective global norm that\r\nensures a stable and peaceful maritime order. In this\r\nregard, my delegation fully supports the call in\r\nparagraph 3 of draft resolution A/55/L.10 for the\r\nharmonization of national laws with the provisions of\r\nthe Convention and for its consistent application.\r\nEncircled by seas on three sides, the Republic of Korea\r\nattaches great importance to maritime matters and\r\nconsiders it crucial to interpret and apply the\r\nConvention faithfully in its letter and spirit. We believe\r\nthat as the charter and universal code for ocean affairs,\r\nthe Convention should be fully respected by all\r\nmembers of the international community.\r\nThe three institutions of the Convention, namely\r\nthe International Seabed Authority, the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf, have made\r\nsubstantial progress over the past year, strengthening\r\nand consolidating the institutional basis for their future\r\nactivities. Particularly notable is the approval by the\r\nAuthority of the Regulations on Prospecting and\r\nExploration for Polymetallic Nodules during the\r\nsecond part of its sixth session last July.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nFurthermore, the International Seabed Authority\r\nhas almost completed its administrative work, such as\r\nthe approval of its financial regulations and the\r\nadoption of staff regulations and the rules of the\r\nprocedure of the Legal and Technical Commission. My\r\ndelegation is satisfied with this achievement, which\r\nwill allow the Authority to focus on more substantive\r\nwork in future.\r\nAs a member of the Council of the Authority, the\r\nRepublic of Korea has actively participated in all the\r\nwork of the International Seabed Authority this year,\r\nfulfilling its obligations as a registered pioneer investor\r\nunder the Convention and the Agreement by submitting\r\na periodic report on its activities in the pioneer area\r\nand reporting on the progress of four trainees. My\r\nGovernment is now carefully studying the draft\r\ncontract for exploration prepared by Ambassador Satya\r\nNandan, the Secretary-General of the Authority, and\r\nwill sign it in due course. We believe that the signing\r\nof the contract for exploration by all the registered\r\npioneer investors will mark a milestone in human\r\nefforts to explore the deep seabed, one of the most\r\nprecious common heritages of mankind.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea,\r\nfor its part, has undergone an important change this\r\nyear through its move to a new headquarters built by\r\nthe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.\r\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress its deep gratitude to the German Government\r\nand the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg for their\r\nefforts and dedication to the efficient functioning of the\r\nTribunal. In addition, this year has witnessed another\r\nadjudication by the Tribunal, namely that of the\r\nCamouco case, which concerns article 292 of the\r\nConvention on the prompt release of vessels and crews.\r\nAs the number of cases dealt with by the Tribunal\r\ngrows, its authority concerning the interpretation and\r\napplication of the Convention and the Agreement\r\nseems to be increasingly strengthened. We hope that its\r\nunique role in settling maritime disputes will be\r\nenhanced as more cases are referred to it by States.\r\nWe are also pleased to note that the Commission\r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf has made\r\nheadway this year in its task of assisting coastal States’\r\nsubmissions on the limits of extended continental\r\nshelves under article 76 and annex II of the\r\nConvention.\r\nCrimes at sea — piracy and armed robbery in\r\nparticular — are rampant in certain regions of the\r\nworld and represent a serious threat to the lives of\r\nseafarers, the safety of navigation and the security of\r\ncoastal States. It is particularly worrisome that, despite\r\nefforts by the international community to suppress\r\nthese violent acts, there is still no sign of a significant\r\ndecrease. My delegation fully supports a leading role\r\nfor the International Maritime Organization in this area\r\nand urges the international community, regional\r\norganizations and States in affected regions in\r\nparticular to intensify their efforts to prevent and\r\neradicate piracy and armed robbery at sea, with a\r\nrenewed emphasis on inter-agency and inter-State\r\ncooperation.\r\nDuring the first meeting last May of the United\r\nNations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on\r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea, its focused approach\r\non illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries and the\r\nimpact of marine pollution and degradation in coastal\r\nareas successfully drew the attention of all its\r\nparticipants. In this respect, my delegation welcomes\r\nthe recommendation in paragraph 41 of draft resolution\r\nA/55/L.10, which suggests two agenda items for the\r\nsecond meeting of the Process next year, namely,\r\nmarine science and the development and transfer of\r\nmarine technology, and coordination and cooperation\r\nin combating piracy and armed robbery at sea.\r\nWith the inauguration of the Informal\r\nConsultative Process, the international community has\r\nanother important forum to take stock of the status of\r\nocean affairs and the law of the sea and to seek\r\nsolutions in a concerted manner. My delegation hopes\r\nthat the Process will effectively address the major\r\nchallenges facing humankind in the field of the oceans\r\nand seas with the full participation and cooperation of\r\nStates and international organizations.\r\nMy delegation considers inter-State cooperation\r\nto be indispensable for the secure and effective\r\nimplementation of the Convention at the global and\r\nregional level. In this respect, we welcome the signing,\r\nin early August, of the new fisheries agreement\r\nbetween my country and the People’s Republic of\r\nChina. This agreement will help the conservation and\r\nrational management of fishing stocks in the seas\r\nbetween the two countries. It is also noteworthy that\r\nimportant negotiations on maritime boundary\r\ndelimitation between my country and neighbouring\r\nStates are now under way for the purpose of ensuring\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nthe eventual legal stability of the seas of North-East\r\nAsia within the framework of the Convention.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress the\r\nincreasing importance of the 1982 Convention for all\r\nactivities in the oceans and seas and for the coherent\r\nmanagement of ocean affairs. I would also like to take\r\nthis opportunity to reiterate the willingness of my\r\nGovernment to lend its unreserved support to all the\r\nendeavours by the international community to promote\r\nthe uniform and consistent implementation of the\r\nConvention and to establish a peaceful and orderly\r\nmaritime regime throughout the world in a spirit of\r\nunderstanding and cooperation.\r\nMr. Tupou (Tonga): I have the honour to make\r\nthis statement on behalf of the countries of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum that maintain Permanent Missions at the\r\nUnited Nations in New York: Australia, Fiji, the\r\nMarshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia,\r\nNauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,\r\nSolomon Islands, Vanuatu and my own country, Tonga.\r\nAs the Pacific Group has stated on numerous\r\noccasions, the ocean is of immense importance to us.\r\nThe ocean is our traditional provider, and its bounty\r\ncontinues to be the principal resource for the ongoing\r\nsurvival of many of our people. We are a diverse group\r\nof countries, separated by great distances. Despite this,\r\nwe share a common bond: the Pacific Ocean. While\r\nmany of the countries in our Group have small land\r\nmasses, the countries of the Pacific Islands Forum are\r\nthe custodians of a great expanse of the world’s oceans,\r\nwith our collective exclusive economic zones\r\namounting to more than 30 million square kilometres.\r\nOur joint responsibility over this vast area unites us in\r\na common purpose.\r\nThe Pacific Group has continued over the past\r\nyear to demonstrate its commitment to the Convention\r\nand, more generally, to oceans and sea issues.\r\nDelegations within our Group have been active in\r\nalmost every endeavour currently taking place on the\r\nUnited Nations agenda on oceans and the law of the\r\nsea, and in many instances have taken on active\r\nleadership roles.\r\nOur delegations welcomed the initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General, in the context of the Millennium\r\nSummit, to encourage States to rededicate themselves\r\nto the multilateral treaty framework and thereby\r\ncontribute to advancing the international rule of law by\r\nsigning and ratifying treaties to which they were not\r\nalready party. To assist States, the Secretary-General\r\nidentified a list of 25 core treaties most central to the\r\nspirit and goals of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMany in our Group took this opportunity to enhance\r\nour support for this multilateral framework by signing\r\nand ratifying treaties at the Summit.\r\nWe feel, however, that it is necessary to signal\r\nour view that there was a serious omission from this\r\nlist of core treaties: the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea and its implementing agreements. In our view, no\r\ntreaty is more central to the spirit and goals of the\r\nCharter than the Convention, providing, as it does, a\r\nlegal order for nearly three quarters of the earth’s\r\nsurface, and settling all issues relating to the law of the\r\nsea, including issues of peace and security,\r\nconservation and management of resources and the\r\nstudy and protection of the marine environment, in a\r\nbalanced and integrated manner. We call on all States\r\nthat have not done so to ratify and implement this key\r\ntreaty in order to fulfil the goal of universal\r\nparticipation.\r\nThe members of the Pacific Group are sponsors\r\nof both draft resolutions to be adopted under today’s\r\nagenda item, and we have participated actively in the\r\ninformal consultations on both.\r\nAs we indicated in our statement last year, the\r\nPacific Group considers the annual review by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of developments in oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea to be very important, as the General\r\nAssembly is the only body within the United Nations\r\nsystem that can bring together all the complex and\r\ninterrelated aspects and activities. We thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his annual comprehensive report,\r\nwhich we continue to see as the key to the proper\r\nexercise of the General Assembly’s responsibilities.\r\nOur Group is most satisfied with the\r\ndevelopments that have taken place over the past year\r\nto facilitate this review and enhance the General\r\nAssembly’s ability to maintain an effective overview of\r\nthis important subject matter. We refer, of course, to\r\nthe newly established Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea, also known as UNICPOLOS. We are pleased to\r\nsee from the two draft resolutions that the output of\r\nthis Consultative Process has been very useful to the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the preparation of the draft\r\nresolutions, resulting in more substantive and focused\r\ndrafts. We welcome these developments, while noting\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nthat the draft resolutions remain very firmly within the\r\nframework of the Convention and its implementing\r\nagreements.\r\nThe past year has, as always, been a busy year for\r\nthe institutions established under the Convention and\r\nthe various competent organizations charged by the\r\nConvention with tasks and responsibilities. The Tenth\r\nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention took place\r\nin May under the presidency of Ambassador Peter\r\nDonigi of Papua New Guinea. The Pacific Group notes\r\nwith satisfaction that, in addition to the most important\r\nadministrative tasks assigned to it under the\r\nConvention, the Meeting of States Parties is\r\nincreasingly having to deal with a range of other\r\nimportant issues relating to the Convention. As the\r\nreport of the Tenth Meeting shows, the Meeting of\r\nStates Parties has had considerable discussions on\r\nsubjects such as a trust fund for providing assistance in\r\nproceedings before the Tribunal; financing the\r\nparticipation of members of the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf from developing\r\ncountries; providing technical assistance and training\r\nfor developing States regarding the preparation of\r\nsubmissions to the Commission; and the 10-year time\r\nlimit under article 4 of annex II to the Convention.\r\nThis last issue is of particular interest to a number\r\nof our Group, and we look forward to participating\r\nactively in further discussions on the issue at next\r\nyear’s Meeting of States Parties. In this regard, we also\r\nnote the very useful open meeting of the Commission\r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf held earlier this\r\nyear.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority has also had a\r\nvery productive year. Our Group was very pleased that\r\nthe Council of the Authority, under the presidency of\r\nMr. Sakiusa Rabuka of Fiji, was able to finally\r\nconclude the Regulations on Prospecting and\r\nExploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the Area —\r\nknown informally as the “mining code” — after four\r\nyears of negotiation. We think this is an important\r\nmilestone in the Authority’s endeavours, and urge the\r\nAuthority to now proceed to issue contracts to the\r\nregistered pioneer investors in accordance with the\r\nregulations, so that their activities in the area can be\r\nbrought within the regime as envisaged by the\r\nConvention and the Part XI Agreement. We hope that\r\nthe Secretary General of the Authority will be in a\r\nposition to report to the next session of the Authority\r\nthat these contracts have been concluded. Our\r\ndelegations consider that the Regulations form a sound\r\nbasis for governing prospecting and exploration\r\nactivities in the Area and represent an appropriate\r\nbalance between commercial sense and environmental\r\ncaution. We particularly welcome the fact that in its\r\ndecision adopting the Regulations the Council decided\r\nthat prior to the testing phase, it would consider the\r\nmatter of guarantees to enable the Council to take\r\nimmediate measures to ensure effective protection of\r\nthe marine environment, with a view to adopting an\r\nappropriate form of guarantee to meet this aim.\r\nAs already indicated, the Pacific Group very\r\nmuch welcomes the first meeting of the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea, held in New York from 30 May\r\nto 2 June this year. We are gratified that one of our\r\nGroup, Ambassador Tuiloma Neroni Slade of Samoa,\r\nwas able to contribute to the Consultative Process in\r\nthe capacity of Co-Chairperson, along with Mr. Alan\r\nSimcock of the United Kingdom. In our view, the\r\nConsultative Process got off to a very good start. The\r\nfirst meeting was notable for the quality and breadth of\r\nthe discussions, both in the opening exchanges of\r\nviews and specific discussion panels, and for the\r\ngenuine willingness of participants to engage in the\r\nissues in a cross-cutting, non-sectoral manner. The\r\nareas of focus — “Responsible fisheries and illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fisheries: Moving from\r\nprinciples to implementation” and “Economic and\r\nsocial impacts of marine pollution and degradation,\r\nespecially in coastal areas” — are very pertinent to our\r\nregion. In addition to national delegations, our region\r\nwas represented at the first meeting by a designated\r\nrepresentative of the South Pacific Forum, Mr. Russell\r\nHoworth, of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience\r\nCommission. At the next session we hope to have more\r\nreinforcement from the region. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the establishment of the Trust Fund to assist\r\ndeveloping countries with their attendance at the\r\nConsultative Process.\r\nThe problem of illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing is a very genuine and pressing\r\nconcern for all of us. We therefore place considerable\r\nreliance on the efforts taking place in the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\r\nto adopt a comprehensive international plan of action\r\nto prevent, deter and eliminate these unacceptable\r\nfishing activities, on the basis of a draft prepared at an\r\nexpert meeting hosted in Sydney, Australia, earlier this\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nyear. There is an urgent need for the FAO to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive plan of action involving all relevant\r\nStates, including flag States, port States and market\r\nStates, to ensure that all States take action to see that\r\ntheir nationals and vessels flying their flags do not\r\nsupport or engage in illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing. Accordingly, we were very\r\ndisappointed that the FAO technical consultations held\r\nfrom 2-6 October failed to finalize the plan of action.\r\nClearly, another meeting will be needed if the FAO\r\nCommittee on Fisheries is to be in a position to adopt\r\nthe plan of action in February 2001. We urge all States\r\nto make the successful completion of the plan of action\r\na priority.\r\nWe welcome the recent ratification of the United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement by Barbados and\r\nLuxembourg, and look forward to its imminent entry\r\ninto force. The Agreement is a fundamental part of the\r\ninternational legal architecture for ensuring the\r\nconservation and management of marine living\r\nresources in accordance with the Convention. It is our\r\nfirm view that any regional or subregional fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations or arrangements established\r\nto ensure the long-term conservation of stocks on the\r\nhigh seas and straddling and highly migratory fish\r\nstocks must be established in accordance with the\r\nUnited Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. It is no longer\r\nacceptable to base new regimes for conservation and\r\nmanagement on precedents from old fisheries\r\nmanagement organizations, most of which predate the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment (UNCED), Agenda 21 and the United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement, let alone the 1982\r\nConvention. The world has to move on.\r\nIn the case of the Pacific, six years of hard work\r\nhas finally paid off, and the Convention on the\r\nConservation and Management of Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific was\r\nadopted in Honolulu on 4 September this year. The\r\nConvention, concluded among States in the regions and\r\nfishing States, is firmly based on the United Nations\r\nFish Stocks Agreement and is in full accordance with\r\nit. The Convention’s importance cannot be overstated\r\nin terms of the contribution it will make to the\r\nmaintenance of sustainable fisheries in the regions, an\r\naim which is in the interests of both distant-water\r\nfishing nations and Forum island countries, which are\r\nall small island developing States relying substantially\r\non this one resource for their livelihood. The\r\nConvention gives effect to the United Nations Fish\r\nStocks Agreement and incorporates the principle upon\r\nwhich the Agreement is based, including the\r\nprecautionary approach and the need to protect\r\nbiodiversity.\r\nThe countries of the region and other interested\r\nStates had a unique, one-off opportunity to conclude a\r\nregional management scheme before the stocks came\r\nunder pressure and to ensure their long-term\r\nconservation and sustainability in accordance with the\r\nConvention and the United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement. We are happy to be able to report that this\r\nopportunity has been seized. Now we look forward to\r\nthe timely ratification and entry into force of our\r\nConvention.\r\nMr. Seki (Japan): At the outset, I wish to express\r\nmy Government\u0027s sincere condolences to the family of\r\nMr. Lihai Zhao, a member of the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea, who passed away 10 October.\r\nMy condolences go also to the people and Government\r\nof the People’s Republic of China. We will long\r\nremember Mr. Zhao’s important contributions to the\r\nwork of the Tribunal.\r\nSurrounded by the sea, Japan has a profound\r\ninterest in the sustainable use and development of the\r\nmultitude of benefits and possibilities that the sea has\r\nto offer, and thus attaches great importance to the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nToday we note with satisfaction that 135 States\r\nhave now become parties to the Convention and 99\r\nStates to the Agreement Relating to the Implementation\r\nof Part XI of the Convention. The legitimacy of the\r\nConvention cannot but increase with the addition of\r\nnew States parties, and my delegation appeals to States\r\nthat have not yet done so to become parties to the\r\nConvention, as well as to the Agreement.\r\nIn order to ensure the effective implementation of\r\nthe Convention, it is necessary to maintain the\r\nConvention’s unified character. To that end, my\r\ndelegation would like to emphasize the importance of\r\nharmonizing the national legislation of States parties\r\nwith the provisions of the Convention and to express\r\nthe hope that any declaration or statement that is not in\r\nconformity with the Convention will be withdrawn.\r\nThe United Nations is an important focal point of\r\nefforts in the complex field of oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea, and we highly value the Secretary-General’s\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nreport on the activities in this vast area. We also would\r\nlike to thank the countries that coordinated the draft\r\nresolutions — Guyana, New Zealand and the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nThe draft omnibus resolution A/55/L.10, of which\r\nmy Government is a sponsor, addresses the entire range\r\nof activities covered under the Convention. Allow me\r\nto touch upon some aspects which we believe to be\r\nimportant. First, we welcome the results of the first\r\nmeeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea, sometimes referred to as UNICPOLOS, which was\r\norganized under the able Co-Chairmanship of\r\nAmbassador Slade of Samoa and Mr. Simcock of the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The fact that many of the elements\r\ncoming out of this meeting have been incorporated into\r\nthe draft omnibus resolution demonstrates the\r\nusefulness of the Process, and we look forward to\r\nconstructive discussions at its next meeting.\r\nAsian waters, particularly those of the South\r\nChina Sea and the Strait of Malacca, have been\r\naffected severely by piracy and armed robbery at sea.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the number of incidents is\r\nincreasing and they are becoming more violent.\r\nAppropriate international cooperation is needed to\r\ncombat such crimes, and so we are pleased that the\r\ndraft resolution reflects this issue as one of the priority\r\nareas to be addressed at the next meeting of the\r\ninformal consultative process.\r\nJapan, for its part, has been taking initiatives to\r\ncombat crimes at sea. In March of this year, it hosted\r\nthe International Conference on All Maritime Related\r\nConcerns, Both Governmental and Private, on\r\nCombating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships,\r\nwhich produced the Tokyo Appeal. Government\r\nauthorities from 14 Asian countries and from Hong\r\nKong in China, as well as representatives of the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO) and other\r\nprivate and non-governmental entities, participated in\r\nthat Conference. In April, Japan hosted the Regional\r\nConference on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery\r\nAgainst Ships with the participation of the heads of\r\ncoast guard agencies from the countries of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),\r\nChina, Hong Kong in China, India, the Republic of\r\nKorea and Japan. In the final document, entitled \"Asia\r\nAnti-Piracy Challenges 2000,\" participating authorities\r\nexpressed their intention to promote cooperation in\r\ndealing with the problem of piracy. Japan has also been\r\nsending missions to countries in the region to promote\r\ncooperation and coordination in this area.\r\nAllow me to touch upon the international\r\norganizations established under the Convention. In\r\nrelation to the activities of the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf, my delegation would\r\nlike to note that the deadline for the submission of data\r\nand information for the purpose of establishing the\r\nouter limits of continental shelves beyond 200 nautical\r\nmiles is fast approaching for those States parties for\r\nwhom the Convention entered into force on 16\r\nNovember 1994. In view of the importance of ensuring\r\nthat every State party intending to submit data and\r\ninformation is in a position to do so by the deadline\r\nestablished for it in accordance with the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Convention, we support the\r\nestablishment of a voluntary trust fund to assist\r\ndeveloping States in the preparation of their\r\nsubmissions to the Commission, as proposed in the\r\ndraft omnibus resolution. We would like to thank the\r\nNorwegian delegation for its initiative in proposing the\r\nidea to establish this important trust fund. We would\r\nalso like to stress the importance of bilateral\r\ncooperation to cover the data acquisition phase of the\r\npreparation of submissions. My country has already\r\nbeen extending such cooperation to a number of\r\ncountries.\r\nMy Government attaches great importance to the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes concerning the law of\r\nthe sea through the procedures set out in the\r\nConvention, including the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea when appropriate. From this point\r\nof view, we support the idea of establishing a voluntary\r\ntrust fund for the purpose of assisting countries in the\r\nsettlement of disputes through the Tribunal, and wish\r\nto thank the European Union, and particularly the\r\nUnited Kingdom, for taking the initiative in this regard.\r\nJapan was re-elected as a member of the Council\r\nof the International Seabed Authority in July of this\r\nyear and is grateful to all members of the Authority for\r\ntheir support. We are firmly committed to the\r\nattainment of the goals of the Authority, which has\r\nmoved into the next stage of its work with the\r\nadoption, in July this year, of the Regulations on\r\nProspecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules\r\nin the Area. At the same time, Japan urges States to pay\r\ntheir outstanding assessed contributions without further\r\ndelay in order to solve the financial difficulties that the\r\nAuthority and the Tribunal are facing.\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.42\r\nWhen adopted, the draft omnibus resolution\r\nbefore us will establish four trust funds, some of which\r\nI have already touched upon. Allow me to emphasize\r\nthe importance my Government will attach to\r\ntransparency in the activities of those funds. We expect\r\nthe details of the contributions made to the funds, as\r\nwell as the disbursements from them, to be included in\r\nthe funds’ annual reports, and therefore welcome the\r\ninclusion of provisions to that effect in the terms of\r\nreferences attached to the draft resolution.\r\nBefore I conclude, let me touch briefly upon the\r\nmatter of fisheries and related issues. With the global\r\npopulation surpassing six billion, conservation and\r\nmanagement, as well as the sustainable use of living\r\nmarine resources, are more important than ever for the\r\nsubsistence of the human race. Excess fishing capacity,\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, by-catches,\r\ndiscards and other outstanding issues have been a focus\r\nof discussion for some time. We welcome the efforts\r\nthat are being made in the area of conservation and\r\nmanagement of living marine resources at the national,\r\nregional and subregional levels, as well as by the\r\nUnited Nations system, especially the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\r\nJapan has been constructively addressing outstanding\r\nissues, both as a responsible fishing country and as a\r\nmajor consumer of fisheries products.\r\nJapan believes it is extremely important to build\r\nthe capacities of developing countries in the area of\r\nfisheries in order to achieve the optimal conservation\r\nand rational use of fisheries resources. In 1998 Japan\r\nextended approximately $90 million in grant aid\r\ntoward that end. In addition, we have been providing\r\ntechnical cooperation and making contributions\r\nthrough trust funds to appropriate international and\r\nregional organizations in order to facilitate that\r\nobjective. We hope that other countries, as well as\r\ninternational and regional organizations, will also join\r\nin and reinforce such efforts, taking into account the\r\nvarious developments related to fisheries management\r\nin the FAO.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item for this meeting. We\r\nshall hear the remaining speakers tomorrow, Friday, 27\r\nOctober, at 3 p.m. The first three speakers at that\r\nmeeting will be Brazil, Jamaica and Australia.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
