(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 34 (continued)\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/55/61,\r\nA/55/386)\r\nReport on the work of the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process\r\non Oceans and the Law of the Sea at its first\r\nmeeting (A/55/274)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/55/L.10 and Corr.1 and\r\nA/55/L.11)\r\nMr. Moura (Brazil): The entry into force of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\n(UNCLOS) was a landmark in our recognition of the\r\nneed to act collectively. However, six years later,\r\ndespite the Convention and the international legal\r\nframework that it gave rise to, the implementation and\r\neffective regulation of these arrangements remain\r\nunfulfilled. This state of affairs has to do with the\r\ncomplex legal, economic and environmental issues\r\ninvolved in the governance of the oceans as developing\r\nand developed countries seek to cooperate in the\r\nmanagement of a vast array of interconnected\r\necosystems that have no clear boundaries.\r\nOver the past decade, growing concerns over how\r\nbest to manage activities that can affect the availability\r\nof marine resources, navigation, land-based pollution,\r\ncoastal degradation and climate change have brought to\r\nthe fore three major issues.\r\nThe first major issue includes, inter alia, the need\r\nto promote marine scientific research on issues at the\r\ncentre of our concerns, such as the evaluation of fish\r\nstocks and of non-living marine resources and the\r\ndevelopment of clean technology for exploiting them in\r\na sustainable manner.\r\nFor developing countries such as Brazil, effective\r\ninternational cooperation in the field of marine science\r\noffers an important potential source of technology\r\ntransfer and helps ensure the open circulation of\r\ninformation in areas of great strategic and economic\r\nimportance. In fact, sustainable and environmentally\r\nsafe growth in developing countries is directly linked\r\nto the worldwide diffusion of technical knowledge and\r\nthe transfer of appropriate technology. We therefore\r\nwelcome the focus of the forthcoming meeting of the\r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea on the links\r\nbetween development and technology. By improving\r\ninternational efforts in this field, especially as regards\r\ncapacity-building, we hope to see effective progress in\r\nimplementing Parts XIII and XIV of UNCLOS.\r\nThe second major issue is the lack of financial\r\nresources to fulfil these goals in the fields of scientific\r\nresearch and technology transfer. If safe and efficient\r\ntechnology is to be effectively disseminated, we must\r\nenhance programmes that offer not only technical\r\nassistance, but also financial support, at both the\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nbilateral and multilateral levels. We are therefore\r\npleased that both the Consultative Process and the draft\r\nresolution we shall be adopting make reference to the\r\ncrucial role reserved for international financial\r\ninstitutions and for partnerships with the private sector.\r\nThe decision to set up trust funds is also\r\nwelcome. The resources that will be made available for\r\ndeveloping countries to take part in next year’s\r\nConsultative Process will enhance its effectiveness by\r\nallowing a broader range of delegations and opinions to\r\nbe represented. By the same token, these resources will\r\nconsiderably alleviate the financial burdens on\r\ndeveloping countries of preparing their submissions to\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf\r\nand to the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea.\r\nThe third major issue is the need for an integrated\r\nand internationally coordinated approach. Underlying\r\nmany of the barriers to implementing the provisions of\r\nUNCLOS is the difficulty in coordinating the actions of\r\nGovernments, international agencies and civil society.\r\nWe look forward to the Consultative Process as an\r\nopportunity for an open discussion of how best to\r\nenhance inter-agency coordination and to strengthen\r\nthe structures within the United Nations system.\r\nMy delegation was pleased with the outcome of\r\nlast May’s first meeting of the Consultative Process. It\r\noffered valuable information and insights that I am\r\ncertain will help us to identify ways of better\r\ncoordinating action in two key areas: marine pollution\r\nand fisheries management.\r\nAs concerns marine environment protection, the\r\ndiscussions pointed to the importance of putting into\r\npractice the Global Plan of Action. I am pleased to say\r\nthat, together with Argentina and Uruguay, Brazil is\r\ndeveloping a regional-seas programme that provides\r\nfor coordinated action in our region within the wider\r\nglobal framework. This is a practical example of how\r\nwe can revitalize the Global Programme of Action for\r\nthe Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-\r\nbased Activities, a tool that offers modern and flexible\r\nformulas for cooperation by bringing together the\r\nrelevant organizations and sectors in the integrated\r\nmanagement of marine affairs.\r\nThe discussion on fisheries management\r\nunderscored, likewise, the positive role regional\r\narrangements can have in controlling predatory fishing\r\nand other ecologically unsustainable practices. Yet it\r\nwas also noted that, together with creating new\r\nmechanisms and forums, we must ensure that the\r\navailable international regulatory instruments are fully\r\ncomplied with and improved. We therefore look\r\nforward to seeing progress in the implementation of the\r\nagreements on straddling fish stocks and highly\r\nmigratory fish stocks, the Code of Conduct for\r\nResponsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on the Management of\r\nFishing Capacity.\r\nThe Consultative Process was not, however, the\r\nonly positive development over the last year in ocean\r\naffairs. We welcome the adoption last July by the\r\nAssembly of the International Seabed Authority of the\r\nRegulations on Prospecting and Exploration for\r\nPolymetallic Nodules in the Area. This opens the way\r\nfor the rational and sustainable exploitation of these\r\nshared resources.\r\nThe recent inauguration of the headquarters of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in\r\nHamburg will ensure that it will be fully able to\r\ndischarge its important role in the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes.\r\nFinally, the open meeting last May of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf\r\ncontributed to enhancing general awareness of the\r\nassistance the Commission can offer to States in\r\npreparing their submissions.\r\nAs a result of the Consultative Process, of which\r\nBrazil was a sponsor, we believe that our debate today\r\nhas been enriched and better focused. We therefore\r\nlook forward to the ongoing discussion at all levels on\r\nhow to ensure the sustainable management of our vast\r\nbut ever more finite marine resources.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on agenda item 34, “Oceans and the law of the\r\nsea,” on behalf of the 14 member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) that are members\r\nof the United Nations. We associate ourselves with the\r\nstatement made earlier by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Samoa on behalf of the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States.\r\nNearly 18 years ago, on 10 December 1982, the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was\r\nopened for signature in Montego Bay, Jamaica, after 14\r\nyears of work involving more than 150 countries. The\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nadoption of the Montego Bay Convention was a signal\r\nachievement. It represented the recognition by the\r\ninternational community of the central importance of\r\noceans and seas to the productive existence of the\r\nworld’s peoples and to the well-being of future\r\ngenerations. It expressed the commitment of the\r\ncommunity of nations to more effective management\r\nand protection of the resources and services of the\r\nworld’s oceans and seas, and it ensured attention to\r\nequity and justice in the exploitation of the shared\r\npatrimony by present and succeeding generations.\r\nCARICOM States take this opportunity to\r\nunderscore the importance that they attach to the\r\nMontego Bay Convention as the comprehensive legal\r\nframework for governance of the oceans and as the\r\nseminal work in which all instruments and organs\r\naddressing ocean affairs must be grounded. Indeed, the\r\ndrafters of the Convention saw the need to create three\r\ninstitutions to ensure the proper implementation of the\r\nConvention: the International Seabed Authority, the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nFor us it is extremely important that the integrity of the\r\nConvention and the institutions created by it are\r\nmaintained.\r\nCARICOM States have over the years\r\nparticipated actively in the annual consideration and\r\nreview of developments relating to ocean affairs and\r\nthe law of the sea by the General Assembly as the\r\nglobal institution having the competence to undertake\r\nsuch a review. We see the Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea, established by resolution 54/33, as a mechanism to\r\nsupport the annual review by improving coordination\r\nand cooperation, while respecting the competence of\r\nthe institutions of the Convention. We therefore\r\nwelcome the fact that the second meeting of the\r\nConsultative Process will focus on marine science and\r\nthe development and transfer of marine technology.\r\nWe wish, through you, Mr. President, to thank the\r\nDivision of Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for\r\nthe valuable work done to coordinate and disseminate\r\ninformation in this area. We continue to stress the\r\nimportance of training in all matters related to oceans\r\nand the law of the sea, specifically for developing\r\nStates. The benefit of the Division’s TRAIN-SEA-\r\nCOAST programme, which is supported by the United\r\nNations Development Programme, is worthy of\r\nmention. We encourage the Division to expand this\r\nprogramme to other countries.\r\nWe also wish to thank the many States that have\r\ncontributed to the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe\r\nMemorial Fellowship Programme on the Law of the\r\nSea, which is intended to promote a wider appreciation\r\nof the Convention and to enhance specialized\r\nexperience in ocean law, maritime affairs and related\r\ndisciplines. We urge States and others in a position to\r\ndo so to assist in the expansion of this valuable\r\nprogramme in order to respond to the high number of\r\napplications received from deserving candidates. We\r\nare pleased that a national of a CARICOM State —\r\nBarbados — was a recipient of last year’s fellowship.\r\nCARICOM States welcome the report of the\r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/55/61,\r\nwhich addresses, in detail, the developments towards\r\nimplementation of the Convention and the 1994\r\nAgreement, and which reports on the work undertaken\r\nduring the past year by the institutions created under\r\nthe Convention.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority has been\r\ncharged, under part XI of the Convention, with\r\norganizing and controlling the exploration and\r\nexploitation of the non-living resources of the seabed\r\nand ocean floor and subsoil beyond the limits of\r\nnational jurisdiction. This body is unique, since it will\r\nnot only oversee the activities in the Area by\r\ncontractors, but will also engage in exploration and\r\nexploitation of the area through its enterprise. It is\r\nthrough the Authority that States parties to the\r\nConvention will ensure that the oceans and seas beyond\r\nthe limits of national jurisdiction remain the common\r\nheritage of mankind.\r\nWe therefore welcome the achievements of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority during its sixth session,\r\nheld in March and July of this year. We are extremely\r\npleased that the Regulations on Prospecting and\r\nExploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the Area were\r\nadopted by the Council and the Assembly in July. We\r\nconsider this a significant step in the work of the\r\nAuthority, as the way has now been paved for the\r\nAuthority to enter into contracts with the registered\r\npioneer investors for the exploration of the Area. We\r\nnote that draft contracts have already been forwarded\r\nto the pioneer investors and the Authority is awaiting\r\nthe information required under the regulations,\r\nincluding the five-year programme of work, to be\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nprovided by the pioneer investors. We urge a prompt\r\nresponse from the investors and the expeditious\r\nexecution of the contracts. We also welcome the\r\nadoption of the rules of procedure of the Legal and\r\nTechnical Commission of the Authority.\r\nLet me take this opportunity, on behalf of\r\nCARICOM, to congratulate Mr. Satya Nandan on his\r\nre-election as Secretary-General of the Authority. We\r\noffer him our continued assistance and full\r\ncooperation. CARICOM States attach great importance\r\nto the Authority and its organs, and we are pleased that\r\nthree CARICOM States are now represented on the\r\nCouncil: Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica.\r\nThere is still much work to be done by the\r\nAuthority. Indeed, it should be recalled that at the\r\nresumed fourth session of the Authority, held in 1998,\r\nthe Russian Federation referred to evidence of\r\npolymetallic sulphides and cobalt-bearing crusts in the\r\nArea and requested that the Authority begin drafting\r\nregulations for the prospecting and exploration of these\r\nminerals. Members will be aware that once such a\r\nrequest is made, the regulations should be completed\r\nwithin three years of the request. The Authority will\r\ntherefore have to work assiduously to ensure that these\r\nregulations are drafted and concluded by the end of\r\n2001. The Authority will also have to adopt the\r\nenvironmental guidelines which are referred to in\r\nregulation 32 of the recently adopted Regulations and\r\nwhich are currently being reviewed by the Legal and\r\nTechnical Commission.\r\nWe therefore wish to emphasize the need for\r\nStates parties to the Convention to attend and\r\nparticipate in the meetings of the Authority to ensure\r\nthe successful completion of its work. We are very\r\nconcerned that, because of the financial constraints\r\nfaced by many States, developing country participation\r\nin the fundamental work being undertaken by the\r\nAuthority has been severely constrained. The\r\nimportance of effective developing country\r\nparticipation, if we are to ensure equity in the benefits\r\nto be derived from the exploitation of this common\r\nheritage of mankind, cannot be overemphasized.\r\nOver the past years the Authority has organized\r\nworkshops on the non-living resources of the seabed\r\nand the environmental effects of seabed mining. Some\r\nof these workshops have been held in conjunction with\r\nmeetings of the Authority in an effort to encourage\r\nwide participation and to disseminate information for\r\nthe benefit of all States. Unfortunately, as I stated\r\nearlier, developing country participation at the\r\nmeetings of the Authority, and thus at the workshops,\r\nhas been limited by financial constraints. We would\r\ntherefore give very strong support for the Authority’s\r\nconsideration of the establishment of a voluntary trust\r\nfund to facilitate developing country participation in\r\nthese meetings and workshops and to contribute to the\r\nbuilding-up of knowledge and expertise of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nCARICOM States welcome the continued\r\ndevelopment of the jurisprudence of the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. The Tribunal is\r\nfundamental in settling disputes regarding the\r\ninterpretation and application of the Convention. It is\r\nunique in that it has special competence to hear\r\napplications for the prompt release of vessels and\r\ncrews and to deal with requests for provisional\r\nmeasures. The Tribunal is integral to the realization by\r\nStates of the common heritage, since it is the only\r\nbody, through its Seabed Disputes Chamber, to which\r\ndisputes relating to the Area may be submitted. We are\r\ntherefore pleased to note that States are recognizing the\r\njurisdiction of the Tribunal and have submitted their\r\ndisputes to this body.\r\nAt this time CARICOM States wish to express\r\nour condolences to the Tribunal and to the Government\r\nand people of China on the loss of Judge Lihai Zhao in\r\nOctober of this year. We recognize the invaluable\r\ncontribution to the Tribunal and to international law\r\nwhich he made — in particular, to the law of the sea.\r\nCARICOM States welcome progress made by the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in\r\nassisting States parties in preparing submissions in\r\nrespect of the outer limits of the extended continental\r\nshelf. We underscore the need for training in the\r\npreparation of submissions for developing States with\r\nlimited technical capacity. We are therefore pleased\r\nthat the Commission has adopted the outline for the\r\nfirst such training programme, and we look forward to\r\nits implementation.\r\nWe share the concerns of other Member States\r\nregarding the ability of developing countries, in\r\nparticular, to comply with the 10-year time limit for\r\nsubmissions to the Commission, established under\r\narticle 4 of annex II to the Convention. CARICOM\r\nStates would be willing to participate in any discussion\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nrelating to the constraints of the time limits imposed by\r\nthe Convention.\r\nCARICOM States also note with appreciation the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on progress in the protection\r\nand preservation of the marine environment. The\r\nConvention recognizes the importance of protecting\r\nand preserving the marine environment and, in part\r\nXII, stipulates a range of measures through which\r\nStates may achieve this objective. As small island and\r\ncoastal States, CARICOM States are heavily dependent\r\non, and influenced by, the coastal and marine\r\nenvironment. Issues related to integrated ocean and\r\ncoastal zone management are inextricably linked to the\r\nbroader objective of sustainable development,\r\nespecially as regards the challenge of ensuring the\r\nwell-being of the population, particularly coastal\r\ncommunities and industries, while promoting healthy,\r\nviable and productive coastal and marine space.\r\nOur States are particularly exposed to the\r\ninfluence of natural phenomena, which play a principal\r\nrole in the deterioration of coastal and marine\r\nenvironments. The devastating effect of such events as\r\nfloods, hurricanes, climate change and sea-level rise on\r\nsmall island and coastal States must be emphasized.\r\nOur vulnerability to these natural hazards has\r\ncompounded the challenge which our Governments\r\nface in achieving sustainable development through\r\neffective ocean and coastal zone management.\r\nCARICOM States are therefore concerned with\r\nthe protection of our regional marine space — the\r\nwider Caribbean Sea. The need for an effective\r\nregional regulatory mechanism for sustainable fisheries\r\nand the need to ensure adequate protection of our\r\nfragile marine ecosystems from harmful effects such as\r\noil spills and pollution from hazardous and nuclear\r\nwaste are matters to which our States continue to attach\r\nhigh priority.\r\nCARICOM is now seeking to put in place a\r\ncomprehensive, multidimensional regime for the\r\nmanagement and protection of the resources of the\r\nCaribbean Sea. To this end, CARICOM will be\r\nintroducing a draft resolution in the Second\r\nCommittee, and we look forward to receiving the full\r\nsupport of all Member States.\r\nWe also note the progress made in the\r\ndevelopment and management of marine resources,\r\nparticularly fisheries, as stated in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General. We continue to collaborate in\r\nfisheries management and development through the\r\nCARICOM Fisheries Resource Assessment and\r\nManagement Programme (CFRAMP), and we wish to\r\ntake this opportunity to express our appreciation to the\r\nGovernment of Canada for its continued support for the\r\nprogramme, from which our region benefits\r\nsignificantly.\r\nFisheries management, particularly monitoring\r\nand information systems, have improved under\r\nCFRAMP. However, further development of capacity\r\nfor more effective management of the information\r\nrequired under the United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement and the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\nof the United Nations (FAO) Compliance Agreement is\r\nneeded. We look forward to progress in meeting this\r\nchallenge in the future.\r\nGlobal overfishing and overcapacity should not\r\nbe used to justify management measures and capacity\r\nreduction inappropriate for small developing countries.\r\nAlthough this is the purview of the FAO, the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea provides the\r\nframework for all aspects governing the oceans and the\r\nseas. The United Nations should therefore play an\r\nintegral role in ensuring that developing countries are\r\nafforded equal opportunity in the global management\r\nand sustainable development of marine living\r\nresources.\r\nOf critical importance is the need for new\r\napproaches to marine science, technology and\r\nmanagement which take into account the needs and\r\nconcerns of developing countries, including small\r\nisland developing States. Marine scientific research\r\nand technology must take appropriate scale and context\r\ninto account. CARICOM States underscore the\r\nimportance of the transfer of marine science and\r\ntechnology, and we stress the need for these issues to\r\nbe addressed in a meaningful way by the United\r\nNations system and the international community as a\r\nwhole.\r\nAnother challenge faced by CARICOM States\r\ncontinues to be the cost of effective participation in the\r\nregional and international forums at which issues\r\nrelating to oceans and the law of the sea are addressed.\r\nRepresentation at meetings is still inadequate, and this\r\nis reflected in the limited benefits which accrue to our\r\nmember States.\r\nIn conclusion, CARICOM again emphasizes the\r\nimportance of the oceans and seas, particularly for us\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nas small island and coastal States. The Montego Bay\r\nConvention has been widely accepted, and even those\r\nStates that are not parties acknowledge that it is the\r\noverall legal framework governing all aspects of ocean\r\nspace. We wish to encourage those States which have\r\nnot yet done so to become parties to the Convention\r\nand its related Agreements as soon as possible.\r\nMs. Steains (Australia): Australia wishes at the\r\noutset to associate itself fully with the statement made\r\nyesterday by the Permanent Representative of Tonga on\r\nbehalf of the countries of the Pacific Islands Forum.\r\nThe members of the Pacific Islands Forum share a\r\nnumber of important common interests, not least in\r\nrespect of the conservation, management and\r\nsustainable development of the marine living resources\r\nof the Pacific Ocean and other issues relating to the\r\noceans and seas more generally. Australia attaches\r\nimportance to its members of the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nand is pleased that the Forum’s close cooperation in the\r\nvital area of the oceans and the seas has been evident\r\nonce again in this past year.\r\nAustralia once again underlines the critical\r\nimportance of the 1982 United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the pivotal role it has played in\r\nthe development of maritime space regulation since its\r\nentry into force in 1994. The Convention and the\r\ninstitutions created by it form the very foundations\r\nupon which Australia approaches maritime space.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nplays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the\r\nConvention as a whole. We congratulate the Tribunal\r\non the expeditious delivery of its orders and\r\njudgements in the five cases it has already heard and on\r\nthe conclusion of the agreement with its host country,\r\nGermany, that has enabled it to move into its splendid\r\nnew premises. Australia hopes to ratify the Agreement\r\non the Privileges and Immunities of the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea by the end of this year\r\nor early in the new year. Australia also welcomes the\r\nestablishment of a trust fund, set out in draft resolution\r\nA/55/L.10, to increase access to the Tribunal for\r\ndeveloping countries. We regard this as a vital step in\r\nenhancing the Tribunal’s central role in the area of\r\ndispute resolution.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority achieved a\r\nmilestone in July this year with its adoption of the\r\nRegulations on Prospecting and Exploration for\r\nPolymetallic Nodules in the Area. Australia is pleased\r\nwith this outcome and will continue to discharge with\r\ndiligence its duties as a member of the Council of the\r\nAuthority. We also wish to congratulate Ambassador\r\nSatya Nandan on his unanimous re-election as\r\nSecretary-General of the Authority.\r\nAustralia welcomes the dialogue initiated with\r\nStates parties by the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, through its first open meeting held\r\nearlier this year. Such initiatives are clearly beneficial\r\nboth to the Commission and to the States intending to\r\nmake submissions on the outer limits of their extended\r\ncontinental shelves, in accordance with article 76 of the\r\nConvention, and we thank the Commission for its\r\nconscientious and focused work in this regard.\r\nAustralia continues to value this annual review by\r\nthe General Assembly of developments in oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea, and we thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive report.\r\nLast year Australia co-sponsored resolution\r\n54/33, which established the United Nations Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea, and was pleased to participate in May this year in\r\nthe first meeting of this Process. Improved\r\ncoordination and cooperation between the relevant\r\nUnited Nations agencies with competence in oceans\r\nand law of the sea issues, and between such agencies\r\nand member States, is crucial to the integrated\r\nmanagement of the world’s oceans. The first meeting\r\nof the Informal Consultative Process, which focused on\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and on\r\nmarine pollution, demonstrated the usefulness of this\r\ninitiative, as is evident in the two draft resolutions\r\nbefore us today. Australia looks forward to\r\nstrengthening the Informal Consultative Process, and\r\nencourages all States to participate fully in this forum.\r\nLet me now turn to an area of particular concern\r\nto Australia: fisheries. Australia believes that becoming\r\na party to the Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the Convention relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and\r\nbecoming a party to the Agreement to Promote\r\nCompliance with International Conservation and\r\nManagement Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High\r\nSeas are the two most useful legal steps that States\r\ninterested in fisheries can take to ensure the\r\nsustainability of the resource. The United Nations Fish\r\nStocks Agreement in particular is a significant\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nachievement, establishing as it does a progressive and\r\ncomprehensive framework to better conserve and\r\nmanage the world’s major fisheries, many of which are\r\nunder threat. It is therefore unfortunate that some\r\nStates appear less than committed to it. Australia calls\r\non all States that have not already done so to take the\r\nnecessary steps to become parties to the Agreement.\r\nAustralia itself has done so and is working through its\r\ninternal procedures towards acceptance of the\r\nCompliance Agreement of the United Nations Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO). We sincerely\r\nhope that when we next meet on this topic both\r\nAgreements will have entered into force generally.\r\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\r\ncontinues to represent a serious threat to the world’s\r\nmarine ecosystems. It has the potential to undermine\r\nthe efforts of regional fisheries management\r\norganizations and is a major obstacle to achievement of\r\nthe objective, contained both in the Convention and in\r\nthe United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, of\r\nconservation and sustainable management of marine\r\nliving resources. Unfortunately, such fishing occurs in\r\nvirtually all fisheries. It is now clear that concerted\r\ninternational action is urgently needed to address and,\r\nin time, to eliminate this practice. Indeed, Australia\r\nconsiders the inclusion of a number of important\r\nreferences to illegal, unreported and unregulated\r\nfishing in this year’s draft resolution on fisheries to be\r\none of the many positive and significant aspects of the\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nAustralia welcomes the work being undertaken\r\nunder the aegis of FAO to develop a comprehensive\r\ninternational plan of action to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nAustralia has supported these efforts from the outset,\r\nand was pleased to host, in cooperation with the FAO, a\r\nconsultation of experts, drawn from a wide range of\r\nStates, on the subject of such fishing. It took place in\r\nSydney in May this year. We believe that this meeting\r\nproved a useful preparation for the FAO consultation\r\nheld in Rome from 2 to 6 October.\r\nAustralia was disappointed that the consultation\r\nin Rome was unable to finalize a draft international\r\nplan of action. Australia urges all Member States to\r\ncooperate, as a matter of priority, in the adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive international plan of action that\r\ncontains a broad range of actions to deter, prevent and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nSpecifically, this must include not only an emphasis on\r\nstrengthening the exercise of flag State jurisdiction, but\r\nalso port State controls, coastal State controls, market\r\nState controls and controls on nationals. Australia has\r\nutilized all of these controls on a domestic basis, but\r\nthese actions must be translated into multilateral action\r\nin order to be truly effective.\r\nOn this point, Australia wishes to note an\r\nimportant and innovative multilateral initiative to\r\nprevent illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing —\r\nthe adoption by the Commission for the Conservation\r\nof Antarctic Marine Living Resources late last year of\r\na trade documentation scheme for toothfish, a species\r\non the brink of commercial extinction. This scheme, a\r\nmultilateral trade measure that is consistent with the\r\nWorld Trade Organization Agreement, has shown early\r\nsigns of success in reducing the economic incentives\r\nfor illegal fishing in the southern oceans. Australia\r\nbelieves that it also provides a useful model for broader\r\ninternational action on illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing.\r\nIt is a source of regret to Australia that, for the\r\nfirst time ever in the history of the General Assembly’s\r\nconsideration of this agenda item, a vote will be\r\nrequested on the draft resolution on fisheries. The\r\nimportance to humankind as a whole of the\r\nconservation, management and sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the world’s living marine resources —\r\nan issue of particular importance to developing coastal\r\nand small island States, for which the ocean’s resources\r\nare the principal source for their ongoing survival —\r\nhas been recognized over the years by the draft\r\nresolution’s traditional adoption by consensus. To\r\nbreak with this tradition is a regrettable action that\r\nrisks undermining the positive and constructive\r\ndevelopments that have taken place over the years,\r\nthrough the dedication and cooperation of all interested\r\ndelegations, both developing and developed alike.\r\nIn this regard, Australia wishes to clarify some\r\nmisunderstandings that appear to have arisen in respect\r\nof the preambular paragraph concerning one of the\r\nregional fisheries management agreements concluded\r\nearlier this year. Indeed, we wish to note in this context\r\nthat, although the United Nations Fish Stocks\r\nAgreement has regrettably not yet entered into force, it\r\nhas already had a positive impact. Australia is pleased\r\nto have been a participant in the negotiation of the first\r\nregional fisheries management agreement to be\r\nnegotiated under the framework of the United Nations\r\nFish Stocks Agreement.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nThe Convention for the Conservation of Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central\r\nPacific, which was adopted at Honolulu in September\r\nthis year, establishes a framework for the conservation\r\nand management of the world’s last great tuna fishery\r\nthat had not been subject to regional management. That\r\nConvention provides a model for cooperation to ensure\r\nthat these resources are sustainably conserved and\r\nmanaged for the benefit of present and future\r\ngenerations. However, it will require the participation\r\nin the Convention of all those with major interests in\r\nthe region if we are to achieve that result. Both the\r\nCentral and Western Pacific Fisheries Convention and\r\nthe Preparatory Commission remain open to those\r\nStates that at the last moment chose not to support final\r\nagreement, and Australia urges those States to join with\r\nothers in the Pacific region in working together to\r\nachieve our common objectives.\r\nAll of the participants in the process — which\r\nincluded coastal States located in the Western and\r\nCentral Pacific, and States fishing for the relevant\r\nstocks in the region — agreed in the Majuro\r\nDeclaration of June 1997 that the Agreement for the\r\nimplementation of the provisions of United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea relating to the\r\nconservation and management of straddling fish stocks\r\nand highly migratory fish stocks was the foundation of\r\nthe process. Indeed, the participants declared their\r\ncommitment to establish a mechanism for the\r\nconservation of highly migratory fish stocks in the\r\nregion in accordance with the Convention and the\r\nUnited Nations fish stocks Agreement. Further, the\r\nCentral and Western Pacific Fisheries Convention, in\r\nits article 2, provides that\r\n“The objective of this Convention is to\r\nensure, through effective management, the long-\r\nterm conservation and sustainable use of highly\r\nmigratory fish stocks in the Western and Central\r\nPacific Ocean in accordance with the 1982\r\nConvention and the Agreement”.\r\nBut the clinching argument is the savings clause\r\nof article 4, which provides that\r\n“Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice\r\nthe rights, jurisdiction and duties of States under\r\nthe 1982 Convention and the Agreement. This\r\nConvention shall be interpreted and applied in the\r\ncontext of and in a manner consistent with the\r\n1982 Convention and the Agreement.”\r\nThus, even if by some chance a particular\r\nprovision standing alone could be interpreted in a way\r\nthat rendered it inconsistent with the United Nations\r\nfish stocks Agreement, that savings clause would\r\nensure that such an interpretation was eschewed in\r\nfavour of one that maintained its compatibility with the\r\nConvention and the fish stocks Agreement.\r\nSo, quite apart from the incongruity of States that\r\nhave not ratified the United Nations fish stocks\r\nAgreement posing as its defenders vis-à-vis others that\r\nhave, particularly when we are in agreement on the\r\nfundamental principles that are at stake, the basis on\r\nwhich they do so is, I regret to say, misconceived.\r\nNo multilaterally negotiated text is ever\r\ncompletely satisfactory to all parties to its\r\ndevelopment, and that is equally true of both the\r\ncurrent draft resolution on fisheries (A/55/L.11) and\r\nthe Central and Western Pacific Fisheries Convention.\r\nBut that is the very essence of compromise, and both\r\ndocuments are the product of just that. It is too easy to\r\nwithhold support because this or that aspect is not\r\nentirely as we would wish it; Australia too could do so.\r\nBut if we all fell into such an all-or-nothing mentality,\r\nthis Organization would achieve far less than it\r\ncurrently manages to achieve. In that context, we recall\r\nthat towards the very end of the recent informal\r\nconsultations on the draft resolution on fisheries, the\r\nparticipants in the negotiations were extremely close to\r\nconsensus agreement, with only one delegation\r\nstanding outside that consensus. We therefore appeal to\r\nthe State intending to abstain in the vote not to turn its\r\nback on the draft resolution. That is no solution to the\r\nproblems faced by world fisheries today and would do\r\nnothing to promote the cooperative spirit, on the part of\r\nall, that is required to resolve them. As one of its\r\nsponsors, Australia urges all Member States to\r\nunderline their commitment to cooperation by\r\nsupporting the draft resolution when the Assembly\r\ntakes action upon it.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): My country has\r\nalways demonstrated its firm commitment to the norms\r\nand principles of the 1982 United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea. By ratifying the Convention last\r\nyear, Ukraine strengthened its involvement in the\r\nstrategic legal framework governing activities in the\r\noceans and seas. In spite of the fact that it only recently\r\nbecame a party to the Convention, Ukraine has been\r\neffectively implementing it for many years and has\r\naccumulated substantial experience in this field. We\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nhave already emphasized on previous occasions the\r\npoint that the General Assembly is the global\r\ninstitution which has the competence to review ocean\r\naffairs in a coordinated manner, integrating all aspects\r\nof ocean use: political, legal, economic, social,\r\nenvironmental and technical. No other institution is in\r\na position to have an overview of the holistic nature of\r\nocean-related matters, which must be considered in a\r\nholistic manner. We consider the annual discussion of\r\nthe present item in plenary meetings of the General\r\nAssembly to be extremely important.\r\nUkraine strongly believes that the role of such a\r\npowerful legal instrument as the Convention in\r\nmanaging ocean affairs should be further promoted and\r\nstrengthened. We support all efforts aimed at exploring\r\navenues that could contribute to the strict\r\nimplementation of its provisions. The United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea appears to be a very timely and\r\npotentially useful arrangement in that regard. Ukraine\r\nwelcomes the establishment of the Consultative\r\nProcess. We also welcome the discussion on marine\r\nscience and piracy that is to take place next year during\r\nthe Consultative Process. We share the views expressed\r\nby Rear Admiral James S. Carmichael, the\r\nrepresentative of the United States, who emphasized\r\nyesterday the importance of the coupled ocean-\r\natmosphere system and the sharing of data and\r\ninformation resulting from scientific research on the\r\nmarine environment. Ukraine is also involved in the\r\nGlobal Ocean Observing System, partly through the\r\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific\r\nOrganization, and partly through other channels.\r\nI would like to stress that the debate by States and\r\ninternational organizations in that informal forum on a\r\nnumber of issues relating to the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nother international legal instruments related to the law\r\nof the sea is a useful continuation of the discussions\r\nthat take place within the framework of the plenary\r\nmeetings of the General Assembly. At the same time, I\r\nwant to emphasize that the Consultative Process should\r\nbe more structured, and that it should be aimed at\r\nachieving practical results.\r\nUkraine fully shares the concern expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General in paragraph 120 of his report on\r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/55/61) that over-\r\nexploitation of marine living resources through excess\r\nfishing capacity continues to be of grave concern to the\r\ninternational community. We place special emphasis\r\nalso on the problem of the prevalence of illegal,\r\nunregulated or unreported fisheries. Such activities are\r\nin fact not only detrimental to fish stocks as such, but\r\nalso seriously affect the management of marine living\r\nresources by coastal States.\r\nAs a country suffering from the depletion of the\r\nfish stocks of its exclusive economic zone, Ukraine is\r\nextremely interested in addressing that problem. In\r\nmost cases, it is non-compliance with the regime of the\r\nexclusive economic zone that stands as a major\r\ncontributing factor to the problem. The United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea clearly outlined the\r\nsovereign rights of coastal States for the purpose of\r\nexploring, exploiting, conserving and managing living\r\nnatural resources. It is the coastal State that determines\r\nthe allowable catch of living resources in its exclusive\r\neconomic zone and decides whether to give foreign\r\nfishing vessels access to the surplus of the allowable\r\ncatch. Other States and their nationals fishing in\r\nexclusive economic zones are obliged to comply with\r\nconservation measures and with the laws and\r\nregulations of the coastal State in question. Any non-\r\ncompliance with this established legal regime on the\r\npart of foreign fishers not only circumvents the\r\nrelevant principles and norms of the Convention but\r\nalso constitutes a violation of national law and\r\ntherefore entails responsibility under that law. Ukraine\r\nwishes to stress that the coastal State is entitled to use\r\nall means provided for under international law, and the\r\nConvention in particular, including enforcement\r\nmeasures such as boarding, inspection, arrest and\r\njudicial proceedings, to deter and penalize such illegal\r\nactivities.\r\nThe increased incidence of illegal practices in\r\nexclusive economic zones makes obvious the urgent\r\nneed for better cooperation between interested States to\r\nprevent illegal, unregulated and unreported fisheries.\r\nAs a country with responsible fishery traditions,\r\nUkraine is particularly interested in developing\r\ncooperation with the regional fisheries organizations.\r\nAt the same time, it is worth mentioning that many\r\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\r\ntransition wishing to cooperate with regional closed-\r\nmembership groups quite often face difficulties in\r\nmeeting the too stringent requirements of such\r\norganizations. Such isolation from the regional legal\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nregimes may have undesirable and detrimental\r\nconsequences.\r\nOn the other hand, the restrictive character of\r\ncollective measures taken within the framework of\r\nregional fisheries organizations means that they do not\r\nalways fully correspond to the real needs of the rational\r\nexploitation and conservation of marine living\r\nresources. Those measures are sometimes implicitly\r\naimed at meeting the interests of a limited group of\r\ncountries, while the interests of other countries, in\r\nparticular those of distant fishery States, suffer from\r\neconomic dislocation.\r\nI call upon the regional fisheries organizations to\r\nenhance their cooperation with more States, in\r\nparticular distant water-fishing States and\r\ngeographically disadvantaged States, in adopting and\r\nimplementing measures aimed at the rational\r\nexploitation, management and conservation of marine\r\nliving resources.\r\nMy delegation considers the results of the Tenth\r\nMeeting of States Parties, held in New York in May, to\r\nbe very positive. We support, in particular, the\r\nrecommendations of that meeting to the General\r\nAssembly, which are included in the draft resolution\r\nunder discussion. We welcome the recommendation in\r\nthe draft resolution to establish the four voluntary trust\r\nfunds. I take great pleasure in congratulating Norway\r\non its decision to make an initial contribution of $1\r\nmillion, subject to parliamentary approval, to the trust\r\nfund for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of\r\nsubmissions to the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf by developing States, in particular\r\nthe least developed countries and small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nUnfortunately, as with many countries with\r\neconomies in transition, Ukraine will probably not be\r\nable to make any substantial contributions to the fund.\r\nHowever, I am about to suggest to my capital that we\r\nstudy the feasibility of sharing with developing\r\ncountries, especially small island developing States,\r\nthe information databases and charts which Ukrainian\r\nships have collected over the years in the world’s\r\noceans. In the 1970s and 1980s probably the greatest\r\nproportion of the oceanographic and marine scientific\r\nresearch vessels of the former Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics was operated under the auspices of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences of Ukraine.\r\nI should also like to add that at one time, 36\r\noceanographic vessels sailed to the Southern Ocean,\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, and, in particular, the Indian\r\nOcean, from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. These vessels\r\nconducted research in all fields of marine science.\r\nThose which remain in operation — although many\r\nfewer than the original 36 — could be made available\r\nthrough bilateral arrangements with interested States to\r\nconduct exploratory work on the extended continental\r\nshelf in these and other areas.\r\nWe also welcome the inclusion of the new item\r\non the agenda for discussion at the next Meeting of\r\nStates Parties regarding the implementation of\r\nConvention provisions. But we cannot support the\r\nchanges suggested in the rules of procedure of the\r\nMeeting of States Parties that envisage special\r\nprivileges for the great Powers in taking decisions on\r\nfinancial issues. This would amount to weighted\r\nvoting, which is contrary to the notion of the sovereign\r\nequality of States enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. At the same time, the idea of\r\nestablishing a financial committee of the Meeting of\r\nStates Parties and the respective changes in the\r\nfinancial rules require further careful study.\r\nWe consider the increase in the number of arrests\r\nof ships on unjustified grounds, merely to satisfy the\r\nactions of creditors, to be a negative development. We\r\ncondemn the arrest of crews with such vessels, which\r\nconstitutes a violation of the crews’ human rights. We\r\nwould welcome the preparation by the International\r\nTribunal of the Law of the Sea of a compendium of\r\njurisprudential practice, which would illustrate clearly\r\nthe limited grounds for the valid arrest of vessels in\r\nforeign ports.\r\nFinally, we regard the results of the work of\r\nanother institution established by the Convention —\r\nthe International Seabed Authority — as very positive.\r\nWe particularly welcome its adoption, at its sixth\r\nsession held this year in Kingston, of the deep seabed\r\nmining code.\r\nThis year, as in years past, Ukraine has the\r\nhonour to sponsor the draft resolution on oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea, so ably introduced by Victoria\r\nHallum, the representative of New Zealand. Paragraph\r\n1 of the draft resolution calls upon all States that have\r\nnot done so to become parties to the Convention and\r\nthe Agreement. In this regard, we welcome the\r\nstatement by the representative of the United States\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nthat his country continues to pursue ratification, with\r\nthe goal of becoming a party to the Convention and the\r\npart XI amending Agreement.\r\nIn conclusion, I welcome the provisions of the\r\ndraft resolution recognizing the expected increase in\r\nresponsibilities of the Division for Ocean Affairs and\r\nthe Law of the Sea in view of the progress in the work\r\nof the Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf and the anticipated receipt of submissions from\r\nStates. We believe that the Division, by virtue of the\r\nspecial responsibilities of the General Assembly,\r\ncontinues to play a pivotal role in this important\r\nprocess by monitoring all developments relating to the\r\nlaw of the sea and ocean affairs, as well as in servicing\r\nthe Commission. Once again, we commend the\r\nDivision for its excellent performance.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): As in\r\nprevious years, this year’s discussion on the oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea has been made easier by the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, which once again provides us\r\nwith a wealth of clear, well-organized information.\r\nAccordingly, we wish to thank the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea, which was charged\r\nwith preparing the report. We would only like to\r\nsuggest that the Division consider structuring future\r\nreports so as to give readers a comprehensive,\r\nintegrated overview of the current situation of marine\r\nareas and related developments, while continuing to\r\nprovide a detailed analysis of the various aspects of\r\nthis issue. We believe that in order to provide such a\r\ncomprehensive overview, this additional material\r\nshould include statistical data related to the main\r\nactivities that are taking place in our oceans — such as\r\nfishing and the exploitation of non-living resources.\r\nThe Division can easily obtain such data from other\r\nUnited Nations sources, and it would provide a\r\nstatistical complement to the focus on legal institutions\r\nthat predominates in the report. With this in mind, we\r\nthink that the calls contained in paragraphs 43 and 44\r\nof the draft resolution A/55/L.10 are very appropriate.\r\nThese paragraphs call on intergovernmental\r\norganizations, specialized bodies and other institutions\r\nto contribute to the preparation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s comprehensive report.\r\nThis time the General Assembly also has, in\r\naddition to the Secretary-General’s report, another\r\nreport from the first meeting of the Open-Ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on this issue. We would\r\nlike to thank and congratulate the Co-Chairpersons\r\nAmbassador Tuiloma Neroni Slade of Samoa and\r\nMr. Alan Simcock from the United Kingdom, for\r\nsuccessfully conducting these informal consultations.\r\nWe agree that the next round of consultations should\r\nfocus on marine science and technology and on piracy.\r\nWe believe that future consultations, along with being\r\nas productive as the first round, will offer experts from\r\nother countries the opportunity to contribute to the\r\nexamination of this issue.\r\nThe issue of the oceans and the law of the sea has\r\nso many, complex aspects, a simple reflection on the\r\ndocuments that have been submitted for our\r\nconsideration must be incomplete. Uruguay is\r\nparticularly concerned about two problems, to which I\r\nwill limit myself here today.\r\nThe first problem is the question of the\r\noverexploitation of the living resources of the sea. We\r\nsee this as one of the most serious problems we must\r\naddress. It demands urgent solutions. The extreme\r\nseriousness of this problem is not due to a lack of legal\r\nregulations, but rather to the fact that many of the\r\nexisting international instruments have been acceded to\r\nby only a relatively small number of countries, and\r\nbecause a number of these instruments have not entered\r\ninto force because they lack the requisite number of\r\nratifications.\r\nUruguay ratified the 1995 Agreement on\r\nstraddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,\r\nand also accepted the 1993 Agreement to Promote\r\nCompliance with International Conservation and\r\nManagement Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High\r\nSeas. However, neither of these two instruments has\r\nyet entered into force. We believe that a more vigorous\r\ncampaign to promote the ratification and acceptance of\r\nthe existing agreements should be initiated. And this\r\ncampaign should go far beyond the customary annual\r\npleas that we hear in this General Assembly.\r\nIn addition, the level of compliance with and\r\nimplementation of the norms of the legal regime\r\ngoverning ocean activities is unsatisfactory. This is the\r\ncase not only as regards fishing activities but also,\r\nunfortunately, in other areas of the law of the sea. It is\r\nour belief that in the future we must concentrate on\r\nreviewing the effectiveness of existing norms, while\r\nlooking at new ways to urge and encourage States to\r\nfulfil and comply with these norms.\r\nThe second problem I would like to discuss is the\r\nprotection and preservation of the marine environment.\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nObviously this is an issue that must continue to be a\r\npriority item on our agendas. Without prejudice to all\r\nthe other aspects of this problem deserving of the\r\nAssembly’s attention, we would like to highlight the\r\nimportance of intensifying international cooperation\r\nwith respect to one of the major land-based sources of\r\npollution of the seas: wastewater. Wastewater not only\r\naffects the marine environment but also land-based\r\necosystems and human health.\r\nIn this regard, we note with satisfaction a positive\r\nresponse that should be imitated. I am referring to the\r\nrecent adoption by the Caribbean countries of a\r\nprotocol on pollution from land-based sources and\r\nactivities. This was a protocol to the Convention for\r\nthe Protection and Development of Marine\r\nEnvironment of the Wider Caribbean Region.\r\nWe also take note of the fact that the United\r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) is looking at\r\nthis issue, and that the information-exchange unit that\r\nwas set up in accordance with the Global Programme\r\nof Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment\r\nfrom Land-Based Activities is developing a\r\nmethodology for taking steps regarding this kind of\r\npollution. Over the long term, however, I believe it will\r\nbe essential, in the near future, to hold a new world\r\nconference to address this problem.\r\nAs part of this discussion, I must bring up the\r\nissue of the marine transport of radioactive materials or\r\nwastes. With alarming regularity, boats transporting\r\nlarge quantities of radioactive material are using\r\nshipping lanes that pass along our coasts. When this\r\nhas occurred and in response to protests from our\r\nauthorities, the Governments whose flags are being\r\nflown by the ships in question have assured us that the\r\ntransport is being carried out in line with all the\r\nexisting safety standards. But we know that it will\r\nnever be possible to exclude absolutely the possibility\r\nof an accident, and if an accident were to occur, it\r\nwould have disastrous consequences for the maritime\r\nzones under our sovereignty and for our territory.\r\nThere is absolutely no reason for us to continue\r\nexposing our territories and our marine areas — and\r\nthose of other countries — to such risks. It is our belief\r\nthat we should adopt stricter regulations to ensure that\r\nthe transport of such dangerous cargo use shipping\r\nlanes and meet standards that guarantee absolutely that\r\ncoastal States will not suffer any damage in the case of\r\nan accident.\r\nI cannot conclude without mentioning the\r\nsuccessful completion of the negotiations carried out at\r\nthe meeting of the International Seabed Authority with\r\na view to formulating regulations on prospecting and\r\nexploration for polymetallic nodules in the Area. We\r\nknow very well how complex this issue is, given the\r\nlegal and technical problems associated with marine\r\nmining at great depths.\r\nMr. Shihab (Maldives), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe adoption of a genuine code to govern these\r\nactivities is an achievement that should be welcomed\r\nand marks the beginning of a new stage in the activities\r\nof the International Seabed Authority, in which the\r\nworking plans of the first seven investors can be put\r\ninto effect.\r\nWe also wish to highlight the valuable\r\ncontribution of the International Tribunal for the Law\r\nof the Sea to the consolidation of the rule of law in the\r\ninternational community and the work of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nOur country, whose continental shelf extends more than\r\n200 miles from our coast, looks forward to receiving\r\nvaluable assistance from the Commission.\r\nMr. Hili (Malta): This delegation associates itself\r\nwith the statement made yesterday by the delegation of\r\nFrance on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThis year’s discussion on oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea once again assumes significant importance in\r\nthe work of the General Assembly. In view of its\r\ninitiative on the concept of the common heritage of\r\nmankind, as applied to the seabed, Malta has been\r\nfollowing this item with particular interest that has not\r\nsubsided since 1967, when the late Dr. Arvid Pardo, the\r\nfirst Permanent Representative of Malta to the United\r\nNations, launched the concept that eventually led to the\r\nadoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea. Today, I take this opportunity to pay tribute\r\nto Ambassador Pardo for his remarkable legacy.\r\nMay I also thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report on agenda item 34, which\r\nhighlights some of the challenges the international\r\ncommunity is facing in ocean affairs.\r\nMy delegation strongly believes that the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides the\r\noverall legal framework within which all activities in\r\nthis field must be considered. Problems of ocean space\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nare closely interrelated and as such need to be\r\nconsidered as a whole. The strategic importance of the\r\nConvention as a framework for national, regional and\r\nglobal action in the marine sector cannot be sufficiently\r\nunderlined.\r\nThe General Assembly, during its fifty-fourth\r\nsession, highlighted the need for international\r\ncoordination and cooperation in ocean affairs.\r\nFurthermore, it also noted that oceans and seas present\r\na special case for international coordination. The\r\nGeneral Assembly therefore recommended that a more\r\nintegrated approach be taken in addressing all legal,\r\neconomic, social and environmental aspects of the\r\noceans and seas.\r\nVery much aware of this need, my delegation was\r\nat the forefront in promoting the establishment of an\r\ninformal consultative process to facilitate the annual\r\nreview by the General Assembly of developments in\r\nocean affairs and to identify areas for enhanced\r\nintergovernmental coordination and cooperation. In this\r\nregard, we welcome the outcome of the first meeting of\r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, which\r\nproved to be very useful to the deliberations of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on this agenda item.\r\nThis holistic approach gains enhanced relevance\r\nwhen we consider that the rate of change in the\r\ndevelopment of marine activities is presenting the\r\ninternational community with new challenges in the\r\nsocial, economic and environmental sectors. My\r\ndelegation firmly believes that marine science, with all\r\nits related aspects, especially capacity-building, is\r\nfundamental to the implementation of the Convention.\r\nIn this respect, we note with satisfaction the\r\nrecommendation of the Assembly to the second\r\nmeeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Ocean Affairs and the Law of\r\nthe Sea that it focus its attention on this theme, as well\r\nas on the issue of piracy at sea.\r\nOne other significant issue highlighted by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report is the traffic in narcotic\r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances. Traffickers\r\nincreasingly turn to sea transportation as a method of\r\ndrug smuggling. My delegation believes that this issue\r\nmust be addressed by the international community with\r\nurgency. It is a problem that cannot be solved through\r\nthe individual actions of single countries, but calls for a\r\ncoordinated and collective campaign aimed against\r\nsuch illegal practices. In this respect, we commend the\r\nwork conducted by the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme.\r\nThe smuggling of migrants is another matter of\r\nconcern. It is the smugglers who commit such criminal\r\nactions who should be punished and not the victims,\r\nwho are very often economically and physically\r\nvictimized. Unfortunately, the Mediterranean region is\r\nincreasingly experiencing such illegal practices. This\r\nsituation calls for collective action by the international\r\ncommunity to address this inhumane trade in desperate\r\npersons. The international community must address, in\r\na comprehensive manner, such factors as poverty and\r\nunemployment that are the root causes of this problem.\r\nMy delegation believes that an integrated\r\napproach to coastal zone management, and in particular\r\nto land-based sources of pollution, is fundamental to\r\nsustainable development. In this context, we reaffirm\r\nour commitment to the implementation of the Global\r\nProgramme of Action on Land-based Sources of\r\nMarine Pollution. Towards this end, the Government of\r\nMalta hosted the eleventh ordinary meeting of the\r\nContracting parties to the 1976 Barcelona Convention\r\non the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea.\r\nFurthermore, as a concrete step towards the\r\nimplementation of the objectives set out in chapter 17\r\nof Agenda 21, the Government of Malta has also\r\nratified all but one of the Protocols to the Barcelona\r\nConvention.\r\nThe management of marine living resources is\r\nanother priority of my delegation. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the steps taken by the General Fisheries\r\nCommission for the Mediterranean Sea to strengthen\r\nits role in fisheries management, and in particular the\r\nban on the use of drift-net fishing in the Mediterranean\r\nSea. We acknowledge that issues relating to illegal,\r\nunregulated and unreported fishing, as well as marine\r\ndebris, call for urgent action. The efforts of the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to\r\ndevelop an international plan of action to deter illegal,\r\nunregulated and unreported fishing are highly\r\ncommendable.\r\nFinally, my delegation, in noting with satisfaction\r\nthe adoption of the mining code by the International\r\nSeabed Authority, welcomes this new development\r\nwhich allows the Authority, to proceed to issuing\r\ncontracts to pioneer investors.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nOceans need to be managed in a sustainable\r\nmanner for the well-being of both present and future\r\ngenerations. My country is perfectly aware of this,\r\nsince Malta’s history, dating back more than 7,000\r\nyears, has always been entwined with that of its\r\nsurrounding sea. My delegation pledges its continued\r\ncommitment to the achievement of this goal.\r\nMr. Gomaa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to extend my thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report\r\nprepared under agenda item 34 of the General\r\nAssembly, regarding “Oceans and the law of the sea.”\r\nIn this connection, we would like to underline the\r\nimportant role undertaken by the Secretary-General\r\nconcerning the item under discussion. In particular we\r\nwould like to highlight his responsibilities emanating\r\nfrom the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea (UNCLOS) concerning the management of ocean\r\naffairs and the law of the sea, as well as the preparation\r\nof annual reports and special reports.\r\nThe year covered by the report refers to important\r\ndevelopments concerning the participation in and\r\naccession to the legal system established by the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\r\nThis Convention is veritably considered one of the\r\nmost important conventions concluded in modern\r\ntimes. The entry into effect of this Convention in 1994\r\nhad a great effect in supporting the legal system\r\nestablished by the Convention, which had been in\r\npractice even before the opening for signature of the\r\nConvention in 1982.\r\nThe best proof can be seen in the increased\r\nattention paid by the international community to the\r\nConvention and in the increasing number of countries\r\nacceding to it. The number of members that have\r\nacceded to the Convention has so far reached more\r\nthan 130. In this connection, we would like to\r\nencourage the rest of the international community to\r\naccede to the Convention.\r\nWe would also like to urge the States parties to\r\nthe Convention to submit the necessary declarations in\r\naccordance with Articles 287 and 288 concerning the\r\nsettlement of disputes, because the number of States\r\nthat have submitted declarations in this respect is still\r\nlimited.\r\nWe have already established three institutions\r\nunder the Convention: the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf and the International Tribunal for the\r\nLaw of the Sea. Thus, these institutions have\r\neffectively moved from the stage of creation to the\r\nstage of operation. The results of their work have\r\nbecome clear to all.\r\nEgypt has actively participated in the efforts\r\nleading to the establishment of these institutions. We\r\nthus call upon the international community to proceed\r\nto the implementation of the legal system established\r\nby UNCLOS by applying the provisions of the\r\nConvention at the national level. In this connection, I\r\nwould like to welcome the observation of the\r\nSecretary-General in his report that there is an\r\nincreasing trend on the part of the States to adopt\r\nnational strategies with regard to the oceans on the\r\nbasis of the principle of integrated management. We\r\nsee that this will help States to adopt relevant decision-\r\nmaking mechanisms at the national level. Here, we\r\nwould like to confirm that there is a need to pay more\r\nattention to the ocean resources. In particular, we\r\nbelieve that the preservation and protection of marine\r\nenvironments is the responsibility of the whole\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe have taken note of the activities of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea over the\r\npast year. We encourage disputing parties to resort to\r\nthe Tribunal to settle their differences. We would like\r\nto pay tribute to the significant effort made by the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority to enact the Mining\r\nCode, which is important in establishing the basis for\r\nexploring the seabed of the Area in a manner that\r\npreserves common rights to natural resources. At the\r\nsame time, we would like to support the efforts of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf\r\nwith regard to the question of training and the\r\nestablishment of a trust fund to help in financing the\r\nparticipation of the members of the Commission from\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThis year the Informal Consultative Process held\r\nits first meeting. Even though the General Assembly\r\nwill evaluate the work of this Process during its fifty-\r\nseventh session in accordance with its resolution 54/33,\r\nwe would like to make two general observations\r\nconcerning the benefits that could be gained from this\r\nprocess. We have noticed that the majority of\r\ndeveloping countries have not been able to send\r\nexperts to attend the meetings, owing either to lack of\r\nresources or to lack of experience. This is a question\r\nthat has its effect on the effectiveness of the process.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nOn the other hand, the priorities of developed countries\r\nfeatured high on the agenda of the Process, and this\r\nadversely affected the benefits that developing\r\ncountries could gain from this Process.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report tells us that\r\nmarine safety constitutes a challenge to the majority of\r\ncountries, particularly developing countries and that\r\nthere is an increase in crime affecting marine shipping,\r\nincluding trafficking in drugs, goods and stowaways, as\r\nwell as an increase in piracy. This requires our\r\nvigilance and attention. In this regard, we would like to\r\npay tribute to the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nestablished in accordance with Economic and Social\r\nCouncil resolution 1998/14 of 1998, which was\r\nentrusted with the preparation of a general agreement\r\nto combat transnational crime. We expect that such a\r\nconvention will contribute to combating this kind of\r\ncrime and to eliminating it completely.\r\nThe preservation and monitoring of the marine\r\nenvironment, economically and environmentally, are\r\nbasic objectives of UNCLOS. This is an integral part of\r\nthe implementation of the Convention. Regrettably,\r\nhowever, present studies indicate that despite an\r\nincrease in fishery products, future demand for fish\r\ncannot be met. This is due to the lack of good\r\nmanagement of sea and ocean resources. We noticed\r\nthat the present legal system has not been able to\r\nprotect fish resources against over-exploitation. This is\r\ndue to over-fishing of living maritime resources and to\r\nlack of political will by some States to respect certain\r\nrules concerning fisheries, rules pertaining to\r\nquantitative limits as well as to means of fishing — for\r\nexample, the resort by some countries to drift-net\r\nfishing, which causes harm to fish resources and to the\r\nmarine environment. We call upon those States to\r\nrespect the Agreement on fish stocks of 1995, as well\r\nas the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. We\r\ncall upon them to enact special rules concerning the\r\nsale of sea products in a responsible manner\r\ncomplementing both the Code and the Agreement.\r\nAs for the deterioration of the marine\r\nenvironment, the report of the Group of Experts on the\r\nScientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection\r\n(GESAMP) indicates that there have been efforts at the\r\nnational level and some successes at the regional level,\r\nparticularly those aimed at decreasing the discharge of\r\noil by ships. However, the situation in the oceans is\r\ndeteriorating owing to the dumping of radioactive\r\nmaterials, hazardous materials, poisonous materials,\r\nsewage materials and oil. We therefore confirm that it\r\nis necessary to enhance international cooperation in\r\norder to avoid pollution of the environment.\r\nWe call for the enforcement of internationally\r\nrecognized criteria for protecting the marine\r\nenvironment. We refer here to the report on\r\nenvironment prospects for 2000 issued by the United\r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) in\r\nSeptember 1999, which indicates that the coastal\r\nmarine environment is affected concretely by natural\r\nchanges, destruction, over-fishing and pollution. The\r\nreport indicates that the ocean bed is no longer immune\r\nfrom pollution. In particular there is evidence of\r\nenvironmental deterioration in some areas, particularly\r\na decline in some marine species.\r\nHere we confirm the importance of abiding by\r\narticle 235 of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, concerning international cooperation\r\non matters of accountability, responsibility, the\r\nassessment of and compensation for damages and the\r\nsettlement of disputes. In this regard, Egypt has\r\nadopted important measures to protect and preserve the\r\nmarine environment, such as enacting rules and special\r\nlaws on the environment and declaring some marine\r\nareas as natural reserves.\r\nEgypt has given the question of underwater\r\ncultural heritage special attention, and we support the\r\nefforts of the United Nations Educational and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) to prepare an international\r\nagreement on the subject as soon as possible in order to\r\nprotect this heritage. However, we have to take into\r\nconsideration the rights of coastal States, particularly\r\ntheir jurisdiction over the underwater cultural heritage\r\nin the exclusive economic zones or in the continental\r\nshelf, in line with the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea. We hope that the Director-General\r\nof UNESCO will be able to submit a draft on the\r\nmatter to the General Conference of UNESCO,\r\nparticularly in light of technological development,\r\nwhich has helped in exploring for, lifting and salvaging\r\nhistoric debris even from very deep waters.\r\nMr. Manele (Solomon Islands): Solomon Islands\r\nfully aligns itself with the statement made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Tonga, on behalf of the\r\ncountries of the Pacific Islands Forum. We also endorse\r\nthe statement by the delegation of Samoa on behalf of\r\nthe Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nThe indispensability of the oceans and seas to the\r\neconomic development and sustenance of our\r\ncountries, especially the small island developing States\r\nin our region, cannot be underestimated. For Solomon\r\nIslands the fisheries sector, in particular the tuna\r\nindustry, accounts for 25 per cent of our foreign\r\nexchange earnings. It is the single largest employer.\r\nCoastal fisheries on the other hand, while mainly\r\nproviding subsistence fishing, are critical to the well-\r\nbeing of our rural population. Solomon Islands is\r\namong the countries with the highest per capita\r\nconsumption of fish in the world. It is therefore no\r\nsurprise that my delegation attaches great importance\r\nto oceans and seas issues and continues to be a sponsor\r\nof draft resolutions on this item.\r\nThe problems of over exploitation of living\r\nmarine resources, excess fishing capacity, by-catch and\r\ndiscards, and illegal, unregulated and unreported\r\nfishing remain major concerns for my country. The\r\nprevalence of illegal, unregulated, and unreported\r\nfishing seriously undermines the economic base, food\r\nsecurity and, above all, the human security of coastal\r\nStates like Solomon Islands. The international\r\ncommunity, especially the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), must\r\nredouble its efforts to address this problem. Similar\r\nefforts are required to implement internationally agreed\r\nplans of action to confront marine pollution and the\r\nimpact of climate change and changing weather\r\npatterns, such as El Niño on the marine ecosystem. The\r\ndamaging effects of the El Niño phenomena, including\r\ncoral bleaching, are particularly alarming. Coral\r\nbleaching directly threatens the survival of both the\r\ncoastal marine ecosystem and the communities that\r\ndepend on reef services.\r\nRecognizing the need to promote sustainable\r\nexploitation of our fisheries resources and the proper\r\nmanagement of the marine environment, Solomon\r\nIslands has revised its laws relating to fisheries, and\r\nenacted a Fisheries Act in 1998. This Act is consistent\r\nwith the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea (UNCLOS) and the United Nations fish stocks\r\nAgreement, both of which we have ratified.\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Act, and\r\nwith technical assistance from the Forum Fisheries\r\nAgency, we have developed a tuna fishery management\r\nand development plan. The plan, one of the first of its\r\nkind in our region, provides clear policy guidelines and\r\na transparent decision-making process for tuna\r\nfisheries. It also offers a framework for the sustainable\r\nuse of our tuna resources, while maximizing the\r\neconomic and social benefits to our people.\r\nIn addition, the Act includes provisions for the\r\ninstallation of the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS),\r\nwhich enables our authorities to monitor the position of\r\nall distant water fishing Nation vessels fishing in our\r\nexclusive economic zone. Installation of the VMS is\r\nnot a licence to fish. It is a cost-effective and efficient\r\nmeans of controlling fishing activities, and Solomon\r\nIslands views its use as a relatively minor imposition\r\non distant water fishing nation operators. Provided\r\nfishing vessels are doing the right thing, there should\r\nbe no difficulty with this requirement. To date, several\r\nvessels have been fitted with the VMS. Solomon\r\nIslands appreciates the cooperation of a number of\r\ndistant water fishing nations in this exercise and calls\r\non others to follow suit. We further encourage other\r\ncountries in our region to legalize the use of the VMS.\r\nIn collaboration with The Nature Conservancy,\r\nSolomon Islands, through our Ministry of Environment\r\nand a community group, has established a marine\r\nreserve project called the Arnavon Islands Marine\r\nReserve. The Arnavon Islands is one of the most\r\nimportant rookeries in the western Pacific for the\r\nendangered hawksbill turtle. The area’s marine\r\nenvironment also supports commercially valuable\r\nspecies, including fish, oysters, beche-demer and giant\r\nclams. The project is community-based, involving three\r\nvillages in the area. It consists of a management plan\r\nthat provides viable alternative marine enterprises. This\r\nis the country’s first cooperatively managed marine\r\nconservation area. If successful, it will demonstrate the\r\neconomic and ecological benefits of a community-\r\nbased approach to development and resource\r\nconservation.\r\nAt the regional level, Solomon Islands was\r\nactively involved in the Multilateral high-level\r\nConference and negotiations leading to the adoption,\r\non 4 September this year, of the Convention on the\r\nConservation and Management of Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean,\r\nwhich was concluded pursuant to the principles\r\noutlined in the United Nations fish stocks Agreement.\r\nSolomon Islands wishes to acknowledge the able\r\nChairmanship of Ambassador Satya Nandan in\r\nconcluding the negotiations. We look forward to a\r\nconcerted regional effort to implement the Convention,\r\nas well as to its increasing international acceptance.\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nSolomon Islands also welcomes the establishment\r\nof the United Nations Open-ended Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea, which held its first consultations here in New York\r\nlast May. We are of the view that the United Nations\r\nremains the appropriate body to host and facilitate such\r\nan attempt to achieve an integrated approach on oceans\r\nand law of the sea matters. The continued participation\r\nof experts from small islands developing States at\r\nfuture consultations is important.\r\nThe issue of the establishment of the outer limits\r\nof a State’s continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles\r\nwithin the 10-year period of entry into force of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for\r\nState parties is a pressing issue for Solomon Islands,\r\nwhich ratified the Convention in 1997. The practical\r\nand technical obstacles that developing countries, in\r\nparticular small islands developing States and the least\r\ndeveloped countries, face in such a mammoth task are\r\nvery obvious. As highlighted during the Tenth Meeting\r\nof the States Parties, the support and cooperation of the\r\ninternational community are vital. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation welcomes Norway’s announcement of its\r\ninitial contribution to the proposed voluntary trust fund\r\nfor the above activity.\r\nFinally, like others who spoke earlier, Solomon\r\nIslands welcomes the adoption of the Regulations on\r\nProspecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules\r\nin the Area, the mining code, by the International\r\nSeabed Authority at its resumed sixth session. This\r\ninstrument enables the Authority to proceed to issue\r\ncontracts to the registered pioneer investors whose\r\nwork plans were approved by the Council of the\r\nAuthority in 1997. Solomon Islands also notes with\r\nkeen interest the continued work of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\ntowards a draft convention for the protection of the\r\nunderwater cultural heritage. We hope that the ongoing\r\nnegotiations on this draft convention are in conformity\r\nwith the relevant provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea to ensure wider and\r\nstronger international support when it is adopted and\r\nimplemented.\r\nMr. Leslie (Belize): This delegation wishes to\r\nexpress its gratitude to the Permanent Representative\r\nof Jamaica for her statement on behalf of the members\r\nof the Caribbean Community. We concur with that\r\nstatement. My delegation also wishes to be associated\r\nwith the statement to be issued by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Samoa on behalf of the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States.\r\nOne year has passed since we last debated the\r\nmatters being discussed today. Since then we have\r\ntaken what might, in due course, be seen as a quantum\r\nleap. Two eminent islanders have presided over that\r\nleap, Ambassador Tuiloma Neroni Slade of Samoa and\r\nMr. Alan Simcock of the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland. We thank these sons of\r\ntwo sets of islands. A third islander whom I take\r\npleasure in complimenting is Mr. Donigi of Papua New\r\nGuinea. As President of the Tenth Meeting of States\r\nParties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea, Mr. Donigi has also been ably presiding over a\r\nprocess that is seeing considerable development and\r\nmaturation.\r\nAn aspect of that process is the significant strides\r\nbeing made by the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf and the International Seabed\r\nAuthority. Their labours give much cause for\r\nsatisfaction. This is well complemented by the rich\r\nproductions of the International Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea, which in a short time has developed\r\nsubstantial jurisprudence.\r\nThe quantum leap has been the first meeting of\r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, which has\r\ngiven us the somewhat promising new acronym,\r\nUNICPOLOS. In a single bold step, the Consultative\r\nProcess has reformed the dynamic of this vitally\r\nimportant annual debate. At the same time, it is clear\r\nthat now there will be greater and wholesome\r\nconcentration of our minds and our energies on the vast\r\narray of matters concerning the oceans and law of the\r\nsea. My delegation is convinced that we will now have\r\nmuch better focus and sharper vision.\r\nSo convinced is the delegation of Belize of the\r\nimportance of the Informal Consultative Process that\r\nthese remarks are largely limited to the two main issues\r\non which the Process focused. This may well become\r\nsomewhat of a trend in the annual debate, since\r\nnormally the possible subjects for discussion are so\r\nnumerous as to be potentially unmanageable.\r\nFirst, I must say how impressed my delegation\r\nhas been by the UNICPOLOS discussion of responsible\r\nfisheries and the phenomenon of illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing — IUU fishing. The report of\r\nthe Informal Consultation Process provides a wealth of\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nvital information about these matters. Before\r\ndiscussing a few aspects of it, let me state that my\r\ndelegation still prefers to describe this phenomenon as\r\n“fishing” and not “fisheries”, which has certain\r\nconnotations that do not seem to be apparent in the\r\nphenomenon under discussion.\r\nThe report briefly outlines the discussion of the\r\nuseful experience of other States. In that connection,\r\nwe were impressed by such local practices as Iceland’s\r\nCommittee on Good Treatment of Living Marine\r\nResources. Perhaps such committees of stakeholders\r\nand other participants, including fishing fleets and\r\nmaritime administrations, could be established on a\r\nregional or subregional basis — for example, in the\r\narea of the Association of Caribbean States, of which\r\nBelize is a member.\r\nThe UNICPOLOS report also contains\r\nsuggestions for a number of paths that can be followed\r\nby countries such as mine and its neighbours. These\r\ninclude common or joint systems of information,\r\nmonitoring, surveillance and enforcement within and\r\nbetween various communities and jurisdictions.\r\nI must also commend the utility of another report\r\nof the Secretary-General — his report on large-scale\r\npelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing, fisheries\r\nby-catch and discards, and other matters. That report is\r\na useful compendium of national, subregional and\r\nregional practices and developments. This year its\r\nsurvey of legislation, policy instruments and actions is\r\nan excellent counterpart to the UNICPOLOS\r\ndocuments.\r\nThese processes have led my authorities to\r\nconsider more closely the possible ratification of the\r\nfish stocks Agreement, of which it is a signatory. It is\r\nseeking advice on this matter, as well as on the related\r\nquestion of the possibility of adherence to the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\nAgreement to Promote Compliance with International\r\nConservation and Management Measures by Fishing\r\nVessels on the High Seas.\r\nIn this connection, the delegation of Belize\r\nwishes to note its views that the ongoing discussion on\r\nthe responsibilities of the flag State is a matter in\r\nwhich some material particulars differ from what has\r\nbeen called “providing a definition of the genuine link\r\nunder article 91 of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea”. Apart from the fact that article 91\r\nrefers to a genuine link, and not to a sole and all-\r\nencompassing concept, flag State responsibilities\r\narguably could encompass elements that might\r\ncomprise less, or even more, than a genuine link, which\r\ncould ultimately not be seen as a central issue.\r\nAnother key issue that was closely examined by\r\nUNICPOLOS was the economic and social impact of\r\nmarine pollution and degradation. There is much\r\nignorance or lack of caring about these matters in\r\ndeveloping countries and even in developed countries.\r\nI am uncertain about the degree of sensitization of\r\nmany populaces or even industries about the impact of\r\nland use and riverine use on drinking water and coastal\r\nmarine resources. Recently these matters were brought\r\nhome in a rather dramatic fashion in Belize’s central\r\nsouthern coastal and riverine areas.\r\nFurthermore, in countries such as mine we are at\r\nthe dawn of realization of the existence of the debate\r\nabout the possible impact of vessel source pollution on\r\nthe marine environment. That realization is dawning\r\njust as we are beginning to see a substantial increase in\r\nvisits by cruise vessels.\r\nA similar issue is the potential negative impact on\r\nthe marine environment of some forms of mariculture.\r\nIt is clear that in our various subregions there is a\r\nneed for the establishment of a popular sensitization\r\nprocess, for the creation of a clearinghouse mechanism\r\nand for the expansion and improvement of information\r\nsystems. This leads me to recall that, as always, we\r\ncannot fail to advert to the massive need for capacity-\r\nbuilding and for obtaining training and technical and\r\nfinancial assistance to develop necessary expertise and\r\ninfrastructures. In that connection, the delegation of\r\nBelize sincerely commends the initiative of the United\r\nKingdom for proposing and the Meeting of States\r\nParties to the Convention for recommending a broad-\r\nbased and multifaceted trust fund for developing\r\ncountries that are litigants before the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. The matter is before\r\nthe General Assembly today.\r\nWe also commend other matters before the\r\nAssembly today: the proposed trust fund initiatives\r\nrelated to participation in meetings of UNICPOLOS\r\nand of the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf and for States to meet their\r\nobligations under article 76 of the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea. We would also urge the exploration of\r\nmodalities to ensure enhanced participation at the\r\nmeetings of the International Seabed Authority.\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nMr. Cappagli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nwas adopted in this very building on 30 April 1982.\r\nThe Convention was opened for signature at the end of\r\nthat year, and entered into force in the next decade.\r\nThe seas and oceans cover most of the earth’s\r\nsurface and — among many other things — provide 80\r\nper cent of the planet’s oxygen and are a vital source of\r\nfood and resources. The universal legal regime\r\ngoverning them is therefore a fundamental\r\nconstitutional pillar, which is the result of many years\r\nof dedicated work, robust negotiations and delicate\r\ncompromises. Consequently, full respect for the\r\nConvention should guide all activities related to the\r\nseas and oceans.\r\nArgentina has signed and ratified the Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea and reiterates its firm\r\ncommitment to that instrument, which is of ever-\r\nincreasing importance. We therefore believe that its\r\nimplementation by States and international\r\norganizations should be strictly guided by its norms.\r\nThe General Assembly considers the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on this matter annually. This year\r\nwe have also benefited from the first meeting of the\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law\r\nof the Sea, which is an interesting and innovative\r\nmechanism. Our country took part in the preparations\r\nfor the first meeting of this experimental mechanism,\r\nand hopes to be able to continue to contribute to\r\nperfecting it. We believe that this Process should\r\nguarantee the full participation of experts from every\r\nState, and in particular those of developing countries.\r\nWe also believe that both the issues under\r\nconsideration and their results should reflect a\r\nconsensus that takes into account all points of view.\r\nWe congratulate the International Seabed\r\nAuthority and its member States on the adoption of the\r\nRegulations on Prospecting and Exploration for\r\nPolymetallic Nodules in the Area, a mining code whose\r\nadoption makes it possible to begin issuing contracts to\r\nthe registered pioneer investors. We would like to point\r\nout that those investors will be subject to the provisions\r\nof the Convention, the Agreement on Part XI and\r\nfuture norms and regulations established by the\r\nAuthority in conformity with the Convention and the\r\nAgreement. Those provisions will include rules for\r\npreserving the environment necessary to guarantee the\r\nappropriate development of those activities.\r\nArgentina likewise supports the negotiating\r\nprocess being undertaken within the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on a\r\nconvention on the underwater cultural heritage. We\r\nbelieve that that process should be concluded within\r\nthe framework of that body, with respect for\r\ninternational law, as codified in the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nMy country would also like to refer to the\r\nmaritime transport of radioactive wastes and mixed\r\noxide fuel. We share the concern about their\r\ntransportation because of the intrinsic danger posed by\r\nsuch cargoes to the health of the inhabitants, the\r\nenvironment and the marine ecosystems of our region.\r\nAlthough these cargoes seem to be in line with\r\ninternational standards on the transport of radioactive\r\nmaterials, and even bearing in mind that Argentina has\r\nnever questioned the principle of freedom of\r\nnavigation, we must point out — given the very serious\r\nconsequences of an accident involving such\r\nmaterials — that this is an extraordinarily delicate type\r\nof shipment. It will therefore be necessary to increase\r\nthe contacts between the Governments involved in\r\norder to take all appropriate precautionary measures.\r\nOnce again this year we have seen how the law of\r\nthe sea and ocean issues have captured the interest of\r\nthe General Assembly. We are pleased to see such\r\nimportant issues receive the attention they so richly\r\ndeserve. They are not only at the top of the agendas of\r\nmany countries; they are also vital to the international\r\ncommunity. Argentina will continue to support their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn closing, we would like to express our deep\r\nappreciation for the efforts made by the coordinators of\r\nthe two draft resolutions — Ms. Alison Drayton of\r\nGuyana and Ms. Victoria Hallum of New Zealand — as\r\nwell as by Mr. Colin Mciff of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nMr. Slade (Samoa): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the 37 member countries of the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States that are Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nFirst, may I thank all concerned for the quality of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s annual report on the oceans\r\nand law of the sea. We appreciate in particular the\r\ndetailed nature and comprehensiveness of the report\r\nand the efforts to make it as current as possible. It\r\nseems to us, though, that the annual report could well\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nbenefit from a more analytical approach to some of the\r\nissues, perhaps with an assessment of how some of the\r\npersistent problems could more effectively be\r\naddressed. The discussions at the United Nations Open-\r\nended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the issues and viewpoints\r\nexpressed could no doubt be useful in that respect. We\r\nlook forward to the possibility of such an approach in\r\nthe year ahead.\r\nThe ocean exerts vital influence on all islands.\r\nWe are ocean-dwellers; it is our natural environment.\r\nWe take seriously the fact that our communities are\r\nacknowledged custodians of large areas of the world’s\r\noceans and seas. Islands have a high share of global\r\nbiodiversity, which is now increasingly under pressure,\r\nand our countries are at the forefront of the struggle\r\nagainst climate change. These factors point to a\r\ncomplicated web of local and global issues, and to the\r\nobvious need to take an integrated approach in dealing\r\nwith them. They explain why island States are\r\nconcerned, in the context of sustainable development,\r\nto promote such an approach in the conservation and\r\nmanagement of special areas such as the Caribbean\r\nSea. They are also the same factors that underline the\r\nexposure and predicament of island communities, and\r\nthe urgent need for the international community as a\r\nwhole to help with more specific measures for the\r\neffective implementation of the Barbados Programme\r\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea is now nearly universal in its acceptance and\r\nrecognition by the international community. It sets the\r\nlegal order and provides the framework within which\r\nall activities relating to the oceans and to the seas must\r\nbe considered and carried out. The Convention is both\r\ncomprehensive and integrated, and for the foreseeable\r\nfuture we would expect that it will continue to provide\r\na sound and balanced basis for national, regional and\r\nglobal efforts. For the Convention to be fully effective,\r\nhowever, we would need to ensure that it is\r\nimplemented uniformly and in a manner that preserves\r\nits integrity and character.\r\nWith States and organizations now striving to\r\nimplement the Convention and to use it as a framework\r\nfor a variety of economic, scientific and technical\r\nactivities, it is essential that there be the fullest\r\ncoordination and integration at all levels. The\r\nagreements and the declared objectives of Agenda 21,\r\nits chapter 17 in particular, provide the essential\r\nnecessary tools for implementation. As the Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs,\r\nMr. Nitin Desai, remarked at the opening of the Open-\r\nended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and\r\nthe Law of the Sea, there needs to be a connection\r\nbetween the legal dimension of rights and obligations\r\nset under the Convention and the substantive\r\nprogrammatic dimension with regard to sustainable\r\ndevelopment provided for in Agenda 21.\r\nSome of these issues were addressed by the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development at its\r\nimportant seventh session, out of which we had the\r\nrecommendation, accepted by the General Assembly,\r\nfor a more integrated approach to all legal, economic,\r\nsocial and environmental aspects of oceans and seas,\r\nboth at the intergovernmental level and at the inter-\r\nagency level. Let me say that our own group agrees\r\nthat we need to provide for adequate oversight and\r\ncoordination of the myriad activities relating to the\r\noceans and seas. Without proper coordination and an\r\nintegrated approach, there is risk of fragmentation and\r\npossibly contradictory activities and results.\r\nThe AOSIS countries welcomed the inauguration\r\nof the Informal Consultative Process earlier in the year.\r\nWe see it as a necessary and positive step forward in\r\naddressing in some detail some of the current and\r\nemerging issues of concern. AOSIS reiterates its full\r\nsupport for the Consultative Process. We take the\r\nopportunity to offer our congratulations and warmest\r\nappreciation to all the many persons concerned with\r\nthe preparations and the holding of this new, important\r\nseries of consultations, to my Co-chairperson, Mr. Alan\r\nSimcock, and to other colleagues at the division for\r\nOcean Affairs and Law of the Sea in particular, as well\r\nas to Second-Committee colleagues led by New\r\nZealand, Guyana and the United States, who\r\ncoordinated the draft resolutions now before the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe thought that the choice of illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing as one of the two major themes\r\nfor the Informal Consultative Process was appropriate.\r\nOverexploitation of marine resources and the\r\nconsequent degradation of the marine environment are\r\nobviously matters of serious concern for all countries.\r\nThat they continue to occur, in some cases with\r\nalarming severity of consequences, represents, in a\r\nsense, the inability of States to properly implement\r\nagreed and desired tasks and goals. Tackling the\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nproblem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\r\nis directly linked to the sustainable future of coastal\r\nisland countries such as ours, to food security and to\r\nthe general improvement of our economies. This\r\nremains an urgent matter, and we readily join the call\r\nin draft resolution A/55/L.10, urging States to do their\r\nutmost through efforts begun within the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\r\nto agree on a comprehensive international plan of\r\naction on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report (A/54/2000) to the\r\nMillennium Assembly identified marine and coastal\r\nareas as among the most essential to human life, and\r\nalso as the most threatened by pollution. Healthy\r\nmarine and coastal systems would be the absolute\r\nprerequisite for the sustainability of island States. We\r\nplace the highest priority on this issue, and we\r\nappreciated the opportunity made available during the\r\nInformal Consultative Process to have the problem of\r\npollution from land-based sources discussed. It is the\r\nview of our group that much more is required of the\r\ninternational community to address the problem and to\r\nproperly implement the Global Programme of Action\r\nfor the Protection of the Marine Environment from\r\nLand-based Activities. The AOSIS countries will\r\nfollow with attention and with interest efforts now\r\nbeing made for the first intergovernmental review of\r\nthe Global Programme of Action.\r\nOne of the most important features of the\r\nInformal Consultative Process was the discussion\r\nfocused on the capacity-building needs of developing\r\ncountries, especially in dealing with issues of ocean\r\nmanagement. The lack of human resources, funds and\r\ntechnology are real obstacles for many developing\r\ncountries. The members of AOSIS want, in particular,\r\nto thank the many delegations that called for special\r\ncapacity-building initiatives for the benefit of small\r\nisland States, owing to their vulnerability to the\r\nadverse effects of climate change and their exposure to\r\nnatural disasters. We note with appreciation that the\r\nmatter of capacity-building needs, especially for least\r\ndeveloped countries, for small island States and for\r\nlow-lying countries, is given emphasis in the draft\r\nresolutions now before the Assembly.\r\nWe very much welcome the proposed\r\nestablishment of trust funds for the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, for the facilitation of\r\nsubmissions to the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf and to assist developing-country\r\nparticipation in the consultative process. Our own\r\ncountries face impediments and real difficulties in\r\nparticipating in international forums dealing with ocean\r\nissues, and the proposals for assistance in this regard\r\nare deeply appreciated. I would need to say, though, on\r\nbehalf of our group, that the provision of funding\r\nassistance to only some of the law of the sea bodies\r\nand not for the benefit of others – such as assistance to\r\nfacilitate participation in the work of the International\r\nSeabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica – is likely to\r\nraise a problem of uneven attention. We would propose\r\nthat consideration might be given to this matter as well.\r\nWe have noted with satisfaction the recent\r\nratifications of the Agreement for the implementation\r\nof the provisions of United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea relating to the conservation and\r\nmanagement of straddling fish stocks and highly\r\nmigratory fish stocks, including that of the Government\r\nof Barbados. We believe that the early entry into force\r\nof that important Agreement would give major\r\nmomentum towards responsible fisheries and the goal\r\nof sustainable development, and we would encourage\r\nmore States to follow the example of those that have\r\nratified the Agreement.\r\nI should like to say that we had expected the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and Agreement on\r\nfish stocks to be among the instruments recommended\r\nfor priority signature and ratification during the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\r\nacknowledge the endeavours of all States involved,\r\nincluding the AOSIS Pacific island States, and the\r\nsignificance of the adoption, in Honolulu last month, of\r\nthe Convention on the Conservation and Management\r\nof Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and\r\nCentral Pacific ocean.\r\nThe livelihood and economies of small island\r\ncommunities are especially dependent on healthy and\r\nproductive fisheries, and this new Convention\r\nrepresents an important development in the\r\nmaintenance of sustainable fisheries resources. We note\r\nthat the Convention incorporates and reflects the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Agreement on fish\r\nstocks.\r\nIn line with our role as custodians of vast areas of\r\nocean space, the AOSIS countries intend to continue to\r\nmaintain their close engagement and participation in all\r\nmatters relating to the oceans and seas.\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nMr. Naidu (Fiji): Fiji fully aligns itself with the\r\ngroup statements delivered earlier by Ambassador Tua\r\nTupou of Tonga on behalf of the South Pacific Group\r\n(SOPAC) and by Ambassador Neroni Slade of Samoa\r\non behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States\r\n(AOSIS).\r\nMy delegation acknowledges with gratitude the\r\nannual report by the Secretary-General on oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea. At the outset, Fiji reaffirms the\r\ntraditional, economic, social, legal and ecological\r\nsignificance that oceans and seas have in the lives of\r\nour people. The Pacific Ocean constitutes the largest\r\nspan of the world’s oceans and living marine resources.\r\nToday, this is particularly significant, because it is\r\ndependent for its protection, conservation and\r\nmanagement largely on small island developing States\r\nin the region — States that are isolated, remote and\r\nseparated by great distances, yet united with a common\r\npurpose to manage sustainably their ocean and sea.\r\nLikewise, Fiji, along with its fellow Pacific\r\nStates, is acutely aware of the importance of ensuring\r\nthe global management of oceans and seas in an\r\nintegrated and sustainable manner, as this not only has\r\nan impact on the Pacific Ocean, but, indeed, affects our\r\nentire ecosystems.\r\nIt is for this reason that Fiji has actively pursued\r\nand facilitated those tasks that will advance United\r\nNations initiatives in our collective search for\r\nsolutions, measures and processes with regard to the\r\noceans and seas. Some of these have already been\r\nhighlighted in the SOPAC statement. In that statement,\r\nFiji recommitted itself to this agenda item and called\r\non all Member States to seize every opportunity to do\r\nlikewise and thereby give life to the legal framework\r\nthat has been set out by the United Nations system in\r\ncompliance with the Charter.\r\nIn this regard, the Pacific region is well advanced\r\nin implementing United Nations agreements and\r\nresolutions, including those touching on fisheries. A\r\ntuna commission was recently established, pursuant to\r\nthe relevant Convention for the conservation and\r\nmanagement of tuna resources in the central and\r\nwestern Pacific.\r\nThe Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), in\r\nestablishing minimum terms for and conditions of\r\naccess for fishing in the exclusive economic zones of\r\nmember States, is implementing United Nations\r\nresolutions promoting responsible fishing practices.\r\nThis will address the growing concerns over illegal,\r\nunregulated and unauthorized fishing.\r\nLike its Pacific neighbours, Fiji has observed its\r\nobligations and carried out relevant tasks in this area\r\ndespite the fragile state of our developing economy. In\r\naddition to taking part in the regional initiatives\r\nmentioned earlier, Fiji regularly reviews and amends its\r\nlegislation to align it with FFA conventions, thus\r\nimplementing United Nations arrangements.\r\nThe support and assistance of developed or\r\nindustrialized countries have been, and will continue to\r\nbe, critical in these endeavours. There has been a\r\nsignificant measure of goodwill in ongoing work at the\r\ninternational, interregional and regional levels.\r\nUnfortunately, there is a sense that there is a risk that\r\nthis positive international commitment may give way\r\nto national or political considerations.\r\nNow, more than ever, Fiji is of the firm view that\r\nongoing measures, initiatives and processes need to be\r\nstrengthened and consolidated. We can forge ahead\r\nwith these goals in this General Assembly session by\r\ntaking a consensus position. Failing that, we can at\r\nleast plead for and look forward to future consensus\r\nand amicable negotiations.\r\nTo this end, my delegation takes seriously the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s mandate to enhance coordination\r\nand cooperation by establishing an open-ended\r\ninformal consultative process to facilitate the annual\r\nreview of ocean affairs by the General Assembly.\r\nFiji joined other members in the first consultative\r\nprocess in May this year and remains hopeful that its\r\noutcome, and future consultative processes leading up\r\nto the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly,\r\nwill leave us all in no doubt about our global capability\r\nto manage ocean affairs, including the international\r\nlegal framework, in a sustainable way, despite the\r\ndifficulties facing that goodwill.\r\nFiji is signalling its unwavering commitment to\r\nthis agenda item by sponsoring draft resolutions\r\nA/55/L.10 and A/55/L.11, and pleads for the spirit of\r\nconsensus to continue to prevail on these issues of\r\ngreat importance to us all.\r\nFinally, I should like to commend delegations for\r\nthe consensus position reached on the two areas of\r\nfocus for the second consultative process, which is to\r\nbe convened in May 2001. These technical and\r\nspecialist topics demand particular skills, both for\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nleading and directing the process and for ensuring\r\noptimal representation and participation by developing\r\nand developed States alike. It is therefore imperative to\r\nadopt the draft resolutions, and to select appropriately\r\nskilled and eminent people to drive the process towards\r\na meaningful outcome.\r\nFiji is confident that, throughout the process, the\r\nfuture reports of the Secretary-General will be further\r\nenriched by the outcomes of the consultative processes,\r\nas was duly mandated by this Assembly.\r\nMiss Ramoutar (Trinidad and Tobago): Trinidad\r\nand Tobago fully associates itself with the statements\r\nmade by Miss Patricia Durrant, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, on behalf of Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) member States, and by\r\nMr. Tuiloma Neroni Slade, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Samoa, on behalf of Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States (AOSIS) member States. We\r\npropose, therefore, only to comment briefly on a few\r\nareas.\r\nThe delegation of Trinidad and Tobago would\r\nlike to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his very comprehensive reports on oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea and on large-scale pelagic drift-net\r\nfishing. We wish to commend, in this regard, the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for\r\nits very valuable contributions and its support to\r\ndelegations on issues relating to oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago welcomed the convening\r\nearlier this year of the first meeting of the Informal\r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the\r\nSea. We wish to commend the Co-Chairs of the\r\nInformal Consultative Process, Ambassador Slade of\r\nSamoa and Mr. Alan Simcock of the United Kingdom,\r\non their very able conduct of the meeting. We believe\r\nthis was a positive first step towards the goal of\r\neffecting greater coordination and cooperation by the\r\ninternational community on issues relating to oceans\r\nand the law of the sea.\r\nThe General Assembly’s endorsement at its\r\nnineteenth special session in 1997 of the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development’s recommendation that\r\nthere should be\r\n“a periodic intergovernmental review by the\r\nCommission of all aspects of the marine\r\nenvironment and its related issues, as described in\r\n... Agenda 21, and for which the overall legal\r\nframework is provided by the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea” (resolution\r\n5/19-2, para. 36)\r\n gave impetus to the new approach by the General\r\nAssembly. We view the outcome of the Process as\r\nuseful, since it provided the opportunity for us to\r\nbenefit from the experience of experts on matters of\r\nconcern to us as a small island developing State. We\r\nlook forward to productive discussions next year on the\r\ntopics we have agreed upon.\r\nDeveloping countries often lack adequate\r\ncapacity in many areas, such as marine science and the\r\ntechnology for the exploitation of the resources of the\r\noceans, the conservation and protection of living\r\nresources and coastal management and for adequately\r\naddressing the growing problem of pollution of the\r\nmarine environment. It is necessary for us to bear in\r\nmind that many small island States and coastal States\r\ndepend on the marine environment for their very\r\nlivelihoods. Participation in discussions on such key\r\ntopics in an international forum can only redound to\r\nthe benefit of developing countries.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago hopes that future meetings\r\nof the Informal Consultative Process will see the\r\nparticipation of a wider cross-section of member\r\nStates, and that they will derive greater benefit from\r\nthe discussions and the input of experts and specialized\r\nagencies. In this regard, we are pleased that under the\r\ndraft omnibus resolution to be adopted the General\r\nAssembly will request the Secretary-General to\r\nestablish a voluntary trust fund for the purpose of\r\nassisting representatives of developing countries, in\r\nparticular least developed countries, small island\r\ndeveloping States and landlocked developing States, to\r\nattend the meetings of the Informal Consultative\r\nProcess. We hope that this measure will enable\r\ndeveloping countries to participate and contribute to\r\nthe work of the Informal Consultative Process in a\r\nmore meaningful manner.\r\nThe willingness of the international community to\r\nestablish the other trust funds set out in the draft\r\nresolution is indicative of its recognition of the\r\nimportance of, and the need for, broader participation\r\nin developments in all areas of oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea. These trust funds relate to assistance to States\r\nin the settlement of disputes before the Tribunal,\r\nparticipation in the work of the Commission on the\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf by its members from\r\ndeveloping States, and assistance to States in preparing\r\nand submitting information with respect to their\r\ncontinental shelves under article 76 and annex II to the\r\nConvention. We are grateful to the States that have\r\ntaken the initiative regarding these trust funds and\r\nappreciate the early indications of support for the\r\nfunds.\r\nWe align ourselves with the sentiments expressed\r\nby the Permanent Representative of Jamaica on behalf\r\nof CARICOM and by the Permanent Representative of\r\nSamoa on behalf of AOSIS regarding the need to\r\nensure greater participation by the international\r\ncommunity – in particular, developing States – in the\r\nwork of the International Seabed Authority. We\r\nreiterate the significance of the Authority’s work and\r\nwelcome the outcome of its work during this year. We\r\necho the recognition of the need to consider a similar\r\ntrust fund to enable greater participation by developing\r\nStates in the sessions of the Authority, which has\r\nsuffered from quorum problems in recent meetings.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago was re-elected to the\r\nCouncil of the Authority earlier this year and remains\r\ncommitted to contributing in a meaningful way to the\r\nongoing work of the Authority. We congratulate\r\nSecretary-General Satya Nandan on his re-election for\r\nanother term, and to assure him of the continued\r\nsupport of the Trinidad and Tobago delegation.\r\nThe achievements of the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea since its establishment in 1996\r\nare to be commended. It is a positive sign that States\r\nare increasingly having recourse to the Tribunal. This\r\nis indicative of the willingness of the international\r\ncommunity to settle disputes by peaceful means in\r\naccordance with international law. Trinidad and Tobago\r\nreiterates its support for the Tribunal as it continues to\r\ndevelop its jurisprudence on the law of the sea.\r\nWe also believe that the very important work of\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf\r\ncan best be accomplished by the contributions of all of\r\nits members, whom we, the international community,\r\nhave entrusted with the task before them. We welcome\r\nthe progress of the work of the Commission this year\r\nand look forward to greater participation by all\r\nmembers in the future. This is particularly important in\r\nlight of the anticipated increase in the workload of the\r\nCommission in the near future.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to highlight once\r\nmore Trinidad and Tobago’s continued objection to the\r\ntrans-shipment of nuclear waste through the Caribbean\r\nSea. The Honourable Ralph Maraj, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Trinidad and\r\nTobago, in his address to the General Assembly on 13\r\nSeptember 2000, lamented the blatant and persistent\r\nmisuse of the Caribbean Sea as a trans-shipment route\r\nfor nuclear waste. This continues to be a cause for\r\nmajor concern to our Government and, indeed, many\r\nothers of the region. We continue to live under the\r\nthreat of a possible accident, knowing full well that a\r\nsingle accident could have devastating consequences\r\nfor present and future generations of our Caribbean\r\npeoples, who are heavily dependent on the marine\r\nenvironment for their livelihood. Accidents can occur,\r\nand we will continue to call for a moratorium on these\r\nshipments through the Caribbean Sea.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago remains firmly committed to\r\nthe principles and purposes of the Convention and is\r\ncommitted to continue to work at the national, regional\r\nand international levels towards the attainment of the\r\nobjectives of the Convention. Since the oceans are key\r\nto the very existence of a large part of the world’s\r\npopulation, it is incumbent upon us, the international\r\ncommunity, to make a concerted effort to ensure\r\ncompliance with, and full implementation of, the\r\nConvention for the greater benefit of all humankind.\r\nMr. Wilson (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):\r\nThe delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\ntakes pleasure in participating in this important debate\r\nand in supporting the draft resolutions relating to this\r\nagenda item. This statement is given fully cognizant of\r\nthe statements made by Her Excellency Miss Patricia\r\nDurrant, Permanent Representative of Jamaica,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community, and His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Slade, Permanent Representative of\r\nSamoa, speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States. This delegation fully endorses those\r\nstatements made on its behalf.\r\nFirst of all, let me say that despite the difficulties\r\ninherent in the reality that my country is an island\r\ndeveloping State, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\ncontinues to strive to carry out its responsibilities under\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\n(UNCLOS) and international law in general. The same\r\napplies to the responsibilities that fall on my country as\r\na maritime nation.\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nWe are particularly happy about the\r\nacknowledgement, in the main draft resolution on\r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/55/L.10), of the\r\ndevelopment of the institutions authorized by the\r\nUNCLOS. Among these are the continued useful\r\ndiscussions and initiatives of the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf and the International\r\nSeabed Authority, especially its mining code. We are\r\nalso pleased to note the steady development of the law\r\nof the sea and related subjects, including the\r\ninterpretation and application of UNCLOS by the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\r\nIn addition to these institutions, there will\r\ninevitably be the need to develop additional processes.\r\nThe newest and most promising process is the United\r\nNations Informal Consultative Process on the Law of\r\nthe Sea (UNICPOLOS), which, we believe, will go\r\nvery far towards helping us to identify ways and means\r\nof reaping some of the numerous potential benefits set\r\nforth in UNCLOS.\r\nAn additional institutional matter is the\r\nrecollection in the main draft resolution of the\r\nobligation of parties to cases before a court or tribunal,\r\nreferred to in article 287 of UNCLOS, to ensure prompt\r\ncompliance with the decisions rendered by such court\r\nor tribunal. This brings to mind similar language\r\nelsewhere, notably in the recent Declaration of the\r\nMillennium Summit. The obligation that I have just\r\nrecalled is an expression of the requirement that, for\r\nour welfare and for good order, the rule of law must be\r\nmaintained by all parties to the Convention and all\r\nMembers of the United Nations. It is therefore of\r\ncrucial importance that judgement debtors should\r\ncomply in full with judgements issued against them. In\r\nthat connection, I recall the judgement given in 1998\r\nby the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nagainst the Republic of Guinea, in the Saiga case,\r\nbrought by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nNon-compliance by the judgement debtor has been the\r\nsubject of several communications to Guinea or its\r\nrepresentatives by and on behalf of the Government\r\nthat I represent. It has also been the subject of a letter\r\nfrom my delegation to the Secretary-General. So far,\r\nhowever, the judgement debt remains unsatisfied.\r\nIt is the hope of my delegation that the judgement\r\ndebtor in the Saiga case will now promptly comply.\r\nMs. Drayton (Guyana): Guyana associates itself\r\nwith the statement delivered by the delegation of\r\nJamaica on behalf of the member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community, as well as the statement made\r\nby the delegation of Samoa on behalf of the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island Developing States. In this regard, and\r\ngiven the hour, I am sure you will be delighted to hear,\r\nSir, that my remarks will be very brief.\r\nGuyana considers that the omnibus text to be\r\nadopted this year on oceans and the law of the sea\r\nreflects important developments made in ocean affairs.\r\nIt is a further step in the process begun at the seventh\r\nsession of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, namely an attempt to find a way for our\r\nannual debate on oceans and the law of the sea to focus\r\non the practical realities of implementation. We are\r\nparticularly pleased at the recognition given to the\r\nnecessity of enhancing support to small-island and\r\nlow-lying coastal developing States, to build their\r\ncapacity so that they can effectively utilize their marine\r\nresources.\r\nThe Informal Consultative Process was, we\r\nbelieve, a very important development in terms of\r\nencouraging a more cohesive consideration of issues\r\nrelated to ocean affairs than has previously been\r\npossible. We were therefore pleased by the active\r\nparticipation of the various agencies and institutions\r\ninvolved in the management of various aspects of\r\noceans affairs in the Consultative Process. We consider\r\nthat the promotion of a dialogue between these\r\ninstitutions and between the institutions and\r\nGovernments to be one of the most positive\r\nachievements of the Process. I would also like to take\r\nthis opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Neroni\r\nSlade of Samoa and Mr. Alan Simcock of the United\r\nKingdom for one of the most professionally executed\r\nchairmanships it has been my privilege to witness.\r\nGuyana is not singular among Governments in\r\nfinding it an increasing challenge to keep up with the\r\nmany initiatives promoted each year in the course of\r\nour deliberations on various items. As a small country,\r\nwe find it a formidable task to implement the\r\ncommitments we undertake, to prioritize among them\r\nso as to ensure the most efficient use of our limited\r\nresources, both technical and financial, and, most of\r\nall, to keep current with those commitments so that we\r\ndo not inadvertently overlook key responsibilities or\r\nobligations.\r\nWe therefore welcome the comprehensive nature\r\nof the omnibus draft resolution before us, which neatly\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nencompasses both legal commitments, as well as\r\nrecommendations that will allow us to pursue our\r\nsustainable development goals. Guyana is of the view\r\nthat the reflection of sustainable development concerns\r\nunder the umbrella of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) helps to breathe life\r\ninto UNCLOS, as originally envisaged.\r\nThe commitments reflected in chapter 17 of\r\nAgenda 21 were, of course, negotiated within the\r\ncontext of the relevant provisions of UNCLOS. The\r\neight years since the adoption of Agenda 21, however,\r\nhave eloquently demonstrated that, while an integrated\r\napproach is easy to recommend in principle, its\r\nimplementation can be frustratingly elusive,\r\nparticularly in light of the many institutional partners\r\ninvolved.\r\nAs we are all aware, negotiations on the draft text\r\nwere not easy. Guyana would like to commend all the\r\ndelegations that participated for their demonstrated\r\ncommitment to achieving a consensus text. This spirit\r\nof flexibility and compromise was particularly\r\nevidenced by developing countries, which negotiated\r\nconstructively despite their very valid concerns at\r\nbeing inadequately represented during the Consultative\r\nProcess.\r\nWe hope that future meetings of the Consultative\r\nProcess will benefit from the full range of views on\r\nissues of concern to delegations. Topics of particular\r\ninterest to delegations have been identified in the\r\nomnibus text; this should enable early preparation for\r\nthe next meeting by both the Co-Chairpersons, as well\r\nas delegations. We particularly urge contributions to\r\nthe trust fund, so as to enable the next meeting to be\r\nbetter informed of the views of experts from\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn our efforts at implementation and coordination,\r\nit is important to bear in mind one of the key\r\nunderlying principles of the Convention: the oceans\r\nand their resources beyond the limits of national\r\njurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind.\r\nGuyana remains committed to the continued\r\nimplementation of the Convention to ensure the\r\neffective management and sustainable development of\r\nthe oceans and seas. We join others in urging those\r\nStates that have not yet become parties to the\r\nConvention and the Agreement implementing Part XI\r\nof the Convention to do so in the near future.\r\nMr. Anwar (Indonesia): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the comprehensive and\r\ninformative reports on the item before us. They outline\r\nthe extensive activities that have been undertaken and\r\nconstitute a significant chronicle of the progress made\r\nduring the past year. Allow me to also convey our\r\ngratitude for the untiring efforts exerted by the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea as\r\nwell as other related institutions provided for by the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThese endeavours have provided the necessary impetus\r\nfor the effective implementation of the Convention,\r\nnamely uniformity and consistency.\r\nDuring the current year, three more States have\r\nratified the Convention, bringing the number of States\r\nparties to 135. It is our earnest hope that this positive\r\ntrend will increase and that the Convention will thus\r\nachieve its goal of universal participation. We urge the\r\nMember States that have not done so to consider\r\nratifying the Convention. This historic document has\r\ncreated an essential legal framework for the peaceful\r\nuse of the world’s oceans and seas.\r\nWe are pleased to note that since the\r\nestablishment of the institutions envisaged by the\r\nConvention, including the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, these have recorded considerable\r\nprogress. Indonesia will continue its active\r\nparticipation in the deliberations of these institutions\r\nand lends its support to strengthening their\r\neffectiveness.\r\nIt is a matter of satisfaction that the International\r\nSeabed Authority held its sixth session on from 3 to 14\r\nJuly 2000 and considered several important issues,\r\nincluding the budget for the financial period 2000-\r\n2001; the rules of procedure of the Legal and Technical\r\nCommission; the adoption and provisional application\r\nof the Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for\r\nPolymetallic Nodules in the Area; and the need to\r\nreach agreement on the number and distribution of\r\nseats on the Legal and Technical Commission. We hope\r\nthat the International Seabed Authority will record\r\nfurther progress on the issue of signing contracts with\r\npioneer investors.\r\nIt was indeed an auspicious occasion when the\r\nTribunal’s new premises were officially opened on\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\n3 July 2000 in the presence of the Secretary-General\r\nand other high-ranking dignitaries. In the four years\r\nsince its establishment, the Tribunal, which is\r\ncomposed of persons of recognized competence in the\r\nfield of the law of the sea, has already handed down\r\nfour decisions, thereby encouraging Member States to\r\nresolve their disputes peacefully and without undue\r\ndelay.\r\nWe also acknowledge with appreciation the\r\nsmooth implementation of the Agreement on\r\nCooperation and Relationship between the United\r\nNations and the Tribunal, as well as the steps taken to\r\nextend the jurisdiction of the United Nations\r\nAdministrative Tribunal to the staff and members of\r\nthe Registry of the Tribunal. We also commend the\r\nefforts of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea for promptly placing the records of the\r\nTribunal and the verbatim transcripts of the hearings of\r\nthe cases before it on the Web site of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs to the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, we are pleased to note its efforts in\r\nfocusing on training to assist coastal States, especially\r\ndeveloping nations, in preparing their submissions to\r\nthe Commission. Equally important are its discussions\r\nconcerning the methodology for dealing with these\r\nsubmissions at the subcommission level.\r\nWe welcome the growing awareness of the oceans\r\nand their resources. The conservation and sustainable\r\nuse of living marine resources are of critical\r\nimportance to both present and future generations.\r\nSimilarly, it is beyond doubt that an enhanced\r\nsustainable yield from the oceans is central to ensuring\r\nprosperity for peoples that depend on resources from\r\nthe sea for their livelihood. In order to develop a\r\ncomprehensive framework for the effective\r\nmanagement of their ecosystems, developing countries\r\nhave to be enabled to become equal partners through\r\ncooperation, partnership and development. In this way,\r\ndeveloping countries will be able to participate\r\neffectively in the acquisition of an equitable share of\r\nthe resources of the oceans.\r\nThe preservation of the marine environment has\r\nbeen one of Indonesia’s national priorities since the\r\nearly 1980s. Indonesia’s efforts to protect the marine\r\nenvironment have been further strengthened by the\r\nratification of a number of international conventions. It\r\nis also a party to various regional treaties to combat oil\r\npollution. In support of its ratification of the\r\nconventions, the Indonesian Government has\r\npromulgated legal instruments ranging from basic\r\nenvironmental laws to fisheries as well as laws\r\nconcerning the exclusive economic zone and the\r\nconservation of living resources. While recognizing the\r\ncomplexity of the issues at hand and the need for better\r\ncoordination and management of the marine\r\nenvironment, it has already initiated a range of\r\nprogrammes that are indicative of its commitment to\r\nthe sustainable use of coastal resources.\r\nThe General Assembly, at its fifty-fourth session,\r\ndecided, consistent with the legal framework provided\r\nby the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea and the goals of chapter 17 of Agenda 21, to\r\nestablish an open-ended informal consultative process\r\nto enhance coordination and cooperation on issues\r\nrelating to oceans and seas at the intergovernmental\r\nand inter-agency levels.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation has noted with\r\ninterest the report on the work of the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea at its first meeting, held earlier\r\nthis year. The fact that consensus was achieved on a\r\nnumber of issues to be placed before the General\r\nAssembly for further consideration was a good\r\nbeginning for future deliberations. We believe that the\r\nprocess has an important role to play in identifying\r\nissues of concern and in according priority to the\r\nactions that need to be taken at the global, regional and\r\nnational levels. Furthermore, the ongoing discussions\r\nshould not pre-empt other forms of deliberation.\r\nRather, these consultations should be aimed towards\r\npromoting cooperation and coordination among\r\ninstitutions within the United Nations system as well as\r\nproviding adequate coordination with the Meeting of\r\nthe States Parties.\r\nThe draft convention for the protection of the\r\nunderwater cultural heritage is another achievement in\r\nthe creation of a legal framework in that area aimed at\r\npreserving that heritage for the benefit of humankind.\r\nWe commend the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for its\r\ntireless endeavours and remain confident that\r\ngovernmental experts will conclude their work on the\r\ndraft at the earliest possible time. The new instrument\r\nshould complement the relevant provisions of the\r\nConvention, in particular those concerning the rights of\r\nsovereign States and the jurisdiction of coastal States.\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nCrimes at sea, especially piracy and armed\r\nrobbery, pose a threat to the security of coastal States,\r\nthe safety of navigation and seafarers. In this regard,\r\ncooperation at all levels should be intensified. The\r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO) also has an\r\nimportant role to play in preventing and combating\r\ncrimes.\r\nFinally, in my delegation’s view, the\r\nConvention’s standing as one of the historic landmarks\r\nin the consolidation of law and order in the area of the\r\noceans and seas is in keeping with the loftiest ideals of\r\njustice and respect for the interests and rights of every\r\nState and its peoples. It is therefore our collective\r\nobligation to ensure that in the years to come future\r\ngenerations benefit greatly from the living and non-\r\nliving resources of our oceans and seas, within the\r\nparameters of the legal framework established by the\r\nConvention.\r\nMr. Lippwe (Micronesia): At the outset, I would\r\nlike, on behalf of the Federated States of Micronesia\r\ndelegation, to associate ourselves with the statements\r\nmade earlier by the representative of Samoa on behalf\r\nof the Alliance of Small Island States and by the\r\nrepresentative of Tonga on behalf of the Pacific Island\r\nForum countries at the United Nations.\r\nI thank Mr. Holkeri for convening this meeting on\r\nsuch an important and vital subject. My delegation is\r\nvery grateful for the diligent work of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and welcomes his useful report on this agenda\r\nitem. We acknowledge also the very important work\r\ncarried out by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the\r\nLaw of the Sea.\r\nSince we last discussed this agenda item at the\r\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, we are\r\npleased to note significant progress in this area. In\r\nparticular, the successful convening of the United\r\nNations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on\r\nOcean and the Law of the Sea at its first meeting\r\nearlier this year is a significant achievement and a step\r\nin the right direction for the United Nations in its\r\nefforts to review developments in the area of ocean\r\naffairs. The States Members of this United Nations\r\nmust continue to lend their support to this process if we\r\nare to achieve true and meaningful discussions on an\r\nimportant common heritage of mankind — the oceans.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the signing of the\r\nConvention on the Conservation and Management of\r\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and\r\nCentral Pacific Ocean, made pursuant to the Agreement\r\nfor the Implementation of the Provisions of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea of\r\n10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks. Implementation of this new\r\nConvention ensures the rational conservation,\r\nmanagement and, thus, sustainability of migratory fish\r\nstocks in the Convention Area.\r\nMy delegation commends the cooperation and\r\ngoodwill shown by our fellow Pacific Island nations in\r\nthe negotiations of the Convention. Most notable is the\r\nparticipation of small island countries like my own. For\r\nthem, participation constitutes a great compromise of\r\nexclusive rights previously gained through the\r\nexclusive-economic-zone regime of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Also,\r\nfor many if not all of the small island parties, the\r\nresource over which they are sharing exclusive rights\r\nwith others is the single most economically significant\r\none and the only resource over which our economic\r\nfuture can be assured. In cooperating, and even\r\nsacrificing so that our fellow men may benefit, we\r\nhope that others will also cooperate with us by paying\r\ngreater attention to the many plights of small island\r\ncountries.\r\nMy delegation knows too well the significance\r\nthat the ocean plays in the lives of our own people. Our\r\nhistory began in the days when man explored seas in\r\nrafts and canoes. We who remain continue to rely\r\nheavily on the bounties of the ocean and are proud\r\nguardians of this heritage for our common humanity.\r\nDespite all the efforts undertaken by the\r\ninternational community, the state of the oceans\r\nremains precarious. Indiscriminate destruction of ocean\r\nresources by large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, while\r\ngenerally on the decline, remains a threat to marine\r\nliving resources. This activity is clearly in\r\ncontravention of the terms of the moratorium agreed to\r\nby the international community in General Assembly\r\nresolution 46/215. We call upon States that have not\r\ndone so to take immediate and effective measures to\r\nban illegal drift-net fishing.\r\nThe incidence of unauthorized fishing in zones of\r\nnational jurisdiction and on the high seas, and of\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing continue to\r\nbe of concern to my delegation. The vast exclusive\r\neconomic zone under my country’s jurisdiction, rich in\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nfish resources and one of the principle resources for the\r\neconomic development of my country, requires careful\r\nmanagement and monitoring to address illegal,\r\nunregulated and unreported fishing. My country, like\r\nany other small island developing State, simply cannot\r\nact alone, but requires the cooperation of other States\r\nto take greater enforcement measures to ensure that\r\ntheir vessels do not fish in areas of national\r\njurisdiction. To maximize effectiveness, States must\r\nensure that, even when their vessels are authorized to\r\nfish in areas of national jurisdiction, they comply with\r\nthe terms of that authorization. We support the draft\r\nresolution now before this Assembly on large-scale\r\npelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones\r\nof national jurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries\r\nby-catch and discards, and other developments, and we\r\nurge all delegations to actively support it.\r\nHaving made this plea, my delegation would like\r\nto note its concern over the issue of fisheries by-catch\r\nand discards. While by-catch and discards are\r\nunderstandably the result of untargeted or incidental\r\ncatches — call them collateral victims of fishing\r\nmethods, if you will — the issue is nevertheless one\r\nthat deserves a greater focus of attention. Some of the\r\nfish species that usually constitute by-catches and\r\ndiscards — especially the smaller species, which are\r\neasily catchable — are important to the daily diet of\r\nisland people. What may be discarded by some as\r\nunsuitable for commercial mass consumption are\r\nactually important to the subsistence livelihood of\r\nisland people. Therefore, we should not squander this\r\nGod-given food resource just because it ends up in the\r\nwrong net. Instead, the international community should\r\nstrive more strongly to minimize the incidence of\r\ncollateral catches in fisheries in order to conserve\r\nresources and ensure biodiversity.\r\nWe are encouraged by the heightened\r\ninternational attention to the needs of small island\r\ndeveloping States in their capacity-building process.\r\nKey to increasing the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations and the international community in dealing\r\ncomprehensively with ocean issues is strengthening the\r\ncapacities of these countries who together control a\r\nvast portion of the Earth’s ocean. We note the call\r\nmade in the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/55/L.10 for the establishment of trust funds to\r\nprovide training for technical and administrative staff,\r\nparticularly of the least developed countries and small\r\nisland States, as well as to facilitate their participation\r\nat the meetings of the Consultative Process.\r\nWe suggest that assistance not be limited to\r\nattendance at the Consultative Process, but should\r\ninclude other law-of-the-sea bodies, such as the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, where meetings\r\ncontinue to be sparsely attended by small island States,\r\ndue to financial difficulties. As stewards and\r\nstakeholders of these resources, our participation in\r\nthese processes is a critical element if we are to\r\neffectively combat the many daunting issues affecting\r\nour world’s ocean.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the use of the trust\r\nfunds to assist small island States in their submissions\r\nto the Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf. As a small island State with meagre resources\r\nand limited technical know-how, my country requires\r\nthe assistance of the international community, both in\r\nterms of financial and technical support, to meet its\r\nobligations under UNCLOS. We therefore call for the\r\ngenerous support of the developed countries and donor\r\ncommunity to contribute financially or otherwise to the\r\ntrust funds.\r\nLast but not least, noting the significant trend\r\ntowards universal participation and adherence to the\r\nlegal regime established by the Convention, we\r\nreiterate the call by many other delegations for those\r\nStates that have not ratified it to do so. As the United\r\nNations continues to seek effective means to preserve\r\nan important heritage of mankind, our ability to\r\npreserve it successfully depends to a large extent on the\r\nratification and implementation of the Convention and\r\nits associated instruments.\r\nMr. Tarabrin (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Russia has consistently called for a higher\r\nprofile for the role of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea as an important universal\r\ninstrument of international law, established to develop\r\ncooperation between States for the sustainable use and\r\nexploration of the oceans and their resources.\r\nWe welcome the growing number of parties to the\r\nConvention and the fact that its institutions — the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf — are becoming\r\nmore and more active. Their activities strengthen the\r\neffective and consistent application of the standards of\r\ninternational marine law, and it is important that we\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nshould provide for making the broadest possible use of\r\nthese institutions.\r\nWe also welcome the fact that voluntary funds are\r\nbeing set up partly in order to strengthen the work of\r\nStates, particularly developing States, and to make it\r\neasier for them to enjoy their rights and fulfil their\r\nobligations in the work of the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf. We share the concern\r\nof the Secretary-General that domestic law is often at\r\nodds with the standards enshrined in the Convention.\r\nWe are also concerned about the activities of certain\r\ninternational entities targeted at changing the legal\r\nregime established by the Convention, particularly the\r\nprinciple of an exclusive economic zone.\r\nThe Russian Federation calls for the preservation\r\nof the integrity of the high seas regime established\r\nunder the Convention. It is our view that any attempt to\r\ntackle law of the sea problems separately from that\r\nregime will have an adverse effect on our universal\r\nregime to regulate the oceans. We are also against any\r\nsignificant deviations from that regime when new\r\ninternational agreements on the use of and exploration\r\nfor living and non-living marine resources are\r\nconcluded. We believe that coordination on the basic\r\naspects of international law regulating marine activity\r\nshould remain at the centre of the attention of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in its discussions.\r\nThere is serious concern over illegal trafficking in\r\nweapons and drugs and illegal migration using the high\r\nseas. Piracy and armed robbery must also be met with a\r\ndecisive international rebuttal. We welcome the fact\r\nthat the effort to combat transnational organized crime\r\nhas been stepped up, in particular the measures which\r\nhave been adopted in this respect by the International\r\nMaritime Organization. We consider it most timely that\r\nduring the Informal Consultative Process on marine\r\nmatters we should discuss coordinating and\r\ncooperating to combat piracy and armed robbery.\r\nNo less important if we are to establish peaceful,\r\nsustainable economic activities on the high seas is\r\ntackling the problem of how we are to preserve the\r\nmarine environment while managing and protecting our\r\nmarine resources. The Russian Federation views these\r\nprovisions of the Convention and of Agenda 21 as a\r\nprogramme that provides for sustainable development\r\nof seas and oceans at the national, regional and the\r\nglobal levels. Nevertheless, we cannot fail to be\r\nseriously concerned about the problem of\r\nimplementing these international instruments and in\r\nparticular about the fact that many developing\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed countries\r\nand the small island States, do not have the necessary\r\nmaterial and financial resources, or indeed the\r\nscientific and engineering potential, to fully implement\r\nthe Convention and Agenda 21. In this respect, we\r\nsupport the appeal to organizations that offer\r\ninternational development assistance to concentrate\r\nparticularly on establishing in developing countries the\r\neconomic, legal and scientific infrastructures that they\r\nneed to make sustainable use of the oceans and their\r\nresources and also effectively to enjoy their rights and\r\nimplement their commitments as laid down in these\r\ndocuments.\r\nWe consider that we should also tackle this issue,\r\nas provided for in draft resolution A/55/L.10, by\r\ndiscussing how to enhance international cooperation in\r\nthe field of marine scientific research and the transfer\r\nof marine technology, consistent with the principles\r\nand criteria enshrined in the Convention.\r\nOn the subject of the problems of large-scale\r\npelagic drift-net fishing and the related issues of\r\nsustainable management of our living marine resources\r\nand their conservation, we would like to stress that the\r\ndepletion of living resources in some parts of the\r\noceans and the emergence of new serious threats to the\r\nenvironment all go to make the defence of the marine\r\nenvironment and its effective and balanced\r\nconservation a priority task for the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn 1997 the Russian Federation was one of the\r\nfirst nations to ratify the Agreement relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. We view this\r\nAgreement as an important staging post in the\r\nimplementation of the Convention and as a\r\ncompendium of international standards laying down the\r\nparameters for cooperation between States with regard\r\nto fishing and the conservation of fish stocks. For us it\r\nis a matter of exceptional importance that the\r\nAgreement should enter into force as soon as possible,\r\nwith a broad partnership of States, and be effectively\r\nimplemented in order to conserve and manage\r\nstraddling fish stocks and protect the marine\r\nenvironment.\r\nAt the national level we have adopted an\r\nintegrated series of measures to implement the Code of\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nConduct for Responsible Fisheries and the Agreement\r\non straddling fish stocks. The Russian Federation, in\r\nfull compliance with our national fishing regulations,\r\ndoes not carry out any type of commercial drift-net\r\nfishing at all. We call for the adoption of targeted\r\nmeasures for the rational use of our fish resources,\r\nincluding by decreasing the intensity with which we\r\nfish. Russia supports the approval by the United\r\nNations Food and Agriculture Organization Committee\r\non Fisheries of the international plans of action for\r\nreducing the incidental take of seabirds in longline\r\nfisheries, for the conservation and management of\r\nsharks and for the management of fishing capacity.\r\nAnother priority for us is the effort at all levels to\r\ncombat smuggling and illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing. For that reason we support the\r\ncontents of draft resolution A/55/L.11, under agenda\r\nitem 34(b), as an appeal to all States and international\r\norganizations with appropriate jurisdiction to take\r\naction to deal with such illegal and unregulated fishing.\r\nThe General Assembly’s annual overview\r\ndiscussion of the issues of oceans and the law of the\r\nsea gives Member States the opportunity to state their\r\nviews on those topics which are most urgent. The\r\noceans and the seas are different and special when it\r\ncomes to the need for international coordination and\r\ncooperation, and they require a comprehensive global\r\napproach to the consideration of their legal, economic,\r\nsocial and environmental aspects.\r\nIn this respect, Russia, as a great sea Power, sets\r\ngreat store by what happens on the high seas and\r\nintends actively to continue its support for the drive to\r\nimprove cooperation between States in the exploration\r\nand use of the oceans and seas and to further strengthen\r\nthe international legal regime established by the United\r\nNations Law of the Sea.\r\nAnd, finally, may I say how highly we appreciate\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report contained in document\r\nA/55/61 and we are also grateful to those members of\r\nthe Secretariat who deal with the law of the sea for all\r\ntheir hard work to produce this document.\r\nMr. Donigi (Papua and New Guinea): I am\r\ndeeply saddened by the recent death of Mr. Justice\r\nLihai Zhao, a member of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea. I offer my Government’s sincere\r\ncondolences to the family of the late Judge Zhao and to\r\nthe Government of the Peoples Republic of China.\r\nI take the floor at this juncture in my capacity the\r\nPresident of the Tenth Meeting of the States Parties to\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe Registrar of the Tribunal will soon be calling\r\nfor nominations to fill the vacant seat on the Tribunal\r\npursuant to the provisions of Annex VI to the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Whilst\r\nthere is a procedure for the calling of nominations, the\r\nConvention only requires the President of the Tribunal\r\nto consult with States parties in setting a date for the\r\nelection. The next meeting of the States parties is\r\nscheduled for 14-18 May 2001. Member States may be\r\nrequested to give due consideration as to whether or\r\nnot there will be a need for scheduling a special\r\nmeeting to elect a replacement judge or to wait until\r\nthe scheduled meeting in May. At a time, when States\r\nparties are more cost conscious, it may be wise to\r\nschedule the election during the States parties meeting\r\nin May 2001 and not at an earlier date, especially when\r\nthe vacancy will not unduly affect the work of the\r\nTribunal.\r\nThe Tenth Meeting of the States Parties to\r\nUNCLOS was held from 22 to 26 May 2000. The\r\nmeeting noted that Nicaragua had deposited its\r\ninstrument of ratification and was scheduled to become\r\nthe 133rd State party on 2 June 2000. I note also that\r\nMaldives and Luxembourg have since ratified the\r\nConvention, bringing the total to 135. The Convention\r\nis increasingly becoming a unique instrument of\r\ninternational law, as can be seen by the number of\r\nStates that have became parties to it. The Convention is\r\nunique because it contains a set of criteria and\r\nprinciples outlining the understanding reached between\r\nStates possessing the technological skills, expertise and\r\nequipment and those whose lives depend on the\r\nbounties of the oceans and the resources of the seabed.\r\nThe priority agenda for the meeting was the draft\r\nbudget of the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea, the Financial Regulations of the Tribunal, the\r\nReport of External Auditors and the Rules of Procedure\r\nfor the Meeting of State Parties, in particular Rule 53\r\ndealing with decisions on questions of substance.\r\nAnother matter dealt with at the meeting was a request\r\nby the President of the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf to finance participation by\r\nmembers of the Commission from developing\r\ncountries. The President of the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea, Mr. Justice Rao, submitted the\r\nannual report of the Tribunal to the meeting and also\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\naddressed the meeting. The Secretary-General of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority also addressed the\r\nmeeting.\r\nThe report of the Tenth Meeting of the States\r\nParties to UNCLOS is contained in document\r\nSPLOS/60 dated 22 June 2000 and can be found on the\r\nweb site of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea.\r\nI wish, through you, Mr. President, to extend my\r\nsincere gratitude to the members of the Division for\r\ntheir assistance, advice and support during the States\r\nparties meeting and the negotiations relating to the\r\ndraft resolutions before the Assembly.\r\nI draw the attention of members in particular to\r\nthe following salient matters outlined in the Report:\r\nThe Tribunal has dealt with five cases, some\r\ninvolving provisional measures and others calling for\r\nmore detailed analysis of the issues in dispute. Its\r\norders and judgements have, on the whole, been\r\nfollowed by disputants, which attests to the importance\r\nof the Tribunal.\r\nThe budget of the Tribunal has been increased\r\nslightly, and I commend all delegations that\r\nparticipated in the negotiations and acceptance of the\r\noutcome.\r\nA number of delegations proposed amendments\r\nto the Financial Regulations of the Tribunal during the\r\nmeeting. The Meeting therefore requested the\r\nSecretariat to prepare a revised version of the Financial\r\nRegulations taking into account the proposals and the\r\noutcome of the discussions at the ninth and tenth\r\nmeetings for consideration at the eleventh meeting.\r\nThe report of the External Auditors for the\r\nfinancial years 1998 and 1999 were submitted by the\r\nRegistrar of the Tribunal and considered. The meeting\r\ntook note of the 1998 External Auditors’ Report and\r\ndeferred consideration of the 1999 Report until the\r\neleventh meeting as it had yet to be considered by the\r\nTribunal.\r\nThe delegation of United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland proposed the\r\nestablishment of a trust fund to provide States with\r\nfinancial assistance in proceedings before the Tribunal\r\nsimilar to the one established for the International\r\nCourt of Justice. The meeting agreed that such a fund\r\nshould be established. I note with great appreciation\r\nthat delegations participating in the negotiations on the\r\nomnibus draft resolution on the law of the sea have\r\nagreed to this proposal as contained in paragraph 7 of\r\nAnnex I of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/55/L.10.\r\nThe meeting was informed that the Council of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority had adopted the\r\nFinancial Regulations of the Authority and that\r\nsubstantive progress had been made on the draft\r\nregulations for prospecting and exploration for\r\npolymetallic nodules. I note that since the meeting, the\r\nCouncil of the International Seabed Authority had\r\nadopted the regulations, thereby making it possible for\r\nthe seven pioneer investors to execute contracts to\r\ncarry out this activity within the Area. I note that\r\nparagraph 7 of the omnibus draft resolution deals with\r\nthis subject. I urge all the pioneer investors through\r\ntheir respective member States to proceed to execute\r\ntheir respective contracts with the Authority, as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nThe meeting adopted a decision to recommend to\r\nthe General Assembly the establishment of a voluntary\r\ntrust fund for the purpose of defraying the costs of\r\nparticipation of the members of the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf from developing\r\ncountries in the meetings of the Commission. I am glad\r\nthat this decision has been reflected in paragraph 20 of\r\nthe omnibus draft resolution.\r\nThe meeting further decided to recommend to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the establishment of additional\r\nvoluntary trust funds for the purposes of: (a) providing\r\nassistance to States Parties to meet obligations under\r\narticle 76 of the Convention and (b) providing training\r\nto countries, in particular the least developed among\r\nthem and small island developing States, for preparing\r\nsubmissions to the Commission with respect to the\r\nouter limits of the continental shelf beyond 200\r\nnautical miles, as appropriate. This decision is now\r\nreflected in paragraphs 9 and 19 and Annex II of the\r\nomnibus draft resolution. I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to especially thank the Government and\r\ndelegation of Norway for their constructive approach\r\nand their work in drafting the relevant paragraphs and\r\nTerms of Reference, Guidelines and Rules which\r\nformed the basis of the negotiations leading to the\r\nfinalization of the text contained in the omnibus draft\r\nresolution. Of concern to some delegations is the 10-\r\nyear limit for compliance with article 4 of Annex II to\r\nUNCLOS. This will become a subject for an additional\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\nagenda item for the eleventh meeting of the States\r\nparties. Discussions on decisions affecting questions of\r\nsubstance were deferred to the eleventh meeting. Some\r\ndelegations were opposed to the proposal to introduce a\r\nweighted voting system on matters of substance.\r\nLikewise, a proposal to establish a finance committee\r\nfor reviewing the budget of the Tribunal was also\r\ndeferred to the eleventh meeting.\r\nExtensive consultations were held in respect of a\r\nproposal by Chile for the inclusion of an item in the\r\nnext Meeting of the States parties to be entitled either\r\n“Implementation of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea” or “Issues of a general nature\r\nrelated to the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea”. Divergent views were expressed at the\r\nmeeting. It was agreed to include in the agenda of the\r\neleventh meeting an item entitled “Matters related to\r\narticle 319 of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea”.\r\nAnother matter that required further study was a\r\nproposal for an African institute for oceans affairs.\r\nSince the tenth Meeting of State Parties, the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, received, at a ceremony on behalf of the\r\nTribunal of the Law of the Sea in the Free and\r\nHanseatic City of Hamburg, witnessed by the Judges,\r\nthe key to the new premises of the Tribunal. My\r\nGovernment — and I am confident the Governments of\r\nall participating States would want to join us —\r\nacknowledges and welcomes this gift from the\r\nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Germany.\r\nIn my capacity as head of my delegation, I\r\nendorse fully the contents of the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of Tonga, His Excellency Ambassador\r\nTupou, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Forum Group\r\nof Countries and on behalf of his own delegation.\r\nHowever, I would wish to make a few comments.\r\nMany delegations have referred to the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea, otherwise known by its\r\nacronym UNICPOLOS. The first meeting of\r\nUNICPOLOS produced some positive results. These\r\nwere reflected in the omnibus draft resolution before\r\nus. My delegation specifically noted the active\r\nparticipation of delegations during the negotiations\r\nleading up to the finalization of the omnibus draft\r\nresolution now before this Assembly. We are confident\r\nthat this renewed interest in the affairs of the oceans\r\nand its resources could not have come about without\r\nUNICPOLOS.\r\nWe look forward to the second meeting of\r\nUNICPOLOS, scheduled for early May 2001. The\r\nsubject of marine science and development and transfer\r\nof marine technology and capacity-building in these\r\nfields are important to my Government, as it is the first\r\nGovernment to issue commercial exploration licenses\r\nfor deep-sea exploration of the seabed within its\r\nnational jurisdiction.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the rearrangement of\r\nmeetings next year, so that UNICPOLOS will meet one\r\nweek before the meeting of the States parties. The\r\nmeeting of the States parties will therefore have the\r\nbenefit of the outcome of the UNICPOLOS meeting\r\nprior to its deliberations.\r\nPiracy and armed robbery at sea are also of\r\nconcern to us. It is a problem among some of our\r\nneighbouring States. We are concerned that some of\r\nthese illegal activities may affect our nationals and\r\nimpinge on the area of our national jurisdiction. We\r\ntherefore support any constructive debate to find\r\nsolutions or develop appropriate measures to combat\r\nthese illegal activities.\r\nOn the question of fisheries, we welcome the\r\nConvention on the Conservation and Management of\r\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in Western and Central\r\nPacific Ocean, concluded in Hawaii on 4 September\r\n2000. My Government participated for six years in the\r\nnegotiations leading up to the conclusion of this\r\nConvention. We believe it is consistent with UNCLOS\r\nand the United Nations Agreement on Fish Stocks. We\r\nurge Governments that participated in the negotiations\r\nand have expressed reservations during the concluding\r\nphase to reverse their position and agree to be parties\r\nto the new Convention.\r\nI have heard the reasons put forward by Australia\r\nthis afternoon and found them to be overwhelmingly\r\nconvincing in this regard. My Government also wishes\r\nto thank all those Governments that have contributed to\r\nthe Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial\r\nFellowship Programme on the Law of the Sea. We are\r\npleased that a young Papua New Guinean lawyer was\r\nthe beneficiary of this fellowship this year, and we\r\nthank the contributing Governments for facilitating her\r\nstudy programme in Germany and with the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea here in New\r\nYork. My delegation also wishes to join others in\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.43\r\ncongratulating Ambassador Satya Nandan on his\r\nunanimous re-election as the Secretary-General of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority.\r\nMy delegation endorses both draft resolutions\r\nbefore this Assembly.\r\nMr. Al-Dailmi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, my delegation expresses its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report,\r\ncontained in document A/55/61, on the oceans and the\r\nseas.\r\nThe marine environment constitutes an economic\r\nand human priority for my country. It is a primary\r\nsource of livelihood for many people in my country,\r\nespecially on the eastern and southern coasts.\r\nProceeding from this premise, my delegation maintains\r\nthat, without compromising Yemeni laws, the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea is one of the\r\ncornerstones of the legal framework of sea and ocean\r\nmatters because of its strategic importance as the\r\nframework for national, regional and international\r\nwork related to the seas. The marine environment,\r\nincluding the oceans, seas and adjacent coastal areas, is\r\nan integral whole and represents one of the main\r\ncomponents of the international system for the\r\nsustenance of life, providing basic resources for food\r\nsecurity and continuity of economic prosperity for\r\npresent and future generations. It is the international\r\ncommunity’s responsibility to provide the necessary\r\nframework to protect the marine environment from all\r\ndangers.\r\nWe wish to emphasize the importance of\r\necological systems in the seas and in coastal areas in\r\ncombating poverty and achieving food security. Illegal\r\nand unregulated fishing is a violation of international\r\nlaw. We appreciate efforts made to control illegal and\r\nunreported fishing. All countries should have\r\ncomplementary mechanisms and measures in this\r\nregard. My delegation attaches great importance to\r\ncooperation and coordination at all levels —\r\ninternational, regional and national — since they are\r\nconducive to the preservation of ocean and sea\r\nresources and its necessary sustainable development.\r\nWe are one of the countries that has signed the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. We consistently\r\nparticipate in meetings and cooperate and coordinate\r\nwith all the parties. Conflicts over territorial waters and\r\nislands are among the problems that impede\r\ndevelopment and the protection of marine life. We\r\nemphasize the view that conflicts should be settled\r\npeacefully, an approach adopted by my country in\r\nsettling all conflicts with all our neighbours.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill hear the remaining speakers and will take action\r\non draft resolutions A/55/L.10 and A/55/L.11 on\r\nMonday morning, 30 October, as the first item\r\nat 10 a.m.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to make an\r\nannouncement concerning the programme of work of\r\nthe General Assembly for the morning of Monday, 30\r\nOctober, which appears in today’s Journal. Draft\r\nresolutions A/55/L.14, A/55/L.17 and A/55/L.18, as\r\nwell as draft decision A/55/L.5, are now available at\r\nthe document distribution counters in the General\r\nAssembly Hall and in the first basement.\r\nI should also like to announce two additions to\r\nthe programme of work for the end of next week. On\r\nthe morning of Thursday, 2 November 2000, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will take up, as the second item,\r\nagenda item 179, entitled “Review of the problem\r\nof human immunodeficiency virus/acquired\r\nimmunodeficiency syndrome in all its aspects”, which\r\nwas postponed from 3 October 2000. Members are\r\naware that draft resolution A/55/L.13, under agenda\r\nitem 179, has already been issued.\r\nOn the morning of Friday, 3 November 2000, as\r\nthe second item, the General Assembly will take up\r\nagenda item 61, entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations system”. Draft resolution A/55/L.19, under\r\nagenda item 61, has been circulated this morning.\r\nI should also like to inform Members that next\r\nweek, on Monday, 30 October 2000, document\r\nA/INF/55/3/Add.2, containing a revised tentative\r\nprogramme of work and schedule of plenary meetings\r\nof the General Assembly, will be circulated to\r\ndelegations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n"
