(Finland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 34 (continued) \r\n \r\n \r\nOceans and the law of the sea  \r\n \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/55/61, \r\nA/55/386) \r\n \r\n \r\n  Report on the work of the United Nations \r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea at its first \r\nmeeting (A/55/274) \r\n \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/55/L.10 and Corr. 1, \r\nA/55/L.11) \r\n \r\n The President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 51/204, of 17 December 1996, I \r\ncall on the President of the International Tribunal for \r\nthe Law of the Sea, Mr. Chandrasekhara Rao. \r\n Mr. Rao (International Tribunal for the Law of \r\nthe Sea): It is an honour to address the Millennium \r\nGeneral Assembly in connection with the discussion of \r\nthe item entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”. \r\n I extend to you, Sir, our congratulations on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. \r\n I regret to inform the Assembly of the death, in \r\nBeijing, on 10 October 2000, of Judge Lihai Zhao. \r\nJudge Zhao had been a member of our Tribunal since \r\nOctober 1996. His term was due to expire in September \r\n2002. Steps are being taken to fill the vacancy created \r\nby his death, in accordance with the Statute of the \r\nTribunal. \r\n I am glad to report that the official opening of the \r\nheadquarters building of the Tribunal in the Free and \r\nHanseatic City of Hamburg took place on 3 July 2000 \r\nin the presence of several high dignitaries, including \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations. The Tribunal is grateful to the Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany and the Free and Hanseatic City \r\nof Hamburg for their efforts in erecting the magnificent \r\nnew headquarters building. It is a matter of special \r\nsatisfaction that the Federal Republic of Germany and \r\nthe Tribunal concluded, on 18 October 2000, an \r\nagreement on the occupancy and use of the premises of \r\nthe tribunal. We hope to operate from the new building \r\nvery soon. However, negotiations with regard to the \r\nHeadquarters Agreement have not been concluded. It is \r\nalso our hope that we will soon reach agreement in this \r\nmatter. \r\n During this year the Tribunal heard the Camouco \r\ncase between Panama and France. Panama brought the \r\ncase to the Tribunal on 17 January 2000, and the \r\nTribunal was able to deliver its judgement within a \r\nperiod of three weeks thereafter. This case has once \r\nagain demonstrated the Tribunal’s ability to bring about \r\ndispute settlement without unnecessary delay or \r\nexpense. \r\n Speaking on the occasion of the official opening \r\nof the headquarters building of the Tribunal, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan observed that the Tribunal was \r\n \r\n2  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\n“the keystone” of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, that it was  \r\n“the central forum available — to States, to \r\ncertain international organizations and even to \r\nsome corporations — for resolving disputes about \r\nhow the Convention should be interpreted and \r\napplied” \r\nand that it had  \r\n“already built a reputation among international \r\nlawyers as a modern court that can respond \r\nquickly.” (SG/SM/7477)  \r\nWe are thankful to the Secretary-General for his \r\nsupport for the Tribunal. It is also very encouraging to \r\nnote that the draft resolution under consideration \r\nunderlines the Tribunal’s important role and authority \r\nconcerning the interpretation and application of the \r\nConvention. \r\n I wish to bring to the Assembly’s attention the \r\nfact that under the Convention the Tribunal can offer \r\nflexible mechanisms for the settlement of disputes. \r\nParties may choose between having a dispute heard by \r\nthe full Tribunal, which includes all its judges, and \r\nhaving a dispute heard by one of its special chambers. \r\nThe Tribunal has formed the following special \r\nchambers for dealing with particular categories of \r\ndisputes: the Chamber of Summary Procedure, the \r\nChamber for Fisheries Disputes and the Chamber for \r\nMarine Environment Disputes. It may form other \r\nspecial chambers, depending upon need. \r\n  Mr. Patricio (Mozambique), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n \r\n The Tribunal is also required to form an ad hoc \r\nchamber to deal with particular disputes submitted to \r\nit, if the parties so request. The composition of such an \r\nad hoc chamber is required to be determined by the \r\nTribunal, with the approval of the parties. This option \r\nwould be of particular interest to parties that are \r\nconsidering arbitration. The costs of an ad hoc chamber \r\nare met from the general budget of the Tribunal and are \r\nnot borne by the parties to the case. Parties also have \r\nthe option of choosing ad hoc judges on their behalf. \r\nAnd a judgement given by any of the special chambers \r\nof the Tribunal shall be considered as having been \r\nrendered by the Tribunal. Some States have shown \r\ninterest in ad hoc chambers. \r\n The rule of law in international relations cannot \r\nbe maintained unless international disputes are \r\nresolved by peaceful means. It is equally important that \r\njudgements rendered by international courts or \r\ntribunals be implemented in good faith and in time by \r\nStates and other parties to international adjudication. It \r\nis encouraging to note that the United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration found it appropriate to call \r\nupon Member States of the United Nations to ensure \r\ncompliance with the decisions of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, in compliance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, in cases to which they are parties. This \r\nexhortation is equally relevant in respect of decisions \r\nof all international courts or tribunals, whether within \r\nthe framework of the United Nations system or outside \r\nit. We are very happy to see that the draft resolution \r\nnotes the obligations of parties to cases before a court \r\nor a tribunal referred to in article 287 of the \r\nConvention to ensure prompt compliance with the \r\ndecisions rendered by such court or tribunal. \r\n Not many States parties to the Convention have \r\nfiled declarations as regards choice of compulsory \r\nprocedures for the settlement of disputes under article \r\n287 of the Convention. Only 25 States parties have \r\nfiled such declarations. It is satisfying to note that the \r\ndraft resolution under consideration calls upon States \r\nparties to the Convention to consider making a written \r\ndeclaration choosing from the means for the settlement \r\nof disputes set out in article 287. \r\n The establishment of new tribunals in recent \r\nyears is indeed a positive development, since such \r\nbodies fulfil complementary needs. The United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea offers States a wide \r\nchoice among several procedures for dispute settlement \r\nentailing binding decisions. Those forums are of equal \r\nstanding and effect. The effect of more tribunals being \r\navailable to litigants is that more disputes have come to \r\nbe resolved by parties by means of their choice. There \r\nis also the additional, but in no way less important, \r\nfactor that several of the newly created tribunals are \r\nalso accessible to non-State entities. \r\n The financial situation of the Tribunal remains far \r\nfrom satisfactory. I regret to inform the Assembly that \r\nas many as 35 States parties to the Convention have \r\nnever paid their assessed contributions. Timely \r\npayments of contributions have an important bearing \r\non the ability of our Tribunal to discharge its functions \r\neffectively. I thank the sponsors of the draft resolution \r\nfor inviting the General Assembly to make an appeal to \r\n \r\n 3 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nStates parties to the Convention to pay their assessed \r\ncontributions to the Tribunal in full and on time. \r\n The establishment of trust funds with a view to \r\nproviding financial assistance to States for costs \r\nincurred in connection with disputes before \r\ninternational adjudicative forums is not a new concept. \r\nThe availability of such funds would serve as a device \r\nto overcome financial impediments to the judicial \r\nsettlement of disputes and to promote peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. We welcome in this regard the \r\ndecision of the Tenth Meeting of States Parties to the \r\nConvention to recommend to the General Assembly the \r\nestablishment of a trust fund, to be financed through \r\nvoluntary contributions, for the purpose of providing \r\nfinancial assistance to States in order to help them in \r\nproceedings before our Tribunal. I wish to thank again \r\nthe sponsors of draft resolution A/55/L.10 for inviting \r\nthe Assembly to request the Secretary-General to \r\nestablish such a voluntary fund. I convey my \r\nappreciation also to those delegations that have \r\nannounced contributions to the proposed fund. \r\n There has not been much progress in the matter \r\nof ratification of the Agreement on the Privileges and \r\nImmunities of the Tribunal. Since I addressed the \r\nAssembly on 22 November 1999, only two more States \r\nhave ratified the Agreement, making the total number \r\nof ratifications four. As members are aware, for the \r\nAgreement to enter into force, at least 10 instruments \r\nof ratification or accession need to be deposited with \r\nthe Secretary-General. Here too, we welcome the \r\nprovision of the draft resolution calling upon States \r\nthat have not done so to consider ratifying or acceding \r\nto the Agreement. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/6 of 24 October 1996, \r\nI now call on the Secretary-General of the International \r\nSeabed Authority, Mr. Satya N. Nandan. \r\n Mr. Nandan (International Seabed Authority): I \r\nwish to express the appreciation of the International \r\nSeabed Authority to delegations which have expressed \r\ntheir support for the work of the Authority. I also \r\nexpress appreciation for the various references to the \r\nAuthority in draft resolution A/55/L.10, which is now \r\nbefore the Assembly. In particular, I would like to \r\nemphasize the importance of paragraph 1 of the draft \r\nresolution, which calls upon all States that have not \r\ndone, in order to achieve the goal of universal \r\nparticipation, to become parties to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and to the \r\nAgreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of \r\nthe Convention. In that regard, I would like to note that \r\nthere remain some 35 States which, despite being \r\nparties to the Convention, have not yet completed the \r\nnecessary procedural steps to become parties to the \r\nPart-XI Agreement. Many of them ratified the \r\nConvention before the Agreement was adopted, and it \r\nis therefore necessary for them to complete the internal \r\nprocedures to become parties to the additional \r\nAgreement. \r\n By paragraph 12 of the draft resolution, the \r\nAssembly would welcome the adoption of the \r\nRegulations on Prospecting for Polymetallic Nodules \r\nin the international seabed area. Indeed, the adoption of \r\nthe Regulations by the Assembly of the Authority on \r\n13 July 2000 was the most important legislative \r\nachievement of the Authority to date. The Regulations \r\nelaborate upon and give effect to Annex III of the \r\nConvention and the Agreement for the implementation \r\nof Part XI of the Convention. They provide the \r\nmechanism for implementation of the provisions of \r\nPart XI and Annex III and are therefore a critical \r\nelement of the definitive regime created by the \r\nConvention and the 1994 Agreement. The Regulations \r\nestablish a standard form of contract for exploration for \r\npolymetallic nodules as well as standard terms and \r\nconditions for such contracts.  \r\n Now that the Regulations have been adopted, the \r\nAuthority is in a position to issue the first set of seven \r\nlicences or contracts for exclusive exploration for \r\npolymetallic nodules by seven applicants who were \r\nregistered as pioneer investors by the Preparatory \r\nCommission. The plans of work submitted by the seven \r\nregistered pioneer investors were approved by the \r\nCouncil of the Authority in August 1997, thus bringing \r\nthose investors from the interim regime in resolution II \r\nof the Conference into the definitive regime created by \r\nthe Convention and the 1994 Agreement. The plans of \r\nwork were approved by the Council on the basis that, \r\nas soon as possible following the adoption of the \r\nRegulations, the pioneer investors would enter into \r\ncontracts with the Authority. \r\n I wish to inform the Assembly that, in accordance \r\nwith that understanding, immediately following the \r\nadoption of the Regulations, and given the long delay \r\nin proceeding to the contract stage, I submitted draft \r\ncontracts for exploration to each of the registered \r\npioneer investors and invited them to review the draft \r\n \r\n4  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\ncontracts and to update the programmes of work that \r\nthey had submitted in 1997. It is my hope that these \r\ncontracts can be concluded in the very near future so \r\nthat a report can be made to the next session of the \r\nAuthority on the progress of exploration under the \r\ncontracts. \r\n The final comment I wish to make on draft \r\nresolution A/55/L.10 is in relation to paragraph 14, \r\nwhich calls upon States which have not already done so \r\nto ratify or accede to the Protocol on the Privileges and \r\nImmunities of the Authority. The Protocol is of benefit \r\nto representatives of member States who participate in \r\nmeetings convened by the Authority, as it deals with \r\nthe immunities and privileges of such representatives \r\non their journeys to and from the meetings as well as \r\nwhile they are in the territory of the host country. I \r\nwould urge all member States to consider acceding to \r\nthe Protocol at the earliest opportunity.  \r\n Those who have followed the work of the \r\nAuthority will be aware that in June this year the \r\nAuthority convened the third in its series of \r\ninternational workshops on issues relating to deep \r\nseabed mining. The subject of this year’s workshop \r\nwas mineral resources other than polymetallic nodules, \r\nincluding hydrothermal polymetallic sulphides, cobalt-\r\nrich crusts and gas hydrates. I am very pleased to \r\nreport that the workshop was even more successful \r\nthan the previous workshops, which were on \r\nenvironmental issues associated with exploration and \r\non deep seabed mining technology. A very large \r\nnumber of experts participated in the workshop, along \r\nwith representatives of member States, members of the \r\nLegal and Technical Commission and representatives \r\nof the community of non-governmental organizations. I \r\nbelieve the workshop was extremely useful in \r\nbroadening the international community’s knowledge \r\nof the resources of the deep seabed and in highlighting \r\nthe potential mineral wealth of the oceans. While it is \r\nclear that much work needs to be done to unlock this \r\npotential, it is equally clear that the Authority has an \r\nimportant role to play both as a global repository of \r\ndata and information and as a catalyst for collaborative \r\nresearch at the international level. \r\n The Authority’s next workshop, to be convened in \r\n2001, will deal with the standardization of data \r\ncollection and evaluation of information obtained from \r\nresearch and exploratory activities undertaken in the \r\ndeep seabed, both in respect of mineral resources and \r\nin respect of protection and preservation of the marine \r\nenvironment. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity once again to \r\nurge those member States that have not yet done so to \r\npay their contributions to the administrative budget of \r\nthe Authority in full and on time. I am pleased to say \r\nthat the response to previous requests both by the \r\nAssembly of the Authority and by this Assembly has \r\nbeen encouraging and that the majority of member \r\nStates have fulfilled their obligations promptly. This is \r\nimportant, because it has in turn helped the Authority \r\nto manage its finances in a responsible and efficient \r\nmanner, to the extent that this year I was able to \r\npresent a budget for the financial period 2001-2002 \r\nwhich involved no increase in expenditure in real \r\nterms. I am grateful to all member States for their \r\ncooperation in this regard, and I would once again urge \r\nthose who are in arrears, including former provisional \r\nmembers of the Authority, to pay their outstanding \r\ncontributions in full and as soon as possible to enable \r\nthe Authority to continue its work in an efficient and \r\neffective manner. \r\n I would also like to repeat the call I made during \r\nlast year’s debate for all Member States to consider \r\nseriously their participation in the meetings of the \r\nAuthority. The Convention and the Agreement \r\nestablish a very high threshold for the quorum \r\nnecessary for the convening of the Assembly and the \r\nCouncil; in the case of the Assembly it is half the total \r\nmembership of the Authority. It is apparent, therefore, \r\nthat without the presence of members at the meetings \r\nof the Authority its ability to take decisions will be \r\naffected. For its part, recognizing the burden imposed \r\non Member States, particularly smaller States, of \r\ntravelling to meetings, the Authority has done its best \r\nto streamline the calendar of meetings so that, for \r\nexample, there will be only one two-week meeting in \r\n2001. Accordingly, the seventh session of the Authority \r\nwill be held from 2 to 13 July 2001. \r\n I would like to express appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report, contained in \r\ndocument A/55/61, and to congratulate my friends and \r\ncolleagues in the Division for Ocean Affairs and the \r\nLaw of the Sea on their fine work. As usual, the report \r\nis comprehensive, and, indeed, very useful. \r\n I would like to say a few words about the new \r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process, the first \r\nmeeting of which took place in May 2000. The \r\n \r\n 5 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nInformal Consultative Process was developed, among \r\nother reasons, to provide a more inclusive forum for all \r\nthose interested in oceans and the law of the sea — that \r\nis, States, international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — to freely discuss \r\ndevelopments relating to the oceans in a manner which \r\npromotes an integrated approach to the oceans in the \r\nspirit of the unified and comprehensive nature of the \r\nConvention.  \r\n The process would reinforce the role and \r\nresponsibilities assumed by the General Assembly in \r\nresolution 49/28 as the global institution having the \r\ncompetence to undertake an annual review of overall \r\ndevelopments relating to the oceans and the law of the \r\nsea and would help to avoid a proliferation of forums, \r\nsectoral or otherwise, which would detract from the \r\nresponsibilities of the General Assembly. \r\n I commend the Co-Chairpersons of the Informal \r\nConsultative Process, Neroni Slade of Samoa and \r\nMr. Alan Simcock of the United Kingdom, for their \r\nexcellent work, and to thank them for their report, \r\ncontained in document A/55/274. While I consider that \r\nthe process was extremely useful, I also believe that \r\nsome of the procedures followed might be improved \r\nupon to better achieve the objectives established by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Many important subject areas were addressed in \r\nthe meeting and the discussions were constructive and \r\nwide-ranging. I particularly appreciated the \r\nparticipation of a broad cross-section of representatives \r\nfrom a number of the specialized agencies and other \r\ninternational organizations and bodies, as well as \r\nrepresentatives of the non-governmental organizations. \r\nThe problem, however, is how best to reflect the \r\ndiscussions in a report. The procedure followed at this \r\nfirst meeting seemed to lead to a situation in which the \r\nmeeting as a whole became engaged in the drafting of \r\nthe report. Given the short time available for that \r\nexercise, it necessarily created problems. In the end, \r\nwe were still drafting the Co-Chairperson’s report late \r\ninto the evening, after the interpreters had left.  \r\n While the desire for a perfect report is \r\ncommendable, the procedure was not very helpful. In \r\nthe first place, apart from the cumbersome nature of \r\nthe process, it did not reflect the wide-ranging nature \r\nof the debate and the breadth of the subject matter. \r\nWith so many different views expressed, many parts of \r\nthe report merely reflect the lowest common \r\ndenominator. Perhaps consideration might be given to \r\nstreamlining the procedure and allowing the Co-\r\nChairpersons to produce a summary report on their \r\nown responsibility, with the help of the Secretariat, on \r\nthe basis of the discussion and debate during the week. \r\n This is not an unusual procedure. It was followed \r\nfrom 1983 to 1986 in the Preparatory Commission for \r\nthe International Seabed Authority and for the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and the \r\nsame procedure continues to be followed in the \r\nAssembly and Council of the Authority, where the \r\nChairman’s statement at the end of each session is a \r\nsummary of the discussions and proposals made and \r\nrecords all the important legislative and substantive \r\nissues. The procedure is also followed at the Meetings \r\nof States Parties to the Convention. This approach has \r\nthe merit of saving a lot of time, as well as of \r\nhighlighting the key issues which, in the opinion of the \r\nCo-Chairpersons, might be useful for the consideration \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n I hope that these observations will not be \r\nconstrued in any way as a criticism of the process, \r\nwhich was highly successful. They are intended as a \r\nconstructive contribution to the development of the \r\nprocess, which has already been very useful and \r\nconstructive and which, as most Members know, I \r\nstrongly support. \r\n I would like to comment briefly on draft \r\nresolution A/55/L.11, relating to large-scale pelagic \r\ndrift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones of \r\nnational jurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries by-\r\ncatch and discards, and other developments. There \r\nhave been important developments in fisheries \r\nmanagement practices in recent times. Most fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations predate the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development, Agenda \r\n21 and the Agreement for the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of the 1982 Convention relating to \r\nstraddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, \r\nas well as the 1982 Convention itself. \r\n The evolution in the approach to fisheries \r\nmanagement is reflected in new fisheries arrangements, \r\nin the light of the reality of international fisheries, with \r\ntheir problems of over-capacity and ever-diminishing \r\nfish stocks. It is with great satisfaction, therefore, that I \r\nnote the progress and the status of the United Nations \r\nfish stocks Agreement. With 28 ratifications out of the \r\nrequired 30, we can confidently expect this important \r\n \r\n6  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\ninstrument, which is an essential complement to the \r\n1982 Convention as it relates to the conservation and \r\nmanagement of fisheries resources, to enter into force \r\nin the very near future. \r\n Already the fish stocks Agreement has had a \r\nprofound effect. It has become the reference point for \r\nthe review of fisheries management organizations \r\nworldwide. It has been used as the basis for the \r\nestablishment of at least two important regional \r\nfisheries management organizations — in the western \r\nand central Pacific Ocean and the south-east Atlantic \r\nOcean. It has also been used as the basis for a review \r\nof the structure and mandates of several existing \r\nregional fisheries management organizations, including \r\nsome which were established before the adoption of the \r\n1982 Convention. In this regard, impressive work has \r\nbeen carried out under the auspices of the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly in relation to combating the problem of \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. \r\n I wish to commend the International Tribunal for \r\nthe Law of the Sea for the work it has done over the \r\npast year and for the great contribution it has already \r\nmade to ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the \r\nsystem for the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nestablished under part XV of the Convention. In all of \r\nthe cases it has dealt with so far the Tribunal has \r\nshown an impressive ability to respond quickly to \r\napplications and to bring about dispute settlement \r\nwithout unnecessary delay. \r\n I should also like to add the condolences of the \r\nAuthority to those that have already been expressed on \r\nthe untimely demise of Judge Zhao Lihai. I have \r\nalready sent a message to his family in Beijing.  \r\n May I conclude by taking this opportunity once \r\nagain to thank all of those who spoke earlier in support \r\nof the Authority. I look forward to the continued and \r\nconstructive participation of Member States in the \r\nAuthority’s future work. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.10 and corrigendum 1 and draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.11.  \r\n Before giving the floor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the voting, may I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Uykur (Turkey): With reference to the two \r\ndraft resolutions before us on the agenda item entitled \r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”, Turkey will vote \r\nagainst the one contained in document A/55/L.10. The \r\nreason for my delegation’s negative vote is that some \r\nof the elements contained in the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea that had prevented \r\nTurkey from approving the Convention are retained in \r\nthis draft resolution. \r\n Turkey supports the international efforts to \r\nestablish a regime for the sea that is based on the \r\nprinciple of equity and is acceptable to all States. \r\nHowever, the Convention does not make adequate \r\nprovisions for special geographical situations and, \r\nconsequently, is not able to establish an acceptable \r\nbalance between conflicting interests. \r\n Furthermore, the Convention makes no provision \r\nfor registering reservations on specific clauses. \r\nAlthough we agree with the Convention in its general \r\nintent and most of its provisions, we are unable to \r\nbecome party to it owing to these serious \r\nshortcomings. \r\n This being the case, we cannot support a draft \r\nresolution that calls upon States to become Parties to \r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea and to \r\nharmonize their national legislation with its provisions. \r\n Regarding the draft resolution entitled “Large-\r\nscale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in \r\nzones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas, \r\nfisheries by-catch and discards, and other \r\ndevelopments”, contained in document A/55/L.11, we \r\nwould like to state that we welcome the efforts aimed \r\nat achieving the sustainable use and management of \r\nfisheries, as well as the establishment of regional \r\norganizations and arrangements. \r\n Nevertheless, we are unable to give our consent \r\nto certain elements in the draft resolution, in particular \r\nthe context in which the Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea is referred to. In this respect, we cannot accept the \r\nreference made to the Convention in connection with \r\nthe rights and duties of coastal States in zones under \r\ntheir national jurisdiction, and this reference cannot \r\nhave any effect upon these States’ rights as far as the \r\nquestion of the delimitation of such zones is concerned. \r\nIt is our view that those States, while wishing to \r\n \r\n 7 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nstrengthen the international legal framework for \r\nintergovernmental cooperation, will comply only with \r\nthose international treaties to which they are parties, \r\nand with the principles emanating therefrom; and their \r\nrespective rights will not be affected by any \r\ninternational convention to which they are not parties. \r\n Mr. Albin (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation will vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.10 entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”, as \r\na demonstration of our firm support for the regime set \r\nout in the United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea and to support the efforts of the General \r\nAssembly to promote greater understanding of marine \r\nand ocean issues. \r\n Nevertheless, we wish to formulate one or two \r\ncomments on certain elements contained in the draft \r\nresolution. In operative paragraph 17, we believe that \r\nthe reference to the 10-year time period contained in \r\narticle 4 of annex II to the Convention is, without \r\nprejudice to the decisions adopted in this respect by the \r\nthird meeting of the States Parties to the Convention, \r\nincluding the possibility of reviewing that time period \r\nin light of the circumstances. \r\n We would like to underscore the fact that \r\nestablishment of the voluntary trust funds, referred to \r\nin operative paragraphs 9, 18 and 20 of the draft \r\nresolution, do not affect the possibility of taking up, in \r\nthe meetings of the States Parties to the Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, issues that gave rise to its \r\nestablishment or of analysing a possible modification \r\nof its modalities. \r\n With regard to operative paragraph 41, our \r\nunderstanding is that the organization of the second \r\nmeeting of the Consultative Process on marine science, \r\npiracy and armed robbery at sea will not affect the \r\nrights of States to draw the meeting’s attention to other \r\nissues. \r\n In addition, my delegation will abstain on the \r\nvote on draft resolution A/55/L.11, entitled “Large-\r\nscale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in \r\nzones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas, \r\nfisheries by-catch and discards, and other \r\ndevelopments”. Despite the efforts carried out to \r\nachieve consensus, this draft resolution contains a \r\nseries of elements that prevent my delegation from \r\nsupporting it. We regret the inclusion of the fifth and \r\nsixth preambular paragraphs. We believe inappropriate \r\nthe formulation of value judgements with regard to \r\ninstruments that fall outside the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations and to their relationship to agreements \r\nthat have not yet entered into force. We feel that the \r\nGeneral Assembly is not the appropriate forum for this \r\ntype of statement. \r\n As far as operative paragraph 19 is concerned, \r\nMexico would like to reiterate that all activities \r\nrelating to fisheries should be in accordance with the \r\ninternational instruments that are in force and are \r\napplicable, such as the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea and the Code of Conduct for \r\nResponsible Fisheries. \r\n With regard to operative paragraph 26, we regret \r\nthe inclusion in the title the reference to “illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing”. As the Members \r\nof this Organization are aware, this issue is in the \r\ncourse of discussion in other international forums. The \r\nMexican delegation understands that the treatment of \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing at the next \r\nGeneral Assembly will be limited to an analysis of how \r\nto facilitate and foster the implementation of \r\nagreements that may be reached at the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), \r\nand in no way can the Assembly replace that forum for \r\ndecision-making on substantive aspects of this issue. \r\n Ms. Di Felice (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Venezuelan delegation will abstain in the vote on \r\ndraft resolution A/55/L.10, entitled “Oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea”. In this regard, my delegation would \r\nlike to point out that we have reservations concerning \r\nstatements contained in various parts of the draft, in \r\nparticular in the fourth preambular paragraph and in \r\noperative paragraph 3, relating to the operation of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In \r\nparticular, Venezuela, as a country that is not a Party to \r\nthe Convention, believes that we are not able to accept \r\nor oppose the provisions of the Convention as long as \r\nwe have not explicitly acceded to them. \r\n The Venezuelan delegation supports the \r\ninternational efforts to promote cooperation and \r\ncoordination among all States on matters related to the \r\nocean and the law of the sea. Nevertheless, we must \r\nabstain for the reasons I have just mentioned. \r\n Mr. Alabrune (France) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is honoured to speak on draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.11 on behalf of the Member States of the \r\nEuropean Union, the countries of Central and Eastern \r\nEurope associated with the Union, Bulgaria, Czech \r\n \r\n8  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, \r\nRomania, Slovakia and Slovenia, as well as on behalf \r\nof the associated countries of Cyprus and Malta, and \r\ntwo other States, the Republic of Moldova and \r\nMonaco. \r\n We acknowledge that draft resolution A/55/L.11, \r\nsubmitted under agenda item 34 (b), contains a very \r\ngreat number of useful provisions. It is with regret, \r\ntherefore, that we have decided to request that a vote \r\non the text be taken in the Assembly and that we will \r\nabstain in the vote. \r\n This year we were unable to participate in the \r\nconsensus on the draft resolution, first of all because of \r\nthe reference in the draft to the Framework Agreement \r\nfor the Conservation of Living Marine Resources in \r\nHigh Seas of the South-east Pacific, better known as \r\nthe Galapagos Agreement. This Agreement contains \r\nseveral provisions that cause problems of compatibility \r\nwith the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea. In particular the provisions of the Agreement that \r\nprovide for the possibility of the parties, outside the \r\nlimited circumstances set forth in the Law of the Sea \r\nConvention, to board, inspect and escort ships found \r\non the high seas. \r\n In addition we would like to draw attention to the \r\nimportance we attach to international cooperation for \r\nthe conservation and management of living marine \r\nresources. We are engaged in discussions in several \r\nforums, in particular the Open-Ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans, where we stress the \r\nneed to strengthen the role of regional fisheries \r\norganizations and the need to create new regional \r\norganizations of this kind in order to ensure the \r\nconservation and management of those resources on \r\nthe basis of international law. Furthermore, we actively \r\nsupport all efforts under way at the international level \r\nto combat illegal, unauthorized and unreported fishing. \r\n However, we cannot condone the use of \r\nmisinterpretations of international law in the creation \r\nof regional fishing organizations. In particular, we are \r\nunsure as to the legality of some of these recently \r\ncreated regional fisheries organizations as regards \r\ncertain fundamental principles, such as the equality of \r\nrights and obligations of States on the high seas and the \r\nfact that these organizations must be open to all States \r\nhaving a real interest in fisheries, as well as the \r\nfreedom to fish on the high seas, which comes with the \r\nobligation to cooperate. \r\n Nonetheless, we very much hope that it will be \r\npossible to once again have consensus on this subject \r\nin the future.  \r\n Mr. Vázquez (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ndelegation of Ecuador would like to refer to the draft \r\nresolution contained in document A/55/L.11, entitled \r\n“Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized \r\nfishing in zones of national jurisdiction and on the high \r\nseas, fisheries by-catch and discards, and other \r\ndevelopments”. The delegation of Ecuador would like \r\nto state that we attach great importance to the matters \r\ndealt with in this draft resolution. This draft resolution \r\nestablishes, we feel, an adequate balance between the \r\nvarious different positions of delegations regarding \r\nthese matters. We also feel that this draft resolution \r\nraises various points of interest to developing countries \r\nthat, like Ecuador, are convinced of the need to \r\nstrengthen international cooperation in order to ensure \r\nthe preservation and sustainable use of living marine \r\nresources. \r\n In the draft resolution, among other points of \r\ninterest, note is taken of an important new development \r\nin this area: the adoption of the Framework Agreement \r\nfor the Conservation of Living Marine Resources in \r\nHigh Seas of the South-east Pacific, also known as the \r\nGalapagos Agreement. The central objective of this \r\nagreement is the preservation of living marine \r\nresources by means of international cooperation and in \r\ncomplete conformity with the international law \r\nregarding the sea. \r\n For these reasons, Ecuador will vote in favour of \r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/55/L.11. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the vote. \r\n The Assembly will now take decisions on two \r\ndraft resolutions. We first turn to draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.10 and Corrigendum 1, entitled “Oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea”. \r\n Before proceeding to take action on the draft \r\nresolution, I would like to announce that since the \r\nintroduction of the draft resolution, the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors of draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.10 and Corrigendum 1: Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nAustria, Dominica, Haiti, Jamaica, Kenya, Lebanon, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines, Senegal, Panama and the Bahamas. \r\n A recorded vote has been requested. \r\n \r\n 9 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\n  A recorded vote was taken. \r\n \r\nIn favour: \r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nArgentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahamas,

\r\nAbstaining: \r\nColombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela. \r\n  Draft resolution A/55/L.10 and Corr.1 was \r\nadopted by 143 votes to 2, with 4 abstentions \r\n(resolution 55/7). \r\n \r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Guatemala, \r\nItaly and Saint Kitts and Nevis advised the \r\nSecretariat that they had intended to vote in \r\nfavour.] \r\n The Acting President: We turn next to the draft \r\nresolution A/55/L.11, entitled “Large-scale pelagic \r\ndrift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones of \r\nnational jurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries \r\nby-catch and discards, and other developments”. \r\n Before proceeding to take action on the draft \r\nresolution, I would like to announce that since the \r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors of draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.11: Belize. \r\n A recorded vote has been requested. \r\n  A recorded vote was taken. \r\n \r\nIn favour: \r\nAlgeria, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda,

Tanzania, United States of America, \r\nUruguay, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, \r\nZimbabwe. \r\n \r\n10  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nAbstaining: \r\nAndorra, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, \r\nCyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, \r\nFinland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, \r\nGuinea, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, \r\nKazakhstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein,

\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland. \r\n  Draft resolution A/55/L.11 was adopted \r\nby 103 votes to none, with 44 abstentions \r\n(resolution 55/8). \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in explanation of \r\nvote on the resolution just adopted. May I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n Mr. Maquieira (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ndelegation of Chile, on the occasion of the General \r\nAssembly’s consideration of agenda item 34, “Oceans \r\nand the law of the sea”, would like to state its position \r\nconcerning the resolution just adopted under agenda \r\nitem 34 (b), entitled “Large-scale pelagic drift-net \r\nfishing, unauthorized fishing in zones of national \r\njurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries by-catch and \r\ndiscards, and other developments”. \r\n Our country has traditionally supported this \r\nresolution on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, \r\nbecause of the harmful effects of such fishing on the \r\nliving marine resources in the southern oceans and \r\nseas. Despite its ongoing support for these resolutions \r\nas a whole, in recent years Chile has had some \r\nreservations concerning certain paragraphs of this \r\nresolution which primarily call for endorsement of the \r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\nof 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and \r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, also known as the New York \r\nAgreement. \r\n Chile considers that this Agreement does not \r\nprovide sufficient protection for the interests of the \r\ncoastal State in the contiguous high seas, as set out in \r\narticle 116 of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea and in other provisions of that same \r\nConvention, which would allow interference by third \r\nStates in the exclusive economic zone. Our country has \r\ntherefore opted, for the time being, not to accede to \r\nthis international Agreement. \r\n For these reasons, and on the basis of article 117 \r\nof the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which sets \r\nout, among other things, the duty of all States to \r\ncooperate with each other in taking such measures as \r\nmay be necessary for the conservation of the living \r\nresources of the high seas, Chile has acceded to the \r\nFramework Agreement for the Conservation of Living \r\nMarine Resources in High Seas of the South-east \r\nPacific, also known as the Galápagos Agreement. That \r\nAgreement puts in place mechanisms for coastal States \r\nand high-seas fisheries to establish conservation \r\nsystems for the straddling stocks and highly migratory \r\nspecies found within its scope of application. This \r\nAgreement is fully compatible with the provisions of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nwhich, as the Assembly is aware, imposes an obligation \r\nupon States to cooperate among themselves in the \r\nregulation of high-seas fishing. \r\n For these reasons, our delegation was surprised to \r\nlearn that the European Union had requested that a \r\nrecorded vote be taken on the draft because it wished \r\nto abstain. Its justification for the request was that the \r\nGalápagos Agreement had compatibility problems with \r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea. The parties to \r\nthis Agreement have circulated a statement, which I \r\nwill not delve into now, but I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to invite the European Union to exchange \r\nviews with the States parties to the Galápagos \r\nAgreement on the statements made here this morning. \r\n Mr. Bocalandro (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Argentina would like to comment on \r\ndraft resolution A/55/L.11, which was just adopted and \r\nin whose favour we voted. \r\n The Argentine Republic would like to point out \r\nthat we understand that the expression “other entities”, \r\nwhich appears in operative paragraph 2 of this \r\nresolution, refers to the entities listed in article 305 of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n Mr. Longva (Norway): Norway voted in favour \r\nof the draft resolution contained in document \r\nA/55/L.11. We strongly regret that it was impossible to \r\nadopt that draft by consensus, as has been the case in \r\n \r\n 11 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nprevious years. There are shortcomings and \r\nunsatisfactory elements in the resolution. We agree \r\nwith the European Union that certain provisions of the \r\nFramework Agreement for the Conservation of Living \r\nMarine Resources in High Seas of the South-east \r\nPacific, the so-called Galápagos Agreement, gives rise \r\nto questions of compatibility with the Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea. \r\n In its operative part, the resolution affirms the \r\nneed to strengthen the international legal framework \r\nfor international cooperation in the management of fish \r\nstocks and in combating unauthorized fishing as well \r\nas illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in a \r\nmanner consistent with the Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. \r\n We have consistently advocated that these are \r\nindeed the key instruments of international law in this \r\nfield and we cannot accept agreements or state practice \r\nthat are not compatible with them. Furthermore, we do \r\nnot think that it is sufficient to reduce discards through \r\nthe development and use of selective fishing gear and \r\ntechniques. The practice of discards should be \r\nprohibited, as it has been under Norwegian fisheries \r\nlegislation.  \r\n In our view, however, the positive elements of the \r\nresolution this year outweigh the negative. Notably, \r\nthis year’s resolution not only addresses isolated \r\nproblems that affect the world’s fisheries, but also \r\ntakes a more comprehensive approach in focusing on \r\ninternational cooperation in relevant forums to combat \r\nillegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in general. \r\nMost importantly, the draft resolution contains core \r\nprovisions on the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks \r\nAgreement and affirmations of the central role that \r\nregional and subregional fisheries conservation and \r\nmanagement organizations and arrangements have in \r\nintergovernmental cooperation on the sustainable \r\nmanagement of marine living resources. \r\n As one of the early ratifiers of the 1995 United \r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement, Norway was \r\nparticularly pleased to welcome the conclusion of \r\nsuccessful negotiations on the establishment of new \r\nregional fisheries conservation and management \r\norganizations in the South-East Atlantic and the \r\nWestern and Central Pacific. It was of particular \r\nimportance that these were negotiated in accordance \r\nwith the relevant provisions of the Law of the Sea \r\nConvention and the United Nations Fish Stocks \r\nAgreement. \r\n We sincerely hope that it will be possible to \r\nreturn to consensus on this subject in the future. \r\n Mrs. Álvarez Núñez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Cuba wishes to explain its vote in \r\nfavour of resolution 55/7 on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea. \r\n My country is firmly committed to the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the legal \r\nframework within which all activities related to oceans \r\nand seas should be carried out. The Cuban delegation \r\nregrets that the resolution we have just adopted \r\nincludes inappropriate language in operative paragraph \r\n39, in which the Secretary-General is requested to \r\ncontinue to carry out the responsibilities entrusted to \r\nhim in the Convention and related resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, including resolutions 49/28 and \r\n52/26, to ensure that appropriate resources are made \r\navailable to the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law \r\nof the Sea for the performance of such responsibilities \r\nunder the approved budget for the Organization. \r\n The reference to the financing of activities to be \r\nundertaken by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the \r\nLaw of the Sea runs counter to rule 153 of the General \r\nAssembly’s rules of procedure, which clearly indicates \r\nthe responsibility of the Fifth Committee in approving \r\nresolutions with budgetary implications. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Similarly, operative paragraph 39 of resolution \r\n55/7 ignores the current budgetary procedures, in \r\nparticular the existence of a contingency fund of \r\napproximately $16 million, as noted in part VI of \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 54/251, which was \r\nearmarked precisely for the financing of additional \r\nactivities during the biennium.  \r\n Operative paragraph 39 of resolution 55/7 reflects \r\nattempts to impose a zero-nominal-growth policy on \r\nthe budget of this Organization. This policy has \r\nresulted in the introduction of instability and \r\nunpredictability in the work being done and the \r\nfulfilment of mandates by this Organization. \r\n Mr. Wee (Singapore): Singapore voted in support \r\nof resolution 55/8, because we agree that it contains \r\nmany useful and constructive elements that encourage \r\n \r\n12  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nresponsible fishing practices and sustainable fisheries-\r\nresources management.  \r\n However, Singapore would like to place on \r\nrecord its position on references contained in the \r\nresolution to certain agreements made by some \r\nregional fisheries arrangements. This is because the \r\nlegal implications arising from them are not \r\nsufficiently clear. As we were not privy to the \r\nnegotiations leading to these agreements, we cannot, \r\nwithout closer scrutiny, be in a position to judge what \r\nthe parties intended by specific provisions of such \r\nagreements. \r\n The adoption of resolution 55/8 today must be \r\nwithout prejudice to the requirement that both the \r\nterms of these agreements by regional fisheries \r\narrangements and the way they are implemented must \r\nbe consistent with the applicable principles of \r\ninternational law, in particular the 1982 United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n Mr. Seki (Japan): On resolution 55/8 on fisheries, \r\nwhich we have just adopted, we have all made efforts \r\nto achieve solutions to illegal, unregulated and \r\nunreported fishing, by-catches, discards and other \r\noutstanding problems. Japan agrees with the \r\nconclusions contained in the paragraphs on these \r\nmatters. \r\n However, in the second part of the fifth \r\npreambular paragraph and in other relevant preambular \r\nparagraphs, consensus was not achieved. Japan \r\nappreciates the fact that the Chairman of the informal \r\nnegotiations on this resolution did everything possible \r\nto establish such a consensus, but since that has proved \r\nimpossible at this time, Japan abstained in the voting. \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 34? \r\n  It was so decided. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 177 \r\n \r\n \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization \r\n \r\n \r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/55/433) \r\n \r\n \r\nDraft decision (A/55/L.5) \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to the Executive-\r\nSecretary of the Preparatory Commission for the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization \r\nto introduce his report. \r\n Mr. Hoffmann (Preparatory Commission for the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nOrganization): This is the first occasion on which I \r\nhave had the honour to address the General Assembly \r\nunder the new agenda item “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Preparatory Commission for \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nOrganization”. At the outset, I should like to express \r\nmy appreciation to all Member States for affording me \r\nthis opportunity. \r\n On 10 September 1996 the General Assembly \r\nadopted the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\n(CTBT) by 158 votes to 3 with 5 abstentions. With the \r\nadoption of the CTBT, one of the longest treaty \r\nnegotiations in the history of arms control and \r\ndisarmament was brought to a successful end. \r\n A few months ago, on 15 June, the General \r\nAssembly adopted the Agreement to Regulate the \r\nRelationship between the United Nations and the \r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Article IV of \r\nthe agreement provides that: \r\n “The Commission shall ... keep the United \r\nNations informed of its activities, and may \r\nsubmit through the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations reports thereon on a regular or ad \r\nhoc basis to the principal organs of the United \r\nNations concerned.” (resolution 54/280, annex, \r\narticle IV, para. 1)  \r\n My report on the work of the Preparatory \r\nCommission in 1999 has been circulated by the \r\nSecretary-General in document A/55/433. In my \r\nstatement today I should like to inform the General \r\nAssembly about cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Commission, the Commission’s recent \r\nactivities to prepare for entry into force of the CTBT \r\nand the status of adherence to the Treaty. \r\n With the adoption of the relationship Agreement, \r\nthe Commission became a new member of the United \r\nNations family. Although it remains an autonomous \r\norganization, the Commission wishes to contribute to \r\nthe goals of the United Nations system, the success of \r\n \r\n 13 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nwhich is based on the complementary inputs of its \r\nmany members. In implementation of the relationship \r\nagreement, the Commission will establish a liaison \r\noffice at United Nations Headquarters with effect from \r\ntomorrow. This office will represent the interests of the \r\nCommission in New York and will serve those States \r\nsignatories of the CTBT that are not represented in \r\nVienna. \r\n The relationship Agreement makes provision for \r\nthe use of the United Nations laissez-passer by officials \r\nof the Commission, and we look forward to concluding \r\nthe necessary implementing arrangement for this in the \r\nnear future. In addition, the Agreement provides for \r\nclose cooperation and coordination between the two \r\nOrganizations. The Commission has consequently \r\nexpressed its interest in participating in the work of the \r\nAdministrative Committee on Coordination. An \r\nagreement is also being negotiated with the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), which will \r\nset out a framework for the UNDP to provide \r\noperational support services to the Commission. \r\n The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nbans all nuclear test explosions, for military as well as \r\nfor civilian purposes. It has assumed a pivotal role in \r\nthe nuclear non-proliferation regime. While the \r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its \r\nverification regime address the proliferation of \r\nweapons-grade fissionable material, the CTBT and its \r\nverification regime focus on the prevention of \r\nexplosive testing of nuclear devices. By putting an end \r\nto testing, the CTBT impedes the development of ever \r\nmore sophisticated and qualitatively new nuclear \r\nweapons. The CTBT is expected to stop vertical as \r\nwell as horizontal nuclear proliferation. Thus, the \r\nTreaty strengthens and enhances the process of nuclear \r\ndisarmament. \r\n Successful implementation of the CTBT depends \r\non the effectiveness of its worldwide verification \r\nsystem so that each party can be assured that all other \r\nparties will adhere to the Treaty or at least that any \r\nviolation of it will be detected. The International \r\nMonitoring System (IMS) is a network of 170 \r\nseismological, 60 infrasound, 11 hydroacoustic and 80 \r\nradionuclide stations, supported by 16 radionuclide \r\nlaboratories. It will be capable of registering vibrations \r\nunderground, in the sea and in the air, as well as \r\ndetecting traces of radionuclides released into the \r\natmosphere by a nuclear explosion. The stations will \r\ntransmit a stream of data generated by these four \r\ncomplementary technologies, in near real time, via a \r\nglobal satellite communications system to the \r\nInternational Data Centre in Vienna, where all the data \r\nwill be processed. All data, raw and processed, will be \r\nmade available to States parties for their final analysis. \r\nAmbiguous events will be subject to consultation and \r\nclarification. As a final verification measure, an on-site \r\ninspection may be requested. \r\n The global verification regime of the CTBT has \r\nto be operational at the Treaty’s entry into force. I \r\nshould now like to share with the Assembly what the \r\nProvisional Technical Secretariat has been doing to \r\nassist the Commission in establishing the regime. The \r\nSecretariat started work at the Vienna International \r\nCentre on 17 March 1997 with a very small staff of \r\nnine. After 42 months’ existence, it has become a fully \r\nfledged international secretariat comprising 248 staff \r\nmembers from 70 countries. Since the focus of the \r\nCommission’s responsibilities is technical, the majority \r\nof the staff members in the Professional category are \r\nscientists. \r\n The Secretariat is building up the International \r\nMonitoring System according to a schedule of work \r\ndetermined by the Commission. To date, some \r\n$58 million have been budgeted for capital investment \r\nin the International Monitoring System. This covers the \r\ncosts of site surveys necessary to select the most \r\nappropriate location for each station, the purchase and \r\ninstallation of equipment and the final certification of \r\nfacilities. It represents approximately 40 per cent of the \r\ntotal capital investment required to complete the \r\nInternational Monitoring System. The Division \r\nworking on this system has been working very hard to \r\nlay the groundwork for the network. To date about \r\n60 per cent of the IMS site surveys have been \r\ncompleted, and approximately 20 per cent of the \r\nstations have been installed and are sending data to the \r\nInternational Data Centre. We are also paying special \r\nattention to the certification of IMS stations, and three \r\nIMS seismic stations — in Canada, Norway and the \r\nUnited States — have been certified. \r\n Since 21 February 2000 the International Data \r\nCentre (IDC) has been sending IMS data and its \r\nproducts on a test basis to States signatories. Currently \r\nmore than 40 States have submitted the information \r\nrequired to establish a secure signatory account, and \r\nthey are able to access the data and products. \r\n \r\n14  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\n The core of our Global Communications \r\nInfrastructure (GCI) was put in place in 1999, when \r\nglobal satellite coverage was established with the \r\ninstallation of four GCI hubs and the infrastructure to \r\nlink these hubs to the International Data Centre in \r\nVienna. This year an additional hub was established. \r\nGCI satellite terminals have been installed at 37 IMS \r\nstations, national data centres and development sites. \r\n In the area of on-site inspections, the \r\nCommission has made good progress in the elaboration \r\nof a draft on-site inspection operational manual, which \r\nis being treated as a priority task. Steady progress has \r\nalso been made in the procurement of passive seismic \r\nequipment related to the Seismic Aftershock \r\nMonitoring System (SAMS), as well as of initial items \r\nof handheld low-resolution radionuclide survey \r\nequipment for testing purposes. The Secretariat has \r\nalso initiated the process for the procurement of items \r\nrelated to still and video photography, visual \r\nobservation and position finding. \r\n Confidence-building measures, another element \r\nof the global verification regime, are of a voluntary \r\nnature. The Preparatory Commission has agreed to \r\nestablish a database on chemical explosions for the \r\npurpose of creating the basic technical conditions for \r\nthe implementation of confidence-building measures \r\nafter the Treaty enters into force. \r\n In accordance with article XIV, the Treaty will \r\nenter into force after it has been ratified by the 44 \r\nStates listed in annex 2 to the Treaty. Another \r\nimportant aspect of the Commission’s work is therefore \r\nto promote the signature and ratification of the CTBT. \r\n I am pleased to report that since its opening for \r\nsignature and ratification on 24 September 1996 the \r\nTreaty has been signed by 160 countries. To date, 66 \r\ncountries have also ratified the Treaty; they include 30 \r\nof the 44 States listed in annex 2 to the Treaty whose \r\nratification is needed for it to enter into force. \r\n Following the article XIV Conference convened \r\nby the Secretary-General in October last year — the \r\nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the \r\nCTBT — members of the Preparatory Commission \r\nhave continued to make serious efforts to sustain the \r\nmomentum that the Conference created. To this end, a \r\nwide range of activities, in the form of coordinated and \r\nunilateral initiatives, has been undertaken to advance \r\nthe universality of the Treaty and to promote its early \r\nentry into force. \r\n The commitment of the international community \r\nto bring the Treaty into force was clearly reflected at \r\nthe 2000 NPT Review Conference, which affirmed \r\nsupport for the CTBT and welcomed the final \r\ndeclaration adopted at the article XIV Conference. It is \r\nparticularly significant that the NPT Review \r\nConference agreed on the importance and urgency of \r\nsignature and ratification, without delay and without \r\nconditions, and in accordance with constitutional \r\nprocesses, to achieve the early entry into force of the \r\nCTBT, as well as on a moratorium on nuclear-weapon-\r\ntest explosions or any other nuclear explosions pending \r\nits entry into force. \r\n The recent Millennium Summit, at which \r\nfacilities were made available for States to sign and \r\nratify multilateral treaties deposited with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, provided an excellent opportunity to promote \r\nadherence to the CTBT. I wish to express the \r\nappreciation of the Commission for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative in this regard. During the Summit, \r\nfive States signed the Treaty and two deposited their \r\ninstruments of ratification. \r\n Thus far, the brief history of the CTBT can be \r\nconsidered to be one of success: the international \r\ncommunity firmly supports the Treaty; its Organization \r\nis well established; and even before its entry into force, \r\nthe verification regime has proved itself a reliable and \r\neffective system. The early entry into force of the \r\nTreaty remains an important political challenge. I wish \r\nto take this opportunity to encourage all States to take \r\nthe necessary steps to ensure that the CTBT enters into \r\nforce soon, so that all the components of its \r\nverification regime can be brought into effect to make \r\nour world a safer and more secure place for generations \r\nto come. \r\n The President: I call on the representative of \r\nMexico to introduce the draft decision in document \r\nA/55/L.5. \r\n Mr. Albin (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nMexican delegation has the honour of introducing the \r\ndraft decision in document A/55/L.5, entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization”. \r\n The conclusion of a Treaty completely \r\nprohibiting nuclear tests was for many years a priority \r\nobjective of Mexico’s foreign policy. The Government \r\nof Mexico signed the Treaty convinced that the \r\n \r\n 15 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\ncessation of testing would prevent qualitative \r\nimprovements of nuclear weapons and put an end to \r\nthe development of new types of nuclear weapons. This \r\nis an important step in the process of nuclear \r\ndisarmament. Consistent with the great importance that \r\nMexico attaches to the work of the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), \r\nMexico assumed the chair of the Preparatory \r\nCommission for the CTBTO during the second half of \r\nthis year. \r\n We believe that a closer relationship between the \r\nPreparatory Commission and the United Nations opens \r\nup possibilities of a broad agenda of cooperation. We \r\nmust make the most of them. The active assistance of \r\nthe United Nations will mean that the CTBTO will be \r\nable to carry out its mandate with the greatest \r\nefficiency and transparency. \r\n The Agreement to Regulate the Relationship \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Preparatory \r\nCommission for the CTBTO, approved on 15 June \r\n2000, states that, in accordance with the Charter, the \r\nUnited Nations is the principal Organization dealing \r\nwith matters relating to international peace and \r\nsecurity and acknowledges that the activities of the \r\nCommission performed pursuant to the Treaty will \r\ncontribute to the realization of the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter. \r\n Through this Agreement, the United Nations and \r\nthe Commission recognize the need to collaborate in \r\norder to achieve their common objectives, and, with a \r\nview to facilitating the effective exercise of their \r\nresponsibilities, agree to cooperate closely, consult and \r\nmaintain a close working relationship on matters of \r\nmutual interest and concern. To this end, the United \r\nNations and the Commission have agreed to cooperate \r\nin accordance with the provisions of their respective \r\nconstituent instruments, as underscored by \r\nMr. Wolfgang Hoffmann, Executive Secretary of the \r\nPreparatory Commission, in his valuable presentation. \r\n The Member States of the United Nations must \r\nsupport the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty \r\n(CTBT) as an indispensable element in the framework \r\nsupporting the multilateral nuclear disarmament \r\nagenda. We emphasize that in the Final Document of \r\nthe last Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), \r\nall Member States are urged to continue to make every \r\neffort to ensure the early entry into force of the CTBT. \r\n It is with this in mind that Mexico introduces the \r\ndraft decision contained in document A/55/L.5, \r\nconvinced that greater cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Preparatory Commission for the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization \r\nwill strengthen the United Nations and contribute to \r\nthe objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear \r\ndisarmament. We therefore hope that the draft decision \r\nwill receive the broadest possible support from \r\nMember States and will be adopted without a vote. \r\n Miss Aragon (Philippines): Our travel on the \r\nroad to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\n(CTBT) has been interesting. We have had some bumps \r\nand turns, but we have remained true to our cause. A \r\nwhile back on that road we encountered what seemed \r\nto be an impassable roadblock. But we were able to \r\nprevent the CTBT text from becoming a mere fixture in \r\nthe archives of the Conference on Disarmament and to \r\nbreathe life into this text. In 1996, through the \r\ndetermined efforts of several States led by Australia \r\nand Mexico, the text made the trip from Geneva to \r\nNew York. \r\n In the years that followed, we actively sought to \r\nestablish the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nOrganization (CTBTO), while at the same time trying \r\nto bring universality to the Treaty. While the numbers \r\nhave been encouraging, our efforts at universality had \r\nan extra challenge or another bump in the road — the \r\nratification or accession of the rest of the 45 Annex 2 \r\nStates. But we did go farther down the road when we \r\nmet last year in Vienna for the Conference to facilitate \r\nthe early entry into force of the CTBT. Under the able \r\npresidency of Mr. Masahiko Koumura of Japan, we \r\nreiterated our common commitment and desire to see \r\nthe CTBT enter into force. \r\n The end of the road is still far away, because for \r\nthe Philippines that end is the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons. But more immediately, we must stay \r\non the road towards the entry into force of the CTBT. \r\n We are going in the right direction. This \r\nresolution is proof of that. Other proof is the gentleman \r\nwho has been quietly organizing the CTBTO and who \r\nshared his thoughts with us this morning, Ambassador \r\nWolfgang Hoffmann of Germany. \r\n Even though we have not yet reached that \r\nmilestone when we can celebrate the entry into force of \r\nthe CTBT, today’s decision is important and is one that \r\nI believe will bring us closer to that milestone. \r\n \r\n16  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\n The final nuclear tests of the last millennium \r\nwere all conducted in our part of the world. It is the \r\nhope of my country that these tests were the last for all \r\ntime. \r\n The CTBT is an important part of our collective \r\nefforts to achieve nuclear disarmament. Taken together \r\nwith the other steps we have taken, the CTBT is crucial \r\nin preventing proliferation and will put in place a \r\nverification system that we will one day need when \r\nagreement is finally reached on ridding the world of \r\nnuclear weapons. \r\n Mr. President: I call on the representative of \r\nFrance speaking on behalf of the European Union. \r\n Mr. Bossiere (France) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to address this Assembly on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. The Central and Eastern European \r\ncountries associated with the European Union — \r\nBulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, \r\nLatvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and \r\nSlovenia — and the associated countries Cyprus, Malta \r\nand Turkey, as well as Iceland a European Free Trade \r\nAssociation [EFTA] country that is a member of the \r\nEuropean Economic Area, align themselves with this \r\nstatement. \r\n Allow me first to say how delighted we are at the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the bilateral agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). This \r\ngives the General Assembly an opportunity in plenary \r\nto deal with the progress made on achieving the early \r\nentry into force of the Treaty. \r\n The importance and the urgency of continuing the \r\nprocess of signing and ratifying this Treaty in order to \r\npermit the speedy entry into force of the Treaty was \r\nrecalled in the final document of the Review \r\nConference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). This is a priority of the \r\nEuropean Union. No less than 160 States have signed \r\nthis basic nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation \r\ninstrument. We call upon all States that have not yet \r\ndone so, particularly those that appear on the list of the \r\n44 States whose ratification is necessary for the entry \r\ninto force of the Treaty, to sign and ratify the CTBT as \r\nsoon as possible. In this respect, we congratulate \r\nBangladesh, Chile, Gabon, Iceland, Kiribati, Lithuania, \r\nthe Maldives, Mexico, Morocco, the Russian \r\nFederation, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates on \r\nthe ratification of the Treaty since the last session of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n All the European Union Member States, \r\nincluding those that appear on the list of the 44 States \r\nwhose ratification is necessary for the entry into force \r\nof the Treaty, have signed and ratified the CTBT. The \r\nEuropean Union has spared no effort to ensure the \r\nprompt entry into force of the Treaty and its universal \r\nscope. On 29 July 1999, the European Union adopted a \r\ncommon position in pursuit of these objectives. At the \r\nConference held in Vienna last year, pursuant to article \r\n14 of the CTBT, the countries that had signed and \r\nratified the Treaty reaffirmed their resolve to work to \r\nensure that the Treaty is ratified by all and rapidly \r\nentered into force. \r\n The conclusion of the bilateral agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization will make it \r\npossible for the Secretariat to establish the parameters \r\nof the Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO and to \r\nstrengthen its activities in international forums. I wish \r\nto take this opportunity to express the European \r\nUnion’s hope that the draft agreement with the United \r\nNations Development Programme will also be quickly \r\nconcluded and that a draft will be submitted to the \r\nPreparatory Commission in due course. \r\n The European Union pays tribute to the work \r\ndone by the Executive Secretary and the entire \r\nSecretariat, as well by the Preparatory Commission. \r\nThe European Union particularly acknowledges the \r\nprogress made in installing the monitoring system. We \r\nhope that this momentum will continue and that every \r\neffort will be made to establish the stations. With \r\nrespect to the programme budget, we welcome the \r\ninformation communicated to us by the Executive \r\nSecretary, according to which 91 per cent of \r\ncontributions have already been paid. This confirms the \r\nhigh level of commitment of States. \r\n The European Union hopes that the General \r\nAssembly will fully support the efforts made by the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization \r\nin the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. The \r\nUnion hopes in particular that Member States will \r\nsupport the implementation of the bilateral agreement \r\njust concluded between the United Nations and the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. \r\n Finally, the member States of the Union draw \r\nattention to the fact that they support the initiative to \r\n \r\n 17 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nconvene another conference on article 14 of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in autumn \r\n2001. \r\n Mr. Luck (Australia): Allow me, through you, \r\nMr. President, to extend my delegation’s appreciation \r\nto the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory \r\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty Organization (CTBTO), Mr. Wolfgang \r\nHoffmann, for the report on the activities of the \r\nPreparatory Commission during 1999. We welcome the \r\ncontribution this plenary item makes to a better \r\nunderstanding of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty (CTBT) among all States. \r\n Completion of the CTBT negotiations, in \r\nSeptember 1996, fulfilled a key objective identified by \r\nthe Principles and Objectives of the 1995 Review and \r\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as \r\nbeing important to the full realization and effective \r\nimplementation of article VI of the NPT. \r\n While it is disappointing that the CTBT is not yet \r\nformally in force, it is in provisional operation; and \r\nthat is to be welcomed. With 160 signatories and 66 \r\nratifications, and a growing verification infrastructure, \r\nthe Treaty is firmly established as a powerful \r\ninternational norm against further nuclear testing. I \r\nagree very much with Mr. Hoffmann’s remarks on that \r\npoint. \r\n Australia, which played a major role in bringing \r\nthe Treaty to the United Nations General Assembly in \r\n1996, will continue to work actively with other \r\ncountries to secure early entry into force of the Treaty. \r\nWe recently made a further round of diplomatic \r\nrepresentations to countries of the Asia-Pacific region \r\nand to countries in the group of 44 States whose \r\nratification is required for entry into force. Australia is \r\nalso active in the Vienna process to organize a second \r\nCTBT article XIV conference on facilitating the \r\nTreaty’s early entry into force. We were pleased to take \r\nthe lead in introducing the CTBT draft resolution under \r\nconsideration this year in the First Committee. \r\n Progress in signatures and ratifications has made \r\nan important contribution to maintaining the strength \r\nand momentum of the Treaty. A further key factor has \r\nbeen the successful establishment of the CTBTO’s \r\nPreparatory Commission and its Provisional Technical \r\nSecretariat (PTS) in Vienna. We should be in no doubt \r\nthat the establishment of the Preparatory Commission \r\nwas a landmark achievement for nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament. The setting up of the \r\nPreparatory Commission and the significant financial \r\ninvestment inherent in its work send a powerful \r\nmessage to those still outside the CTBT that the global \r\nnon-testing norm is here to stay. \r\n The Treaty’s International Monitoring System \r\n(IMS) is a major effort for the international \r\ncommunity. When completed it will consist of 170 \r\nseismological, 60 infrasound, 11 hydroacoustic and 80 \r\nradionuclide stations supported by 16 radionuclide \r\nlaboratories. A global communications infrastructure \r\nand an international data centre in Vienna will \r\ncomplete the IMS. Countries will also be establishing \r\ntheir own national data centres to enable them to reach \r\nconclusions about international compliance with the \r\ntest ban. Obviously, this system requires a significant \r\ninvestment, but it is an investment fully justified by the \r\nsecurity benefit of assurance of detection of nuclear-\r\ntest explosions anywhere in the world. \r\n We welcome the good progress made by the \r\nPreparatory Commission and the Provisional Technical \r\nSecretariat on establishing the International Monitoring \r\nSystem, and we look forward to further development of \r\nthis and other aspects of CTBT verification so that the \r\nTreaty’s verification system will be ready at entry into \r\nforce. Obviously, the Preparatory Commission must \r\ncontinue to receive adequate resources in order to be \r\nable to maintain the necessary rate of progress. \r\n Australia will host 21 IMS stations, the third \r\nlargest number of stations in any country. We are \r\npleased to report that work on these stations is at an \r\nadvanced stage, with several stations already close to \r\nbeing certified as meeting CTBT standards. We \r\nencourage all countries hosting International \r\nMonitoring System stations to continue to work closely \r\nwith the Preparatory Commission to ensure timely \r\ncompletion of their stations. Along with the System, \r\nthe possibility of on-site inspections to investigate \r\nserious concerns about non-compliance is a \r\nfundamental element of CTBT verification. Agreement \r\non effective and practical procedures for such \r\ninspections have proven more elusive than we might \r\nhave hoped. We therefore look forward to the active \r\ncontribution of all States signatories in the forthcoming \r\nelaboration process for the on-site inspection manual \r\nso that this document may be ready as soon as possible. \r\n \r\n18  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\n Australia has long recognized that a universal and \r\nverifiable ban on nuclear tests is an essential \r\ncomponent of regional and international peace and \r\nsecurity, and would be a decisive step towards the goal \r\nof the elimination of nuclear weapons. The wide \r\nsupport for the CTBT and the substantial progress \r\nmade on the Treaty’s verification show that a verifiable \r\nnuclear-test ban is now within sight of attainment. We \r\ntake this opportunity to reiterate our appreciation for \r\nthe work of the Preparatory Commission and to assure \r\nit of our continued strong support. \r\n Mr. Smith (United States of America): My \r\ndelegation would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress its support for the important work of the \r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in implementing \r\nthe requirements of the Treaty. The United States has \r\ndemonstrated that support through its active \r\nparticipation in the work of the Preparatory \r\nCommission. \r\n The creation of an international verification \r\nregime, which is the prime task of the Preparatory \r\nCommission, will be a major step forward. That regime \r\nwill include an International Monitoring System \r\nconsisting of a global network of seismological, \r\nradionuclide and infrasound sensors, and an \r\ninternational data centre. It will play a key role in \r\nmonitoring the Treaty. \r\n The United States urges all countries that have \r\nsigned or ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty to meet their obligations to support this effort. \r\n Ms. Schneebauer (Austria): Austria fully \r\nsupports the statement just made by France on behalf \r\nof the European Union.  \r\n I would like to thank Ambassador Hoffmann for \r\nhis excellent report on the cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Preparatory Commission for \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nOrganization. Austria firmly believes that the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is an \r\nimportant instrument in the effort to advance arms \r\ncontrol and nuclear disarmament by banning all \r\nnuclear tests and other nuclear explosions. \r\n We are pleased to note that since the Treaty was \r\nadopted by the General Assembly and opened for \r\nsignature in September 1996, 160 States have signed \r\nand 66 have ratified it. Thirty of those countries are on \r\nthe list of the 44 key States whose ratification is, \r\naccording to article XIV of the CTBT, a prerequisite \r\nfor the Treaty’s entry into force. While we would have \r\nwished the ratification process to proceed more swiftly, \r\nwe must remain realistic and take stock of what has \r\nalready been achieved. We remain confident that in the \r\ncourse of the next month the number of signatory and \r\nratifying States will steadily increase. We especially \r\ncall upon the 14 key States to sign and ratify the Treaty \r\nso that it can enter into force before its fifth \r\nanniversary, in September 2001. \r\n Let me also take this opportunity to express our \r\nhigh appreciation for the work accomplished over the \r\npast three and a half years by the Provisional Technical \r\nSecretariat of the Preparatory Commission, under the \r\nable leadership of the Executive Secretary, \r\nMr. Wolfgang Hoffmann. They are striving hard to set \r\nup the global verification system so that it will be fully \r\nfunctional at the time of the entry into force of the \r\nCTBT. Given the complexity of their tasks, much work \r\nstill needs to be done to meet the requirements of the \r\nTreaty. In view of the remarkable progress achieved, I \r\nam confident that the remaining problems will be \r\nsolved if both the Provisional Technical Secretariat and \r\nthe members of the Preparatory Commission unite their \r\nefforts and their expertise. \r\n Mr. Cheng Jingye (China) (spoke in Chinese): I \r\nwish first of all to thank the Executive Secretary of the \r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), \r\nMr. Wolfgang Hoffmann, for his introduction of the \r\nwork of that organization during the past year. The \r\ninternational community concluded the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) after a great deal of \r\nwork and hard negotiations over many years. The \r\nTreaty constitutes an important step towards the goal of \r\nthe complete prohibition and elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons and is an important achievement in the arms \r\ncontrol and disarmament sphere. It is of epoch-making \r\nsignificance in the process of nuclear disarmament. \r\nSince its adoption, it has been signed by 160 countries \r\nand ratified by more than 60, which shows that the \r\ninternational community supports and trusts the Treaty. \r\n Over the past four years, preparations for the \r\nCTBTO have been proceeding apace, and a great deal \r\nof progress has been achieved. We pay tribute to \r\nMr. Wolfgang Hoffmann, who heads the Provisional \r\nTechnical Secretariat, for the positive contribution he \r\nmade to the Treaty negotiations, and to all others who \r\n \r\n 19 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nare contributing to the work of the Preparatory \r\nCommission. The Commission has been assigned a \r\nnoble task. It is playing an important role in the \r\nstrengthening of international peace and security and in \r\npromoting the process of disarmament. \r\n Enhancing cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the CTBTO will strengthen the \r\nrelationship between the two organizations, in turn \r\nmaking the international community more aware of the \r\nimportance of the CTBTO and thus helping that \r\norganization better to fulfil its historic mission. \r\nAlthough important progress has been made in the \r\npreparatory work, we also note some problems. Some \r\nof the big Powers have refused to ratify the Treaty, \r\nwhich has a serious negative impact on its ultimate \r\nentry into force. There is still room for improvement in \r\nterms of universal participation in the preparatory \r\nprocess. \r\n China has always favoured the complete \r\nprohibition and total elimination of nuclear weapons, \r\nand has always taken a positive approach to the CTBT. \r\nChina was among the first to sign the Treaty and has \r\nplayed an active part in the preparatory work for the \r\nCTBTO. The Chinese Government has submitted the \r\nTreaty to the National People’s Congress for \r\nratification; that body will consider the question of \r\nratification in line with my country’s legal procedures. \r\n We urge countries that have not yet signed or \r\nratified the Treaty to do so at an early date so that the \r\nTreaty can enter into force and can attain universality. \r\nWe also hope that States parties will fully and \r\nfaithfully meet their Treaty obligations so that the aims \r\nof the CTBT can be attained at an early date. \r\n Mr. Cappagli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy thanks go to the Executive Secretary of the \r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), \r\nMr. Wolfgang Hoffmann, for his presentation. \r\n The Argentine Government expresses its \r\nsatisfaction at the Agreement to Regulate the \r\nRelationship between the United Nations and the \r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Argentina \r\nstresses its ongoing active commitment to the \r\ninternational community’s goals of the complete \r\nprohibition of nuclear tests and of the creation of an \r\ninternational verification system through the \r\nInternational Data Centre. In that regard, in December \r\n1999 my country signed an agreement with the \r\nProvisional Technical Secretariat of the Preparatory \r\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty Organization on undertaking activities related to \r\nthe Treaty’s international monitoring facilities. \r\n At the national level, Argentina has contributed to \r\nthe design and installation of monitoring stations as \r\npart of the International Monitoring System. That \r\nreflects our goodwill and our readiness to facilitate the \r\ninstallation of such facilities. \r\n My country stresses its political support for the \r\nentry into force of the Treaty. At the same time, we \r\nexpress our concern about increases in the budget of \r\nthe CTBTO, which entails increased contributions by \r\nevery country.  \r\n We wish to highlight the upcoming regional \r\nworkshop on international cooperation and national \r\nimplementation and ratification procedures, to take \r\nplace at Lima, Peru, from 29 November to 1 December. \r\nIt will provide an opportunity for an analysis of the \r\ninternational monitoring process, and will add further \r\nmomentum towards the entry into force of the Treaty. \r\n Mr. McDougall (Canada): This is a landmark \r\noccasion — the first time an Executive Secretary of the \r\nProvisional Technical Secretariat for the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization \r\n(CTBTO) has appeared before the General Assembly of \r\nthe United Nations. Canada salutes the achievements of \r\nthe organization and the leadership of Wolfgang \r\nHoffmann. We also welcome the growing, mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation between the organization and \r\nthe United Nations system. \r\n The Canadian national statement to the First \r\nCommittee this year noted that the CTBT has now been \r\nsigned by 160 countries and ratified by 63; that there \r\nhas been no testing for over two years; that the \r\nCTBTO’s surveillance and verification network is \r\nunder construction; that there is a de facto moratorium \r\non testing in effect among the five nuclear-weapon \r\nStates that is respected by all of them; and that the \r\npolitical cost of tests, the bar against any further \r\ndemonstrations of weapons capable of human \r\nextinction, is surely higher than it has ever been and is \r\nrising. \r\n Canada wants that political cost to be, and to be \r\nseen to be, simply prohibitive. We want the bar against \r\ntests to be decisive; we want no more tests ever again. \r\n \r\n20  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nThat is why we pressed for the Treaty’s provision for \r\nsustained pressure for ratification, why we will join \r\nnations planning for a second conference, in \r\naccordance with the Treaty, here in New York next \r\nyear, to promote early entry into force, and why we \r\nappeal directly to the 14 Governments whose required \r\nassent for entry into force is still outstanding. \r\n The CTBTO’s verification network heard the last \r\nnuclear tests on earth. It heard the explosions which \r\nsank the Kursk — may the souls of its crew rest in \r\npeace. We should make no mistake: big explosions, \r\nanywhere on earth, are no longer secret. Today’s is a \r\nmonitored moratorium on nuclear tests — something \r\nnew and strong in the world.  \r\n The CTBTO is a vital part of the essential \r\ninfrastructure for a world free from nuclear arms. We \r\nare pleased to have this occasion to hail its progress. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item.  \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft decision \r\nA/55/L.5. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\ndecision A/55/L.5. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft decision A/55/L.5? \r\n The draft decision was adopted. \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 177? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 24 \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference \r\n Report of the Secretary-General (A/55/368) \r\n Draft resolution (A/55/L.17) \r\n The President: I call on the representative of \r\nMalaysia to introduce draft resolution A/55/L.17. \r\n Mr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I wish at the outset to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report. Speaking in \r\nMalaysia’s capacity as the current Chairman of the \r\nIslamic Group at the United Nations in New York, I am \r\npleased to note that the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nthis item indicates a welcome deepening of relations \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nthe Islamic Conference (OIC) through high-level \r\ncontacts, regular consultations and technical meetings.  \r\n The report notes that the OIC has participated \r\nactively in the meetings of the United Nations and its \r\nsubsidiary organs and has entered into cooperation \r\nagreements with various United Nations subsidiary \r\norgans. We are gratified that the Secretary-General \r\nencourages the United Nations and the OIC to continue \r\nto strengthen their cooperation in view of the \r\nincreasingly important role played by the OIC in the \r\ninternational arena, in particular with respect to the \r\nimplementation of the objectives of the United Nations \r\nin the areas of security, disarmament, decolonization, \r\nhuman rights, economic development and technical \r\ncooperation. \r\n The OIC, founded 31 years ago, aims to \r\nstrengthen unity and solidarity among the Islamic \r\ncommunity and to forge greater cooperation among its \r\nmembers, encompassing all areas. The OIC, which \r\ntoday comprises 56 member States and 4 observer \r\nStates, covers a vast geographical area and a large \r\npopulation dispersed over four continents. It represents \r\na rich diversity of cultures and political systems that \r\nshare the common heritage of Islam. With the active \r\nsupport of its members, the Organization has been able \r\nto fulfil its role as an important international institution \r\nserving the cause of global peace and security and \r\nstriving to work for a better future for the Muslim \r\ncommunity and humanity as a whole. \r\n In July this year the twenty-seventh session of the \r\nIslamic Conference of Foreign Ministers (ICFM) was \r\nheld in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The ICFM is the \r\nsecond main policy-making organ of the OIC, the first \r\nbeing the Islamic Summit Conference. The next \r\nsummit meeting will be held in Doha, Qatar, from 12 \r\nto 14 November this year. The foreign ministers \r\nmeeting in Kuala Lumpur considered international \r\ndevelopments and their impact on the Islamic States \r\nwith a view to defining common positions on global \r\npolitical and economic issues. They also reviewed the \r\nsocio-economic situation in the Islamic world, as well \r\nas economic relations with non-member States. They \r\ntook stock of the activities of Islamic institutions set up \r\nto expand economic and commercial cooperation \r\namong member States, and approved joint plans of \r\naction for the progress and social uplift of their \r\npeoples. The Kuala Lumpur meeting also discussed \r\n \r\n 21 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\ncooperation in cultural matters among member States, \r\nwith special attention to the promotion of Islamic \r\ncivilization and culture, as well as to the needs of \r\nIslamic minorities in various parts of the world. \r\nSeveral resolutions were adopted at the Kuala Lumpur \r\nmeeting, representing the positions of the Islamic \r\ncommunity on matters pertaining to global peace and \r\nsecurity, social justice, trade and development. \r\n The foreign ministers also considered, as a major \r\ntheme, the important issue of globalization, particularly \r\nthe continuing unsatisfactory situation with regard to \r\nthe globalization of trade and the crippling debt burden \r\nof the developing countries. They also considered the \r\nsituation in Palestine and the Middle East, Kosovo, \r\nAfghanistan, Kashmir and Somalia, among other areas. \r\nIt took a hard look at the structural distortions and \r\ndiscriminatory treatment that are currently \r\nundermining the international system, and made a \r\nnumber of constructive recommendations. \r\n The OIC Foreign Ministers also meet annually at \r\nthe United Nations in September to coordinate their \r\npositions on various issues on the United Nations \r\nagenda.  \r\n The OIC has amply demonstrated that it is an \r\ninstrument in the service of peace, development and \r\nsolidarity among the world’s peoples. We are gratified \r\nthat the United Nations Secretary-General has \r\nacknowledged the positive role played by the OIC and \r\nhas long considered the Organization to be an \r\nimportant partner of the United Nations. The member \r\nStates of the OIC firmly believe that the United \r\nNations is well-placed to bridge the gap between the \r\nIslamic countries and the rest of the international \r\ncommunity through its mechanisms of dialogue and \r\ncooperation. \r\n Under agenda item, I have the honour, on behalf \r\nof the States members of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.17. The preambular part of the draft resolution \r\nrecalls the previous resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly and recognizes the cooperation between the \r\ntwo organizations, including that initiated by resolution \r\n3369 (XXX) of 10 October 1975, by which the General \r\nAssembly decided to invite the OIC to participate in \r\nthe sessions and the work of the Assembly in the \r\ncapacity of observer. The draft resolution spells out the \r\nreasons for, as well as the benefits of, cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nthe Islamic Conference in their endeavours to pursue \r\ntheir common ideals and goals — namely, the quest for \r\npeace and the promotion of genuine development for \r\nthe benefit of all countries and peoples, as well as the \r\npromotion of human security. \r\n A new preambular paragraph, the ninth, \r\nwelcomes the results of the general meeting of the two \r\norganizations and their relevant agencies, subsidiary \r\norgans, and specialized and affiliated institutions, held \r\nin Vienna from 11 to 13 July 2000, pursuant to \r\nresolution 54/7, adopted last year. \r\n Before elaborating on the operative paragraphs, I \r\nshould like to make the following correction to \r\noperative paragraph 6, where “preventing” in the third \r\nline should be replaced by “preventive”, so that the \r\nphrase will now read “in the field of peace-making and \r\npreventive diplomacy”. \r\n Let me now elaborate on the operative \r\nparagraphs. The draft resolution, inter alia, takes note \r\nwith satisfaction of the report of the Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations; takes note of the conclusions \r\nand recommendations of the meeting of the \r\norganizations and agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem and the OIC and its subsidiary institutions; \r\nnotes with satisfaction the active participation of the \r\nOIC in the work of the United Nations towards the \r\nrealization of the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter; welcomes the strengthening of \r\ncooperation between the two organizations in areas of \r\ncommon concern, including in the field of peace-\r\nmaking and preventive diplomacy, and their close \r\ncooperation in their continuing search for peace and \r\nlasting solution to the conflict in Afghanistan; \r\nwelcomes the increasing information exchange and \r\ncoordination and periodic meetings between their two \r\nSecretaries-General and their officials to deepen \r\nfurther cooperation in priority areas of interest in the \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural fields; \r\nexpresses appreciation to the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his efforts in this regard, and urges the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies to provide \r\nincreased technical and other forms of assistance to the \r\nOIC and its subsidiary agencies; and requests the \r\nSecretary-General to report to the General Assembly at \r\nits fifty-sixth session on the state of cooperation \r\nbetween the two organizations. \r\n I trust that the Assembly will fully support draft \r\nresolution A/55/L.17, which I submit on behalf of the \r\n \r\n22  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nOIC member States for the Assembly’s consideration \r\nand unanimous adoption. \r\n Mr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): \r\nConsideration of the agenda item entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nthe Islamic Conference” is of special importance for \r\nmy delegation, since it is a high point in our dialogue \r\nto define the framework of a mutually advantageous \r\npartnership in order to find the right collective \r\nresponses to the many challenges facing both \r\norganizations. \r\n The Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\n(OIC) comprises some 50 member States, representing \r\na fifth of the world’s population, and this near-\r\nuniversality gives the OIC global duties and \r\nobligations. It is therefore natural that it shares the \r\npurposes and principles, as well as the concerns, of the \r\nUnited Nations, which explains the importance that the \r\nStates members of the OIC, which are also Members of \r\nthe United Nations, attach to strengthening, expanding \r\nand deepening cooperation between the two \r\norganizations. Over the years this cooperation has \r\nreached the point of becoming a living reality \r\nencompassing complementary activities in our quest \r\nfor solutions to crises and conflicts that beset the \r\nIslamic Ummah in broad areas, such as development, \r\nthe environment, refugees and the dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. \r\n One priority of the OIC, clearly, is to find \r\nsolutions to crises that beset certain countries or \r\nregions and are of great concern to the international \r\ncommunity. Whether the crisis concerns the problem of \r\nthe Middle East, and more specifically the question of \r\nPalestine, which was the reason for the creation of the \r\nOIC, or the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nKosovo, Somalia, Jammu and Kashmir, Afghanistan or \r\nSierra Leone, the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference is deeply committed to finding a lasting \r\npolitical solution, working hand in hand with the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Among these crises, the question of Palestine is \r\ntoday of the highest priority. My country, Senegal, \r\nwhich holds the chairmanship of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, and which is also a member of the Special \r\nCommittee to Investigate Israeli Practices in the \r\nOccupied Arab Territories, can attest to the vitality of \r\nthe relationship and the pre-eminent role of the OIC \r\nand the United Nations in finding a satisfactory \r\nsolution to this central question of the Israeli-Arab \r\nconflict. \r\n Recently, following the provocative visit paid to \r\nthe Al-Haram Al-Sharif sanctuary by Mr. Ariel Sharon, \r\nthe head of the Likud Party, and following the deadly \r\nviolence that this visit triggered in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, both organizations worked in \r\nclose cooperation to resume the tenth emergency \r\nspecial session in order to explore and implement ways \r\nto reduce tension and put the peace process back on \r\ntrack. \r\n The Special Committee on Palestine, which I \r\nchair, has also reacted to these events by adopting, at \r\nthe meeting held on 10 October, a declaration that \r\nreaffirmed the ongoing responsibility of the United \r\nNations for all aspects of the settlement of the question \r\nof Palestine, including Jerusalem, in accordance with \r\nthe agreements, the relevant resolutions and \r\ninternational law. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) extends \r\nalso to the promotion of international peace and \r\nsecurity in conflict zones, particularly in Afghanistan, \r\nSomalia, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Jammu and Kashmir and, more recently, \r\nin Kosovo and Sierra Leone. In these various crises, \r\nthe member States of the OIC have associated their \r\ninitiatives with those of the United Nations in order to \r\nrestore peace, provide humanitarian assistance and help \r\nin the post-conflict peace-building. \r\n It is within the context of this cooperation that the \r\ntwo organizations continue above all to harmonize \r\ntheir activities so as to implement the 10 priorities \r\ndefined by the recent general meeting of \r\nrepresentatives of the secretariats of United Nations \r\nand OIC bodies and agencies. This meeting was held in \r\nVienna from 11 to 13 July 2000, pursuant to Assembly \r\nresolution 54/7. These priorities include science and \r\ntechnology, trade and development, assistance to \r\nrefugees, food security and agriculture, education, \r\nhuman resources, the environment, health and \r\npopulation. This expanded, multiform and diversified \r\ncooperation might even provide a model for the \r\nexpansion of relations between the United Nations and \r\nother organizations. \r\n I remain convinced that following the ninth \r\nsummit of the OIC to be held next month in the \r\n \r\n 23 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nfraternal country of Qatar, cooperation between the \r\nOIC and the United Nations will make further \r\nprogress, in an international context in which both of \r\nthese international organizations will be increasingly \r\ncalled upon to promote the well-being of the peoples of \r\ntheir member States. \r\n In conclusion I wish to stress that today’s world \r\nis facing many serious challenges, and, in order to \r\naddress them, the resolve and combined efforts of the \r\nvarious actors in international affairs are required. \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the OIC \r\nis definitely one way of meeting those challenges and \r\nof establishing the bases for peace and development in \r\nthe world. \r\n For these reasons, my delegation calls for the \r\nadoption, by consensus, of draft resolution A/55/L.17 \r\nthat is before us. \r\n I cannot conclude this statement without \r\nconveying heartfelt congratulations to my brother, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mokhtar Lamani, for the outstanding \r\nwork he does to strengthen cooperation between the \r\nOIC and the United Nations, for the pre-eminent role \r\nhe plays and for the devotion he has shown to the \r\nIslamic Ummah. \r\n Mr. Al-Heid (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nToday we are discussing the agenda item on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). The \r\nreport of the Secretary-General contained in document \r\nA/55/368, which is before us, sheds light on the \r\ncooperation between the two organizations. In this \r\ncontext I would like to extend my profound gratitude to \r\nHis Excellency, the Secretary-General, for his report. \r\n The developments that have taken place in the \r\narea of cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOIC at various levels during the past period, as \r\nreviewed by the Secretary-General’s report, confirm \r\nthe belief of the representatives of the two \r\norganizations in the scope of their cooperation, their \r\ncommitment to international and regional causes and \r\ntheir shouldering of responsibilities. The Government \r\nof Saudi Arabia welcomes the continuing consultations \r\nbetween the representatives of the United Nations and \r\nthe OIC. Carried out through the meetings of the \r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the OIC, \r\nthese consultations review all matters of great \r\nimportance in the political, economic and cultural \r\nfields and all matters of great interest to the member \r\nStates of the two organizations. In addition, we believe \r\nthat the various mechanisms for these consultations are \r\nthe right channels for conveying the concerns of the \r\nmember States of the OIC, so as to find solutions to \r\ncommon issues such as peace, disarmament, self-\r\ndetermination, the question of Palestine, the questions \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan and \r\nSomalia, and other issues relating to global peace and \r\nsecurity that require intensifying the efforts of the two \r\norganizations, on the one hand, and those of the \r\ninternational community on the other. \r\n While cooperation is important in the political \r\nfield, it is also important in the fields of social and \r\neconomic development. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral reviews the meetings of the United Nations \r\nand the OIC and provides a summary of the \r\nparticipation that the OIC would like to see from the \r\nvarious organizations in the United Nations system, in \r\nparticular from the United Nations main specialized \r\nagencies. In order to guarantee that the peoples of the \r\nmember States of the OIC reach a technical level that \r\nallows them to keep up with recent developments while \r\nremaining true to the tolerant teachings of Islam, the \r\nOIC wishes to increase this cooperation, particularly in \r\nthe fields of agriculture, industry, finance and scientific \r\nand technical know-how. \r\n In this context I would like to pay tribute to the \r\nconstructive role that member States of the OIC have \r\nplayed in the efforts to increase and develop \r\ncooperation among them, in order to make further \r\nprogress in development and to establish a more just \r\neconomic system. In addition, these member States \r\nhave made a special effort to exchange experiences and \r\ncoordinate their positions so as to achieve the main \r\ngoals of peace, security and justice, in accordance with \r\nthe United Nations Charter. \r\n In conclusion my delegation would like to launch \r\nan appeal to the host country to take a positive \r\napproach and treat the mission of the OIC in New York \r\non the same and equal footing as other observer \r\nmissions, so that it may carry out its work of increasing \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and other \r\nregional organizations. \r\n Mr. Ahmad (Pakistan): The General Assembly is \r\ntoday reviewing the report of the Secretary-General on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in \r\n \r\n24  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\npromoting their shared goals of international peace, \r\nsecurity and development. \r\n We note with satisfaction that the United Nations \r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference have \r\nmaintained close coordination during the past year on \r\nimportant political issues, including the question of the \r\nMiddle East and of Palestine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nthe situation in Jammu and Kashmir, the situation in \r\nAfghanistan, Somalia and the situation relating to \r\nNagorny Karabakh. \r\n Periodic dialogue at the level of the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the two organizations on peacemaking \r\nefforts in the Middle East, Kosovo and the Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia is an important step forward.  \r\n On Afghanistan, joint initiatives by the United \r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference have been extremely useful in promoting \r\nthe prospects of a lasting solution to the conflict. \r\nCooperation on this issue must be further strengthened. \r\n There is now a need for sustained and effective \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference towards \r\nresolving some of the most protracted conflicts. The \r\nJammu and Kashmir dispute between India and \r\nPakistan is one of them. Unfortunately, no progress has \r\nbeen registered on this issue despite the fact that it \r\nremains on the agendas of both organizations and has \r\nthe potential of endangering global peace and security. \r\n It is a matter of satisfaction that cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations system and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference is expanding \r\non a wide range of socio-economic issues. These \r\ninclude science and technology, trade and \r\ndevelopment, technical cooperation among Islamic \r\ncountries, assistance to refugees, food security and \r\nagriculture, education and eradication of illiteracy, \r\ninvestment mechanisms and joint ventures, human \r\nresource development, environment, health and \r\npopulation, and development of arts and crafts and \r\npromotion of heritage. Efforts should be made to \r\ndiversify cooperation in these and other related fields \r\nfor the collective benefit of the Member States. \r\n In our statements on the subject during the last \r\ntwo years, we have been expressing concern over the \r\nfact that the Permanent Observer Mission of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, which has \r\nbeen functioning in New York for more than two \r\ndecades, has not been accorded formal recognition by \r\nthe host Government. Despite the concerns expressed \r\nby a large number of delegations, very little progress \r\nhas been achieved in this regard, which hampers the \r\norganization’s effective functioning, which includes \r\nmatters pertaining to cooperation and coordination \r\nwith the United Nations and its agencies. We once \r\nagain urge the host Government to accord the OIC \r\nObserver Mission the necessary privileges and \r\nimmunities, as envisaged in Article 105 of the United \r\nNations Charter and the relevant provisions of the \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters Agreement with the host \r\ncountry. This need has been recognized by the \r\nGovernment of Switzerland, as it has accorded the \r\nnecessary privileges and immunities to the OIC \r\nObserver Mission in Geneva, facilitating its interaction \r\nwith the United Nations and the specialized agencies \r\nbased in that country. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express our \r\nconfidence that cooperation between the United \r\nNations system and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference will continue to grow in the years ahead. \r\nFor its part, Pakistan will continue to contribute \r\ntowards promoting greater cooperation and \r\ncoordination between these two organizations. \r\n Mr. Kolby (Norway): At the outset, I would like \r\nto commend the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations and the Chairman of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference (OIC) for their commitment to the \r\ncooperation between the two organizations and their \r\nefforts to extend it to new fields of common interest. \r\nWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIC. \r\n As the problems that we all must confront have \r\nbecome more global, the importance of multilateral \r\nnegotiations and agreements has increased. This is also \r\nthe case for the role of regional organizations. Norway \r\nbelieves that these organizations constitute an \r\nimportant tool for promoting the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. We consider the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference a vital partner for the United \r\nNations because of its broad regional influence. We \r\nalso recognize that the importance of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nthe Islamic Conference reaches far beyond the Islamic \r\nworld. \r\n Norway fully supports the cooperation between \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the \r\n \r\n 25 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\nUnited Nations in their common search for solutions to \r\nglobal problems related to international peace and \r\nsecurity, disarmament, self-determination, \r\ndecolonization, fundamental human rights and \r\neconomic, social and technical development. \r\n We welcome the increasing efforts being made by \r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference to promote international peace and \r\nsecurity. Noting the positive developments in the \r\nMaghreb, we encourage the two organizations to \r\ncontinue strengthening cooperation in the field of \r\npeacemaking and preventive diplomacy. The periodic \r\nhigh-level meetings between the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations and the Chairman of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, and the \r\nregular contact, at the level of the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs and the Permanent Observer Mission \r\nof the OIC to the United Nations, are important in this \r\nregard. \r\n We particularly encourage the United Nations and \r\nthe OIC to renew their efforts to seek a negotiated \r\nsolution to the conflict in Afghanistan. Two rounds of \r\nindirect talks with the United Front and the Taliban \r\nwere convened earlier this year by the OIC’s \r\nCommittee for Afghanistan. They were chaired by the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran and were a commendable \r\ninitiative. Those meetings, held in Jeddah at the \r\nheadquarters of the OIC, constitute an important \r\ncontribution to the work for peace and stability in the \r\nregion. \r\n Norway also encourages cooperation between the \r\nOIC and the United Nations in the Balkans. \r\n Cooperation between specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations and the OIC and its subsidiary bodies \r\nand specialized and affiliated institutions serves to \r\nextend dialogue to new areas. We are pleased to note \r\nthat a general meeting on cooperation between \r\nrepresentatives of the secretariats of the United Nations \r\nsystem and the OIC and its specialized institutions was \r\nheld in Vienna in July of this year. This meeting also \r\nconsidered proposals for enhancing the mechanisms of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations system and \r\nOIC and its institutions. We note that there are \r\ncooperation and information exchanges between \r\nUnited Nations agencies, such as the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the \r\nInternational Labour Organization and the World \r\nHealth Organization, and the OIC with a view to \r\nenhancing social and economic development. \r\n The memorandum of understanding signed by the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund and the OIC on 2 \r\nOctober 1998 constituted an important follow-up to the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment in Cairo. We welcome the steps taken \r\ntowards further implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction, especially with regard to Islam and \r\nreproductive health, Islam and the status of women, \r\nand Islam and population and development. \r\n Norway notes with appreciation that agencies of \r\nthe United Nations, such as the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and \r\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees, are working \r\ntogether with the OIC in areas of common interest. We \r\nare also aware of the cooperation between the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the \r\nOIC. We encourage such dialogues. \r\n The Islamic commentaries on the Universal \r\nDeclaration are a valuable contribution to a mutual \r\nunderstanding of our joint commitment. Let me also \r\ntake this opportunity not just to stress the importance \r\nof freedom of religion and belief, but also to highlight \r\nthe role that religious communities can play — also at \r\nthe non-governmental level — in seeking solutions to \r\nconflict. The Oslo Coalition, established in accordance \r\nwith the mandate of the Oslo Conference on Freedom \r\nof Religion and Belief, is working together with \r\nreligious and confessional groups to pursue this \r\nagenda. \r\n Let me call attention to two further issues: \r\nwomen’s rights and the right to education. As Norway \r\nstated at the Cairo Conference, women’s education is \r\nthe single most important path to higher economic \r\ngrowth and lower infant mortality. We are pleased to \r\nnote that the education of girls and women is now \r\nincluded in the cooperation programmes between a \r\nlarge number of United Nations and OIC institutions \r\nand agencies. \r\n In closing, Norway wishes again to express its \r\nappreciation for the commitment of the United Nations \r\nand the OIC in developing the cooperation between the \r\ntwo organizations. We hope that this working \r\nrelationship will be developed further in the years to \r\ncome. \r\n \r\n26  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\n Mr. Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran): At \r\nthe outset, allow me to convey my delegation’s \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the \r\ncomprehensive and informative report entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference”, contained in \r\ndocument A/55/368. \r\n This report gives evidence that, during the past \r\ndecade, the process of consultation and cooperation \r\nbetween the two organizations in their common search \r\nfor solutions to world crises in various areas — \r\ninternational peace and security, peacemaking efforts, \r\ndisarmament, self-determination and fundamental \r\nhuman rights — has been constantly strengthened. \r\n Among major issues of mutual concern to the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the \r\nUnited Nations, the following, for my delegation, stand \r\nout most prominently and I would like to touch upon \r\nthem.  \r\n War and fratricide in Afghanistan have persisted \r\nfor more than two decades. The Islamic Republic of \r\nIran has suffered more than any other country from the \r\nadverse consequences of chaos and instability in \r\nAfghanistan. Obviously, a joint effort aimed at \r\nresolving the continued crisis in Afghanistan is one of \r\nthe priorities of the OIC that also figures notably on \r\nthe agenda of the United Nations.  \r\n In this respect, the initiative of the Chairman of \r\nthe eighth OIC Summit, President Khatami of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, in bringing warring Afghan \r\nparties to the negotiating table, has provided yet \r\nanother opportunity to both organizations to act jointly \r\nwith a view to putting an end to the protracted conflict \r\nin Afghanistan. The OIC Committee for Afghanistan, \r\nin a meeting with the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations in March 2000, emphasized, among other \r\nthings, the central role of the United Nations in dealing \r\nwith the Afghan crisis and the need for the OIC to play \r\na complementary role in an effort to use, in an efficient \r\nmanner, the potentials of the Islamic world in order to \r\nend the sufferings of the Afghan people. Authorized by \r\nthe Secretary-General, his Personal Representative \r\nplayed an active role in conducting the first and second \r\nround of negotiations between the two Afghan parties \r\nat Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We hope that the continuation \r\nof close cooperation and coordination, worked out \r\nbetween the two Organizations, results in bringing \r\nabout peace in Afghanistan.  \r\n The OIC has played a major role in promoting the \r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. \r\nThe draft global agenda on dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, which was adopted by the twenty-seventh \r\nsession of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers, \r\nheld in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in June 2000, provides \r\na propitious basis for the OIC member States to begin \r\nnegotiating with other groups within the United \r\nNations in order to facilitate its adoption next year. \r\nMeanwhile, the OIC ad hoc committee on dialogue \r\namong civilizations, chaired by the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, held two meetings at United Nations headquarters \r\non 19 September and 17 October 2000. The ad hoc \r\ncommittee also assisted in developing the draft \r\nresolution on the United Nations Year of Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations. The consideration of this draft \r\nresolution by the General Assembly is scheduled for 13 \r\nNovember 2000. \r\n The question of stability and peace in the Middle \r\nEast through full restoration of the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, including the rights of self-\r\ndetermination, return of refugees to their homes and \r\nthe establishment of a sovereign State of Palestine, is \r\nstill a matter of high priority and major concern on the \r\nagendas of both organizations. In this regard, my \r\nGovernment strongly believes that the continuing \r\nconsultations and cooperation between the two \r\norganizations could contribute to the full realization of \r\nthe Palestinians’ rights and the restoration of a just and \r\ngenuine peace and long-lasting security in the region. \r\n Fortunately, during the past two years, new \r\navenues for a better and strengthened cooperation \r\nbetween the OIC and the United Nations system have \r\nbeen explored. Significant progress in this field has \r\nbeen made through widespread cooperation between \r\nthe OIC and its subsidiary bodies and the United \r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization (UNESCO). The two organizations have \r\njointly planned, financed and implemented activities in \r\nthe eradication of poverty, basic education — \r\nespecially girl’s education — capacity-building in the \r\nfield of information, communications technology and \r\ncultural heritage. UNESCO and the OIC are preparing \r\njointly to organize the United Nations Year of Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations and the issue of cultural dialogue \r\nin the year 2001. My delegation looks forward to the \r\nsame achievements in cooperation between the OIC \r\nand the other pertinent specialized agencies, \r\n \r\n 27 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\norganizations, programmes and departments of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Undoubtedly, the issues of common interest to the \r\ntwo organizations could not be confined to what I have \r\nattempted to elaborate here. There exist more areas of \r\ncommon interest that need to be further developed. We \r\nare confident that draft resolution A/55/L.17, \r\nintroduced by the Ambassador of Malaysia, serves as \r\nanother basis for promoting in the coming year joint \r\nactivities which fall within the common purpose of \r\nboth organizations, whose goals are to ensure \r\ninternational cooperation in seeking solutions to \r\ninternational economic, social, cultural and \r\nhumanitarian problems. \r\n In the last month of the three-year tenure of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran as the Chair of the Eighth \r\nSummit of the OIC, I would like to express my \r\ncountry’s deep gratitude and appreciation to both the \r\nSecretariat of the United Nations and the Permanent \r\nObserver Mission of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference to the United Nations, particularly \r\nAmbassador Lamani, for their tireless efforts and the \r\ncommendable job they did in close cooperation and \r\ncoordination with my delegation, as well as holding \r\nvarious meetings of the OIC. \r\n Mr. Alkhal (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me \r\npleasure to address the General Assembly on agenda \r\nitem 24, “Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference”. I wish to \r\nthank you, Sir, for guiding the work of the Assembly \r\nably and with diplomatic tact. \r\n It has been proved that cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations is of great \r\nimportance in international affairs. Since its creation \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has \r\nbeen an important and irreplaceable forum for \r\ncooperation and solidarity among its member States. \r\nWe are convinced that the OIC will gain an effective \r\nrole in international affairs with time.  \r\n The OIC is one of the largest regional \r\norganizations which can contribute to the work of the \r\nUnited Nations and can play an effective role in the \r\npolitical, economic, social, cultural and technical \r\nfields. International problems that are of interest to the \r\ntwo organizations, such as international peace and \r\nsecurity, disarmament, the right to self-determination, \r\ndecolonization, basic human rights and economic and \r\ntechnological development, are all areas in which both \r\norganizations can make progress. Among its members, \r\nthe OIC has many people living in various continents \r\nof the world within an enormous geographical area. \r\nThe common denominator among its members is \r\nculture, heritage and common interests. Our \r\norganization now has great political expertise due to \r\nthe diversity of our culture and the heritage of our \r\nmembership. That is why our organization could be an \r\nimportant and effective instrument for peace, stability \r\nand security throughout the world. \r\n On 10 October 1975 the United Nations decided \r\nto invite the OIC to participate as an observer in its \r\nsessions and in its subsidiary bodies. That is why the \r\nagenda item now before us for consideration was \r\nincluded for the first time on the agenda of the thirty-\r\nfifth General Assembly session in 1980. Given the \r\nimportance of this cooperation, the General Assembly \r\nconsidered this item and has done so every session \r\nsince then. This attests to the benefit of this \r\ncooperation for us all in order to try to attain our \r\ncommon ideals and principles: to see a better world; \r\nbuild economic development among all peoples of the \r\nworld; provide for collective security and strengthen \r\nthis security; and try to implement Chapter VIII of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, which deals with the role of \r\nregional organizations in the area of international peace \r\nand security and stability. \r\n I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on this item, in which he encourages the OIC \r\nto continue its cooperation with the United Nations in \r\ninternational affairs. To make this cooperation \r\nconsistent and effective, Qatar welcomes periodic \r\nhigh-level contacts between the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations and the Secretary General of the \r\nOIC. We also welcome bilateral contacts between the \r\ntwo organizations at all levels. I do not need to provide \r\nfurther clarifications about this aspect — my \r\ndelegation is convinced that the General Assembly will \r\nbe able to give total support to the draft resolution on \r\nthis item. I appeal to Member States of the United \r\nNations to adopt it by consensus as proof of solidarity \r\nwith the Muslim world. \r\n It gives me pleasure to recall that Qatar will be \r\nhosting the Ninth Islamic Summit, in Doha from 12 to \r\n14 November 2000. We take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome to the Presidents of the Islamic States in their \r\nsecond homeland. We are convinced of the increasing \r\nrole that can be played by our Islamic organization in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations in order to \r\n \r\n28  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nimplement resolutions on peace and security and \r\ndevelopment, and to find solutions for problems in \r\nAsia and Africa, including the problem of Afghanistan, \r\nthat could benefit from our presence. May God guide \r\nus at that Conference to give impetus to our joint \r\nIslamic endeavours to resolve problems such as that of \r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif, which at present threatens world \r\npeace and security. \r\n Mr. Patricio (Mozambique), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Mr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): We welcome the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. We find the report comprehensive and \r\nstructured to reflect the essence of the cooperation \r\nbetween the two organizations. \r\n The Bangladesh delegation fully supports the \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). We are \r\nencouraged to see that it has grown from strength to \r\nstrength and expanded into the vital areas of \r\npeacemaking and conflict resolution, as well as being \r\nin the realms of crucial issues of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. We are particularly happy that the rich \r\nexperience of the United Nations has been employed in \r\nthe common search for solutions to global problems. \r\n Bangladesh strongly believes that peace and \r\ndevelopment should go hand in hand. Today, conflict \r\nresolution is increasingly approached through \r\ncooperation with organizations that are relevant and \r\nhold important stakes at both the international and \r\nregional levels. We are enthused by the ongoing \r\nconsultations between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on \r\npeacemaking efforts relating to the situation in \r\nAfghanistan, the Middle East, Kosovo and the Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. The visible role of this \r\ncooperation in Afghanistan is to our satisfaction and \r\nwe sincerely wish it success. \r\n We are happy to endorse the agreement on the 10 \r\npriority areas of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the OIC and its specialized institutions. \r\nThe setting up of joint working groups is the \r\nappropriate way to discuss the issues, and we are \r\nheartened to note that the general meeting of the \r\nUnited Nations system and the OIC and their \r\nspecialized institutions have succeeded in reaching \r\nagreement on wide-ranging programmes of cooperative \r\nactivities for the period 2000 and 2001. We would \r\nappreciate it if a full progress report on these \r\nprogramme activities could be prepared for our \r\nconsideration in future. We wish to underscore that, as \r\na guiding principle, such programmes should be drawn \r\nup in a way that they benefit the highest number of \r\npeople of the OIC countries. \r\n While we support the cooperative activities in all \r\nthe identified areas, we would like to limit our \r\ncomments to only a few.  \r\n International trade remains an important engine \r\nof growth in the age of globalization. We believe that \r\nexpanding trading opportunities through increased \r\nmarket access for export of goods from developing \r\ncountries and improving their supply capacity are \r\nimportant areas for consideration in sectoral meetings \r\nin priority areas of cooperation. \r\n Bangladesh believes that capacity-building in \r\nscience and technology in developing countries should \r\ncontinue to be a priority issue. In this regard, we note \r\nwith satisfaction the identified programmes in the \r\ncommon sphere of activities of the United Nations \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and \r\nthe Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization (ISESCO). We would like to emphasize \r\nthe vast scope for expansion of scientific and \r\ntechnological cooperation among the OIC member \r\nStates, which may be taken into account while \r\nelaborating projects in future. \r\n We also recognize the growing scope of technical \r\ncooperation among the developing counties. Relevant \r\norganizations and agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem and of the OIC should contribute to the transfer \r\nof technology and capacity building in the relevant \r\nfields. \r\n We commend the OIC’s ongoing cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) \r\nepitomized by the signing of the memorandum of \r\nunderstanding for cooperation. Bangladesh attaches \r\nhigh importance to the activities relating to the \r\ndevelopment of a model curriculum for population \r\neducation, training and workshops in the OIC \r\ncountries. We also believe that there should be more \r\nexchanges among the OIC countries in the field of \r\npopulation and reproductive health. Recent successes \r\nin some of the OIC member States could be emulated \r\nin others through appropriate programmes, with \r\n \r\n 29 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\ntechnical and financial assistance from the United \r\nNations system. \r\n Before closing, allow me to make a few remarks \r\non the issue of poverty eradication, to which \r\nBangladesh always attaches very high importance. The \r\npoverty situation in many of the OIC countries remains \r\na cause for concern. We have come to accept today that \r\nin fighting poverty there is a need for a broader and \r\ncomprehensive strategy at the local, national and \r\ninternational levels. Given the magnitude of the \r\nproblem, the most sensible approach would be to \r\ncoordinate action among the actors, both governmental \r\nand non-governmental, at all levels. Some non-\r\ngovernmental organizations have received worldwide \r\nacclaim for their work in eradicating poverty in a \r\nnumber of countries. Valuable experience such as this \r\nis worth sharing through joint programmes of the \r\nUnited Nations and the OIC. \r\n Bangladesh wholeheartedly supports the draft \r\nresolution on this subject contained in document \r\nA/55/L.17, and will support its consensus adoption. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 3369 (XXX) of 10 \r\nOctober 1975, I now call on the observer for the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. \r\n Mr. Lamani (Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference): I welcome the opportunity, and consider \r\nit a privilege, to address the General Assembly on \r\nagenda item 24, entitled “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference”. A review of the status of cooperation \r\nbetween our two organizations has now become a \r\nregular feature of the deliberations of the annual \r\nsessions of this body. I bring the Assembly greetings \r\nfrom Mr. Laraki, Secretary General of the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference (OIC), and his best wishes \r\nfor the success of all its endeavours at this session. \r\n Since this is the first time that the OIC has \r\naddressed the plenary of the General Assembly at its \r\npresent session, I take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, and through you, your colleagues \r\nin the Bureau, on your election to your high offices. I \r\nknow that under your capable hands, Sir, the work of \r\nthe Assembly will be very ably directed. I also join \r\nother delegations in paying tribute to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab. \r\n We have read with interest the report of the \r\nSecretary General, contained in document A/55/368. \r\nWe commend the Secretariat for its part in the \r\npreparation of the report, which, as before, includes \r\ncontributions from other organizations of the United \r\nNations system. The report in large part details the \r\nstatus of implementation of programmes and activities \r\nin priority areas of cooperation jointly developed by \r\nour two organizations and by our respective specialized \r\nagencies and institutions during the period under \r\nreview. The progress of implementation, as reported, is \r\nencouraging and, with regard to the OIC and its \r\nspecialized and affiliated institutions, I assure the \r\nAssembly of our collective and continued enthusiasm \r\nand dedication to the tasks that are being jointly \r\npursued. \r\n Without in any way belittling the relevance or \r\nimportance of the report, we note, however, that some \r\nUnited Nations agencies have considered it useful to \r\ntake advantage of the opportunity to describe their \r\nactivities with the OIC and its institutions undertaken \r\nin years prior to the period under review, and that a few \r\nhave gone on to report on their regular activities in \r\nOIC member States outside of the scope of the United \r\nNations/OIC cooperation framework. I express the \r\nhope that, in the interest of clarity and accuracy, the \r\nagencies concerned will find it desirable to report on \r\nactual activities undertaken with the OIC and its \r\ninstitutions and implemented during the periods under \r\nreview. With this observation, I once again express my \r\nappreciation to the Secretariat for the useful and \r\ninformative material presented in the report. \r\n Ambassador Hasmy Agam, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Malaysia, in his capacity as \r\nChairman of the Islamic Group, has graciously \r\nintroduced the draft resolution on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. It is before the Assembly in document \r\nA/55/L.17. I take the liberty of drawing attention to \r\nthree of the thirteen operative paragraphs, because of \r\ntheir significance. \r\n First, operative paragraph 4 requests our two \r\norganizations to: \r\n “continue to cooperate in their common search \r\nfor solutions to global problems, such as \r\nquestions relating to international peace and \r\nsecurity, disarmament, self-determination, \r\ndecolonization, fundamental human rights, social \r\n \r\n30  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nand economic development and technical \r\ncooperation”. \r\n In compliance with the Assembly’s resolutions in \r\nprevious years, contacts and interactions between the \r\nUnited Nations and the OIC have been maintained, and \r\nthey will continue to be strengthened through the \r\nIslamic Group and a number of OIC contact groups and \r\ncommittees at the United Nations. The Permanent \r\nObserver Missions of the OIC to the United Nations in \r\nNew York and in Geneva are actively participating in \r\nthe work of the General Assembly and other United \r\nNations organs in the capacity of observers and are \r\nserving as channels of communication and consultation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the OIC and its \r\nspecialized and affiliated institutions in all matters of \r\nour common concern. We look forward to further \r\nstrengthening this cooperation in the future. \r\n Secondly, operative paragraph 6 refers in the \r\nlatter part to the close cooperation between the two \r\norganizations in continuing to search for a peaceful and \r\nlasting solution to the conflict in Afghanistan. As the \r\nSecretary-General’s report reflects in paragraph 6, \r\nrecent developments on the issue involved an OIC \r\ninitiative to convene two rounds of indirect talks with \r\nthe United Front and the Taliban at the OIC \r\nheadquarters in Jeddah, with the participation of \r\nMr. Francesc Vendrell, the Secretary-General’s \r\nPersonal Representative for Afghanistan. The efforts of \r\nthe OIC regarding Afghanistan will continue to be \r\ncomplementary to and in support of the central role of \r\nthe United Nations until such time as a peaceful and \r\ncredible resolution of the Afghan conflict is reached. \r\n Thirdly, operative paragraph 11 focuses on \r\ncooperation and coordination between the two \r\norganizations in the political, economic, social and \r\ncultural fields. Encompassing these fields are the \r\ncurrent complementary roles of our two organizations \r\nin promoting a dialogue among civilizations. The idea \r\nwas initiated within the framework of the OIC, which \r\nis collaborating with the United Nations in \r\ncommemorating 2001 as the Year of Dialogue among \r\nCivilizations. We express the hope that these efforts \r\nwill lead to better understanding among peoples of \r\ndifferent cultures, ethnicity and religions in all \r\ncountries of the world. \r\n At this stage I draw attention to the fact that none \r\nof the operative paragraphs in the draft resolution have \r\nadditional financial implications, so I express the hope \r\nthat it will attract the General Assembly’s unanimous \r\napproval. \r\n Before closing, I wish to take the liberty of \r\nspeaking of the forthcoming change of executive heads \r\nin an important subsidiary organ of the General \r\nAssembly — the United Nations Population Fund \r\n(UNFPA), with which the OIC and some of its \r\nspecialized and affiliated institutions have enjoyed \r\nfruitful collaboration. We salute the outgoing \r\nExecutive Director, Dr. Nafis Sadik, for her superior \r\nabilities, leadership and invaluable contribution to the \r\ndevelopment of the Fund and especially for her \r\nunstinting support of the OIC and UNFPA cooperation \r\nin areas of common interest. We wish her a pleasant \r\nand well-deserved retirement and a long life full of \r\nhappy memories, success and fulfilment in all her \r\nfuture pursuits and undertakings. \r\n We are gratified that in Ms. Thoraya Obaid, the \r\nExecutive Director designate, the Secretary-General \r\nhas identified a lady of great professional competence. \r\nMs. Obaid’s support of OIC-UNFPA cooperation is \r\nwell known, and we express the hope that this \r\ncooperation will be further enhanced during her tenure \r\nof office. It is equally gratifying to note that both the \r\noutgoing and incoming Executive Directors are from \r\nOIC member States, so their achievements have not \r\nonly spelled pride and delight for Pakistan and Saudi \r\nArabia, but have also brought honour to the OIC, and \r\nwe are delighted and grateful. \r\n I would conclude on a note of hope and \r\nexpectation about future cooperation between our two \r\norganizations in all areas in which the best interests of \r\nour common member States can be served. We are both \r\nembarked on the journey to peace and progress, and we \r\nmust continue to be guided by those very \r\nconsiderations and principles that have characterized \r\nour past collaboration and that will be needed even \r\nmore for our future destination: the global village of \r\nthe new millennium. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/55/L.17. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/55/L.17? \r\n Draft resolution A/55/L.17 was adopted \r\n(resolution 55/9). \r\n \r\n 31 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\n The Acting President: I call on the \r\nrepresentative of Armenia for an explanation of \r\nposition after adoption of the draft resolution. I remind \r\ndelegations that such explanations are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n Mr. Akopian (Armenia): Armenia joined the \r\nconsensus on the draft resolution entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nthe Islamic Conference”, since we regard the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) as one \r\nof the most important and influential international \r\norganizations, created to apply the great humanistic \r\nvalues revealed in the Holy Koran to the political \r\nrealities of today. The OIC has proved to be entirely \r\ndedicated to the principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter, and it is no surprise that it is highly respected \r\nby the international community and that its voice is \r\nalways listened to attentively. \r\n Since the report of the Secretary-General \r\nmentions in paragraph 3 the problem of Nagorny \r\nKarabakh, I would like to share some concerns in this \r\nregard. For nearly a decade the OIC has been \r\naddressing the issue of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict, \r\nadopting resolutions on the matter. Of course, the OIC \r\nis free to consider any issue that affects the interest of a \r\nmember State. But it becomes more and more obvious \r\nthat those who introduce this issue into the OIC agenda \r\nand propose unbalanced and one-sided resolutions thus \r\ntry to present the conflict also as a religious one \r\nbetween Christian Armenia and Muslim Azerbaijan, \r\nwhereas in reality the true and only nature of the \r\nconflict is in depriving a people under alien domination \r\nof its legitimate right of self-determination, the right of \r\nwhich the OIC is a longtime supporter. As for the \r\nArmenian side, it has always refrained from using the \r\nreligious factor, considering it unacceptable to exploit \r\nreligion for purely political reasons. Such a step will \r\nonly aggravate the situation, giving it a completely \r\ndifferent and extremely dangerous dimension. \r\n The OIC is an organization in which Armenia \r\ncannot present its position and defend its case. But we \r\nknow that the overwhelming majority of the OIC \r\nmember States do not have full information about and \r\ncomplete understanding of the conflict and have to rely \r\non whatever is presented by interested sides. Several \r\nyears ago we invited the OIC Secretary General to visit \r\nArmenia and Nagorny Karabakh or to send a \r\ndelegation on his behalf to get an idea also about our \r\nvision of the conflict. Unfortunately, that never \r\nhappened. Had it happened, not only would the OIC \r\nresolutions have had more balanced and tolerant \r\nlanguage, but probably the OIC itself would have \r\nengaged more positively and would have helped to \r\ncreate an atmosphere of mutual confidence between the \r\nconflicting sides. \r\n The Holy Koran says that the Almighty created \r\ndifferent nations so that they might know each other. \r\nThe President of Iran has developed that profound and \r\nmeaningful Koranic verse into the great idea of a \r\ndialogue among civilizations. That idea has been \r\nwelcomed and supported by the United Nations. It is \r\nour sincere wish to see the region of the southern \r\nCaucasus, where two great civilizations meet, be a \r\ngood example of that dialogue. We believe that the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference will help turn \r\nthat wish into reality. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of position after the adoption of \r\nthe draft resolution. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto conclude its consideration of agenda item 24? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 25 \r\n \r\n \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nLeague of Arab States \r\n \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/55/401) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution A/55/L.18 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Iraq to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/55/L.18. \r\n Mr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): In my \r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Arab Group for the month \r\nof October, I would like on behalf of the Arab \r\ndelegations that are members of the League of Arab \r\nStates (LAS) to introduce draft resolution A/55/L.18 \r\nunder item 25 of our agenda, entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab \r\nStates”. \r\n The League of Arab States was established at the \r\nsame time as the United Nations, in March 1945. We \r\nare proud of the close links that exist between the \r\n \r\n32  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States, which \r\nrepresent a tangible example of the cooperation and \r\ncoordination between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations referred to in Chapter VIII of the Charter. \r\nSuch relations and links have developed positively \r\nsince the General Assembly adopted a consensus \r\ndecision at its forty-eighth session to ensure \r\ncooperation between the two organizations. This \r\nrelationship covers widely varying kinds of joint \r\ncooperation. \r\n In the two organizations we examine issues \r\nrelated to international peace and security. Given the \r\ncurrent events taking place in the occupied Arab \r\nterritories, there is real need to enhance our \r\ncooperation and to strengthen the participation of the \r\nUnited Nations so that it may play an effective role in \r\nending the aggression perpetrated by the racist forces \r\nof the Israeli occupiers against the Palestinian people. \r\nSimilarly, there is an urgent need to enhance \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nLeague of Arab States in economic, social and \r\ndevelopment areas so there can be greater development \r\nin Arab countries and so we can achieve the shared \r\ngoals of the two organizations. \r\n The preamble of the draft resolution before us \r\ncontains paragraphs that emphasize the desire of both \r\norganizations to consolidate the bonds of cooperation \r\nbetween them in all areas and to enhance that \r\ncooperation for the purpose of achieving the goals of \r\nboth organizations. \r\n In operative paragraph 3 the draft resolution \r\nexpresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe follow-up action taken by him to implement the \r\nproposals adopted at the meetings between \r\nrepresentatives of the secretariats of the United Nations \r\nand other organizations of the United Nations system \r\nand the General Secretariat of the League of Arab \r\nStates and its specialized organizations. \r\n The draft resolution also calls for continued \r\nefforts to enhance cooperation in the political, \r\neconomic, social, humanitarian, cultural and \r\nadministrative fields. \r\n The draft resolution reaffirms the importance of \r\nholding the next general meeting on cooperation \r\nbetween the representatives of the secretariats of \r\norganizations of the United Nations system and the \r\nGeneral Secretariat of the League of Arab States and its \r\nspecialized organizations during 2001. \r\n In conclusion I would like, on behalf of the \r\nLeague of Arab States, to call upon the General \r\nAssembly — which is representative of the \r\ninternational community — to support cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab \r\nStates. We ask that the draft resolution be adopted by \r\nconsensus. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 477 (V), of 1 November \r\n1950, I now call on the Observer for the League of \r\nArab States. \r\n Mr. Hassouna (League of Arab States) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Allow me, at the outset, to express to the \r\nPresident our sincere congratulations on his election to \r\nthe presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n A few days ago, the world observed the fifty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations \r\non 24 October 1945. That anniversary recalls the \r\nexpectations and hopes placed in the Organization by \r\nthe peoples of the world. At the same time, it highlights \r\nthe huge gap between the state of affairs existing at the \r\ntime the Organization was established and the current \r\ncircumstances at the beginning of a new millennium \r\nthat presents new and serious threats. As the first \r\nregional organization established in 1945 under the \r\nnew world order imposed by the Second World War, \r\nthe League of Arab States now enters the new \r\nmillennium, while welcoming its growing role as a \r\npartner of the United Nations in various administrative, \r\nlegal, cultural, social, economic and political areas. \r\n We consider the United Nations as a melting pot \r\nin which all regional and international efforts coalesce \r\nto realize mankind’s hopes and ambitions. The League \r\nof Arab States has always expressed its keen interest in \r\nconsolidating its cooperation and in coordinating its \r\nactivities with the United Nations in order to find \r\nsolutions to questions relating to peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. The legal frame of reference for that \r\ncooperation is found not only in the provisions of the \r\nrespective charters of the two organizations, but also in \r\na new frame of reference provided by the \r\nreaffirmation, in the Millennium Declaration of 8 \r\nSeptember 2000, of the need to promote cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \r\nin accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIII of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. \r\n \r\n 33 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\n I turn now to areas of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States. Here, \r\nI pay particular tribute to the Secretary-General for the \r\ncomprehensive way in which his report (A/55/401) \r\ncovers the cooperation that has taken place since the \r\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The \r\nreport outlines consultations and exchanges of \r\ninformation between the two organizations at various \r\nlevels, and follow-up action on proposals agreed to at \r\ngeneral meetings between organizations of the United \r\nNations system and the League of Arab States. In that \r\nconnection, I stress the importance of continued \r\nconsultations between the Secretaries-General of the \r\nUnited Nations and of the League of Arab States on a \r\nvariety of Arab and international questions. This has \r\ncontributed to the containment and settlement of a \r\nnumber of crises. \r\n I also hail the productive cooperation between the \r\nLeague of Arab States and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) since the signing on \r\n22 September 1999 of a cooperation agreement \r\nbetween the League and UNDP and the implementation \r\nof that agreement in the field of public administration \r\nand in the social, economic, environmental, cultural, \r\ninformation and human development areas. \r\n Among the most important instances of \r\ncooperation between the two organizations during the \r\nperiod under review was the May 2000 sectoral \r\nmeeting on youth and employment between the United \r\nNations and the League of Arab States. The outcome of \r\nthat meeting has both social and economic implications \r\nfor the Arab region. I wish also to note that the League \r\nof Arab States and the Economic and Social \r\nCommission for Western Asia (ESCWA) have jointly \r\norganized and convened a number of successful \r\nregional meetings, notably several relating to the \r\nquestion of Arab women. The importance that the \r\nLeague of Arab States attaches to the role of women is \r\nreflected in the convening in November 2000, with \r\nUnited Nations participation, of the first summit of \r\nArab women on the theme of present challenges and \r\nfuture prospects; it will focus on the role of Arab \r\nwomen and their history in society-building and in \r\nmeeting the challenges facing the Arab nation. \r\n I express the pride and pleasure of the League of \r\nArab States at the fact that two Arab women were \r\nrecently appointed to senior United Nations posts, as \r\nthe Executive Director of the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund and as the Regional Director of the \r\nUNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States. \r\n The Assembly’s consideration today of the draft \r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States does not take place in \r\nisolation from the efforts of the two international \r\norganizations to bring about a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East on the basis of \r\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter and \r\nresolutions of international legality.  \r\n In that context, heads of State or Government of \r\nArab States, at the conclusion of the special Arab \r\nsummit held at Cairo on 21 and 22 October 2000, \r\naffirmed that Israel, the occupying Power, bears \r\nresponsibility for having returned the region to a \r\nclimate of tension and violence through its acts of \r\naggression, its practices and its siege of the \r\nPalestinians, all of which constitute a breach of its \r\nobligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention \r\nrelative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of \r\nWar, of 12 August 1949, and a flagrant violation of the \r\nrules of international law, and which have damaged \r\nefforts to build peace in the region. \r\n The Arab leaders reaffirmed that peace must be \r\njust and comprehensive if it is to be lasting. They \r\nreaffirmed that the Arab approach to peace demands \r\nthat Israel manifest equal commitment through \r\ncompliance with international law, and in particular \r\nwith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and \r\n338 (1973) and General Assembly resolution 194 (III), \r\nrelating to the right of return and compensation for \r\nPalestinian refugees, along with all other relevant \r\ninternational resolutions and the principles of the peace \r\nprocess, first and foremost the principle of land for \r\npeace. \r\n While welcoming the increased role of the United \r\nNations in salvaging and reviving the peace process on \r\nall tracks, the League of Arab States calls upon the \r\nOrganization to work to bring about the \r\nimplementation of the resolutions it has adopted over \r\nthe years on the question of Palestine, the question of \r\nthe Middle East and the question of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. \r\nThat would sustain the Organization’s credibility and \r\nwould legally, morally and politically obligate all \r\nStates to implement those resolutions. \r\n We reaffirm in conclusion that the League of \r\nArab States, which has long enjoyed observer status in \r\nthe United Nations and which has cooperated with the \r\n \r\n34  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.44  \r\nOrganization on a variety of programmes, looks \r\nforward to the consolidation and deepening of that \r\ncooperation. The League hopes that our common \r\nobjectives will be attained through such cooperation. \r\nWe are confident that the Assembly’s consensus \r\nadoption of the draft resolution before it today will be \r\na strong motivation to promote and vitalize that \r\ncooperation for the benefit of both organizations. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/55/L.18. May I take it that the General \r\nAssembly decides to adopt the draft resolution? \r\n Draft resolution A/55/L.18 was adopted \r\n(resolution 55/10). \r\n The Acting President: Before calling on the \r\ndelegation wishing to speak in explanation of position, \r\nI remind delegations that statements in explanations of \r\nvote or position are limited to 10 minutes. \r\n Mr. Shacham (Israel): The delegation of Israel \r\nhas joined the consensus on a resolution on this item \r\nfor the seventh time in a row. In doing so, we are \r\nguided by the desire to make peace with our \r\nneighbours, all of which are members of the League of \r\nArab States. Israel supports cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and various regional organizations, \r\nincluding the League of Arab States. Indeed, such \r\ncooperation is based on the provisions of the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\n This is the first resolution on an issue related to \r\nthe Middle East to be adopted by the General Assembly \r\nat its fifty-fifth session. We are pleased that the \r\nresolution was adopted by consensus. In joining the \r\nconsensus, we would like to demonstrate to all parties \r\nour willingness to forgo unnecessary discord in \r\ninternational forums, and to stress the need to exercise \r\nrestraint both in the language of draft resolutions to be \r\nsubmitted and in all related statements. We cannot \r\nrestore confidence and trust in the Middle East by \r\nengaging in polemics in our debates in New York. \r\nPeacemaking is by its very nature a bilateral endeavour \r\nbetween the parties, and controversial rhetoric offered \r\nin international forums is surely counterproductive. \r\n It is unfortunate, however, that this debate \r\nregarding cooperation between the United Nations and \r\na regional organization was exploited by one speaker to \r\ndirect attacks against a Member State and to promote a \r\npartisan political perspective. The latest summit of the \r\nleaders of Arab League States was mentioned in this \r\ndebate; had it not been mentioned, it would not have \r\nbeen necessary for the Israeli delegation to reiterate its \r\nview of the decisions taken at that summit. Israeli \r\nutterly rejected the language of threats used at the \r\nrecent Cairo summit, and condemned the call for \r\ncontinued violence against it. The decisions of the Arab \r\nsummit in Cairo placed responsibility for the recent \r\nevents and for the damage to the peace process \r\nexclusively upon Israel in a distortion of reality and in \r\ndisregard for Israel’s far-reaching readiness to move \r\ntowards an agreement. At Camp David recently, Israel \r\nmade courageous and far-reaching proposals in order to \r\nachieve a peace agreement with the Palestinians and a \r\nhistoric reconciliation with the Arab world. \r\nRegrettably, Chairman Arafat and the Palestinians did \r\nnot respond in any way to these proposals; instead, \r\nthey plunged the region into a whirlpool of violence \r\nand bloodshed. \r\n Israel calls upon the Palestinians to honour their \r\ncommitments to halt the violence and incitement, \r\nimmediately restore calm and order and prevent an \r\nadditional escalation of the violence. Israel stresses \r\nthat it continues to strive for peace while \r\nuncompromisingly defending its vital security \r\ninterests, and it will continue to act to foster \r\nreconciliation between it and the Arab world, but not at \r\nany price and not under pressure of violence.  \r\n Furthermore, Israel felt that the decisions of the \r\nArab summit, which called for a freeze on the \r\nmultilateral talks and cooperation with Israel, are \r\ndisappointing and run counter to the decisions of the \r\nMadrid Conference, which established two tracks — \r\nbilateral and multilateral — side by side. The existence \r\nof channels of communication between the parties is \r\nparticularly important in times of tension and we regret \r\nthe decisions adopted by the Arab summit against \r\nnormalization of relations between Arab States and \r\nIsrael. It is our view that these decisions do not assist \r\nbut, rather, hinder the efforts to establish a \r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in our region. \r\nNevertheless, Israel will not be dissuaded from its \r\ndetermination to move forward and will continue to \r\nstrive to achieve real peace. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.  \r\n \r\n 35 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.44\r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto conclude its consideration of agenda item 25? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: In view of the lateness of \r\nthe hour, I would like to inform members that the \r\nremaining items on the agenda for this morning, \r\nnamely, agenda item 173, “Towards global \r\npartnerships”, and agenda item 183, “Peace, security \r\nand reunification on the Korean Peninsula”, will be \r\ntaken up tomorrow morning as the first two items.  \r\n The meeting rose at 1.45 p.m. \r\n"
