(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 50\r\nCauses of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup on the Causes of Conflict and the\r\nPromotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa (A/55/45)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/55/431)\r\nMr. Aboulgheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Many\r\ninitiatives and thoughts for supporting development in\r\nAfrica have been put forward over the years. However,\r\nthe results have fallen short of realizing the objectives\r\nand aspirations that accompanied each and every one of\r\nthese initiatives. Despite the fact that the development\r\nof any society is the responsibility first and foremost of\r\nthat society and its Government, and despite sincere\r\nefforts to promote and develop African\r\nsocieties — particularly the least developed in the\r\ncontinent — the objectives will not be achieved as long\r\nas the international environment is not supportive.\r\nIn many cases this works against the interests of\r\ndeveloping countries in general, and the least\r\ndeveloped countries of Africa in particular. The\r\nquestions of indebtedness, poverty and the shortfall of\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA), as well as\r\ndisease — in particular, malaria and AIDS — all\r\nrepresent abnormal obstacles that prevent the\r\nattainment of the legitimate aspirations of the peoples\r\nof the continent to development and progress.\r\nDespite the fact that the challenges of\r\ndevelopment and people’s failure to realize their\r\naspirations are considered one of the most salient\r\ncauses of conflict and wars in Africa, we should not\r\nignore the historical origins of these crises and the\r\nnegative role played by many of the past imperial\r\nforces in sowing the seeds of conflict among the newly\r\nindependent States just before their independence,\r\nwhether because of the way they delineated the borders\r\nof these States or by fomenting tribal and ethnic strife\r\namong and between the States of the continent.\r\nI recall these facts so that we do not find\r\nourselves supporting the repeated claims that the\r\nAfrican people bear the original responsibility for their\r\nwars and conflicts, that what is usually called the tribal\r\nnature of these people is to blame or, simplistically,\r\nthat the crisis of development and the causes of conflict\r\nin Africa stem from the tribal circumstances of the\r\nAfrican people or the absence of so-called good\r\ngovernance in some African States. If there is an\r\nelement of truth in these claims, we must also consider\r\nthe whole picture so that our judgement and\r\napportionment of responsibility can be more accurate.\r\nIn facing the challenges of development in\r\nAfrica, the continent sorely needs the United Nations\r\nto undertake a clear, effective and definite role for the\r\nsettlement of conflicts on the continent. Not only does\r\nAfrica expect the United Nations to move to contain\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nthe conflicts that rage on the continent, but it also\r\nexpects the international community to move quickly,\r\nbefore the exacerbation and expansion of these\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe Secretary-General has, on more than one\r\noccasion, shown that the real problem does not stem\r\nfrom the absence of early warning mechanisms that\r\nalert us to the possibility of a crisis on the continent. It\r\nlies, rather, in the need for the United Nations to follow\r\nthese warnings by undertaking speedy and effective\r\nmeasures, which have been lacking. We hope in this\r\nrespect that the United Nations will take seriously the\r\nevents that have recently intensified on the borders\r\nbetween Guinea and Sierra Leone and Liberia and\r\naddress them decisively and quickly, since they presage\r\na new regional conflict in the continent whose\r\nrepercussions we cannot anticipate if the international\r\ncommunity should fail to stem the crisis early.\r\nMore than two and a half years ago, in April\r\n1998, the Secretary-General issued a report on the\r\ncauses of conflict in Africa (A/52/871). There is no\r\ndoubt that the African continent has since witnessed\r\nmany of the developments referred to in the report\r\nregarding peace and security in the continent,\r\npeacekeeping, peacemaking, post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding and creating basic infrastructure to prevent the\r\nresumption of conflicts in Africa in the future.\r\nDuring the same period, we have clearly\r\nwitnessed greater determination by Africa — at the\r\ncontinental level, represented by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), and at the subregional level —\r\nin settling its own disputes and in initiatives\r\nundertaken to end the wars raging in some countries.\r\nThis African determination has been evident on more\r\nthan one occasion, including the role played by the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) in Sierra Leone, President Chiluba’s efforts\r\non the Democratic Republic of the Congo, President\r\nMandela’s efforts in Burundi, the role played by\r\nPresident Bouteflika in ending the conflict between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea and President Omar Guelleh’s\r\ngreat efforts culminating in the establishment of the\r\nfirst national Government in Somalia since 1991.\r\nEgypt has always supported and participated in\r\nAfrican efforts to find African solutions to the\r\ncontinent’s problems. Egypt also reiterates that this\r\nexpanded African role should in no way relieve the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council of their basic\r\nresponsibilities towards the continent. It should not\r\ncontribute to marginalizing the role of the international\r\nOrganization and one of its main organs by supporting\r\nand enhancing regional efforts only so that the role of\r\nthe international community becomes secondary and\r\ncomplementary.\r\nAccordingly, while we welcome the increased\r\nimportance the continent has recently been given\r\nwithin various circles and organs of the United\r\nNations, we still believe there is a large gap between\r\nwhat the international community determines and\r\ncommits to undertake to prevent and resolve conflicts\r\non the continent and the actual steps taken to fulfil its\r\ncollective responsibility in maintaining international\r\npeace and security in Africa and in overcoming the root\r\ncauses of the conflicts that have severely damaged the\r\ncontinent’s political, economic and social\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nThe report of the Open-ended Working Group\r\n(A/55/45) before us clearly emphasizes that the\r\ngenuine will of the international community in\r\nresponding to African conflicts is absent. We are\r\nhopeful that the United Nations response to the conflict\r\nthat began last May in Sierra Leone will be the rule and\r\nnot the exception in the international community’s\r\ntreatment of African conflicts, which have become very\r\ncomplicated due to their political, security, ethnic and\r\nsocial dimensions. In this regard, we look forward to\r\nthe Security Council’s commitment, in accordance with\r\nthe Millennium Declaration adopted by the General\r\nAssembly on 8 September 2000, to rededicate itself to\r\nattaching equal importance to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security in all regions of the\r\nworld, while attaching special importance to Africa and\r\nits unique needs and requirements.\r\nWe are also encouraged by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s statement, at the thirty-sixth session of the\r\nOAU summit at Lomé last July, that the United Nations\r\nis ready to assist Africa at all times and with all means\r\navailable. We hope that the Secretary-General will\r\ncontinue to offer his good offices so that the United\r\nNations will remain focused on African issues and\r\nproblems and so that it will follow up the\r\nimplementation of the Secretary-General’s valuable\r\nrecommendations on the causes of conflict in Africa.\r\nCertainly there are many other areas in which we\r\nexpect the international community to show interest in\r\nsupport of African endeavours to achieve peace,\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nstability and democracy on the continent. Unlike the\r\nrole we require the United Nations to undertake under\r\nthe Charter in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, the efforts of the international community,\r\nwe hope, will be concentrated on supporting and\r\nreactivating the OAU Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution and will\r\ncontribute generously to the trust fund established by\r\nthe United Nations for that purpose.\r\nWe also call on the United Nations to support\r\nefforts within the continent to implement the plan of\r\naction adopted at the recent Lomé summit, as proposed\r\nat the Conference on Security, Stability, Development\r\nand Cooperation in Africa, and to continue its activities\r\naimed at supporting other structures and mechanisms in\r\nvarious fields in the continent agreed to by the African\r\nStates.\r\nThe Working Group on the causes of conflict in\r\nAfrica plays a central role in following up the\r\nimplementation of the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations, in determining the obstacles to their\r\nfull implementation and in presenting specific\r\nproposals to reach the desired objectives. Undoubtedly,\r\nthe report prepared by the Working Group is a worthy\r\nachievement that is useful for maintaining the\r\nmomentum to enhance and coordinate all activities and\r\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations and its\r\nrelevant agencies for the establishment of peace,\r\ndevelopment and stability in Africa.\r\nIn this regard, I wish to express the Egyptian\r\ndelegation’s appreciation for the efforts of the co-Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Group, the Ambassadors of Singapore\r\nand Spain, in guiding the Working Group during the\r\nlast session of the General Assembly. We hope that the\r\nmandate of the Working Group will be extended to the\r\nnext session of the General Assembly so that it will\r\ncontinue to play the important role entrusted to it under\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 54/234.\r\nWe, the Ambassadors of Africa are confident that\r\nthe sincere efforts of the President of the General\r\nAssembly and the personal interest he has shown\r\nduring our discussions with him will ensure the best\r\npossible participation and support for the Working\r\nGroup from the entire membership of the Assembly.\r\nWe assure the President of our complete readiness to\r\ncooperate with him and with the Bureau of the Working\r\nGroup dealing with this issue so that we may achieve\r\nthe laudable objectives which we all desire.\r\nThe President: I would like to thank the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt for his cooperation in helping\r\nus begin the debate on time. I would also like to thank\r\nthe representative of Singapore for his readiness to help\r\nour debate to proceed smoothly.\r\nMr. Mahbubani (Singapore): I have to begin on\r\na sombre note. First, we would like to thank all our\r\nfriends and colleagues who have conveyed their\r\nsympathies and condolences to us on the tragic crash of\r\nthe Singapore Airlines aircraft in Taipei yesterday.\r\nSecondly, as nationals of several countries lost their\r\nlives in the accident, we would also like to convey our\r\nsincere condolences to all the families who lost loved\r\nones in the crash.\r\nI would now like to begin my formal remarks on\r\nthe agenda item, Mr. President, by thanking your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for inviting me to\r\nserve as a Vice-Chairman of the open-ended Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on the Causes of Conflict and the\r\nPromotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa. I was equally privileged to\r\nhave served alongside my fellow Vice-Chairman,\r\nAmbassador Inocencio Arias, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Spain. Ambassador Arias brought to\r\nour common task wisdom, humour and strong\r\ndiplomatic skills, which helped to guide our Working\r\nGroup to a successful conclusion.\r\nThe mandate of our Working Group was to\r\nmonitor the implementation of the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report of April\r\n1998, as well as the proposals made by the Economic\r\nand Social Council at its substantive session in 1999.\r\nWe began our work with modest expectations. The\r\nrecord of open-ended working groups within our house\r\nis, unfortunately, a mixed one. New Zealand’s United\r\nNations Handbook lists four open-ended working\r\ngroups. Two have suspended their work. One, the\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform, is still\r\ncontinuing its work. The Working Group on Africa is\r\ntherefore the fourth to have been established. Given the\r\ntrack record of our peers in the area of working groups,\r\nwe were afraid that we would achieve little. In the end,\r\nwe were relieved that we made some progress.\r\nAll in all, we had three meetings: in March, May\r\nand July this year. At the first session, in March, the\r\nWorking Group decided that it required more\r\ninformation on the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nreport. Hence, we invited the relevant organizations of\r\nthe United Nations system and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions to address the Group. At the second\r\nsession, we received comprehensive briefings from the\r\nDirector for Regional and African Affairs of the\r\nExecutive Office of the Secretary-General and from\r\nMr. Nitin Desai, the Under-Secretary-General of the\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs, and from\r\nrepresentatives from 15 different agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nBoth Ambassador Arias and I encouraged\r\ninteractive discussion at the second session. As a\r\nresult, we learned a considerable amount of useful\r\ninformation. To facilitate a substantive discussion\r\namong members, all participants were also provided\r\nwith detailed matrices prepared by the Office of the\r\nSpecial Coordinator for Africa and the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries (OSCAL). The matrices, which\r\nare contained in the conference paper issued as\r\ndocument (A/AC.258/CRP.3), systematically charted\r\nthe status of the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. The matrices also laid out a rough roadmap of\r\nfurther steps to be taken by the United Nations system,\r\nas well as by Member States.\r\nOur Working Group received a concrete request\r\nto set up a one-stop web site containing background\r\ninformation on the work of the Group, its working\r\ndocuments and the statements and reports made to the\r\nGroup. Fortunately, the web site was launched and\r\noperated by OSCAL towards the end of June. The Web\r\nsite, whose address, incidentally, is given in the report\r\nbefore the Assembly, served as a resource tool to\r\nfacilitate the work of the Group. It is also a permanent\r\nWeb resource for future use by resumed sessions of the\r\nGroup. I think OSCAL should be commended here for\r\nthe effort it put into designing and maintaining the Web\r\nsite, as that Web site provides a vivid and live record of\r\nthe work of the Group.\r\nOur final session was spent negotiating the\r\nWorking Group’s final report. We were pleased to\r\nreach a consensus after the usual last-minute\r\nnegotiations. Both Ambassador Arias and I commend\r\nthe report to the Assembly for its adoption.\r\nThe good news on this issue is that there is now\r\nnear universal recognition that Africa has special\r\nneeds. The Millennium Summit Declaration, for\r\nexample, had a separate section calling on the\r\ninternational community to meet the special needs of\r\nAfrica. There is also widespread acknowledgement that\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on Africa and the\r\nsubsequent initiatives, including the work of our\r\nWorking Group, have moved the process forward.\r\nHowever, the bad news is that there seems to be little\r\ntangible progress on the ground. Africa as a whole\r\nholds 13 per cent of the world’s population, but is\r\nresponsible for only 2 per cent of its economic output.\r\nAfrica is also the only region of the world that is likely\r\nto almost double its population in the next 25 years. By\r\nthen Africa will have 17 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation.\r\nToday, at least 45 per cent of Africans live in\r\npoverty, barely surviving on less than $1 a day. Only\r\n15 per cent of Africans today live in an environment\r\nconsidered minimally adequate for sustainable growth\r\nand development. Two hundred million Africans have\r\nno access to health facilities, while 2 million African\r\nchildren die before the age of five. It is estimated that\r\nAfrican countries need annual economic growth rates\r\nof 7 per cent or more to eliminate poverty in 15 years,\r\nwhich is the goal set in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nto the Millennium Assembly. However, African\r\ncountries are only growing at an annual average rate of\r\n3 per cent. Clearly, these are depressing statistics. A lot\r\nmore needs to be done to reverse these trends. The\r\nWorking Group therefore still has many tasks ahead.\r\nBoth Ambassador Arias and I would like to encourage\r\ngreater participation from all Member States, African\r\nand non-African alike, in the work of the Group, as\r\nsome of our sessions were, unfortunately, sparsely\r\nattended.\r\nThere are a lot of significant new initiatives on\r\nAfrica; for example, the Africa Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act and the recent Common Market for\r\nEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Free Trade\r\nArea. Some effort should be made to coordinate all\r\nthese initiatives and to ensure that they all work\r\ntogether to help Africa. The key test of the success of\r\nthis Working Group, as well as of this and other\r\ninitiatives, is that one must show substantive results on\r\nthe ground. Enough papers have been written on\r\nAfrica’s needs. The time has now come to seek\r\nconcrete results.\r\nSuccess will ultimately be possible only if the\r\nglobal community becomes a stakeholder in Africa’s\r\nprogress. In a shrinking globe, as we move towards\r\nbecoming a true global village, we cannot afford to\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nleave behind any section of our village community.\r\nMany studies have indeed been written about the\r\ndangers of leaving behind sections of our community.\r\nA recent book by Mr. Thomas Homer-Dixon entitled\r\nThe Ingenuity Gap: How Will We Solve the Problems of\r\nthe Future makes the following observations:\r\n“If a society develops a serious ingenuity\r\ngap — that is, if it loses the race between\r\nrequirement and supply — prosperity falls in the\r\nregions already affected by scarcity, and people\r\nusually migrate out of those regions in large\r\nnumbers. Social dissatisfaction rises, especially\r\namong marginal groups in ecologically fragile\r\nrural areas and urban squatter settlements. These\r\nchanges undermine the government’s legitimacy\r\nand raise the likelihood of widespread and\r\nchronic civil violence. Violence further erodes the\r\nsociety’s capacity to supply ingenuity, especially\r\nby causing human and financial capital to flee”.\r\nWe therefore urge all members of our global\r\ncommunity to participate more actively in the work of\r\nthe Working Group on Africa; let it not suffer the fate\r\nof similar working groups.\r\nMr. Levitte (France) (spoke in French): I am\r\npleased to take the floor on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. The Central and Eastern European countries\r\nassociated with the European Union — Bulgaria, the\r\nCzech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\nPoland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the\r\nassociated countries Cyprus and Malta, as well as the\r\nEuropean Free Trade Association country member of\r\nthe European Economic Area, Liechtenstein, align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the opportunity to\r\nexamine today the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on the Causes of Conflict and the\r\nPromotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa. The Working Group, which\r\nmet on three occasions, each lasting a week, in March,\r\nMay and July 2000, made a number of\r\nrecommendations in various areas, all of which are\r\nfundamental for the future of the African continent:\r\npoverty eradication; HIV/AIDS; environment; debt;\r\ndevelopment financing; conflict prevention, peace and\r\nconflict management; refugees; and better coordination\r\nof international aid.\r\nBefore going into details concerning the\r\nsignificant lessons we may draw from the Working\r\nGroup’s proceedings and from the detailed\r\nrecommendations made in its report, I should like to\r\nreiterate the European Union’s commitment to the\r\nestablishment of an integrated United Nations approach\r\ntowards Africa. Such an integrated approach must\r\neffectively take into account the political, social and\r\neconomic dimensions of conflict prevention and\r\nconflict resolution. Very clearly, that is one of the\r\nessential recommendations of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport (A/52/871) published in April 1998. This is an\r\nissue which is as topical as ever, and which once again\r\nhas been highlighted in the report (A/55/305) of the\r\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations chaired by\r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi: development without peace is no\r\nmore possible than peace without development. The\r\nEuropean Union thus intends to continue tirelessly to\r\nurge that Africa’s specific needs regarding peace and\r\ndevelopment should be taken into greater account in all\r\ninternational forums, particularly those of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe European Union is encouraged by the\r\npositive and constructive atmosphere that always\r\nprevailed in the meetings of the Working Group.\r\nAlthough the pitfall of duplicating the debate in other\r\nforums was not always avoided, the hearing given by\r\nthe Working Group to representatives of United\r\nNations agencies, funds and programmes and to the\r\nSecretary-General’s representatives on the ground\r\nundeniably helped enrich our collective thinking. The\r\nquality of the Working Group’s endeavour is also\r\nreflected in the content of what is a balanced and\r\nreasonably determined report. In large part, this is\r\nthanks to the personal involvement of the Chairman,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and also to the energetic and\r\ndetermined action of the two Vice-Chairmen,\r\nAmbassadors Kishore Mahbubani of Singapore and\r\nInocencio Arias of Spain, from whom the Assembly\r\nhas just heard. The European Union would like to\r\nsalute the decisive contribution of those individuals to\r\nthe success of this exercise, which was not a foregone\r\nconclusion.\r\nOn the Working Group’s working methods, I must\r\nalso add that the European Union was particularly\r\nimpressed by the intelligent and intensive use of the\r\nInternet. The creation of a web site devoted to the\r\nWorking Group’s proceedings enabled delegations to\r\nkeep constantly abreast of the progress of discussions\r\nand of the contributions made by all participants; it\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nalso made the outside world better acquainted with the\r\nWorking Group’s approach.\r\nFor the European Union, it is thus absolutely\r\nessential that the General Assembly provide concrete\r\noperational follow-up to the Working Group’s\r\nsuggestions and that the investment made, which is\r\nconsiderable, not be overlooked or underutilized.\r\nOn the actual content of the Working Group’s\r\nreport, the European Union still regrets, as we said last\r\nJuly, that sufficiently strong emphasis has not yet been\r\nplaced on the decisive issue of conflict prevention. The\r\ngrave crises that have occurred in Africa since the\r\npublication of the Secretary-General’s report in April\r\n1998 — the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, the increased\r\nrisk of the Sierra Leone conflict spilling over into\r\nneighbouring countries — show that we can never\r\ninvest enough in prevention. The United Nations must\r\nalso provide more and better support for regional\r\nefforts towards peace and security, including, where\r\nnecessary, by making available financial or human\r\nresources. For its part, the European Union has played\r\nan active role in the mediation exercise conducted by\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) in the\r\nEthiopian-Eritrean conflict, and intends to continue\r\nthat effort. The European Union notes with great\r\ninterest the latest recommendations of the Security\r\nCouncil mission to Sierra Leone with respect to\r\nincreasing the assistance to be provided to the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) regarding regional security.\r\nStill on the analysis of the causes of conflicts and\r\non doing a better job of averting them, the European\r\nUnion fully supports the initiatives taken by the\r\nSecurity Council to gain a better understanding of the\r\neconomic origins and commercial aspects of certain\r\nAfrican crises and denouncing the links between\r\ntrafficking in raw materials and in arms. The\r\nestablishment of the follow-up mechanism for applying\r\nsanctions against UNITA, the setting up of a panel to\r\ninvestigate the illegal exploitation of the resources of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the\r\nestablishment of a panel to inquire into illegal\r\ntrafficking in diamonds and arms in Sierra Leone are\r\nall examples of this new approach. The European\r\nUnion fully supports the better coordination of all these\r\ninitiatives within an expert structure that could be a\r\nunified structure: by definition, trafficking knows no\r\nborders, and the criminal interests are often the same\r\nfrom one crisis to another.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the fact that the\r\nEconomic and Social Council has chosen Africa as a\r\ntheme for high-level debate at its next substantive\r\nsession, to be held in July 2001. It is imperative that\r\neconomic and social thinking on Africa be coordinated\r\nand consistent within the United Nations system. Here,\r\nthe European Union is pleased with the content of the\r\nmillennium report prepared by the Secretary-General\r\n(A/54/2000) and by the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nEuropean Union remains firmly committed to\r\nimplementing the recommendations of that\r\nDeclaration.\r\nTurning to the observations of the Working Group\r\non the issue of debt, I should like to reiterate that the\r\nEuropean Union considers the reinforced Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative to be\r\nan essential element in combating poverty and\r\nachieving the objectives of sustainable development.\r\nTo date, the European Union has provided 68 per cent\r\nof the total contributions paid into the trust fund for\r\nfinancing the HIPC Initiative. We call upon eligible\r\ncountries to carry out their international political\r\ncommitments and to take the political and economic\r\nmeasures necessary to engage in this process and to\r\nensure that the funds generated by this initiative are\r\ndirected towards the social sector, such as education\r\nand health, and promote the rule of law, good\r\ngovernance, the participation of civil society and\r\nhuman development.\r\nI would not like to end my statement without\r\nrecalling the determined commitment of the European\r\nUnion to continue its ongoing dialogue with African\r\ncountries on all of these issues. The success of the\r\nAfrica-Europe Summit, held in Cairo in April 2000\r\nunder the auspices of the European Union and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, requires us to do so. We\r\nshall resolutely continue on that path.\r\nMs. King (United States of America): I should\r\nlike to congratulate the Governments of Singapore and\r\nSpain on their assumption of the leadership of this\r\ncritical task.\r\nThe report before this Assembly is a broad\r\ninvestigation of the roots of conflict and a host of other\r\nills that continue to bedevil the African continent. I\r\nsubscribe to its observations and recommendations, but\r\nI want to use this important forum to offer some\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nobservations based on our work in the United Nations\r\nover the past 15 months.\r\nThis discussion has raised some important\r\nquestions about the causes of conflict today. Of course,\r\nthese questions and answers are not unique to Africa —\r\nconflict has existed on every continent — but they do\r\nseem particularly acute in Africa. To my mind, there\r\nare four critical questions. First, does poverty cause\r\nconflict in Africa? While the relationship between\r\npoverty and conflict cannot be denied, it is much more\r\ncomplex than one of simple cause and effect. Some of\r\nAfrica’s most tragic countries are some of the world’s\r\nrichest in natural resources — the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Sierra Leone and Angola, for example.\r\nSome of the poorest countries are at peace. In\r\neconomic terms, Mali is among the poorest countries\r\nwithin the United Nations. However, from the grass-\r\nroots level to the presidential palace, Malians are\r\nworking together to build a better life for themselves\r\nand their children. They are building democracy.\r\nThough they face many challenges, armed conflict is\r\nnot one of them.\r\nSecondly, do ethnic divisions cause conflict in\r\nAfrica? Too many of the world’s conflicts, whether in\r\nCentral Africa, the Balkans or East Timor, have been\r\nattributed to ancient ethnic hatreds. This could not be\r\nmore wrong. Ethnic groups do not have genetic codes\r\nfor violence and conflict. Indeed, the most recent\r\nscientific breakthroughs on the human genome\r\nhighlight an important fact: in genetic terms, all human\r\nbeings, regardless of race or ethnicity, are more than\r\n99.9 per cent the same. This means that modern science\r\nhas confirmed what many of us first learned through\r\nour faiths: the most important fact of life on earth is\r\nour common humanity.\r\nSo why is it that some choose to fight over such\r\nminor differences? I contend that it is because of\r\ncynical leaders — leaders who seek any means possible\r\nto exploit others for personal gain; leaders who choose\r\nnot to celebrate and draw strength from the minor\r\ndifferences within humanity, but to exacerbate and\r\nmagnify these minor differences for their own\r\nambitions.\r\nIt has been just over a year since the world\r\nmourned the loss of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, a leader\r\nwho presided over a country that is a glorious mosaic\r\nof cultures and languages and which today enjoys a\r\nstrong and vibrant national identity. On the other side\r\nof the equation, Somalia might be the most ethnically\r\nhomogeneous country in Africa, yet it was plunged into\r\na chaos from which it is only now beginning to emerge.\r\nHutu and Tutsi violence in Rwanda and Burundi\r\ndoes not reflect a permanent animus. Rather, it\r\nrepresents a divide-and-conquer strategy by which\r\ncolonial and post-colonial politicians sought to\r\nperpetuate their rule. Such people are not true\r\nnationalists; they are opportunists who seek to stoke\r\nnationalist and ethnic fires for their own personal gain.\r\nAs we have seen all over the world, politicians and\r\nopportunists who sow the seeds of ethnic chauvinism\r\nfor self-advancement can plunge entire regions into\r\nchaos. They — not the forces they unleash — are\r\nresponsible for the violence that ensues.\r\nThirdly, do religious differences cause conflict in\r\nAfrica? We see the same twisted dynamic at work as\r\nleaders try to exploit religious differences for personal\r\ngain. Until very recently, there had never been any\r\ntensions between Christians and Muslims in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire. Sectarian violence was unheard of in one of\r\nAfrica’s strongest economies and most open and\r\nwelcoming societies. In most parts of East and West\r\nAfrica, Christians and Muslims coexist with no\r\ndifficulties. However, in many countries — not just in\r\nAfrica — unscrupulous leaders often try to create\r\nsectarian violence as a means to political influence.\r\nThat is an indictment of those individuals, not of the\r\nmillions of faithful who can live in harmony.\r\nI took note when the Ivorian Minister of the\r\nInterior visited the mass grave of victims of recent\r\nunrest and said that the massacre was alien to the\r\nculture of his great country and a source of shame for\r\nall Ivorians. That sentiment was almost as important as\r\nhis pledge of a full and immediate investigation, for it\r\nshowed that such acts are contrary to the political and\r\ncivic culture of Côte d’Ivoire, and must remain that\r\nway.\r\nFourthly, do colonial boundaries cause conflict in\r\nAfrica? Apart from those from island Member States,\r\nall of us live in places with arbitrary boundaries; yet\r\nthis does not make conflict inevitable. Zambia borders\r\ntwo countries racked by conflict — Angola and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo — and three more\r\nthat have had internal conflicts in the past 25 years:\r\nNamibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Zambia’s\r\npeople share common languages and identities with all\r\nof their neighbours, and the country’s boundaries\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nreflect the intersection of Belgian, British, German and\r\nPortuguese colonialism. However, Zambia is at peace\r\nwith itself and its neighbours.\r\nAgain, I refuse to believe that conflict is\r\ninevitable. In accordance with United States experience\r\nin the Balkans and more recently in Africa, we reject\r\nthe thesis that so-called ancient hatreds determine the\r\nfate of nations. We also reject the concept of a “failed”\r\nState. States and peoples do not fail; leaders fail.\r\nPerhaps the true cause of conflict in Africa is\r\nunaccountable governance. If there is war when people\r\nwant peace, the inescapable conclusion is that the\r\nGovernments making war are not listening to their\r\npeople.\r\nTake any conflict — internal or external — in\r\nAfrica today. Whether we discuss Angola, Sierra\r\nLeone, Liberia, Guinea, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Côte d’Ivoire, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan,\r\nEthiopia, Eritrea or Somalia, the international\r\ncommunity and, more importantly, the people in these\r\ncountries, need to ask the following questions. Where\r\nare the parliaments demanding to know why the\r\nexecutive branches have committed the resources of\r\nthe State to a conflict? Where are the courts demanding\r\nto investigate charges of human rights abuses and\r\noutright theft? Where are the newspapers and radio\r\nstations demanding to know who made the decision to\r\ngo to war? Where is civil society to tell armed\r\nmovements to lay down their weapons and enter the\r\npolitical life of their countries? Where are the\r\nopposition political parties demanding votes of\r\nconfidence in Governments that make war? Where are\r\nthe trade unions, churches and civic organizations\r\ndemanding to know why their men are sent to fight and\r\ndie in wars that are not of their making? Where are the\r\nwomen’s organizations demanding to know why their\r\nGovernments and movements make war when their\r\nchildren cannot afford to go to school? Where are the\r\nMinistries of Finance and the central banks demanding\r\nan accounting of money spent and stolen by officials of\r\nthe State itself? Where are the opportunities for voters\r\nto change Governments that make war or repudiate\r\nmovements that will not make peace?\r\nThe Security Council is charged with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nHowever, nowhere in the Charter of the United Nations\r\ndoes it say that we are collectively responsible for\r\nensuring good government in other peoples’ countries.\r\nWhat are we to do, however, if our obligation to\r\nmaintain peace and security conflicts with our desire to\r\nmaintain the national sovereignty of our members? We,\r\nas the United Nations, and we, as the Security Council,\r\ncan address the effects of conflicts and even alleviate\r\nmany of the symptoms of conflict. However, only\r\nthrough the advancement of the universal principle of\r\naccountable governance, which we believe comes with\r\ndemocracy, can we truly begin to live up to the\r\nchallenges embodied in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe United Nations and the United States share a\r\nwonderful common bond: our founding documents\r\nbegin with the phrase “We the people.” Although the\r\nUnited Nations Charter uses the word “peoples,” I\r\nbelieve that in either case a reading of our instructions\r\nreally does not need to go any further than the first\r\nthree words.\r\nThere has been much talk over the last year about\r\nwhich organ of the United Nations is supreme. At the\r\nend of the day, we believe that in our people lies the\r\ntrue authority of this Organization, or of any\r\nGovernment. I do not mean the people as an abstract\r\nconcept; I mean the people as the individuals who, for\r\nexample, will decide on 7 November if some of us in\r\nthis room have to find a new line of work. When every\r\nPresident, every Minister and every Permanent\r\nRepresentative in Africa knows that his or her job\r\ndepends on the approval of their people, I predict that\r\nthe job of maintaining international peace and security\r\nin that part of the world will get easier.\r\nMr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation thanks the Open-ended Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on the Causes of Conflict and the\r\nPromotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa for its report, which has offered\r\na systematic analysis of the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations in the Secretary-General’s report; it\r\nalso offers an analysis of the agreed conclusions on\r\nAfrican development adopted at the Economic and\r\nSocial Council substantive session of 1999, and the\r\nobstacles facing such implementation. In addition, it\r\nputs forward recommendations for further action in this\r\nregard. We appreciate the outstanding jobs done by\r\nMr. Mahbubani, Ambassador of Singapore, and\r\nMr. Arias, Ambassador of Spain, in their capacity as\r\nthe two Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group.\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nIn the United Nations Millennium Declaration,\r\nthe heads of State or Government expressed their\r\nresolve to\r\n“support the consolidation of democracy in\r\nAfrica and assist Africans in their struggle for\r\nlasting peace, poverty eradication and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, thereby bringing Africa into the\r\nmainstream of the world economy”.\r\nThis marks the latest commitment made by the\r\ninternational community for Africa and is one of vital\r\nimportance.\r\nSeventy per cent of the conflicts discussed in the\r\nSecurity Council are in Africa; therefore, African\r\nconflicts should arouse our concern. The Brahimi\r\nreport contains many views and recommendations\r\nregarding peacekeeping operations in Africa. We hope\r\nthat the work of the Working Group will be matched\r\nwith the recommendations of the Brahimi report and\r\nwill play a great role in peace-making, peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building following conflicts in Africa. We\r\nhope that the Security Council will attach importance\r\nto this.\r\nThanks to the efforts of African countries and the\r\nsupport of the international community, the African\r\neconomy has looked up in recent years. However,\r\naccording to statistics, the general situation in Africa is\r\nstill worrisome, and the gap between its development\r\nlevel and that of the world as a whole continues to\r\nwiden. The small and vulnerable economies in Africa,\r\nand the least developed countries in particular, have\r\nfound themselves in an even less favourable situation.\r\nCurrently, 52 per cent of the African population still\r\nlive on less than one dollar a day. The absolute\r\nmajority of the 48 least developed countries of the\r\nworld, the absolute majority of the world’s refugees,\r\nand 90 per cent of the world’s children who have\r\nbecome orphans because their parents have died of\r\nHIV/AIDS, are in Africa.\r\nGiven the opportunities and potential brought\r\nabout by globalization, it is a shame to see that the vast\r\nnumber of African countries have been excluded from\r\nglobalization, that they have been marginalized, or\r\neven forced to bear the negative impact of the process;\r\nthis is something that no one can accept with peace of\r\nmind.\r\nOn the one hand, African countries should bear\r\nthe responsibility for their own prosperity, stability and\r\ndevelopment. On the other hand, it is also a common\r\ntask of the international community. The peace- and\r\ndevelopment-related problems in Africa have been\r\ninherited from the past; they are long-standing and\r\ndeep-rooted. They have complex social, economic and\r\nother kinds of causes and need to be addressed by\r\nAfrican countries and the international community with\r\na comprehensive and integrated approach. The\r\noverriding priority at present is to see to it that the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General on the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa, as well as the relevant\r\ncommitments in the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration, will be translated into more effective\r\nactions.\r\nAccording to the report of the Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup, African countries and the international\r\ncommunity have already taken many steps to\r\nimplement the Secretary-General’s recommendations,\r\nsome of which have yielded positive results. However,\r\njust as the report has pointed out, there are still many\r\nobstacles in the way of the implementation process.\r\nThe recommendations put forward in the report for\r\novercoming those obstacles and for taking further\r\nactions have already been largely accepted by African\r\ncountries. It is our hope that when further actions are\r\npursued, country-specific programmes will be\r\ndeveloped on the basis of the specific conditions of the\r\ncountries concerned. The responsibilities of the country\r\nconcerned and those of the international community\r\nshould also be specified for better fulfilment.\r\nI wish to highlight the following points pertaining\r\nto international actions in this regard. First, the\r\ninternational community should pay attention to the\r\nspecial needs of Africa and assist African countries to\r\nintegrate into the world economy and achieve\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. In this\r\nera of great changes, the institutional capacities of\r\nAfrican countries are still too weak for them to\r\ncompete successfully on the global level. For this\r\nreason, in discussions concerning international\r\neconomic, financial and trade policies, it is extremely\r\nimportant to ensure that we have the participation of\r\nthe African countries and that their interests be well\r\nprotected. At the same time, it is necessary to\r\nstrengthen the development of human resources and\r\ncapacity-building in other fields.\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nSecondly, there should be a stronger flow of\r\nfunds to Africa. At the present stage, Africa still has a\r\nlot of practical difficulties in absorbing private\r\ninvestments and official development assistance (ODA)\r\ncontinues to play a dominant role there. Therefore,\r\nthere is an enormous need for ODA to be increased as\r\nsoon as possible to the level of 0.7 per cent of the gross\r\nnational product (GNP) of developed countries, as\r\npromised. At the same time, all Governments and\r\ninternational organizations should look for feasible\r\nmethods to encourage foreign direct investment in\r\nAfrica. We also hope to see tangible results in this\r\nregard at the high-level international intergovernmental\r\nevent on financing for development to be held next\r\nyear.\r\nThirdly, steps should be taken to increase market\r\naccess for African countries. In particular, developed\r\ncountries should eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers\r\nagainst superior products from Africa, so as to help\r\nAfrican countries enhance development through trade.\r\nFourthly, the external debts of African countries\r\nshould be further reduced and cancelled. At present,\r\nrelevant proposals on debt relief have failed to achieve\r\nsatisfactory results and have given rise to worries on\r\nthe part of many African countries. We appeal to\r\nrelevant international financial institutions and major\r\ncreditor countries to listen to the voice of African\r\ncountries and take bigger steps forward in this regard.\r\nFifthly, real actions should be taken to promote\r\ntransfers of technology, including efforts to create\r\ninformation technology opportunities for African\r\ncountries. In particular, we should give priority to\r\nhelping African countries build their infrastructures\r\nand develop human resources in order to support their\r\nuse of information technology so as to achieve rapid\r\ngrowth.\r\nSixthly, the unchecked spread of infectious\r\ndiseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria, which are a great\r\ndrain on human and economic resources, has become a\r\nserious economic and social problem in African\r\ncountries, as well as a big challenge to their security.\r\nWe welcome the efforts made by African countries and\r\nthe international community to fight against these\r\ndiseases. We also support the proposal to convene a\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the issue of\r\nHIV/AIDS, and we hope the special session will\r\nmobilize entire societies and provide effective policies\r\nand measures, with a view to winning the war against\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nFinally, we endorse the recommendation of the\r\nAd Hoc Working Group’s report that the great number\r\nof proposals on the issue of Africa must be sorted out\r\nand narrowed down to effective and well-coordinated\r\nones, so as to make a greater use of precious resources,\r\nimprove efficiency and create maximum favourable\r\nconditions for African development. We are of the view\r\nthat the mandate of the Ad Hoc Working Group should\r\nbe extended, in order to continue to promote the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nThe China-Africa Cooperation Forum, Ministerial\r\nConference, Beijing 2000 was successfully convened\r\n10 to 12 October. Approximately 80 ministers from 45\r\nAfrican countries and representatives of about 20\r\nregional organizations attended this event. The twin\r\nthemes of the conference were, first, how to push ahead\r\nwith the establishment of a fair and just new\r\ninternational political and economic order in the\r\ntwenty-first century so as to safeguard the common\r\ninterests of developing countries, and, secondly, how to\r\npromote China-Africa cooperation under new\r\ncircumstances, in substantive fields such as trade and\r\nthe economy. Participants had an extensive exchange of\r\nviews in this regard. The Conference adopted the\r\nBeijing Declaration of the China-Africa Cooperation\r\nForum and the programme for China-Africa\r\ncooperation in economic and social development. The\r\nformer reflected the common ground between China\r\nand Africa on major international issues, while the\r\nlatter provided highly detailed and feasible\r\nprogrammes for China-Africa cooperation in all fields.\r\nAt the forum, China made four commitments\r\nconcerning its continued support for the economic and\r\nsocial development of African countries. First, China\r\nundertook to provide, within its capacity and within the\r\nframework of South-South cooperation, all forms of\r\nassistance and aid to African countries, in accordance\r\nwith the specific economic conditions of those\r\ncountries. China’s assistance and aid to Africa do not\r\nhave any political conditions attached to them and are\r\nnot aimed at seeking any political privileges. Also, so\r\nas to better satisfy the needs of African countries,\r\nChina’s assistance and aid will grow and be more\r\neffectively delivered as China’s economy and overall\r\nnational strength grow. Secondly, the Chinese side is\r\nundertaking to reduce or cancel debts amounting to 10\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nbillion yuan renminbi owed by the heavily indebted\r\npoor countries and least-developed countries in Africa\r\nin the coming two years. Thirdly, the Chinese side will\r\nset aside special funds to support and encourage\r\ninvestment by Chinese enterprises in African countries.\r\nAt the same time, China will help expand exports from\r\nAfrican countries to China based on the principle of\r\ngiving preference to African products, other things\r\nbeing equal. Fourthly, China will establish an African\r\nhuman-resources-development fund and expand China-\r\nAfrica cooperation in a wider range of fields,\r\nespecially in the fields of human-resources\r\ndevelopment, science and technology, and education.\r\nThe fund will gradually grow in scale as a means to\r\nhelp African countries train more professional staff of\r\nall kinds.\r\nThe China-Africa Cooperation Forum was a\r\ncollective dialogue between the two sides conducted at\r\nthe turn of the century, as well as a successful and\r\nimportant exploration of their common development. It\r\nalso marks China’s new contribution to the promotion\r\nof South-South cooperation. We hope that the Forum\r\nwill make greater contributions to peace and\r\ndevelopment on the African continent.\r\nMr. Kpotsra (Togo) (spoke in French): This is\r\nthe third straight time since the publication in April\r\n1998 of the important report of the Secretary-General\r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has considered this item. This year\r\nthe Assembly will be discussing the item in the light of\r\nthe report drafted by the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup, established pursuant to resolution 54/234. But\r\nthis consideration will take place with constant\r\nreference to the specifically African aspects of this\r\nquestion expressed in the Millennium Declaration\r\nadopted on 8 September 2000.\r\nWe will also be mindful of the fact that our\r\nconsideration of the report on the causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa by various bodies — in\r\nparticular the Security Council, the General Assembly\r\nand the Economic and Social Council — has already\r\nallowed us to analyse its political, economic and social\r\nrecommendations and to define operational approaches\r\nto be followed in their implementation.\r\nI wish to express my profound gratitude to Mr.\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-fourth session, and to the two Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Ad Hoc Working Group, the\r\nPermanent Representatives of Spain and Singapore, for\r\ntheir excellent work.\r\nFollowing its three sessions, the Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup concluded that the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral demonstrates that, despite some progress,\r\nobstacles remain to their effective implementation and\r\nthat new guidelines are necessary to hasten it. The\r\nareas identified by the Ad Hoc Working Group as\r\nhaving enjoyed progress are numerous and various.\r\nAlthough real and tangible, this progress should not\r\ninduce us to lose sight of the need to pursue efforts to\r\nfind new, innovative solutions. The work that remains\r\nto be done is enormous.\r\nI turn now to peacemaking. The Security Council\r\nhas accorded special attention to improving sanctions\r\nregimes in Africa, to the plight of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons in Africa and to the protection of\r\nchildren in armed conflict. It has shown its resolve to\r\nconsider post-conflict peace-building, as demonstrated\r\nby its initiatives in Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and the\r\nCentral African Republic. Recent public debates and\r\nthe resolutions adopted in their wake are eloquent\r\ntestimony to this new dynamism in its work.\r\nWhat is revealing of the pre-eminent role that the\r\nSecurity Council intends to play in conflict prevention\r\nand resolution in Africa is the fact that the Council is\r\nseeking to acquire a better understanding of the\r\nconflicts besetting the continent. This approach is\r\nevident not only in field missions dispatched this\r\nyear — particularly to the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Eritrea/Ethiopia and Sierra Leone — but also in\r\nits direct dialogues with the protagonists to the\r\nconflicts. We might consider, for example, the public\r\nmeetings and private consultations held in January\r\n2000 with several heads of State of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) in relation\r\nto the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nIn this context of multiple conflicts, it becomes\r\nclear that any action to implement the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations must necessarily fail in\r\nunstable areas and that, without peace and stability,\r\nthere can be no activities to establish sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. This is the point being made by\r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group when it stresses in\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nparticular the need for the political will that must\r\nunderpin any effort of Africans themselves and the\r\ninternational community. Accordingly, Africa is trying\r\nto fight the proliferation of and illicit traffic in small\r\narms and light weapons that sustain conflicts and\r\ntransborder crime.\r\nWe hope that the Pan African Conference of\r\nMinisters on this issue, to be held at Bamako from\r\n30 November to 1 December, will provide African\r\ncountries with an opportunity to prepare for the\r\nforthcoming United Nations Conference on the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects, to be held next year.\r\nWe cannot discuss progress in the implementation\r\nof the recommendations which the Secretary-General\r\nmakes in his report without stressing that Africa is\r\ntrying, through such Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) mechanisms as the African Ministerial\r\nConference on Security, Stability, Development and\r\nCooperation in Africa, to create conditions conducive\r\nto sustainable development. Th Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup supports this process and calls on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to help implement it.\r\nOne point worth making is that Africa has, in\r\nmany cases predating the Secretary-General’s report,\r\ncreated instruments for conflict management, such as\r\nthe OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution, the Conflict Management\r\nCentre and the Early Warning System. The subregional\r\ninitiatives of African States should also be mentioned\r\nas part of this trend. However, these mechanisms must\r\nreceive financial support if we genuinely wish to\r\nstrengthen African peacekeeping capacities.\r\nDespite the Security Council’s renewed interest in\r\nAfrica, our continent remains host to the most deadly\r\nconflicts and to the most refugees and displaced\r\npersons. With particular respect to refugees in Africa,\r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group stresses the fact that the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) and other competent bodies have\r\nundertaken activities to strengthen their security and to\r\nsafeguard the civilian, humanitarian nature of their\r\ncamps and shelters. However, these actions, like so\r\nmany other initiatives — and I am thinking in\r\nparticular of the partnership between the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the World Bank and\r\nthe UNHCR — have failed qualitatively to improve the\r\nplight of refugees in Africa. In many cases, refugees\r\nremain the sole responsibility of the host countries,\r\nwhich, given their own precarious economic situation,\r\nare unable to give them the required assistance. I\r\ncannot fail to emphasize once again how disturbing it\r\nis to become aware of the extreme imbalance between\r\nthe way refugees are treated in Africa and the\r\nassistance they receive in other parts of the world.\r\nIn the light of all this, the thirty-sixth OAU\r\nSummit — which stressed the need for African States\r\nto continue to address the underlying causes of the\r\nproblem of refugees in Africa — strongly urged the\r\ninternational community to provide the necessary\r\nresources and funds to undertake the comprehensive\r\nimplementation plan adopted at the ad hoc meeting of\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental technical experts,\r\nheld under the auspices of the OAU and UNHCR in\r\nConakry, Guinea, from 27 to 29 March 2000, as well as\r\nthe recommendations of the sixth OAU-International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross Seminar on International\r\nHumanitarian Law, held in Addis Ababa on 15 and\r\n16 May.\r\nAfrica hopes that this appeal will be promptly\r\nheeded. We applaud the recent appointment of\r\nMr. Ruud Lubbers to the post of High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees and call on him to make action for\r\nrefugees in Africa one of his priorities during his term\r\nof office.\r\nThe question of relief for African debt has been\r\nidentified by the Ad Hoc Working Group as one area in\r\nwhich the Secretary-General’s recommendations have\r\nalso begun to be implemented. As I stressed recently\r\nbefore the Second Committee when discussing the item\r\non macroeconomic policy questions and the external\r\ndebt crisis, we cannot fail to recognize that, in recent\r\nyears, the international community has striven to\r\nundertake commendable initiatives to help implement\r\nappropriate solutions to problems of debt stock and\r\ndebt servicing. We are pleased to refer to the decision\r\ntaken in Cologne in June 1999 by the Group of 8 to\r\nenhance the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\n(HIPC) Initiative, which was endorsed in September\r\n1999 by the International Monetary and Financial\r\nCommittee of the International Monetary Fund and the\r\nDevelopment Committee of the World Bank. Pursuant\r\nto a choice made by the Group of 8 itself, nine heavily\r\nindebted countries are already benefiting from this\r\ndecision.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nHowever, these one-time solutions will not enable\r\nsub-Saharan African countries to devote the bulk of\r\ntheir resources on basic social services — far from\r\nit — because debt reimbursements divert valuable\r\nresources from projects, the implementation of which\r\nwould help to eradicate poverty. That is why the thirty-\r\nsixth OAU Summit demanded that the HIPC Initiative\r\nbe extended to all African countries as a step towards\r\nthe simple cancellation of African debt.\r\nIt is encouraging that the Ad Hoc Working Group,\r\nwhich is in favour of cancelling the debt of the least\r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), suggested that the\r\nGeneral Assembly give serious consideration to the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\nproposal to set up an independent body to evaluate the\r\nviability of African debt, with a commitment to cancel\r\nthe debt of the highly indebted poor countries — debt\r\nthat is considered unlikely to be repaid. We hope that\r\nthese recommendations and all other initiatives will be\r\nconsidered in depth at the intergovernmental event on\r\nfinancing for development, to be held in 2001, in which\r\nAfrica intends to take a very active part.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Working Group has identified a\r\nnumber of obstacles to the speedy implementation of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendations in his report\r\n(A/52/871) on the causes of conflict and the promotion\r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. These obstacles have to do with, inter alia, the\r\ngeneral public health situation. In this regard, we agree\r\nthat if there is one area where there has been a dramatic\r\ndeterioration in the situation since the publication of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General, it is the incidence\r\nof HIV/AIDS and its impact on Africa’s future. This\r\npandemic has become a real development problem and\r\nrepresents a real threat to the survival of the human\r\nrace, particularly in Africa.\r\nAt this session the General Assembly intends to\r\ngive serious thought to the question of HIV/AIDS. We\r\nwelcome that, because there is no doubt that if there is\r\none problem that requires urgent, concerted and\r\nenergetic intervention by the international community,\r\nit is the struggle against this pandemic. The situation of\r\nAIDS orphans in Africa, who, according to some\r\npredictions, will number 40 million in 2010, shows the\r\nsocial impact of this pandemic, whose effects are made\r\nworse by the high cost of medicines.\r\nApart from HIV/AIDS, malaria is a source of\r\ngreat concern for Africa. Statistics indicate that there\r\nare 400 million people suffering from malaria in the\r\nworld, 300 million of them in Africa, and that 2 million\r\npeople die of this disease each year. Its impact goes far\r\nbeyond the area of public health; it has now become an\r\nimportant socio-economic development question.\r\nThis tragic situation impelled the African heads\r\nof State and Government, at a special meeting in Abuja\r\non 24 and 25 April 2000 to adopt the Declaration and\r\nPlan of Action on “Roll Back Malaria”, on the basis of\r\nwhich the thirty-sixth summit of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity deemed it timely to appeal to the United\r\nNations to proclaim 2001-2010 the decade to reduce\r\nmalaria. Africa hopes that the General Assembly will\r\nfollow up on this request very soon.\r\nThe crucial health problems facing Africa\r\nhighlight Africa’s lack of financial resources. As we\r\nknow, the best initiatives to promote economic and\r\nsocial development in Africa must be supported by the\r\navailability of adequate financial resources. However,\r\nwe note with concern that official development\r\nassistance (ODA) has been declining since 1990. From\r\n$23 billion in 1992, it dropped to $18 billion in 1997,\r\nand this trend is continuing inexorably. At the same\r\ntime, we note with regret that this decline also affects\r\nmultilateral assistance, because development aid\r\nprovided by United Nations funds and programmes and\r\nspecialized agencies is also declining, thus\r\njeopardizing the development of African States. It is\r\nencouraging, however, that some countries, such as\r\nDenmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland have reached\r\nor even gone beyond the goal of 0.7 per cent of GDP\r\nfor ODA. It is essential that all donor countries resolve\r\nto raise their ODA levels to the goal of 0.7 per cent of\r\nGNP for the developing countries and 0.15 per cent for\r\nthe LDCs.\r\nIn this regard, the holding of a meeting on\r\ndevelopment aid for Africa, for which the Working\r\nGroup is strongly pushing, would be an opportunity for\r\ndonor countries to exchange experience in this area.\r\nWe know that the overall increase of private capital\r\nflows to developing countries has largely\r\novershadowed Africa. Furthermore, whereas private\r\nloans have practically stopped for Africa, and the total\r\namount of private, non-settled, short-term debt was in\r\n1997 more than $6 billion higher than in the first years\r\nof that decade, domestic savings in most African\r\ncountries continue to be marked by structural\r\nweakness.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nThis precarious situation, which characterizes the\r\nstate of financial resources in African countries and\r\ncondemns them to absolute poverty, prompted the\r\nGeneral Assembly to state at the special session,\r\nCopenhagen + 5, that, despite the battle that has been\r\nwaged since 1995 against poverty, the number of very\r\npoor people has constantly increased and that there\r\npersist serious doubts as to whether we will attain the\r\ngoal of reducing poverty by half by 2015.\r\nIn the same context, we cannot be surprised if\r\nAfrica has doubts about whether the objectives defined\r\nby the Dakar Framework for Action, “Education For\r\nAll,” adopted at the World Education Forum in April\r\n2000, can be attained.\r\nIn the light of the points I have made, and given\r\nthe urgent need to find ways to implement the\r\nrecommendations in the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the causes of conflict, we believe that in order to\r\nenable our continent to deal with its enormous\r\nproblems the mandate of the Ad Hoc Group should be\r\nextended. It is also wise, we feel, to support the\r\nproposal that the new mandate of the Ad Hoc Group\r\nshould include the establishment of sub-groups to deal\r\nwith specific areas, as indicated in chapter IV of the\r\nreport before us.\r\nSpecial emphasis should be placed on the\r\ncontribution of the Economic and Social Council. We\r\nwelcome its initiative to plan, during its substantive\r\n2001 session, a high-level segment on the role of the\r\nUnited Nations system in supporting the efforts of\r\nAfrican countries in bringing about development. In\r\naddition, there should be close cooperation between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council on this\r\nsubject.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to stress that, aware of its\r\nbasic responsibility for efforts relating to the promotion\r\nof development, Africa is determined to work to\r\nimprove its political, economic and social situation. In\r\nthis endeavour, we hope to continue to enjoy the\r\nattention and kind support of all those who wish to help\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe President: As members will have seen, we\r\nhave made some changes in the sequence of speakers at\r\nthis meeting, due to the absence of some speakers at\r\nthe beginning. We are now returning to the original list\r\nof speakers. I hope that all speakers will be in the Hall\r\non time for future meetings, to avoid disturbances of\r\nthe debate such as we have experienced today.\r\nMay I also remind members of our practice that\r\nall speakers not present in the Hall on time will be\r\nplaced at the very end of the list of speakers. I intend to\r\nadhere to that practice.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to extend the condolences of my delegation\r\nto the fraternal and friendly country of Singapore\r\nfollowing yesterday’s Singapore Airlines aeroplane\r\naccident. I also wish to express condolences to the\r\nfamilies of all of the victims.\r\nMr. Mungra (Suriname), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMy delegation wishes first to express heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session, on\r\nhaving established and chaired the Open-ended Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group to consider the follow-up to the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/52/871) on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa.\r\nCongratulations and sincere gratitude go likewise\r\nto the two Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group, Mr.\r\nKishore Mahbubani and Mr. Inocencio Arias,\r\nPermanent Representatives of Singapore and Spain to\r\nthe United Nations. They conducted the Group’s work\r\nwith competence, commitment and professionalism, in\r\naccordance with the mandate of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation took an active part in the Group’s\r\nwork, and we salute the spirit of consensus shared by\r\nall the participants as well as the culture of dialogue\r\nwhich prevailed throughout the three sessions which\r\nculminated in the report before us today, whose\r\nstructure makes it easy to read and understand.\r\nIt is clear from the Group’s conclusions that\r\nimportant progress was made in implementing the\r\nrecommendations in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral: progress in the promotion of peace, the\r\npeacekeeping and in peace-building; progress in the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms in Africa; and progress in\r\nattaining social development goals, in providing access\r\nto markets and relative progress in debt relief efforts.\r\nBut there has also been progress in the process of\r\ncooperation and regional integration as well as in the\r\nharmonization and coordination of multilateral and\r\nbilateral initiatives for the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the continent.\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nWe should definitely emphasize this progress, but\r\nit needs to be seen in the context of the constraints that\r\nstill impede the free development of Africa. As is\r\nrightly stressed in the report of the Working Group,\r\nobstacles remain — in some cases, increasing\r\nobstacles — to the effective implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General: lack of real\r\npolitical will on the part of the international\r\ncommunity; insufficient resources and capacities;\r\ngovernance problems in certain African countries; and\r\nthe persistence of internal or inter-State armed\r\nconflicts. As a matter of urgency, we need to silence\r\nthe weapons and to understand that there can be no\r\nsustainable development in Africa without peace.\r\nHence it is important that Africa make sure that its\r\npeace concerns are tied to the relevant\r\nrecommendations in the Brahimi report (A/55/305).\r\nOther obstacles are limited access to scientific and\r\ntechnological innovations and, finally, the weakness of\r\nthe private sector in Africa.\r\nThese are real obstacles. Far from denying or\r\nunderestimating them, my country believes that we\r\nneed to consider them and take the right steps to\r\novercome them. But while some are the responsibility\r\nof the Governments of the African countries, others are\r\nthe responsibility of the international community,\r\nparticularly of the champions of development in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThere is no doubt that at the national level\r\nAfrican countries should invest more in building and\r\nconsolidating the rule of law, in good governance and\r\nin respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nSimilarly, regional and subregional preventive\r\ndiplomacy and crisis resolution mechanisms must be\r\ntruly operational. At the same time, they must\r\ndemonstrate more political will to implement the\r\ncommitments they have freely entered into for the\r\npromotion of regional integration. The signing, last\r\nJuly, in Lomé of the Constitutive Act of the African\r\nUnion, was a step in the right direction, which the\r\ninternational community should support. Similarly,\r\nAfrican Administrations have a basic responsibility to\r\ndesign and implement sustainable inclusive social\r\ndevelopment policies, strengthen gender equality,\r\nimplement coherent economic policies and combat\r\npoverty, illiteracy and unemployment.\r\nThese objectives will not be attained in a context\r\nof armed conflict, with the bulk of our national\r\nresources being diverted to military purposes. Nor can\r\nwe combat HIV/AIDS in Africa if Africa spends only\r\n$165 million a year on AIDS, whereas the Joint United\r\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\r\nestimates that $2 billion to $3 billion is needed to\r\ncombat the disease.\r\nThe basic question is, therefore, financing for\r\ndevelopment, which is particularly crucial today, since\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) continues to\r\ndrop in quality and quantity. Because of Africa’s\r\nlimited access to private capital markets and because of\r\nthe drop in ODA, which has not been supplemented by\r\ndirect foreign investments, deficiencies which the\r\nreport of the Working Group recognizes, it is important\r\nthat the international community deal with these basic\r\nquestions. Moreover, weak domestic savings, the heavy\r\ndebt burden and high tariffs all continue to limit access\r\nto markets. Therefore, it is important that urgent, bold\r\nmeasures be taken reverse this negative trend,\r\nparticularly in the current context of double-speed\r\nglobalization, whose current patterns have led to a\r\nsense of insecurity by weakening the ability of\r\nGovernments to control and manage their national\r\npolicies.\r\nAs the Millennium Declaration states,\r\nglobalization will benefit everyone equitably only if a\r\nmajor new sustained effort is made to build a common\r\nfuture based on our shared human condition. This\r\neffort should produce policies and measures at the\r\nworld scale consonant with the needs of the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report and the Working\r\nGroup’s report have helped to create momentum with\r\nregard to Africa, and this should be maintained. This is\r\nwhy my delegation calls for a methodical follow-up on\r\nthe Working Group proposals by the General Assembly\r\nand all of the bodies of the United Nations system.\r\nThis follow-up work should deal, inter alia, with the\r\nsix thematic areas proposed by the Group: poverty\r\neradication, debt relief, financing for development, the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS, the prevention of conflict and\r\npeace-building, the plight of refugees and displaced\r\npersons and, finally, the question of the coordination\r\nand rationalization of the various initiatives for Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish, on behalf of my country, to\r\nsupport the proposals to extend the Working Group’s\r\nmandate and to develop reliable criteria to assess the\r\nimpact of the measures taken and the results obtained\r\nin the implementation of the relevant recommendations\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nof the Secretary-General. In that same spirit, my\r\ndelegation is pleased that the Millennium Declaration,\r\nadopted by our heads of State and Government,\r\ncontains a whole section on Africa. My delegation\r\nwould suggest that in the follow-up work we take into\r\naccount the recommendations on Africa adopted at the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nFirst, allow me to express our condolences and\r\nsympathy to the Government and the people of\r\nSingapore and the families of the deceased following\r\nthe tragic Singapore Airlines accident yesterday\r\nmorning in Taipei.\r\nThe issues of conflict resolution, sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica have been the focus of discussions in the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its main bodies and other\r\ninternational organizations, such as the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development, the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization, the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations and the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO), to name but a few.\r\nIn view of the gravity of the situation, in January\r\nthis year the Security Council held a special session to\r\naddress the state of Africa and how to resolve the\r\ncrisis, and stressed the need for the international\r\ncommunity to resolve the African crisis in the areas of\r\npeace, development and health on an urgent basis. The\r\nMillennium Summit recognized the seriousness of the\r\nAfrican situation and urged that remedial action be\r\ntaken by the international community. In this respect,\r\nwe believe that the root causes of Africa’s\r\nunderdevelopment and conflicts are well known and\r\nunderstood. The challenge is the implementation of\r\nvarious agreed measures to address those problems. In\r\nthis context, we welcome the report of the Open-ended\r\nAd Hoc Working Group, contained in document\r\nA/55/45, which is now before us.\r\nThe report of the Ad Hoc Working Group\r\nidentifies a number of initiatives being undertaken in\r\nthe areas of conflict resolution, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication. It observes that\r\nwhile some progress may be discerned in the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General, there are a number of problems that\r\nneed to be resolved.\r\nThe first step towards addressing the African\r\nproblem is to forge a strong partnership between the\r\ninternational community and the countries affected by\r\nthe crisis. In this regard, we therefore support the call\r\nfor a sustained tripartite effort by the African countries,\r\nthe United Nations system and the donor community.\r\nThis partnership should be aimed at the enhancement\r\nof the efforts Africa is making in the economic, social\r\nand security fields.\r\nIn the area of conflicts, which are hampering\r\nefforts to achieve progress in economic and social\r\ndevelopment in some African countries, it is important\r\nto increase support for the Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the\r\ncorresponding subregional organizations. These\r\nmechanisms are playing a significant role in conflict\r\nprevention and resolution in Africa. Recently, Africa\r\nalso established the Conference on Security, Stability,\r\nDevelopment and Cooperation in Africa. What is\r\nneeded are resources to enable these mechanisms to\r\nprepare better for the task of conflict prevention and\r\nresolution. Notwithstanding these efforts, we fully\r\nendorse the caution expressed in the Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup’s report regarding the fact that the efforts\r\nundertaken by African Governments in this field\r\nshould in no way relieve the Security Council of its\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nTanzania supports the efforts aimed at conflict\r\nresolution in the Great Lakes region, particularly in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi. We\r\ncall upon the international community to support the\r\nLusaka Agreement on the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo since it remains the only firm framework for a\r\ncomprehensive peace in that country. In this regard, we\r\nurge that the peacekeeping force mandated by the\r\nSecurity Council be fully deployed in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo as soon as possible.\r\nThe international community and the regional\r\nleaders have been involved in the search for peace in\r\nBurundi through the Arusha peace process. Some\r\nprogress has been made in this process following the\r\nsigning of the Burundi peace accord in August this\r\nyear. The peace accord, which was facilitated by\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela, provides a good basis for\r\nresolving the Burundi conflict. We call upon all parties\r\nto respect and implement the agreement so as to bring\r\npeace to that country.\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nIn Angola, it is with apprehension that we bear\r\nwitness to the continuing hostilities and grave\r\nhumanitarian situation brought about by Jonas Savimbi\r\nand his organization, UNITA. We appeal to the\r\nSecurity Council and the international community to\r\nassist the Angolan Government in its efforts to restore\r\npeace and address the worsening humanitarian situation\r\nin that country.\r\nWith regard to Somalia, we welcome the\r\nagreement reached in Djibouti recently on the\r\nformation of the Government of that country. In this\r\nregard, we congratulate the Government of Djibouti for\r\nits constructive role in that process. The new Somalia\r\nwill need the support and assistance of all peace-loving\r\npeople, and of the international community at large.\r\nThere is a direct linkage between conflicts and\r\nthe incidence of refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons. It is estimated that Africa has over 7 million\r\npeople who are refugees and displaced persons.\r\nTanzania is hosting more than 800,000 refugees, most\r\nof whom are products of the crisis in the Great Lakes\r\nregion. In our previous interventions we have stressed\r\nthe need for the international community to increase its\r\nsupport for refugees and for nations hosting refugees.\r\nMoreover, a durable solution to the refugee crisis\r\nentails the resolution of conflicts in the countries of\r\norigin, followed by the repatriation of refugees.\r\nConcerning development assistance to Africa, the\r\nAd Hoc Working Group proposes a number of\r\nmeasures in critical areas such as increasing official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and flows of foreign\r\ndirect investment (FDI), and tackling the debt problem.\r\nIn this context, we should like to reiterate the call on\r\nour development partners to increase ODA flows from\r\nthe current average low level of about 0.25 per cent of\r\ngross national product to the agreed target of 0.7 per\r\ncent. The provision of ODA should be done in tandem\r\nwith an increase in investments. Even though many\r\nAfrican countries have undertaken structural\r\nadjustment programmes and economic reforms, the\r\nflow of FDI has been dismal. There is a need for\r\ninvestors to respond positively to the efforts Africa is\r\nmaking to create an enabling environment for foreign\r\ndirect investment and economic growth.\r\nA solution to the debt burden faced by many\r\nAfrican countries has to be found on an urgent basis.\r\nDebt repayment drains valuable resources from the\r\nrehabilitation and construction of essential\r\ndevelopment infrastructure and programmes aimed at\r\npoverty eradication. We welcome the various debt\r\nrelief measures taken by the donor community,\r\nparticularly the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HPIC) Debt Initiative. However, there is a\r\nneed to relax further the conditionalities attached to\r\nHIPC so as to enable more countries to qualify for\r\nfunding. We further appeal to donors to increase\r\ncontributions to the HIPC Trust Fund so as to respond\r\nto the increased demand for its resources in the HIPC\r\ncountries. My country, in particular, is grateful to the\r\ndonor community, since it is one of the few countries\r\nthat has reached the decision point.\r\nThere is a need to address these issues of\r\nfinancial resources in a more comprehensive fashion so\r\nthat a long-term solution is found for Africa. In this\r\ncontext, we expect that the special concerns of African\r\ncountries will be taken into account at the high-level\r\ninternational intergovernmental conference on\r\nfinancing for development scheduled for 2001.\r\nFor there to be accelerated development in\r\nAfrican countries, the international community should\r\ndirect its support towards the areas of technology\r\ntransfers and education. The widening technological\r\ngap and the deepening digital divide between African\r\ncountries and developed countries have been major\r\nimpediments to development. We therefore call on the\r\ninternational community to strengthen efforts to\r\ntransfer technology to Africa on concessional and grant\r\nterms, including information and environmentally\r\nsound technologies.\r\nFinally, we endorse the Working Group’s\r\nproposal that the General Assembly give particular\r\nattention to the devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic in\r\nAfrica, and that Member States support and actively\r\nparticipate in the various initiatives under way in this\r\nendeavour, including those of the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS.\r\nMr. Mohammad Kamal (Malaysia): First and\r\nforemost, my delegation would like to convey its\r\nsympathies and condolences to the delegation,\r\nGovernment and people of Singapore on the tragic\r\ncrash of the Singapore Airlines aircraft yesterday at\r\nTaipei. We would also like to convey to all the\r\nbereaved families in the other countries affected by the\r\ntragic accident that took the lives of their nationals.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the opportunity this\r\nmorning to address this important agenda item 50, the\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nimportant item on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Malaysia is gratified that\r\nfollowing the report of the Secretary-General on Africa\r\nof April 1998, there has been a tremendous amount of\r\nwork done by the various organs and bodies of the\r\nOrganization to address this issue. We particularly\r\nwelcome the establishment of the Open-ended Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on the Causes of Conflict and the\r\nPromotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa, and congratulate the President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who served as its Chairman.\r\nWe also congratulate the two Vice-Chairmen,\r\nAmbassador Kishore Mahbubani of Singapore and\r\nAmbassador Inocencio Arias of Spain, for their tireless\r\nefforts and for putting together the report of the\r\nWorking Group contained in document A/55/45\r\nfollowing three gruelling sessions during the previous\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation commends the comprehensive\r\nreport of the Ad Hoc Working Group, which contains a\r\nwealth of observations and practical proposals. It is\r\nclear from the report that while much has been\r\nachieved to address the problems besetting Africa,\r\nmuch more still needs to be done in order to overcome\r\nthe many obstacles to the effective implementation of\r\nthe recommendations of the Secretary-General. High\r\non the list of priorities is the need for the international\r\ncommunity to muster the political will to continue to\r\nassist African countries in their development efforts.\r\nClearly, there needs to be an ongoing and dynamic\r\npartnership between the international community and\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nMany a time, we have heard the call for good\r\ngovernance in Africa on the argument that responsible\r\ngovernance brings about political stability, which is\r\nessential for Africa as it seeks to attract external\r\nresources, including foreign direct investment. It is\r\nregrettable that Africa has continued to be besieged by\r\nnumerous armed conflicts, and that perceived risks and\r\ninstability only serve to push donors and investors\r\naway from Africa. We note from the Working Group’s\r\nreport that in spite of some progress on this front, a\r\nnumber of countries in Africa still lack the political\r\nwill to govern responsibly and to implement accords\r\ndesigned to resolve conflicts. Armed conflicts only\r\nserve to harm Africa, and have resulted in more than\r\n8 million Africans becoming refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nIn assisting Africa we should seek ways and\r\nmeans to continue to strengthen the early warning\r\ncapacity of the Organization to respond to conflict\r\nsituations on the continent, as well as the capacities of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\r\nsubregional organizations. The crucial role of African\r\nregional and subregional organizations in the field of\r\npreventive diplomacy and the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes cannot be overemphasized. Undoubtedly, the\r\nOAU, the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates, the Southern African Development Community\r\nand the Intergovernmental Authority for Development\r\nall play important roles in this regard and must be\r\nlauded, encouraged and further assisted in their efforts.\r\nHowever, while we welcome Africa’s\r\ncommitment and its willingness to shoulder increasing\r\nresponsibility for the resolution of its own conflicts, it\r\nis important to ensure that this will not lead to an\r\nabdication by the Security Council of its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The pressing concerns regarding\r\nthis Organization’s involvement in Sierra Leone and in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example,\r\nmust be appropriately and adequately addressed.\r\nThere cannot be peace without development; the\r\ntwo are inextricably linked. With a population of close\r\nto 800 million people, Africa, sadly, remains the\r\nworld’s poorest region. The continent’s growth rate in\r\n1999 was 3 per cent; it was only 2.1 per cent for the\r\nentire decade of the 1990s, well below the estimated\r\n5 per cent gross domestic product growth rate required\r\nto prevent the number of poor people from increasing.\r\nEconomic and social problems are often among the\r\nroot causes of conflicts, and it remains to be seen\r\nwhether the international community is up to the\r\nchallenge to garner the necessary political will to\r\naddress meaningfully the perennial question of\r\nsustaining and enhancing development in Africa.\r\nPoverty eradication should continue to be high on the\r\nagenda, as poverty only impedes efforts at achieving\r\nlong-term peace and security. Crippling external debt,\r\nlimited market access, declining share of foreign direct\r\ninvestment and marginalization from global capital\r\nmarkets owing to a perception of risks and political\r\ninstability, are just some of the other factors that\r\nimpede Africa’s growth.\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nMalaysia joins the call for the international\r\ncommunity to assist Africa in a more sustained fashion\r\nin order to bring about growth, help relieve the\r\nmillions of poor people from poverty, hunger and\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, and to\r\nencourage the peoples of the affected regions in Africa\r\nto fully utilize their potential for a better future.\r\nClearly, Africa continues to need development\r\nassistance. It does not help matters when Africa,\r\nalready marginalized from international private capital\r\nas a result of perceived risks, is further burdened by\r\ndeclining official development assistance. Having\r\nfallen about 24 per cent in real terms since the 1990s,\r\nofficial development assistance and other external\r\nresource inflows are declining at a time when Africa’s\r\nneeds are most pressing. Only a handful of developed\r\ncountries have consistently met or exceeded the target\r\nof 0.7 per cent of gross national product as agreed to at\r\nthe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development. That is indeed regrettable, and\r\nvigorous and committed efforts must be put in place to\r\nreverse this trend.\r\nMalaysia remains convinced that, given the\r\ncomplexity of the issues pertaining to Africa, they must\r\nbe dealt with in a comprehensive, integrated and\r\ncoordinated manner if we are to make a significant\r\nimpact on the situation in Africa. In that regard, we\r\nshare the view that the General Assembly should\r\ncontinue to be responsible for continuing efforts to\r\nmonitor the progress made in the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General in all their\r\naspects, in tandem with efforts made by the other\r\norgans of this Organization, as well as other\r\ninternational institutions.\r\nWe believe that the progress achieved thus far by\r\nAfrica must be sustained and further enhanced to reach\r\nits full potential. As other regions of the world have\r\ndone, Africa must learn from the lessons of the past\r\nand must move forward to brave the challenges of the\r\nnew millennium. Of course, in its present stage of\r\ndevelopment, Africa cannot do it alone. While Africa\r\nmust play its part in the process, it needs, and must\r\nhave, the continued assistance, understanding and\r\ncommitment of the international community. Malaysia\r\nwill continue to make its modest contribution in that\r\nregard.\r\nMr. Mesdoua (Algeria) (spoke in French): I wish\r\nat the outset to convey the condolences of the Algerian\r\ndelegation to the delegations of Angola, the Russian\r\nFederation and Singapore on the loss of life resulting\r\nfrom the air disasters that took place yesterday and\r\ntoday.\r\nThe General Assembly’s consideration of agenda\r\nitem 50, which relates to follow-up to the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/52/871) on the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa, provides an opportunity to\r\nthank the President of the General Assembly and his\r\ncountry, Finland, for their interest in Africa, and to pay\r\ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Theo-\r\nBen Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia,\r\nwho displayed special commitment to keeping Africa\r\nhigh on the list of priorities during his presidency.\r\nIndeed, the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the\r\nCauses of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace\r\nand Sustainable Development in Africa, whose report\r\n(A/55/45) and proposals we are considering today,\r\nreflects his dedication and tireless work on behalf of\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe major work carried out by the Working\r\nGroup is also, and above all, testimony to the high\r\ncommitment of the two Vice-Chairmen, Kishore\r\nMahbubani of Singapore and Inocencio Arias of Spain,\r\nwho embody the spirit of the South-South and North-\r\nSouth partnership that Africa so sorely needs. We\r\nconvey to them our gratitude and our deep appreciation\r\nfor the work they carried out with great skill and spirit.\r\nI wish also to thank the Secretariat for its invaluable\r\nsupport in preparing the report and in facilitating the\r\nwork of the Working Group.\r\nThe Working Group, which the General Assembly\r\nestablished at its fifty-fourth session, has constituted a\r\nspecial approach to following up the implementation of\r\nthe recommendations the Secretary-General made in\r\nhis April 1998 report. Indeed, it has been a unique tool\r\nfor assessment and analysis.\r\nOf course, the relatively brief time at the disposal\r\nof the Working Group and the particularly difficult\r\ncontext in which it was working — relating, inter alia,\r\nto the very heavy workload of the first half of\r\n2000 — made it impossible to consider all\r\nrecommendations and proved a constraint on its\r\nmandate. But despite such constraints, the Working\r\nGroup did a remarkable job of fulfilling its mission. It\r\nwill thus have helped keep Africa at the focal point of\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nthe Organization’s attention — which is another virtue\r\nof the work it has done.\r\nFurthermore, the innovative formula used by the\r\nWorking Group as a result of the very rich interaction\r\nbetween Member States and the agencies, institutions\r\nand programmes of the United Nations system deserves\r\npraise. It might also be beneficial henceforth to apply\r\nthis formula to the various areas on which we will be\r\nfocusing in the future and to extend it to the donor\r\ncommunity. In this context, we believe that it might be\r\nbeneficial if, instead of limiting itself to work carried\r\nout by the United Nations system for the benefit of\r\nAfrica, the Working Group also considered information\r\nabout what the partners are doing.\r\nParagraph 9 of the Working Group’s report shows\r\nthat discernible progress has been achieved in\r\nimplementing the Secretary-General’s recommendations in\r\na wide range of areas. Nonetheless, as paragraph 12 makes\r\nclear, much remains to be done because there are a\r\nnumber of obstacles resulting from political, economic\r\nand social considerations at both the national and the\r\ninternational levels.\r\nIn fact, the main obstacle continues to be the lack\r\nof political will to make the necessary effort to take the\r\nactions that are required in support of peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa. It is true that\r\nresponsibilities are shared, but it is equally true that the\r\ninternational community has unfortunately not yet\r\nprecisely gauged the challenges in Africa.\r\nParagraph 228 of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the organization rightly states:\r\n“Africa continues to face a range of\r\ncomplex and extraordinarily difficult economic,\r\nhealth and security challenges.”\r\nSuch are the tasks and challenges faced by our\r\ncontinent.\r\nIt is true that the situation in Africa continues to\r\nbe of the highest priority for the United Nations. In this\r\ncontext, the commitment of our partners, in the South,\r\nas well as the North, to Africa deserves our\r\nappreciation and encouragement. But this commitment\r\nshould not be absorbed into a plethora of discussions\r\nthat risk causing the international community to lose its\r\nsense of priority and of the need to translate into\r\nconcrete action commitments on behalf of the\r\ncontinent.\r\nMy delegation would like to suggest that the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Working Group pay\r\nparticular attention to four recommendations whose\r\npriority implementation would be a true test of the\r\nsuccess of our work.\r\nThe first relates to the prevention of conflict and\r\nthe maintenance of peace. We would like to reiterate\r\nthe appeal that we have already made, here and\r\nelsewhere in other United Nations bodies, for the more\r\nconsistent involvement of the international community\r\nin the global effort to preserve peace and security on\r\nthe African continent. The universal character of\r\npeacekeeping operations requires all members of the\r\ninternational community — the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations — to show greater solidarity through\r\ntheir consistent participation in United Nations\r\noperations in Africa. Recent developments in the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Sierra Leone unfortunately\r\nreflect a trend towards the regionalization of such\r\noperations in Africa, and this cannot help but have an\r\nadverse affect on Africa and, as a consequence, on\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAfrican States have shown their willingness to\r\nfully assume their responsibilities by taking an\r\nimportant part in keeping the peace on the continent, as\r\nevidenced by the most recent discussions between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, which took place last week in\r\nAlgiers. However, it is obvious that the requirements of\r\nsuch a commitment cannot be met by the means and\r\ncapacities available to African countries.\r\nThe second point is the situation of post-conflict\r\ncountries, for which a very special effort needs to be\r\nmade, by creating conditions to avoid a resurgence of\r\nconflict during the peacekeeping phase. Among other\r\nmeasures, financing programmes for disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and the reintegration of former\r\ncombatants from within the peacekeeping budget, as\r\nrecommended in the Working Group’s conclusions,\r\nwould directly contribute to the success of such\r\nprogrammes. Furthermore, we are pleased to see that\r\nthis essential measure is one of the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Brahimi report.\r\nMy third point relates to debt relief. With regard\r\nto the external debt of African countries, the report of\r\nthe Working Group stresses the drain on valuable and\r\nscarce resources caused by interest payments. This is a\r\nquestion of extreme — indeed, crucial — importance,\r\nand its resolution will have a decisive and definitive\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nimpact on any serious effort to stimulate or develop the\r\nAfrican economy.\r\nMy fourth point — and the fourth proposal in the\r\nreport — relates to the ravages of the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. The damage caused by this pandemic in\r\nAfrica now represents a challenge and a threat to the\r\nstability of many countries in the continent. The record\r\nnumbers, which unfortunately reflect an alarming trend\r\nin this area, require the international community to take\r\nurgent action commensurate with the scale of the\r\nchallenge. The next special session of the General\r\nAssembly on this question, to be held in June 2001,\r\nshould contribute to a qualitative and significant\r\nevolution in the struggle against this pandemic. Africa,\r\nwhich is the region most seriously affected, places\r\ngreat hope on that event.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s initiative, as reflected in\r\nhis report (A/52/871) of April 1998, was both\r\nnecessary and innovative, given the urgent need for the\r\ninternational community to take action to confront the\r\nchallenges and needs identified in that report and\r\nbecause of the approach that it recommends with\r\nregard to the synergy between peace and security on\r\nthe one hand and peace and development on the other.\r\nIt is now up to us to try, together, to identify and\r\ndevelop useful guidelines for future action by the\r\nAssembly to follow-up and encourage the\r\nimplementation of the relevant recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General in order not to disappoint the many\r\nexpectations of our continent.\r\nFor its part, the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) has adopted a vision based on the close\r\nrelationship between peace, security and development.\r\nThe process of the Conference on Security, Stability,\r\nDevelopment and Cooperation in Africa advocates the\r\nsame approach as the Secretary-General in his 1998\r\nreport. We should therefore consider those initiatives as\r\nbeing mutually complementary. Furthermore, it is\r\nextremely important for the OAU to be officially\r\ninvited to contribute to the Working Group by\r\ncommunicating and interacting with it.\r\nOne year after the Working Group was created,\r\nwe must jointly identify and agree on useful future\r\nactivities on the part of the General Assembly to\r\nfollow-up the implementation of the relevant\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General. In this\r\ncontext, Algeria believes that the mandate of the\r\nWorking Group should be renewed under the authority\r\nof the President of the General Assembly. Future action\r\nfor the Working Group, as well as specific topics on\r\nwhich it should focus, could be the subject of\r\nconsultations and agreement among Member States,\r\nfacilitated by the President of the General Assembly.\r\nWe believe that we should also involve the two Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Working Group in this activity.\r\nThe Working Group, as proposed in its report,\r\nshould establish thematic working groups, coordinated\r\nby Member States, to review in greater depth questions\r\nthat were not analysed sufficiently during the last\r\nsession.\r\nOne important aspect of the follow-up to the\r\nimplementation of the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations has to do with the evaluation tools\r\nthat the Working Group will need to examine. It would\r\nbe useful for one of the thematic subgroups to focus on\r\nthe definition of parameters and indicators to help it\r\nmeasure the progress achieved. Likewise, the\r\ncomplementarity between the various organs of the\r\nOrganization, be it the Security Council or the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, is also of the greatest\r\nimportance. Greater coordination is needed to improve\r\nconsistency in this regard.\r\nAs the Working Group has requested, it would be\r\ndesirable for the Assembly to receive periodically all\r\ninterim reports issued by the Secretary-General on\r\nfollow-up to the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations in his report.\r\nFollowing the adoption of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration at the unique and historic Summit of world\r\nleaders, we express the wish that the specific\r\ncommitments taken in support of Africa will not\r\nsimply remain mere declarations of intent, without\r\naction.\r\nFinally, I pay special tribute to our partners in\r\nAfrica, both in the South and the North, and especially\r\nto the European Union, whose participation in the\r\nWorking Group has been continuous, useful and top-\r\nnotch.\r\nMy delegation hopes that future discussions will\r\nenable other partners, within and outside the United\r\nNations, to show their interest in and attention to\r\nAfrican concerns.\r\nMr. Chitharanjan (India): We convey our\r\nheartfelt condolences and sympathy to Singapore and\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nto all of the bereaved families affected by the tragic\r\ndisaster yesterday of Singapore Airlines.\r\nI begin by congratulating the Permanent\r\nRepresentatives of Singapore and Spain, whose\r\ndedication and commitment to the work of the most\r\nimportant Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group of the\r\nGeneral Assembly led to the successful adoption of its\r\nreport by consensus. We support the extension of its\r\nmandate and look forward to continued active and\r\nconstructive participation in its work, which we hope\r\nwill result in concrete action to effectively support the\r\nefforts of the African countries themselves directed\r\ntowards economic growth, prosperity and the well-\r\nbeing of their peoples.\r\nAfrica’s problems are not unique. They are not\r\nproblems because they are African. They are problems\r\nthat have bedevilled countries in similar situations, in\r\nEurope and elsewhere, many times before. The\r\nsolutions to these problems, therefore, have to be the\r\nsame as were found for Europe after 1945 — namely,\r\naid, development, trade and cooperation. The crucial\r\ndifference is that, while a devastated Europe received a\r\ngenerous and sustained infusion of capital under the\r\nMarshall plan, resurgent Africa has seen prospects for\r\nits development and growth denied by a paucity of\r\nfinancial resources. The totality of this challenge needs\r\nto be addressed comprehensively, effectively and\r\nurgently.\r\nWe are satisfied that the Millennium Declaration\r\ndecided to support the consolidation of democracy in\r\nAfrica and to assist African countries in their struggle\r\nfor lasting peace, poverty eradication and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The resolve of our leaders, shown in\r\nparagraph 27 of the Millennium Declaration, is clear;\r\nthe international community’s approach should be\r\nguided by the spirit of learning from Africa, to help\r\nitself by helping Africa and not to preach the\r\n“perceived wisdom” which seeks to guide development\r\ncooperation today. Conditionalities of any sort would\r\nonly worsen the situation.\r\nWe strongly believe that Africa’s efforts towards\r\neradicating poverty are predicated on the twin factors\r\nof sustained economic growth and external financing.\r\nAccording to the publication World Economic Situation\r\nand Prospects for 2000, African economies grew by\r\n3 per cent in 1999, recording a marginal increase over\r\nthe 2.8 per cent economic growth rate of 1998.\r\nNotwithstanding this improvement, economic growth\r\nover the last decade in Africa has been neither strong\r\nenough nor sustained enough to increase per capita\r\nincome and to achieve a substantial and sustained\r\nreduction in poverty levels. It has been estimated that\r\n44 per cent of Africans in the continent as a whole and\r\n51 per cent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa\r\nlive in absolute poverty. Annual gross domestic\r\nproduct (GDP) growth rate of between 7 per cent and 8\r\nper cent would be required to halve poverty by 2015.\r\nWithout growth there cannot be any increase in\r\nhousehold or government spending, in private or public\r\ncapital formation, in health or social welfare.\r\nThe question before us, therefore, is how to\r\nachieve these growth rates. Another report (A/55/350)\r\nsubmitted to this Millennium Assembly has estimated\r\nthat an annual investment of 30 per cent to 40 per cent\r\nof GDP is required. With a current domestic saving rate\r\nof around 18 per cent, it is clear that at least 22 per cent\r\nof Africa’s GDP should be provided annually by\r\nrequired external resources. In July this year the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), in its report entitled Capital Flows and\r\nGrowth in Africa, said that the only feasible way to end\r\nthe aid dependence of Africa is to launch a massive aid\r\nprogramme to sustained rapid growth for a sufficiently\r\nlong period. It estimated that a doubling of aid flow for\r\nsub-Saharan Africa of $22 billion a year would amount\r\nto no more than an increase of five United States cents\r\nto every hundred dollars of consumer spending in\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) countries — surely not big\r\nnumbers.\r\nThe issue of debt cancellation deserves special\r\nconsideration. High ratios of external debt to GDP and\r\na high debt service ratio continue to characterize\r\nseveral African countries. Clearly, deteriorating social\r\nspending is largely due to rising claims of interest\r\npayments on public debt. In many African countries,\r\nper capita external debt is twice the yearly income.\r\nAfrica’s debt has increased from $344 billion in 1997\r\nto $359 billion in 1999; debt service as a percentage of\r\nexport of goods and services has been continuously\r\nincreasing, from 21.3 per cent in 1997 to 28.7 per cent\r\nin 1998 and to 30 per cent last year.\r\nAccording to almost all measures, despite the\r\nhigh media-visibility debt-relief initiatives, the burden\r\nof African countries has been worsening. Many of\r\nthem have been trapped in a debt cycle whereby new\r\naid is given to service existing debt stock. For sub-\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nSaharan Africa as a whole, arrears on interest payments\r\non long-term debt accumulated from 1989 to 1998 are\r\nover $13 billion, or 14 per cent of the current account\r\ndeficit. The United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) estimates that 19,000 children die every day in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa because money has to be spent on\r\ndebt repayments and debt-servicing rather than basic\r\nhealth care. This is clearly unacceptable. Additional\r\nresources, apart from official development assistance\r\n(ODA), are urgently required to finance fully the\r\nenvisaged debt cancellation.\r\nWe are happy that the international conference on\r\nfinancing for development will focus on issues related\r\nto African development. We would like to make only\r\nthree points.\r\nFirst, on the issue of domestic mobilization of\r\nresources, in these subsistence-level economies,\r\ninstead of stressing domestic resource mobilization, the\r\ninternational community should concentrate on\r\ninternational actions to meet the 22 per cent financing\r\ngap.\r\nSecondly, it is abundantly clear that the overall\r\nincrease in private capital flows to developing\r\ncountries has largely bypassed Africa. In 1999, Africa\r\nattracted only $8.6 billion in foreign direct investment\r\n(FDI) portfolio, of the total $192 billion invested in all\r\nthe developing countries. This underlines the need for\r\ncapital exporting countries to eliminate any\r\nrestrictions, formal or informal, on investments in\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nThirdly, there is the most important issue of the\r\nreturn of capital that has been removed from these\r\ncountries and squirrelled away. Capital flight remains\r\npervasive; it was estimated to be approximately equal\r\nto Africa’s external debt stock at the end of 1990s, at\r\naround $350 billion. The situation is complicated by\r\nthe unwillingness of the foreign Governments in whose\r\nbanks lies the preponderant portion of these massive\r\namounts to make efforts to return this capital to those\r\nto whom it rightly belongs — the people of Africa.\r\nAfrica urgently and desperately needs these funds, not\r\nonly for development, but also to further its valiant\r\nefforts to staunch corruption and ensure that the bribes\r\nof a corrupt international economic system do not\r\nimpair the development of the honest people of Africa.\r\nCan we take effective steps to address this issue?\r\nTwo years ago, the Secretary-General emphasised\r\nthe importance of export-led growth for Africa. It is\r\nclaimed by some that economic growth in 1999 was\r\nessentially export-led and that gross domestic product\r\n(GDP) growth in 2000 is expected to increase to\r\n4.2 per cent, largely due to an anticipated increase in\r\nthe value of exports to 11.5 per cent this year.\r\nHowever, African countries are basically primary\r\nproduce exporters that have suffered sharp\r\ndeteriorations in the terms of trade. Tariff peaks and\r\ntariff escalation, as well as agricultural support policies\r\nand restrictive agricultural safeguards of Organization\r\nfor Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries,\r\nseverely impede the development of export-oriented\r\ngrowth of many African countries. After all, how can a\r\nfarmer in Africa effectively compete with his Western\r\ncounterpart when the latter received an average annual\r\nsubsidy of $25,000 in 1996 and when the OECD\r\ncountries spend the equivalent of more than Africa’s\r\ntotal GDP to subsidize their farmers? In fact, it has\r\nbeen variously estimated that, as a result of the\r\nUruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations,\r\nAfrica stands to lose up to $1.2 billion every year.\r\nEffective action must be taken to redress this situation.\r\nI have a few points of detail on the report of the\r\nWorking Group. We strongly suggest, with regard to\r\nparagraph 9 (d), on the impact of refugees, that the role\r\nof the United Nations Development Programme in this,\r\nand indeed other areas, must be guided by the\r\nprinciples of operational activities, and must not be a\r\nstrain on its primary role — assisting developing\r\ncountries in their national development priorities.\r\nFurthermore, we note from paragraph 17 that\r\n“tied aid has reduced the effectiveness and\r\namount of aid available for use within the\r\nrecipient countries.”\r\nWe would, of course, have hoped that the Assembly\r\nwould go beyond this, to ask for a complete untying of\r\naid as the single most important factor in enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of aid. Tied aid makes a mockery of the\r\nrecent talk of giving recipients a bigger stake in\r\nmaking a success of aid projects — letting them own\r\nthem, in the jargon, or as a donor was recently heard to\r\nsay in an African country, “Yes, of course, they must\r\nown the projects. We will force them to do it. However,\r\nour people back home would be more comfortable if\r\nour national was in charge, since vast amounts of\r\ntaxpayers’ money are being spent. If they do not like it,\r\nthey can get their money elsewhere.” This must cease.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nFinally, we should eschew the propensity to look\r\nat Africa as a homogenous entity with the same\r\nproblems in all its countries. Obviously, there can be\r\nno universal blueprint, and policies have to be tailored\r\nby each recipient country to meet its specific structural\r\nand economic needs. Our role should be to assist,\r\nwhere we can make a difference, in the actual\r\nimplementation of the choices made by the African\r\ncountries themselves.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Norway welcomes the\r\nopportunity once again to discuss the follow-up of the\r\nimportant report (A/52/871) of the Secretary-General\r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa, which in\r\nApril 1998 was submitted to the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nRegrettably, there are still several serious\r\nconflicts in Africa, and the continent continues to lag\r\nbehind the rest of the world in economic and social\r\ndevelopment. According to a United Nations report to\r\nthe Economic and Social Council session this summer,\r\nAfrica’s economy in 1999 grew by an estimated 3.2 per\r\ncent, and during the last decade the continent’s annual\r\naverage growth was only 2.1 per cent, while the yearly\r\npopulation increase was 2.8 per cent. This means that\r\neconomic growth is not keeping pace with the growth\r\nin population and that most African countries are far\r\nbehind the 7 per cent annual growth rate required to\r\nreduce poverty by half by 2015. The slow growth of\r\nthe African economy is one of the main obstacles to\r\nachieving sustainable development and improving the\r\nliving conditions of the majority of the African people.\r\nArmed conflicts are a major reason for the slow\r\neconomic growth in a large number of African\r\ncountries. Here we all have a responsibility, as the\r\nSecretary-General pointed out in his report two years\r\nago. There is therefore an urgent need for a stronger\r\ncommitment both from the African countries and their\r\nleaders and from the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community at large. Together we need to\r\ntake decisive steps to prevent and resolve such\r\nconflicts.\r\nNorway believes that speedy and efficient\r\nimplementation of the recommendations in the report\r\n(A/55/305) of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations, the so-called Brahimi report, would\r\nconstitute one such step. We also believe it is important\r\nto take further steps to strengthen the mechanisms for\r\ncooperation in peacekeeping and peace-building\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), as well as with African\r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nNorway will continue its efforts to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations capacity for peacekeeping and conflict\r\nprevention, and to support the Trust Fund for\r\nPreventive Action. We will also continue our support\r\nfor the OAU and its Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution.\r\nWe note with appreciation that important progress\r\nhas recently been made with regard to resolving some\r\nof the ongoing conflicts in Africa. It is, however,\r\nimportant that such progress be followed up with the\r\nnecessary commitment and political will by the\r\npolitical leaders concerned to implement peace accords\r\nand other measures required to ensure that the\r\nexpectations of peace and reconciliation are attained.\r\nOnly then may the international community be able to\r\nprovide the necessary resources to create a basis for\r\nsustainable development.\r\nPoverty is both a cause and an effect of conflicts\r\nand is endemic to many parts of Africa. Poverty\r\neradication must therefore be one of our main priorities\r\nin the work for durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. The ongoing efforts in many\r\ncountries to develop their own strategies for poverty\r\nreduction should be actively supported. In this context,\r\nit is also important to ensure proper coordination\r\nbetween the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies in order to streamline\r\ntheir activities and create maximum complementarity\r\nand synergy.\r\nFurthermore, bilateral donors should ensure that\r\ntheir activities are well coordinated with the work of\r\nthe multilateral institutions and within an overall\r\nframework defined by the recipient countries\r\nthemselves. It is also important that we stand by our\r\ncommitments as far as development assistance is\r\nconcerned. The Norwegian Government is determined\r\nto go beyond the current 0.9 per cent of our gross\r\nnational product devoted to official development\r\nassistance to reach 1 per cent. We are also committed\r\nto giving priority in our development cooperation to\r\nAfrica. In order to ensure the best possible\r\ninternational coordination, we shall increase\r\nsignificantly our development assistance allocated\r\nthrough the United Nations agencies. Norway is\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nalready by far the largest per capita contributor to the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\nwe shall further expand our cooperation with UNDP\r\nboth for poverty reduction and in relation to good\r\ngovernance and post-conflict management. Norway\r\nwill also continue to give high priority to the ongoing\r\nwork to alleviate the heavy debt burden of many\r\nAfrican countries. We encourage all creditor countries\r\nto seek ways to give the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative a new start.\r\nHealth is an essential factor for development. It is\r\na tragic fact that more than 23 million Africans today\r\nlive with HIV/AIDS, and the economies of many\r\nAfrican countries are seriously threatened by the\r\nepidemic. If unchecked, it is estimated that HIV/AIDS\r\nover the next 20 years may reduce the economies of\r\nsub-Saharan Africa by a fourth. In some of the hard-hit\r\ncountries, life expectancy has already been reduced by\r\nas much as 20 years. HIV/AIDS now constitutes one of\r\nthe most serious threats to sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. The Norwegian Government has therefore\r\ndecided to double the funding for HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes and to give priority to this issue in our\r\ncooperation with all our development partners. We also\r\nlook forward to the upcoming United Nations special\r\nsession scheduled for next June to take stock and agree\r\non new and strengthened action in this field.\r\nNorway will also increase significantly its\r\ncontribution to combat tuberculosis and other\r\npreventable diseases prevalent in many parts of Africa.\r\nWe have recently pledged $110 million to the Global\r\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization in order to\r\nsave and protect the health of some 25 million poor\r\nchildren who annually fail to receive immunization\r\nagainst easily preventable diseases. We believe this to\r\nbe a cost-effective tool in the fight against poverty.\r\nEconomic growth and sustainable development\r\nwill not be possible without investments. In order to\r\nachieve a gross domestic product growth rate of 7 per\r\ncent per annum, it is estimated that sub-Saharan Africa\r\nwill require an investment rate of 40 per cent compared\r\nto the current rate of 17 per cent. This will be possible\r\nonly through the much more active involvement of the\r\nprivate sector. For this reason, Norway, in cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment, has decided to invite all least developed\r\ncountries to a conference in Oslo next January to\r\ndiscuss the role of the private sector in our war against\r\npoverty.\r\nIt should, however, be underlined that\r\ninvestments and economic growth do not occur in a\r\nvacuum. Peace and stability are a basic prerequisite for\r\npotential investors. There is also a need for transparent\r\nand accountable Governments and for the security of\r\npersonal freedom and private property — in short, for\r\ngood governance and respect for human rights. This is\r\nwhere many African countries so far have not fulfilled\r\ntheir obligations. The need for good governance is our\r\ncommon challenge — for the African countries\r\nthemselves and for the international community.\r\nIt is therefore important that we all make a\r\nrenewed, coordinated and sustained effort to promote\r\npeace and development on the African continent.\r\nConflict prevention and conflict resolution should go\r\nhand in hand with humanitarian aid and development\r\nefforts. We must also deal with the root causes of the\r\nconflicts and not just the symptoms. Effective crisis\r\nmanagement must therefore include promoting long-\r\nterm and sustainable development, combating poverty\r\nand relieving poor countries of their unsustainable debt\r\nburden, as well as promoting democratic and economic\r\nreforms.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMy delegation wishes to participate in the discussion\r\non this item in order to support the work and\r\nrecommendations submitted to the Assembly by the\r\nOpen-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the Causes of\r\nConflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and\r\nSustainable Development in Africa.\r\nWe should like to express our gratitude to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, and to the\r\nVice-Chairmen of the Working Group, the\r\nAmbassadors of Spain and Singapore, for the excellent\r\nmanner in which they conducted the deliberations, for\r\nthe open dialogue they promoted and for their skill in\r\nguiding our work.\r\nThe goal of durable peace in Africa is the\r\nprofound aspiration of all members of the international\r\ncommunity, especially the peoples of Africa\r\nthemselves, who today are suffering the effects of\r\nconflict on a daily basis. We must consider the work of\r\nthe Working Group as a contribution to this aspiration\r\nto peace in Africa because it has allowed us to focus on\r\nthe causes of conflict, to discuss relief for the\r\npopulations and to consider how we should all act in\r\norder to produce the best possible outcome.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to highlight\r\nsome of the initiatives outlined in the report of the\r\nWorking Group and to link them to recent\r\ndevelopments in support of peace and development in\r\nAfrica.\r\nFirst are the pan-African initiatives. We welcome\r\nwith great satisfaction two recent African initiatives\r\nthat demonstrate the determination of African countries\r\nto overcome adverse conditions and to restore peace to\r\nthe continent. One was the decision to establish the\r\nAfrican Economic Community, adopted by the heads of\r\nState and Government of the Organization of African\r\nUnity last July as a platform to build a better future and\r\na foundation of unity among its diverse peoples. The\r\nother was the plan of action adopted in Abuja in May\r\nthis year at the African Ministerial Conference on\r\nSecurity, Stability, Development and Cooperation in\r\nAfrica. It deserves the broadest possible international\r\nsupport.\r\nSecondly, there are the measures taken within the\r\nUnited Nations system. The United Nations organs\r\nhave been cooperating with the countries of Africa in\r\nvarious ways that have been highlighted in the\r\npresentations made by various agencies to the Working\r\nGroup. They are also reflected in the document on\r\nagreed conclusions issued last year by the Economic\r\nand Social Council. We are pleased that the high-level\r\nsegment of the Council’s substantive session next year\r\nwill be devoted specifically to the development of\r\nAfrica.\r\nLet me also highlight the decision of the\r\nSecretary-General taken in April 2000 to establish a\r\ntask force between United Nations agencies, headed by\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to\r\nrespond to the problems of food security and\r\nagricultural development in the Horn of Africa where\r\nthese factors have had a negative bearing on peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe also believe that the significance given in the\r\nreport of the Ad Hoc Working Group to measures on\r\nbehalf of post-conflict countries is very appropriate.\r\nConsequently, we support the recommendation that the\r\nGeneral Assembly ask the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to establish a special consultative group to\r\nreview the economic needs of these countries in order\r\nto provide them with support programmes to help them\r\nrecover successfully. The needs of these countries are\r\nvery special, and their institutions are still very fragile.\r\nReceiving a critical mass of resources on a timely basis\r\ncould give them the definitive thrust that would make it\r\npossible for them to overcome their difficulties.\r\nWe also applaud that on 4 September, under the\r\npresidency of Mali, the Security Council held a\r\nmeeting involving the heads of State and Government\r\nof its members in order to discuss promoting peace on\r\nthe African continent. We hope to show our firm\r\nsupport for this idea during our participation on the\r\nCouncil for the next two years starting on 1 January\r\n2001.\r\nThirdly, there are measures on foreign debt and\r\ninternational trade. The disproportionate weight of\r\nexternal debt continues to be one of the main concerns\r\nof the African countries. It is obvious that the highly\r\nindebted poor countries should be accorded special\r\nattention on the part of their creditors and the\r\ninternational financial institutions in order to attempt to\r\ncancel their debt.\r\nAnother series of measures would apply to\r\ncountries that cannot benefit from the current\r\ninitiatives as a way of relieving their debt. And yet\r\nanother category of measures would seek to benefit\r\nmiddle-income debtor countries that are interested in\r\navoiding long-term debt sustainability problems.\r\nWhen it comes to international trade and\r\ninvestments, we are pleased to note the results of the\r\nvery important Africa-Europe Summit held in Cairo\r\nthis year, as well as the signing of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement last June that will guide commercial\r\ncooperation and economic links among the African,\r\nCaribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and the European\r\nUnion.\r\nFourthly and finally is the matter of the future\r\nwork of the Ad Hoc Working Group. We believe that\r\nthe way that this Group has done its work is good, but\r\nwe believe that improvements would be possible. We\r\nwould have preferred to have more time to look at\r\nsome other aspects having to do with causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa — for instance, measures to\r\nsupport countries that have received many refugees or\r\nthose that have to respond to the urgent needs of\r\ninternally displaced persons.\r\nWe would therefore like to recommend that the\r\nmandate of the Ad Hoc Working Group be extended so\r\nthat it may continue evaluating the implementation of\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nthe recommendations made by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report on Africa of 1998. Its work should help the\r\npreparations for the high-level segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council next year and the final\r\nevaluation in 2002 of the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s initiative.\r\nMr. Al-Awdi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): It gives\r\nmy delegation pleasure to participate in the discussion\r\nof the item on the “Causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa”. We in Kuwait believe that our\r\nfriends in the African continent deserve our support\r\nhere at the United Nations, in parallel to our constant\r\nsupport in the field.\r\nMy delegation has followed the serious\r\ndiscussions in the United Nations on African issues\r\nsince 1997 within the Security Council and since 1998\r\nin the General Assembly when this item was included\r\nin the agenda of the Assembly. We have been\r\nadvocating a very clear fact — that this concern and all\r\npositive proposals need to be sustainable and\r\nimplementable in the field so that they can alleviate the\r\nsuffering of our brethren on the African continent. My\r\ndelegation believes that chapter VII of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) on the African continent\r\nwould be the last theoretical measure that we can adopt\r\nhere at the United Nations. The only way to confirm\r\nthe credibility of the United Nations and the keenness\r\nof its members to achieve stability in the continent is\r\nthe adoption of implementable and practical measures\r\nthat would realize objectives such as the elimination of\r\npoverty as well as other social problems in Africa.\r\nSuch problems play an important role in\r\nfomenting conflicts in Africa. My delegation has\r\nactively followed the work of the Open-ended Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on the Causes of Conflict in Africa. In\r\nthis respect, we cannot fail to pay tribute to the\r\nlaudable efforts of the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nGroup, Ambassador Mahbubani of Singapore and\r\nAmbassador Arias of Spain, and their Mission staff in\r\nthe highly organized and transparent way in which they\r\nconducted the work of this Working Group.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its full\r\nsupport for most of the items in the report of this\r\nWorking Group, including the extension of its mandate\r\nfor the coming session. After reviewing the work of the\r\nWorking Group and all the reports of the United\r\nNations on the causes of conflict in Africa, we in\r\nKuwait have reached some primary convictions of\r\nwhich we highlight the following:\r\nFirst, we would like to emphasize the importance\r\nof entrusting the follow-up for all the political and\r\ndevelopment efforts in the African continent to one\r\norgan inside the United Nations and to coordinate\r\ninternational efforts inside and outside the United\r\nNations system in order to guarantee best use of the\r\nefforts and assistance provided to African States in\r\ndifferent fields.\r\nSecondly, the role of the African States is\r\nconsidered a critical and decisive factor in realizing the\r\nviable and durable stability in the African continent. In\r\nthis regard, we welcome the convening of an African\r\nministerial conference on security, stability,\r\ndevelopment and cooperation in Africa, which would\r\nbe a way to convince the world that the African\r\ncontinent is seriously working to create favourable and\r\nstable circumstances for the development process.\r\nThirdly, we share the view in the Report of the\r\nWorking Group stating that the political will for the\r\nsolution of the African question must be provided by\r\nthree main parties: the African States, the United\r\nNations and the donor countries.\r\nFourthly, we would like to emphasize\r\nconcentrating on the development of the human\r\nresources in Africa and to encourage those good\r\nAfricans, who as we in Kuwait know very well, are\r\ncapable of rising up to the challenges on the continent.\r\nFifthly, debt burden relief for African countries is\r\nvital in assisting the continent to reinvest any\r\ndisbursements and assistance in the development\r\ndomain.\r\nSixthly, we must steer away from complicated\r\ndevelopment programmes that are not commensurate\r\nwith actual reality in Africa. Such plans would require\r\nhuge financial resources. We must otherwise\r\nconcentrate on implementing easy plans that aim at\r\neliminating poverty, promoting education and\r\nincreasing awareness of the concepts of peace and law.\r\nKuwait has always been keen in its foreign policy\r\non speaking and moving within its actual capacity to\r\nassist. Development assistance to friendly countries is\r\nconsidered one of the pillars of Kuwaiti foreign policy,\r\nwhich we implement in good will and within the\r\nframework of implementing South-South cooperation.\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nThis was made clear by the 1991 initiative of His\r\nRoyal Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber\r\nAl-Sabah, who wrote off the interest accrued on least\r\ndeveloped countries’ debts, including African\r\ncountries, in addition to assistance provided by the\r\nKuwaiti fund for Arab economic development, which\r\nprovides low-interest loans to African countries.\r\nA cursory look at the report of the Kuwait fund\r\nfor the year 2000 shows the volume of Kuwaiti\r\ndevelopment assistance through the fund to countries in\r\nEast, Central, West and southern Africa until 1999.\r\nThis assistance by Kuwait amounted to 17 per cent of\r\nthe total world development assistance to various\r\ncountries of the world. Six hundred and sixty-two\r\nextremely low interest loans were given to African\r\nStates, totalling in value $1,000,600,000.\r\nWe hope that the coming years will not find us\r\ntalking about African issues as a bad example of the\r\ngloomy realities prevailing in our world, or to give\r\ncredence to the voice of doom preaching the\r\nuselessness and inefficiency of the United Nations. We\r\nmust take it upon ourselves to make our approach to\r\nsettle African problems a positive example to be\r\nemulated in the future. It should underscore the ability\r\nof the United Nations and its Member States to face up\r\nto the challenges of the new century.\r\nMr. Shahid (Bangladesh): Bangladesh\r\nparticipates in this debate with a great sense of pride\r\nand commitment: pride because of the indomitable\r\nspirit of the African people, which has always\r\nenergized us; commitment because we believe in the\r\ncause of peace and development in Africa.\r\nIt is from this perspective that Bangladesh\r\nwholeheartedly welcomes the report of the Open-ended\r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Causes of Conflict and\r\nthe Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa. We note in particular and with\r\nappreciation the progress made in the implementation\r\nof the recommendations contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report in document A/52/871. We believe\r\nthat the recommendations of the Secretary-General are\r\nto be pursued further, both within Africa and by the\r\ninternational community at large, with a view to\r\neliminating the roots of conflict through a variety of\r\nsustained economic and social measures.\r\nBangladesh welcomes the initiatives taken by the\r\nSecurity Council with regard to Africa and believes\r\nthat a comprehensive response to Africa’s complex and\r\ninterrelated security and development challenges is\r\nneeded. We urge the General Assembly and other\r\nUnited Nations bodies, regional organizations, the\r\ninternational financial institutions and Member States\r\nto consider the recommendations of the Open-ended\r\nAd Hoc Working Group. We also call upon them to\r\ntake appropriate actions of their own. We strongly\r\nbelieve that these recommendations can give a new\r\nmomentum to peace and development in Africa.\r\nWe fully share the view expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report that the prevention of\r\nconflict begins and ends with the promotion of human\r\nsecurity and human development. As in other places,\r\nconflicts in Africa have their roots in social\r\ndiscrimination, economic deprivation and lack of\r\naccountability in the use of political power. At the\r\nsame time, we believe that the colonial legacy and its\r\ncontinuation in different forms and manifestations are\r\nstill at work, preventing social and political\r\nassimilation and equitable distribution of resources,\r\nwhich foments tensions and conflicts within and among\r\nnations. There is little justification for lamenting the\r\nhuman and material loss in the conflicts in Africa and\r\nelsewhere when political divisions in every society are\r\nfeeding today’s violence. Prevention is always better\r\nthan cure. The Secretary-General has already\r\nreaffirmed this idea in the context of the African\r\nsituation. We share this conviction and, therefore,\r\nsupport his suggestion that the international community\r\nshould encourage the concerned Governments to seek\r\npolitical solutions to conflict situations by working\r\nthrough special mediators and commissioners.\r\nWe find useful the suggestions contained in\r\npart IV of the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group for\r\naddressing the overall mechanism and frameworks to\r\nensure peace, security and development in Africa. The\r\nreport outlines the areas in which action is to be taken\r\nat the national and international level. We believe that\r\nno domestic efforts can be successful in the developing\r\ncountries, in Africa in particular, unless these are\r\nmatched equally by international support. In this\r\ncontext, my delegation fully supports the\r\nrecommendation made in the report that calls for\r\ncancellation on a once-and-for-all basis, where\r\nappropriate, of the debt of the least developed African\r\ncountries, including those emerging from conflicts. My\r\ndelegation shares the concern expressed in the report\r\non the inadequacy of contributions to the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative Trust\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nFund and calls upon the donor countries to the HIPC\r\nTrust Fund to make their contributions available. My\r\ndelegation also calls upon creditor countries to make a\r\nfirm commitment to take action to write off the HIPC\r\ndebt in a timely way, consistent with the urgent need\r\nfor poverty eradication and enhanced economic growth\r\nin Africa.\r\nBangladesh’s commitment to the well-being of\r\nour brothers and sisters in Africa is rooted in a number\r\nof compelling factors. Bangladesh has been a major\r\ncontributor in almost all United Nations peacekeeping\r\nand peacemaking efforts on the African continent. I\r\nwould also like to mention that, under the leadership of\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the\r\nparticipation of Bangladesh in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations has increased manifold. We\r\nhave together pursued a similar line of struggle for our\r\nindependence and still share similar values of life and\r\noutlooks on the contemporary global situation. On the\r\neconomic front, most of the African countries are least\r\ndeveloped countries, the group of which Bangladesh\r\nhas the honour to coordinate. We therefore share\r\ncommon experience and common goals in our struggle\r\nto foster a stable social order, economic development\r\nand political independence to make life meaningful for\r\nour people. Let me reaffirm our commitment to see a\r\nconflict-free Africa contributing to global peace,\r\nsecurity and development in a meaningful way.\r\nMr. Ahmad (Pakistan): My first word, on behalf\r\nof my delegation, must be one of sympathy and\r\ncondolence to the Government and people of Singapore\r\nat the tragic loss of life in the Singapore Airlines crash\r\nyesterday.\r\nReverting to the item under discussion, I would\r\nlike, at the outset, to express our appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Kishore Mahbubani of Singapore and\r\nAmbassador Arias of Spain, the two Vice-Chairmen of\r\nthe Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the Causes\r\nof Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and\r\nSustainable Development in Africa for effectively\r\npresenting the deliberations of the Working Group and\r\nproviding us with an excellent report.\r\nWe would also like to associate ourselves with\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Nigeria on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe challenges faced by Africa are well known.\r\nThe objectives of achieving peace and prosperity in\r\nAfrica have been on the priority list of the United\r\nNations and the international community for over a\r\ndecade. The number of programmes of action adopted\r\non Africa is perhaps higher than the number of such\r\nprogrammes adopted for any other region of the world.\r\nYet, the overall situation of the African continent has\r\nnot improved over the last two decades. Poverty,\r\ndisease, famine, lack of human resource development,\r\nexternal debt burden, conflict and strife remain the\r\nmajor obstacles to development in Africa.\r\nThese are fundamental challenges but not\r\ninsurmountable ones. The maladies of\r\nunderdevelopment are not peculiar to Africa. Many\r\nregions of the world have overcome these difficulties\r\nand so can Africa. It is encouraging to know that some\r\nprogress has been made in the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations made in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/52/871), which was released in April 1998.\r\nIn this context, the launching of the African Ministerial\r\nConference on Security, Stability, Development and\r\nCooperation in Africa within the framework of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity is a laudable effort\r\ninitiated by the countries of the region.\r\nThe international community must lend its full\r\nsupport to regional and national efforts for the\r\nachievement of the twin goals of peace and\r\ndevelopment. Africa alone cannot meet these\r\nchallenges, in fact no region or nation can do so on its\r\nown. We need to assist Africa in addressing the root\r\ncauses of conflicts. This requires a concerted\r\ninternational effort at two levels. In the first instance,\r\nthere is a need to focus on the underlying political and\r\nsecurity aspects of instability in that continent. In\r\nparallel, economic and social problems afflicting parts\r\nof Africa need to be tackled through a comprehensive\r\nassistance programme with adequate resources. But\r\nassistance loses its value, both real and moral, if it is\r\nmotivated by conditionalities or political\r\nconsiderations. Neither peace nor development should\r\nbe held hostage to ransom.\r\nPakistan has consistently supported United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations in Africa. We have\r\nparticipated on a large scale in these operations. Our\r\nmilitary and civilian personnel have been part of\r\nUnited Nations operations in the Democratic Republic\r\nof Congo, Liberia, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and\r\nWestern Sahara. We have a binding commitment to our\r\npartnership with Africa. Like in the past, Pakistan will\r\nalso continue to lend its moral and material support to\r\nthe development efforts of African countries. Our\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nTechnical Assistance Programme for Africa is an\r\nongoing process of training young professionals in\r\ndiverse fields. As soon as the South Institute of\r\nInformation Technology is established, we will be in a\r\nposition to offer special training facilities in\r\ninformational technology for students from Africa.\r\nWe are all committed to the cause of the\r\ndevelopment of Africa. Despite this commitment, one\r\nof the major obstacles to the effective implementation\r\nof the recommendations of the Secretary-General has\r\nbeen identified as the lack of political will. We have to\r\nre-galvanize our efforts and rededicate ourselves to\r\nbringing this continent out of the quagmire of poverty\r\nand underdevelopment.\r\nWithout enhanced official development\r\nassistance, increased investment, a durable solution of\r\nthe external debt burden, market access to products and\r\nservices from the African region, integration of the\r\nAfrican countries into the global economy, efforts for\r\nthe achievement of the goals of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development are not likely to make any\r\nimpact.\r\nHuman resource development remains a major\r\nchallenge for African countries. Special programmes\r\nshould be launched for capacity-building, as well as for\r\npromoting education and literacy. The international\r\ncommunity should strengthen efforts to transfer\r\ntechnology to Africa on concessional and preferential\r\nterms.\r\nThe Working Group has provided us with a\r\nnumber of important action-oriented recommendations\r\nto achieve the twin goals of peace and development in\r\nAfrica. The international community, particularly the\r\nUnited Nations system, should take all necessary\r\nmeasures to implement the proposals contained in the\r\nreport.\r\nWe believe that the high-level segment of the\r\n2001 substantive session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil devoted to the development of Africa could\r\nsignificantly contribute to reinvigorating the United\r\nNations role and assistance for the development efforts\r\nof the African countries.\r\nAfrican people have suffered for a long time.\r\nChallenges faced by Africa are colossal. We genuinely\r\nneed to launch global action, not rhetoric, to ensure\r\nthat the internationally agreed goals for Africa are\r\nachieved over a specified time-frame. Words should be\r\nturned into deeds. Otherwise, the suffering of Africa\r\nwill continue unabated.\r\nThe international community must launch a\r\nconcerted effort to promote peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the continent of Africa. This is our\r\nmoral obligation and political responsibility. Let us\r\nhonour this commitment to our African partners.\r\nMr. Mangueira (Angola): I would like to express\r\nour condolences to Singapore on the tragic crash of the\r\nSingapore Airlines aircraft. I would also like to thank\r\nall our friends and colleagues who have conveyed their\r\ncondolences to us today on the tragic crash in Angola\r\nin which 48 people died.\r\nOn behalf of the Angolan delegation, I would like\r\nto congratulate Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani on his\r\npresentation of the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on the Causes of Conflict and the\r\nPromotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa. Angola was one of the\r\ncountries that actively participated in the last session of\r\nthe Working Group, and therefore could not but\r\nparticipate in today’s debate on this important issue.\r\nIn our opinion, the main goal of the Working\r\nGroup is to seek modalities for further action to\r\nprevent conflicts in Africa in order to promote peace,\r\nsecurity and economic growth in that part of the world.\r\nOur delegation therefore finds the present report to be\r\nan acceptable document that reflects the compromise\r\nreached by States during the last session and contains\r\nuseful proposals towards reaching the goals I have just\r\nmentioned.\r\nOne of the tasks before the international\r\ncommunity is to follow up the recommendations and\r\ndecisions taken on different issues. The report notes\r\nthat many recommendations have been made by the\r\ninternational community in such fields as\r\npeacekeeping, finance, debt, social development, AIDS\r\nand human capacity. Unfortunately, the results of those\r\nrecommendations and decisions do not cover all the\r\nissues that African States expected would be addressed.\r\nThis is due, among other things, to the absence of an\r\neffective mechanism to implement and coordinate\r\nactions.\r\nIn our view, one of the most important tasks of\r\nthe Working Group is to draw more attention to the\r\nquestion of how to strengthen at all levels the\r\nmechanism to implement decisions in order to avoid a\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\ngap between decisions and actions taken. We\r\nunderstand well the moral character of the\r\nrecommendations, but we cannot let their political\r\nforce be lost because of relationships between\r\ncountries. The situation in Africa would have changed\r\nfor the better if there had been active participation by\r\nweapon-producing countries and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions in the meetings of the Working Group, and\r\nif Member States had shown greater willingness to\r\nimplement and respect the decisions taken collectively\r\nby the international community.\r\nIn that regard, allow me to give one concrete\r\nexample. The Security Council has adopted resolutions\r\nto put an end to the Angolan conflict, namely,\r\nresolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997), 1173 (1998) and,\r\nmore recently, resolution 1295 (2000). Had those\r\nresolutions been fully implemented by some concerned\r\nStates and supervised more effectively, life could have\r\nbeen made better for all Angolans throughout the\r\ncountry. We can find similar situations in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and\r\nother countries in Africa. It is not only important to\r\nadopt good resolutions, but also to reinforce the\r\nimplementation mechanism for those\r\ndecisions — including through the use of\r\nsanctions — in order to be more effective not only in\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building processes, but also in\r\nother fields.\r\nOf course, a country like Angola, which spends\r\nmore than half of its gross domestic product on war\r\nand security matters, meets with serious difficulties in\r\nsustaining its economy and developing programmes to\r\nface its grave humanitarian situation and eradicate\r\npoverty. This means that there is a direct linkage\r\nbetween peace, security and sustainable development.\r\nThe development of Africa covers all areas of\r\nsocial life, including politics, economics, social\r\nwelfare, education, peace and stability. Among other\r\nthings, African States need financial resources to reach\r\nthat development. The report of the Working Group\r\nnotes that the total resources allocated to development\r\nassistance for African countries has been decreasing\r\nsince the early 1990s. It is necessary to find a way to\r\nreverse that trend so that African countries can benefit\r\nmore from foreign debt investment destined for public\r\nhealth, developing economic structures, building\r\nhuman resource capacity, education, poverty\r\neradication, and so on.\r\nIn our view, the report does not sufficiently\r\naddress the role of such regional and subregional\r\nAfrican organizations as the Organization of African\r\nUnity, the African Economic Community, the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States and the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States in the\r\ndevelopment process and in eliminating the causes of\r\nconflicts in Africa. I think these organizations play an\r\nimportant role in this matter, especially in the areas of\r\npeace, settling disputes among Member States and\r\ncreating conditions for strengthening regional\r\ncooperation with a view to a single African economic\r\nmarket. It is therefore necessary that the Working\r\nGroup emphasize the participation of all African\r\norganizations, each at its own level and within its own\r\nregion.\r\nWe are convinced that internal efforts have to be\r\nmade by African Governments to allow for the\r\nparticipation of civil society in State affairs through its\r\nelected representatives, democratic political regimes,\r\nthe private sector, investments, non-governmental\r\norganizations, trade unions and other organizations.\r\nThose efforts should also seek to create a culture of\r\ntransparency, accountability and peace. The rational\r\ncombination of domestic and international efforts is\r\none of the keys to finding a successful way of\r\npromoting durable peace and sustainable development.\r\nFinally, I would like to express my hope that\r\nthere be more participation by all concerned parties at\r\nthe next session of the Working Group in order that the\r\nrecommendations that have been adopted will translate\r\ninto actions and not be mere words.\r\nMr. Absi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): On behalf of the delegation of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, I commend United Nations efforts to address\r\nthe problems of the African continent. I thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/52/871).\r\nAfrica continues to face obstacles that hamper its\r\ndevelopment process. These include local and regional\r\narmed conflicts, growing indebtedness, rampant\r\npoverty, scarcity of financial resources, and the spread\r\nof dangerous diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.\r\nThe situation is exacerbated by Africa’s inability to\r\nreap the benefits of peaceful technologies; this has had\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\na negative effect on Africa’s inclusion in economic\r\nprogress, especially at the international level.\r\nDespite the key role that the United Nations has\r\nplayed in Africa in the past, we consider that much\r\nremains to be done. There must be a concerted regional\r\nand international effort to promote African resources\r\nand capabilities so that the continent can take its proper\r\nplace in the world economic and political arena. To\r\nattain that goal, and if we are to arrive at a new system\r\nthat would help in resolving conflicts peacefully and\r\nthrough negotiations, and in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of the Charter and international law, there\r\nmust be political will at the local level, accompanied\r\nby broader political will at the regional and\r\ninternational levels. This must be accompanied by\r\nstrengthened cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of African Unity (OAU). In that\r\ncontext, we stress how important it is to consider the\r\nrecommendations of the report (A/55/305) of the Panel\r\non United Nations Peace Operations chaired by Mr.\r\nLakhdar Brahimi if we are to put an end to the\r\ndestructive conflicts that beset the African continent\r\nand to set up a rapid reaction force to contain such\r\nconflicts in ways consistent with the specific\r\ncharacteristics of each conflict.\r\nWe are convinced that developed countries and\r\ninternational and regional development institutions\r\nhave a role to play in providing both official and\r\nunofficial assistance, in the form of loans and grants, to\r\nAfrican countries with a view to eliminating their\r\nexternal debt, especially the debt of the least developed\r\nones, helping their economies and improving the level\r\nof investment. This requires that the developed world’s\r\nmarkets be opened to products from developing\r\ncountries.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-\r\nNahyan, the head of State of the United Arab Emirates,\r\nis convinced that there can be a bright future for Africa\r\nand for all mankind. In the light of the historical and\r\ncultural links between the United Arab Emirates and\r\nAfrica, our State has worked to engage in economic,\r\nsocial and cultural cooperation with many African\r\ncountries. The United Arab Emirates participates in\r\nnumerous programmes providing support and\r\nhumanitarian and development assistance, both through\r\nofficial channels including the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and regional funds, and\r\nthrough public-sector projects and public-sector\r\norganizations such as Red Crescent societies.\r\nThe delegation of the United Arab Emirates\r\nhopes that, with the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity, African countries will succeed in\r\novercoming the difficult obstacles and challenges that\r\nbeset them so that they can take their proper place in\r\nthe international arena and meet their peoples’\r\naspirations for peace, security, stability and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Mmualefe (Botswana): The report of the\r\nOpen-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the Causes of\r\nConflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and\r\nSustainable Development in Africa, contained in\r\ndocument A/55/45, provides the General Assembly\r\nwith proposals on how to move forward in a concrete\r\nmanner on recommendations made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on this very important issue.\r\nIn our view, the Working Group must be\r\ncommended for discharging the initial phase of its task\r\nof monitoring the implementation both of the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals and of those which\r\nemerged from the 1999 coordination segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. At this juncture, my\r\ndelegation wishes to commend the Vice-Chairmen of\r\nthe Working Group, the representatives of Singapore\r\nand of Spain, for their leadership and their commitment\r\nto the process.\r\nIt is clear that the problems of underdevelopment\r\nand poverty afflicting many African countries are\r\nlinked to both domestic and international factors and\r\nrequire holistic treatment if real and sustainable\r\nsolutions are to be found. Despite unremitting efforts\r\nby African countries to lift themselves out of\r\ndifficulties and crises, only partial success has been\r\nachieved. This, however, is no surprise, because the\r\nunderlying factors that influence growth, development\r\nand peace have not yet been adequately addressed.\r\nPoverty is one such factor which causes a loss of\r\nhuman potential and which leads to the destabilization\r\nof societies. There is, therefore, a pressing necessity\r\nfor coordinated, cross-sectoral efforts to eradicate\r\npoverty.\r\nThe Working Group wisely limited its focus to\r\nthree additional areas: debt relief, HIV/AIDS and\r\nsupport to countries in post-conflict situations. There is\r\nno doubt that these are very important issues in the\r\ncontext of African development. In fact, many\r\nintergovernmental conferences, notably the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, have identified these\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nissues as critical and urgent. Unfortunately,\r\nimplementation still lags behind.\r\nIt is now widely recognized that the full\r\nengagement of civil society organizations and the\r\nprivate sector is vital if the goals set out in the report,\r\nas well as those elaborated under the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa, are to be\r\nrealized.\r\nThe task before this Organization will be a long-\r\ndrawn-out and arduous one. African countries are\r\nwilling to meet their end of the bargain, as was made\r\nclear at the recent Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) Summit, as well as the Africa-Europe Summit,\r\nduring which African Governments committed\r\nthemselves to promoting an environment conducive to\r\ndevelopment. What is required now are consolidated\r\nefforts by us all to support the development of Africa.\r\nThese efforts should build upon initiatives already\r\nundertaken by African countries for conflict resolution.\r\nIn this regard, we wish to highlight the important role\r\nplayed by the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), supported by the\r\nOAU, in dealing with conflict situations in their\r\nsubregions.\r\nThe United Nations system, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and our bilateral donors should aim at\r\ncoordinated approaches which will have an impact on\r\ncommunities across the African continent. It is evident\r\nthat close monitoring and clear target-setting have to be\r\nundertaken if we are to continue to benefit from an\r\nobjective assessment of progress on the ground. That is\r\nwhy we strongly believe that the Working Group\r\nshould continue with its mandate of monitoring\r\nprogress. In our opinion, the continuation of the\r\nWorking Group would allow the General Assembly to\r\nexamine other areas outside the mandate of the\r\nWorking Group and also make room for the inclusion\r\nof emerging issues.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of Botswana\r\nappreciates the renewed focus on Africa by the United\r\nNations. The Millennium Summit pronounced itself\r\nstrongly on African issues, and we hope that this\r\npronouncement will also find expression in the\r\noutcome of the forthcoming high-level international\r\nintergovernmental event on financing for development.\r\nMr. Cappagli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nshould like first to express the gratitude of the\r\ndelegation of Argentina to the Chairman of the Ad Hoc\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Causes of Conflict\r\nand the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa, Foreign Minister Gurirab of\r\nNamibia, and the two Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador\r\nMahbubani of Singapore and Ambassador Arias of\r\nSpain, for their hard work during the three sessions of\r\nthe Working Group this year and for the complete and\r\nwell-balanced report submitted for the Assembly’s\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe agree with the fundamental premise of the\r\nreport regarding the relationship between peace and\r\ndevelopment. In order to achieve lasting peace in\r\nAfrica, minimum conditions for development must be\r\ncreated. The majority of African Governments are\r\nmaking enormous efforts to resolve ongoing disputes in\r\na peaceful manner, strengthen their democratic\r\ninstitutions, promote human rights and reform their\r\neconomies. Those tasks, which are being carried out by\r\nAfricans themselves, require the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWith regard to armed conflict, we believe it\r\nessential to adopt an integrated strategy that\r\nincorporates elements of conflict prevention, conflict\r\nresolution and post-conflict peace-building. Close and\r\nconstant cooperation and a substantive exchange of\r\ninformation between the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the African\r\nsubregional organizations will be indispensable at\r\nevery stage. Clearly, the OAU has a relevant role to\r\nplay in resolving African conflicts, and we believe that\r\nChapter VIII of the United Nations Charter is an\r\nimportant instrument in this respect. However, this in\r\nno way exempts the Security Council from its main\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. On the contrary, following the cold\r\nwar, it will require new sensitivity on the part of the\r\nSecurity Council if it is to understand the nature and\r\nthe deep-rooted causes of African conflict. Only more\r\ndirect knowledge of the realities in the countries\r\naffected and of the political, social, economic and\r\nhumanitarian circumstances surrounding conflict, can\r\nresult in such sensitivity.\r\nIn this context, we believe that the Security\r\nCouncil missions this year to the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone were a\r\nstep in the right direction. Furthermore, greater\r\ntransparency in the work of the Security Council,\r\ncloser contact with the General Assembly and the\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.47\r\nestablishment of a frank dialogue with the parties to\r\nconflict and with troop-contributing countries are also\r\nrequired. In this respect, the initiative to hold\r\nsubstantive meetings with troop-contributing countries,\r\nsuch as took place in October with regard to the United\r\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone, must be maintained\r\nand strengthened. In Africa, as in other parts of the\r\nworld, the success of a peacekeeping operation will\r\ndepend on the existence of political will, expressed in\r\nconcrete terms through the contribution of adequate\r\nfinancial and human resources.\r\nAn examination of the relationship between the\r\nillegal exploitation of natural resources and the\r\ncontinuation of armed conflict is a further element in\r\nhelping us to understand armed conflict. In that respect,\r\nthe establishment of the independent panels of experts\r\nfor the Democratic Republic of the Congo and for\r\nSierra Leone will enable progress to be made.\r\nFinally, the tribunals for Rwanda and for Sierra\r\nLeone will be an important deterrent and an\r\nindispensable component of a stable, lasting and just\r\npeace. We believe that there will be no true\r\nreconciliation and peace-building if those responsible\r\nfor crimes that offend the common conscience of\r\nhumanity go unpunished.\r\nWe live in a world of contradictions: integration\r\nand globalization coexist with fragmentation and\r\nmarginalization. Reality shows us that the economic\r\nprosperity achieved in recent years coexists with the\r\nmost extreme poverty in certain parts of Africa and\r\nelsewhere in the world. One fifth of humankind has to\r\nsurvive on just $1 per day. In spite of this, official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) has been constantly\r\ndeclining. We believe that it must be increased. We\r\nalso believe that the relationship between ODA and the\r\nimplementation of policies is the key to ensuring\r\nsustained economic growth in Africa. Combating\r\ninflation and the fiscal deficit and encouraging savings\r\nand investment are measures that are directly related to\r\nthe effectiveness of ODA.\r\nSupport should not be confined to ODA. It must\r\nalso take the form of trade liberalization that will allow\r\nfor greater international integration of African\r\ncountries in the global market. Tariff barriers are taking\r\nnew forms, such as the setting of work standards,\r\nenvironmental standards and anti-dumping measures,\r\nsending a discouraging signal to those African\r\ncountries that are making considerable efforts to\r\nmodernize their economies and acquire new export\r\nmarkets.\r\nToday we wish to renew once again Argentina’s\r\ncommitment to Africa. From the beginning, our\r\ncountry has participated in and encouraged the\r\ndecolonization process on the continent. Today we are\r\npromoting the state of law and the opening of the\r\neconomy in the region. We have increased our trade\r\nand strengthened political relations. Consistent with the\r\nbelief that peace and development are linked,\r\nArgentina has made contributions to peacekeeping\r\noperations in Africa, provided humanitarian assistance\r\ndirectly or through the “White Helmets” and promoted\r\ncooperation for development through cooperation\r\nfunds. Furthermore, in the framework of the Zone of\r\nPeace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic, which\r\nconnects three Latin American countries with\r\n21 African countries, and which Argentina has been\r\ncoordinating since 1998, we have proposed a series of\r\ninitiatives aimed at deepening cooperation among its\r\nmembers.\r\nWe wish to conclude by reiterating the role\r\nplayed by African countries through the OAU and\r\nthrough subregional organizations in seeking solutions\r\nto their problems. The international community cannot,\r\nnor should it, remain indifferent to that effort. The\r\nUnited Nations, because of its universal character, and\r\nbecause of its broad mandate in the political, economic\r\nand social areas, has the capacity and the legitimacy to\r\ncontribute effectively to peace and development in\r\nAfrica. We believe that the special Working Group has\r\ncarried out, and must continue to carry out, an\r\nimportant task of analysis, coordination and\r\noperational follow-up of the different initiatives for\r\nAfrica existing within the United Nations system.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.55 p.m.\r\n"
