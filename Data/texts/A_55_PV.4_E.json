May I\r\ncongratulate Mr. Kofi Annan on the numerous and\r\nhighly commendable initiatives that he has introduced\r\nand supported as Secretary-General.\r\nI wish to turn immediately to the important fields\r\nin which challenges remain to be met.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nGlobalization presents a major challenge to the\r\nUnited Nations, involving as it does, almost by\r\ndefinition, every nation on this planet. The continuing\r\nspread of technological and other improvements is\r\nproviding new opportunities to advance human\r\nsocieties and to create higher living standards across\r\nthe planet. However, in many countries, poverty and\r\nwant show little sign of decreasing, and may even be\r\nworsened by some aspects of globalization. Not\r\nsurprisingly, this has created widespread disaffection\r\nagainst the very process.\r\nThe United Nations, as a global and international\r\nOrganization, can play a major role in ensuring a more\r\nequitable distribution of the resources generated\r\nthrough globalization. It can draw on the unique\r\nstrengths of its universality and neutrality, and on its\r\nestablished, on-the-ground presence in numerous\r\ncountries.\r\nThese strengths allow the United Nations to make\r\nobjective assessments of the difficulties in each\r\nparticular country and to prescribe remedial courses of\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\naction in partnership with the Governments concerned.\r\nHowever, the plethora of United Nations bodies with\r\ndiffering mandates has become unwieldy, difficult to\r\nmanage and confusing. In some cases, the\r\nconfiguration of the United Nations presence does not\r\nmatch the requirements of a particular country.\r\nThe United Nations must therefore strengthen its\r\ncoordinating role and streamline its institutions. It must\r\nfocus on results and impact. It must develop assistance\r\nprogrammes without competition, overlap or waste.\r\nThe United Nations must reassess its resource-\r\nallocation policies, which, in some cases, have proven\r\nmost wasteful and ineffective. It is one thing to oppose\r\nconditionality, but there should be no objections to\r\nstricter accountability and tighter follow-up\r\nrequirements, thus ensuring that any aid received is\r\nwell and truly spent on the purposes it had been\r\ndestined for.\r\nThe United Nations must also reassess its military\r\npeacekeeping operations, not all of which have been\r\nsuccessful. Recently, 500 United Nations soldiers were\r\ncaptured and then released by rebel forces in Sierra\r\nLeone. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts have not attained\r\ntheir objectives. In Bosnia and Herzegovina and in\r\nRwanda, United Nations peacekeepers became passive\r\nwitnesses to wide-scale slaughter and atrocities and,\r\njust this morning again, we heard about tragedies in\r\nEast Timor.\r\nThere is little purpose in passing peacekeeping\r\nresolutions that cannot be implemented. Perhaps we\r\nshould prepare for worst-case scenarios and arm the\r\nUnited Nations forces for more muscular peace\r\nenforcement, rather than send in lightly armed troops\r\nwho cannot intervene in serious armed conflict. The\r\nreport of the United Nations Panel on Peace Operations\r\ncontains constructive recommendations that are well\r\nworth considering. This is one major issue that will\r\nhave to be addressed by the Security Council.\r\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council\r\nitself, Latvia agrees that such reforms are urgently\r\nneeded in order to make that important organ better\r\nreflect existing realities.\r\nIt is my pleasure to announce that, within Latvia’s\r\nmodest possibilities, my country has donated a\r\nbeautiful and fully renovated building in the old town\r\nof Riga, the capital city, for the use of the United\r\nNations organizations in Latvia. As a donor country,\r\nLatvia is also increasing its contributions to the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\ncovering UNDP’s local office costs. In addition, Latvia\r\nis once again making a voluntary contribution to the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nLatvia believes that, at the turn of the\r\nmillennium, the United Nations Member Governments\r\nmust work seriously to render this Organization more\r\nefficient and effective in the common fight against\r\npoverty, war, corruption, lawlessness and torture and in\r\nthe promotion of human rights. We must concentrate\r\nour efforts on transforming the United Nations into an\r\nefficient problem-solving and development-oriented\r\nOrganization that people can truly trust and rely upon.\r\nMay it truly come to pass.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Natsagiyn Bagabandi, President of Mongolia.\r\nPresident Bagabandi (spoke in Mongolian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Mongolia\r\nviews this unprecedented gathering of world leaders as\r\nan event of historic importance that offers us a unique\r\nopportunity to reaffirm our faith in the United Nations\r\nand to formulate our shared vision on how collectively\r\nto address the pressing challenges, both existing and\r\nemerging. The United Nations has consistently\r\nmanifested its undisputed authority in identifying ways\r\nand means to address major global problems. Yet, the\r\nneed to reform and adapt the United Nations to the\r\nevolving international realities, with a view to ensuring\r\nits efficient functioning in the era of globalization,\r\nappears to have been universally recognized.\r\nSome important steps to this end have already\r\nbeen taken. However, the reform process, particularly\r\nthe Security Council reform, has a tendency to slow\r\ndown and there is therefore an apparent need to take\r\nappropriate measures to accelerate it. Mongolia is in\r\nfavour of a just and equitable enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council by increasing the number of\r\npermanent and non-permanent seats and ensuring\r\nrepresentation of developing and developed countries\r\nalike. We also favour the democratization of\r\ninternational relations through increased openness and\r\ntransparency in the work of the Security Council and\r\nan enhanced role of the General Assembly, as\r\nenvisaged in the United Nations Charter.\r\nIn carrying out its activities in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the United Nations\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nshould give priority to preventive diplomacy, especially\r\nin matters pertaining to international and internal\r\ndisputes and conflicts. In this respect, further\r\nenhancement of the relevant international mechanisms\r\nappears to be crucial. Furthermore, ensuring the\r\nuniversality of international instruments concerning\r\ndisarmament, crime prevention, human rights, the\r\nenvironment and other fields requires further\r\ncollaborative efforts and a strong display of political\r\nwill by all the stakeholders.\r\nAs the Secretary-General rightly pinpoints in his\r\nmillennium report, the central challenge we face today\r\nis to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force\r\nfor all the world’s people. Today, not only do ideas of\r\nglobality pervade the language of politicians,\r\neconomists and researchers the world over;\r\nglobalization as a reality has generated a host of\r\nmultifaceted challenges beyond the reach of a single\r\nnation. It has become more evident that, along with\r\ngreater opportunities, globalization has created\r\nsituations of heightened vulnerability. This is all the\r\nmore true for the weak and poor nations and leads to\r\ntheir further marginalization.\r\nThe question is how to manage the inevitable\r\nprocess of globalization so that it incorporates the\r\nhuman dimension in its seemingly unruly trends.\r\nMongolia believes that, with its impartiality and\r\nuniversal legitimacy, as well as its Charter-based\r\nprevalence over any other international agreement, the\r\nUnited Nations is uniquely placed to provide an\r\noverarching general guidance to the process of\r\nglobalization so that its benefits may be enjoyed by all,\r\nespecially the small States.\r\nNo matter how liberal the world economy is\r\nbecoming, it is a matter of fact that many developing\r\ncountries have found themselves handicapped in\r\nseeking to enjoy the fruits of global liberalization.\r\nTherefore, it is our considered view that countries in a\r\ndisadvantaged location, facing specific difficulties and\r\nserious constraints in their development efforts, need\r\nthe closer attention and support of the international\r\ncommunity. Proceeding from this premise, Mongolia\r\nhas circulated as an official document of the United\r\nNations the memorandum of its Government on how to\r\nenhance the role of the Organization in promoting the\r\nsecurity interests of small States. We would appreciate\r\nthe inputs and support of the other Members regarding\r\nour initiative.\r\nMongolia fully shares the Secretary-General’s\r\ncall upon us, the Member States, to spare no effort to\r\nmake the United Nations a more effective instrument in\r\npursuing the threefold freedom identified in the\r\nmillennium report. The honourable mission of ensuring\r\nhuman security and promoting human-centred\r\ndevelopment should remain high on the agenda of the\r\nworld Organization. In recognition of the crucial role\r\nof education in human development, Mongolia\r\nreiterates its conviction of the need to launch a United\r\nNations literacy decade to marshal strong political will\r\nand determination towards ensuring lifelong education\r\nfor all.\r\nMongolia fully supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to establish a health inter-network with\r\n10,000 on-line sites in developing countries to provide\r\naccess to up-to-date medical information and to ensure\r\nreliable and fast communications in disaster-stricken\r\nareas.\r\nOver the last decade, Mongolia has developed\r\ndemocratic institutions in the political, economic and\r\nsocial spheres, while promoting human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms and pursuing an open and multi-\r\npillared foreign policy.\r\nThe new Parliament and Government of\r\nMongolia, which were formed following the general\r\nelections held last July, are resolved to vigorously\r\npursue the programme of action designed to revive and\r\nencourage the national economy, ensure sustained\r\neconomic growth, upgrade the living standards of the\r\npeople, and reduce poverty and unemployment in close\r\ncooperation with the international community.\r\nMay I express my confidence that this Summit\r\nwill yield a common strategy for the world community\r\nto collectively work in the new century towards a safer,\r\nmore equitable and prosperous future.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria.\r\nMr. Bouteflika (spoke in French): Although it\r\nhas become commonplace to talk about the astonishing\r\nprogress made in science and technology, it is\r\nnevertheless true that the effects of that progress on our\r\ndaily lives and on our societies are not yet fully known.\r\nThose unknown effects can lead to speculation of the\r\nwildest sort. The conquest of space and the often\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nstriking advances in genetics could give one the\r\nimpression that man now has unlimited power over\r\nnature and the universe. However, those achievements\r\nhave also allowed the continued existence of the ills\r\nthat beset the majority of mankind and for which we\r\nhave yet to find solutions.\r\nAdvances in communications that would have\r\nseemed unimaginable just a few years ago have\r\ncertainly shrunk our world. But have those advances\r\nsimilarly increased the feeling of solidarity among\r\nhuman beings and between peoples? We know that this\r\nshrinking of our universe is leading inexorably towards\r\nglobalization, from which none of us will be able to\r\nescape. We also know that it foretells a real shake-up in\r\nthe behaviour and structures of our societies and the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nSuch changes are worrisome because of their\r\nscope, their suddenness and, above all, because they\r\nseem to be independent of our own will. We must adapt\r\nto those changes or be condemned to remain on the\r\nfringes of modern life, unable to ascertain the future or\r\nto act on it. Will we be able to maintain a semblance of\r\nfree will in this mad pursuit into which we are being\r\ndragged by the new discoveries in science and\r\ntechnology? Will we be able to make our own choices,\r\nset our own priorities, and preserve the moral values on\r\nwhich our civilizations have been built?\r\nThe legitimate fears aroused by these questions\r\nare even more acute in our underdeveloped countries,\r\nwhere our economic, social and even cultural structures\r\nare more vulnerable to these assaults by progress and\r\nto the constraints of a globalization that is creeping\r\nprogressively but inevitably into our daily lives and\r\nthat daily decreases the scope of our freedom. At the\r\ndawn of the twenty-first century, we therefore wonder\r\nwith the greatest concern about the place our countries\r\nwill occupy in tomorrow’s world, a world based on the\r\nimplacable law of power and governed by the\r\ninflexible rules of the market. Will we still be able to\r\nmake our voices heard in the debates that will decide\r\nour future, or will we lapse into some sort of disguised\r\nservitude in which we will once again become the\r\nobjects — either consciously or not — of schemes that\r\nwill by and large exclude us?\r\nThe idea of democracy has made its way in the\r\nworld and is beginning to permeate political life in our\r\ncountries. Democratic culture is spreading throughout\r\nsocial classes as the intellectual level of our\r\npopulations increases. Conversely, international life is\r\nincreasingly moving away from democratic practices as\r\ndecision-making power is being concentrated in the\r\nhands of the great Powers, especially in those of the\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nBut here again, things are changing. Under\r\nglobalization, even political decisions are governed by\r\neconomic considerations. This brings into play the\r\nfinancial interests of multinational corporations and\r\nhighlights the market forces that now govern\r\ntraditional diplomacy. As has been said, old negotiators\r\nno longer play any role other than that of being mere\r\nbaggage handlers to high-flying banks and\r\nmultinationals.\r\nIn a word, the world is becoming de-humanized,\r\nand that is the source of the anguish I referred to that is\r\nfelt by all countries of the South and which for us is\r\ncharacteristic of our entry into the third millennium.\r\nWhile prosperity is increasing in rich countries and\r\nbecoming more promising, our countries are\r\nfloundering in underdevelopment that we absolutely\r\ncannot overcome because of the weight of endless debt.\r\nWill we one day be able to free ourselves from this\r\ncrushing subservience and finally be able to devote our\r\nresources to our development and the well-being of our\r\npopulations? From now on we are bound to a system of\r\nexpanded, unequal and mercilessly marginalizing\r\ncompetition.\r\nWe would like to convey here our feeling of deep\r\nhelplessness, not to tarnish the excitement we share\r\nwith everyone else at seeing human beings extend their\r\npower and domination over nature, but to warn about\r\nthe price that will have to be paid if the majority of\r\nmankind were to be marginalized in an international\r\nsociety based solely on the notion of material profit.\r\nFor us, the United Nations remains the\r\nOrganization best able to take note of our fears and to\r\ntry to find appropriate answers. The Organization has\r\nsurvived all the hazards of international life. No one\r\ncan call into question the undeniable service it has\r\nrendered to the cause of peace in the world. It will\r\ncertainly have to submit itself to renovation in order to\r\nensure the preservation of the ideals of justice and\r\npeace that were part of its creation. In this regard, the\r\nanalyses and suggestions contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General seem to us fully relevant. I would\r\nlike to refer to just one of the observations contained in\r\nthe report.\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nIt is clear that the game of international relations\r\nthat used to be played exclusively among States\r\nincreasingly involves that which we have agreed to\r\nrefer to as civil society — represented by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — and is extending to\r\nincreasingly diverse fields. I personally think that the\r\nrole of non-governmental organizations must be\r\nacknowledged and that it is in everyone’s interest to\r\ndetermine the status of non-governmental organizations\r\nin international relations.\r\nOur concerns are numerous and pressing, and\r\ntime is short. I simply wish to say that I hope that this\r\nSummit will lead to an awareness of our nations’\r\ndifficulties and of the worries of our peoples. Faced\r\nwith misery and endless distress, we would like to\r\nbelieve in the advent of a world in which the right to\r\ndignity is not measured in dollars. We remain deeply\r\nconvinced that dignity is an essential, absolute and\r\ndefinitive characteristic of the human condition.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, President of the Republic\r\nof Belarus.\r\nPresident Lukashenka (spoke in Russian): The\r\nAlmighty has endowed States and peoples, just like\r\nindividuals, with equal rights to freedom, peace,\r\nsecurity and a decent life. Yet for many centuries a\r\nsmall group of States has ruled the destinies of the\r\nworld, regarding other nations and peoples as a mass\r\nwith no rights.\r\nThe great achievement of the United Nations\r\nsystem, as I see it, is that the division of peoples into\r\nsubjects and objects of international law has been\r\neliminated. Today every State, regardless of its size and\r\nresources, has the opportunity to participate on an\r\nequal basis in solving the topical problems facing the\r\nworld community.\r\nThe Belarusian people have made a considerable\r\ncontribution to the establishment of this just system.\r\nAnd we cannot accept any attempts to dictate to us how\r\nwe should live and with whom we should be friends.\r\nHaving sacrificed the lives of one third of its\r\ncitizens to the cause of victory in the war against\r\nfascism, Belarus is capable of determining its own\r\ndestiny. Having fully experienced the horrors of\r\ndevastating wars, Belarus cannot be indifferent to the\r\nattempts to break the stability of the emerging world\r\norder, to disrupt the geopolitical balance in the world,\r\nand bring back the times when States were divided into\r\nfirst- and second-rate countries.\r\nThe proposals of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral Mr. Annan, which are aimed at increasing the\r\nOrganization’s efficiency, evoke our profound interest.\r\nIn implementing these proposals it is important,\r\nas we say, not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.\r\nThe aims and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nshould be preserved. Only under these conditions can\r\nwe ensure that the Organization’s activity yields\r\npractical results and that it is capable of effectively\r\nresponding to the global challenges of our time.\r\nI think everybody will agree that with all the\r\ndiversity of the goals of the United Nations, the main\r\ntask of the Organization is to ensure international peace\r\nand security.\r\nFor the time being, unfortunately, the United\r\nNations is not fully able to deal with the task of\r\npreventing aggression and armed conflicts. The cases\r\nwhere military force was used, bypassing the United\r\nNations Security Council, have not resolved any issues,\r\nbut have only aggravated existing problems. Belarus\r\nholds the view that military force cannot be a\r\nlegitimate instrument of foreign policy in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe intention to make the world a safer place was\r\nthe main motive behind our decision to renounce the\r\nstatus of a nuclear State.\r\nI do not understand those countries who speak so\r\ninsistently about the threat of nuclear proliferation,\r\nsometimes from this rostrum, but at the same time do\r\nnot want to take on the responsibility of making\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe free of nuclear weapons, as\r\nproposed by Belarus on many occasions.\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to draw the\r\nattention of the world leaders present here today to the\r\nproblem of environmental protection and the\r\nresponsibility of large and small nations in that area.\r\nMany in the world have already started to forget\r\nthe greatest man-made disaster of the past century —\r\nthe Chernobyl disaster — whose main victim was\r\nBelarus. The moral duty of the United Nations is to\r\nmobilize world resources for dealing with the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl and other ecological\r\ndisasters. Without awareness of our joint responsibility\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nfor preserving the common human environment, all\r\ndiscussions of a fair distribution of the benefits and\r\ndisadvantages of globalization will remain just shallow\r\ntalk.\r\nHuman rights and democracy are the central\r\nissues of the Millennium Summit. I believe that nobody\r\nin this hall would question the significance of these\r\nvalues and high standards, which are set out in United\r\nNations documents.\r\nThe problem is that human rights and democracy\r\nare increasingly often being used by some States as a\r\npretext for punishing objectionable countries and\r\nnations.\r\nRecently, efforts have been made to create a sort\r\nof “club of the elect”, which excludes the majority of\r\nthe world’s nations. This arrogant attempt to divide the\r\npeoples into “teachers” and “pupils” can do no good\r\nfor the real encouragement of democracy and human\r\nrights.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to draw your attention\r\nto the necessity for a more deferential attitude to the\r\nunique nature, existing way of life and historical\r\ndestiny of every nation.\r\nFor the time being, unfortunately, in international\r\nrelations we are facing more frequent attempts of the\r\nbigger Powers to treat all alike and reject any national\r\nand regional features which do not fall into the\r\ncustomary framework of the “Western way of life”.\r\nI doubt whether the overwhelming majority of the\r\nUnited Nations would agree with such arrogance.\r\nBelarus is in the mainstream of democratic\r\ndevelopment. But in promoting democracy we rely, and\r\nshall continue to rely, on our own way of life and\r\nnational spiritual traditions which have been maturing\r\nover centuries.\r\nThis is why we manage to combine development,\r\ndemocracy and stability. There are not and have never\r\nbeen any religious or ethnic conflicts in our country.\r\nOur borders are the borders of peace and cooperation.\r\nWe are open to friendship and cooperation with all\r\nthose who respect our country and people.\r\nAddressing the United Nations from this high\r\nrostrum, I declare that in the new millennium my\r\ncountry shall continue to be your reliable partner in\r\npromoting the cause of peace and security on the\r\nplanet.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): Before giving\r\nthe floor to the next speaker, I would like to make an\r\nappeal. Members are aware that there are still several\r\nspeakers remaining on the list of speakers for this\r\nmeeting. Since we must exhaust the list for each\r\nmeeting, I should like to appeal to the participants in\r\nthe Millennium Summit to respect as much as possible\r\nthe five-minute speaking time allotted to each speaker.\r\nThis would allow us to hear all the speakers on the list.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Thomas Klestil, Federal President of\r\nthe Republic of Austria.\r\nPresident Klestil: This assembly of world\r\nleaders is a unique occasion to celebrate and reaffirm\r\nour unity of purpose and our support for the United\r\nNations. Guided by the Secretary-General’s\r\nMillennium Report, we are also called upon to explore\r\nthe longer-term necessities and options of development\r\nin our community of nations. Arnold Toynbee’s theory\r\nof history as the result of “challenges” and the\r\nrespective “responses” offers a suitable approach for\r\nanalysing the United Nations.\r\nBuilt on the ashes of the disastrous Second World\r\nWar, the Organization’s agenda and mode of operation\r\nhave evolved in response to the issues of each decade.\r\nIt is amazing how the world Organization, over more\r\nthan half a century, has been able to provide valuable\r\nleadership in promoting peace and security; in\r\nsuccessfully supporting the decolonization process; in\r\npromoting and protecting a global system of human\r\nrights standards; in transforming itself, in part, into a\r\nbroad-based programme of development cooperation;\r\nin articulating and addressing the new global agenda as\r\nit has evolved, dealing with population growth, human\r\nrights, social development, the role of women in our\r\nsocieties, natural resources and sustainable\r\ndevelopment and food and health, all issues that were\r\nthe subjects of world conferences during the past\r\ndecade.\r\nThis Summit also offers a special opportunity to\r\nthank all those men and women who have served the\r\nUnited Nations with great dedication and distinction —\r\nespecially those who have lost their lives in the defence\r\nof high goals and ideals. A special tribute is due to the\r\nSecretaries-General of the Organization, from Trygve\r\nLie, Dag Hammarskjöld, U Thant, Kurt Waldheim,\r\nJavier Pérez de Cuéllar and Boutros Boutros-Ghali to\r\nKofi Annan. Coming from a country which hosts one\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nof the main centres of the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies, I should like to convey my\r\nprofound appreciation for the enthusiasm and idealism\r\nof the staff, which has been a major resource for the\r\ndevelopment of the world Organization.\r\nOne of the most significant achievements of the\r\nrecent past has been the increasing democratization of\r\nglobal affairs. The Secretary-General, making an\r\nallusion to the Charter, rightly entitled his report\r\n(A/54/2000) “We the peoples” and not “We the\r\nGovernments”. Over the past 30 years, it may have\r\nbeen peoples more than Governments that shaped and\r\npromoted the agenda of the United Nations. Especially\r\nsince the United Nations Conference on the Human\r\nEnvironment, held in 1972 at Stockholm, we have\r\nbenefited from a dynamic interrelationship between\r\ndiplomatic negotiations on the one hand and the\r\narticulations of international civil society on the other.\r\nToday, it might well be unthinkable to deal with any\r\nglobal issue without the participation and contributions\r\nof civil society. The way we address today issues of\r\nhuman rights, of the environment, of disaster relief and\r\ndevelopment cooperation, of security and, in particular,\r\nof human security, to mention only a few, is\r\ncharacterized by new forms of dialogue, participation\r\nand commitment on the part of civil society. Neither\r\nthe successful completion of the negotiations on the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction nor the Rome process towards an\r\nInternational Criminal Court would have been possible\r\nwithout the truly innovative and productive response\r\non their part.\r\nI should also like to welcome the recent initiative\r\nby the Secretary-General to develop a new partnership\r\nwith the business community. To face the challenges of\r\nglobalization, a platform like the “Global Compact” —\r\nwhich emerged from the discussion at the World\r\nEconomic Forum in Davos — can certainly make a\r\nvaluable contribution to addressing global issues and\r\nthe broad societal responsibilities they entail.\r\nOver the past decades the United Nations has\r\nshown impressive flexibility and an ability to carry out\r\ninstitutional innovation. However, if we review the past\r\ndevelopment of United Nations organs and\r\norganizations, we have to admit that much of this was\r\nrather sectoral, ad hoc and always under the constraints\r\nof budgetary limitations. In short, I believe that the\r\nmost important question put before us by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral relates to the institutional development of the\r\nUnited Nations. It is there that great efforts are\r\nrequired and that innovative responses will have to be\r\nfound to make real a renewed United Nations in a\r\nglobal neighbourhood of peace and development for\r\nall.\r\nKeeping in mind the complex interrelationships\r\nthat exist today among the manifold dimensions of\r\npeace and security, of economic and human-centred\r\ndevelopment and of environmental sustainability, our\r\napproach to the institutional challenge will have to be\r\nmore comprehensive than in the past. The new\r\nchallenges in dealing with the global agenda require\r\nnew intersectoral, interdisciplinary, broad-based\r\ninstitutional responses. This implies that our approach\r\nto the challenge of renewing the United Nations must\r\nnot be limited to a specific function, to a specific organ\r\nor even to a specific organization. The time has come\r\nto understand the institutional development of the\r\nUnited Nations as comprehending the entire global\r\nagenda, the entire system of organizations, and all\r\ntypes of actors: Governments, the academic\r\ncommunity, civil society, parliamentary representatives\r\nand business leaders.\r\nThe millennium is a good moment to begin, and\r\nthis Summit is an excellent occasion to gather the\r\nnecessary political will and momentum. No quick fixes\r\nare possible. All elements in our global society must\r\nparticipate and share in the responsibility for our\r\ncommon future. With the goal of implementing the\r\nfundamental objectives of the Charter, we must\r\nestablish the institutions appropriate for the agenda of\r\nour time.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Majesty Mswati III,\r\nHead of State of the Kingdom of Swaziland.\r\nKing Mswati III: I am delighted to represent the\r\nSwazi nation at this historic Millennium Summit. The\r\nentire membership of the United Nations has gathered\r\ntogether for these three days to agree on how our\r\nOrganization must adapt in order to assist its Members\r\nto meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is presenting its\r\nproposals for the future role of the United Nations to\r\nenable the Organization to support us more efficiently\r\nin our efforts to meet the development priorities of our\r\npeople.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nWe will be discussing much-needed changes in\r\nthe structure, accountability and operations of the\r\nOrganization. But the Summit also provides the perfect\r\nopportunity to address the issue of global relationships\r\nand, in particular, how to correct the imbalance of\r\nwealth and social standards between the North and the\r\nSouth. In this increasingly interdependent world, it is\r\nmore important than ever for Member States to work\r\ntogether in unity and with respect for one another’s\r\nindividual viewpoints, regardless of size, influence and\r\neconomic strength.\r\nWe hope that the Summit will reconfirm the\r\nagreement of all Members that concepts such as\r\nglobalization are intended as a way for all countries to\r\nbenefit evenly from the new world order, and not as a\r\nmeans of continuing domination by the strong over the\r\nweak. And we would expect the needs of the\r\ndeveloping world to be treated seriously, with a\r\ncommitment from our partners to support our priority\r\nobjectives in an open and honest manner, while\r\nrespecting national wishes and beliefs, and without\r\nconditions that undermine sovereignty and\r\nindependence.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has three major\r\nconcerns that we believe require United Nations\r\nleadership in the twenty-first century. These involve\r\nthe acceptance of responsibility by the Organization,\r\nacceptance of a leading role in conflict prevention and\r\nresolution; in resource mobilization for development\r\npriorities; and in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\r\nFrom an African perspective, it is a fact that\r\nconflicts and instability on our continent not only cause\r\nimmense suffering to those directly involved, but can\r\nalso have a negative effect on the rest of our people.\r\nWe therefore fully support the call by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the United Nations to work hand in hand\r\nwith regional groupings to prevent potential conflict by\r\naddressing the root causes of problems.\r\nIn the global effort to eradicate poverty, we\r\nbelieve the United Nations must take a much stronger\r\nposition in helping developing countries mobilize\r\nfinancial resources with which to implement their\r\npriority projects, especially in job creation and\r\nessential infrastructure.\r\nAnd finally, with the terrible threat of HIV/AIDS\r\ncasting its shadow over the start of this new century,\r\nthere is surely an urgent need for the United Nations to\r\ntake the lead in the global fight against this powerful\r\nenemy of mankind. Because of AIDS, approximately\r\none quarter of my people will not survive beyond the\r\nnext 10 years and this is a fate they share with all too\r\nmany others in the developing world. We must\r\nacknowledge that AIDS is a far greater threat to global\r\nstability than even the great wars of the last century.\r\nWe have to act now to stop the spread of AIDS, before\r\nits devastating effects overtake those of the current\r\nconflicts on which we concentrate so much of our\r\nattention and resources. Among all the worthy talk of\r\nUnited Nations restructuring, let this message on\r\nHIV/AIDS be strong, focused and resource-oriented.\r\nThis is truly a role that the United Nations must play in\r\nthis century, if it is to fulfil its mandate to the people it\r\nserves.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland places great faith and\r\nhope in the success of this Summit. Our people deserve\r\nthe fullest commitment of all Member States to\r\nrecreate an Organization that lives up to the ideals of\r\nour founding Charter. We have the opportunity now to\r\nset the United Nations on the right course for the rest\r\nof the century. The Kingdom of Swaziland stands ready\r\nto play its full part in the process.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Andrés\r\nPastrana Arango, President of the Republic of\r\nColombia.\r\nPresident Pastrana Arango (spoke in Spanish):\r\nI come to this historic Summit today not only as\r\nPresident of my country, but also as the voice of 500\r\nmillion inhabitants of this planet who live in the 33\r\nStates of Latin America and the Caribbean that form\r\nthe Rio Group, of which I am today the Secretary pro\r\ntempore.\r\nIn their name, I proclaim the following.\r\nWe aspire to be, above all, a region of peace.\r\nWe value the protection of human rights, in their\r\nfull concept, and of the environment, since protecting\r\nboth is a way of defending man.\r\nWe reject all forms of intolerance and\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nWe exalt solidarity and cooperation as the values\r\nthat should guide us in the twenty-first century.\r\nAnd we therefore declare that the United Nations\r\nis the most important world Organization, and it is our\r\nduty to strengthen and increase its capacity. We\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\ntherefore support a multilateralism that always acts\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations as the\r\nprime regulator of world order, and we consider\r\nunacceptable any international action taken outside the\r\nlegal framework of the Organization’s Charter or any\r\nreform that would be to the detriment of the\r\nOrganization’s social agenda.\r\nWe in Latin America and the Caribbean declare\r\nthat we are supporters of and committed to democracy\r\nand respect for human rights as the guiding principles\r\nof the new international order. This is what we, the\r\nPresidents of the Rio Group countries, asserted in\r\nCartagena when we signed a “Commitment to\r\nDemocracy”, and when all the Presidents of South\r\nAmerica ratified it less than a week ago in Brasilia.\r\nWith the authority to which we are entitled as the\r\nworld’s first major nuclear-weapon-free region, Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean strives to create a world\r\nfree of the nuclear threat and of other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We also support the upcoming\r\ninternational conference on the illicit trade in small\r\narms and light weapons, and we condemn the use of\r\nexcessively cruel and inhumane weapons, especially\r\n“home-made” weapons.\r\nAvoiding war is a priority and a matter of\r\nurgency, but where conflict already exists we must at\r\nleast observe the rules of international humanitarian\r\nlaw. Colombia firmly stands by its positions, and I am\r\nproud to be able to say that today there is no one under\r\nage serving in our armed forces.\r\nIn order to secure a firmer future for generations\r\nto come, we must also show courage and determination\r\nin facing the global problem of unlawful drugs and\r\nrelated crimes such as money-laundering’ the\r\ntrafficking in and diversion of chemical precursors;\r\ncontraband; and arms dealing. The Rio Group is\r\nconvinced that this is a problem for all, and that it must\r\nbe solved by all in a global effort which should be\r\nbased on the principle of shared responsibility.\r\nIt is our duty to foster the conditions so that the\r\nglobalization process of the last 10 years can be\r\ncontrolled, humanized and made equitable. In these\r\nnew circumstances, trade and finance cannot lose sight\r\nof human beings and their needs. In Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean there are more than 200 million poor\r\nwho hope to share the benefits of progress, and we\r\ncannot leave them behind. What we seek is growth\r\nwith social equity.\r\nFor this, we need international cooperation to\r\nfinance the networks of social protection and the\r\ninvestment in human capital and the infrastructure. We\r\nneed to increase the flow of international trade and put\r\nan end to the protectionist measures of the wealthier\r\nand more developed countries.\r\nIn sum, we need a new architecture for the\r\ninternational financial system which will help to secure\r\nstability and provide assistance and support for\r\ncountries which are undergoing a process of\r\nadjustment.\r\nI come from Colombia, a beautiful country\r\ninhabited by 40 million people who love life and\r\nwhere, unfortunately, an absurd confrontation persists,\r\nfuelled by a few violent persons and by tainted drug-\r\ntraffic money that affects and involves the entire world.\r\nBut we are committed to the quest of a negotiated\r\npeace. We are possessed by a desire to achieve greater\r\nsocial justice for our most needy. We are determined to\r\ncombat drug-trafficking and to fight for human rights.\r\nWe have been living in democracy for over 180 years\r\nand we shall continue to live in democracy. We are the\r\nfuture. We are the promise. We are a land of hope and\r\nfriendship. On the shoulders of our heroes, suffering\r\nthe anguish of our poor, trusting in the talents of our\r\npeople, we are, in the words of our Nobel laureate\r\nGabriel Garcia Marquez, striving for a second chance\r\non the earth, and I have no doubt that we shall\r\nobtain it.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Gustavo Noboa Bejarano, Constitutional President\r\nof the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nPresident Noboa Bejarano (spoke in Spanish):\r\nSince its creation the United Nations has been a\r\nuniversal meeting place of States to work for the\r\nshared ideals and objectives of all peoples. Today it is\r\nwelcoming the largest number of heads of State and\r\nGovernment from all the regions of the world. This\r\nundoubtedly constitutes an acknowledgement of the\r\nfull validity of the multilateral system of relations\r\namong States when, in the globalized world, the\r\nindividual action of Governments yields to the\r\ncollective treatment of global policy and strategies for\r\neffective and united management of international\r\naffairs.\r\nThe globalization process is developing\r\nindependently of the great objectives of security,\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\neconomic stability and development. The debt problem\r\nand the financial market crises have weakened the\r\npossibilities of economic stability and development.\r\nThe causes of alarming levels of poverty and misery in\r\nthe majority of countries are increasingly found beyond\r\nnational borders and a nation’s control, since\r\nGovernments have less leeway to apply policies that\r\nmitigate unemployment and inequality, heightened by\r\nexternal circumstances and by non-humanitarian\r\nglobalization. Violence, drug trade, terrorism and the\r\ndeterioration of the environment have all burst forth as\r\nglobal phenomena that threaten all humankind, and\r\ninternational measures have not yet been taken to offset\r\nthe effects of a system which for now is clearly one of\r\nprofit and fierce competition and is dehumanizing in its\r\nvery essence.\r\nIn recent years we have been witnesses to the\r\nworsening of regional conflicts. Wars have left deep\r\nand lasting scars in different parts of the world. Grave\r\nviolations of basic human rights and international\r\nhumanitarian law remain in evidence. The stockpiling\r\nand unjustifiable development of nuclear weapons and\r\nother weapons of destruction continue as a constant\r\nthreat to humankind.\r\nThe successes of the United Nations throughout\r\nits years of existence place great expectations on its\r\nperformance in the twenty-first century. Our ability to\r\nstrengthen the Organization to respond to new\r\nchallenges depends on the historic commitment that we\r\nare able to offer today to the Organization and to\r\ncollective action for the benefit of a universal project\r\nof change, understanding and cooperation. Overturning\r\nthe negative trends of globalization is the new\r\nchallenge of the United Nations.\r\nWorking hard for the overall development of its\r\nnation, Ecuador firmly appeals to international\r\ncooperation for the implementation of programmes\r\naimed at debt alleviation and reduction of the external\r\ndebt for developing countries that are highly indebted.\r\nDebt-servicing, consuming over 50 per cent of the\r\nnational budget in some countries, conspires against\r\nthe implementation of health, education, employment\r\nand environmental programmes and programmes for\r\nthe well-being of the poorest segments of the\r\npopulation. Ecuador urgently calls for agreements to\r\nforgive the heavy external debt. Moreover, emphasis\r\nmust also be placed on international financing for\r\ndevelopment on a foreseeable and continued basis. We\r\nmust also ensure effective assistance through the\r\nresources of international institutions.\r\nWith regard to efforts to renew the United\r\nNations, Ecuador also attaches priority to the reform of\r\nthe Security Council in its composition and its working\r\nmethods. Its primary mission in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security requires adaptations to\r\ncorrect imbalances in its present composition so as to\r\nimprove decision-making mechanisms and to give\r\ngreater transparency to its proceedings.\r\nI am pleased to reaffirm at this Summit Ecuador’s\r\nfirmest support for the multilateral system of\r\ninternational relations and for this universal\r\nOrganization, the United Nations. We have begun a\r\nnew millennium and the hope of humankind to live in a\r\nmore secure, just and democratic world, depending on\r\nthe shared action of all countries, which puts our\r\nuniversal political will, solidarity and commitment to\r\nthe test.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique.\r\nPresident Chissano: It was with great pride and\r\nsatisfaction that we in Mozambique received the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on the Millennium\r\nAssembly and realized that it touches upon the most\r\npressing challenges faced by the peoples of the world\r\ntoday. These include the promotion of a culture of\r\npeace within and among nations and among regions\r\nthroughout the world, for this will allow the\r\naccomplishment of all other objectives such as poverty\r\neradication, development, human rights, promotion and\r\nprotection, as well as meeting the challenges of\r\nglobalization. Developing countries, particularly the\r\nleast developed ones, are facing serious difficulties in\r\ntheir efforts to integrate themselves into the world\r\neconomy. By liberalizing trade and finance, the\r\nglobalization process has exposed the poor countries to\r\npowerful external forces and has driven them to\r\nmarginalization and exclusion. This results in serious\r\neconomic asymmetries, leading to a widening gap\r\nbetween the rich North and the poor South, not only in\r\neconomic terms, but also in terms of technology and\r\nknowledge, a trend leading to greater inequalities.\r\nThe alarming figures on poverty in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report are indeed embarrassing to us as world\r\nleaders. Looking at the stage of development the world\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nhas reached today, with some societies living in\r\nconditions of extreme abundance, the prevalence of\r\nabsolute poverty in the world is morally unacceptable.\r\nWe have to reverse the current trend in the international\r\neconomic system and create one which brings about\r\njustice, equal opportunities and benefits for all peoples\r\nin the world. If the scourge of poverty is not addressed,\r\nit can shake the very foundations of the current\r\ninternational system. We therefore call upon the\r\ninternational community to harness and manage the\r\nglobalization phenomenon in order to ensure that all\r\npeoples of the world benefit from it.\r\nExternal debt is a major obstacle to the economic\r\ngrowth and sustainable development of developing\r\ncountries. While we welcome the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) and the Cologne initiatives, as\r\nwell as other mechanisms for debt relief, we are\r\nconvinced that unconditional debt cancellation could\r\nenable us to redirect resources to poverty eradication,\r\nthe improvement of social sectors and the rehabilitation\r\nof basic infrastructures. Debt cancellation needs to be\r\nsupplemented by better access to world markets, the\r\nprovision of adequate development assistance, and\r\nforeign direct investments.\r\nWe consider the eradication of infectious diseases\r\nsuch as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS a key\r\nissue for the development and security of the\r\ndeveloping countries, especially of the African\r\ncountries. In my country, we have established a\r\nnational committee that involves all stakeholders in the\r\nimplementation of the programme to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThe advancement of knowledge, science and\r\ntechnology — in particular information and\r\ncommunication technology — are essential for\r\neconomic growth and development. The lack of access\r\nto technology widens the gap between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. Therefore, technology should be\r\nmade available to developing countries at affordable\r\nprices, with adequate human capacity-building to\r\nenable them to appropriate and further develop it to the\r\nbenefit of their peoples.\r\nOur desires and aspirations can be realized only\r\nin a stable and peaceful environment. It is essential that\r\nefforts be intensified in the search for genuine\r\ndisarmament, including the total destruction of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\r\nweapons. Illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\r\nshould be prevented through concerted international\r\nefforts.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in the maintenance\r\nof peace and international security must be\r\nstrengthened. The Security Council has to be\r\ndemocratized.\r\nI would like to take this historic opportunity to\r\nexpress my sincere gratitude and that of the people of\r\nMozambique to individual countries and the\r\ninternational community as a whole for the response\r\nand support provided to us during the devastating\r\nfloods in which many lives were lost and\r\ninfrastructures destroyed. Although factors beyond our\r\ncontrol have conditioned its pace, we have already\r\nstarted with the post-flood reconstruction. I am happy\r\nto report that most families that were displaced by the\r\nfloods have been resettled in safe areas. We thank the\r\ninternational community for the efforts deployed to\r\nassist us in this phase of reconstruction.\r\nMozambique has, to a large extent, experienced\r\nthe positive impact of an effective and coordinated\r\naction by the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity at large, in times both of peace and of\r\nconflict. It is our earnest hope that the United Nations\r\nwill be reformed as soon as possible and strengthened\r\nin such a way that its effectiveness is enhanced. The\r\nimplementation of the decisions to be adopted at this\r\nhistoric Summit requires the establishment of follow-\r\nup mechanisms or reinforcement of the existing ones.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, President of the Republic of\r\nKazakhstan.\r\nPresident Nazarbaev (spoke in Russian): It is\r\nquite clear that the new millennium not only is\r\nbringing us global changes but that it also marks a\r\nwatershed in the existence of humankind. There is no\r\nquestion that globalization is a dominant and\r\nirreversible trend of our time. However, today it is also\r\nunquestionable that globalization, which is shaping the\r\ncontours of the new world order and is clearly a\r\nmanifestation of progress, can also have quite a few\r\nnegative implications for many, if not most, States.\r\nThere are a number of factors at play here, chief\r\namong them being the stark inequality between States\r\nof the world community. This is reflected even in the\r\nwords we use on a daily basis to express the varying\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\ndegree of that inequality. Thus, we speak of “rich” and\r\n“poor” States, “developed” and “economically\r\nbackward” States, nations endowed with a resource\r\npotential and those that have already exhausted it, and\r\nso forth.\r\nInequality also manifests itself in the pattern of\r\nresource consumption. Developed countries, known to\r\naccount for 20 per cent of the world’s population,\r\nconsume 80 per cent of global resources. There is also\r\na widely known forecast to the effect that, given the\r\ncurrent pace of development, the global economy over\r\nthe next few decades can provide employment for only\r\n20 per cent of the world’s able-bodied population. And\r\nthis is only one of the global challenges of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nIn this context, I believe that both the United\r\nNations and national Governments must make mutual\r\ncommitments. First, each country should clearly and\r\nresponsibly define its position with respect to\r\nglobalization processes in order to envision and, as far\r\nas possible, neutralize their possible negative\r\nmanifestations. Secondly, as part of its work to\r\nmodernize its activity, the United Nations could\r\nundertake the priority task of developing a model of\r\nglobalization that would integrate to the fullest degree\r\nthe interests of all marginalized countries. At the same\r\ntime, it should more adequately address the concerns of\r\nmost peoples in the developed countries, since the\r\ndisparities within those countries will inevitably\r\ncontinue to grow. This model should also incorporate\r\nmeasures to enhance the effectiveness of existing\r\nsecurity systems and develop new ones that would\r\nmeet the demands of our times. It is no secret that,\r\ndespite some major accomplishments, the United\r\nNations has not always been successful in addressing\r\nthe challenges of maintaining peace and security.\r\nIn this regard, along with enhancing the\r\npeacemaking potential of the United Nations, first and\r\nforemost of the Security Council, it could be a very\r\npromising endeavour to utilize the potential of regional\r\nsecurity systems and to promote cooperation with\r\nthem. There is no doubt that such arrangements as the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nor the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\r\nbuilding Measures in Asia, which is already taking\r\nconcrete shape, or the Shanghai Five, could in many\r\ncases function quite efficiently. The active involvement\r\nof regional security systems in the processes of\r\nmaintaining stability and security could also help take\r\nthe edge off the problem of humanitarian intervention.\r\nWith their assistance and the support of the Security\r\nCouncil, many conflicts could be resolved without\r\ngross interference in the internal affairs of sovereign\r\nStates.\r\nA pressing need to develop such approaches is\r\ndemonstrated, among other things, by the process\r\ncurrently under way in Asia. Afghanistan has become\r\none of the sore point spots of the world. More than 20\r\nyears after the intervention of the Soviet troops, the\r\nlong-suffering people of this country continue to\r\nexperience all the horrors of war. The instability and\r\npoverty in this country have turned its territory into a\r\nbreeding ground for extremism and international\r\nterrorism, spreading not only in Central Asia but\r\nthroughout the world. Afghanistan produces up to\r\n3,000 tons of raw opium annually, which is then\r\nprocessed and shipped to Europe and the United States.\r\nAt their recent meeting in Bishkek, the leaders of\r\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as\r\nwell as Russia, discussed this problem and called on\r\nthe United Nations and the world community to\r\nprovide their countries assistance in normalizing this\r\nsituation. We believe it is necessary to convene a\r\nspecial meeting of the Security Council devoted to the\r\nsituation in Afghanistan and Central Asia to develop\r\npractical measures to stabilize the situation.\r\nThe threat of nuclear proliferation could also be\r\nincluded on its agenda, since a strong confrontation has\r\ndeveloped among some nuclear-weapons States. A\r\nnumber of countries of the region are at the threshold\r\nof acquiring these weapons. After the disintegration of\r\nthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Kazakhstan\r\ninherited a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons. Our\r\ncountry has set a precedent by a voluntary renouncing\r\nof this arsenal. That is why today we again call on all\r\nnuclear-weapon States to take concrete measures to\r\neliminate nuclear arms.\r\nAs an improvement of the activity of the United\r\nNations in the era of globalization, we believe it would\r\nbe advisable to promote within its structure such\r\ninstitutions which, on the basis of a global analysis of\r\nthe situation, could provide early warning about\r\nemerging conflicts, formulate recommendations for\r\nearly intervention and prevent military solutions to\r\nconflicts while effectively promoting preventive\r\ndiplomacy. Such institutions could become an\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nirreplaceable tool for addressing social and economic\r\nproblems that are the source of instability.\r\nIn late 1943, at the Teheran Conference, where\r\nthe question of the future world order was first\r\ndiscussed, a great American, President of the United\r\nStates Franklin Roosevelt, addressed the participants in\r\nthe Conference with these words:\r\n“We have differing customs and\r\nphilosophies and ways of life ... But we have\r\nproved here in Teheran that the varying ideals of\r\nour nations can come together in a harmonious\r\nwhole, moving unitedly for the common good of\r\nourselves and of the world.”\r\nI think that this statement is relevant for us too, as\r\nwe stand on the threshold of the twenty-first century, a\r\ncentury of dramatic changes, a century of globalization\r\nwhich, we all hope, will bring common good to\r\nhumanity as a whole.\r\nThe world has become a global and\r\ninterdependent place where global partnership should\r\nbecome an overriding principle.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of\r\nSenegal.\r\nPresident Wade (spoke in French): On this\r\nhistoric occasion where the United Nations community\r\nis meeting to celebrate the advent of a new millennium\r\nand to reflect together on what should be the role and\r\nplace of the Organization in the twenty-first century, I\r\nwish to bring you a solemn message of peace and\r\nfriendship from the people of Senegal, and at the same\r\ntime to express, once again, our deep attachment to the\r\nnoble ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\r\nI wish above all to pay strong tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for the courage, competence and lucidity which\r\nhe has displayed in the exercise of his mandate. The\r\nreport he submitted to us provides us with a broad\r\nrange of ideas and relevant proposals, providing a\r\nconsensus view of the United Nations, firmly\r\ncommitted to the pillars of its Charter, and at the same\r\ntime, better equipped and adapted to the changing\r\nrealities of the world.\r\nFor my part, I wish to take up here three aspects\r\nof the problems faced by the United Nations. The first\r\nchallenge is that of establishing global and sustainable\r\npeace and security between nations, but also within the\r\nnations themselves — security going hand in hand with\r\nthe elimination of war, violence, hunger, thirst,\r\noppression, poverty and debt.\r\nThe Member States have a prime responsibility to\r\ncreate the minimum conditions for “a world free of\r\nfear”, according to the words of the Secretary-General.\r\nLet us therefore agree to establish a world based on the\r\nacceptance of the universality of the principles of\r\ndemocracy, the sovereign right of peoples to freely and\r\ndemocratically choose their leaders, the renunciation of\r\nviolence as a method of gaining and maintaining\r\npower, and the rule of law, the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights throughout the world,\r\nwithout any discrimination of gender, race or religion.\r\nIn this regard, I am thinking of all those\r\nminorities, somewhere in the world, whose cultures\r\nand rights are still being scorned, including their right\r\nto live as free citizens.\r\nDecades ago, I had a dream that Africa would\r\ncross into the twenty-first century free of all dictatorial\r\nor personal power, and with a rich mosaic of genuine\r\ndemocracies, differing only in their cultural elements.\r\nWe need to recognize, however, that instances of real\r\nchange, which includes changes in leadership and\r\nelections, can be counted on the fingers of one hand.\r\nThe second aspect in the United Nations\r\nproblems adds a complementary dimension to those of\r\npeace and security, and this is social and economic\r\ndevelopment — development in a world which is\r\ntransforming on a global level. And here too, I wish, as\r\nbefore, to mention the debt, this infernal mechanism\r\nwhich developed countries have locked us into. Each\r\ngeneration works to pay off the debts incurred by\r\nprevious generations, as well as debts of its own, debts\r\nfor which it is difficult to see any significant trace in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe drama of the debt is not that it will neither be\r\npaid back or cancelled, because these always happen.\r\nThe debt is a recurring disease which will always come\r\nback if the profound causes are not eradicated. It seems\r\nsomething like an indecency, or even a challenge to\r\ncommon reason, to consider debt development the only\r\npossible choice for our countries.\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nAt the Lomé Summit, the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) decided to establish the African Union\r\nand to take up the question of debt relief for Africa.\r\nThe world has to cease being a world where\r\npaternalist creditors are facing shivering, timid debtors,\r\nwho only dare to ask for more time or debt\r\ncancellation, whereas they are the victims of an unjust\r\nsystem. The science of economics, supported by a\r\nprofound feeling of solidarity and interdependence,\r\nshould lead the international community to share the\r\nfeeling so well expressed by John Fitzgerald\r\nKennedy — “a free society which is unable to help its\r\npoor majority will not be able to save its rich\r\nminority”.\r\nThese issues are reflected in the decision of the\r\nOAU to create the African Union. I am happy to\r\nannounce that Senegal has ratified this agreement, and\r\nwas the second nation to do so.\r\nThe third and last element of response is linked to\r\nreform of the United Nations, that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral presented in a bold programme for renewal. I\r\nfeel that the one of the first demands of reform lies in\r\nincreasing the number of permanent and non-\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, and in the\r\nimprovement of the working methods of the Council.\r\nIt is in all our interests that the Council be more\r\nrepresentative of the international community, which\r\nrequires the reform of the Security Council, the\r\nstrengthening of the rule of the General Assembly, the\r\nrationalization of the work of the other organs, as well\r\nas the simplification of the institutional mechanisms\r\nand administrative procedures.\r\nBeyond the symbolism of passing from one\r\ncentury to another and from one millennium to the\r\nnext, we are today at the crossroads and have no other\r\nchoice but to embark on the path of hope, which leads\r\nthrough the consolidation of multilateralism and\r\nuniversalism. As we meet here today, the daily realities\r\nof the world remind us yet again of the unfulfilled\r\nnature of our ambitious mission to build peace and\r\npromote development throughout our planet.\r\nWe cannot fail. We should not fail, because\r\nhumanity has accumulated an unprecedented stock of\r\nscientific knowledge, technical know-how and\r\ntechnologies able to produce way beyond our needs.\r\nGood sense rejects the idea of poverty in a world where\r\nglobal wealth is so abundant that, beyond any concept\r\nof redistribution, the elimination of waste alone would\r\nmost probably eradicate hunger and the lack of\r\nhumanity’s basic needs on most of the planet.\r\nIn the face of what borders on intellectual\r\nblindness, I wish to express my hope for the emergence\r\nof a new rationalism, such as that of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. I myself will seek membership in that society\r\nwithout borders, where absurdity will be abolished and\r\nintelligence and the rule of reason, which are optimally\r\ndistributed among peoples, will be promoted. Just as\r\nwe speak of the age of enlightenment, we might also\r\nrefer to the millennium of enlightenment. In the\r\nmeanwhile, however, may the Lord help and guide us\r\non our way.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Kim\r\nDae-jung, President of the Republic of Korea.\r\nPresident Kim (spoke in Korean; interpretation\r\nfurnished by the delegation): It is a great privilege for\r\nme to have this opportunity to speak in this honoured\r\nHall of peace.\r\nThe new millennium is beginning with a miracle\r\non the Korean peninsula. Warm sunshine has begun to\r\nmelt the wall of ice that has stood between the South\r\nand North during the past 55 years of cold-war\r\ndivision. Members must have seen some of the\r\ntelevised scenes of the South-North Korean summit in\r\nJune, as well as of the separated families reuniting on\r\n15 August for the first time in all those years of\r\nnational division. They were miraculous and were\r\nbrought about not only through the efforts of South and\r\nNorth Korea, the principal parties, but also through the\r\nsteadfast support and encouragement of the United\r\nNations and the leaders of the world. I thank them all\r\nwholeheartedly.\r\nFurthermore, I am greatly encouraged by and\r\ndeeply grateful for the decision of the Co-Chairpersons\r\nof our historic gathering to issue a statement in support\r\nof the South-North Joint Declaration that the inter-\r\nKorean summit produced.\r\nUpon my inauguration two and a half years ago, I\r\nembarked upon my sunshine policy in pursuit of inter-\r\nKorean peace, reconciliation and cooperation. Since\r\nthen, the policy has won the support of the United\r\nNations and all countries of the world. In the summit\r\ndiscussions, I and my North Korean counterpart\r\nresolved to work together to ensure that there shall\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nnever be another war on the Korean peninsula. We\r\nagreed that unification neither by force nor by\r\nabsorption is acceptable, as both would only lead to\r\nwar.\r\nWe agreed that, while the aspiration towards\r\nunification through self-determination will continue to\r\nguide us, our efforts for now must focus on bringing\r\nlasting peace to the Korean peninsula and promoting\r\neconomic and sociocultural exchanges and cooperation\r\nbetween the two sides. These efforts are already under\r\nway in many areas.\r\nUnification is the ultimate goal of the Korean\r\npeople. However, unification must be achieved\r\npeacefully, no matter how long it takes. Unification\r\nmust be a success for both sides. This was the\r\nagreement reached at the South-North Korean summit.\r\nThrough exchanges of summit visits and continued\r\nministerial talks, we will do all that we can to expand\r\ninter-Korean exchanges and cooperation and to make a\r\npeace to last on the Korean peninsula. Such advances\r\non the Korean peninsula will greatly contribute to\r\npeace in north-east Asia and the world.\r\nAs long as we have the United Nations leading\r\nthe global support for our efforts on behalf of peace,\r\nwith the active backing of all the leaders here, the\r\nmiracle of the new millennium unfolding on the\r\nKorean peninsula will become a great achievement for\r\nhistory. In the most earnest terms, I ask representatives\r\nfor their abiding attention and support.\r\nIn the twentieth century, the United Nations\r\nachieved shining advances for peace and human\r\nwelfare. Were it not for the United Nations, how much\r\nmore would humankind have suffered from wars,\r\ncalamities and infringements upon human rights.\r\nIndeed, I harbour no doubt that the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations was humanity’s greatest feat of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, however, there will be\r\nmany and even greater missions for the global body to\r\naccomplish. Numerous challenges await, such as the\r\nrealization of world peace, assistance for the economic\r\ngrowth of the developing countries, the promotion of\r\nhuman rights, combating terrorism, and the\r\npreservation of the earth’s environment. These\r\nmissions must all be successfully accomplished.\r\nI appeal to all: let us join hands to make the\r\ntwenty-first century the most peaceful and hopeful\r\nperiod in the history of humankind. Let us do so by\r\nhaving the countries of the world rally around the\r\nUnited Nations. I assure them that the Republic of\r\nKorea will render all the cooperation it can as the\r\nUnited Nations carries out its noble roles.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Alija\r\nIzetbegovic, President of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nPresident Izetbegovic: First, let me thank the\r\nUnited Nations for organizing this historical gathering.\r\nWe extend our congratulations to all those contributing.\r\nWe fully endorse the efforts for a more efficient\r\nOrganization of the United Nations that would\r\nsuccessfully promote the values contained in the draft\r\ndeclaration of the Millennium Summit.\r\nCompared to our long and rich history, the dawn\r\nof the new millennium closes an extremely difficult\r\nand painful decade for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\r\nfirst half of the decade was marked by a battle for\r\nindependence and the other half by the reconstruction\r\nof the country and its institutions after a bloody and\r\ndevastating war. The country and the peoples have\r\nsurvived, but at a terrible and unnecessary price.\r\nThe future of Bosnia and Herzegovina depends\r\nlargely on three factors: first, the integration of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina from within; secondly, the integration\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole into the Euro-\r\nAtlantic institutions; and, thirdly, on further regional\r\ndevelopments overall.\r\nThe integration from within is a painful and slow\r\nprocess, but it is headed in the right direction. I am\r\nhappy to affirm the good will of ordinary people to\r\nreconcile and to move forward. The problems are in the\r\nlack of commitment on the part of some politicians. As\r\na consequence, too many of our refugees are still\r\nwaiting to return to their homes and some remnants of\r\napartheid are still present.\r\nWe who signed the Dayton/Paris Peace\r\nAgreement to establish peace have always understood\r\nit to be imperfect. However, we also believed it to be\r\nevolutionary and a process that would establish Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina as a democratic and open member of\r\nthe family of European countries. Our integration into\r\nthe Euro-Atlantic institutions — from the Council of\r\nEurope to the Partnership for Peace and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — ensures a\r\nstable future for our overall region as well. That\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nprocess of integration is the source of our hopes. It\r\nenhances this necessary evolution and encourages the\r\nvision of a common future for our peoples. However, in\r\nthe alternative, if the people feel that they are not\r\nwelcome as full partners in a borderless Europe, the\r\ndemarcation lines in our region will become ever more\r\npronounced.\r\nIn Dayton, our priority was to stop the killing,\r\nbecause there had been too much death. We believed\r\nthat an imperfect peace would be better than a just war\r\nand that the natural integration of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina into the Euro-Atlantic family would help\r\nto overcome the shortcomings of such an initially\r\nunjust, as well as imperfect, peace.\r\nFinally, the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nalso depends on regional developments, and vice versa.\r\nMost recent developments in Croatia have shown how\r\nquickly things can change in a positive direction. We\r\nwould like to see similar positive events with our\r\nneighbour to the east. In Montenegro democracy and\r\nthe recognition of past mistakes go hand in hand. The\r\nrelationship between our two countries reflects new\r\nfeelings of goodwill and mutual interests.\r\nWe in Bosnia and Herzegovina are very proud to\r\ncontribute an integrated police force from Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to the international peacekeeping effort in\r\nEast Timor. Here I join others in expressing our dismay\r\nat the deaths of United Nations personnel in Timor.\r\nAllow me to conclude this short statement on a\r\nmore personal note. My function in the presidency of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina ends this October, after 10\r\nyears of service. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my gratitude to all sincere friends of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina who were with us in the time of war\r\nand in the time of peace, and who have always\r\nsupported the just cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I\r\nassure the Assembly of the readiness of my country to\r\ncontribute to the common well-being in order to build a\r\nbetter and more just world. As a crossroads of\r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions — Orthodox\r\nChristianity, Catholicism, Judaism and Islam — we can\r\ncontribute much to a new dialogue and culture of\r\npeace. Our example teaches what should and should\r\nnot be done. It is both a positive and negative lesson\r\nfor future generations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez, President of the\r\nRepublic of El Salvador.\r\nPresident Flores Pérez (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nthank the United Nations, through the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for the proposal at the beginning of this year\r\nthat the agenda for this Summit should be that of\r\ntackling the world’s problems. I have discussed that\r\nproposal with my Latin American colleagues at various\r\nforums, and extend deserved recognition to Mr. Annan\r\nfor it.\r\nI find in the proposal an appeal to the more\r\ndeveloped nations regarding the very acute poverty in\r\nwhich many nations and a large part of the world’s\r\npopulation live. If that appeal means a call to solidarity\r\nas part of a concept of a global conscience that\r\nunderstands that the problems of others are also our\r\nown, then I completely support it. But if it is based on\r\nthe premise that poor nations exist through the fault of\r\nrich nations, then I cannot agree with it. When the\r\nattitude of a poor nation towards the world is to blame\r\ndeveloped countries for its poverty, then there is a\r\ntransfer of responsibility that in the end closes off any\r\npossibility for that nation to emerge from its poverty.\r\nThe only possible way for a poor nation to move ahead\r\nis to assume full responsibility for confronting its\r\npoverty.\r\nWe in El Salvador are living in a time of\r\nprofound transformation because of a successful peace\r\nprocess and a reorientation of our country. The\r\ntriumphs have been ours, as we were the ones who\r\nmade peace. But the problems are also ours, as we were\r\nthe ones who made war. The only way in which we can\r\novercome our problems is by accepting them in full.\r\nThe same applies to the individual who blames his\r\nGovernment for his present living conditions, while\r\nforgetting his personal responsibilities. By transferring\r\nto others the responsibility that is ours we block any\r\npossibility for change.\r\nWe Salvadorans are the architects of our own\r\ndestiny. Ours are the triumphs and ours are the failures.\r\nIn our experience, assigning blame in the end promotes\r\nan assistance mentality whose most pernicious\r\nexpression is the temptation of many aid programmes\r\nto carry out social engineering experiments within a\r\nreality that they do not understand at all. We are\r\ntherefore not asking the world to solve our problems.\r\nWhat we are asking for is an opportunity to participate\r\non equal terms in development processes.\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nThe policies of openness promoted by\r\nindustrialized countries and international agencies are\r\nvalid as long as they mean openness for everyone. If\r\nindustrialized countries view less developed countries\r\nonly as consumer markets and close their own markets\r\nto our own capacity to produce, they create a distortion\r\nthat will in the end affect all nations. Salvadoran\r\nfarmers use all the products produced by industrialized\r\ncountries. It is absolutely intolerable for the\r\nindustrialized world to tell them that they cannot sell in\r\nthe countries of the industrialized world the fruits,\r\nvegetables and cereals they produce through their own\r\nlabour.\r\nThere is no better opportunity than this historic\r\ngathering to correct that distortion. All that is needed is\r\nour determination to raise relations between countries\r\nto the level of dignity required for a shared future.\r\nOpenness is the only sustainable link between us, as it\r\nis only on the basis of our production that we can\r\ngenerate the resources to combat poverty. I therefore\r\nview that commitment and opportunity with the utmost\r\noptimism.\r\nIf inhabitants of Europe had been told that they\r\nwere living during the Renaissance, they would\r\nprobably have answered in a perplexed manner that the\r\nonly thing they were living was the daily shared\r\nproblems of their existence at the time. It may be that\r\nwe ourselves are today living through another\r\nRenaissance, one characterized by a burst of creativity\r\nin almost all areas of human knowledge. If so, it would\r\nbe an enormous waste if we, the leaders of the world,\r\nwere to apply our energies to grim, apocalyptic visions\r\nregarding the threats that will confront mankind.\r\nMaybe the most productive way of employing our time\r\nwould be to dedicate ourselves to effectively managing\r\nthe world’s current potential in an active and\r\nresponsible spirit of optimism, understanding that\r\ntoday we have tools to move our countries forward that\r\nwe never had before.\r\nProgress is knowledge and decision — and this is\r\ndenied to no one.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Hipólito Mejía Domínguez, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic.\r\nPresident Mejía Domínguez (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe proposal to convene this Summit could not have\r\nbeen better timed or more auspicious, in that it offers\r\nan opportunity for the community of nations to engage\r\nin a fruitful process of reflection on how to meet the\r\nchallenges and needs of the new millennium.\r\nDeliberating on the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe twenty-first century means defining the\r\nexpectations which Governments must try to fulfil at\r\nthe international level, in a world that is calling\r\nincreasingly for the practice of certain values in order\r\nto promote effective solidarity among all the peoples of\r\nthe earth.\r\nWe Heads of Government should all thank the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations for organizing\r\nthis meeting and giving us this opportunity to\r\ndeliberate on the issues covered extensively in the\r\nreport which he has presented to this Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\nOnly a few days ago, on 16 August, I had the\r\nhonour to be inaugurated as Constitutional President of\r\nthe Dominican Republic. I have come to this high-level\r\nmeeting, therefore, to very briefly describe some of the\r\nhopes and aspirations of the Dominican people.\r\nDignity of the human person, equality between\r\nmen and women, social progress to improve living\r\nconditions, poverty eradication, a life of peace and\r\nhope without fear — these, briefly, are the aspirations\r\nand hopes of the Dominican people and the general\r\nframework within which the Dominican Government\r\nexpresses its willingness and its determination to\r\nensure that, in our country, the process of globalization\r\nof all humankind’s cultural manifestations that\r\ncharacterizes this new millennium will have a\r\ngenuinely human face.\r\nWhile immersing ourselves in globalization and\r\nthe market economy, we will never relinquish the\r\ndemands of equity and social justice that flow from our\r\nhopes and aspirations.\r\nIf much-vaunted macroeconomic equilibrium is\r\nto be truly beneficial and equitable, then what we need\r\nare effective State institutions, transparent management\r\nof public affairs, respect for human rights, universal\r\nparticipation in decision-making on issues of universal\r\nconcern and the creation of a sound physical\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nOnly when we are able to design policies aimed\r\nat achieving those goals will we be in a proper position\r\nto join and operate in the global economy on\r\ncompetitive, equal terms. This, I repeat, is the attitude\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nwhich defines the aspirations and hopes of the present\r\nGovernment of the Dominican Republic.\r\nMy presence at this Summit is proof and\r\nconfirmation of my country’s faith in this Organization,\r\nof which the Dominican Republic has been a member\r\nsince 1945. The Secretary-General’s report, which\r\nseeks to define the role of the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century, is guided by an obvious\r\ncommitment to reform and democracy. That is because,\r\nwhile the principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations have, over time, proved to be valid and, on\r\nmany occasions, effective, it must be admitted that the\r\npower structures created for it in 1945 cannot meet the\r\ndemands of the international relations that have\r\nevolved from the globalization process. Now, more\r\nthan ever, this Organization must serve to strike the\r\nright balance among all the States of the earth.\r\nMoreover, the necessary reform of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations must ensure that the globalization\r\nprocess benefits everyone, thereby transforming\r\nsolidarity into a norm of international conduct that\r\nhelps to uphold the general interest of the whole of\r\nhumankind.\r\nWe are surely all agreed that the main\r\nresponsibility for upholding the general interest and\r\nseeking to ensure the happiness of our peoples rests\r\nprimarily with us and with the Governments which we\r\nlead, but it is not denying that responsibility to point\r\nout that often, both in the past and nowadays, our own\r\nguilt has been compounded by the guilty complicity of\r\ncertain international interests.\r\nOn the basis of these considerations, I shall now\r\nrefer to the situation currently faced by the Republic of\r\nHaiti and the Dominican Republic. We have often\r\ndescribed the relationship between our two countries as\r\na marriage with no possibility of divorce. We realize\r\nthat it is basically Haiti’s economic situation that is\r\ncausing the daily influx of illegal immigrants from that\r\ncountry to ours, but the international community must\r\nalso realize that the Dominican Republic does not have\r\nthe capacity to shoulder the social burden represented\r\nby the presence of hundreds of thousands of our\r\nHaitian neighbours in our territory.\r\nOur Government is doing its utmost to deal with\r\nthis situation in a spirit of understanding and absolute\r\nrespect for human rights. Any incidents that may be\r\noccurring in the border area are not part of a State\r\npolicy, and I can assure you that we have taken steps to\r\ndeal with any troublesome situation.\r\nThe Government of the Dominican Republic is\r\nfully prepared to undertake jointly with Haiti\r\ndevelopment plans that will help to raise the standard\r\nof living of the residents of both countries.\r\nThe Dominican Republic will have an\r\nimmigration law that is based on rational principles,\r\napplicable to all aliens without distinction living\r\nlegally or illegally in its territory. However, it cannot\r\nsolve on its own a problem that concerns all of us and\r\nwhich only a collective decision and collective\r\nparticipation can help to solve definitively. I therefore\r\nappeal to the United Nations and my fellow Heads of\r\nState to assume our collective responsibility for\r\ntackling this serious situation.\r\nAs I said earlier, the time has come for solidarity,\r\nand it is we Governments that must vow that the United\r\nNations, faced with the process of globalization, will\r\nbe the guarantor of the healthy material and spiritual\r\ndevelopment of all peoples and that the United Nations\r\nwill be an implacable judge against violence,\r\ninsecurity, prejudice and environmental degradation.\r\nOnly thus, sharing the same hopes and aspirations, will\r\nwe have peace.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Paul\r\nKagame, President of the Rwandese Republic.\r\nPresident Kagame: With regard to the character\r\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century, we\r\nshare the general view that this noble institution is in\r\nneed of renewal and reform to enable it to enjoy wider\r\nlegitimacy. In carrying out that task, equal weight and\r\nurgency should be given to reforming other principal\r\ninstitutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nThe United Nations system and those institutions are\r\nnow faced with a far more complex social, economic\r\nand political environment than existed when they were\r\nfounded more than 50 years ago.\r\nIn Rwanda’s view, however, it is the issue of\r\nthreats to peace that requires the most urgent attention.\r\nIt is apparent that we are less threatened by world wars\r\nbut are confronted by regional and localized conflicts\r\nand tensions. We need therefore to pose a question in\r\nthat regard. Why have preventive and peacekeeping\r\nefforts been less than successful over the past decade?\r\nMany reasons have been put forward, including, for\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nexample, lack of political will, ill-defined mandates,\r\nlack of means, and so on.\r\nThose reasons may all be valid, but I want to add\r\none more factor. That is, each conflict is unique in its\r\nhistory and in its sociology, something that does not\r\noften receive the attention it deserves. Nothing short of\r\nobjective understanding of each conflict and its nature\r\ncan contribute to its management and eventual\r\nresolution. If the case of Rwanda may be cited, an\r\nadditional shortcoming is the inability or unwillingness\r\nto assist countries in post-conflict situations.\r\nInternational agencies seem more effective in reacting\r\nto humanitarian crises, but are wholly inadequate in\r\nassisting affected countries in the aftermath of\r\nconflicts. Yet, equally difficult challenges lie in the\r\npost-crisis phases, particularly in terms of economic\r\nand social reconstruction processes to permit\r\nsustainable development and thus to prevent further\r\ncycles of violence.\r\nPermit me now to make a few remarks on the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and my\r\ncountry. Until its independence, Rwanda was\r\nadministered as a United Nations trusteeship. The\r\nUnited Nations has since, to a greater or lesser extent,\r\nbeen associated with major political events in my\r\ncountry. As has been widely observed, the 1994\r\ngenocide in Rwanda must go down as one of the\r\ndarkest hours in the more than 50-year history of the\r\nUnited Nations. It was in the aftermath of that event\r\nthat the International Tribunal for Rwanda was created,\r\nand we support it in its commendable undertakings. Let\r\nme take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for commissioning a report\r\non what happened in Rwanda in 1994. I congratulate\r\nthe committee that undertook that assignment, led by\r\nthe former Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr. Ingvar\r\nCarlsson. Submitted to the Security Council, and\r\ndiscussed by the Council on 14 April 2000, that\r\npainstaking report (S/1999/1257, annex), which speaks\r\nfor itself, is clear in identifying responsibilities and\r\nways and means of assisting Rwanda in its\r\nreconstruction programmes. Let me take this\r\nopportunity also to pay tribute to the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Panel of Eminent Persons, under\r\nthe leadership of President Masire, which arrived at\r\nconclusions similar to those of the Carlsson report.\r\nThe people of Rwanda have, since 1994, sought\r\nto rebuild their society under most difficult and\r\nchallenging conditions. My Government is doing its\r\nbest to address these. But the task is not an easy one.\r\nWe have made progress, thanks to the Rwandan people\r\nand to our partnership with bilateral and multilateral\r\ninternational agencies. Both the Carlson and OAU\r\nreports have recommended to their respective\r\ninstitutions ways to make this partnership effective. We\r\nlook forward to the implementation of those\r\nrecommendations; Rwanda will continue to play its\r\npart.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Fidel\r\nCastro Ruz, President of the Council of State and of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nPresident Castro (spoke in Spanish): Chaos rules\r\nin our world, both within borders and beyond them.\r\nArbitrary laws are proffered as divine norms that will\r\nbring the peace, order, well-being and security that our\r\nplanet so badly needs: that is what they would have us\r\nall believe. Three dozen developed and wealthy nations\r\nthat monopolize economic, technological and political\r\npower have joined us here to offer us more of the same\r\nrecipes that have succeeded only in making us ever\r\npoorer, more exploited, and more dependent.\r\nThere is no discussion whatsoever of a radical\r\nreform of this worn-out institution — born more than\r\nhalf a century ago when there were but a few\r\nindependent countries — to transform it into a body\r\nthat truly represents the interests of all the peoples of\r\nthe world, an institution in which no one would have\r\nthe frustrating and anti-democratic right of veto, and to\r\nundertake a healthy process of expanding the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and enhancing its\r\nrepresentativeness as an executive body subordinate to\r\nthe General Assembly, which is the organ that should\r\ntake the decisions on such crucial issues as intervention\r\nand the use of force. It must be firmly stated that the\r\nprinciple of sovereignty cannot be sacrificed to an\r\nexploitative and unfair order in which a hegemonic\r\nsuper-Power, backed by its own might, seeks to have\r\nits say on everything. That, Cuba will never accept.\r\nThe poverty and underdevelopment prevailing in\r\nthe vast majority of nations as well as the inequality in\r\nthe distribution of wealth and knowledge in the world\r\nare basically at the source of the present conflicts. It\r\ncannot be overlooked that the current\r\nunderdevelopment and poverty are the consequences of\r\nthe conquest, the colonization, the enslavement and the\r\nplundering of most countries of the planet by the\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\ncolonial Powers, of the emergence of imperialism and\r\nof the bloody wars to divide up the world in new ways.\r\nToday, it is the aggressor countries’ moral obligation to\r\ncompensate our nations for the damages they caused\r\nthroughout centuries.\r\nHumanity should be aware of what we have been\r\nso far and what we cannot continue to be. Our species\r\nhas now enough accumulated knowledge, ethical\r\nvalues and scientific resources to move towards a new\r\nhistorical era of true justice and humanism.\r\nNothing in the existing economic and political\r\norder serves the interests of humankind. Thus this\r\norder is unsustainable and must be changed. Suffice it\r\nto say that the world has already more than 6 billion\r\ninhabitants, 80 per cent of whom live in poverty. Ages-\r\nold diseases of the third world — diseases such as\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and others equally lethal — have\r\nnot been eradicated, while new epidemics like AIDS\r\nthreaten to exterminate the population of entire nations.\r\nMeanwhile, wealthy countries keep devoting enormous\r\namounts of money to military expenses and to buy\r\nluxury items, and a voracious plague of speculators\r\nexchange currencies, stocks and other real or fictitious\r\nvalues for trillions of dollars every day.\r\nNature is being devastated. The climate is\r\nchanging under our own eyes, and drinking water is\r\nincreasingly contaminated or scarce. The seas, a source\r\nof human sustenance, are being depleted, and crucial\r\nnon-renewable resources are being wasted on luxury\r\nand vanities.\r\nEveryone understands that the United Nations\r\nbasic role in the new century now upon us is to save\r\nthe world not only from war but also from\r\nunderdevelopment, hunger, diseases, poverty and the\r\ndestruction of the natural resources indispensable to\r\nhuman life. And the United Nations must do this\r\npromptly — before it is too late.\r\nThe dream of having truly fair and sensible norms\r\nto guide human destiny seems impossible to many.\r\nHowever, we are convinced that the struggle for the\r\nimpossible should be the motto of this institution that\r\nbrings us together today.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): I thank the\r\nPresident of the Council of State and of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, President of the\r\nGabonese Republic.\r\nPresident Bongo (spoke in French): At this time\r\nwhen the nations of the world that we represent here\r\nare preparing to launch headlong into the third\r\nmillennium, it is appropriate to reflect together on the\r\nfuture role the United Nations will play in meeting our\r\nnew challenges.\r\nI would like, therefore, to welcome and\r\ncongratulate both of you — eminent individuals —\r\nwho have been chosen to co-chair, in the spirit of\r\nsolidarity and complementarity, this historic Summit.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate the Secretary-General\r\nfor the relevant proposals that he has brought to our\r\nattention. They well serve to remind us of the large\r\nproblems facing the world today. I am thinking here of\r\nthe armed conflicts, AIDS and poverty that are\r\nseriously threatening the stability and development of\r\nour nations — in Africa in particular.\r\nThe conflicts that Africa is experiencing have\r\ngone on for so many years that we can talk about a\r\npermanent state of war. These conflicts disrupt our\r\nsocial, family, cultural and environmental balance.\r\nThey destabilize our economies, compromise our\r\ndevelopment, hamper our freedoms and give rise to\r\ntrue humanitarian disasters.\r\nIn Africa humanitarian action is only in its\r\ninfancy. We need to develop it with the ongoing\r\nsupport of the United Nations institutions and of the\r\nMember States, as well as with the support of the\r\ninternational-level non-governmental organizations\r\nwhich are already providing us valuable assistance.\r\nAnother problem that is threatening the stability\r\nof the continent is AIDS, which is attacking our\r\nworkforce and the very structure of our societies. The\r\nfight against AIDS requires more intense international\r\ncooperation to adapt the prevention, treatment and\r\nscientific research programmes to the urgency and\r\nbreadth of the task. Here I would just like to make an\r\nurgent appeal to facilitate access to care.\r\nI feel convinced that our efforts to build a more\r\npeaceful and prosperous world will be successful if we\r\ncontinue to integrate them in a global logic of\r\ndevelopment. It is, moreover, in this spirit that the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights attaches as\r\nmuch importance to economic, social and cultural\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nrights as it does to civil and political freedoms. It is\r\nthus of the greatest importance that the international\r\ncommunity take the concerns of the vulnerable strata of\r\nour societies into greater consideration.\r\nAnother challenge that we need to meet is\r\ndeveloping and providing access to science and new\r\ntechnologies. Here too, Africa, more than any other\r\nregion of the world, will need special support.\r\nThe reform of our Organization fully falls within\r\nthe current global context whose chief characteristic on\r\nthe economic level is globalization. It also falls into the\r\npolitical framework through the march of values and\r\ndemocratic practice on all continents.\r\nIn our desire to give new dynamism to the United\r\nNations, this democracy, representative of the majority\r\nand respectful of the minorities, must inspire our\r\nthinking. It is why I would not wish to conclude my\r\nstatement without mentioning here Security Council\r\nreform. Indeed, 14 October 1977, at this very rostrum,\r\nas the then President of the Organization of African\r\nUnity, I asked that Africa have permanent\r\nrepresentation on the Security Council. I call for the\r\nrealization of this proposal, and I was very pleased to\r\nhear my brother, President Wade, speaking along these\r\nlines.\r\nI conclude my statement on this note, convinced\r\nthat as a result of this Summit, our Organization will\r\nemerge strengthened and more effective and that new\r\nand stronger solidarity will be born among States and\r\nthe peoples.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus.\r\nPresident Clerides (Cyprus): The Millennium\r\nAssembly, which rightly has gathered here an\r\nunprecedented number of heads of State and\r\nGovernment, is indeed a truly historic event. It is a\r\nsignificant effort to mobilize the forces of international\r\ncooperation at the highest possible level, an effort\r\nwhich we sincerely hope will give a strong impetus to\r\nthe desire of humankind to construct a more just and\r\nsecure world that will guarantee the survival,\r\ndevelopment and prosperity of the peoples of our\r\nplanet.\r\nAllow me to express my congratulations to those\r\nwho initially conceived the idea of the Millennium\r\nAssembly, and to thank particularly His Excellency the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his thought-provoking report entitled “We\r\nthe peoples”. We look forward to an action-oriented\r\nfinal document of this important meeting, which will\r\nprovide the blueprint for our common efforts in\r\naddressing the challenges that lie ahead.\r\nWe recognize that despite the many positive\r\ndevelopments that have occurred on many fronts,\r\nruthless conflicts, poverty and inequality are still\r\ncommonplace in the world. The spread of endemic\r\ndiseases should be a major call for mobilization for all\r\nof us. The principles of justice and international law\r\nshould prevail when conflicts arise. Respect of human\r\ndignity and rights should be indiscriminate and\r\nunquestionable, while fundamental freedoms should be\r\nfirmly embedded in all societies.\r\nGlobalization has accelerated the proliferation of\r\nglobal transactions, the increase in productivity, trade,\r\ntechnological advances and foreign investment. It has,\r\nhowever, created new challenges such as the widening\r\nof the gap between rich and poor, including the digital\r\ndivide, the expansion of criminal networks and the\r\nillicit trafficking in narcotics and arms around the\r\nworld.\r\nThe benefits of globalization need to be equally\r\ndistributed around the world. The gap between rich and\r\npoor needs to be bridged before it widens even more.\r\nThe greatest possible emphasis should be given to the\r\nneeds of those less privileged, who are daily faced with\r\nthe spectre of hunger, disease and the lack of\r\nopportunities. This is clearly in the interest of an\r\nincreasingly interdependent world. It should not be\r\nforgotten that inequalities inexorably lead to conflicts.\r\nThe heavy burden of external debt is a major\r\ncause of concern for many countries. Imaginative\r\npolicies of debt relief is a necessary component of any\r\neffort to secure poverty eradication.\r\nThe second part of the twentieth century has seen\r\nan international effort to protect human rights. Progress\r\nhas been registered. However, we have a long way to\r\ngo in order to fulfil this lofty goal. Despite the recent\r\neconomic growth and social progress, hundreds of\r\nmillions of people still live in poverty and misery. The\r\nnatural resources of the planet are rapidly being\r\ndepleted while the environment is continually\r\ndegraded. Many countries lack access to safe drinking\r\nwater and basic sanitation. Unemployment and income\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\ninequality contribute to the deterioration of the fabric\r\nof many nations.\r\nIn particular, we should focus our efforts on\r\nsecuring the rights and setting the ground for greater\r\nadvancement of less fortunate groups of our citizens. In\r\nthis context, further efforts should be initiated in the\r\nareas of gender equality and children’s rights,\r\nparticularly of those children who so often pay a\r\ndisproportionately high price in areas of armed\r\nconflict. We should institute effective policies in the\r\npursuit of youth employment, as well as policies for\r\ndisabled people who constitute one sixth of our planet’s\r\ncitizenry and who should have the opportunity to\r\nbecome fully engaged in, and contribute to, the\r\ndevelopment of our societies.\r\nWe deeply feel the pain and agony of the families\r\nof missing persons all over the world and in my own\r\ncountry, who are waiting to be informed of the fate of\r\ntheir missing loved ones in a convincing manner.\r\nSolutions based on political expediencies or\r\nconsiderations cannot give answers to this problem, the\r\nvery existence of which constitutes an affront to the\r\nconscience of humanity. Humanitarian spirit,\r\ncommitment and action by those who are in a position\r\nto give an answer to the relatives are what is needed.\r\nFrom this forum, I wish to add my voice and\r\nstrongly appeal to all concerned to cooperate in the\r\nstruggle to end the agony and uncertainty of the\r\nrelatives of each and every missing person.\r\nThe proliferation of armed conflict calls for our\r\nimmediate attention. The ravages of war are nowhere\r\nmore evident than in Africa, where the continuous\r\noutbreak of conflicts stands as a major obstacle to\r\nprogress. Our Assembly should send a strong message\r\nregarding the need for a sustained policy of conflict\r\nprevention, peace-building, reconciliation and\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nWhile one often sees a tendency to pursue a\r\n“pragmatic” approach for the settlement of disputes,\r\nnevertheless it is our firm belief that the United\r\nNations should always act based on the solid\r\nfoundation of the principles of its Charter. This kind of\r\napproach will gain the confidence of its Members with\r\nregard to its objectivity and fairness and will lead to\r\npermanent solutions.\r\nThe Organization should always be a beacon of\r\nhope for small States that look to it for justice and by\r\nconcrete actions should alleviate their fears that\r\npolitical expediency, so often associated with the\r\nexercise of power politics, will not prevail over\r\ninternational law.\r\nSecurity Council resolutions must be respected\r\nand implemented to safeguard international legality, so\r\nthat the concept of collective security will sink deeply\r\ninto our collective consciousness and find its practical\r\napplication in full respect for the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThere is no more flagrant example of this failure\r\nin implementing resolutions adopted by the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council than the case of\r\nCyprus, where numerous resolutions have remained\r\nunimplemented for over a quarter of a century. This\r\nfailure constitutes nothing less than an affront to the\r\ninternational community and a glaring example of the\r\nprevalence of impunity.\r\nWe are now engaged in yet another effort to solve\r\nthe Cyprus problem. I will participate in the\r\nforthcoming negotiation, as always, with good will and\r\ndetermination to find a just and viable solution within\r\nthe parameters established by the United Nations\r\nresolutions, a solution that will meet the interests of,\r\nand restore and safeguard, the human rights of all\r\nCypriots, without discrimination.\r\nThe framework for the construction of a better\r\nworld is this very Organization of which we are all\r\nMembers. Our guiding principles for the attainment of\r\nthis goal are those enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter. We have the tools to proceed. What we\r\nabsolutely need, however, is the political will to move\r\nforward.\r\nLet us hope that this Millennium Assembly will\r\nstrengthen our determination to work together in a\r\nspirit of solidarity in order to achieve the much desired\r\ngoals of peaceful coexistence and prosperity in our\r\ncommon home, planet Earth.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Antonio Guterres, Prime Minister of the\r\nPortuguese Republic.\r\nMr. Guterres (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Globalization\r\nis a reality; it is not an option. But there is a choice, a\r\nchoice between allowing it to develop in an\r\nunregulated manner, leading to social exclusion and an\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nincrease of injustices at the global level, or, on the\r\nother hand, placing it under control so that its potential\r\nwill be at the service of all.\r\nThe turn of a millennium is usually a time of\r\nvisions of great Utopias. The great Utopia of our time\r\nwould be a world in peace, with full respect for the\r\nrights of human beings, with international relations\r\nbased on justice and fairness, without hunger and\r\nwithout poverty, and with a sustainable symbiosis\r\nbetween humanity and nature. It would be a world\r\npolitically structured, multipolar and balanced.\r\nUnfortunately, this is not our universe, and even\r\nto draw a picture of this Utopia seems naive.\r\nIn the face of the impossibility of great Utopias, it\r\nis important, nevertheless, to mobilize the international\r\ncommunity to build many small Utopias to enact\r\npossible reforms of the architecture of international\r\nrelations towards greater justice among individuals,\r\npeoples and generations. To regulate the globalization\r\nof economies and markets, improve world governance\r\nand re-establish the primacy of political ethics over\r\ninterests: these are the core objectives of the\r\ninternational community at the turn of the millennium.\r\nAn international agenda must be taken up — an\r\nagenda of concrete reforms. I shall talk about six.\r\nThe first is reform of the Bretton Woods system,\r\nturning it into the great regulator of the global\r\neconomic and financial system, giving it more means\r\nto intervene and a more humanized perspective\r\ncombining the guarantee of financial solidity and the\r\nprinciples of good governance with a new emphasis on\r\nthe social needs of peoples, resolving once and for all\r\nthe debt problem of the poorest countries.\r\nThe second reform is to create codes of conduct\r\nand effective forms of supervision of financial flows,\r\nhelping them to become more stable and predictable.\r\nThirdly, we should bring into the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO), with care, social and\r\nenvironmental questions.\r\nThe fourth reform is to mobilize the energies of\r\nsocieties and institutions to combat infectious diseases,\r\nsuch as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and to prevent\r\n“info-exclusion”, the so-called digital divide, that\r\nthreatens the new knowledge-based economy.\r\nThe fifth reform is to convert to firm\r\ncommitments, at the global level, the directions being\r\nprogressively defined in world forums on the\r\nenvironment and sustainable development.\r\nSixthly, we should perfect international law and\r\nthe means for its implementation in order to protect,\r\never more effectively, the sovereignty of the individual\r\nand to frame properly the right of humanitarian\r\nintervention. No aggressor should be able to count on\r\nthe complacency of the international community, nor\r\non the cynical invocation of the inviolability of its\r\nborders.\r\nIn the implementation of this agenda, due to their\r\ndimension and legitimacy, the United Nations and its\r\nagencies have a fundamental role to play.\r\nThe preparatory report to this Summit tells us that\r\ntoday humanity is united as much by the desire for\r\npeace as by the tragedy of war; as much by the\r\nspectacle of the most opulent wealth as by the most\r\nabject poverty; as much by the most creative freedom\r\nof expression as by the most brutal repression of belief;\r\nas much by the Internet as by HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies\r\ncan and should function as the principal catalyst for\r\ninternational initiatives on the promotion of peace and\r\nhuman rights, but also of health, education, the\r\nprotection of the environment, and equity in the\r\ninternational circulation and distribution of wealth and\r\nof access to information.\r\nThe reform and strengthening of the United\r\nNations itself is, therefore, a key matter for our\r\ncollective future. It should include, in my view, a\r\nprofound effort to rationalize structures and means,\r\nreorganization and expansion of the Security Council\r\nitself and the creation of an Economic Security\r\nCouncil, as a catalyst for fairness, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and employment in the world economy.\r\nAll must take their responsibility seriously in funding\r\nthe United Nations. There must be an end to the\r\nhypocrisy of asking the United Nations to do what it\r\ndoes not have the means to achieve. It is important to\r\ndemand efficiency of the Organization, but the\r\nresources necessary for it to act must also be made\r\navailable.\r\nThe decisive importance of the United Nations\r\nhas a living and eloquent symbol in East Timor. The\r\nvictory of the Timorese cause constitutes a triumph of\r\nthe rule of law over force and of international solidarity\r\nover realpolitik and indifference. At the same time,\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nEast Timor is the place where, with success expected,\r\none of the most ambitious and comprehensive\r\noperations in the history of the United Nations is being\r\ncarried out. It is a good example of the importance of\r\nimproving the mechanisms for the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nHere I would like to take the opportunity to\r\nexpress the support of my Government for the\r\nconclusions of the recently published Brahimi Panel\r\nreport (A/55/305) on peace operations and to express\r\nthe hope that there will be a constructive debate on the\r\nimplementation of its recommendations.\r\nAs the Secretary-General states in his report, the\r\nvalues on which the twenty-first century should be\r\nbased are freedom, solidarity, tolerance, non-violence,\r\nrespect for the environment and natural resources and\r\nshared responsibility. Without those values, the\r\ninternational community, which we represent here\r\ntoday, cannot move forward to a future of dignity and\r\nprosperity for each and every one of its members.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Her Excellency Sheikh\r\nHasina, Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of\r\nBangladesh.\r\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bengali;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): The full text\r\nof my address has been circulated. Now I would like to\r\nread out only the highlights from it.\r\nIn a short span of human history, the world has\r\nchanged beyond imagination. As we embark on our\r\njourney into the new millennium, hope and aspiration\r\nshould steer us in overcoming the challenges. Our great\r\nleader, the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh\r\nMujibur Rahman, led Bangladesh’s 1971 war of\r\nliberation. He wanted to establish a happy and\r\nprosperous Golden Bengal, free from poverty, hunger,\r\nexploitation and deprivation. He made a historic speech\r\nat the United Nations in September 1974 in which he\r\nemphasized the need for peace, development, justice\r\nand equality — the same challenges that we face today.\r\nAlmost a year after he made that speech, he was\r\nassassinated, on 15 August 1975, along with most of\r\nthe members of my family. My sister and I were the\r\nonly survivors, as we were abroad. The killers and the\r\nconspirators had taken away fundamental human rights\r\nand destroyed democratic values. Their evil designs\r\nhave, however, failed due to the commitment of our\r\npeople to democracy. The killers have been tried under\r\nthe laws of our land, found guilty and sentenced. Some,\r\nhowever, have managed to get refuge in foreign lands.\r\nWe firmly believe that the convicted murderers should\r\nbe returned to our land to face justice.\r\nI would like to commend Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan for his millennium report, “We the peoples”.\r\nHis proposals in the four broad areas of poverty\r\neradication, prevention of conflicts, environmental\r\nregeneration and renewal of the United Nations\r\nchallenge world leaders to generate a new form of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, we\r\nshould work unitedly to establish a just, fair, equitable\r\nand democratic global system. We need democracy for\r\ndevelopment and its equitable sharing. We should work\r\ntogether so that we can benefit from the process of\r\nglobalization.\r\nPeace is a prerequisite for development.\r\nBangladesh considers peace a fundamental human right\r\nto be attained, sustained, promoted and carried forward\r\nall the time. A threat to peace anywhere in the world is\r\na threat to peace everywhere. Thus, we call for the\r\nenthusiastic promotion of a culture of peace\r\nworldwide.\r\nEnding discrimination and protecting the weak\r\nand the vulnerable are key to achieving justice and\r\nequality. We have put special emphasis on women,\r\nchildren and the weaker sectors of society.\r\nWe have taken innovative approaches towards\r\npoverty eradication, putting the people at centre stage.\r\nThe success of microcredit programmes has been\r\nphenomenal in Bangladesh, along with advances in the\r\nspecific areas of primary education, health care,\r\npopulation programmes and women’s empowerment.\r\nWe are happy that the United Nations is looking\r\nafresh at the peace operations it undertakes. As a major\r\ntroop- contributing country over the years and as an\r\nelected member of the Security Council, Bangladesh\r\nintends to take a proactive role in making peace\r\noperations more effective.\r\nThe security and welfare of people are the core\r\nconcern of the United Nations. We must undertake\r\nsustained and concerted efforts to free our people from\r\npoverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease. While\r\nmicrocredit and other poverty alleviation programmes\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nhave been successful, much needs to be done to\r\neradicate poverty.\r\nThere has been an outbreak of a malarial-type of\r\ndisease called dengu in Bangladesh and other parts of\r\nour region. Many have been exposed to arsenic\r\npoisoning. Deadly diseases such as AIDS are spreading\r\nat an alarming pace. These maladies, which have\r\nregional and global dimensions, have to be confronted\r\nglobally.\r\nLet us all contribute to a strong and effective\r\nUnited Nations that can respond to the concerns of all.\r\nWe hope that the Millennium Summit will generate\r\nnew momentum for the United Nations, so that this\r\nOrganization will be able to provide enhanced support\r\nfor our efforts to eradicate poverty, empower people,\r\nattain population control, establish participatory\r\ndemocracy, preserve the environment, realize a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free world and promote a culture of\r\npeace.\r\nMay Bangladesh live forever. May the United\r\nNations live forever.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Pervez\r\nMusharraf, Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic of\r\nPakistan.\r\nMr. Musharraf (Pakistan): We are passing\r\nthrough momentous times in the history of mankind.\r\nJust as every dawn inspires fresh hope and a new moon\r\nis an occasion for prayer and a new year for\r\nresolutions, so also the turn of the new millennium\r\nkindles hope for the future among humanity. For the\r\nfirst time in history, vistas are in sight for sufficiency\r\nand freedom from want.\r\nIn the last century, the blossoming of human\r\ningenuity brought about a massive global\r\ntransformation. However, the most remarkable\r\nachievement was the formation of the United Nations\r\nto uphold the ideals of justice, peace and prosperity.\r\nThis body has resolved many major disputes and\r\nconflicts. In recent years, United Nations intervention\r\nhalted massive human tragedies in Bosnia and Kosovo.\r\nWherever there has been a departure from the United\r\nNations Charter and defiance of United Nations\r\ndecisions, disputes have only festered, often leading to\r\nconflict. Of these, Kashmir and Palestine are the two\r\nprime examples, but with a difference. Whereas the\r\ninternational community and this world body are\r\nseriously engaged in finding a solution to the Palestine\r\nissue, Kashmir cries for justice even after 52 years.\r\nPakistan is located in the world’s most volatile\r\nregion, where one fifth of humanity lives in a state of\r\neconomic deprivation. While the global trend is\r\ntowards economic progress through regional\r\ncooperation, South Asia is embroiled in conflict. Why\r\nthis tragedy? Only because the people of Kashmir\r\nremain deprived of justice. The consequence of this\r\ninjustice has been four wars. The region stands heavily\r\nmilitarized, even nuclearized. This situation is certainly\r\nnot of Pakistan’s making. We have been obliged to\r\nrespond to the compulsions of our security and have\r\nmerely acted in self-defence.\r\nKashmir, the root cause of tension, has to be\r\nresolved. Ten million people of the State cannot be\r\ndenied their fundamental right to self-determination.\r\nThe savage brutalities and killing of 70,000 people by\r\n700,000 troops have only hardened their resolve. They\r\nseek the honouring of the pledges made to them by the\r\nUnited Nations. If the people of East Timor could be\r\ngiven their freedom, why not the people of Kashmir?\r\nWhen one party to a dispute is intransigent in rejecting\r\nthe use of peaceful means, the Security Council is\r\nempowered to act. The problem lies not in the Charter,\r\nbut in the lack of political will. Until we produce that\r\nwill, all talk of crisis prevention and dispute resolution\r\nwill ring hollow.\r\nPakistan stands for peace and is prepared to take\r\nbold initiatives to change the status quo through a\r\ndialogue with India at any level, at any time and\r\nanywhere. Let me confirm at this world forum that we\r\ndesire a no-war pact; we are ready for a mutual\r\nreduction of forces; and we also seek a South Asia free\r\nfrom all nuclear weapons. Pakistan shall not be drawn\r\ninto an arms race, nuclear or conventional, irrespective\r\nof provocation.\r\nPakistan remains conscious of international\r\nconcern for democracy. Our founding father, the\r\nQuaid-e-Azam, envisioned Pakistan as a modern\r\nIslamic State committed to democracy based on\r\nequality, freedom and social justice. The people of\r\nPakistan have never lost faith in democracy, but\r\nautocracy in the garb of democracy led to dishonest\r\ngovernance and the collapse of institutions. We stand\r\nsincerely committed to rebuilding and strengthening\r\nthe institutions of state to give the country genuine and\r\ndurable democracy.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nA particularly dark aspect of the misrule\r\ndamaging democracy in Pakistan has been corruption.\r\nParadoxically, we have heard long lectures on\r\ndemocracy from countries which have laws that\r\nactually encourage corruption by giving ready asylum\r\nto plunderers and facilities for the concealment of\r\nillicit wealth in secret accounts in their banks. Such\r\ntransfers will not make them much richer, but the poor\r\nwill certainly become much poorer. Corruption is a\r\ntransnational crime that calls for concerted\r\ninternational action. The United Nations should call for\r\nthe banning of the transfers of ill-gotten wealth and\r\ndemand cooperation in tracing and repatriating such\r\nfunds.\r\nThe best assurance for the consolidation of global\r\npeace lies in the economic development and prosperity\r\nof all regions and all peoples. Economic progress in\r\none region supports and complements prosperity in the\r\nother. The process of globalization and trade\r\nliberalization had raised hopes, but has caused\r\ndisappointment. Global trade regimes make the rich\r\nNorth richer and the poor South poorer. This imbalance\r\nwill further crush the developing countries under the\r\nincreased burden of debt. The North, may I caution,\r\ncannot remain unaffected and will eventually get\r\nsucked into this vortex. The developing world needs\r\nthe understanding and cooperation of creditor States\r\nand international financial institutions to dig\r\nthemselves out from under this huge mountain of debt.\r\nPakistan will continue to work with other nations\r\nfor a more effective and just United Nations, capable of\r\nrising above narrow interests to serve the greater cause\r\nof humanity. May the new millennium bring justice,\r\npeace and prosperity to all nations of the world.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Wim\r\nKok, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\nMr. Kok (Netherlands): First of all, I join the\r\nSecretary-General and others in expressing our\r\nprofound condolences to the families and colleagues of\r\nthe eight workers killed today in West Timor. It is\r\nexactly one year ago today that the Security Council\r\ndesperately tried to prevail upon the Indonesian\r\nGovernment to act against the militias that were\r\nwreaking havoc in East Timor. It is tragic to note that,\r\none year later, the same militias are still committing\r\natrocities, this time in West Timor.\r\nI want to add my voice to the voices of those who\r\nhave already paid tribute to the Secretary-General’s\r\nvisionary and action-oriented report on the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century. We, the\r\nMember States, are crucial to any success or failure of\r\nthe United Nations. Together we must determine what\r\nwe want from the Organization, and each of us should\r\nbe willing to invest politically and financially to enable\r\nthe Organization to do what we want it to do. Not only\r\ndo we need agreement on the core functions of the\r\nUnited Nations, but such agreement also requires a\r\nrealistic assessment of its ability to perform them.\r\nReforms are well under way, but we can and must\r\ndo more. At this Summit we must renew our efforts to\r\nbring prosperity, social justice and full recognition of\r\nhuman rights to all citizens of the world. Progress is\r\nneeded on the issue of Security Council enlargement\r\nand reform. Progress is also needed to put the United\r\nNations on a sound financial footing again.\r\nGlobal governance needs to be strengthened to\r\nkeep pace with the major challenges presented by\r\nglobalization. The United Nations and other\r\nmultilateral organizations and their member States have\r\na pivotal task to perform if we are ever to tackle global\r\nconcerns such as the spread of infectious diseases,\r\nincluding HIV/AIDS.\r\nClosing the gap between rich and poor is a task\r\nthat cannot be left to the market or to individual\r\ncountries. Globalization should go hand in hand with\r\nsolidarity and security for all. The Secretary-General is\r\nright when he urges us to focus on measures to achieve\r\nfreedom from want and freedom from fear. The\r\npersistence of extreme poverty is an affront to\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe second World Water Forum, held in The\r\nHague in March this year, agreed on realistic targets for\r\nachieving major improvements in the availability of\r\nsafe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. The\r\nNetherlands will continue its efforts to help achieve\r\nthese targets, as well as the development targets agreed\r\nat the major United Nations conferences, by supporting\r\nUnited Nations organizations that function well; by\r\nurging multilateral organizations to introduce\r\nperformance measurements; by promoting the\r\nformation of network alliances to ensure thematic and\r\nsectoral coordination at the global level; and, last but\r\nnot least, by continuing to make its financial\r\ncontributions.\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nEqually important is freedom from fear. The\r\nUnited Nations should be in a position to respond to a\r\ncrisis in its early stages. Improving the Organization’s\r\npeacekeeping capabilities is essential. The international\r\nrule of law needs to be strengthened. The International\r\nCourt of Justice, the Yugoslavia Tribunal and the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical\r\nWeapons — all located in The Hague — contribute to\r\nthat goal. In the near future they will be joined by the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. The Netherlands has also\r\noffered to be host country for the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Biological Weapons.\r\nOur endeavours to achieve freedom from want\r\nand freedom from fear for all should be guided and\r\nfurther inspired by the ideas in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, which draw on the United Nations Charter.\r\nFinally, I would like to re-emphasize that\r\nensuring a strong United Nations requires the\r\ncombined efforts of all its Member States. The United\r\nNations is not somebody else; the United Nations is us.\r\nThe General Assembly can count on sound\r\ncontributions and sustained efforts by the Kingdom of\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Her Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Helen Clark, Prime Minister of New\r\nZealand.\r\nMs. Clark (New Zealand): New Zealand is proud\r\nto reaffirm at this Summit its long-standing\r\ncommitment to the principles and work of the United\r\nNations. We have been a committed Member since the\r\nvery beginning of the Organization. Our Prime\r\nMinister at that time, The Right Honourable Peter\r\nFraser, played a significant role in framing the United\r\nNations Charter. The Charter has stood the test of time\r\nas a framework for the conduct of relations between\r\nStates and for the promotion of universal human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms.\r\nNew Zealand places great importance on the rule\r\nof law and on the peaceful settlement of disputes. We\r\nhave participated actively in the development of\r\ninternational law. This year we have responded to the\r\nSecretary-General’s request to Member States to sign\r\nor ratify as many of the 25 core treaties as possible. We\r\nhave also undertaken a full review of the extent of our\r\nparticipation in the international legal framework, with\r\na view to becoming party to more treaties.\r\nAs a first step in that process, at this Summit we\r\nare carrying out seven fresh treaty actions, including\r\nsignature or ratification of, or accession to, 5 of the 25\r\ncore treaties. This week, New Zealand is ratifying the\r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court;\r\nacceding to the Convention to Combat Desertification;\r\nsigning and ratifying the Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women; signing the two\r\nOptional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child, protocols on the involvement of children in\r\narmed conflict and on the sale of children, child\r\nprostitution and child pornography; and signing the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism.\r\nWe are also announcing our intention to become\r\nparty to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change by the time\r\nof Rio + 10, in mid-2002, and to the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.\r\nBy these actions we hope to demonstrate how seriously\r\nour small country takes the treaty-making process and\r\ninternational law.\r\nNew Zealand’s key preoccupations in the work of\r\nthe United Nations in the coming years will be on\r\nissues of disarmament and security, human rights, the\r\nenvironment and development. Our passion for nuclear\r\ndisarmament is well known. In the 1980s we declared\r\nourselves nuclear-free because of our belief in the\r\nimmorality of nuclear weapons and because we knew\r\nthat nuclear war would be a catastrophe for our planet.\r\nWe have also dedicated ourselves to the hard, slow,\r\npainstaking work of advancing disarmament at the\r\nmultilateral level. Years of working with others for a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty paid off. Now our goal,\r\nworking with our partners in the “new agenda”\r\ngrouping, is nothing less than the total elimination of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nThe peacekeeping work of the United Nations is\r\nalso a priority for New Zealand. My Government\r\ndeplores the murders yesterday of United Nations relief\r\nworkers in a West Timor refugee camp. I am gratified\r\nthat New Zealand peacekeepers were able to evacuate\r\nmany others to safety. I join other leaders in calling on\r\nIndonesia to act now to end this violence, and I endorse\r\nthe Security Council’s call for those responsible to be\r\nbrought to justice. New Zealand also welcomes the\r\nreport (A/55/305) of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nOperations, and looks forward to a strengthened United\r\nNations peacekeeping capacity.\r\nOn human rights, New Zealand will seek in\r\nparticular to protect and promote further the rights of\r\nwomen and of indigenous people. I also believe that\r\nthe United Nations itself can play an even greater role\r\nin the promotion of women to leadership roles within\r\nits own Organization.\r\nOn the environment, meeting our commitments\r\nunder the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change is a major\r\nchallenge for New Zealand, but it is one we are\r\ndetermined to meet. The consequences of unchecked\r\nclimate change are particularly severe for our South\r\nPacific neighbours.\r\nOn development, the priority surely for the\r\ntwenty-first century must be the needs of Africa. In\r\nAfrica, conflicts have disrupted too many nations.\r\nCrisis and poverty together have held back economic\r\ndevelopment. On top of that, the HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nhas taken a heavy toll on human life.\r\nThe problems confronting Africa are a litmus test\r\nfor the effectiveness and political will of the United\r\nNations, its member countries and of African\r\ngovernments, as the “We the peoples” report implies. A\r\nbetter combination of programmes for debt relief,\r\naccess to world markets for Africa’s products, practical\r\nassistance for economic development and HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention, and good governance can make the\r\ndifference for Africa.\r\nThank you for the opportunity to set out my\r\ncountry’s priorities for working through the United\r\nNations to meet the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. José\r\nMaría Aznar, President of the Government of the\r\nKingdom of Spain.\r\nMr. Aznar (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): How will\r\nhistory rate the performance of the United Nations? It\r\nseems most fitting at this time to pose this and many\r\nother questions: Has the United Nations effectively\r\npreserved humankind from the scourge of war? Has the\r\nUnited Nations clearly and positively influenced\r\neconomic development around the world? Is the\r\nOrganization able to manage appropriately the\r\nchallenges of globalization?\r\nIn the light of these questions, let me remind\r\nsome of the reckless critics of the Organization that we\r\nare the United Nations, and we, the Member States and\r\ntheir Governments, are the ones who influence its\r\nperformance. So it behoves us to decide what we want\r\nthe Organization to be in the coming century: whether\r\nwe want a useful tool for meeting our objectives, or we\r\nwant a very hollow forum.\r\nThe choice is ours to make. Now, as back in June\r\n1945, we need a sincere consensus on the fundamental\r\nrole of the United Nations in our time.\r\nThe original goal of the United Nations was to\r\npreserve the world from the scourge of war and\r\nremains so to this day. The Security Council is the\r\ncornerstone of a system, which strives to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security. It is therefore a\r\npriority to achieve Council reform through a broad-\r\nbased consensus, avoiding dissension among Member\r\nStates that would adversely erode its legitimacy.\r\nOther aspects of the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, its working methods and the power of veto,\r\nshould be dealt with in a most rigorous manner because\r\nalthough the central role of the Council within the\r\nUnited Nations system is beyond question,\r\nhumankind’s ethical conscience has greatly evolved\r\nover time so that the international community will not\r\nsit idle in the presence of mass-scale atrocities and\r\nhuman rights violations wherever they may occur.\r\nThe principle of state sovereignty is the mainstay\r\nof the international community and no one intends to\r\nquestion this fact. By the same token, that very\r\nprinciple may not be used as a shield behind which\r\nthose encouraging and abetting massive atrocities find\r\ncover. In our days, armed conflicts take their heaviest\r\ntoll among civilian populations, namely women and\r\nchildren. We must therefore seek and define an\r\nunderstanding of those situations in which international\r\nreaction may not be thwarted by the exercise of the\r\npower of veto.\r\nAny progress achieved by mankind during this\r\nviolent twentieth century is owing to the fact that —\r\neven at a staggering high cost — the notion has\r\nprevailed that human dignity is deemed more valuable\r\nthan the sanctity of the state.\r\nOther than maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, the United Nations has set out to achieve the\r\ngoal of economic development for all. If we are to\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nbuild a more just and equitable world we must\r\novercome poverty. The recent upsurge of economic\r\ngrowth and technological progress give us the best\r\nchance ever to achieve our goal. It would be\r\nunforgivable if we do not gather the means to do it.\r\nWe heartily support the objectives set out to this\r\nend in the Secretary-General’s report for the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nLet me in particular underline our commitment to\r\nachieving the goal set forth in the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development of directing 20 per cent of our\r\ndevelopment aid to basic sectors such as education,\r\nhealth care, housing and employment policies.\r\nThese are the tools that help primarily those in\r\nneed and lift them up from poverty. Specifically, equal\r\nopportunity in education worldwide may open new\r\ndoors for new and more confident generations. We are\r\nfully aware of the valuable role played by different\r\nsocial and civic endeavours, in particular non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, in implementing\r\ncooperation projects.\r\nThe last challenge before the United Nations, and\r\nthe most current one, is related to the amazing process\r\nof global integration driven by the new technologies.\r\nEndless possibilities are at hand for building a more\r\nindependent and evolved world. The United Nations\r\nshould enhance the many positive sides of\r\nglobalization to prevent the weakest among us from\r\nbeing left behind.\r\nGlobalization certainly creates new challenges,\r\namong which the need to protect and preserve the\r\nenvironment for future generations, the fight against\r\norganized international crime, the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal justice system, and also finding a\r\ncure for globally spread diseases.\r\nSpain will vigorously support all efforts to find\r\nconsensus solutions to all these problems and to uphold\r\nthe relevant agreements. Specifically, ratification by\r\nmy country of the Rome Treaty establishing an\r\nInternational Criminal Court is very near, and we trust\r\nthat it will be implemented promptly.\r\nThe manifold addresses during this Summit are\r\nlaying down the challenges facing our Organization in\r\nthe coming years. The Secretary-General’s report no\r\ndoubt stands as a suitable and revealing proposal for\r\nanalysis of the future. Thus, let us all be convinced and\r\ntherefore provide the means to make the United\r\nNations in the new century the indispensable and\r\nuseful tool to secure a better world for us all.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Guy\r\nVerhofstadt, Prime Minister of Belgium.\r\nMr. Verhofstadt (Belgium) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me first to thank the Secretary-General for the\r\nreport he presented for this historic meeting. It is an\r\nexcellent report, and the report that we needed. Not\r\nonly does it describe the major challenges, but above\r\nall it also sets out clear and precise objectives. Belgium\r\nfully supports it. My country commits itself here and in\r\nother international institutions of which it is a member\r\nto support all actions that can help attain those\r\nobjectives.\r\nI would like to discuss two of the major\r\nchallenges that figure in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral: the peacekeeping role of the United Nations,\r\nand the worldwide scourge of HIV/AIDS.\r\nTurning first to the Organization’s peacekeeping\r\nmissions, such missions have been on the increase for\r\nmore than 40 years now. This, indeed, has become the\r\nOrganization’s natural vocation. The net result of these\r\noperations has, unfortunately, not been positive — and\r\nI am speaking with circumspection. In many cases,\r\nthese operations have been true debacles. The darkest\r\npages were written in Rwanda, where genocide was\r\ncommitted before the indifferent eyes of us all,\r\nincluding my country. Hundreds of thousands of men,\r\nwomen and children were slaughtered. Ten Belgian\r\n“blue helmets” lost their lives in that operation.\r\nBelgium has sought to learn the lessons of that tragedy.\r\nI note with satisfaction that many of those lessons have\r\na place in the report of the Panel on United Nations\r\nPeace Operations chaired by Mr. Brahimi. Moreover,\r\nthose lessons are in line with the observations and\r\nconclusions of the Organization of African Unity on\r\nthis matter.\r\nI wish in particular to highlight the need to\r\nguarantee that the quality and quantity of the troops\r\nand equipment provided will be sufficient, on the basis\r\nof the most pessimistic scenario; to formulate clear,\r\ncredible and flexible mandates that can quickly be\r\nadapted to the situation on the ground; to involve\r\ntroop-contributing countries in the formulation of\r\nmandates; to provide the proper preparation,\r\ninformation and training to troops in peace operations;\r\nto improve resources for organization, information and\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nplanning; and to make the chain of command and the\r\nrelationship between the theatre of operations and the\r\nSecretariat less bureaucratic.\r\nBut however much to the point these\r\nrecommendations may be, even the full implementation\r\nof the Brahimi report would not be enough to prevent\r\ntragedies like those that took place in Rwanda,\r\nSrebrenica and Somalia. We would still be faced with\r\napplying the recommendations, as well as with the\r\ndifficulty of recruiting troops and with their late\r\ndeployment on the ground. We must therefore go\r\nfurther in our thinking. I believe that we need a new\r\nconcept of peacekeeping. That means forming\r\nstanding, ready-to-deploy regional peace-operation\r\ncapabilities. These, which should be of brigade size,\r\nwould be set up by the States of a region and would be\r\nmaterially and financially supported by the United\r\nNations. As members know, the European Union is\r\ncreating a rapid reaction force that will be operational\r\nin 2003. In a way, the new concept would be an attempt\r\nto make that initiative a general one by establishing a\r\nrapid reaction force in each region of the world. This\r\ncertainly would not imply the disengagement of the\r\nWestern countries; to the contrary, in addition to\r\nforming their own rapid reaction forces, those countries\r\nwould help financing the equipping and training of\r\nsuch regional capabilities — obviously, under the\r\ncontrol and responsibility of the United Nations.\r\nThe tragedy of AIDS has grown alarmingly: 36\r\nmillion human beings have been afflicted, some two\r\nthirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. As in all of\r\nhistory’s major epidemics, the uncontrolled spread of\r\nAIDS is exacerbated by poverty, ignorance,\r\ndogmatism, social exclusion and non-recognition of the\r\nrights of women — and, it must be said, by the refusal\r\nof some leaders to face the facts. The goals and time-\r\nframes set out in the report of the Secretary-General\r\nmust be met at any cost. Let us be clear: the only\r\npossibility for meeting those goals and time-frames is\r\nfor the rich countries substantially to increase the\r\nresources allocated for prevention, for the distribution\r\nof medicines and for the development of a vaccine.\r\nWith respect to access to basic treatment,\r\nBelgium has decided, in close cooperation with the\r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS), to provide four African countries with an\r\nassortment of medicines worth 250 million Belgian\r\nfrancs. Direct distribution to patients, which will begin\r\nthis year, will take place through existing primary\r\nhealth-care structures. Clearly, these basic medicines\r\nmust reach the poorest of the ill. In the same spirit,\r\nBelgium has decided to increase its budget for AIDS\r\nresearch by 150 million Belgian francs.\r\nI conclude by firmly endorsing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal to Member States to reform the\r\nSecurity Council without delay. This has been under\r\ndiscussion for seven years now, and I think it is time to\r\nconclude. To that end, it is urgent to give up positions\r\nthat are too conservative or that are utterly unrealistic:\r\nthose, for example, that defend the status quo on the\r\none hand, and, on the other, those that would open the\r\nCouncil to new categories of membership to the point\r\nwhere it would nearly resemble the General Assembly.\r\nAs members know, Belgium is coordinator of a group\r\nof Member States that has made realistic, practical\r\nproposals that would expand the Council by five\r\npermanent members and five non-permanent members,\r\nwith equitable geographical distribution. Belgium\r\nwould clearly be open to proposals along those lines.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Marco\r\nAntonio de Oliveira Maciel, Vice-President of the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil.\r\nMr. Maciel (Brazil) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation furnished by the delegation): Let me\r\nbegin by expressing our strongest condemnation of the\r\nattack by Timorese militias on the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\r\noffice at Atambua, West Timor. Our deepest sympathy\r\nand condolences go to the bereaved families, and we\r\nexpress our sincere wish that those injured may recover\r\nspeedily.\r\nIt gives me great satisfaction to convey to this\r\nhistoric Summit the greetings of the President of\r\nBrazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and of the entire\r\nBrazilian nation. I am confident that the President of\r\nFinland, Tarja Halonen, and President Sam Nujoma of\r\nNamibia, the Co-Chairpersons of the Millennium\r\nSummit, will provide inspired and firm guidance as we\r\nconduct our deliberations. I also salute Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, whose experience and breadth of\r\nvision of world affairs have been crucial to the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations.\r\nThe Millennium Summit offers a propitious\r\nopportunity to reaffirm our collective commitment to\r\ninternational peace and security, the observance of\r\nhuman rights, respect for international law, protection\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nof the environment, the eradication of poverty and the\r\nwell-being of all. These are goals that can only be\r\nachieved in the wake of economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Nations has a key role to play in\r\nachieving these objectives. There is no alternative to\r\nthe path laid out by the Organization if we are to foster\r\nthe ideals of liberty, equality, solidarity and tolerance\r\namong peoples. The United Nations has increasingly\r\nbecome an indispensable tool in our collective\r\nendeavours to overcome the challenges of the modern\r\nworld.\r\nThe establishment of the United Nations is one of\r\nthe great legacies of the twentieth century. The time\r\nhas come to revitalize it, to ensure that it mirrors the\r\ncontemporary state of global affairs and the trend\r\ntowards greater democracy in international relations.\r\nWe must reform the Security Council to make it more\r\nrepresentative, effective and legitimate. No longer can\r\nwe tolerate anachronistic decision-making structures\r\nthat are not only selective, but fail to reflect the\r\ndynamics of worldwide transformations of the last few\r\ndecades.\r\nIt is imperative to prevent the creation of an\r\nenvironment conducive to unilateral actions falling\r\noutside the framework of the United Nations Charter\r\nand international law. It is also imperative to renew\r\nwithin the United Nations the debate on the critical\r\nissue of economic, social and cultural development.\r\nBrazil shares the view of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan that extreme poverty is an affront to humanity.\r\nPoverty eradication, access to education, the supply of\r\nbasic health services and sustainable development\r\nrequire a concerted effort on the part of the entire\r\ninternational community. Globalization should be a\r\nmeans for creating a world of greater solidarity and,\r\ntherefore, a world that is less asymmetrical. We appeal\r\nto the developed countries to move ahead with debt-\r\nreduction initiatives benefiting the poorest countries.\r\nSuch measures will undoubtedly help to bring on\r\nstream educational programmes geared to the\r\nrequirements of the needy, in particular by widening\r\nthe access of poor children to basic schooling.\r\nBy the same token, the United Nations cannot\r\nremain aloof in view of the need to ensure access to\r\nscience and technology and to ensure that this access is\r\nmore democratic, so as to enable all the peoples of the\r\nworld to share in the information age. The United\r\nNations must assist in efforts to remove restrictions on\r\ndeveloping countries playing a more active role in the\r\nworld economy.\r\nAs we the leaders from all parts of the world\r\ngather to reaffirm our collective commitments, let us\r\nbear in mind the significant efforts being made to\r\nenhance coordination at the regional level. In this\r\nrespect, allow me to refer to the holding last week —\r\nfor the first time in our history — of a meeting of the\r\nPresidents of all the countries in South America. The\r\nsuccess of this “Meeting of the Presidents of South\r\nAmerica”, held in Brasilia, reinforces the prospects for\r\nthe consolidation of a regional zone of prosperity,\r\nwhere our countries will be able to address common\r\nchallenges and opportunities. I am convinced that the\r\noutcome of the gathering in Brasilia constitutes a\r\nmeaningful contribution, from our perspective, to the\r\ndynamics of regional integration, which is crucial in\r\nthese times of globalization.\r\nMr. Gurirab (Namibia) took the chair.\r\nThe Brasilia Meeting highlighted priorities of the\r\nregion. Our commitment to democracy was enhanced.\r\nWe underscored our conviction that the improvement\r\nof infrastructure geared to regional integration, the\r\nstrengthening of our trade ties, closer technical and\r\nscientific cooperation, and the fight against drug\r\ntrafficking and related crimes are decisive measures\r\nwhich will foster comprehensive regional development.\r\nFinally, as a reaffirmation of the peaceful aspirations of\r\nthe countries of the region, we agreed to establish a\r\nSouth American zone of peace.\r\nWe are convinced that the Millennium Summit\r\nwill be a watershed in our endeavours to build a better\r\nworld. If we are to achieve this goal as we enter the\r\ntwenty-first century, it is essential that we bring new\r\nvigour and strength to the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by Her Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Billie Miller, Member of Parliament,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.\r\nMrs. Miller (Barbados): In the 34 years since our\r\nindependence we have striven for nothing less than to\r\ndefine our identity out of the crucible of a history that\r\nencompasses the darkest episode in human relations.\r\nWe in Barbados and the Caribbean are, in truth, the\r\npeople of this millennium. We did not exist in the first\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nmillennium. Those who inhabited our islands then were\r\nextinguished by the desolation of early colonialism.\r\nTheir lives remain a mystery to us, decipherable only\r\nthrough a few pieces of stone and remnants of folklore.\r\nThe present people of the Caribbean are the new people\r\nof the New World.\r\nWe identify ourselves at the cusp of two\r\nmillenniums as a sovereign nation whose level of\r\nprosperity, education and well-being have been attained\r\nat high cost. We have not come to this point in our\r\ndevelopment easily or by chance, supported in every\r\naspect by preferences and special dispensations, as\r\nsome would have you believe. We come to this place\r\nand time through endeavour and sacrifice.\r\nOur expectation when we became a Member of\r\nthis Organization was that we would become part of an\r\nassemblage that would protect our territorial integrity,\r\nsupport our sovereignty and assist us in our quest to\r\nrealize the full potential of our citizens. Membership in\r\nthe United Nations, the original and largest of\r\nexperiments in multilateralism, was both practical and\r\nsymbolic for us.\r\nBarbados has a perspective on multilateralism\r\nthat is inherently positive. We understand it as\r\ninterdependence in the management and sustainable\r\ndevelopment of our planet and our peoples. We know it\r\nas offering the opportunity for collaborative decision-\r\nmaking based on shared information, and we believe in\r\nits precepts of mutual respect and mutual benefit.\r\nIt would seem, however, that these tenets are no\r\nlonger held to be sacred by all of us. Debate continues\r\non the worthiness of multilateralism as a natural\r\nevolutionary development in the relationship between\r\ncountries. The United Nations is at the heart of this\r\nargument. There is no denying that faith in the United\r\nNations to deliver on its myriad mandates is too often\r\nin doubt. Lack of trust in the system has led to apathy\r\namong the majority. This has given rise to a disquieting\r\ntendency to flout the moral authority of the United\r\nNations, endanger its agents for peace and\r\ndevelopment, and undermine its credibility and\r\neffectiveness as global arbiter and guardian of human\r\nprogress.\r\nThe experience of Barbados with multilateralism\r\nhas been diverse and pervasive. We are inheritors of\r\nmembership in the Commonwealth of Nations. Our\r\nrelations with Africa and the Pacific have been\r\nconducted largely within the unique forum of the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. In our\r\nown hemisphere we have become an integral part of\r\nthe Summit of the Americas process. And, of course,\r\nthe fraternity and interdependence between our\r\ncountries in the Caribbean Community needs no\r\namplification.\r\nIn the midst of all our positive perceptions,\r\nhowever, there is growing anxiety and unease. We have\r\nnoticed a tendency by the large and mighty members of\r\nthe world community to exploit the very laudable\r\nprecepts of the United Nations to maintain an unjust\r\nstatus quo or to impose unpalatable conditionalities on\r\npeaceful coexistence.\r\nThe list of issues that are undermining Barbados’\r\nposition in that hard-won niche we have carved for\r\nourselves continues to grow. The efforts of the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment to direct our tax regimes and that\r\norganization’s blacklisting of the offshore financial\r\ncentres of small economies is a case in point. So too is\r\nthe severe pressure within the Free Trade Area of the\r\nAmericas for liberalization of financial markets, as is\r\nthe refusal of those culpable to accept responsibility for\r\nmassive environmental degradation and to put real\r\nresources in place to redress that damage.\r\nTrue equity and true reciprocity need an equitable\r\nbalancing of every aspect of multilateral transaction.\r\nBarbados came to the United Nations with clean\r\nhands and a clear conscience. We had no differences\r\nwith our neighbours that were reconcilable only by\r\nwar. We had no designs on our neighbours’ territory\r\nand no ambitions to dictate to others the way in which\r\nthey should, within the parameters of the United\r\nNations Charter, manage their affairs and determine\r\ntheir destinies. We remain a small, peace-loving nation,\r\nguided on our course by the lodestar of democratic\r\nprinciples, parliamentary governance and respect for\r\nthe human rights of our citizens. Our ambition remains\r\nto safeguard and build on what we have so far earned\r\nand to have, in the global scheme of things, more than\r\njust a vote.\r\nWe wish for the United Nations to assume\r\nresponsibility for integrating into the world multilateral\r\nsystem the small States of this planet, which expect\r\nand, indeed, have a right to be an active and effective\r\npart of the processes of global governance. To fail to\r\nact now would deny us a future of prosperity and\r\nfulfilled human potential. We are not expected to\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\ncomplete this task, but neither are we at liberty to\r\nabstain from it.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Tuiloma Neroni Slade, Chairman of the delegation\r\nof Samoa.\r\nMr. Slade (Samoa): By brave experiment five\r\ndecades and more ago, we sought a better world: a\r\nhoped-for new order premised on peace, justice and\r\nwell-being for all.\r\nThat today we are able to meet as a vastly\r\ntransformed, near-universal United Nations bears\r\ntestimony to vision and endeavour. This Summit is an\r\noccasion for rededication to the spirit of that\r\nendeavour.\r\nBut developments of the past half century have\r\nnot yielded full dividends for all nations, nor for all\r\npeoples. The promises of the Charter remain\r\nunfulfilled. All over the world, core values and the\r\nhuman condition are under assault, constantly,\r\nshamefully. Far too many are in torment because of\r\nhunger and disease. We remain a world that needs to be\r\nfar better. This Summit must therefore be a\r\nrecommitment to human values.\r\nIt is also an occasion to renew commitment to the\r\npurposes of the Organization. Samoa does so as a small\r\ncountry and with abiding faith in the principles of the\r\nCharter. The principles are sound. They are as true\r\ntoday as at the inception, and they provide for an\r\nexpanding future. What needs to be established is the\r\npolitical determination for applying the principles.\r\nThe Organization remains uniquely suited to the\r\npursuit of human values and objectives and the\r\ncoordination of global activities. But, of course, it\r\nneeds to change and to adapt.\r\nThe Security Council, in particular, must be able\r\nto respond to the requirements of a fundamentally\r\ndifferent international setting. It needs to be reformed\r\ncomprehensively to meet contemporary demands and\r\nthe conditions of the world today.\r\nThe membership of the Security Council must be\r\nenlarged to reflect the realities of the present time and\r\nto enhance its representative role and effectiveness.\r\nWe believe very deeply in the sustaining power of\r\ninternational law in support of the principles of the\r\nCharter. The United Nations is an essential and\r\ncohesive force in the elaboration of international law\r\nand rules for international cooperation which now\r\nregulate a phenomenal range of human activity.\r\nSamoa gives its fullest endorsement to the most\r\ntimely initiative of the Secretary-General and his call\r\nfor universal participation in the multilateral treaty\r\nframework, especially in connection with those treaties\r\nthat are representative of the key objectives of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe desire of my country for effective\r\ndisarmament and the total elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction is well known. Such weapons\r\nrepresent the great paradox of our time: while nations\r\ndesire peace, and talk of peace, far more of the national\r\nwealth goes towards the development and acquisition\r\nof ever more sophisticated and ever more destructive\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nNuclear weapons, in particular, reach beyond the\r\nparadox to impose a global curse. Their continuing\r\nexistence poses the gravest of threats to international\r\nsecurity and to global human survival. Samoa gives the\r\nfullest support to the Secretary-General’s proposal for\r\nconvening a major international conference to identify\r\nways of eliminating nuclear dangers.\r\nSamoa believes most strongly in the need for and\r\nthe purposes of the International Criminal Court, and\r\nwill continue to play its part in the development of the\r\nCourt. Humanity needs more than ever a fair, effective\r\nand independent instrument of international criminal\r\njustice.\r\nFor the safeguarding of human rights, all nations,\r\nworking together, need to persist with efforts to\r\npromote tolerance and understanding. The fact is that\r\nwe are all of one human family. Our diversity of race\r\nand culture should pose no threat. Rather, it should be\r\nseen as the fountainhead, offering vast potential for\r\nmutual enrichment and fundamental freedoms.\r\nFreedom is the natural beat of every human heart;\r\ndemocracy the measure of its expression. We need to\r\nensure unquestioned acceptance of the dignity and\r\nequality of all and full respect for their human rights.\r\nPoverty must be made a high-priority millennium\r\nchallenge. Too many are at risk. Some are as poor\r\ntoday as they were 20 years ago. This is an appalling\r\nfact, especially at a time when economies and income\r\nlevels are at their highest peaks in many other\r\ncountries.\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.4\r\nPoverty is first and foremost a problem of\r\ndevelopment. In addressing it we need to address the\r\ninterlinking crises of public health, agricultural\r\nproductivity, environmental degradation and\r\ndemographic stresses. It is impossible to develop a\r\nnation without a healthy and trained population.\r\nDisease and malnutrition will compound despair.\r\nThe global environment is under severe stress.\r\nHuman activity is very largely the cause. Serious\r\nnatural disasters have become more the norm than the\r\nexception. The consequences for a small vulnerable\r\ncountry like my own have a direct impact on life-\r\nsupport systems and the well-being of communities and\r\nthe national economy. The effects are destructive, and\r\nthey are lasting.\r\nFor Samoa and other small island States, no\r\nphenomenon is more threatening in its consequences\r\nand risks than climate change.\r\nSmall island States are doing what they can to\r\ncontribute to the international climate change\r\nnegotiations and to efforts to combat this problem and\r\nto design response mechanisms. We played our part in\r\nnegotiating the Kyoto Protocol, which is an important\r\nfirst step, and we are committed to bringing it into\r\neffect as quickly as is possible.\r\nThe sustainable development of small island\r\ndeveloping States was the focus of the twenty-second\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, last year. It is\r\na matter of obvious priority for Samoa and the Alliance\r\nof Small Island States.\r\nThe twenty-second special session produced\r\nspecific and very practical measures for addressing the\r\nspecial needs and vulnerabilities of small island States\r\naimed at enhancing capacities for national self-\r\nassurance and economic self-sufficiency. This\r\nobjective, we believe, has an important and enduring\r\nmessage for other developing countries. We urge the\r\ninternational community to give these matters full and\r\ntimely attention.\r\nWith its legacy and lessons of the old century,\r\nand the infinite promise of the new millennium, Samoa\r\nbelieves very deeply that the future is very much on the\r\nside of the United Nations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.\r\n"
