(Finland) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Mungra \r\n(Suriname), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 14 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n \r\n Note by the Secretary-General transmitting \r\nthe report of the Agency (A/55/284 and Corr.1) \r\n \r\n Draft resolution (A/55/L.25) \r\n \r\n Amendment (A/55/L.26/Rev.1) \r\n \r\n Amendment (A/55/L.27) \r\n \r\n Ms. Chin Powles (New Zealand): My delegation \r\nwishes to thank the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nMr. ElBaradei, for his introduction of the report of the \r\nAgency for 1999. The Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) gave the Director General and \r\nhis team a resounding vote of confidence. The Agency \r\nhas New Zealand’s unqualified support for its \r\nimportant work in carrying out its mandate fully and \r\nprofessionally. New Zealand attaches special \r\nsignificance to two pillars of the Agency’s work. They \r\nare the contribution that it makes to nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament through its safeguards \r\nand verification role, and its activities in promoting a \r\nglobal nuclear safety culture. Although much has been \r\nachieved, there is still much to be done in both areas. \r\n New Zealand was among the first to bring into \r\nforce a protocol additional to our safeguards agreement \r\nwith the Agency. The slow growth in adherence to the \r\nstrengthened safeguards system is a source of \r\ndisappointment. Certainly the number of signatories is \r\ngrowing — around 53 by last count — but with fewer \r\nthan half of the protocols in force, more determined \r\neffort is required if universal adherence, and the \r\nassurance of non-proliferation it would confer, are to \r\nbe achieved. \r\n New Zealand applauds the recent developments \r\non the Korean peninsula, but again we must record our \r\nconcern about the lack of progress on safeguards \r\nimplementation issues in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. We hope that the new climate that \r\nis prevailing in that country will move it to cooperate \r\nfully with the Agency in coming into full compliance \r\nwith its safeguards agreement, which remains binding \r\nand in force. \r\n Since December 1998, the Agency has not been \r\nin a position to implement its mandate in Iraq under the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, and there is thus \r\nno assurance of compliance with those resolutions. The \r\nAgency’s visit to Iraq in January pursuant to Iraq’s \r\nsafeguards agreement was welcome, but it did not \r\nconstitute a substitute. \r\n New Zealand’s concern about the effect of \r\nnuclear-related accidents on humanity and our \r\nenvironment runs deep. We therefore support strongly \r\nthe Agency’s work to strengthen international \r\ncooperation in nuclear radiation and waste safety, and \r\n \r\n2  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nthe assistance it is able to give in the event of an \r\naccident. New Zealand has done everything it can to \r\nminimize the risks of nuclear-related accidents in our \r\nown country and in our region. But we remain \r\nvulnerable to the effects of a nuclear-related accident \r\nbecause of the maritime transport of radioactive \r\nmaterials. \r\n At this year’s General Conference New Zealand, \r\nalong with a group of co-sponsors from a wide range of \r\ngeographic regions, was responsible for a resolution on \r\nthe safety of transport of radioactive materials. That \r\nresolution, while perhaps not as strong as we would all \r\nhave liked, moved the issue forward in a useful and \r\nbalanced way. We were particularly pleased that it was \r\npossible to secure a successful outcome by consensus \r\non a subject to which New Zealanders and others in our \r\nimmediate region attach such importance. \r\n The international community has high \r\nexpectations of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency. It can only continue to fulfil those \r\nexpectations if Member States ensure that the Director \r\nGeneral has the resources and the support to meet the \r\nchallenges the membership establishes for the Agency. \r\nNew Zealand for its part will continue to contribute \r\nconstructively in support of the Agency’s extremely \r\nimportant work. \r\n Mr. Šerkšnys (Lithuania): At the outset, I wish to \r\nthank Director General Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei for his \r\ncomprehensive and excellent report on the work of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We also \r\nwish to express our appreciation for the Agency’s \r\noutstanding performance, and we commend his \r\ndedicated and effective leadership. \r\n Lithuania has aligned itself with the European \r\nUnion statement delivered yesterday in connection \r\nwith this agenda item. Apart from that, I wish to take \r\nthis opportunity to outline a number of specific issues. \r\n The report of the Director General, transmitted in \r\ndocument A/55/284, comprehensively and fairly \r\nreflects the wide range of issues that have been the \r\nfocus of the Agency’s attention over the last year. The \r\naspect of the IAEA’s activities to which Lithuania \r\nattaches special importance is its work in the \r\npromotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\nAgainst the background of growing energy demands \r\nworld-wide, Lithuania concurs with the Director \r\nGeneral that there are various opinions on the future of \r\nnuclear power. Nuclear power can help to meet global \r\nenergy needs in a sustainable and environmentally \r\nconscious manner. Yet, much still needs to be done to \r\nincrease economic competitiveness, advance \r\ntechnologies and, in particular, to improve public \r\nconfidence. \r\n Over a number of years, Lithuania has been \r\namong the leading countries in terms of the share of \r\nnuclear energy in its total energy production. Bilateral \r\nand multilateral assistance provided by donor \r\ncountries, and regional and national technical \r\ncooperation projects of the IAEA, have helped elevate \r\nthe safety level of the Ignalina nuclear power plant to \r\ninternationally recognized safety standards. \r\n Safety improvements notwithstanding, the \r\nparliament of Lithuania earlier this year took the \r\ndecision to shut down one of the two nuclear reactors \r\nby 2005. The estimated cost of decommissioning runs \r\nto more than $1 billion, and the overall cost of \r\ndecommissioning plus the treatment and storage of \r\nradioactive waste and used nuclear fuel could reach \r\n$3.5 billion. Given such an enormous financial burden, \r\ntimely decommissioning could well depend on \r\nconsiderable long-term financial and technical \r\nassistance from the international community. \r\n The first international donor conference, which \r\ntook place in Lithuania in June 2000, marked the \r\nbeginning of a long process. I wish wholeheartedly to \r\nthank Governments of the European Union, the Group \r\nof Seven and other interested States, financial \r\ninstitutions and the IAEA for their pledges and \r\ncommitments with respect to the decommissioning of \r\nthe Ignalina nuclear power plant. It is extremely \r\nimportant that the participation of the international \r\ncommunity in managing the issues of decommissioning \r\nbe long-term and continuous. \r\n In that regard, we wish to underline the \r\nimportance of IAEA activities. Lithuania has benefited \r\ngreatly from technical cooperation programmes in \r\nrecent years. Now, we look forward to having a new \r\nproject approved under the technical cooperation \r\nprogramme, whereby the IAEA would provide long-\r\nterm technical assistance in decommissioning Unit 1. \r\n We attach utmost importance to the safety of the \r\nreactor during the phase-out period. Lithuania has \r\ntaken steps to ensure high standards of safety while \r\ndecommissioning the reactor. The main safety criteria \r\nare set out in the general requirements for the \r\ndecommissioning of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, \r\n \r\n 3 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nwhich were drafted on the basis of documents of the \r\nIAEA and the International Commission on \r\nRadiological Protection, as well as European Union \r\ndirectives. Last year, Lithuania took advantage of \r\nmissions by the International Physical Protection \r\nAdvisory Service and the International Probabilistic \r\nSafety Assessments Review Team, which strengthened \r\nour confidence in our safety measures and criteria. \r\n The vital role that the IAEA has been playing \r\nover many years in promoting international \r\ncooperation to strengthen nuclear safety and the culture \r\nof safety is to be commended. The IAEA has spared no \r\neffort to develop internationally recognized safety \r\nstandards and guidelines and legally binding \r\ninternational conventions with regard to nuclear safety \r\nand radiation protection. In that respect, we wish to \r\nnote the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a \r\nNuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, which \r\nwas recently ratified by Lithuania. \r\n Apart from safety, the serious issue of the \r\nmanagement of radioactive waste and spent fuel will \r\nremain on the agenda for the longer term. Minimizing \r\nthe amount of nuclear waste and improving its \r\nsegregation and treatment are the main objectives of \r\nour review of a national approach to radioactive waste \r\nmanagement. In that task Lithuania is following the \r\nguidelines and principles of the Joint Convention on \r\nthe Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the \r\nSafety of Radioactive Waste Management. We strongly \r\nsupport and encourage the Agency’s work on waste \r\nminimization, especially during decommissioning \r\noperations. \r\n The Agency’s continuing work in the field of \r\nsustainable energy strategies must also be commended. \r\nOver the years the Agency has developed substantial \r\nexpertise. Its data, information and analysis help \r\nnational decision-makers to take well-considered \r\ndecisions on how best to meet the energy needs of their \r\ncountries. The Agency’s role in research and \r\ndevelopment projects on innovative nuclear fuel cycles \r\nand power plants is also to be noted. \r\n The debate on the future of nuclear power should \r\nnot be confined to sustainable development but should \r\nbe extended also to climate change. In that regard, the \r\ndevelopment of small and medium-sized reactors that \r\ncould be competitive in their own right is to be \r\nencouraged so as to keep all options open for the future \r\nexpansion of electricity supply systems in countries \r\nthat lack sufficient alternative energy resources. \r\n The international community’s resolve to advance \r\nthe non-proliferation regime was demonstrated during \r\nthe 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT). The States parties to the NPT clearly \r\nacknowledged that the non-proliferation regime could \r\nhardly be effective without input from the Agency. \r\nLithuania commends and strongly supports the work of \r\nthe Agency in its pursuit of universal signature of \r\nadditional safeguards protocols. Lithuania was one of \r\nthe first States to sign an additional protocol, and we \r\nratified ours this year. \r\n The creation of a strengthened safeguards system \r\nhas yet to restore confidence in the system. We must \r\nensure that the Agency has the financial and human \r\nresources it needs to carry out its responsibilities and \r\nimprove its ability to detect the diversion of fissile \r\nmaterials and other undeclared activities. In this \r\nregard, we commend the Agency’s efforts to strengthen \r\nthe overall safeguards system. The increased use of \r\nshort-notice inspections and the development of \r\nadvanced verification technologies have proved to be \r\nof particular value in this respect. However, IAEA \r\nsafeguards can be effective only so long as all States \r\nhonour their commitments. \r\n The number of States without comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements raises concerns. However, it is \r\neven more worrisome that the IAEA has not been able \r\nso far to carry out its Security-Council-mandated \r\nactivities in Iraq or to provide assurances regarding the \r\ncorrectness and completeness of the initial declaration \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We \r\nhope that the latest positive developments regarding \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will soon \r\nfind their way into the area of safeguards. \r\n Finally, I wish to reiterate that Lithuania looks \r\nforward to continuing its cooperation with the IAEA, \r\nwhich we value so highly. The Agency can count on \r\nLithuania’s constructive support. Lithuania has \r\nsponsored draft resolutions on the report of the IAEA \r\nfor a number of years. We will do our utmost to \r\nsupport the draft resolution introduced by Nigeria; we \r\nstrongly wish to see it adopted by consensus. \r\n Mr. Ivanov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): I wish \r\nat the outset to thank the Director-General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. \r\n \r\n4  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nMohamed ElBaradei, for his introduction of the report \r\nof the Agency. My delegation has carefully studied the \r\nreport, and highly appreciates its excellent quality. \r\n Because of the ever-increasing pace of \r\ntechnological progress, economic globalization and the \r\nspecialization of production, and because of the \r\nincreasing interdependence among States, \r\nGovernments must develop extensive energy \r\ninfrastructures to meet the growing demand for \r\nelectricity. Given the limits of traditional energy \r\nsources, it was necessary to find a new way of safely \r\nproviding affordable energy. That way was the peaceful \r\nuse of nuclear power. But we know from bitter \r\nexperience that even the peaceful atom has caused \r\nterrible tragedies with world-shaking consequences.  \r\n Under those circumstances, the work of the \r\nIAEA, one of the most extraordinary and highly \r\nrespected international organizations, is extremely \r\nimportant. We believe that the IAEA is playing a more \r\nimportant role than ever before in guaranteeing the \r\nnon-proliferation regime, in creating safe systems for \r\ncurrent nuclear installations, and in providing scientific \r\nand technical assistance to its member States. \r\n Belarus has always supported the work of the \r\nIAEA aimed at guaranteeing the non-proliferation \r\nregime and has consistently advocated the \r\nstrengthening of that regime. This is evidenced by the \r\nfact that my country has signed, and is strictly \r\nimplementing the Treaty on the Reduction and \r\nLimitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \r\nSafeguards Agreement. This year, our Republic joined \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the \r\nNuclear Suppliers Group. \r\n Guided by the principles of non-proliferation, \r\nBelarus of course complies with all the commitments \r\nentered into under the Safeguards Agreement. Experts \r\nin my country are now completing the process of \r\nstudying the protocol additional to the Safeguards \r\nAgreement with a view to signing it. In this respect, we \r\nare grateful to the Agency for organizing in Minsk a \r\nspecial seminar on sharing experience on working to \r\nimplement the additional protocol. \r\n Our delegation would like to inform the General \r\nAssembly that Belarus has now carried out a number of \r\nelements on the strengthened safeguards system. \r\nAgency inspectors have annual visas and are able to \r\ngain access so that they can take samples from the \r\nsurfaces of hot chambers. The Government has made a \r\ndecision about a remote monitoring system at the \r\nNational Academy of Sciences of Belarus Scientific \r\nand Technical Centre in Sosny. We are also \r\nparticipating in the open-ended working group to \r\ndiscuss the possibility and advisability of reviewing the \r\n1980 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial. \r\n Should the States Parties adopt an agreed and \r\npositive decision in this regard, Belarus will seek to \r\nensure that due account is given to the interests of \r\ncountries that do not have adequate institutional and \r\nfinancial resources in order to help to improve their \r\nnational protection systems. Our country is also \r\nactively participating in the IAEA programme to \r\ncombat the illicit trafficking in nuclear material and \r\nother radioactive sources. We believe that it is now \r\nurgently necessary to develop a single conceptual \r\napproach to establishing radiation standards. As many \r\nspeakers have noted, introducing such common \r\nstandards, to replace the various standards that now \r\napply, would help countries to combat trafficking in \r\nnuclear materials and also facilitate the trade in and \r\ntransport of goods across borders. \r\n Another important aspect of IAEA work is \r\nensuring maximum security for currently operative \r\nnuclear energy and nuclear technology installations. \r\nOur people paid an enormous price in learning how \r\nimportant it is to ensure the safety of technology. As a \r\nresult of the Chernobyl disaster thousands of adults and \r\nchildren are suffering from a variety of cancers, much \r\nof our fertile land has been taken out of production and \r\nour State has been forced to spend more than it spends \r\non national defence simply to deal with the \r\nconsequences of our disaster. In this context, we are \r\ngrateful to the IAEA for the practical assistance that is \r\nhas provided in the past and that it is still providing \r\nunder the technical cooperation programme. \r\n Belarus supports the IAEA’s proposal for \r\npartnership for development and approves of the \r\ncurrent three-pronged strategy for technical \r\ncooperation based on model projects, national \r\nframework programmes and thematic planning. We are \r\nparticularly impressed by the fact that each IAEA \r\nproject is geared towards actual concrete output. \r\n Having carefully studied the report, we must \r\npoint out that one of the most striking consequences of \r\nradiation accidents is fear of radioactivity on the part \r\n \r\n 5 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nof the public. This can be overcome only by proving \r\nthat nuclear power can be used safely to help people, \r\nboth in theory and in practice. On the theoretical side, \r\nwe must encourage more scientific research on a new \r\ngeneration of nuclear power plants that is much safer, \r\neven in emergency situations, and more efficient. We \r\nhope that the IAEA will accord even more attention in \r\nfuture to developing this area of nuclear science. \r\n We are very concerned about the tendency of \r\nyoung scientists and specialists with nuclear expertise \r\nto leave our countries. We believe that the safe \r\nfunctioning of our nuclear power structures will not be \r\npossible if we do not have highly educated and talented \r\nyoung people working in this area. To some extent this \r\nproblem is due to a certain stagnation in efforts to find \r\nnew applications for nuclear energy and to improve \r\nexisting technology. \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of Belarus would \r\nlike to commend the work of the Agency and support \r\nthe main areas of future activity. We hope that there \r\nwill be close cooperation with the Agency in resolving \r\nall problems relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\npower. \r\n Mr. Ahmad (Pakistan): First of all, I should like, \r\non behalf of my delegation, to extend our \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), for his leadership and for the effective manner \r\nin which he is steering the work of the IAEA. \r\n Pakistan remains firmly committed to the goals \r\nand objectives of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency. As a founding member of the IAEA, we are \r\nglad to note that the it remains among the most \r\nefficiently run organizations in the entire United \r\nNations system. The tasks assigned to it are \r\nscientifically challenging, technically complex, \r\npolitically sensitive and financially demanding. The \r\nIAEA’s statutory objective that the Agency shall seek \r\nto accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic \r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the \r\nworld, gives it a unique and multifaceted role in the \r\nprocess of economic development. \r\n We acknowledge with appreciation the IAEA’s \r\nrole in helping Pakistan to benefit from the peaceful \r\nuse of the atom in fields ranging from nuclear power \r\nproduction to agriculture. Through its technical \r\nassistance, the IAEA has contributed to our efforts at \r\nestablishing a base of professional manpower, research \r\ninstitutes, training facilities, medical centres and other \r\ntechnical services in the field of the peaceful uses of \r\nthe atom. \r\n For its part, Pakistan has provided training \r\nopportunities to many IAEA nominees. Our experience \r\nwith the peaceful uses of technology is being shared \r\nwith other developing countries only under IAEA \r\nauspices. We believe that such interactions among the \r\ndeveloping countries will further strengthen the spirit \r\nof technical cooperation among developing countries. \r\n Pakistan’s impeccable record in terms of nuclear \r\nsafety and safeguards, its participation in the Agency’s \r\npromotional activities and its active and constructive \r\nrole in the IAEA’s policy-making organs reflect our \r\nabiding commitment to the promotion of the peaceful \r\nuses of atomic energy. \r\n The promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy is the raison d’être of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency. The world is steadily requiring more \r\nenergy. Energy multiplies human labour, increasing \r\nproductivity. World population surpassed the 6 billion \r\nmark last year. Yet one third of that number — 2 billion \r\npeople — lack access to electricity. Development \r\ndepends on energy, and the alternative to development \r\nis poverty and suffering. \r\n The energy demand cannot be met by fossil fuel \r\nalone, as this would place an unacceptable burden on \r\nthe environment. The massive development of \r\nhydropower is one option. The only other proven and \r\nsustainable option is the use of nuclear energy. We feel \r\nthat opposition to nuclear power, despite its good \r\nsafety record and environmentally friendly character, is \r\neither based on misunderstanding or is a deliberate \r\npretext to deny this technology to developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Pakistan, in view of the limitations of its fossil \r\nfuel and hydropower resources, is keen to make \r\nincreasingly large use of nuclear power to meet its \r\nfuture electricity requirements. \r\n Moreover, as a large part of current power-\r\ngeneration requirements are being met through the use \r\nof oil, huge oil-import bills are incurred. In order to \r\ndiversify the country’s power-generation system and \r\nreduce its dependence on energy imports, increasing \r\nthe use of nuclear power is a desirable option for \r\nPakistan. In this context, we duly acknowledge the \r\ncooperation extended by the IAEA in the construction \r\n \r\n6  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nphase of our second nuclear plant at Chashma, which is \r\nunder IAEA full safeguards. \r\n A high-profile “safety culture” is an \r\nindispensable component of any successful nuclear \r\npower programme. The lessons of Chernobyl must not \r\nbe forgotten in the context of the safe development of \r\nnuclear energy. We are pleased that the IAEA has \r\nplayed a very important role in providing information \r\nand advice to all its members on safety-related issues. \r\nPakistan has ratified the Convention on Nuclear Safety, \r\nas we believe that this Convention has an important \r\nrole in improving the safety culture of States parties. \r\nWe call upon all countries with nuclear power \r\nprogrammes that have not already done so to accede to, \r\nand ratify, the Convention immediately and thus \r\nenhance nuclear safety worldwide. \r\n The implementation of nuclear safeguards \r\nagreements constitutes an important facet of the \r\nIAEA’s activities. We are satisfied at the fact that \r\nduring 1999, the IAEA’s vast safeguards-related \r\nactivities, extending to 900 facilities in some 70 \r\ncountries and involving more than 10,000 person/days \r\nof inspection, show that the nuclear material and other \r\nitems declared and placed under Agency safeguards \r\nwere used in peaceful nuclear activities and were \r\nadequately accounted for. For its part, Pakistan has \r\nfaithfully discharged its safeguards obligations under \r\nits agreements of the INFCIRC/66 category with the \r\nAgency. \r\n Seen in the context of the IAEA’s statutory \r\nobligations and the aspirations of a vast majority of its \r\nmembership, technical cooperation and the transfer of \r\ntechnology remain at the heart of the IAEA’s \r\npromotional role. We are not satisfied that, as \r\ncompared to the projected $73 million, the voluntary \r\nTechnical Cooperation Fund has received only $64 \r\nmillion. While lauding the Agency’s positive role in \r\ntechnical cooperation, we urge that this aspect of the \r\nIAEA’s work be further strengthened. \r\n It is important, for the credibility of the IAEA and \r\nfor ensuring widespread benefits from the peaceful \r\nuses of the atom, that the IAEA maintain its focus on \r\nits technical promotional character. As such, we are \r\nconcerned to note that there has been a visible shift in \r\nemphasis towards the verification role of IAEA. This \r\ntrend needs to be countered and corrected and the \r\nbalance restored. Of course, safeguards constitute a \r\nbasic function of the Agency. But safeguards provide \r\nonly a legal framework for pursuing the primary \r\nobjective of the IAEA, namely the promotion of \r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy. \r\n We expect the Agency to adopt non-\r\ndiscriminatory measures in providing access to nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes. The Agency’s primary \r\npurpose is to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\npower under technically safe conditions, not to serve as \r\na nuclear policeman. \r\n Pakistan remains committed to the goals of non-\r\nproliferation and nuclear disarmament. Pakistan has \r\nhistorically supported all proposals and agreements \r\naimed at the limitation, progressive reduction and \r\neventual elimination of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nFor over a quarter-century, we made efforts and \r\ninitiated proposals to keep South Asia free of nuclear \r\nweapons. Those efforts collapsed in the face of the \r\nIndian nuclear tests conducted in May 1998. \r\n It is a well-known fact that the Indian nuclear-\r\nweapon programme developed and matured on the \r\nbasis of the illicit acquisition of sensitive technology \r\nand a not-so-secret rechannelling of India’s nuclear \r\npower programme, in blatant disregard of its \r\ninternational commitments and obligations. For many \r\nyears, it professed to have a peaceful nuclear \r\nprogramme. Subsequent developments, however, \r\nclearly exposed the wide gap that has always existed \r\nbetween its words and deeds. \r\n The enormity of the resultant threat to our \r\nsecurity forced us to conduct our own nuclear tests to \r\nrestore a strategic balance and maintain peace in the \r\nregion. Restraint and responsibility remain the guiding \r\nprinciples of our nuclear policy. We have announced a \r\nunilateral moratorium on further testing and emphasize \r\nthe need to prevent a nuclear arms race. \r\n We have also proposed to India the establishment \r\nof a strategic restraint regime in South Asia. During the \r\npast year, we have further strengthened our already \r\nstringent domestic regulations against the export of \r\nnuclear equipment or materials. \r\n Mr. Granovsky (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation would like to \r\nwelcome the Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Mohamed \r\nElBaradei, and thanks him for introducing the \r\nAgency’s latest report to us. \r\n \r\n 7 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\n In our view, the IAEA report provides an \r\nobjective picture of the multifaceted work of the \r\nAgency, covering such key areas as ensuring the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons through its \r\nmonitoring functions and promoting the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy for development. The Russian \r\nFederation believes it important to work with the IAEA \r\nto develop the peaceful use of nuclear energy. One \r\nnoteworthy example of this was the signing in March \r\nthis year of the protocol additional to the safeguards \r\nagreement between Russia and the IAEA. We are ready \r\nto continue doing our utmost to strengthen the \r\nAgency’s policy-making and scientific potential. \r\n The Agency report is being issued after the \r\nsuccessful completion of the Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). Russia, as one of the \r\ndepositories for the NPT, is pleased that the documents \r\nadopted at the Review Conference set forth a detailed \r\nagenda for furthering nuclear disarmament. We believe \r\nthat the Conference’s success derived from achieving a \r\ncarefully calibrated balance of interests in the final \r\ndocument. Now, if we want that document to be \r\neffective, we have to preserve that balance without \r\nupsetting it for the benefit of this or that national \r\nposition. \r\n It is also important to realistically assess the \r\nsituation. Further reductions of strategic offensive \r\nweapons can be achieved only in close concurrence \r\nwith the preservation and strengthening of the Anti-\r\nBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. Preservation of the \r\n1972 ABM Treaty, which is the keystone of global \r\nstrategic stability, opens the possibility of concluding a \r\nSTART III agreement that provides for lower levels of \r\nwarheads for each of the parties — 15,000 each. \r\n NPT Conference decisions certainly enhance the \r\nrole and the status of the IAEA as a universal organ for \r\ncooperation among States in the nuclear field. In our \r\nview, the main tasks facing the Agency in the twenty-\r\nfirst century are, on the one hand, facilitating \r\ninternational cooperation to provide for economically \r\nsound and environmentally safe uses of weapons-grade \r\nmaterials in civilian nuclear fuel cycles and, on the \r\nother hand, helping to develop new nuclear \r\ntechnologies that cannot be used for weapons purposes. \r\n The Agency is already working hard on \r\nmonitoring the use of fissionable materials generated \r\nby weapons programmes. We place great stock in the \r\njoint work being carried out by the experts of Russia, \r\nthe United States and the IAEA, under the framework \r\nof the 1996 trilateral agreement, as regards applying \r\nAgency monitoring to fissile materials from weapons \r\nsources. The work is proceeding in accordance with the \r\nschedule approved by the three parties. \r\n As for establishing innovative technologies that \r\nwould be safe in terms of nuclear weapon proliferation, \r\nmuch remains to be done in this area. At the \r\nMillennium Summit, our President, Mr. Vladimir \r\nPutin, proposed a means of ensuring the energy needed \r\nfor sustainable development, both fundamentally \r\nresolving the problem of nuclear-weapons proliferation \r\nand improving the health of the global environment. \r\nThe Russian proposal is aimed at gradually excluding \r\nthe basic weapons-grade materials — enriched uranium \r\nand pure plutonium — from being used in the \r\nproduction of peaceful nuclear energy. We have done \r\nresearch in our country that shows there is a real \r\npossibility of producing nuclear energy without these \r\nweapons-grade materials. Moreover there appears to be \r\na possibility of burning plutonium and other elements \r\nso as to ensure that these wastes can be returned to the \r\nEarth’s crust without disrupting the natural \r\nradioactivity of the Earth. This would put an end to the \r\nnegative impact of nuclear energy on the environment \r\nand solve definitively the problem of radioactive \r\nwastes. \r\n We are pleased that in September 2000, at the \r\nIAEA General Conference, the Director General \r\nsupported the Russian proposal. Work has now begun \r\non its practical implementation. In this regard the \r\nIAEA has decided to establish an ad hoc group on \r\ninnovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles. The first \r\nmeeting of this group will be held at the end of \r\nNovember 6, 2000. \r\n I would like to stress that the Russian proposal \r\ndoes not mean the immediate renunciation of the \r\ncurrent nuclear fuel cycle and the shutting down of all \r\noperating nuclear power plants. What we envisage is \r\nbroad international cooperation so that together we can \r\ndevelop future-oriented innovative reactor technology. \r\n We are pleased that the draft resolution on the \r\nIAEA report invites interested Member States to work \r\ntogether under the aegis of the Agency to consider \r\nthese matters. We also support IAEA efforts to prevent \r\ntrafficking in nuclear materials, so as to raise the level \r\nof physical protection and develop national accounting \r\n \r\n8  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nand monitoring systems for nuclear materials. We \r\nsupport broadening cooperation among States so as to \r\nstop nuclear smuggling. \r\n The Agency’s work to provide technical \r\ncooperation to developing countries so that they can \r\nimplement priority programmes relating to the peaceful \r\nuse of nuclear energy is vitally important to Russia. We \r\nactively participate in the Agency’s technical \r\ncooperation programmes by providing equipment and \r\norganizing and conducting training courses and \r\nseminars for specialists from developing countries. \r\n At the same time, we think it important that the \r\nAgency support countries with economies in transition, \r\nabove all with eliminating the consequences of \r\ntechnological disasters. We support continuing \r\ninternational community assistance to countries that \r\nare suffering from the after-effects of the Chernobyl \r\naccident. We welcome the decision by the President of \r\nUkraine to finally close this nuclear power plant. \r\n We note the positive political changes occurring \r\nin the Korean peninsula. Despite efforts to ignore these \r\nchanges at the IAEA General Conference, a resolution \r\nwas adopted regarding these changes. We hope that \r\npositive shifts in this region will help to ensure full \r\nimplementation of the safeguards agreement between \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nAgency. \r\n In conclusion, let me join others in expressing \r\napproval of the IAEA annual report and in expressing \r\nthe hope that a consensus draft resolution containing \r\nthe results of this review will be prepared. \r\n Mr. Salazar (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation wishes to express its satisfaction with the \r\ncomprehensive report by the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. \r\nMohamed ElBaradei, which confirms once again the \r\nefficient performance of the Organization and the \r\nDirector General’s successful leadership of a group of \r\nable professionals, committed to the cause of nuclear \r\nsafety and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. \r\n Peru, which is in one of the first nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones, places great importance on the role of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in the realization \r\nof the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), confirmed at the last \r\nConference of the parties to this important \r\ninternational instrument promoting total nuclear \r\ndisarmament. The IAEA also has an important role in \r\nthe application of the guarantees and safeguards to \r\nwhich States possessing nuclear energy must commit \r\nthemselves, since nuclear energy has a dual character, \r\nthreatening but at the same time with ever greater \r\napplications for the social development of peoples. \r\n Nevertheless, I would like to refer to the third \r\npillar in the Agency’s work: technical cooperation with \r\ndeveloping countries to give them the many \r\npossibilities offered by the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy, with its social impact. \r\n With respect to my country and subregion, I wish \r\nto refer to IAEA’s support for the development plan for \r\nthe Peru-Ecuador border area for the period 2001-2002, \r\nwith the approval of two projects, one in the area of \r\nnuclear medicine, which is to receive significant \r\nfunding, and the other on the application of isotopic \r\ntechniques in hydrology. The latter has been approved \r\nas a regional project, in which Chile, Costa Rica, \r\nColombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Uruguay also \r\nparticipate. The Agency has allotted $2 million to this \r\nproject.  \r\n The official visit of the Director General of the \r\nAgency to Peru in October 1999 strengthened the \r\nrelationship between the Agency and my country, \r\nwhich was confirmed at the highest level. That visit \r\nenabled us to inform the Agency about the various \r\nactivities for the peaceful use of nuclear energy carried \r\nout in my country. Furthermore, the signing of the \r\nMemorandum of Understanding on technical \r\ncooperation with the IAEA on 18 October made it \r\npossible to make our country a sort of regional \r\ntechnical cooperation centre, using the Instituto \r\nPeruano de Energia Nuclear (IPEN) as a regional \r\nsubcontractor, in recognition of the Institute’s work as \r\na nuclear research centre, as well as a producer of \r\ntechnological services. The signing of the \r\nMemorandum of Understanding is timely, in the \r\ncontext of a regional workshop on technical \r\ncooperation programmes for the region for the period \r\n2001-2002, as well as the preparatory work for \r\ndrawing up programmes for the next biennium. \r\n Lastly, I would like to draw attention to the \r\nsupport given by the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency in offering my country a regional seminar to \r\npromote the Additional Protocol, to be held in Lima in \r\n2001, which will also enjoy the support of the United \r\nNations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and \r\n \r\n 9 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nDevelopment in Latin America and the Caribbean, as \r\nwell as the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean \r\n(OPANAL), which has its headquarters in Mexico. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n I should like to inform Members that action on \r\ndraft resolution A/55/L.25 and the amendments thereto \r\nwill be taken on Friday, 10 November 2000, as the last \r\nitem on the agenda. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 27 \r\n \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of African Unity \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/55/498) \r\n \r\n The President: The first speaker is the \r\nrepresentative of Togo, who will make a statement on \r\nbehalf of the Organization of African Unity. \r\n Mr. Kpotsra (Togo) (spoke in French): In his \r\naddress to the General Assembly at this session, \r\nPresident Eyadéma, current Chairman of the \r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), placed \r\nparticular stress on, among other things, the need for \r\nthe international community to resolutely support the \r\ntireless efforts made by African countries to find \r\nlasting solutions to the enormous problems that they \r\nstill face several decades after attaining sovereignty. \r\n The particularly difficult situation in which \r\nAfrican States find themselves is marked by a notable \r\nlack of stability, decaying national economies and a \r\ncontinually worsening health situation. This situation, \r\nexacerbated by the perverse effects of globalization, in \r\nAfrica should naturally lead the international \r\ncommunity to enhance its cooperation with African \r\ncountries. \r\n In this context, the United Nations clearly \r\nremains the most appropriate framework for action. \r\nThrough its bodies, its funds, its programmes and \r\nspecialized agencies, the United Nations plays a \r\nleading role in the preservation of peace and \r\npeacekeeping, as well as in promoting development in \r\nAfrica. The conditions in Africa today require that the \r\nworld Organization be a catalyst for the assistance \r\nneeded by African countries, by strengthening its \r\ncooperation with the OAU, the subregional \r\norganizations, African Governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs). That is why, \r\nbefore going further, I would like to warmly \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his report on \r\ncooperation between the OAU and the United Nations \r\nsystem in the past year. \r\n Governed by the Agreement of 15 November \r\n1965, updated on 9 October 1990, cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the OAU has in recent years \r\ngrown steadily. It covers such varied areas as conflict \r\nprevention, peacekeeping, electoral assistance, \r\nhumanitarian aid and emergency relief, post-conflict \r\nreconstruction, the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights, access to information and communication \r\ntechnology, economic and social development, as well \r\nas managing refugee problems and demographic issues. \r\n As is the case every year, the debate offers an \r\nopportunity to review what has been done in the \r\ndifferent fields covered by this partnership in the \r\nprevious year, and especially to identify possibilities to \r\nfurther deepen and strengthen the partnership. \r\n With respect to peacekeeping and security, on \r\nwhich the United Nations undeniably has considerable \r\nexperience, which it could use to help strengthen the \r\ncapacity of the OAU and subregional organizations, we \r\nare pleased to note that the two organizations have \r\ncontinued to combine their efforts to settle and prevent \r\nconflicts in Africa. \r\n Thus, under the tireless leadership of President \r\nAbdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, the OAU’s mediation \r\nefforts in the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea \r\nmade it possible to conclude, on 18 June 2000, the \r\nAgreement on Cessation of Hostilities and the \r\nestablishment and deployment by the Security Council \r\nof the United Nations Mission in Eritrea and Ethiopia \r\nunder the terms of resolutions 1312 (2000) and 1320 \r\n(2000), which have been steadfastly supported by the \r\nUnited Nations. The final phase of the Mission, in \r\nwhich almost 4,200 troops will be deployed in both \r\ncountries, will be launched shortly, according to the \r\nlatest information. We hope that this momentum \r\ntowards peace will continue and that a definitive \r\nsettlement to this border dispute between the two \r\ncountries will be found. \r\n In Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, initiatives are under way involving both \r\norganizations. \r\n \r\n10  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\n Another important element of United Nations \r\nmonitoring of African conflicts is the fact that the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, in close \r\ncooperation with the OAU Secretary-General, has \r\nappointed personal representatives or special envoys, \r\ninter alia, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nEthiopia/Eritrea. This cooperation can also be seen in \r\nthe United Nations support for African subregional \r\norganizations. \r\n In this respect, I am pleased to note the \r\nestablishment of such frameworks of cooperation as \r\nthe coordination mechanism between the United \r\nNations, the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS) and the Government of Sierra \r\nLeone. The first meeting of this mechanism, held here \r\nin New York on 11 September, allowed us to assess the \r\npeace process in Sierra Leone and to identify urgent \r\nmeasures to be taken in order to implement \r\nharmoniously the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil and the Lomé Peace Agreement. \r\n In spite of everything, the prevention of conflicts \r\nremains, in our opinion, the focal point for cooperation \r\nbetween the OAU and the United Nations. Indeed, it \r\nhas been determined that the parties to a dispute tend to \r\nbe less entrenched in the early stages and to be far \r\nmore inclined to seek negotiated solutions than they \r\nare after violence erupts. Loss costly from a human and \r\nfinancial point of view, prevention also offers the \r\ngreatest possibilities of addressing the root causes of a \r\ndispute, thus providing a genuine opportunity to lay the \r\nbasis of a lasting peace. \r\n It is in this regard that, at the thirty-fifth OAU \r\nSummit in Algiers, the African heads of States and \r\nGovernment, having proclaimed the year 2000 as a \r\nyear of peace, stability and development in Africa, are \r\nstriving to join forces to prevent the emergence of new \r\ninternal and inter-State conflicts and the political and \r\nsocial upheavals that are likely to lead to serious \r\ndisturbances. The steps undertaken a few weeks ago on \r\nbehalf of the pan-African organization by some 10 \r\nheads of State are part of this process and should be \r\nreinforced elsewhere and whenever necessary. \r\n Our catchphrase should be “focus on preventive \r\nmeasures”. In this respect, it is encouraging to note, as \r\nindicated in the Secretary-General’s report, that the \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs is working to that end \r\nwith the OAU Secretary-General and that the \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations has posted a \r\nmilitary liaison officer to the OAU office in Addis \r\nAbaba in order to enhance information-sharing and \r\ncoordination. \r\n Similarly, we are pleased by the partnership \r\nestablished between the United Nations and the OAU \r\nthrough the United Nations Development Programme \r\nto strengthen OAU capacities in the prevention, \r\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts and through \r\nthe Trust Fund created to that end. \r\n Africa’s resolve to take control of its own affairs \r\nand the different lines of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the OAU should not make us lose \r\nsight of the fact that the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security lies \r\nwith the Security Council. In this regard, the United \r\nNations must firmly support the initiatives of African \r\nStates to strengthen African capacity in peacekeeping \r\nand conflict settlement. \r\n It is extremely distressing, however, to note that \r\nthe international community has not always granted the \r\nkind of appropriate attention to the management of \r\nconflicts in Africa that it has always accorded to other \r\nregions of the world. Moreover, the efforts made by \r\nAfricans themselves — I refer in particular to those \r\nundertaken pursuant to Chapter VIII of the United \r\nNations Charter, such as the involvement of the \r\nECOWAS Monitoring Group in Guinea-Bissau and \r\nSierra Leone — are not given adequate financial and \r\nlogistical support. \r\n On the basis of this, the thirty-sixth OAU \r\nSummit, through the Lomé Declaration, invited the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community to \r\naccord the necessary attention to the management and \r\nsettlement of conflicts in Africa and actively to support \r\ninitiatives taken under Chapter VII of the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\n We hope that a thorough review of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Panel \r\non United Nations Peace Operations, led by \r\nAmbassador Brahimi, will allow the international \r\ncommunity to find appropriate solutions to the problem \r\nof peace and security that remains the central concern \r\nof African countries. \r\n The management of emergency humanitarian \r\nsituations in Africa is another important area of \r\ninteraction between the United Nations and the OAU. \r\nEmerging as a result of crises and conflicts between \r\n \r\n 11 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nand within States, the issue of refugees and displaced \r\npersons has grown in importance, while the resources \r\nallocated to the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have been \r\ncontinuously on the decline. \r\n In this regard, I cannot fail to welcome the \r\nextensive cooperation between the OAU and UNHCR, \r\nwhich led to a special OAU/UNHCR meeting of \r\ngovernment and non-government technical experts in \r\nConakry from 7 to 9 March on the occasion of the \r\nthirtieth anniversary of the OAU Convention \r\nGoverning the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems \r\nin Africa. The plan of action adopted at that meeting \r\nand later by the OAU Council of Ministers seeks to \r\nremedy the critical situation of refugees in Africa. \r\n Moreover, natural disasters in Africa in recent \r\nyears — flooding in Mozambique, the cyclone in \r\nMadagascar and drought in Ethiopia — have \r\nhighlighted the need for Africa to coordinate its efforts \r\nto strengthen, with United Nations assistance, its \r\ncapacities to respond more swiftly and effectively to \r\nemergencies and natural disasters. \r\n In this regard, we would note that, in the 2000-\r\n2002 biennial action programme, drafted by the United \r\nNations and the OAU at the conclusion of the meeting \r\non cooperation held by their respective secretariats in \r\nAddis Ababa on 10 and 11 April, the two organizations \r\nagreed on concrete measures to strengthen cooperation \r\nbetween the OAU and the departments and competent \r\nbodies of the United Nations system, in particular the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \r\n The United Nations Children’s Fund, through its \r\nactions in countries affected by war, such as Burundi, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra \r\nLeone, has focused particular attention on meeting the \r\nneeds of children in the framework of humanitarian \r\nassistance. Similarly, in cooperation with the World \r\nBank and the United Nations Educational, Scientific \r\nand Cultural Organization, the World Food Programme \r\nhas sought over the past year to assist African countries \r\nthat have adopted national plans to improve primary \r\nschool attendance. \r\n While conflict prevention, humanitarian \r\nassistance and development efforts all go hand in hand, \r\nwe must also address the root causes of conflicts, not \r\nmerely their symptoms. In other words, the effective \r\nmanagement of conflicts must include efforts to \r\npromote sustainable development, eradicate poverty, \r\nease the unbearable debt burden of the poor countries \r\nand encourage and follow-up measures for democratic \r\nand economic reform. \r\n In the area of democratic reforms, the \r\ncooperation provided by the United Nations is a useful \r\nsupport to the efforts made in this area by African \r\nStates, be it in the area of elections, good governance \r\nor respect for human rights. The electoral assistance \r\nprovided by the United Nations through its Department \r\nof Political Affairs is part of the efforts undertaken by \r\nAfrican countries themselves in setting up stable and \r\nrepresentative Governments — an essential factor for \r\nthe prevention of conflicts.  \r\n From an economic point of view, there is no need \r\nto point out that the quest for adequate and lasting \r\nsolutions to the problems of growth and economic \r\ndevelopment are concerns of African States. In this \r\nrespect, the OAU and African countries have, in recent \r\nyears, endeavoured to begin drastic economic reforms \r\nand programmes on a continental scale: the Lagos Plan \r\nof Action is still relevant 19 years later, as well as the \r\nAfrican Economic Community — launched in 1991; \r\nthe Cairo Programme of Action of 1995 — devoted to \r\nenhancing economic and social development in Africa; \r\nand finally the African Union — a project that was \r\nlaunched at the special summit in Surt in September \r\n1999 and was adopted at the last OAU Summit in \r\nLomé. The expertise of the Economic Commission for \r\nAfrica of the United Nations is particularly beneficial \r\nfor the Secretary-General of the OAU in his efforts to \r\ndraw up various strategies for integration within the \r\ncontinent.  \r\n The implementation of these different integration \r\nmeasures can certainly be enhanced through \r\ncooperation among African States, the World Bank and \r\nthe International Monetary Fund — the latter two \r\nproviding the assistance to the African States that \r\nwould allow them to strengthen their capacity for \r\nmacroeconomic management.  \r\n Likewise, cooperation among the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development, the OAU and \r\nAfrican States would allow Africa to implement the \r\nprogrammes mentioned above insofar as they would \r\nhelp African countries in multilateral trade negotiations \r\nand would allow them to further benefit from \r\nadvantages offered by globalization and to be able to \r\ndeal with the risks it brings. \r\n \r\n12  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\n The objectives pursued by the United Nations \r\nthrough its deep and multi-faceted partnership with the \r\nOAU and African countries include the effort to \r\neradicate poverty in Africa. If, in spite of commitments \r\nmade and efforts undertaken, the awaited results are \r\nlate in coming, it is because of the diversity and scope \r\nof the problems.  \r\n As we are aware, the financial situation of the \r\ncontinent is characterized by an enormous external \r\ndebt, stagnant national savings, as well as declining \r\nofficial development assistance and weak private \r\ncapital flows.  \r\n During the review of agenda item 50, entitled \r\n“Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa,” many \r\ndelegations highlighted the impact of these different \r\nfactors on prospects for development in Africa.  \r\n Of course the critical situation of financing for \r\ndevelopment in Africa will not improve overnight \r\nwithout a new political will and a renewed \r\ncommitment on the part of the international \r\ncommunity. In this regard, the United Nations plays a \r\nleading role in mobilizing the adequate resources that \r\nAfrica requires. It must also play a more active role in \r\nthe crusade carried out by African countries to cancel \r\ntheir external debt. \r\n Likewise, since information and communication \r\ntechnologies can help to promote economic and social \r\ndevelopment and to alleviate poverty, the United \r\nNations must firmly support African States in this area \r\nas well.  \r\n The high-level debate organized by the Economic \r\nand Social Council during its substantive session of the \r\nyear 2000 on the theme of “Development and \r\ninternational cooperation in the twenty-first century: \r\nthe role of information technology in the context of a \r\nknowledge-based global economy” made it possible to \r\ntake stock of the importance of this matter vis-à-vis \r\nAfrican countries and of the digital divide that \r\nseparates Africa from the other regions of the world.  \r\n It is therefore desirable that initiatives designed \r\nto assist Africa, such as the first African Development \r\nForum — organized in Addis Ababa in October 1999 \r\nunder the aegis of the Economic Commission for \r\nAfrica — should be often repeated. This Forum made it \r\npossible for the participants to adopt a certain number \r\nof programmes, including NGO-NET — an action \r\ngroup that aims to include civil society in promoting \r\ninformation and communication technologies in the \r\nservice of development in Africa. \r\n Health is also a very important area of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU. \r\nIn this regard, actions carried out by the United \r\nNations system to control HIV/AIDS on the one hand \r\nand to fight malaria on the other are to be welcomed.  \r\n Last week, the General Assembly adopted \r\nwithout a vote — certainly in a spirit of solidarity with \r\nthe people of Africa — resolution 55/13, in which it \r\n “decides to convene, as a matter of urgency, a \r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, from 25 \r\nto 27 June 2001, to review and address the \r\nproblem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects.” \r\n(resolution 55/13, para. 1) \r\n Africa expects a great deal from this meeting, in \r\nthe preparation of which the Director of the Joint \r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS should play \r\na leading role. In this regard, it warrants the support \r\nand the constant encouragement of the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n We must also welcome the efforts made by the \r\nWorld Health Organization in the area of protection \r\nand improvement of health for all, in particular the \r\npoorest and the most vulnerable. The campaigns, “Roll \r\nBack Malaria” in Africa, the programme to reduce \r\nmaternal mortality through better access to appropriate \r\ncare in developing countries and the Global Alliance \r\nfor Vaccines and Immunization are all telling examples \r\nof these efforts that greatly benefit Africa. \r\n To conclude, I would like to point out that despite \r\nthe continuing enhancement of cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the OAU, many challenges \r\nremain. In order to overcome these challenges, we need \r\ntime, resources and comprehensive initiatives that are \r\nappropriate and bold on the part of the OAU and the \r\nUnited Nations, its funds, programmes and specialized \r\nagencies, as well as the international community as a \r\nwhole.  \r\n Africa, as was mentioned on 12 September 2000 \r\nby the current Chairman of the OAU, must face all \r\nkinds of difficulties, but it remains a region that is \r\npotentially wealthy and as a result must be assisted and \r\nsupported in order to fulfil its immense potential. \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the OAU \r\nwill help to achieve this objective. \r\n \r\n 13 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\n Mr. Levitte (France) (spoke in French): I am \r\npleased to take the floor on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe \r\nassociated with the European Union – Bulgaria, the \r\nCzech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, \r\nPoland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia – and the \r\nassociated countries of Cyprus, Malta and Turkey align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n First of all the European Union would like to \r\nexpress its appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe report he submitted to the Assembly under this \r\nagenda item. Although much remains to be done, the \r\nreport shows the extent to which the two organizations \r\nhave been able to develop close ties in order to work \r\ntogether in various fields. \r\n The European Union especially welcomes the \r\nongoing cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) to enhance \r\ntheir mutual capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts \r\nin Africa. While it feels it vital to continue holding \r\nregular meetings between the two Secretaries-General \r\nand their senior advisers, the European Union \r\nnevertheless feels that the current Chairman and \r\nmembers of the OAU General Secretariat could appear \r\nmore often before the Security Council to provide \r\ninformation on their management of various African \r\ncrises. \r\n Today’s debate on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the OAU is taking place at what is \r\nstill a critical time for the African continent. On the \r\none hand, we can see some signs of political and socio-\r\neconomic progress. On the other hand, more than a \r\nthird of African countries are, or have recently been, \r\ninvolved in armed conflict. The European Union is \r\ndeeply concerned over the increase in the number of \r\narmed conflicts, the constant influx of arms and \r\nmilitary equipment and the growing role of \r\nuncontrolled rebel groups in armed conflicts. \r\n While recalling that, under the Charter, the \r\nSecurity Council has the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the \r\nEuropean Union welcomes the commitment by African \r\ncountries and regional organizations to play a leading \r\nrole in conflict prevention and resolution in Africa. The \r\nEuropean Union commends the efforts by African \r\nleaders and States, as well as by regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, and in particular the \r\nOrganization of African Unity, to resolve conflicts by \r\npeaceful means. \r\n As we said last year, the European Union has a \r\nconsultative mechanism with the OAU, which we wish \r\nto develop further. In particular, we are willing to \r\nstrengthen dialogue with the OAU and subregional \r\norganizations on concrete ways of backing their efforts, \r\ninter alia, in preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping, \r\nheightening awareness of the importance of respect for \r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law, and \r\npromoting the rule of law and a pluralist society. The \r\nEuropean Union has adopted a common position on \r\nhuman rights, democratic principles, the rule of law \r\nand good governance in Africa. It gives high priority to \r\na positive and constructive approach, with a view to \r\nsupporting efforts by the OAU, subregional groups and \r\nAfrican countries to promote respect for human rights \r\nand good governance. \r\n In this context, the European Union welcomes the \r\nsuccess of the Africa-Europe Summit which was held \r\nin Cairo this year under the aegis of the European \r\nUnion and the OAU. In many respects, the Cairo \r\nDeclaration and the Cairo Plan of Action serve as \r\nreference documents and instruments for cooperation \r\non security, social welfare and health, particularly in \r\nrespect of the fight against HIV/AIDS. The \r\ncommitments made by the African countries \r\nthemselves concerning the social sector, the \r\nenvironment, good governance and human rights must \r\nbe actively supported by the international community. \r\n Before going into detail about various \r\nsubregional situations, I would like to pinpoint three \r\nareas in which we feel all the bodies concerned, \r\nparticularly the United Nations and the OAU, should \r\ncooperate more closely. \r\n The first is the fight against trafficking in small \r\narms and light weapons. The initiative taken by the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS) to impose a moratorium on the import and \r\nmanufacture of small arms should be actively \r\nsupported and most certainly extended to other regions \r\nof Africa. \r\n Secondly, with regard to the establishment of an \r\nintegrated and coordinated mechanism to counter \r\ntrafficking in raw materials and arms, the European \r\nUnion welcomes the Security Council’s efforts to \r\nimprove its understanding of the economic origins and \r\ncommercial aspects of certain African conflicts. It \r\n \r\n14  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nnotes with satisfaction the establishment for Angola of \r\na mechanism to monitor sanctions against UNITA; the \r\nsetting up of a panel to investigate the illegal \r\nexploitation of resources in the Democratic Republic of \r\nCongo; and the creation of a panel to investigate illegal \r\ntrade in diamonds and arms in Sierra Leone. It is also \r\npossible to envisage having a single expert body, under \r\nthe aegis of the United Nations Secretary-General, to \r\ncentralize all information and draw vital comparisons \r\nbetween the various situations. Trafficking, by \r\ndefinition, knows no frontiers, and criminal interests \r\nare often the same from one crisis to another. \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the OAU \r\nin this field will be decisive. \r\n Thirdly, and lastly, there should be a much more \r\nsystematic awareness campaign against the use of child \r\nsoldiers in all countries in conflict. The Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children \r\nand Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu, and the United \r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are doing excellent \r\ngroundwork, which should be more actively supported \r\nby all the political bodies involved. \r\n The European Union attaches great importance to \r\nits regular dialogue on crisis management with the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and with \r\nAfrican regional and subregional organizations. \r\n With regard to Sierra Leone and the situation in \r\nthe three countries of the Mano River Union, the \r\nEuropean Union is in close contact with ECOWAS. A \r\npreliminary ministerial meeting between the European \r\nUnion and the West African regional organization was \r\nheld in Abuja on 15 October 2000. The European \r\nUnion also supports the efforts of the United Nations \r\nand the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone \r\n(UNAMSIL) to restore peace to the country, and calls \r\non the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to engage in \r\nthe process of demobilization, disarmament and \r\nrehabilitation provided for under the Lomé agreements. \r\nThe European Union also calls on all the States in the \r\nregion to scrupulously respect the embargo on arms for \r\nnon-governmental forces and the embargo on non-\r\ncertified diamonds imposed by Security Council \r\nresolutions 1132 (1997) and 1306 (2000). \r\n With regard to the Horn of Africa, the European \r\nUnion reiterates its full support for the diplomatic \r\nefforts by the United Nations and the OAU to resolve \r\nthe conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. It welcomes \r\nthe recent resumption of talks in Algiers with Ethiopia \r\nand Eritrea, and considers that the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea should \r\nconstitute a crucial factor in stabilizing the situation. \r\nThe European Union calls on the parties to implement \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1320 (2000). It also \r\ncommends the extremely positive results of the process \r\nconducted by President Guelleh of Djibouti regarding \r\nSomalia. The success of the Arta conference and the \r\ncreation of new Somali institutions have won the \r\nunequivocal and firm support of the international \r\ncommunity. The European Union calls all on all sides \r\nthat have not yet done so to participate in this process. \r\n The European Union reaffirms its support for \r\nUnited Nations and OAU efforts to restore peace to the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the region. It \r\nurges the parties to implement the Lusaka Ceasefire \r\nAgreement and the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. Together with regional players and \r\norganizations, particularly the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community, the OAU played an \r\nimportant part in bringing the parties to the conflict in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo to the \r\nnegotiating table in 1999 and in the signing of the \r\nLusaka Ceasefire Agreement. The OAU also made a \r\ntangible contribution to implementation of the \r\nCeasefire Agreement by sending observers, creating \r\nthe Joint Military Commission and appointing the \r\nfacilitator of the inter-Congolese national dialogue. \r\nThe European Union supports OAU efforts and \r\nprovides assistance for funding the Joint Military \r\nCommission and facilitating the national dialogue. \r\n The situation in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo remains very troubling. The Union is concerned \r\nabout the dangers of a general resumption of \r\nhostilities, which could jeopardize the United Nations \r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo (MONUC). It is essential that the OAU \r\npursue its endeavours to achieve a settlement. In this \r\nconnection, we note that the States parties to the \r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at \r\nthe recent Maputo summit, asked the OAU to assist in \r\nappointing the new Chairman of the Joint Military \r\nCommission. We also think the OAU can play an \r\nimportant role in helping overcome the deadlock \r\nstalling the inter-Congolese dialogue. \r\n Sustainable development in Africa is a priority \r\nfor the European Union. The European Union’s \r\ncommitment to Africa is based on shared interests, \r\nvalues and objectives. We wish to help Africa achieve \r\n \r\n 15 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\npeace and stability in order to improve the quality of \r\nlife of its people. A political climate conducive to \r\nrespect for human rights and good governance and an \r\nactive civil society are essential for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In this respect, development cooperation \r\nmust play an important role. \r\n The European Union remains determined to fight \r\npoverty and meet the target of halving the number of \r\npeople living in extreme poverty by 2015. The \r\nEuropean Union remains the major source of \r\ndevelopment aid for Africa. It accounts for more than \r\ntwo thirds — I repeat, more than two thirds — of total \r\nofficial development assistance to sub-Saharan Africa. \r\nDevelopment assistance plays a key role in \r\nunderpinning the policies pursued by the African \r\ncountries. This is particularly the case in the least \r\ndeveloped countries, three quarters of which are in \r\nAfrica. Donors and African countries share \r\nresponsibility for ensuring that development assistance \r\nis used effectively. \r\n With particular regard to the question of debt, I \r\nwould like to stress that the European Union considers \r\nthe enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) \r\nDebt Initiative an essential ingredient for fighting \r\npoverty and achieving sustainable development \r\nobjectives. So far the European Union has contributed \r\n68 per cent of the total payments made to the Trust \r\nFund to finance the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\nDebt Initiative. It calls on eligible countries to honour \r\ntheir international political commitments and to take \r\nthe necessary political and economic measures in order \r\nto begin this process, and to ensure that upon \r\nimplementation of the HIPC Debt Initiative, the \r\nresources mobilized are allocated to social sectors such \r\nas education and health and that they promote the rule \r\nof law, good governance, the participation of civil \r\nsociety and human development. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to highlight the European \r\nUnion’s willingness to work with all our African \r\nfriends in drawing up a draft resolution, much more \r\nfocused than those of years past, that could truly place \r\nemphasis on those issues that are a priority for renewed \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of African Unity. \r\n Mr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): I wish to \r\nbegin by associating myself with the statement made \r\nby the Ambassador of Togo, the country currently \r\npresiding over the Organization of African Unity \r\n(OAU). I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the quality and relevance of his report on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of African Unity. \r\n The review of this item is of particular \r\nimportance for Africans because, since 1960, the year \r\nof African countries’ independence, our continent has \r\nbeen a major concern of the international community \r\nand thus holds a special place on the United Nations \r\nagenda.  \r\n This interest given to Africa stems certainly from \r\nthe continent’s geopolitical position, but also, and \r\nabove all, from the diversity and complexity of the \r\npolitical, economic and social problems that African \r\nStates face. \r\n Thus, you will understand, Mr. President, the \r\nimportance that African countries, joined together in \r\nthe framework of our pan-African organization, attach \r\nto the consolidation, deepening and expansion of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of African Unity. \r\n This multifaceted cooperation is a model that \r\ntoday goes beyond the narrow scope of institutional \r\nrelations between two organizations and embraces the \r\npositive synergy of the activities and contributions of \r\nother actors on the international scene. \r\n This cooperation strives to become \r\nmultidimensional in order to better tackle all African \r\naspirations to peace, stability, development, the \r\npromotion of the rule of law, the promotion of human \r\nrights and a suitable response to the irresistible march \r\nof globalization, which is shaping contemporary \r\ninternational relations in a new way. \r\n In his report, the Secretary-General gives an \r\nexhaustive overview of the actions undertaken during \r\nthe past year, with regard to both the actions of the \r\nSecretariat itself and those of the various programmes \r\nand bodies of the two organizations in the framework \r\nof their cooperation. In this regard, I would like to \r\nwelcome and underscore in particular the decisive \r\nenthusiasm shown by both Secretaries-General in their \r\ncooperation through their regular meetings outside of \r\nOAU summits and General Assembly sessions, as well \r\nas through their regular meetings regarding crises \r\naffecting Africa in order to better coordinate their \r\nactions in the areas of policy and security. \r\n \r\n16  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\n Despite the bold reforms carried out to improve \r\nthe macroeconomic situation and to democratize \r\npolitical systems, the African continent is still shaken \r\nby many areas of tension. For example, there are the \r\ncrises in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, Burundi, Angola and, Somalia and the conflict \r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea. In those various \r\nsituations cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe OAU in the area of conflict prevention and \r\npeacekeeping has been decisive in that it has made it \r\npossible to set up technical arrangements to facilitate \r\nthe implementation of ceasefire agreements and to \r\ndeploy joint civilian and military missions, thereby \r\nstrengthening African capacities for conflict prevention \r\nand management. \r\n We should also welcome the wholehearted \r\nsupport the United Nations provides the OAU within \r\nthe framework of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict \r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. In particular, \r\nwe appreciate the United Nations interest in the OAU \r\nPeace Fund, whose resources, acquired thanks to the \r\ngenerosity of donor countries, have helped to improve \r\nthe capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeeping \r\nin Africa. \r\n With regard to following up major African crises, \r\nmy delegation notes with satisfaction that the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, in close \r\ncooperation with the OAU Secretary-General, has \r\nappointed personal representatives or envoys to Sierra \r\nLeone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola and the \r\nCentral African Republic. \r\n These various achievements are clearly \r\nencouraging, and should be attributed to the \r\ncooperation between the two organizations and the \r\nleadership of the two Secretaries-General. But this \r\nprogress, as positive as it is, has not served to stem the \r\ndissatisfaction felt by Africa towards an international \r\ncommunity that is often too reluctant to manage \r\nserious crises that break out in Africa. The relative \r\nfailure of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone \r\nand, especially, the situation in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, where the deployment of a \r\nUnited Nations mission has been indefinitely put off, \r\nare perfect illustrations of how the United Nations \r\noften fails in its duty to assist Africa in the way \r\nAfricans expect of the Organization and the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n It is in that context that Senegal congratulates the \r\nmembers of the Panel on United Nations Peace \r\nOperations. Through the report known as the Brahimi \r\nreport, the Panel’s relevant recommendations offer the \r\nUnited Nations new possibilities to reduce tensions and \r\nmanage conflicts wisely in order to allow countries \r\nravaged by war to turn their efforts towards \r\ndevelopment. This is how Senegal sees the import of \r\nthe Brahimi report and its relevant recommendations. \r\n Indeed, without peace, security and stability, \r\ndevelopment becomes empty rhetoric. But without \r\ndevelopment, peace can only be precarious. This \r\napproach, which is both didactic and dialectic, must \r\nhenceforth become the foundation of a new United \r\nNations agenda for the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of Africa. This approach is starting to be \r\nimplemented jointly by African countries and the \r\noperational agencies of the United Nations system, \r\nfollowing the example of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund \r\nand, above all, the United Nations International \r\nDevelopment Organization, which, in close \r\ncooperation with African countries, has launched a \r\nproject called Alliance for Africa’s Industrialization. \r\n Other agencies of the United Nations, such as the \r\nWorld Health Organization and the Joint United \r\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS, are also applying \r\nthemselves to the fight against the AIDS pandemic, \r\nwhich is a true scourge in Africa. We must also \r\nmention the assistance of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees on behalf of \r\nthe 7 million refugees and displaced persons on the \r\ncontinent through its programmes to assist such people \r\nand to help them return to their countries of origin. \r\n My delegation is convinced that the United \r\nNations can do more, and wants to do better, for \r\nAfrica. That was the wish expressed by the participants \r\nin the Millennium Summit in the final Declaration, \r\nwhich devoted an entire section to the specific needs of \r\nAfrica, which must be harmoniously integrated into the \r\nworld economy. We hope that this commitment of the \r\ninternational community will not be in vain, and that it \r\nwill soon lead to concrete action, given that Africa is \r\nready to undertake its share of responsibility. \r\n That responsibility is in evidence in the historic \r\ndecision taken by OAU heads of State and Government \r\nat Lomé last July to set up the African Economic Union \r\n \r\n 17 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nto forge their common destiny. Through that extremely \r\nsignificant political act, Africa is today more than ever \r\nready to mobilize all its resources to tackle the many \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century through greater \r\npolitical, economic and social integration. \r\n It goes without saying that the fulfilment of such \r\nan ambition for Africa requires time, energy and true \r\npolitical will on the part of Africans. It also requires \r\ncloser and more dynamic cooperation and a \r\ncomprehensive, concrete response from this \r\nOrganization, from the entire United Nations system \r\nand from the international community at large. My \r\ndelegation therefore earnestly appeals to States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to support the draft \r\nresolution to be submitted on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity. \r\n Mr. Darwish (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I wish at \r\nthe outset to convey our thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the comprehensive report (A/55/498) \r\nbefore the Assembly on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity \r\n(OAU). The report is of particular importance at a time \r\nwhen increasing responsibilities are being entrusted to \r\nthe OAU and when it is necessary to strengthen \r\ncooperation between the two organizations in the \r\ndiplomatic, political, military, economic, social, \r\ndevelopment and other spheres. Such cooperation is to \r\nthe benefit of Africa and helps enhance the structural \r\nand institutional capacities of the OAU — which, in \r\nEgypt’s view, constitutes the ultimate goal. \r\n I wish therefore to hail the ongoing efforts of the \r\nsecretariats of the United Nations and of the \r\nOrganization of African Unity to strengthen the \r\nmechanisms for cooperation and consultation between \r\nthe two organizations, which include at least twice-\r\nyearly meetings between the Secretaries-General of the \r\nUnited Nations and of the OAU: once during the \r\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the \r\nOAU, and once during the General Assembly session at \r\nNew York. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General indicates that \r\nin its programme of cooperation with the United \r\nNations for 2000-2002, the OAU secretariat has \r\nhighlighted a number of priority issues in which \r\ncurrent programmes need to be enhanced in order to \r\nreach the desired goals. These include: debt relief, debt \r\ncancellation and increasing resource flows; \r\nimplementation of the Treaty Establishing the African \r\nEconomic Community — the Abuja Treaty; health \r\nissues such as combating HIV/AIDS and malaria; \r\nissues of democracy such as good governance and \r\nrespect for human rights; and enhancing the capacity of \r\nthe Organization of African Unity to respond rapidly to \r\ncrises and to engage in conflict management. \r\n There is no doubt that Africa faces formidable \r\nchallenges on all those issues and that the burden of \r\narmed conflicts under way in various parts of the \r\ncontinent is growing heavier. The delegation of Egypt \r\nlooks to the world Organization to formulate specific \r\njoint programmes to attain the ambitious goals that \r\nhave been identified with respect to each of those \r\nissues. It is our hope that all organs and agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations system will participate in those \r\nprogrammes and endeavours until they achieve their \r\ndesired goals. \r\n We hope that coming years will see a \r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the OAU and the \r\nUnited Nations in all those priority fields. We hope too \r\nthat they will see further efforts to improve the \r\ninstitutional capacity of the Organization of African \r\nUnity so that it can rely on its own resources in \r\nmeeting the challenges facing the continent, \r\nspecifically the settlement and management of armed \r\nconflicts. In that context, we call on the United Nations \r\nto lend particular support to the activities of the OAU \r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and \r\nResolution, by developing its capacities in the spheres \r\nof early warning, logistical support and technical \r\nassistance, training of civilian and military personnel, \r\nand encouraging donor countries to contribute \r\ngenerously to the various trust funds set up by the \r\nUnited Nations and by the Organization of African \r\nUnity towards that noble objective. \r\n As we see from the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, over the past year the Organization of African \r\nUnity has made commendable efforts in taking the \r\ninitiative in settling armed conflicts in Africa. Africa’s \r\npolitical will has been reflected in positions taken on a \r\nnumber of issues: in West Africa, the Sierra Leone \r\nconflict; in Central Africa, the conflicts in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi; and in \r\nthe Horn of Africa, the settlement of the conflict \r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea and the establishment of \r\nSomalia’s first national Government since 1991. \r\n We welcome efforts to enhance the capacity of \r\nthe Organization of African Unity to maintain peace \r\n \r\n18  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nand security in Africa, especially through support for \r\nthe OAU Centre for Conflict Management, located in \r\nAddis Ababa. At the same time, we stress that Africa’s \r\nassumption of a greater role in this sphere must not be \r\nat the expense of the role played by the United Nations. \r\nNor should it marginalize the United Nations, which is \r\nthe organization with sole responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n In the relationship between the OAU and the \r\nUnited Nations, the latter should not rely on the \r\nformer; the OAU should rely on the United Nations to \r\nsettle wars and disputes on the continent. In our view, \r\nthe United Nations response to crises in Africa \r\nindicates that the Organization has actually begun to \r\nshoulder its responsibility after a period of inaction \r\nduring which we saw the international community \r\ngrow lax in its reaction to international crises in Africa. \r\nThe United Nations took the initiative in settling the \r\ndispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and set up the \r\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea to \r\nmaintain the peace following the 18 June 2000 signing \r\nat Algiers of an Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities. \r\nAnd rather than withdrawing from Sierra Leone when \r\ncrisis erupted in that friendly country, the United \r\nNations bolstered its military presence and intensified \r\nits efforts to put an end to the horrible war there; it has \r\nmoreover begun to deal with the regional ramifications \r\nof the Sierra Leone crisis.  \r\n It is our hope that those examples reflect a \r\nhealthy, positive approach. Here, we express our hope \r\nthat the United Nations will persist in its efforts and \r\nshow the world that it is a universal international \r\norganization that addresses African crises on an equal \r\nfooting with other crises, such as those of Kosovo and \r\nEast Timor. \r\n I wish in conclusion to reaffirm our confidence in \r\nand appreciation for the Secretary-General’s noble \r\nefforts to intensify the strong relations between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity \r\nin all spheres. Here, we reiterate the readiness of \r\nEgypt, as an active member of both organizations, to \r\nparticipate fully in activities to help attain the priority \r\ngoals that have been identified for enhancing our \r\ncontinent-wide organization and for enabling it to play \r\nits rightful role in the international community. \r\n Mr. Mesdoua (Algeria) (spoke in French): First \r\nof all, I should like to say that my delegation associates \r\nitself with the statement made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Togo on behalf of the Organization \r\nof African Unity (OAU). \r\n Just one week ago, the General Assembly \r\nconsidered the question of peace and development in \r\nAfrica on the basis of the conclusions of the Working \r\nGroup set up to monitor the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the report (A/52/871) of \r\nthe Secretary-General of April 1998. Today, Africa is \r\nonce again on the agenda of this Assembly, from the \r\nperspective of cooperation between the continent-wide \r\nOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations. \r\nIn this connection, my delegation would like to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his detailed and \r\ncomprehensive report on this question. \r\n Algeria held the chairmanship of the OAU last \r\nyear, and I should like to share with the Assembly what \r\nwe learned from that experience and offer a few \r\nsuggestions that we believe might help to improve the \r\nsubstance of our cooperation and its effectiveness in \r\nattaining the goals that have been set. \r\n Today, cooperation between the two organizations \r\nhas moved beyond a strictly institutional framework; it \r\nis now part of a new context characterized by a \r\nbeneficial international awareness of the many \r\nchallenges facing the African continent. Indeed, Africa \r\nis still affected by numerous areas of conflict, poverty \r\nthat affects more than one in three people, a heavy debt \r\nburden that jeopardizes any effort to undertake \r\neconomic development and, above all else, the terrible \r\ntragedy of the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the \r\ncontinent. \r\n It should be noted, however, that this new \r\nawareness on the part of the international community, \r\nand its commitment to help Africa face the many \r\nthreats and dangers facing the continent, is slow in \r\ndeveloping and in manifesting itself in a consistent \r\nmanner in real deeds. It is therefore essential for the \r\ncommitments made by the international community \r\nfinally to be translated into effective action.  \r\n For its part, Africa must continue to shoulder its \r\nresponsibility — as, indeed, it has never ceased to do \r\nin the past — in the main areas of conflict prevention, \r\npeacekeeping throughout the continent, the \r\nestablishment of democratic institutions within \r\ncountries and the creation of conditions propitious to \r\neconomic recovery and development, without which \r\neconomic and social progress cannot take place. \r\n \r\n 19 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\n During its chairmanship of the OAU last year, \r\nAlgeria spared no effort to coordinate African action at \r\nthe continent-wide level, consolidate the structures and \r\nmethods used by the OAU and provide it with the \r\nmeans and resources that it needed. In that context, \r\nAlgeria attached great importance to political \r\ncooperation and coordination between the OAU and \r\nthe United Nations, whose competence, experience and \r\nexpertise give it a major advantage. \r\n The United Nations was therefore involved in all \r\nOAU efforts to resolve various African conflicts. \r\nAlgeria would like to pay particular tribute to the \r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General, the Government of \r\nthe United States and the European Union for their \r\nconstant support for our efforts to mediate the conflict \r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea; we regularly kept the \r\nSecretary-General and the Security Council informed \r\nabout developments in the peace process. \r\n My country’s efforts led to the conclusion, on 18 \r\nJune 2000 in Algiers, of a ceasefire agreement that \r\nopened up the road for an equitable and lasting \r\npolitical settlement to the fratricidal conflict. The \r\nresumption of direct discussions between the two \r\ncountries last October will speed up the settlement of \r\noutstanding issues. In order to consolidate the current \r\npeace process, it is important to implement the \r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1320 (2000) \r\nby quickly deploying the 4,200 troops as part of the \r\nbroadened mandate of the United Nations Mission in \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea. \r\n The contribution of the universal organization, \r\nthat is the United Nations, working alongside the OAU \r\nand other regional African organizations, to resolving \r\nother conflicts in Africa has also been demonstrated in \r\nSierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand Somalia. A real partnership is now under way \r\nbetween the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS) and the United Nations in Sierra \r\nLeone through the United Nations Mission in Sierra \r\nLeone (UNAMSIL). The standing mechanism for \r\nconsultation and cooperation set up in this regard has \r\nmade it possible to better control the situation in that \r\ncountry. Likewise, last Friday the Security Council \r\nexpressed its support for a system of strategic \r\ncooperation involving various components of the \r\nOrganization, as well as troop-contributing countries \r\nand the members of the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States, and this approach will assist in \r\nspeeding up the return to peace in Sierra Leone. \r\n We are still worried, however, by the \r\nreappearance of the spectre of indifference on the part \r\nof the developed countries with regard to peace \r\nmissions in Africa. The difficulties encountered by the \r\nUnited Nations in finding sufficient troops for \r\nUNAMSIL — to take just one example — following \r\nauthorization by the Security Council for the \r\ndeployment of more than 20,000, are a real cause for \r\nconcern. \r\n The momentum for peace that emerged recently \r\nin Somalia, following the initiative of Djibouti, must \r\nbe given greater support so that thanks to the re-\r\nestablishment of a national authority, the Somali \r\npeople can finally regain peace and stability and begin \r\nto rebuild their country, devastated by more than a \r\ndecade of civil war. \r\n Another main aspect of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the OAU relates to economic and \r\nsocial development. The majority of African States are \r\nengaged in economic recovery processes, which must \r\nbe supported by the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community. Progress has been made in \r\nsome countries, but the overall situation of African \r\neconomies is still of overwhelming concern, and the \r\ncontinent continues to face many problems, including \r\ndebt, the drying up of resources and persistent poverty. \r\n Efforts are being made at the national level, yet, \r\nparadoxically, official development assistance is still \r\ndecreasing, and the commitment made by rich \r\ncountries to commit 0.7 per cent of their gross \r\ndomestic product is far from being fulfilled. \r\nFurthermore, as the Secretary-General noted in his \r\nreport on the causes of conflict in Africa, even when \r\naid is forthcoming, 70 per cent of it is redirected back \r\nto the rich countries through the hiring of consultants \r\nand other technical advisers. \r\n The main economic challenge facing Africa today \r\nis, without doubt, the external debt, which has been \r\nestimated at more than $350 billion. This is a heavy \r\nburden and represents an unprecedented haemorrhage \r\nof its resources. At the extraordinary OAU summit held \r\nin Surt in 1999, Algerian President Abdelaziz \r\nBouteflika and South African President Thabo Mbeki \r\nwere called on by their peers to defend the request to \r\nthe developed countries and multilateral institutions to \r\ncancel African debt. While it is true that progress has \r\nbeen made, inasmuch as creditor countries are more \r\naware of the vital importance to Africa of this matter, it \r\n \r\n20  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nis also true that the timid initiatives taken in the past \r\nfew months to ease the debt burden of some African \r\ncountries, among them the least developed countries, \r\nfall far short of what had been hoped for. \r\n Likewise, there has been a constant erosion in the \r\nresources of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and other specialized agencies in the \r\nUnited Nations system, which has forced these bodies \r\nto make difficult choices. This situation must be \r\nresolved in order to enable them to play their role in \r\nsupporting efforts at recovery in Africa. \r\n Humanitarian work is another equally important \r\narea in the framework of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the OAU. The African continent \r\ntoday is host to more than half of the approximately 20 \r\nmillion refugees throughout the world, yet Africa does \r\nnot receive the attention it should given its truly tragic \r\nsituation, nor does it get a fair share of the resources \r\nallocated in the context of humanitarian assistance. My \r\ndelegation would like the situation to be remedied, \r\nthrough, inter alia, the implementation of the plan of \r\naction for African refugees that emanated from the \r\njoint OAU-United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees (UNHCR) meeting of March 2000. \r\n As we have seen, there are many \r\nmultidimensional areas for cooperation between the \r\nOAU and the United Nations. They deal, inter alia, \r\nwith questions as varied as the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, institutional assistance, support for economic \r\nprogrammes, assistance to refugees and the combat \r\nagainst epidemics. \r\n Experience has shown the need for, and the \r\nusefulness of, such cooperation, which, despite our \r\ncommon will to promote it, continues to feel the effects \r\nof the scarcity of resources. Only with assistance from \r\nthe United Nations will it be able to implement its \r\noverall mission and, in respect to the issues we are \r\ndealing with today, to bring to a successful conclusion \r\nthe many projects in which it is involved in the context \r\nof cooperation with the OAU. \r\n In this respect, Africa has genuine hopes for the \r\nforthcoming special conferences of the United Nations \r\non the AIDS pandemic and on financing for \r\ndevelopment. We expect from these conferences and \r\nfrom our partners specific commitments and innovative \r\nproposals that will lead to concrete actions to help \r\nAfrica. \r\n In conclusion, let me say that at the Millennium \r\nSummit, world leaders, meeting on a unique and \r\nhistoric occasion, made solemn commitments to \r\nsupport peace and development in the African \r\ncontinent in particular. We hope that the Declaration \r\nadopted on that occasion will herald a new era in our \r\ncollective effort to take up the many challenges and \r\ncounter the many threats facing peace and development \r\nin Africa. The United Nations, whose central mission \r\nwas recognized in the Millennium Declaration, must \r\nplay a paramount role in this respect. \r\n Mr. Satoh (Japan): As I stressed at last year’s \r\nmeeting, the importance of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, particularly \r\nin addressing the issues of conflict prevention and \r\neconomic development, can never be overstated. Japan \r\ntherefore supports the efforts to enhance cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), as outlined in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. \r\n The OAU has long been engaged in activities to \r\nadvance the cause of peace and prosperity in Africa. Its \r\nefforts were instrumental in facilitating the peace \r\nagreements on the conflicts in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, \r\nBurundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and, \r\nmost recently, between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The \r\ncessation of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea is \r\nindeed encouraging, and I wish to commend the OAU \r\nfor its diligent efforts to date. However, further efforts \r\nby all concerned — including the United Nations \r\nMission for Ethiopia and Eritrea, led by our former \r\ncolleague, Ambassador Legwaila — are required in \r\norder to attain durable peace between the two \r\ncountries. \r\n The OAU’s comprehensive framework of the \r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and \r\nResolution in Africa is important testimony to the \r\ndetermination on the part of African countries to \r\nadvance the cause of peace on the continent. Yet it is \r\nobvious that the OAU needs greater cooperation and \r\nsupport from the international community. United \r\nNations cooperation with the OAU is particularly \r\nessential in order to ensure that the comprehensive \r\nframework functions effectively. The support of other \r\npartners in the developed world is also indispensable. \r\n Japan, for its part, is prepared to assist the OAU \r\nin its efforts for conflict prevention, management and \r\nresolution. It has already extended a number of \r\n \r\n 21 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nfinancial contributions to the OAU Peace Fund, which \r\nhave been utilized for various conflict prevention and \r\ndemocratization activities. Most recently, Japan \r\nassisted the OAU peacekeeping mission in Ethiopia \r\nand Eritrea, particularly in establishing the OAU \r\nliaison offices in Addis Ababa and Asmara. We remain \r\ncommitted to supporting the OAU’s efforts in pursuit \r\nof peace. \r\n There is another dimension in which Japan \r\nfacilitates cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe OAU. The so-called Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development (TICAD) process, \r\nwhich Japan has been promoting since 1993, is \r\ncontributing greatly to cooperation between the OAU \r\nand the United Nations system, particularly the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP). The \r\nTICAD process focuses on sustainable development in \r\nAfrica as well as on conflict prevention. It also \r\nsupports the OAU’s Comprehensive Framework. \r\nMoreover, the participation of several Asian countries \r\nin the TICAD process is broadening the base of support \r\nfor African development and promoting cooperation \r\nbetween the OAU and the United Nations system. \r\n I want to remind the Assembly in this context that \r\nForeign Minister Yohei Kono announced in his \r\nstatement to the General Assembly this September that \r\nJapan had decided to hold a ministerial meeting on \r\nAfrican development in fiscal year 2001, with a view \r\nto making preparations for the third Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development \r\n(TICAD III). We hope that the proposed ministerial \r\nmeeting will add further political momentum to the \r\nTICAD process and help strengthen cooperation \r\nbetween the OAU and the United Nations system. \r\n As the Millennium Declaration rightly \r\nunderlined, Africa will require special attention in the \r\ncoming years in many different contexts, including \r\nefforts to eradicate poverty and debt, prevent conflict \r\nand address the issue of small arms, and combat AIDS \r\nand other diseases. Against this backdrop, the \r\nresponsibility of the OAU is greater than ever, as is the \r\nneed for the international community, and the United \r\nNations in particular, to extend support and \r\ncooperation to this valuable African organization. \r\n Japan, for its part, is prepared to do its best in \r\norder to support the OAU and African countries in their \r\nstruggle with the difficult problems they face. \r\n Mr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset to express to the Secretary-General, on \r\nbehalf of the Tunisian delegation, our gratitude and \r\nappreciation for his valuable report on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), and for his efforts to promote \r\nthis cooperation. \r\n Ever since its inception, the OAU has reflected \r\nthe aspirations of African peoples and countries for a \r\nunited continent. It has played a crucial role in \r\nasserting the legitimate political aspirations of the \r\ncontinent and in promoting rapprochement, solidarity \r\nand cooperation among African peoples and countries. \r\nIt has served as an ideal collective African framework \r\nfor action. \r\n Tunisia attaches particular importance to \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU \r\nand to means for enhancing this cooperation. We \r\nwelcome the priority status, that Africa has acquired on \r\nthe United Nations agenda, especially as a result of the \r\nmany programmes and initiatives related to this \r\ncontinent that the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies have established and of the ongoing \r\ncoordination between the two organizations on issues \r\nrelating to the continent, especially in the fields of \r\ninternational peace and security and economic and \r\nsocial development. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General highlights \r\nmany of the areas and levels of cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the OAU. While we welcome \r\nall the achievements that have been made, we call for a \r\nfollow-up and for a continuation of these efforts in \r\norder to promote cooperation and coordination, since \r\nAfrica and its regional organization face many \r\nchallenges that require greater commitment on the part \r\nof the international community, especially by the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n My delegation welcomes the practice of regular \r\nconsultations that both Secretaries-General have \r\nconsistently followed. We also welcome the \r\ndiscussions held by high officials from the two \r\norganizations in certain areas. These will strengthen \r\nthe cooperative ties between the organizations. \r\n The African continent has been working in the \r\ncontext of the OAU and other subregional \r\norganizations, first, by relying on its own resources in \r\norder to address its own problems, and, secondly, by \r\n \r\n22  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nrelying on the solidarity and support of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n In recent years the African continent has \r\nwitnessed many acute struggles that threatened peace \r\nand security and led to difficult humanitarian \r\nsituations, with tragic economic and social dimensions. \r\nThe Security Council, as the highest authority in the \r\nfield of the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, has attached great importance to these \r\nstruggles. The numerous meetings that the Council has \r\ndevoted to addressing these issues this year have \r\nprovided many opportunities for assessing and \r\norganizing cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe OAU in the field of peace and security in Africa \r\nand the means to support them. \r\n Africa has made many efforts to contribute to the \r\nsettlement of conflicts in a way that guarantees peace \r\nand security, supports stability and provides for \r\ndevelopment. However, despite the attempts at \r\nconciliation and the initiatives undertaken by many \r\nAfrican leaders, in coordination with the United \r\nNations and the OAU, many of the complex conflicts \r\nhave yet to be fully resolved. \r\n Africa has given priority to the issue of dispute \r\nsettlement and to conflict prevention, management and \r\nresolution. The mechanism created by the OAU for this \r\npurpose has played a positive role in this field, despite \r\nlimited resources. This mechanism reflects the resolve \r\nof African States to rely on their own resources to \r\nsolve the problems of the continent. At the same time, \r\nthese States remain keenly interested in coordinating \r\ntheir efforts with the United Nations. \r\n In this context we would like to reaffirm Africa’s \r\ndetermination to shoulder its responsibilities. However, \r\nthis determination should not relieve the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations of their \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOAU in the field of peace and security has resulted in \r\nmany achievements in past years. These efforts should \r\nbe enhanced. We call upon the United Nations and its \r\nMember States to increase their support for the OAU in \r\norder to strengthen its institutional capacities. \r\n In recent years Africa has made many efforts in \r\nthe field of development, enhancing the principles of \r\ndialogue, democracy and human rights, and supporting \r\nregional cooperation and economic integration by \r\nimplementing the Abuja Agreement, which created the \r\nAfrican Economic Community. We hope our partners \r\nwill continue to provide their support for this objective. \r\n In this regard, we look forward to a prompt \r\nsolution to the debt problem and to more support for \r\nthe efforts to eradicate poverty and disease, open \r\ninternational markets to African products and attract \r\ngreater direct foreign investment. We would like to \r\nexpress our appreciation for the numerous initiatives to \r\nenhance sustainable development in Africa undertaken \r\nby the United Nations, its specialized agencies and the \r\nBretton Woods institutions. We call for greater \r\ncoordination for the success of these initiatives. My \r\ndelegation would like to praise the positive initiatives \r\nundertaken by many of our African partners in order to \r\ndevelop and increase cooperation and coordination. \r\n As the United Nations and the OAU prepare to \r\nmove to the next phase of their cooperation and \r\ncoordination, we hope that, after a review of past \r\nachievements, cooperation will be enhanced and \r\ncoordination will be based on various political, \r\neconomic and social elements so as to serve \r\ninternational peace, security, stability and development \r\nin Africa, enhance the role of the United Nations and \r\nadvance its principles and purposes. \r\n Mr. Shinkaiye (Nigeria): Nigeria wishes at the \r\noutset to express its full support for the statement made \r\nby the representative of Togo on behalf of the \r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). We also thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his detailed report on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU. \r\nWe request that all the programmes identified in the \r\nreport be implemented. \r\n My delegation attaches great importance to this \r\nagenda item for many reasons, which we need not \r\nrecount here. Suffice it to say that cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations, the world’s only truly universal \r\norganization, and the OAU, the only continental \r\norganization that binds the variegated regions and \r\npeoples of Africa together, has not only symbolic, but \r\nalso substantive significance for us in Africa. \r\n It is commonly acknowledged — and we in \r\nAfrica are the first to admit this — that our continent \r\nconstitutes the weakest segment of the chain that links \r\nthe global family of nations and peoples. The myriad \r\nproblems that currently afflict the continent are very \r\nwell known and have, in fact, been the subject of \r\nintense debate and discussion at this and other \r\n \r\n 23 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nsessions. Only last week, this Assembly devoted time \r\nto the discussion of how to tackle the continent’s many \r\nconflicts and promote sustainable development. \r\n Irrespective of the nature, sources or causes of \r\nthe problems and challenges facing Africa, one fact is \r\nincontrovertible. Many of these problems, by their very \r\nnature, cannot be resolved successfully by African \r\ncountries acting alone or even acting together. They \r\nhave to be resolved in cooperation with the continent’s \r\ndevelopment partners and the wider international \r\ncommunity. Cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Organization of African Unity should therefore, \r\namong other objectives, be aimed at realizing this goal. \r\nBesides, this cooperation is a vivid demonstration of \r\nthe principles of international solidarity and testimony \r\nto Africa’s shared humanity with the rest of the global \r\ncommunity. \r\n Over the years, cooperation between the two \r\norganizations, begun in 1965 and based primarily on \r\nthe principle of mutual respect, has grown wider and \r\ndeeper to encompass very many issues and concerns \r\nnot even contemplated at the beginning. It has also \r\ngrown to include not only cooperation between the \r\nOAU and the United Nations alone, but also between \r\nthe OAU and the United Nations specialized agencies. \r\nThe Nigerian delegation welcomes this development. \r\n Nevertheless, we urge that we do not rest on our \r\noars, as the African situation calls for not only an \r\nintensification of this cooperation, but, more important, \r\na rigorous review of its content and scope. At no time \r\nhas this cooperation been more urgently needed than \r\nnow, given the worsening situation of the African \r\ncontinent, which is increasingly being further \r\nmarginalized. It is for this reason that we welcome the \r\nactivities of the United Nations liaison office with the \r\nOAU, which has led to enhanced cooperation, \r\ncoordination and exchange of information with the \r\nOAU in a number of areas. \r\n It is the view of the Nigerian delegation that a \r\nnumber of priority areas have to be identified if the \r\ncooperative activities between the United Nations and \r\nthe OAU are to be well focused and well targeted. \r\nHere, we have in mind such areas as capacity-building \r\nin all its ramifications, but especially in the areas of \r\nconflict resolution and post-conflict peace-building, \r\nincluding the question of refugees and displaced \r\npersons. Other areas should include the promotion of \r\ngood governance, transparency and accountability; \r\npoverty eradication; control and management of the \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria and major infectious \r\ndiseases, such as tuberculosis; as well as issues \r\npertaining to economic growth and development, \r\nespecially the external debt crisis which the continent \r\ncurrently faces. This list of issues is, of course, not \r\nexhaustive, but only indicative. \r\n Africa’s capacity for dealing with these issues has \r\nto be enhanced if we are committed to arresting the \r\ncontinent’s downward slide. The emergence of a few \r\npockets of progress and hope on the continent, while \r\nwelcomed, is nowhere near a critical mass that can give \r\nthe process of rejuvenation a momentum of its own to \r\nbecome sustainable. \r\n In further fine-tuning of the existing cooperation \r\nbetween the two organizations, the Nigerian delegation \r\nwould like to see greater assistance given by the United \r\nNations to the OAU Mechanism for Conflict \r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution, given the \r\nravages caused by the many conflicts that have put \r\nAfrica’s efforts to reverse its underdevelopment at \r\nenormous risk. In this connection, we draw attention to \r\nthe resolutions and decisions taken by African leaders \r\nat the Thirty-sixth Ordinary Session of the Assembly of \r\nHeads of State and Government of the OAU, which \r\nmet in Lomé, Togo, from 10 to 12 July 2000, and \r\nespecially the Solemn Declaration on the Conference \r\non Security, Stability, Development and Cooperation in \r\nAfrica. We hope that the expected assistance from the \r\ninternational community, including the United Nations, \r\nwill be forthcoming to enable full implementation of \r\nthat Declaration. \r\n Allow me to refer to a few specific areas in which \r\ncooperation between the two organizations has led to \r\nvery positive developments. I have in mind the \r\ncollaborative efforts between the United Nations and \r\nthe OAU in conflict management and resolution. This \r\nhas not only resulted in a peace agreement between \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, but promises to provide a durable \r\nsolution to this sad conflict between two brother \r\nnations. Nigeria applauds the efforts deployed by both \r\norganizations which have made this possible, and we \r\nurge that the process be pursued to its logical \r\nconclusion. \r\n The Ethiopia-Eritrea peace process is a clear \r\nindication of what benefits the world can derive when \r\nour global Organization works closely with regional or \r\ncontinental organizations, such as the OAU, in dealing \r\n \r\n24  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\nwith a serious crisis. Nigeria therefore fully supports \r\nthe cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOAU in dealing with other conflicts, such as those in \r\nAngola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and Western Sahara. \r\n Nigeria, however, urges the United Nations to \r\nalso involve the OAU more closely in its peace efforts \r\nin Sierra Leone. We recall that the OAU, like the \r\nUnited Nations, fully participated in the process \r\nleading to the Lomé Peace Agreement, and both \r\norganizations are guarantors of the Agreement. We \r\nadmit that the OAU itself was somewhat laid back after \r\nthe agreement was signed and does not have the \r\nresources to play a more visible role. Nevertheless, we \r\nbelieve that the OAU can help, and the United Nations \r\nshould work closely with the OAU Secretary General’s \r\nSpecial Envoy on Sierra Leone, Ambassador Kingsley \r\nMamabolo of South Africa. \r\n Finally, on the subject of conflicts in Africa, \r\nNigeria appeals to the United Nations to take a new \r\nlook at the situation in Somalia, that unfortunate \r\ncountry that has been ravaged by conflict for so long. \r\nAs the Central Organ of the OAU Conflict \r\nManagement Mechanism recently urged, every support \r\nshould be given to the recently elected Somali \r\nPresident and the Transitional National Assembly in \r\norder to ensure that national unity and central \r\nGovernment are restored in the country. The process \r\nclearly shows that the Somali people want peace, and \r\nthe world should not abandon them. Due tribute should \r\nbe paid to the President of Djibouti for his valiant \r\neffort in furtherance of this noble objective. He has \r\nhelped to give hope to the people of Somalia and \r\ndeserves our commendation. \r\n Nigeria welcomes the cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the OAU in response to the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s request that the United Nations \r\nand its specialized agencies — notably the United \r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization, the World Health Organization, the \r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and others — should \r\ntake appropriate steps to complement, in a coordinated \r\nmanner, the fight against HIV/AIDS. In this regard, we \r\nsupport the Economic Commission for Africa in Addis \r\nAbaba, which is organizing in December this year its \r\nsecond annual African Development Forum, the theme \r\nthis year being “AIDS: The Greatest Leadership \r\nChallenge.” The OAU is involved in the programme. \r\nWe appeal to the United Nations to reciprocate by \r\njoining hands with the OAU, which will organize in \r\nAbuja, Nigeria, some time next year, an African \r\nsummit on HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. It \r\nis our hope that, with such collaborative efforts, Africa \r\nwill be in a position to halt the HIV/AIDS virus, which \r\nis currently ravaging the continent. \r\n The Nigerian delegation would like to conclude \r\nby commending the Secretary-General for his tireless \r\nefforts to keep African issues on the front burner of the \r\nUnited Nations agenda, despite the critical resource \r\nconstraints that our Organization continues to face. The \r\nGovernments and peoples of Africa are truly indebted \r\nto him and to all the Governments that have \r\ndemonstrated faith in Africa’s capacity to overcome its \r\ncurrent multifaceted challenges. Although the primary \r\nresponsibility for meeting these challenges lies with \r\nthe continent and its leaders, they can be truly \r\naddressed only in concert with Africa’s development \r\npartners and the wider international community. \r\n Our world will certainly be a better place when \r\nAfrica takes its rightful place as a respected member of \r\nthe global family. We look forward to that day, and it is \r\nour belief that this is a realizable objective. The United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies have a \r\nresponsibility and indeed a duty to support Africa’s \r\npolitical, social and economic recovery, as was rightly \r\nagreed by world leaders in the Millennium Declaration \r\nwhich they recently adopted. Let us all resolve to fully \r\nimplement that Declaration. \r\n Mr. Hønningstad (Norway): Allow me first to \r\nwelcome this opportunity again to discuss \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of African Unity”. The mere fact that \r\nmuch of Africa is still ravaged by serious armed \r\nconflicts, droughts and continued underdevelopment \r\nunderlines the great importance of strong and practical \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). Norway \r\nbelieves that such cooperation is beneficial to both \r\norganizations and will further their high ambitions to \r\nassist conflict prevention and resolution and the \r\neconomic and social development of the African \r\nnations. \r\n Norway has called for strengthened coordination \r\nand increased cooperation between the two \r\norganizations, and is therefore encouraged by the \r\nstrong commitment of the Secretary-General to \r\nenhancing such cooperation. The increased practical \r\n \r\n 25 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nimplementation of cooperation arrangements over the \r\nlast few years constitutes a strong platform for an even \r\ncloser relationship. Indeed, Norway will push for such \r\nenhanced cooperation and coordination when we take \r\nour seat on the Security Council. The increasing \r\nparticipation of the OAU in the United Nations, its \r\norgans and specialized agencies makes a very valuable \r\ncontribution towards this aim. \r\n Much has happened since the decision by the \r\nOAU in 1993 to relinquish its non-intervention policy \r\nand to establish the Mechanism for Conflict \r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. The OAU is \r\nnow actively engaged in trying to solve all ongoing \r\nconflicts on the continent. Although much remains to \r\nbe done to have a fully operational OAU Mechanism, \r\nassistance from the United Nations and bilateral \r\npartners of the OAU has strengthened its capacity. \r\nHowever, further efforts by the United Nations to assist \r\nthe OAU in enhancing this capacity and facilitating \r\ncloser cooperation is called for. Norway will continue \r\nto support the Mechanism, and calls for United Nations \r\ntechnical assistance and for staff exchange programmes \r\nto be put in place. \r\n The effects of the many ongoing conflicts in \r\nAfrica only exacerbate poverty and underdevelopment, \r\nthe HIV/Aids pandemic, the high debt burden, drought \r\nand hunger on the African continent. The coordinated \r\nefforts of the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity to resolve the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict \r\nis one encouraging example of close cooperation in the \r\ncause of peace. Although the stakes are high, the \r\nexpectation that the conflict will be solved should, \r\nhopefully, be met. Through their combined efforts, the \r\ntwo organizations should be able to convince the \r\nparties of the benefits of peace and the need for \r\ncooperation. \r\n The conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, Angola, the Sudan, Sierra Leone and Somalia \r\nare still unresolved and require the attention of a joint \r\nUnited Nations-OAU effort as well as the constructive \r\nengagement of the parties to the conflicts and all \r\nMember States in the region. The United Nations and \r\nthe OAU should take the lead in urging African leaders \r\nto become leaders for peace and development. Without \r\nthe strong commitment of African leaders to peace, the \r\nrole of the United Nations and the OAU will only be \r\none of “damage control”. \r\n On a positive note, Norway would like to \r\nmention the close cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the OAU in the areas of eradication of \r\nsmall arms and landmines. Norway urges the \r\norganizations to cooperate even more closely to \r\nalleviate the burden of destruction caused by mines and \r\nsmall arms in countries on the African continent. \r\nNorway takes this opportunity to point out the positive \r\nengagement by the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) in agreeing to a moratorium \r\non the sale of and trafficking in small arms. This \r\nshould serve as an example to be followed by others. \r\n The OAU is currently undergoing a restructuring \r\nprocess to which a group of countries — the Friends of \r\nthe OAU — has been contributing. When this \r\nrestructuring process has been implemented the “new” \r\nOAU will, hopefully, be better equipped to face the \r\nchallenges of the new millennium. The possibility of \r\nfurther developing the concept of the Friends of the \r\nOAU — with United Nations participation — should \r\nbe considered. This could enhance cooperation of all \r\nexternal organizations and countries with the OAU. It \r\nwould also alleviate the administrative burden on the \r\nOAU Secretariat. This would allow the OAU to \r\ndevelop a more programmatic approach to its \r\nactivities, which could enhance the organization’s \r\nefficiency. Norway will strongly support such an \r\ninitiative and encourage the United Nations to work \r\nwith the OAU to develop such an approach. \r\n Cooperation and coordination between the United \r\nNations and the OAU is especially important in \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping \r\noperations. However, with regard to regional and \r\nsubregional efforts to achieve stronger economic and \r\npolitical integration, the United Nations could also play \r\na pivotal role in assisting the OAU and the subregional \r\nAfrican organizations to realize this. The contribution \r\nof subregional efforts towards the goal of an African \r\nEconomic Community should be encouraged. Thus, a \r\nstronger United Nations supportive role for economic \r\nintegration should be emphasized, and stronger OAU \r\ninvolvement in the Economic and Social Council \r\n(ECOSOC) should be fostered. \r\n The Norwegian Government would like to \r\nemphasize that the United Nations should play a \r\nstronger role in coordinating development assistance to \r\nthe African continent. We would also like to forge \r\ncloser ties of cooperation with regional and subregional \r\norganizations. Such efforts, combined with a \r\n \r\n26  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\ncontinuation of bilateral development cooperation and \r\nassistance through various United Nations initiatives, \r\nshow our strong commitment to African development. \r\nWe therefore urge the different United Nations \r\nagencies to intensify the coordination of their regional \r\nprogrammes in Africa and to strengthen their \r\nharmonization with African regional and subregional \r\nprogrammes. \r\n Let me close by recalling chapter VII of the \r\nMillennium Declaration, “Meeting the special needs of \r\nAfrica”. For the goals and aspirations of this chapter of \r\nthe Declaration to come true and be speedily \r\nimplemented, we will all depend on a new partnership \r\nwith Africa. The OAU should play a pivotal role in \r\nsuch a partnership. \r\n Mr. Hussein (Ethiopia): At the outset, I wish to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of African Unity. As in previous years, \r\nthe report provides a clear description of the activities \r\nundertaken by the two organizations in the framework \r\nof their ongoing cooperation. \r\n My delegation notes with satisfaction the \r\nincreased cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe OAU, as set out in the Secretary-General’s report. \r\nWe welcome the continued practice of holding regular \r\nconsultations between the secretariats of the two \r\norganizations, the most recent example being the \r\nmeeting held at the headquarters of the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa in Addis Ababa, on 10 and 11 \r\nApril 2000. As agreed by the two secretariats, the \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of African Unity needs to be further \r\nconsolidated. This can be done by placing greater \r\nemphasis on steps that will enhance the institutional \r\ncapacity of the OAU and the mobilization of resources \r\nfor the implementation of the priorities and programme \r\nareas identified by the meeting. \r\n Regarding the mechanisms for enhancing United \r\nNations-OAU cooperation, the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations Liaison Office with the OAU definitely \r\nconstitutes an important step. We note that the Liaison \r\nOffice has been entrusted with important tasks that \r\nneed to be undertaken in close cooperation and \r\ncoordination with the OAU. \r\n My delegation attaches particular importance to \r\nthe cooperation between the two organizations in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security, in accordance with \r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nDuring the past year, the OAU has continued its efforts \r\naimed at the peaceful settlement of conflicts in the \r\ncontinent. \r\n My country fully supports these efforts of the \r\nOAU, and has on various occasions made its own \r\ncontributions to the resolution of conflicts in different \r\nparts of Africa. With respect to the crisis between \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, Ethiopia has demonstrated its full \r\nrespect for and commitment to the OAU by \r\ncooperating with its efforts to resolve the crisis. These \r\nefforts of the OAU, with the cooperation and assistance \r\nof the United Nations and other interested parties, led \r\nto the signing of the Agreement on Cessation of \r\nHostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea in Algiers on \r\n18 June 2000. The Agreement on Cessation of \r\nHostilities provides, that a “Peacekeeping Mission \r\nshall be deployed by the United Nations under the \r\nauspices of OAU”. (S/2000/627, enclosure, para. 2) It \r\nfurther stipulates, in paragraph 4, that “The size and \r\nthe composition of the Peacekeeping Mission shall be \r\nadapted to the mission assigned to it and shall be \r\ndetermined by the Secretaries-General of the United \r\nNations and OAU, with the acceptance of the two \r\nParties.” Furthermore, in accordance with paragraph 14 \r\nof the Agreement of Cessation of Hostilities, the OAU \r\nand the United Nations commit themselves to \r\nguarantee the respect for this commitment undertaken \r\nby the parties in the Agreement. \r\n Against this backdrop, the Security Council, in \r\nparagraph 4 of Security Council resolution 1320 \r\n(2000), establishing the United Nations Mission in \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, requested the Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations “to coordinate with the \r\nOrganization of African Unity in the implementation of \r\nthe Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities”.  \r\n In this regard, I wish to take this opportunity to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his continued efforts, \r\nincluding his appointment of Ambassador Mohamed \r\nSahnoun as his Special Envoy in dealing with the \r\nconflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s intention to continue collaborating \r\nwith the OAU in supporting the subsequent phase of its \r\nmediation efforts in the implementation of the \r\nAgreement on Cessation of Hostilities. \r\n In the area of economic and social development, \r\nAfrica continues to face serious challenges. Despite the \r\nefforts of most African countries, the economic \r\n \r\n 27 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nsituation in the continent remains precarious, and \r\neconomic recovery and development continue to be \r\nseverely hindered by multiple factors. The persistence \r\nof conflicts, debt burden, the decline in official \r\ndevelopment assistance, the net outflow of resources \r\nand the question of access to world markets, to \r\nmention just a few factors, are paralysing growth and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. As these challenges continue to \r\ngrow, the situation in the continent, including the role \r\nthat the United Nations could play in cooperation with \r\nthe OAU, needs a close and an objective evaluation. \r\n In spite of the challenges and difficulties, \r\nespecially in mobilizing international support for \r\nAfrica, the United Nations has remained engaged \r\nthrough its various agencies in many vital areas related \r\nto African economic recovery and development. In this \r\ncontext, my delegation also acknowledges the \r\nimportant role of the United Nations Economic \r\nCommission for Africa, which, in cooperation with the \r\nOrganization of African Unity and the African \r\nDevelopment Bank, continues to play a crucial role in \r\nthe establishment and consolidation of the African \r\nEconomic Community and the subregional economic \r\ncommunities, which will serve as building blocks for \r\nthe Community. Cooperation over the past year \r\nbetween the OAU and various United Nations \r\nagencies, such as the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, the World \r\nFood Programme, the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization, the United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development and others, has also been quite \r\nencouraging. \r\n With regard to issues related to social matters, we \r\nwelcome the achievements made through the OAU’s \r\ncooperation with, among others, the United Nations \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Refugees \r\n(UNHCR), the International Labour Organization, the \r\nWorld Health Organization and the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The \r\nprogress that the OAU and UNHCR have made with \r\nrespect to the welfare of refugees in Africa is \r\nparticularly worth mentioning. Similarly, the important \r\nsupport of WHO in critical areas such as polio \r\neradication, malaria prevention and control and the \r\nstruggle against HIV/AIDS in Africa needs to be \r\nfurther enhanced. In this respect, we welcome the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations-OAU task force \r\nthat would articulate a plan of action in the fight \r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, to be achieved, we hope, in the \r\nnext two years. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nappeal to United Nations agencies, the international \r\ncommunity and donor countries to give more attention \r\nto Africa’s struggle against the HIV/AIDS scourge, \r\nwhich is afflicting the continent to an alarming degree. \r\n Since its establishment in 1963, the Organization \r\nof African Unity has endeavoured in pursuit of the \r\nlofty objectives envisioned by the founding fathers to \r\nmeet the multifaceted challenges facing Africa. In the \r\narea of peace and security, the OAU’s efforts have \r\nculminated in the setting up of the Mechanism for \r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in \r\nAfrica, while in the sphere of economic development \r\nand regional economic integration, the conclusion of \r\nthe Abuja Treaty and the establishment of the African \r\nEconomic Community mark yet other milestone \r\nachievements. \r\n These achievements and the efforts of Africa in \r\ngeneral could be sustained and further enhanced only \r\nin a favourable international environment of genuine \r\npartnership on the part of the rest of the world. In this \r\nregard, the role of the United Nations and its \r\ncooperation with the OAU will remain indispensable in \r\nthe years to come. \r\n Mr. Urib (Namibia): Allow me first of all to \r\nassociate my delegation with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Togo on behalf of the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity (OAU). I would also like to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Organization of African Unity. The report \r\ncovers a wide range of issues which are important to \r\nboth organizations. Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the OAU will strengthen the capacity of \r\nthe OAU in responding to the increasing needs of its \r\nmember States, and we believe in this way it will \r\ncontribute to attainment of the goals of the United \r\nNations. \r\n In this context, we welcome the ongoing contacts \r\nand consultations between the United Nations \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs and the OAU \r\nPermanent Observer Mission in New York. Similarly, \r\ncooperation between the OAU and the special envoys \r\nof the Secretary-General of the United Nations provide \r\nan important and direct link, especially in the area of \r\nconflict prevention and management.  \r\n \r\n28  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\n We note the contribution of United Nations \r\nexperts in the design of peace agreements in Sierra \r\nLeone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to \r\nmention but two examples. However, timely action by \r\nthe United Nations Security Council in the \r\nimplementation of peace agreements in Africa is \r\ncrucial and can either make or break those agreements. \r\nWe also concur with the view of the Secretary-General \r\nthat continuous provision of much-needed support for \r\npeacekeeping activities in Africa is vital. The Brahimi \r\nreport speaks eloquently to these issues, and we must \r\nall ensure the early implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained therein. \r\n In that connection, we reiterate our call on the \r\ninternational community — especially the donor \r\ncountries — to contribute to the Trust Fund for \r\nImproving Preparedness for Conflict Prevention and \r\nPeacekeeping in Africa, as well as to the OAU Peace \r\nFund aimed at building African peacekeeping \r\ncapacities. The need for additional financial resources \r\nto enhance cooperation cannot be overemphasized.  \r\n The humanitarian needs of African refugees and \r\ninternally displaced persons also need concerted efforts \r\nby the international community. We have said it before, \r\nand we would like to reiterate again, that the \r\nOrganization and, indeed, the international community, \r\ncannot afford to give up on African refugees and other \r\ndisplaced persons in various parts of the African \r\ncontinent. The provision of support by the Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to the OAU \r\nin developing its institutional capacity for humanitarian \r\ncoordination and exchange of early-warning \r\ninformation is therefore crucial, and must be \r\nstrengthened.  \r\n We must do everything to eliminate the problem \r\nof refugees and internally displaced persons in Africa \r\nand the world at large. We must also recognize the \r\ndisproportionately high price paid by countries hosting \r\nrefugees. In the case of Africa, many of those countries \r\nare among the least developed on the continent. Thus \r\nthe problem of refugees places an added burden on \r\ntheir already weak economies. We call for increased \r\nsupport to those countries. We also recognize the \r\ndifficulties faced by the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Africa, \r\nand call on the international community to respond \r\npositively and adequately to the appeals of UNHCR so \r\nas to enable it to cater to the needs of refugees in \r\nAfrica. \r\n Notwithstanding the current economic and social \r\ndifficulties, many African countries are making \r\ntremendous efforts to achieve sustained economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development in Africa. The \r\nestablishment of the African Economic Community is \r\ntherefore an important phase of the African \r\ndevelopment process that will assist in consolidating \r\nthe efforts of African countries to revive and develop \r\nAfrican economies. In that context, the Second \r\nIndustrial Development Decade for Africa can make a \r\nmeaningful contribution through the full and effective \r\nimplementation of the programme for the Decade.  \r\n Furthermore, support to the United Nations \r\nIndustrial Development Organization is also critical to \r\nenable that organization to carry out its programmes in \r\nAfrica. In addition, the continued cooperation between \r\nthe OAU and the secretariat of the United Nations \r\nConference for Trade and Development is welcome, for \r\nit contributes to assisting African countries in \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations. We call upon the \r\ninternational community to support the capacity of \r\nAfrican countries to derive optimal benefits from \r\nglobalization and to deal with the risks and challenges \r\nit poses. In that connection, the early implementation \r\nof the United Nations Millennium Declaration will \r\ncertainly hasten the achievement of that objective. \r\n Furthermore, we welcome the collaboration \r\nbetween the OAU and the World Bank, as well as the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund’s technical assistance to \r\nOAU member States to strengthen their capacities for \r\nmacroeconomic management. We thank them and all \r\nour development partners for their invaluable support \r\nand contributions to African development. \r\n But the list of African problems is indeed very \r\nlong. In addition to the economic, humanitarian and \r\nsecurity problems I have referred to, Africa must deal \r\nwith the decimating onslaught of HIV/AIDS and the \r\ndevastation of malaria, among other health hazards. \r\nThe continent is truly going through its darkest hour. \r\nThis is therefore no time for ordinary solutions to \r\nAfrican problems, but an hour for extraordinary and \r\nvisionary efforts on the part of both Africans and the \r\ninternational community alike. What Africa needs is \r\nnothing short of a Marshall Plan. \r\n We believe that cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the OAU must strive to achieve that \r\nobjective. We view cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the OAU as an important partnership with \r\n \r\n 29 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nfar-reaching benefits. At the OAU summit held in \r\nAlgeria in 1999, African heads of State adopted a \r\nDeclaration that, among other things, stated: \r\n   “While expressing satisfaction at the \r\nvarious cooperation initiatives and approaches in \r\nfavour of Africa, we reaffirm our readiness and \r\nwillingness to promote, with all our partners, a \r\ngenuine partnership devoid of any selfish \r\ncalculations for influence; a partnership that \r\nrespects the unity of the continent and aims at \r\nthe development of Africa, rather than using it as \r\na mere reservoir of raw materials and a market \r\nfor manufactured goods; a partnership that \r\nenables Africa to achieve its integration, ensure \r\nits development for the benefit of its peoples and \r\noccupy its rightful place on the international \r\nscene for the mutual and inclusive benefit of the \r\ninternational community as a whole.” (A/54/424, \r\nannex II) \r\n At this point I would like to paraphrase two of the \r\nkey themes mentioned by the Foreign Minister of \r\nNamibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on the occasion of the \r\ngeneral debate this year: without the demonstration of \r\nenlightened self-interest by our development partners \r\nin embracing the idea of a Marshall Plan for Africa, all \r\nour efforts will not make the required drastic impact on \r\nthe situation in Africa; without a serious consideration \r\nof the proposition for compensation and reparations to \r\nAfrica for injustices done in the past, justice will not be \r\nserved and that chapter of our history will remain open. \r\nThis is the time for reconciliation based on courage, \r\nsolidarity and justice. Namibia trusts that cooperation \r\nbetween the OAU and the United Nations will continue \r\nto be premised upon, and promote, these virtues. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2011 (XX), of 11 October \r\n1965, I now call on the observer for the Organization \r\nof African Unity to make a statement. \r\n Mr. Kebe (Organization of African Unity) (spoke \r\nin French): First of all, on behalf of the Organization \r\nof African Unity (OAU), I would like to extend to the \r\nPresident my warmest congratulations on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly. I would \r\nalso like to thank everyone who spoke before me to \r\nsupport the efforts made by the OAU and the United \r\nNations to establish a dynamic cooperation within the \r\nframework of an exemplary and mutually beneficial \r\npartnership. In particular, I would like to mention the \r\nrepresentative and current Chairman of the OAU, the \r\nAmbassador of Togo. \r\n My thanks, of course, go also to the Secretariat of \r\nthe United Nations for its tireless efforts to raise \r\ncooperation between our two organizations to an ever \r\nhigher level. Last year, we described that cooperation \r\nas exemplary; today I strongly reiterate the satisfaction \r\nof the OAU with that cooperation, and the great \r\nimportance it attaches to it. \r\n I want to express my satisfaction at the return of \r\nSomalia to the comity of nations after an absence of \r\nmore than a decade. I urge all States members of our \r\norganizations to help sustain the momentum generated by \r\nthe meeting held at Arta, Djibouti. Further, I urge Somali \r\nleaders to pursue their endeavours towards national \r\nreconciliation and the rebuilding of State structures. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/55/498) \r\ndescribes precisely and in detail the achievements of \r\nthe United Nations and of the OAU over the past year. \r\nTwice-yearly meetings between the two Secretaries-\r\nGeneral make it possible to define overall direction and \r\nto reaffirm the principles and purposes that guide our \r\ncooperation. Consultations held periodically at New \r\nYork and at Addis Ababa and joint work in the field \r\nhave enabled our two teams to carry out the directives \r\nof our leadership and the recommendations set out in \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly. \r\n Let me observe here that today’s debate takes \r\nplace following the thirty-sixth session of the \r\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the \r\nOAU, which was held at Lome last July. \r\n Before that, in 1999 at Algiers and at Sirte, \r\nAfrica’s heads of State or Government took important \r\ndecisions aimed at strengthening the continent’s \r\ncapacity to address the many challenges it faces, both \r\nat the continent and world levels. Among those \r\ndecisions, let me mention Africa’s firm and resolute \r\ndecision that 2000 should be a year of peace and \r\nstability in the continent. It was also decided to hasten \r\nthe process of integration in Africa through speedy \r\nimplementation of the Abuja Treaty Establishing the \r\nAfrican Economic Community. Those are two major \r\nissues for consideration and action; they are also \r\npromising areas for cooperation between the OAU and \r\nthe United Nations, and I shall therefore make some \r\nfurther comments on them. \r\n \r\n30  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\n The decision that 2000 should be a year of peace \r\nand stability in Africa reflects our determination to \r\nchange the state of affairs by making a more positive \r\nimpact on the future of our countries and our peoples. \r\nTo that end, we must turn our back on tension and \r\nconflicts, with their resultant massive flows of refugees \r\nand displaced persons, and to open the way to an era of \r\nsecurity and stability in which all of our human and \r\nmaterial resources can finally be used to build our \r\nStates, consolidate democracy and ensure economic \r\nand social development for our countries and well-\r\nbeing and improved lives for our peoples. \r\n Here I would refer to the preliminary work of the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations in his report \r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n(A/52/871). \r\n At Algiers, our heads of State or Government, in \r\nthe course of an extremely honest and open debate, \r\naddressed head-on the concerns of Africa’s partners \r\nabout democratization, good governance and respect \r\nfor human rights. The resulting decision was that \r\nleaders who had seized power by overthrowing a \r\ndemocratically elected Government would no longer be \r\naccepted in the Assembly of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment. That indicates the seriousness and \r\ndetermination of African leaders in that connection. \r\n At present, we must manage current conflicts and \r\nfind lasting solutions for them. Then, we must spare no \r\neffort to prevent the outbreak of further conflicts. That \r\nconstitutes a genuine programme, and it requires ever \r\ncloser cooperation with the United Nations. In \r\nconnection with conflict management, the OAU and \r\nAfrican subregional organizations — the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the \r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) — \r\nhave taken the initiative by bringing parties together at \r\nthe negotiating table, which has led to the signature of \r\npeace agreements. \r\n But implementing such agreements requires \r\nfinancial and material resources beyond the capacity of \r\nthose organizations. Hence the need for the United \r\nNations, and more specifically the Security Council, to \r\nstep in promptly by dispatching peacekeeping forces or \r\npeace-building missions. But the Council’s slow \r\nprocedures do not enable it to maintain the momentum \r\nof peace agreements that were negotiated under very \r\ndifficult conditions and that are thus rather fragile. It \r\nhas been necessary in mid-stream to devise ad hoc \r\nprocedures for specific situations, such as those of \r\nSomalia and of Rwanda. \r\n It is urgent that conflicts be prevented; it is \r\nalways less costly to invest in prevention. That is why \r\nwe call for greater cooperation in this sphere between \r\nthe United Nations on the one hand and the OAU and \r\nAfrican regional organizations on the other. The OAU \r\nneeds more support from the United Nations to develop \r\nan early warning system within the OAU’s Mechanism \r\nfor Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. \r\nMoreover, there is no denying that the United Nations has a \r\ngreater capacity for gathering information that it could \r\nshare with the OAU. \r\n The OAU needs to work in close cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations on how to deal with regions or \r\ncountries when everything points to the imminent \r\noutbreak of conflict. It is sometimes very difficult to \r\ndraw a distinction between prevention and \r\nintervention. \r\n Then there is the social and humanitarian field; as \r\na result of overt or latent conflicts in Africa, there is a \r\ngrowing number of refugees, displaced persons and \r\nrepatriated persons. To this we must add the effects of \r\nnatural disasters such as floods, cyclones and droughts. \r\nThis calls for greater cooperation and coordination \r\nbetween our two organizations. For the 7 million \r\nAfrican refugees, we are asking for resources \r\ncommensurate with the scale of the continent-wide \r\ndisaster, and for equal treatment vis-à-vis refugees in \r\nother continents. \r\n I cannot conclude this portion of my statement \r\nwithout mentioning the important meeting of the \r\nConference on Security, Stability, Development and \r\nCooperation in Africa, held at Abuja in May 2000. This \r\nnew process brings together, in an interdependent way, \r\nthe concepts of security, stability, development and \r\ncooperation, with a collective approach encompassing \r\nall of Africa. This is a thunderbolt in the African sky; \r\nwhile there was not a great deal of media coverage, this \r\nevent can in many respects be compared with the \r\nHelsinki process. \r\n The second important decision taken at the fourth \r\nOAU Extraordinary Summit, held at Sirte, and then \r\ncrystallized at Lome in July, was to create an African \r\nUnion in conformity with the fundamental purposes of \r\nthe charter of the OAU and with the provisions of the \r\nTreaty Establishing the African Economic Community; \r\n \r\n 31 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.53\r\nto hasten the process of implementing the Treaty \r\nEstablishing the African Economic Community; and to \r\nstrengthen and consolidate the regional economic \r\ncommunities that are the pillars of the attainment of the \r\nobjectives of the African Economic Community and of \r\nthe anticipated Union. \r\n That was a decision of fundamental importance. \r\nIt came at the end of a long process that began at Lagos \r\nin 1980, that continued at Abuja in 1991 and that \r\nculminated at Tripoli in 1999, then to be given concrete \r\nform at Lome in 2000. If Africa wants to count in the \r\ncentury of globalization and play its part in the \r\nmanagement of world affairs, it must do so united, with \r\nits constituent parts acting in solidarity, and on the \r\nbasis of true integration. That is the great challenge \r\nfacing Africa on the eve of the third millennium — the \r\nroad that it must take if it is to achieve economic and \r\nsocial development.  \r\n Africa can take up this challenge only with the \r\nhelp and support of the international community. I \r\nshould like to take this opportunity to express our \r\nprofound gratitude to the international community for \r\nthe support provided for the development process in \r\nAfrica through initiatives at national, subregional and \r\ncontinent-wide levels. \r\n Despite all of this support, poverty is still the \r\nmajor problem in many countries in our continent. \r\nWhen we speak of poverty in Africa, we are talking not \r\nabout mere statistics but about real problems faced by \r\nthe poor on a daily basis. Production is at an all-time \r\nlow; income does not even come close to meeting the \r\nbasic needs of people. High rates of inflation and \r\nunemployment are widespread. Most, if not all, African \r\nGovernments have undergone structural adjustment, \r\ntaking political and social risks that have far \r\noutweighed the tangible economic benefits that have \r\nresulted.  \r\n Africa is also handicapped by widespread \r\npandemics, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. All of the \r\nconcerted efforts on the part of Africa and the \r\ninternational community are being thwarted by the \r\ndevastating effects of these two major scourges that, if \r\nnothing is done, will wipe out all the progress made in \r\neconomic and social development in the continent. The \r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General has already taken the \r\ninitiative to lead the International Partnership against \r\nHIV/AIDS in Africa, and we congratulate him on that \r\ninitiative.  \r\n At this time of globalization, when only the \r\nstrongest economies survive, Africa wants above all to \r\nbe self-reliant, delving into its resources and its \r\nimagination to come up with initiatives that will save \r\nit. But it will need international solidarity if it is to \r\nsucceed in its task. Such solidarity should, first of all, \r\nbe demonstrated in the case of the foreign debt, which \r\nwas assessed at about $220 billion in 1997. Debt \r\nservicing consumes all of the resources that would go \r\ntowards development plans for the continent. That is \r\nwhy the OAU is calling on its partners to consider the \r\nbest means of simply cancelling the entire debt, \r\nthereby making available significant resources for the \r\neconomic recovery of the continent. We appeal to the \r\nsolidarity of our partners to help to find a definitive \r\nsolution to the problem and call for an increased \r\nnumber of new and additional resources to supplement \r\ndirect foreign investment and make African countries \r\nmore competitive. It is in our partners’ interests to deal \r\nwith an Africa whose economy has recovered, an \r\nAfrica that is strong, stable and in control of its own \r\ndestiny. \r\n The concept of the global village has never meant \r\nso much as it means today. Globalization is \r\ncharacterized by the interrelationship between the \r\nmeans of communication and knowledge, cultural \r\ncrossover and economic interdependence. Distances \r\nare shrinking, differences and peculiarities are being \r\nreduced and people are being brought closer together, \r\nthereby ushering in a new humanism — the humanism \r\nof the twenty-first century. Such is the state of the \r\nworld today, as conveyed by the Declaration of the \r\nMillennium Summit that was recently held here. But \r\nthat vision of the world seems to me to be far from the \r\nvision of most people, who still think in terms of \r\ndifferent countries and continents. They should rather \r\nbe thinking about a global village, with its underlying \r\nfoundation and value of solidarity. We must make this \r\nqualitative leap forward if in the future we are to avoid \r\nsuch disasters as those that brought bloodshed to the \r\nfirst half of this century and continuing tension to the \r\nsecond half. \r\n The United Nations and the OAU now fully \r\nunderstand these new challenges and I am happy to \r\nsay, here today, that they are now striving to make \r\npeople and institutions ready to live the good life in the \r\nvillage of the twenty-first century. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. I should like to \r\n \r\n32  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.53  \r\ninform members that a draft resolution under this item \r\nwill be submitted at a later date. \r\n I should also like to inform members that the \r\nremaining two items on the agenda for this morning, \r\nnamely, agenda item 23, “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Caribbean Community”, and \r\n \r\n agenda item 36, “Bethlehem 2000”, will be taken up \r\nthis afternoon promptly at 3 p.m. \r\n Before adjourning the meeting, I would like to \r\nexpress gratitude to our interpreters for their special \r\neffort today. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
