(Finland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 26 \r\n \r\n \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union \r\n \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/55/409) \r\n \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/55/L.20) \r\n  \r\n The President: I call on the representative of \r\nIndia to introduce draft resolution A/55/L.20. \r\n Mr. Sharma (India): I have the honour of \r\nintroducing the draft resolution contained in document \r\nA/55/L.20 entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union”. The text \r\nof the draft resolution has been jointly prepared by \r\nmembers of the Executive Committee of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU) itself, and I hope that it can \r\nbe adopted by consensus, as in previous years, \r\nespecially at this juncture, when we constantly seek to \r\nimbue our work with that much sought after element, \r\npolitical will, which obviously resides in parliaments. \r\n The report prepared by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/55/409) highlights the intensification of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU, in several \r\nareas of concern to the international community. Apart \r\nfrom describing the actions taken by the IPU to support \r\nand complement the work of the United Nations, it \r\n“demonstrates the potential for a greater contribution \r\nby national parliaments, through IPU, to the work of \r\nthe United Nations, and to disseminating an \r\nunderstanding of that work and ensuring the requisite \r\nfollow-up”. These sentiments are fully reciprocated by \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union, and the final declaration \r\nentitled “The parliamentary vision of international \r\ncooperation on the eve of the third millennium” \r\nadopted by consensus at the Conference of the \r\nPresiding Officers of National Parliaments, organized \r\nby the IPU in cooperation with the United Nations at \r\nNew York from 30 August to 1 September 2000, \r\npledged the commitment of the speakers and presiding \r\nofficers to “international cooperation with a stronger \r\nUnited Nations at its core”. The Millennium \r\nDeclaration adopted by our heads of States and \r\nGovernment also identified the need to further \r\nstrengthen cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nnational parliaments through their world organization, \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union, in various fields, \r\nincluding peace and security, economic and social \r\ndevelopment, international law and human rights and \r\ndemocracy and gender issues. We, therefore, fully \r\nshare the Secretary General’s hope that “the \r\nincreasingly close and productive relationship between \r\nthe United Nations and the IPU may soon also be \r\nrecognized through a new, strengthened and formalized \r\nrelationship between IPU and the General Assembly”. \r\n Substantially, the concerns of the United Nations \r\nand the IPU are common: equitable economic growth, \r\nthe achievement of international peace and security, \r\ndemocracy, respect for human rights, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and social progress. There is an essential \r\nsimilarity in approach, convergence of actions and, \r\n \r\n2  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\nmost importantly, a congruence of the objectives of the \r\ntwo organizations. It is for this reason that the draft \r\nresolution in its preambular part, having recalled \r\nresolution 54/12 of 27 October, 1999, and having \r\nconsidered the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/55/409), notes with appreciation the resolutions \r\nadopted and the activities carried out by the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union during the past year in support of \r\nthe United Nations. It furthermore welcomes the \r\nunanimous adoption of the Declaration “The \r\nparliamentary vision of international cooperation on \r\nthe eve of the third millennium” at the Conference of \r\nthe Presiding Officers of National Parliaments and \r\nrecalls with satisfaction the United Nations Millennium \r\nDeclaration, which contains the resolve of the Member \r\nStates to further strengthen cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and national parliaments through their \r\nworld organization, the Inter-Parliamentary Union. It \r\nalso recalls the unique inter-State character of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union. In its operative part, the \r\nresolution welcomes the efforts of the IPU to provide \r\nfor greater parliamentary contribution and enhanced \r\nsupport to the United Nations and calls for further \r\nconsolidation of cooperation between the two \r\norganizations. The second paragraph, as originally \r\ndrafted, requested the Secretary-General, in the true \r\nspirit of transparency and openness characterizing all \r\ndemocracies, to explore ways, in consultation with \r\nMember States and the IPU, in which a new and \r\nformalized relationship, as recommended by the \r\nSecretary-General, might be established between the \r\nIPU, the General Assembly and its subsidiary organs, \r\nand to report thereon to the General Assembly by May \r\nnext year. However, in order to achieve consensus on \r\nthe text, it has been decided to change one word in \r\nparagraph 2, namely, the word “formalized”, which \r\nwould be replaced by the word “strengthened”. In \r\nparagraph 3, the draft resolution requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit a report to the General Assembly at \r\nits fifty-sixth session on various aspects of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union and the last paragraph decides to \r\ninclude the item entitled “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union” in \r\nthe provisional agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n In conclusion, given the fact that the draft \r\nresolution that I have just introduced has no financial \r\nimplications for the programme budget, and in view of \r\nthe resolve of our heads of State and Government \r\nexpressed at the Millennium Summit, as well as the \r\ndesire of speakers and presiding officers of national \r\nparliaments to strengthen cooperation between the IPU \r\nand the United Nations, I wish to propose on behalf of \r\nall the sponsors that the draft resolution be adopted by \r\nconsensus. \r\n I should like to announce that, since the \r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following \r\nadditional countries have become sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, \r\nBolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, \r\nChina, Costa Rica, Cuba, Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, \r\nFinland, Gabon, Germany, Guatemala, Guyana, \r\nHungary, Ireland, Japan, Jordan, Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMalaysia, Mauritania, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, \r\nParaguay, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, \r\nRomania, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri \r\nLanka, Sudan, Surinam, Sweden, Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela and \r\nYugoslavia. \r\n Mr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus is grateful to the \r\nPermanent Representative of India for introducing the \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union”. \r\n We also welcome the Secretary-General of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and thank him for the \r\ncoordination of the work between the United Nations \r\nand the Union. \r\n The Republic of Belarus attaches great \r\nimportance to the problems of cooperation between the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union and the United Nations. In \r\nthis context, this past year has been particularly \r\nimportant. The unprecedented number of leaders of \r\nnational legislative organs that took part in the \r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, which preceded the United Nations \r\nMillennium Summit. This remarkable event helped \r\ncreate the important background for fruitful discussion \r\nduring the Millennium Summit. Both the Conference \r\nand the Summit demonstrated to the international \r\ncommunity the unanimity of the legislative and \r\nexecutive power of the United Nations Member States \r\non the most important aspects of the international \r\nagenda. The heads of both Chambers of the National \r\n \r\n 3 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\nAssembly of the Republic of Belarus who took part in \r\nthe Conference made their contribution to the process \r\nby creating this unanimity. I have been instructed by \r\nthe National Assembly to reassure the Members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly that the members of the Parliament \r\nof the Republic of Belarus are ready to continue their \r\nwork in close cooperation with the United Nations in \r\norder to implement the final decisions of the \r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments and the Millennium Summit. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (A/55/409) makes it clear that the \r\nfields of interaction of both important bodies are \r\nconstantly broadening. The Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\nis becoming a more active partner of the United \r\nNations in all its activities and undertakings and \r\nimplements many of United Nations initiatives at the \r\nlevel of national parliaments. We believe this to be a \r\nvery significant aspect of the IPU’s work. \r\nStrengthening of the United Nations initiatives at the \r\nlevel of national legislative bodies means taking \r\npractical steps which provide greater effectiveness for \r\nsuch work. We welcome new elements in this year’s \r\nresolution related to further improvement of \r\ncooperation between the IPU and the General \r\nAssembly, as well as the proposal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral concerning formalization of the relationship \r\nbetween two unique forums in the international \r\nrelations system. \r\n This year is of particular significance for further \r\ndevelopment of parliamentarianism in Belarus. There \r\nwere the first ever large-scale elections to the Lower \r\nHouse of the National Assembly of the Republic of \r\nBelarus. The electoral campaign was preceded by \r\nenormous work by all Belarusian political institutions. \r\nThe result of this work was the adoption of the \r\nElectoral Code of the Republic of Belarus that \r\naccumulated most of the experience of the advanced \r\nparliamentary democracies of the world. \r\n The elections were monitored by around 200 \r\nindependent international observers, representing over \r\n20 countries of the world. Two rounds of elections led \r\nto the formation of a new legal body of representative \r\npower that will start its work on 21 November. \r\n The new Belarusian Parliament will certainly be \r\nan active participant in all activities of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. \r\n The Republic of Belarus is convinced that \r\ninteraction and growing cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the IPU will serve the benefit of \r\nthe people of our States. We see a high meaning and \r\nthe necessity to continue intensive work in this field \r\nand will do our best to encourage its progress. \r\n Mr. Hρnningstad (Norway): Let me at the outset \r\nthank the Permanent Representative of India for his \r\nexcellent introduction to the draft resolution before us. \r\n Two major events have taken place here at the \r\nUnited Nations this autumn that have contributed \r\ngreatly to ensuring closer cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and parliamentarians in the years to \r\ncome. I am referring to the Conference of Presiding \r\nOfficers of the National Parliaments and the \r\nMillennium Summit. We should all heed the clear \r\nmessage that was conveyed by the presiding officers of \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) when they called \r\nfor more active participation of parliamentarians in \r\ninternational cooperation. The Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union (A/55/409) shows that \r\nthis cooperation has been consolidated and diversified \r\nduring the past year. \r\n National parliaments are comprised of men and \r\nwomen who have been elected precisely for the \r\npurpose of representing the people. Parliaments have a \r\nlegitimate role to play in making the voice of the \r\npeople heard in international decision-making \r\nprocesses. They can and should give a parliamentary \r\ndimension to international cooperation. Moreover, \r\nincreased interaction between national parliaments and \r\nmultilateral institutions, including the United Nations, \r\ncould bring even more transparency and accountability \r\nto these institutions and enhance their ability to \r\nimplement policies and programmes that have been \r\nagreed. Governments need support in national \r\nparliaments to be effective on the international scene. \r\n It is therefore encouraging that the presiding \r\nofficers so firmly pledged their commitment to \r\ncontribute to international cooperation in the future. \r\nWe need to develop better mechanisms for dialogue \r\nbetween the grass-roots level and international \r\norganizations. Non-governmental organizations have a \r\nrole to play in cooperation with the United Nations. \r\nBut fundamentally the world needs a United Nations \r\nwhere citizens feel that they are genuinely represented \r\n \r\n4  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\nin their political diversity. The United Nations must \r\nhave a parliamentary dimension. \r\n The Nordic countries have chosen to include \r\nparliamentarians representing different parties in their \r\ndelegations to the General Assembly and to special \r\nconferences. I would recommend this as a general \r\nmodel, as one element in building a parliamentary \r\ndimension. The United Nations would also benefit \r\nfrom drawing more heavily on the political expertise of \r\nthese parliamentarians in connection with the General \r\nAssembly and other meetings. \r\n In the Millennium Declaration the Member States \r\nresolved to further strengthen cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the national parliaments through \r\ntheir world organization, the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion. This accentuates the need to give the IPU a new \r\nand formalized status vis-à-vis the General Assembly \r\nand its subsidiary organs which is commensurate with \r\nits current membership and activities. The United \r\nNations should not consider the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion as a non-governmental organization. \r\n In this context, we appreciate the views of the \r\nSecretary-General as expressed in paragraph 64 of his \r\nreport. We therefore strongly support the draft \r\nresolution before us, particularly the request to the \r\nSecretary-General to explore ways in which a new and \r\nformalized relationship may be established, and to \r\nreport back to the General Assembly when it resumes \r\nsession in May 2001. As a co-sponsor, Norway is \r\nconfident that the General Assembly will adopt the \r\nresolution by consensus. \r\n Mr. Udovenko (Ukraine): It is a special pleasure \r\nfor me, who once was honoured to be the President of \r\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly, to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on the assumption of \r\nthis highly authoritative post. I am convinced that \r\nunder your skilful guidance and leadership, the \r\nAssembly will be able to achieve important results. My \r\ndelegation wishes you every success in this endeavour. \r\n I am especially gratified to participate in this \r\ndebate on cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). Having become a \r\nmember of the IPU, Ukraine has co-sponsored the draft \r\nresolution under this agenda item in the strong \r\nconviction that the two organizations have a joint \r\nmission to make prosperity, peace and democracy the \r\nreal universal values of the next century. My delegation \r\nis grateful to the Permanent Representative of India for \r\nhis introduction of the draft resolution, of which \r\nUkraine is a sponsor and which I hope will be adopted \r\nby consensus. \r\n In carrying out its mandate, the IPU has clearly \r\ndemonstrated that it shares the lofty goals of the United \r\nNations. The IPU helps in a significant way to \r\nintensify the dialogue among societies and nations on \r\nthe pressing issues of international peace and security, \r\nhuman rights, the environment and economic and \r\nsocial development, thereby fully contributing to the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations.  \r\n We are convinced that the Conference of \r\nPresiding Officers of National Parliaments, which was \r\nheld recently in New York in conjunction with the \r\nMillennium Assembly, has become a milestone in the \r\nhistory of cooperation between our two organizations \r\nand has contributed significantly to shaping awareness \r\namong elected members of national parliaments of the \r\nglobal challenges the United Nations is facing at the \r\ndawn of the third millennium. It has also provided an \r\nopportunity to enhance public understanding of the \r\nactivities of the United Nations and to gain stronger \r\nsupport for the Organization. \r\n It would not be an overstatement to say that \r\njoining the IPU had particular significance for Ukraine. \r\nHaving embarked on the road to true democratic \r\ntransformation of its society, the intensive contacts and \r\ncontinuous exchange of experiences among \r\nparliamentarians of all countries within the framework \r\nof the IPU is of major importance to us. A lot has been \r\nachieved in a short time to ensure that the process of \r\nreform in the political and economic spheres taking \r\nplace in my country gains momentum and becomes \r\nirreversible. The rule of law and the supremacy of the \r\nConstitution have become the guiding principles of \r\npolitical reality. Presidential and parliamentary \r\nelections have been conducted in a democratic fashion. \r\nCivil peace and public accord have been maintained, \r\nthereby strengthening the foundations of civil society. \r\n Last February’s formation of a democratic \r\nmajority in the Ukrainian Parliament contributed \r\nsignificantly to an atmosphere of political stability in \r\nthe country, thus creating a favourable environment for \r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the law-making process. \r\nThereafter, it became possible to proceed speedily to \r\nadopt laws, of crucial importance for the strengthening \r\nof our independent statehood, that had previously been \r\nunreasonably delayed. In particular, taxation, civil and \r\n \r\n 5 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\nadministrative codes have been successfully adopted. \r\nThe passing of the land code was an event whose \r\nimportance can hardly be overestimated. The agrarian \r\nreform, which is based on the principles of private \r\nproperty, provides that industrious Ukrainian peasants \r\nwill become real owners of their land. \r\n In the coming century, the observance of the \r\nprinciples of human rights, the rights of national \r\nminorities and the realization of social justice will \r\ndominate people’s lives. Without them there will be no \r\ncivility in societies; there will be no peace. Moreover, \r\nthey will drive economic and social progress. During \r\nthe years since its independence, Ukraine — a multi-\r\nethnic country with over 130 ethnic minorities — \r\nsuccessfully managed to avoid inter-ethnic conflicts \r\nand to preserve peace and internal stability. That was \r\nmade possible due to the persistent efforts of the \r\nGovernment and Parliament of Ukraine to pursue a \r\npolicy based on full respect for the rights of national \r\nminorities through the support of detailed national \r\nlegislation consistent with international norms and \r\nstandards in the field of national minority rights. This \r\nhas received high praise from the Council of Europe \r\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (OSCE). \r\n Let me also recall the decision of the President of \r\nUkraine to put forth the candidacy of Ukraine’s former \r\nForeign Minister, Mr. Borys Tarasyuk, for the post of \r\nOSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities. We \r\nhope his candidacy will enjoy overwhelming support \r\nduring the elections that will be held shortly, at the \r\nnext OSCE ministerial meeting in Vienna. \r\n In conclusion, Ukraine would like to reiterate its \r\nsatisfaction at seeing stronger cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the IPU. It is our hope that this \r\ncooperation will be further enhanced in the years to \r\ncome. For its part, Ukraine will spare no effort to \r\ncontribute to the achievement of that important goal. \r\n Mr. Levitte (France) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. \r\nThe countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated \r\nwith the European Union — Bulgaria, the Czech \r\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, \r\nRomania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the associated \r\ncountries of Cyprus, Malta and Turkey align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is of long standing. In \r\nfact, in 1947 the IPU was among the first organizations \r\nto obtain general consultative status with the Economic \r\nand Social Council. As the Ambassador of India \r\npointed out in his excellent introduction of the draft \r\nresolution before us today, that privileged relationship \r\ngained renewed strength in 1996 when the cooperation \r\nagreement between the IPU and the United Nations \r\nwas concluded. \r\n This item was first inscribed on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. Since that \r\ntime, this item has annually been the subject of a \r\nplenary debate during consideration of the relevant \r\ndraft resolutions. This illustrates the importance \r\nattached by Member States to the draft resolutions, as \r\ndoes their adoption by consensus every year. \r\n The European Union is pleased at recent \r\ndevelopments aimed at involving our parliaments even \r\nmore closely in the activities of the United Nations. In \r\nrecent months, the international community has \r\nsolemnly and at the highest level reaffirmed its wish to \r\nsee the role of parliaments in international life more \r\nclearly confirmed. That desire was clearly expressed by \r\nthe elected officials of the people themselves during \r\nthe Conference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, organized by the IPU at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters from 30 August to 1 September 2001. \r\n That same message was forcefully recalled in the \r\nMillennium Declaration adopted on 8 September 2000. \r\nOn that occasion, heads of State or Government \r\ndecided \r\n “To strengthen further cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and national parliaments through \r\ntheir world organization, the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion, in various fields, including peace and \r\nsecurity, economic and social development, \r\ninternational law and human rights and \r\ndemocracy and gender issues.” (resolution 55/2, \r\npara. 30) \r\n In the spirit of those messages, delivered by the \r\nhighest authorities of our countries, the European \r\nUnion seeks full recognition of the contribution of \r\nparliamentary diplomacy to the attainment of the \r\npurposes of the United Nations. \r\n The unanimous adoption by presiding officers of \r\nnational parliaments of a declaration entitled “The \r\nParliamentary vision of international cooperation on \r\nthe eve of the third millennium” was surely one of the \r\n \r\n6  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\nhigh points of the Millennium Assembly. It confirmed \r\nthe international role that national parliaments can play \r\nin bringing peoples closer together and thus in building \r\na more peaceful, more democratic and more prosperous \r\nworld. It confirms for the future that the voice of \r\nparliamentarians can and must be heard within the \r\ncomity of nations. The European Union has joined in \r\nsponsoring draft resolution A/55/L.20 because it is \r\nconvinced that it will let the voices of parliamentarians \r\nfrom all countries be heard more clearly. \r\n By calling for a new and strengthened \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, the General Assembly will show \r\nits commitment to opening the United Nations up to \r\nthe peoples themselves, to public opinion and to \r\ninternational civil society. That effort at openness is in \r\nline with the most recent initiatives that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has taken throughout the Millennium \r\nAssembly. I take this opportunity, on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union, to welcome those initiatives. \r\nUltimately, this effort should yield an imaginative, bold \r\ncollective effort to let the oldest of international \r\npolitical institutions take its rightful place within the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Mr. Schloten (Germany): It is indeed an \r\nimportant event for me, as Chairman of the Group of \r\nTwelve Plus in the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), \r\nencompassing 43 member countries and two \r\nparliamentary assemblies, to address this audience in \r\norder to underline the importance of new cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. This important issue has been \r\ndealt with by the Assembly in previous years. \r\nRepresentatives of many countries have pointed out \r\nthat parliamentarians worldwide and in the IPU have a \r\nstronger role to play than ever before. \r\n Many a presiding officer or parliamentarian \r\npresent at the millennium Conference of Presiding \r\nOfficers of National Parliaments, held recently in New \r\nYork, was particularly pleased to listen to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, \r\nand to the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nfifty-fourth session, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, when they \r\naddressed that conference. When the Secretary-General \r\nsaid that no group of leaders was better placed to \r\nexpress the interests of their citizens in a global era \r\nthan heads of parliaments, who represent the peoples of \r\nthe world, he strongly underlined the increasing weight \r\nof parliaments in today’s globalized world. \r\n The Secretary-General’s view that the voice of \r\nparliaments must be heard and that, if democracy is to \r\nthrive at the global level, the peoples of the world must \r\nrise above their differences and unite to pursue the \r\ncommon interests of all humankind needs our full \r\nsupport. His observation that a parliamentary vision of \r\ninternational relations is needed more than ever before \r\nmeans that the United Nations needs a parliamentary \r\ndimension, a parliamentary element and parliamentary \r\nsupport for all its efforts. That parliamentary \r\ndimension can and must be provided by the only \r\nworldwide international parliamentary organization, \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union, which was founded in \r\n1889. \r\n The address of the President of the fifty-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly to the Conference of \r\nPresiding Officers underlined the fact that the IPU and \r\nthe United Nations now have to find new ways to work \r\ntogether beyond mere cooperation; they must strive for \r\nstrong bonds of mutual interaction on common ground. \r\n The fourth part of the Declaration unanimously \r\nadopted by the presiding officers of parliaments, \r\nentitled “The parliamentary vision of international \r\ncooperation on the eve of the third millennium”, \r\nexplicitly deals with the parliamentary dimension of \r\ninternational cooperation. All parliaments of the world \r\nand their organization, the IPU, are called upon to \r\nprovide a parliamentary dimension for international \r\ncooperation. This call should be understood not only as \r\na challenge to implement a programme. It must go \r\nmuch further: it has to be understood as a continuous \r\neffort to bring together the United Nations and the IPU. \r\nThat means providing the United Nations with a \r\nspecific parliamentary body with the task of supporting \r\nthe United Nations in implementing democracy and \r\nStates based on the rule of law on a worldwide scale, \r\nand in making the implementation of programmes \r\nmore feasible. \r\n Closer cooperation and mutual interaction on the \r\npart of the two international bodies, the IPU and the \r\nUnited Nations, would be far more apt and capable in \r\nterms of strengthening mechanisms for democratic \r\ncontrol and legitimization of the United Nations than \r\neither organization trying to achieve that goal on its \r\nown. If, in that context, the IPU can act as the \r\nparliamentary dimension or arm of the United Nations, \r\nthe operational ability of the United Nations in today’s \r\nworld would stand on even more solid ground. \r\n \r\n 7 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\n With regard to today’s meeting of the General \r\nAssembly, the Group of Twelve Plus in the IPU has \r\nthoroughly discussed the context of the draft resolution \r\non which a decision will be taken here. All members \r\nwere strongly in favour of requesting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in consultation with Member States and with \r\nthe IPU, to explore ways in which a new and \r\nstrengthened relationship might be established between \r\nthe IPU and the General Assembly and its subsidiary \r\norgans. \r\n We are ready and willing to make our \r\ncontribution regarding what such a relationship should \r\nlook like. I am aware that the IPU will not be the \r\n“parliament of the United Nations”. Although I would \r\nbe in favour of having a parliamentary assembly of the \r\nUnited Nations, like the Parliamentary Assembly of the \r\nCouncil of Europe, I realize that political and legal \r\nconstraints would impede such a vision. However, we \r\nhave to be clear about how such a parliamentary \r\ndimension or component could be accepted by the \r\nUnited Nations and about how it could function. I wish \r\nto avoid speaking of two independent world \r\norganizations existing side by side. \r\n Therefore, we should try to bring the United \r\nNations and the IPU closer together, which would \r\nmean scheduling joint conferences, bringing \r\nparliamentarians, General Assembly members and \r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations together in a \r\npermanent dialogue through meetings and sessions at \r\nthe United Nations in order continuously to exchange \r\nthe views needed to strengthen democracy, States \r\nbased on the rule of law and common values all over \r\nthe world. \r\n Recent developments have clearly shown that the \r\ncontribution of parliaments in working together with \r\nthe United Nations needs to be improved and can be \r\nreinforced. As the Secretary-General has said, the voice \r\nof parliamentarians should be heard worldwide. We \r\nmust arrive at the conviction that the goals we are \r\nstriving for can be better achieved when the IPU and \r\nthe United Nations continuously work hand in hand. \r\nThe 43 countries members of the Twelve Plus \r\nGroup — the democracies based upon the rule of \r\nlaw — offer their good services to help create stability \r\nin an increasingly complicated world. \r\n I sincerely invite all members present to vote in \r\nfavour of the draft resolution. A positive vote would be \r\na first step for deeper and closer cooperation linking \r\nthe two organizations to create one system for the good \r\nof the people. \r\n Mr. Ka (Senegal) (spoke in French): The annual \r\nconsideration by the General Assembly of the state of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union testifies to the very special \r\ninterest that the international community accords to the \r\ntwo organizations, which collaborate in various areas \r\nof activity, within the agreed framework of a mutually \r\nadvantageous partnership. \r\n Before continuing with my statement, I should \r\nlike to pay tribute to and welcome my friend, President \r\nUdovenko, parliamentarian from Ukraine, and, above \r\nall, to congratulate him for his inspiring statement. \r\n I am particularly pleased to note the holding, \r\nfrom 30 August to 1 September 2000, of the \r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, held in conjunction with the Millennium \r\nAssembly. By holding that Conference at United \r\nNations Headquarters so as to express to the United \r\nNations the significant support that national assemblies \r\nnow intend to give to international cooperation, the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union performed a historic act, \r\ntaking a step towards a new partnership. This new \r\npartnership — for such it is — is aimed at key, \r\nsensitive areas of international relations, such as peace \r\nand security, economic and social development and the \r\npromotion of human rights and human solidarity \r\nworldwide. \r\n Speaking in the debate at that historic \r\nConference, Mr. Cheikh Abdoul Khadre Cissokho, \r\nPresident of the National Assembly of Senegal, stated, \r\nwith great relevance: \r\n  “Parliaments are the authentic voice of \r\npeoples because they issue from peoples, as well \r\nas being the expression of sovereign will. A \r\nglobal parliament could make a decisive \r\ncontribution to the balance of the planet, the firm \r\nestablishment of peace, economic and social \r\nprogress and the primacy of the human person for \r\nthe benefit of the Governments represented in the \r\ncommunity of nations.” \r\n My delegation believes that such objectives must \r\ntoday constitute the bedrock on which cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union should rest. The priority \r\nobjectives which the United Nations and the Inter-\r\n \r\n8  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\nParliamentary Union must address today include the \r\nneed to foster the development of poor countries, with \r\nthe two organizations always working together to \r\nensure that globalization, which has become an \r\ninevitable fact, is fair and able to respond appropriately \r\nto the aspirations and interests of our peoples. \r\n During its October 1999 session in Berlin, the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Council debated the need for a \r\ndetailed review of the international financial structures \r\nand called for special initiatives to be undertaken to \r\nhelp the countries of the South, so as to take account of \r\nthe concerns of the great part of humankind that does \r\nnot enjoy the benefits of globalization. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General also allows \r\nus to measure the scope and diversity of the \r\ncooperation between the Inter-Parliamentary Union and \r\nthe United Nations. Thus, during the past year the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union has continued to consider \r\nissues relating to disarmament, peace and international \r\nsecurity, the dialogue between civilizations and \r\ncultures, the question of the Middle East, economic \r\nand social development, the environment, democracy, \r\ngood governance and equality between men and \r\nwomen.  \r\n In the field of disarmament and peace, my \r\ncountry has noted with satisfaction that at the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Conference held in Amman in April and \r\nMay 2000, the Inter-Parliamentary Union reaffirmed its \r\nsupport for the disarmament efforts of the United \r\nNations by asking the member parliaments to \r\nencourage all countries to sign and ratify the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the \r\nOttawa Convention on anti-personnel landmines. At \r\nthat Conference, the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\nwelcomed the proclamation by the General Assembly \r\nof 2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among \r\nCivilizations, and decided to make a contribution to the \r\nsuccess of this commendable initiative. \r\n On the question of the Middle East, I, personally, \r\nin my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, should like to testify to the remarkable \r\nparticipation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the \r\nHanoi meeting in January 2000, during which the \r\nUnion reaffirmed its support for the peace process \r\nthrough dialogue among the parliamentary delegations \r\nof the Asian region. In February 1999 in Rome, the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union also made a remarkable \r\ncontribution to the conference to promote the \r\nBethlehem 2000 project, launched by the Palestinian \r\nAuthority and supported by the Committee. \r\n This list, which is not exhaustive, not only \r\ndemonstrates the vigour of the cooperation that exists \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, but illustrates how their activities \r\nconverge and how the purposes and aims of the two \r\norganizations are perfectly compatible. \r\n I should like to conclude by stressing that in \r\norder to function as smoothly as possible, our world \r\nneeds governments and parliaments that are united \r\naround common values and shared ideals to work \r\ntogether for a single cause — that of the primacy of the \r\nhuman person, of law, of justice and of economic, \r\nsocial and cultural progress. That is the full meaning of \r\nthe beneficial cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and that is also why \r\nmy delegation supports the draft resolution which my \r\nfriend, the Ambassador of India, eloquently introduced, \r\nand hopes that it will obtain general support. \r\n Mr. Widodo (Indonesia): It is a privilege for the \r\nIndonesian delegation to speak on the agenda item \r\nbefore us. Before proceeding further, I would like to \r\navail myself of this opportunity to convey to \r\nrepresentatives the importance that we attach to \r\nenhanced cooperation between the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion and the United Nations, which, in our view, \r\nshould become an important norm in the new \r\nmillennium. Such cooperation is essential for an \r\neffective, vibrant and reformed United Nations that is \r\nresponsive to the concerns and interests of the vast \r\nmajority of its Member States, the developing \r\ncountries. \r\n The Conference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, held in New York in conjunction with the \r\nMillennium Assembly of the United Nations, with the \r\nparticipation of 150 presiding officers from 138 \r\ncountries and 1,000 delegates, was a significant event \r\nin increasing parliamentary contribution to \r\ninternational relations in general and to the promotion \r\nof the Organization’s objectives in particular. It also \r\nserved the dual purpose of generating greater \r\nunderstanding of the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations by the parliamentarians while allowing \r\nthe United Nations to hear the views of \r\nparliamentarians on substantive issues considered by \r\nthe Member States. It gives us great pleasure to note \r\n \r\n 9 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\nthat Indonesian parliamentarians, led by the Speaker of \r\nParliament, Mr. Akbar Tandjung, also took part in the \r\nConference and made substantial contributions. \r\n The convening of the one hundred and fourth \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Jakarta last \r\nmonth was another important milestone in the \r\nsustained efforts of the Union to make substantive \r\ncontributions in furthering international cooperation. In \r\nadopting a series of resolutions on issues of global \r\nconcern and interest, it called for the maintenance of \r\nconstitutional democracy as an essential prerequisite to \r\nensure human rights; the participation of all sectors of \r\nsociety, including women and minorities and other \r\nvulnerable segments, in democratic processes; renewed \r\ncommitment to dialogue and negotiations in the \r\nsettlement of internal disputes and divisions; and the \r\npromotion of a culture of democracy, good governance \r\nand democratic rights of citizens. \r\n In the economic sphere, the Conference called on \r\nboth developed and developing nations to pursue \r\ndevelopment with a human face and to launch new \r\napproaches to sustainable development in the context \r\nof globalization in order to ensure economic growth, \r\nsocial development and environmental protection. Our \r\ndelegation would like to avail itself of this opportunity \r\nto express our gratitude to the parliamentary \r\ndelegations that attended the Conference and made it a \r\nsuccess. \r\n It is in the face of these hard realities that \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union has become imperative. In this \r\ncontext, it is gratifying to note from the report of the \r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/55/409 \r\nthat during the past year, the two organizations \r\nundertook mutually reinforcing actions on various \r\nissues. Specific areas have been identified in the \r\nreport, especially on cooperation for the promotion of \r\npeace and security, democracy and good governance, \r\nand social and economic development. These constitute \r\nthe foundations for ensuring the security of all States; \r\nfor the settlement of disputes and conflicts by peaceful \r\nmeans; and for creating an equitable international \r\neconomic system that would lead to the eradication of \r\nhunger, poverty, illiteracy and disease. \r\n Development as a continuing process is an \r\nessential prerequisite for peace. Both these objectives \r\nmust be pursued together. It is the primary \r\nresponsibility of the international community to adopt \r\nurgent and resolute actions in overcoming these age-\r\nold scourges of humanity. \r\n Democracy has become a global movement. \r\nThere is universal recognition that a democratic system \r\nof governance ensures the liberties of the people as \r\nwell as transparency and accountability in decision-\r\nmaking processes, and seeks lasting solutions to \r\npolitical, economic and social problems. Citizens of \r\nthese countries now have an opportunity to choose \r\ntheir own destiny. However, they need time to develop \r\nand gain maturity. In a complex and uncertain era of \r\ninterdependence and globalization, the challenge to \r\nthese States is how to consolidate their democratic \r\nachievements and expedite their socio-economic \r\nprogress in the nation-State system, in accordance with \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n In this context, the role of the United Nations in \r\nassisting these new democracies will be of great \r\nimportance. The Organization should continue to \r\ndiscuss new ideas and approaches concerning the \r\nfuture promotion of the democratic ideals put forward \r\nby these States, the academic community and civil \r\nsociety. \r\n We in Indonesia, imbued by a desire to realize the \r\nuniversal goals of common peace and generalized \r\nprosperity and to promote an international cooperation \r\nthat is just and equitable, pledge to make our \r\ncontribution, through active participation in the joint \r\nefforts of both the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, to make this world a better place, \r\nso that peoples can live in harmony. We also reaffirm \r\nour commitment to coordinate the positions of these \r\ntwo distinguished but distinct organizations on issues \r\nrelating to peace and security, and development and \r\npoverty eradication. In this way, we can make \r\nourselves heard as a single voice, with the courage and \r\nperseverance needed for a major transformation of \r\nrelations among nations. \r\n It is in this spirit that Indonesia has joined other \r\nMember States in co-sponsoring the draft resolution on \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union”, as contained in document \r\nA/55/L.20. \r\n Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nThe delegation of Burkina Faso has the honour of \r\ntaking the floor on the item “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union”. In \r\n \r\n10  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\nthis regard, we would like to recall Assembly \r\nresolution 54/1 of 27 October 1999, in which note was \r\ntaken, with satisfaction, of the resolutions adopted and \r\nthe activities carried out by the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion in support of the activities of the United Nations \r\nin various fields of importance to international life. \r\n The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is the global \r\norganization of the parliaments of sovereign States. \r\nCreated in 1889, it is the ideal forum for inter-\r\nparliamentary dialogue at the global level. The IPU’s \r\nactivities support peace and cooperation among \r\npeoples and the strengthening of representative \r\ndemocracy. To this end, the IPU supports contacts, \r\ncoordination and the exchange of experiences between \r\nthe parliaments and parliamentarians of all countries; it \r\nexamines questions of international interest and adopts \r\ndeclarations regarding them in order to urge \r\nparliaments and parliamentarians to take action; and it \r\ncontributes to greater awareness of the functioning of \r\nrepresentative institutions, as well as to strengthening \r\nand developing their means of taking action. \r\n At the dawning of the third millennium, all \r\ncivilized nations have fully recognized that \r\nrepresentative democracy and good governance are \r\nessential for the realization of development, peace and \r\nthe emancipation of peoples. This principle has \r\nproduced a great wave of democratization on all \r\ncontinents. No country can avoid this movement, and \r\nthose that try to resist it only delay the inevitable \r\noutcome imposed by the dynamics of global \r\ncivilization. Thus, the institution of parliament is \r\nplaying a more and more significant role within \r\nsocieties and in relation to the other State and \r\nrepublican institutions. The institution of parliament \r\nhas become the guarantor of democracy and human \r\nrights, the symbol of the nation and its unity, the voice \r\nof the general and national interest. \r\n On the international level, parliamentary \r\ndiplomacy has taken root and allows our various \r\nparliaments to better discuss and work to create \r\ndemocratic conditions to support social peace, security, \r\ndevelopment and international cooperation. The IPU is \r\nthe institutional expression of inter-parliamentary \r\ncooperation. Although a rather venerable institution, \r\nthe IPU is also one of the innovative institutions of \r\ninternational life. \r\n Of course Burkina Faso has not resisted this wave \r\nof democratic renewal. By means of the current \r\ninstitutions of the fourth Republic, it enjoys a relatively \r\nyoung democracy that is based on the Constitution \r\nadopted by referendum on 2 June 1991. Our \r\ndemocratic process is thus in its tenth year and on its \r\nsecond legislature. \r\n For the young Parliament of Burkina Faso, the \r\nIPU is a source of information, exchanges and support. \r\nOur Parliament systematically participates in all the \r\nmeetings of the IPU so as to strengthen its capacities \r\nand share its experiences. Given this commitment, \r\nBurkina Faso has been chosen to host the 106th IPU \r\nConference, which will be held in Ouagadougou from \r\n9 to 15 September 2001. The Conference is the \r\nprincipal statutory entity of the IPU, in whose name it \r\nestablishes global positions and orientations. The \r\nrecent Conference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments — which was held here in New York from \r\n30 August to 1 September 2000, as a prelude to the \r\nMillennium Assembly — brought together some 150 \r\npresiding officers of parliaments and close to 1,000 \r\ndelegates; Burkina Faso was chosen as its general \r\nRapporteur. This bears witness to the privileged role \r\nour country plays within the IPU in supporting that \r\ninstitution and in promoting the consolidation of the \r\ndemocratic process throughout the world. \r\n As regards cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which is \r\nthe subject of today’s discussion, Burkina Faso gives \r\nits full support to the draft resolution that is before the \r\nAssembly, and of which Burkina Faso is one of the \r\nsponsors. My delegation clearly has a great interest in \r\nthe maintenance and expansion of this cooperation. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General, entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union”, contained in document \r\nA/55/409, sets out the possible scope of this \r\ncooperation and the range of areas in which it might \r\ntake place. Moreover, the cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the IPU has already been \r\nestablished. In November 1995 the General Assembly \r\nadopted a resolution expressing its desire to strengthen \r\ncooperation with the IPU and to establish a new and \r\nsuitable framework for this cooperation. The resolution \r\nrequested the Secretary-General to take the necessary \r\nsteps to reach an agreement to this end. That \r\nagreement, signed on 24 July 1996 at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters, was concerned with several important \r\naspects of international life, including, inter alia, peace \r\nand security, economic and social development, \r\n \r\n 11 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\ninternational law and human rights, democracy, \r\ngovernance and gender issues. \r\n Generally speaking, it is parliaments that \r\nimplement international law on the domestic level. \r\nSpecifically, in relation to the United Nations, this \r\nimplementation involves the resolutions and decisions \r\nof the United Nations and the ratification of, and other \r\nforms of adherence to, United Nations treaties and \r\nconventions. It is therefore important that there be \r\nexpanded cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe IPU — one of which is the major source of \r\ninternational law and the other of which is the \r\ninstitution by which international law is adopted as \r\ndomestic law. \r\n All these considerations bear eloquent witness to \r\nthe helpful and irreplaceable role that parliaments and \r\nparliamentarians play in international relations. Given \r\nthis interaction and this relationship, it is imperative \r\nthat the cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe IPU be vigorously strengthened. In our opinion, the \r\nbest means of doing this would be to further formalize \r\nthis cooperation by following what has been done with \r\nseveral other organizations and conferring on the IPU a \r\ndefinite status. \r\n This is what Burkina Faso would like to see. We \r\ntherefore ask the Assembly to adopt by consensus the \r\ndraft resolution that is before us, which my friend \r\nAmbassador Ling so brilliantly introduced. \r\n Mr. Bulkachuwa (Nigeria): Nigeria is happy to \r\nco-sponsor the draft resolution being coordinated by \r\nIndia. \r\n We attach great importance to cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU), as our country has only \r\nrecently returned to democratic governance after many \r\nyears of military dictatorship. It is a well-known fact \r\nthat the first victim of any forcible change of \r\ngovernment is the legislative branch, as the peoples’ \r\nelected representatives are disbanded by the usurpers \r\nof power following any such illegal change of \r\ngovernment. \r\n Consequently, the legislative branch of any \r\nemergent democracy is invariably the least exposed to \r\nthe processes of governance and, thus, the one with the \r\nweakest institutional capacity and memory. It is \r\ntherefore important that we adopt measures at the \r\nnational, subregional, regional and even global levels \r\nto strengthen and consolidate the activities of this \r\nimportant branch of government, which, along with the \r\nexecutive and judicial branches, forms the tripod on \r\nwhich modern representative democracies stand. \r\n It is encouraging to note that cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\nis increasingly being deepened and widened in scope \r\nand content, despite its relatively recent inclusion on \r\nour agenda. It is particularly heartening to realize that \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union itself has carried out \r\nnumerous activities in support of the United Nations, \r\nnotably, in the fields of peace and security, economic \r\nand social development, international humanitarian law \r\nand human rights, democracy and gender issues, and so \r\nforth. \r\n Nigeria is keen to see a further development of \r\nthis mutually beneficial relationship between the \r\nUnited Nations and the IPU. The institution-building \r\nprogrammes of the IPU have been beneficial to a \r\nnumber of African countries in the past. As democracy \r\nis being consolidated on the continent, we trust that \r\nthese, as well as other programmes designed \r\nspecifically for emergent democracies in Africa, will \r\nbe embarked upon within the cooperative framework of \r\nthe IPU and the United Nations. \r\n It would be foolhardy to be complacent about the \r\nsuccess of democracy in countries that have recently \r\nembraced that system of governance. Often, the robust \r\ndiscussions and alternative views and voices that are \r\ninevitable parts of the democratic process can be \r\nmistaken for disagreement and dispute, leading to \r\nfrustration in the polity. In no other area is this \r\nmisconception more likely than in the area of law-\r\nmaking, an area with clearly defined responsibilities \r\nfor both the legislative and the executive branches. It is \r\ntherefore important that the role of functionaries and \r\nofficials in the two areas be harmonized, both at the \r\ngovernmental and party levels. The development of \r\nprogrammes under the United Nations-IPU cooperative \r\nframework for African parliaments, including members \r\nof opposition parties is therefore most welcome. \r\n It is the expectation of the Nigerian delegation \r\nthat this programme of cooperation and institution-\r\nbuilding will continue to be strengthened for the \r\nbenefit of the African peoples, many of whose \r\nlegitimate yearnings and aspirations are yet to be met. \r\nAlthough this might be due to the resource constraints \r\nfaced by individual African countries, in many cases it \r\n \r\n12  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\nis also due to the absence of representative government \r\nor, even where this exists, because of a \r\nmisunderstanding of the respective roles of the various \r\narms of government. \r\n As we commend the IPU’s commitment to \r\nassisting the United Nations in bringing a \r\nparliamentary dimension to its work, we urge that a \r\nrigorous assessment of the areas of priority be made, \r\ngiven the constraints imposed by resources. In this \r\nregard, democracy and development, and particularly \r\nthe promotion of good governance, transparency and \r\naccountability, should be given attention. Priority \r\nattention must equally be given to the economic \r\ndevelopment of emergent democracies, including \r\nthrough attention to debt cancellation, poverty \r\neradication and the eradication of the HIV/AIDS \r\npandemic, as well as other deadly diseases, such as \r\nmalaria and tuberculosis. National parliaments must \r\nalso assist the United Nations in giving speedy \r\nconsideration and approval, where necessary, to all \r\nmeasures aimed at conflict management and resolution. \r\nRobust legislative action is required at the national \r\nlevel to meet these challenges and to translate \r\ninternational agreements into appropriate laws. \r\n Finally, I wish, on behalf of the Nigerian \r\ndelegation, to commend all those involved in the \r\nforging of the multifaceted relationship between the \r\nUnited Nations and its programmes, the specialized \r\nagencies and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The \r\nGovernment and the people of Nigeria are ready to \r\nplay their part to further the realization of the \r\nobjectives of this relationship. \r\n Mr. Uddin (Bangladesh): Bangladesh welcomes \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on agenda item 26, \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union”. We very much appreciate \r\nthe role of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in \r\nadopting resolutions and carrying out activities in \r\nsupport of United Nations actions in the field of peace \r\nand security, economic and social development, \r\ninternational law and human rights, democracy, \r\ngovernance and gender issues. \r\n Bangladesh, along with many other democratic \r\ncountries, took part in the recently held Millennium \r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments in New York and adopted by consensus \r\n“The parliamentary vision for international cooperation \r\nat the dawn of the third millennium”. \r\n We therefore strongly believe in the ideals \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and once again \r\ncall upon Member States to work together to address \r\nthe main challenges facing the world community: the \r\nachievement of international peace and security, \r\ndemocracy, respect for human rights, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the ensuing social progress. We also \r\naffirm the principles of the Universal Declaration on \r\nDemocracy adopted by IPU and pledge to work \r\ntowards the establishment of a culture of democracy. \r\n As a member of the National Parliament, I can \r\nfirmly state that Bangladesh is committed to \r\ndemocracy and will do whatever is required to uphold \r\ndemocracy and democratic principles. I also take this \r\nopportunity to recall with pride and respect the \r\nsacrifices made by millions of my countrymen in 1971 \r\nto establish the rule of democracy. On this point, I wish \r\nto quote from the address of the Speaker of our \r\nNational Parliament made at the millennium \r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments. He said: \r\n “We may be the representatives of least \r\ndeveloped countries, but we are not representing \r\nthe least developed democracies and therefore we \r\nare willing and eager to assert our economic \r\nindependence and harness the advantages of a \r\nglobalized world.” \r\n Bangladesh welcomes the efforts of IPU in \r\nencouraging parliamentary action in support of the \r\nFourth World Conference on Women, the World \r\nSummit for Social Development and their subsequent \r\nfollow-ups. We also appreciate IPU’s role in \r\norganizing, on 7 June 2000, a tripartite consultation of \r\nGovernments, parliaments and international \r\norganizations on the theme “Democracy through \r\npartnership between men and women”. IPU \r\nconsultations are indeed quite helpful to national \r\nparliaments in shaping them as modern legislatures \r\nequipped with up-to-date information. \r\n Bangladesh requests IPU’s involvement in the \r\nongoing International Year for the Culture of Peace and \r\nseeks its support during the upcoming International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for \r\nthe Children of the World. We believe that IPU can \r\nplay a major role in establishing world peace, human \r\nrights and good governance, since legislators in every \r\ncountry of the world can use their respective law-\r\nmaking processes in achieving all these goals. On the \r\n \r\n 13 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\nissue of peace, I wish to quote Sheikh Hasina, the \r\nPrime Minister of Bangladesh: \r\n  “There is one value, one ideal and one \r\ndream common to all of us, and that is peace. We \r\ncherish peace with great affection. We consider \r\npeace to be of crucial importance all over the \r\nworld. We see peace as a fundamental human \r\nright. And we are committed to attain, sustain, \r\npromote and strengthen peace at all cost.” \r\n Finally, Bangladesh welcomes the vision of the \r\nSecretary-General in looking forward to enhanced \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union and firmly believes that this bond \r\nwill provide something remarkable for humankind at \r\nthe dawn of this new millennium. We have therefore \r\nbecome a sponsor of the draft resolution on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, introduced by the representative \r\nof India. Through this endeavour, we hope that the \r\nvoice of people around the globe will be heard more \r\nfrequently and clearly. \r\n Mr. Ferguson (Australia): As one of two \r\nparliamentary advisers to the Australian delegation to \r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, I am \r\npleased to participate in this debate on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU). \r\n Australia keenly supports efforts by the United \r\nNations, the IPU and Member States to strengthen the \r\nlinks between the two organizations. In particular, we \r\nsupport the draft resolution submitted by the delegation \r\nof India, which asks that we look at ways in which the \r\nUnited Nations and IPU can develop a new, formalized \r\nrelationship that reflects the special nature of the IPU \r\nand the contribution that both bodies can make to each \r\nother’s work. \r\n With a membership drawn from parliaments and \r\nnational assemblies of over 140 countries, as well as 38 \r\ninternational organizations that have observer status, \r\nthe IPU provides a unique forum for discussion and \r\nexchange on a broad range of topics, from international \r\npeace and security to the promotion of human rights \r\nand the environment. \r\n Through its conferences and reports, the IPU has \r\nthe potential to offer the United Nations and other \r\nbodies different perspectives — legislators’ \r\nperspectives — from around the globe on issues \r\naffecting the international community. Often these \r\nperspectives will accord with the views of the \r\nGovernment of the day, but they will also reflect other \r\npolitical interests and concerns, including those of \r\ncommunity groups, non-governmental organizations, \r\nbusiness and the trade unions. A legislator’s \r\nperspective, like that of the private sector or civil \r\nsociety more broadly, is invaluable to deliberations and \r\ndecision-making at the intergovernmental level. \r\n Australia sees scope for increased coordination of \r\nthe United Nations and the IPU activities. Under a \r\nmore formalized relationship, it may be possible for the \r\nIPU to structure its conferences and work agendas to \r\nlink into areas of United Nations discussion, for \r\nexample in studying the impact of globalization on \r\nemployment and labour standards, or perhaps on \r\ndeveloping strategies to fight HIV/AIDS. \r\n We note that the IPU has an effective committee \r\nstructure that could ably assist the United Nations \r\ndeliberations through its inquiries and reports. There \r\nmay be scope for the IPU to submit reports to \r\nparticular committees of the United Nations General \r\nAssembly for further consideration. \r\n One of the continuing challenges facing the \r\nUnited Nations, and indeed its Member States, is how \r\nto sustain support for the goals and objectives of the \r\ninternational system among national legislatures and \r\nlawmakers. If anything, this challenge is becoming \r\nharder, not easier, as Governments and peoples work to \r\naddress the powerful effects of economic and social \r\nglobalization. \r\n In the same way that the IPU can provide input \r\ninto the deliberations of the United Nations, it can also \r\nprovide a platform for increasing parliamentary \r\nunderstanding of and support for the United Nations \r\nwork. Importantly, the IPU, through its members, can \r\nchallenge some of the common — but often deeply \r\nentrenched — misconceptions about the United \r\nNations, as well as prompt closer parliamentary \r\nscrutiny of the benefits and obligations of participation \r\nin the United Nations system. \r\n The United Nations future depends very much on \r\nits ability to secure the continued commitment of \r\nMember States to the United Nations system. In small \r\npart, this consolidation must start with building more \r\neffective partnerships with organizations such as the \r\nIPU and its members, which would help to find new \r\nareas for cooperation. \r\n \r\n14  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\n Mr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nshould like to express our delegation’s gratitude for the \r\nintroduction of the draft resolution on “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union” during the past year. Just a few \r\nmonths ago, from 30 August to 1 September 2000, the \r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, convened in this same Hall, just before \r\nthe special session of the General Assembly known as \r\nthe Millennium Assembly of the United Nations. \r\n The holding of this Conference was an important \r\nlandmark in the cooperation between the United \r\nNations, as an international body that reflects the \r\naspirations and concerns of States, and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU), which represents the \r\nconcerns and hopes of the peoples of the world. This \r\nConference underlined the importance of the \r\nrelationship between these two organizations. It \r\nemphasized the need for the United Nations to take \r\ninto account the opinions, proposals and decisions of \r\nthe IPU, since the Union represents and reflects the \r\nopinions of parliaments, which in turn represent the \r\nopinions of peoples. The word “peoples” is mentioned \r\nat the beginning of the United Nations Charter: “We \r\nthe peoples of the United Nations”.  \r\n The United Nations needs to hear, more than ever \r\nbefore, the views of the peoples, in view of the great \r\ninternational imbalances and the efforts of the United \r\nStates to prevent United Nations bodies from making \r\ndecisions that do not serve its egotistical interests. \r\nEfforts by IPU to make the voice of the peoples heard \r\nin the United Nations adds a democratic dimension to \r\nthe international decision-making process and ensures \r\nthe rule of law. The conclusion of the cooperation \r\nagreement between the United Nations and the IPU has \r\ncontinued to give great interest to the international \r\nactivities that strengthen those of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly in the fields of peacekeeping, economic \r\nand social development, international law and human \r\nrights. \r\n At this stage, I would like to highlight the \r\nimportant contribution made by the IPU Conference at \r\nits one hundred fourth session. The resolution adopted \r\nthere stressed the increased attention given by the \r\nUnion to the problems that people face owing to \r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council. The \r\nprinciples contained in the resolution are considered \r\nguidelines for such sanctions, and the United Nations \r\nshould take them into account because they reflect the \r\nopinions of the representatives of the peoples of the \r\nworld. \r\n The last resolution stressed that economic \r\nsanctions should be avoided and that if they are \r\nimposed their objectives must be defined precisely and \r\nmust have a time limit. Furthermore, global economic \r\nsanctions should not be imposed because they harm too \r\nmany innocent people. The resolution also stressed the \r\nneed for sanctions to include exceptions for \r\nhumanitarian purposes. \r\n With regard to the economic sanctions imposed \r\non Iraq, the IPU’s resolution included a clear paragraph \r\nto the effect that the Security Council should remove \r\nall global sanctions, including those imposed on Iraq, \r\nand that there should be a re-evaluation of the whole \r\nsystem of sanctions, including those now in force, in \r\nlight of the above-mentioned principles. This no doubt \r\nreflects the will of the people of the world to put an \r\nend to the disastrous effects of comprehensive \r\nsanctions on peoples and to ensure that the Security \r\nCouncil recognizes that sanctions are responsible for \r\nthe suffering of peoples. Therefore the Council is \r\ncalled upon to heed the Union’s appeal to lift the global \r\nsanctions imposed on Iraq if it is to comply with the \r\nmandate entrusted to it by Member States. We also call \r\nupon the Union to pursue the application of its \r\nresolution so that the Security Council renounces \r\nrecourse to sanctions as an economic and political \r\nmeans of depriving peoples of their fundamental rights. \r\n We reiterate once again that it is necessary to \r\ndevelop detailed relations between the IPU and the \r\nUnited Nations to cover all United Nations bodies, \r\nincluding the General Assembly and its subsidiary \r\norgans, with a view to strengthening cooperation and \r\npartnership between the two organizations. On the \r\nbasis of this principle, Iraq has become a sponsor of \r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/55/L.20. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): There is no task more urgent and more \r\nimportant than the democratization of international \r\nrelations. Without it, efforts for peace, development \r\nand cooperation would be futile. The United Nations \r\nhas the fundamental responsibility to attain that \r\nobjective. \r\n The parliamentarians of the entire world recently \r\nreaffirmed at the Conference of Presiding Officers of \r\nNational Parliaments their commitment to the United \r\nNations and its purposes and principles. The final \r\n \r\n 15 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\nDeclaration confirmed the need for a greater \r\ncontribution by the parliamentarians to international \r\nrelations and in particular to the work of the United \r\nNations. \r\n That conference, held as an integral part of the \r\npreparatory process for the Millennium Summit and \r\nAssembly, under resolution 54/12 of 27 October 1999, \r\nwas of special importance in highlighting the scope \r\nand the strengthening of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\n(IPU) and also to show the potential for a greater \r\ncontribution by parliamentarians the world over, \r\nthrough the IPU, to the work of the United Nations in \r\nthe years to come. \r\n The Cuban delegation welcomes and supports \r\ncloser cooperation between the two organizations and \r\nconsiders that Member States and the parliamentarians \r\nof the world should broaden their relations in a more \r\nproductive way. The opening, in March 1998, of the \r\nIPU Liaison Office with the United Nations in New \r\nYork has facilitated and greatly contributed to this. The \r\nSecretary-General, in his report (A/55/409), \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union”, dated 18 October 2000, \r\nexpresses his hope that in the future there will be \r\ngreater and closer cooperation between the two \r\norganizations. \r\n However, the position taken by the host country \r\nof the United Nations regarding the granting of visas \r\nfor the participation of certain representatives of \r\nnational parliaments at the Conference of Presiding \r\nOfficers of National Parliaments, unfortunately \r\nreflected a serious lack of commitment to these \r\nobjectives. Cuba’s participation was obstructed by the \r\narbitrary and discriminatory decision of the authorities \r\nof the host country, which denied a visa to the \r\nPresident of the National Assembly of People’s Power, \r\nRicardo Alarcón de Quesada, a situation that left the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union with no alternative but to \r\naccept as a fait accompli a violation of one of its \r\nfundamental principles. \r\n The United States authorities are obliged to \r\nhonour their commitments as host of the Headquarters \r\nof the United Nations and to provide all facilities for \r\nevents directly related to it. It is regrettable that, with \r\nthis behaviour, the authorities of the host country have \r\njoined the United States Congress’s boycott of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Thus far there has been strict respect for the \r\nfundamental principle of the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\nthat it can only meet if all its members and observers \r\nhave been invited, and if its representatives have been \r\nassured that they will receive the necessary visas to \r\nparticipate. That principle is fully in force and cannot \r\nbe disregarded. Cuba completely supports this \r\nfounding principle of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, \r\nwhich makes it a universal international organization, \r\nand reaffirms the need for its complete observance. \r\n The Cuban delegation thanks all the participants \r\nin the Conference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, and the IPU, for their energetic rejection \r\nof the arbitrary and discriminatory decision of the \r\nauthorities of the host country of the United Nations to \r\ndeny visas to representatives of certain national \r\nparliaments. \r\n Lastly, the Cuban delegation wishes to take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate the invitation extended by the \r\nNational Assembly of People’s Power of Cuba to all \r\nthe members and observers of the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion — without exception, on the basis of the \r\nprinciple I have set out — to participate in its 105th \r\nConference, which will be held in Havana from 1 to 7 \r\nApril 2001. \r\n Mr. Sun (Republic of Korea): In facing a myriad \r\nof challenges, democracy and the rule of law are the \r\nmost fundamental principles to be upheld, as was \r\nagreed in both the Declaration of the Millennium \r\nSummit and “The parliamentary vision of international \r\ncooperation”. Their importance lies in the fact that the \r\npromotion of democratic institutions and the process of \r\nrepresentation are the backbone of the success in \r\nmeeting these challenges. In this regard, my delegation \r\nhighly appreciates the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) \r\nfor its contribution not only to the promotion of \r\ndemocratic principles in individual States, but also to \r\nsupporting and advancing daunting tasks on every \r\nimportant agenda of a global scale, such as \r\ninternational peace and security, economic and social \r\ndevelopment, international law, human rights and \r\ngender issues. My delegation also commends the \r\nefforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan to set the \r\npriorities among the outstanding tasks and to \r\ncoordinate the work between the United Nations and \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n The Millennium Summit elaborated many of the \r\nchallenges and tasks facing the international \r\n \r\n16  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\ncommunity, which will only meet with success through \r\nthe broad support of peoples and their representatives. \r\nMy delegation is of the view that the United Nations \r\nwould be better able to promote most of its agenda \r\nthrough a cooperative relationship with the IPU. \r\n The Government of the Republic of Korea has \r\nbeen working closely with its National Assembly to \r\nkeep its commitments to the work of the United \r\nNations in all aspects, including our continued support \r\nfor peacekeeping operations, particularly in East \r\nTimor. \r\n The Republic of Korea has lent its full support to \r\nthe cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union since this issue was \r\nincluded as an agenda item at the plenary of the fiftieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We believe that close \r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the IPU \r\nis essential, among others things, to promoting peace \r\nand security around the world and resolving problems \r\nof underdevelopment by getting their representatives \r\ndirectly involved in those global agendas. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nIPU has seen a milestone year in 2000. We were \r\nespecially pleased to see the successful conclusion of \r\nthe Conference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, indicating great potential for a positive \r\nfuture relationship between the United Nations and the \r\nIPU. \r\n We gladly note that the Conference of Presiding \r\nOfficers, held in conjunction with the Millennium \r\nAssembly, confirmed the guiding principles needed to \r\nmeet the challenges ahead of us and stressed the need \r\nfor increased parliamentary inputs to the work of the \r\nUnited Nations. We believe that this Conference \r\nsignificantly contributed to the overall millennium \r\nproceedings. My delegation noted with satisfaction that \r\nthe “Parliamentary vision of international \r\ncooperation”, adopted at the Conference, provided us \r\nwith a perspective on the global agenda that is in \r\nkeeping with the Millennium Declaration. \r\n Based on this common perspective, my \r\ndelegation believes that the United Nations and the \r\nIPU can rejoice in the ample opportunity they have to \r\ncultivate productive and substantive relations, going \r\nbeyond declarations. In this regard, such pragmatic \r\nprogrammes as the one set up between the IPU and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Fund, aimed at assisting \r\nefforts in many countries to develop democratic \r\ninstitutions, should be encouraged. We request the \r\nSecretary-General to further explore areas where \r\npractical programmes between the United Nations and \r\nthe IPU can take root. \r\n The IPU has successfully supported the \r\npromotion of new norms in such areas as disarmament, \r\neconomic and social development, human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, the environment and \r\ngender issues. However, the IPU can play a more \r\ncrucial role in establishing new international regimes \r\nby encouraging parliaments of individual States to \r\nratify the appropriate conventions and treaties worked \r\nout within the framework of the United Nations system \r\nand to appropriate funds necessary for implementing \r\nrelated programmes and commitments. \r\n We note with satisfaction the continuous \r\nexpansion of the mutual relations between the United \r\nNations and the IPU since the Cooperation Agreement \r\nin 1996. Let me also take this opportunity to draw \r\nattention to the commendable efforts of the IPU liaison \r\noffice here in New York, particularly for their \r\ncontribution to the millennium events. \r\n Following up on the successful conclusion of the \r\nMillennium Summit, we are now faced with the all-\r\nimportant task of how to best translate its outcomes \r\ninto reality. My Government has co-sponsored the draft \r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the belief that a \r\nstronger relationship between the General Assembly \r\nand its subsidiary organs and the IPU will indeed \r\ncontribute to achieving our common goals. My \r\nappreciation also goes to the Indian delegation for its \r\nintroduction of the draft resolution. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to renew the \r\ncommitment of the Republic of Korea to furthering the \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the IPU \r\nand to the cause of bringing our work at the United \r\nNations ever closer to the people. \r\n Mr. Vassallo (Malta): Ten weeks ago this Hall \r\nwas the venue of a very special occasion in the form of \r\nthe Conference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\n(IPU). Parliamentarians of the world, whose legitimacy \r\nto speak on behalf of their constituents runs parallel to \r\nthat which we as representatives of Governments \r\nclaim, met here on the eve of the Millennium Summit. \r\n \r\n 17 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\n For a few days we entered this Chamber only to \r\nfind our seats occupied by individuals whose faces, \r\nthough familiar, rarely, if ever, grace this Hall; faces \r\nthat we associate with our local political scenes and \r\nwith exchanges of a rather more acrimonious nature \r\nthan we are used to here at the United Nations. \r\n Our parliamentary presiding officers and \r\nmembers of parliament converged on this building to \r\nexpress their views on the concepts that were soon \r\nafterwards captured in the Millennium Declaration. \r\nExpress their views they did, and for this we are \r\ngrateful. \r\n But the Conference of Presiding Officers served \r\nanother purpose in the manner in which it succeeded in \r\nbringing a number of concepts to the fore. First is the \r\nlink between what we do here and what \r\nparliamentarians, in similar settings, are called upon to \r\ndo at home. One should avoid suggesting that either \r\nthe United Nations or a national parliament is more \r\nimportant than the other in addressing international \r\nchallenges. To do so would be akin to debating whether \r\na national government is more effective than a local \r\ngovernment in improving the lives of ordinary people. \r\nThe truth is that neither of them can deliver \r\nsatisfactory results without the cooperation and support \r\nof the other. \r\n Diplomats can gain the impression that the \r\nprescriptions devised in these halls could in effect \r\nprovide solutions domestically if only national \r\nparliaments would see the big picture and be less \r\nengrossed in local perspectives. \r\n On the other hand, local parliamentarians often \r\nbemoan the solutions originating in international \r\nforums for their lack of connectedness with the \r\nsituation on the ground and for the manner in which \r\nthey sometimes conflict with the perceived national \r\ninterests. \r\n My delegation believes that the IPU’s Conference \r\nof Presiding Officers served to highlight the fact that \r\nour agendas here at the United Nations and in our \r\nnational legislatures are linked in many spheres and \r\nthat, more importantly, solutions to many of the \r\nchallenges we face can be achieved only through better \r\nmutual understanding and cooperation between these \r\ntwo representative bodies. There is nevertheless a \r\ndivision of labour to be respected, one which is based \r\non the differing natures of these institutions. \r\n The Conference of Presiding Officers served yet \r\nanother purpose by drawing attention to the working \r\nmethods of our national parliaments and contrasting \r\nthem with our own methods here at the United Nations. \r\nPerhaps there are lessons to be learned from them — \r\nand I refer here not only to the enviable punctuality \r\nwhich the Conference of Presiding Officers succeeded \r\nin exhibiting during its proceedings. National \r\nlegislatures are, like the United Nations, assemblies of \r\nrepresentatives, with onerous responsibilities towards \r\nlarge numbers of people who often rely on them to \r\nguarantee their rights, their freedoms and their \r\nlivelihoods. Nevertheless, the differences between the \r\npractices of this Organization and those of our national \r\nparliaments are rather pronounced. While \r\nparliamentarians are doubtless as capable as we are of \r\ninflicting endless rhetoric upon each other, legislative \r\nassemblies enjoy a greater sense of urgency in much of \r\ntheir work and a greater urge to cut to the chase and \r\nreach conclusions. Whereas in drafting statements \r\nmany of us ask ourselves what a speech on a particular \r\nissue from our country must include, parliamentarians \r\nseem to ask themselves what new angle or argument \r\nthey can add to a debate, even if they may do so for \r\ntheir own particular reasons. \r\n The stock-in-trade of parliaments includes \r\nlegislative measures, but, as at the United Nations, it \r\nalso includes resolutions. Legislatures resolve to \r\nsupport many ideas and initiatives, but rarely do they \r\ndo so in an identical fashion year after year. Clearly, \r\nthe United Nations is faced with many critical political \r\nsituations and concerns that need to be reiterated at \r\nevery session of the General Assembly. But can that \r\nreally be said of all the draft resolutions we bring \r\nbefore this body every 12 months? Why is it that \r\nnational parliaments feel satisfied to pass non-binding \r\nresolutions once, while the United Nations feels that it \r\nis important to repeat itself every year to make the \r\npoint? Certainly there is scope for the United Nations \r\nas a whole, and its constituent Members, to take a look \r\nat the manner in which we utilize our indispensable \r\nOrganization and to be prepared, perhaps, to take a leaf \r\nout of the book of our national legislatures. \r\n Apart from providing an opportunity for the \r\nUnited Nations to engage in an exercise in self-\r\nexamination, the Inter-Parliamentary Union is involved \r\nin numerous worthy initiatives. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the IPU, which this delegation warmly \r\n \r\n18  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\nwelcomes, clearly illustrates that many of these \r\ninitiatives coincide with issues that we are also seized \r\nwith at the United Nations. The added value of the \r\ninvolvement of the IPU in these issues lies in the \r\nspecial contribution that it can make as a result of its \r\nunique nature and membership. \r\n While within the United Nations Malta has \r\ncontinuously supported initiatives aimed at peace and \r\nmutual development of economic interests in the \r\nMediterranean, it was the IPU that provided the first \r\nplatform for an exclusively Mediterranean political \r\ndialogue. Malta was among the countries that in the \r\nearly 1990s proposed having a Conference on Security \r\nand Cooperation in the Mediterranean (CSCM) process \r\nwithin the IPU. Three Inter-Parliamentary Conferences \r\non Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean have \r\nsince taken place, the last one in Marseilles in April of \r\nthis year. In the words of Foreign Minister Mr. Joseph \r\nBorg, \r\n “the consistent exchange of views over the years \r\nwithin the CSCM have given us a clear picture of \r\nthose features in the political, economic and \r\nsocio-cultural fields that provide for common \r\nunderstanding among the littoral States”. \r\n The success of the Conferences encouraged us to \r\npropose the institutionalization of the process that we \r\nare now endeavouring to transform into a \r\nparliamentary assembly of Mediterranean States. The \r\none hundred and fourth IPU Conference, held in \r\nJakarta last month, was unanimous in upholding the \r\neventual establishment of such a parliamentary \r\nassembly. We consider the establishment of a \r\nparliamentary assembly of Mediterranean States within \r\nthe IPU to be a qualitative leap forward, providing the \r\nregion with a unique political setting, bringing together \r\nall the States of the Mediterranean on an equal footing \r\nin a regional forum of their own. \r\n While the United Nations continues to play its \r\nrole in seeking to resolve several old and sometimes \r\ndisheartening questions in the Mediterranean basin, \r\ncooperation with organizations like the IPU and their \r\nspecialized bodies can provide the United Nations with \r\ninvaluable benefits that complement its own \r\nendeavours. \r\n My delegation is highly supportive of the many \r\nother IPU initiatives referred to in the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of France on behalf of \r\nthe European Union, with which Malta has aligned \r\nitself. Malta continues to support the further \r\nenhancement of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the IPU and is therefore once again a \r\nsponsor of the draft resolution we are to adopt shortly. \r\n Mr. Fonseca (Brazil): Brazil is very pleased to \r\nparticipate in this debate. For more than a century now, \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) has been an \r\nincremental force in promoting cooperation and \r\nunderstanding among parliamentarians of different \r\nnations. Like parliaments, the United Nations is about \r\ndemocracy and participation, negotiation and \r\nrepresentation. \r\n In carrying out the mandate it has been entrusted \r\nwith by international society, the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion has clearly demonstrated over the years that it \r\nshares the goals the United Nations has set out to \r\naccomplish. Ranging over a wide set of issues — from \r\neconomic and social development to peace, the \r\neradication of poverty, security and human rights — \r\nthe IPU helps to intensify the dialogue among societies \r\nand nations and is thus a major contributor to the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations. Cooperation between \r\nthe IPU and the United Nations is natural and \r\nnecessary. The creation of a more stable and more just \r\ninternational order is our common endeavour. \r\n The participation of parliamentary observers in \r\nthe General Assembly, for example, is a long-standing \r\nBrazilian practice that offers an opportunity for our \r\nCongressmen to interact with their colleagues from \r\nacross the globe, as do other IPU meetings. This is a \r\nnatural consequence of the close interaction between \r\ndomestic and international affairs. To give but two \r\nexamples in the economic field, Brazil’s international \r\ntrade profile and the integration of the economies of \r\nLatin America — especially the consolidation of the \r\nSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR) — are in \r\nfact matters of daily attention on the part of Brazilian \r\nCongressmen. In the political and legal field, Brazil’s \r\ninternational commitment to disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation and our participation in the negotiations \r\nthat led to the creation of the International Criminal \r\nCourt are also matters of lively interest to the Brazilian \r\nCongress. \r\n We were very pleased at the outcome of the \r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments, which was held in the United Nations \r\nfrom 30 August to 1 September 2000. The Declaration \r\nentitled “The Parliamentary vision of international \r\n \r\n 19 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\ncooperation on the eve of the third millennium” has \r\nbeen an extremely valuable contribution to the work of \r\nthe Millennium Assembly. \r\n Brazil is honoured to be among the sponsors of \r\nthe draft resolution (A/55/L.20) before the Assembly \r\ntoday. We are convinced that the United Nations and \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union will become even more \r\neffective instruments for the advancement and common \r\ndevelopment of the international community in coming \r\nyears if cooperation between them is further expanded \r\nand enhanced. \r\n Mr. Darwish (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I wish \r\nfirst of all to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, for his valuable report on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\n(IPU) (A/55/409). The Egyptian delegation attaches \r\nparticular importance to the debate on this important \r\nagenda item, “Cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union”. \r\n Just as the United Nations is made up of \r\nrepresentatives of the world’s States and Governments, \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union is composed of \r\nrepresentatives of the world’s peoples. It is therefore a \r\nspecial counterpart of the United Nations and can \r\ncertainly make a significant contribution to the \r\nOrganization’s work at the international level. \r\n I take this opportunity to reaffirm the importance \r\nthat Egypt attaches to the activities of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union and to strengthening the \r\nrelationship between the IPU and the United Nations: \r\nthe IPU is an important forum for expressing the will \r\nof representatives of the world’s peoples, along with \r\ntheir hopes, their concerns and their priorities. \r\n The Egyptian delegation believes that \r\nstrengthening the relationship between the United \r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union in line with \r\nexisting rules and resolutions would respond to the \r\ndesire expressed by heads of State or Government at \r\nthe Millennium Summit in September 2000. The \r\nMillennium Declaration recommended the \r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the IPU in various fields, including peace \r\nand security, economic and social development, \r\ninternational law and human rights and democracy and \r\nother issues vital to the international community. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nIPU was reflected in the convening of the Conference \r\nof Presiding Officers of National Parliaments, which \r\nwas held in the United Nations from 30 August to 1 \r\nSeptember 2000 at the margins of the Millennium \r\nSummit. The Conference Declaration outlined the main \r\nchallenges facing the world at the outset of the new \r\nmillennium, and indicated how parliamentarians intend \r\nto meet those challenges in keeping with the interests \r\nof the international community. The Declaration \r\nreaffirmed the commitment of the IPU to the noble \r\nprinciples that, we hope, will guide the international \r\ncommunity: the rule of law, respect for human rights \r\nand democracy. \r\n The IPU has a leading role to play in expressing \r\nthe will of the world’s peoples. That is why its \r\ndecisions and resolutions must be taken into \r\nconsideration and why the international community \r\nmust heed the voice of peoples that express themselves \r\nthrough the Union. \r\n The Egyptian delegation wishes to draw attention \r\nto an important resolution adopted by an overwhelming \r\nmajority of members of the IPU at their Jakarta \r\nconference last October. It related to the need to end \r\ntension in the Middle East, to protect Palestinian \r\ncivilians in accordance with the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian \r\nPersons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and to \r\npursue the peace process in accordance with relevant \r\nresolutions of the United Nations. That IPU resolution \r\ncondemned Israel for its acts of provocation. Israel’s \r\nfailure to respect the sanctity of Islam’s holy places has \r\nfuelled violence in the occupied territories. As a result, \r\nthousands of unarmed Palestinian civilians have been \r\nwounded and dozens killed, including many children. \r\nThe resolution called upon Israel to put an end to its \r\nmilitary operations in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories and to comply with the provisions of the \r\nFourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of \r\nCivilian Persons in Time of War. The resolution further \r\nreaffirmed the applicability of that Convention to all \r\nthe Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. That \r\nresolution was supported by some 1,000 members of \r\nthe world’s parliaments and once again showed that the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union is the voice of the world’s \r\npeople and is the enemy of injustice and occupation. \r\n I wish in conclusion to state our support for the \r\ndraft resolution before the Assembly (A/55/L.20) on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. We invite delegations to adopt it \r\nwithout a vote so that we can all affirm the importance \r\n \r\n20  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\nwe attach to the strengthening of that cooperation and \r\nso that we can express our sincere will to strengthen it \r\nat every level. \r\n Mr. Tarabrin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Conference of Presiding Officers of \r\nNational Parliaments, which took place on the eve of \r\nthe Millennium Summit, was a convincing \r\ndemonstration of the powerful potential of \r\nparliamentary diplomacy. As the President of the \r\nRussian State Duma and member of the preparatory \r\ncommittee for that Conference, Mr. Guennadi N. \r\nSeleznev, said in his statement at the Conference, \r\nparliamentary diplomacy is becoming an important \r\nelement of international dialogue. \r\n Through their world organization, the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU), national legislatures are \r\nready to play a more active role in solving the \r\nmultifaceted problems facing mankind in the new \r\ncentury. It is clear from the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/55/409) that the work of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union today embraces a broad range of \r\nissues that increasingly coincide with the key areas of \r\nthe work of the United Nations. These include peace \r\nand security, economic and social development, \r\ninternational law, human rights, the strengthening of \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, improving the status of \r\nwomen and dialogue among civilizations. \r\n We are justifiably proud of the participation by \r\nRussian parliamentarians in the varied activities of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union, especially in its United \r\nNations segment. The contribution of Russians is \r\nespecially notable in such important areas of the IPU’s \r\nwork as the campaign for world and regional peace and \r\nsecurity, especially in the Mediterranean; the \r\npartnership between men and women in politics; and \r\nmeetings of women members of parliaments. \r\n Moreover, participation in the work of the IPU is \r\nan important way for the Russian Parliament to learn \r\nabout the experience of international \r\nparliamentarianism, the building of democratic \r\ninstitutions and international politics. Extensive links \r\namong parliaments and participation by members of \r\nparliaments in international forums and negotiations \r\nhave had a positive influence on the quality of the \r\nwork of the State Duma and the Federation Council \r\nrelating to the ratification of international treaties. In \r\nrecent years, our legislature has ratified more than 250 \r\ninternational agreements, including the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the START II treaty \r\nbetween Russia and the United States. \r\n The Government of the Russian Federation \r\nwelcomes and encourages a constructive and interested \r\napproach on the part of our members of parliament \r\ntowards international activities. It is no coincidence \r\nthat, in addition to President Vladimir Putin, the \r\nofficial delegation of the Russian Federation to the \r\nMillennium Summit included the first Deputy Speaker \r\nof the State Duma, L. K. Sliska, and the Chairman of \r\nthe Foreign Affairs Committee of the State Duma, D. \r\nO. Rogozin. \r\n The goal of investing international cooperation \r\nwith a parliamentary dimension, proclaimed in the \r\nfinal declaration of the Conference of Presiding \r\nOfficers of National Parliaments, deserves full support. \r\nThe further goal-oriented involvement in the work of \r\nthe United Nations of such a unique non-governmental \r\norganization as the IPU will inevitably promote the \r\nfurther democratization of international relations. This \r\nis a reflection of the parliamentary aspect of the current \r\ntrend towards enhancing the role of civil society in all \r\nareas of contemporary life, including through \r\ncooperation with the United Nations system. The voice \r\nof the people, and, above all, the voice of their elected \r\nrepresentatives, must be heard within these walls and \r\nthus promote the adoption by the Governments \r\nrepresented here of correct and wise decisions. Russia \r\nsees in the extension of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the IPU not only an important \r\nsupport mechanism for resolving difficult international \r\nproblems, but a means of strengthening the United \r\nNations itself and enhancing the authority of our \r\nOrganization through the contribution that the \r\nmembers of legislative assemblies can make to its \r\nwork. \r\n In the final declaration — “The parliamentary \r\nvision for international cooperation at the dawn of the \r\nthird millennium” — the presiding officers of national \r\nparliaments unambiguously stated that the role of the \r\nUnited Nations is more important than ever before and \r\nmust serve as a cornerstone for broad and effective \r\nglobal cooperation. That is our common goal, and we \r\nare convinced that the strengthening of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union will promote its attainment. This \r\nis also our assessment of the draft resolution that was \r\nintroduced by the representative of India. We would \r\n \r\n 21 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\nlike to co-sponsor the draft resolution and hope that it \r\nwill be adopted by consensus. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item. \r\n We shall now proceed to take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/55/L.20, as orally revised. \r\n Before taking action on the draft resolution, I \r\nshould like to announce that, since its introduction, the \r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/55/L.20: Algeria, the Bahamas, Bhutan, \r\nColombia, France, Georgia, Guinea, Indonesia, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, \r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Madagascar, Mongolia, \r\nMozambique, Namibia, Nauru, Norway, the Russian \r\nFederation, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago and Zambia. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/55/L.20, as orally revised? \r\n Draft resolution A/55/L.20, as orally revised, was \r\nadopted (resolution 55/19). \r\n The President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. \r\n May I remind members that statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the \r\nsecond intervention, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Schacham (Israel): The representative of \r\nEgypt has unfortunately used this debate on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU) to voice a political attack \r\nagainst my country. It is my understanding that the \r\nJakarta resolution regarding the Middle East does not \r\ncondemn Israel, and appeals to both sides to work to \r\nend the violence and to return to negotiations. Only a \r\nfortnight ago, Egypt graciously hosted the Sharm el-\r\nSheikh summit, at which an Israeli-Palestinian \r\nagreement was reached on ending the violence — an \r\nagreement which we are trying to implement today. \r\nThat summit recognized that neither side in this \r\nconflict has a monopoly on the status of victim and that \r\nboth sides must act to bring about an end to violence. \r\nIndeed, President Mubarak of Egypt spoke there of the \r\nneed for both sides to return to the peace process and \r\nto end the cycle of violence. In this light, the words of \r\nthe representative of Egypt, which seek to misrepresent \r\nIsrael, are unreflective, at the very best, of Egypt’s \r\npronounced and greatly appreciated role as a supporter \r\nand facilitator of the Middle East peace process. Such \r\npolitical manipulation of the IPU Jakarta resolution \r\nonly undermines the IPU, an organization which all \r\nsides in our region respect. \r\n Mr. Darwish (Egypt): Once more, the \r\nrepresentative of Israel is attempting to alter and distort \r\nthe facts pertaining to the escalation of violence in \r\nPalestine and trying to avoid pinning the situation on \r\nanybody. The representative of Israel is ignoring the \r\nwell-documented facts that the violence was a \r\nconsequence of, and a reaction to, the provocative visit \r\nto the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Daily atrocities and gross \r\nviolations of human rights were then committed on an \r\nalmost hourly basis by the Israeli occupying forces, \r\nwhich were armed to the teeth, against Palestinian \r\ncivilians, women and men, old and young, including \r\nschoolboys and schoolgirls under the age of 10. \r\n It is indeed puzzling and mind-boggling that in \r\nthis regard Israel ignores its responsibility in this \r\nregard — a responsibility that is well-known and well \r\ndocumented. The Security Council, the General \r\nAssembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Conference — to name just a few \r\nbodies — without exception, pointed the finger at \r\nIsraeli responsibility in this regard.  \r\n Could it be possible that the international \r\ncommunity, as represented in those different forums, is \r\nwrong, and that Israel is right? Israel can fool some of \r\nthe people some of the time, and all of the people some \r\nof the time, but it cannot fool all of the people all of \r\nthe time. \r\n Finally, it is important that Israel work with its \r\nPalestinian partners towards establishing peace — \r\ndurable and everlasting peace, based on the principle of \r\nland for peace, Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \r\nand 338 (1973) and full respect for and recognition of \r\nthe legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including the \r\nright to establish their own State with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital. \r\n Mr. Schacham (Israel): It is extremely \r\ndisingenuous of the Egyptian representative to couch \r\nthe current violence in religious terms and to attempt to \r\nportray Israeli actions as a threat to the sanctity and \r\nintegrity of other religious faiths. The current violence \r\nis wholly unrelated to any religious dispute, and any \r\nattempts to create such a connection is a fabrication \r\n \r\n22  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.55  \r\ndeliberately aimed at widening the conflict, sharpening \r\nthe religious divide and creating inter-religious \r\ntensions where there are none. \r\n The most blatant attempt to foment religious \r\nstrife is the recent action of Palestinian gunmen, who \r\nhave consciously taken up positions in or near \r\nChristian institutions in the village of Beit Jala, from \r\nwhere they direct fire at the Jewish residents of the \r\nnearby Gilo neighbourhood of Jerusalem. This \r\nappalling use of a religious site is intended not only to \r\nkill Jewish targets but also to draw Israeli return fire, \r\nwhich will damage the Christian shrines and inflame \r\nthe Christian world against the Jewish people. \r\n The unrelenting focus, mentioned again by the \r\nEgyptian representative, on the alleged provocation of \r\nIsraeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon’s visit to the \r\nTemple Mount stems from a similar motivation. The \r\nvisit of an Israeli politician to Judaism’s most holy site \r\nis repeatedly portrayed as though it must obviously be \r\nan affront to Muslims, in a further attempt to broaden \r\nthe conflict between Palestinians and Israelis and to \r\nrecast it as one between Judaism and Islam. \r\n Unfortunately, this has not been the only \r\nexample. The oft-repeated mantra from various Arab \r\nspokesmen protesting the Judaization of Jerusalem \r\ncould be considered historically ludicrous were it not \r\nso blatantly malicious, blasphemous and dehumanizing \r\nto those of the Jewish faith. Jerusalem needs no \r\nJudaization. The city is mentioned hundreds of times in \r\nthe Jewish bible, is a central theme of Jewish ritual and \r\nhas been the site of continuous Jewish presence for \r\n3,000 years. \r\n Further examples abound. Joseph’s Tomb, in \r\nNablus, after being temporarily evacuated under an \r\nagreement with the Palestinian police, was brutally \r\ndestroyed, and Jewish ritual objects were burned and \r\ndesecrated. The site was subsequently rededicated as a \r\nMuslim mosque. The ancient Shalom Al Israel \r\nsynagogue, near Jericho, was the target of Palestinian \r\narson. Rachel’s Tomb, near Bethlehem, has repeatedly \r\nbeen subjected to a hail of Palestinian machine-gun \r\nfire. \r\n These are the sort of religious atrocities that \r\nwould have caused worldwide religious outcry and \r\ndenunciation had they been perpetrated against any \r\nother religion or in any other place in the world. The \r\nforced closure of Judaism’s most revered site of prayer, \r\nthe Western Wall, on the eve of the Rosh Hashanah \r\nhigh holiday, as a result of the stoning of Jewish \r\nworshipers by Palestinians, is tantamount to the \r\nevacuation of St. Peter’s Square on Christmas or the \r\nshutdown of Mecca’s Kaaba during the height of the \r\nhajj. \r\n And yet the Palestinians continue to maintain that \r\nthe greatest travesty to have occurred, the grossest \r\nviolation of a sacred site and the most unforgivable \r\nprovocation was that brief visit by an Israeli politician \r\nto his people’s most holy site. \r\n I must also respond to statements made by the \r\nEgyptian representative regarding the highly publicized \r\ndeaths of Palestinian children over the course of the \r\nrecent violence. It seems that not only does the \r\nPalestinian Authority deplorably seek to capitalize on \r\nthese deaths to win international sympathy and \r\nadvance its political objectives, but it seems to be \r\ndeliberately obscuring attempts to ask one significant \r\nquestion: What were these children doing in the line of \r\nfire in the first place? \r\n It is sickening to hear various Arab spokesmen \r\nstressing how many children have been killed by Israel, \r\nas if to say that each child lost is actually a victory for \r\nthe struggle. It need hardly be mentioned that such \r\nactivity is in blatant violation of international laws and \r\naccepted norms of conduct. This is not only an affront \r\nto Israel but an affront to ethical humanity as a whole \r\nand should roundly be condemned by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Mr. Darwish (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It would \r\nseem that I was not understood because I spoke in \r\nEnglish. But I think I was clear. The representative of \r\nIsrael, as usual, again is distorting facts and getting \r\nthings mixed up. He speaks of religion and then \r\naccuses others of speaking of it. That is nothing new. \r\n The Egyptian delegation recalled two paragraphs \r\nof the resolution that was adopted by the last \r\nConference of Presiding Officers of National \r\nParliaments by a majority of 1,000 parliamentarians \r\nfrom all over the world, representing all cultures. The \r\ntwo paragraphs in question explicitly recalled the name \r\nof the Israeli official just referred to by the \r\nrepresentative of Israel, and we all recognize that the \r\ncause of the violence was the provocative visit made to \r\nAl-Haram Al-Sharif. This was recognized by the \r\ninternational community and is not something being \r\nsaid by Egypt. \r\n \r\n 23 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.55\r\n It is unfortunate that the representative of Israel \r\ndid not read the resolution of the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion. He has mixed things up and distorted the facts. \r\nOf course, these are counter-truths, as I said in English. \r\n The President: We have concluded this stage of \r\nour consideration of agenda item 26. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 \r\n \r\n \r\nOrganization of work of the fifty-fifth session \r\n \r\n The President: I should like to consult the \r\nrepresentatives regarding an extension for the work of \r\nthe Fourth Committee. \r\n Members will recall that at its ninth plenary \r\nmeeting on 11 September 2000 the General Assembly \r\napproved the recommendation of the General \r\nCommittee that the Special Political and \r\n \r\nDecolonization Committee, the Fourth Committee, \r\nwould complete its work by Thursday, 9 November \r\n2000. However, I have been informed by the Chairman \r\nof the Special Political and Decolonization Committee \r\nthat the Committee will not be able to finish its work \r\nby Thursday, 9 November 2000. \r\n It is my understanding that the Committee would \r\nneed to meet until Friday, 17 November 2000. May I \r\ntherefore take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nextend the work of the Committee until Friday, 17 \r\nNovember 2000? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\n The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
