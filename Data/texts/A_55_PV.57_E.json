Of the 44 least \r\ndeveloped countries, 33 are in Africa. Almost half of \r\nthe world’s refugees and internally displaced persons \r\nare in Africa. Indeed, Africa is the only region where \r\nconflicts are increasing. There were more than 34 \r\nmillion people living with HIV/AIDS in the world as \r\nof the end of 1999, of which 24 million were in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. This is a reality that we must face. \r\n Mr. Dangue Réwaka (Gabon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n Many important points are covered in the report. \r\nOn this occasion, I would like to focus on the issues of \r\ngood governance, trade and foreign direct investment, \r\ninformation and communication technology, regional \r\nintegration and HIV/AIDS. \r\n My Government would like to stress how \r\nimportant it is for African countries to summon the \r\npolitical will to promote good governance by ensuring \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law, and by strengthening \r\ntransparent and accountable public administration and \r\nthe capacity to maintain it. \r\n The re-emergence of armed conflicts in some \r\nregions of Africa and the negative impact of these \r\nconflicts on national and international efforts to \r\npromote economic and social development are \r\nalarming. Rapid population growth, unequal access to \r\nresources and opportunities and unequal participation \r\nin national decision-making are among the root causes \r\nof armed conflict. Good governance in African \r\nsocieties is central to addressing priority issues \r\nadequately. \r\n African countries have not sufficiently shared in \r\nthe opportunities for international trade and foreign \r\ndirect investment offered by the world economy. \r\nAfrican exports of goods have grown by an average of \r\n2 per cent per year, compared to a world average of \r\n7 per cent. The share of African exports decreased from \r\n5.9 per cent of world exports in 1980 to 3 per cent in \r\n1990 and 2.3 per cent in 1996. \r\n \r\n2  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\n My Government believes that in the increasingly \r\nglobalized world, trade and foreign direct investment \r\npresent enormous opportunities for Africa. Aid is no \r\nsubstitute for trade. The multilateral trading system \r\nmust therefore be responsive to the development \r\naspirations of Africa. The international community \r\nshould support the efforts of African countries to \r\nidentify and upgrade African products with export \r\npotential. \r\n Japan would like African countries to pay closer \r\nattention to the new opportunities that could be opened \r\nup by creating better conditions for foreign direct \r\ninvestment. Foreign direct investment could enable \r\nAfrican countries, among other things, to tap into the \r\nlarge pool of expatriate expertise, which will help to \r\nfill the human-resource gaps in Africa. \r\n My delegation believes that information and \r\ncommunication technology offer African countries an \r\nunprecedented chance to hasten their development. On \r\nthe other hand, those countries in which most people \r\nlive without access to information technology cannot \r\nfully participate in the new global society. Accordingly, \r\nthe digital divide must be addressed before it is too \r\nlate. Bilateral aid donors, as well as international \r\norganizations, should be encouraged to devise ways \r\nand means of giving the people of Africa greater access \r\nto information and communication technology. \r\n Prior to the Okinawa G-8 Summit, Japan declared \r\nthat it would prepare a comprehensive cooperation \r\npackage for bridging the digital divide with a view to \r\nproviding a total of $15 billion over the next five years. \r\nIn implementing this package, Japan will collaborate \r\nwith the United Nations system, including the United \r\nNations Development Programme, the World Bank, the \r\nInternational Telecommunications Union and other \r\nrelevant international organizations. \r\n African countries and their development partners \r\nshould recognize the importance of regional \r\ncooperation for liberalizing trade; developing physical \r\ninfrastructure and institutions, including regional \r\ncapital markets and research institutions; tackling \r\nHIV/AIDS; and preventing, managing and resolving \r\nconflicts. More specifically, in an increasingly \r\nintegrated world, subregional and regional integration \r\nprovide higher visibility to global investors, promote \r\ncross-border trade and investment, and reduce \r\nproduction and marketing costs. \r\n Due to their proximity to the field, regional and \r\nsubregional organizations may have a comparative \r\nadvantage over global organizations in terms of their \r\nbetter understanding of the issues and their context, as \r\nwell as in their greater ability to fine-tune measures \r\nand mechanisms. Thus, they are preferred channels for \r\nthe design and implementation of measures for conflict \r\nprevention, management and resolution. This is the \r\nreason why external support is so important for \r\nbuilding and strengthening the capacity of regional and \r\nsubregional institutions and for further implementing \r\nthe programmes of African subregional economic \r\ngroups. \r\n HIV/AIDS is not merely a health issue; it also \r\nimpedes the development of developing countries. \r\nGovernments and the United Nations system should \r\nactively promote the incorporation of a broad-based \r\napproach to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in all policies and \r\nprogrammes relating to development. Fighting \r\nHIV/AIDS should be a central part of the development \r\nprogrammes of developing countries, particularly in \r\nthe efforts for poverty reduction. \r\n On the occasion of the G-8 Okinawa Summit, the \r\nGovernment of Japan launched the Okinawa Infectious \r\nDiseases Initiative, under which Japan will target a \r\ntotal of $3 billion to be allocated over the next five \r\nyears to enhance assistance for measures to combat \r\nHIV/AIDS and other infectious and parasitic diseases. \r\nAs a follow-up to the G-8 Okinawa Summit, the \r\nGovernment of Japan is now preparing a conference \r\nfor December in Okinawa, the aim of which is to \r\nactualize the commitment made by G-8 leaders in order \r\nto establish a new partnership to fight the major \r\ninfectious diseases — namely, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis \r\nand malaria. It is sincerely hoped that that conference \r\nwill contribute to our efforts against HIV/AIDS. Also, \r\nJapan, along with the Joint United Nations Programme \r\non HIV/AIDS, co-hosted in Tokyo earlier this month \r\nthe second seminar on the development of health and \r\nmedical services for Africa, as a part of the follow-up \r\nof the Second Tokyo International Conference on \r\nAfrican Development. At the seminar, participants \r\nfrom African, Asian and Latin American countries \r\ndiscussed ways to enhance South-South cooperation \r\nagainst HIV/AIDS in Africa. They adopted the \r\nsummary of the seminar, which is expected to make a \r\ncontribution to the international conference in \r\nOkinawa. Also, Japan is currently preparing for a \r\nministerial meeting on African development to be held \r\n \r\n 3 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nin the fiscal year 2001, as announced by Foreign \r\nMinister Yohei Kono in his speech to the General \r\nAssembly this September. \r\n While certain progress has been made in \r\nimplementing UN-NADAF, much remains to be done. \r\nIn the final review, what has been achieved so far and \r\nwhat has not should be carefully analysed. Japan has \r\nbeen trying to realize the goals and objectives of UN-\r\nNADAF through the process of the Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development (TICAD). TICAD \r\nhas much in common with UN-NADAF in that both \r\nstress poverty eradication through accelerated \r\neconomic growth, the economic integration of Africa \r\ninto the world economy, economic diversification and \r\nhuman resources development. \r\n Finally, Japan remains committed to working \r\ntogether with African countries, as well as with the \r\nUnited Nations, in efforts to build a prosperous \r\ncontinent free from want and fear, by realizing the \r\nobjectives of UN-NADAF. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): Brazil welcomes the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development \r\nof Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). First of all, I \r\nwish to highlight the need to establish follow-up \r\nmechanisms and frameworks to ensure the consistency \r\nof ongoing initiatives for the promotion of peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa. \r\n Brazil shares the view that effective responses to \r\nAfrica’s problems can be achieved only through \r\ncoordinated efforts of the international community and \r\nthe mobilization of political will, both in Africa and \r\nbeyond its borders. As we know, in response to the \r\ndevelopment challenges faced by the African continent, \r\nin December 1991 the General Assembly adopted the \r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the \r\n1990s as a framework of consensus and partnership \r\nbetween Africa and the international community. We \r\nregret, however, that progress has been limited in the \r\nimplementation of the New Agenda. Foreign direct \r\ninvestment in Africa remains minimal and concentrated \r\nin a few areas, while official development assistance \r\ncontinues to decline. Economic insecurity and \r\ninadequate financial support continue to aggravate the \r\nsituation of the majority of African countries. \r\nStructural adjustment, which has led to the recovery of \r\nsome macroeconomic indicators, has not been \r\nsufficient to set African countries on the road to \r\nsustainable development. As the Secretary-General \r\ncorrectly pointed out in his report, while there has been \r\nsome progress in resolving the debt crisis, this has been \r\nless visible in low-income countries where external \r\ndebt service claims nearly one fifth of average savings. \r\n New problems have affected the continent, such \r\nas that of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In sum, the \r\nmobilization of resources to promote peace, stability \r\nand sustainable development in Africa requires a much \r\nhigher degree of international financial cooperation \r\nand greater commitment by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The international community plays a crucial role \r\nin addressing the challenges faced by African countries \r\nin their development process, as well as in translating \r\ncommitments into concrete actions. The Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, for \r\ninstance, should be strengthened and broadened so as \r\nto benefit more countries. Brazil is making very \r\nimportant efforts to contribute to the HIPC process. So \r\nfar, our costs related to bilateral debt relief to the \r\ncountries that have already qualified for assistance \r\nhave amounted to more than $300 million. Brazil also \r\nparticipates in the funding of the International \r\nMonetary Fund’s additional HIPC costs. \r\n We urge Member States to respond creatively to \r\nthe positive developments in Africa and to react to the \r\nless positive ones through a constructive and attentive \r\ndialogue. The objective of such a dialogue should not \r\nbe to impose conclusions unilaterally arrived at, but to \r\nassist Africans, when such assistance is required, to \r\ncome up with appropriate solutions and make them \r\nwork. Technical assistance, for instance, cannot be \r\nsupply-oriented, but must be targeted at the specific \r\nneeds of the recipient countries and should make full \r\nuse of their resources and potentialities. On the other \r\nhand, in order to make a difference for Africa in areas \r\nsuch as trade, finance, technical cooperation and \r\ncapacity-building, the United Nations must continue to \r\nimplement specific assistance initiatives and forge a \r\ncloser relationship at all levels with relevant regional \r\norganizations and the Bretton Woods institutions.  \r\n The achievement of priority development \r\nobjectives, however, goes far beyond institutional \r\narrangements in the United Nations system and \r\ndepends ultimately on the political will of Member \r\nStates to strengthen their cooperation with Africa. \r\n \r\n4  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\n I wish to stress the importance of South-South \r\ncooperation to the development of Africa. The \r\nstrengthening of technical cooperation among \r\ndeveloping countries can contribute significantly to the \r\nmobilization of resources and to the promotion of \r\nsustainable development in Africa. Despite its limited \r\nresources, Brazil has a long-standing record of \r\ncooperation with Africa and has been deploying efforts, \r\nthrough the Brazilian Cooperation Agency and other \r\nnational institutions, to share with Africa its own \r\nexperience in struggling for development. \r\n A large portion of Brazilian technical cooperation \r\nprojects with developing countries are channeled to \r\nAfrican countries in a number of strategic areas, such \r\nas capacity-building and training of experts, health, \r\nbasic education programmes, management of \r\nagricultural policies, tropical agriculture, electric \r\npower generation and monitoring and exploration of \r\nmineral resources. \r\n In the field of the fight against HIV/AIDS, for \r\nexample, since 1997 Brazil has carried out cooperation \r\nprogrammes with Portuguese-speaking countries in the \r\nareas of the management of preventive programmes \r\nand the establishment of epidemiological monitoring \r\nsystems. This cooperation, which is based on our own \r\nnational experience, is now being extended to other \r\ncountries in Africa. Last year, experts of the Brazilian \r\nMinistry of Health visited Kenya, Zimbabwe, South \r\nAfrica, Namibia and Botswana in order to identify \r\ncooperation projects. \r\n The dialogue between subregional integration \r\nprocesses is another example of cooperation. \r\nEnhancing external trade with other partners, including \r\ndeveloping countries, has been one of the main \r\nobjectives of the Southern Common Market \r\n(MERCOSUR). We attach great importance to \r\nfurthering a dialogue between MERCOSUR and the \r\nintegration processes in Africa. We have already taken \r\ninitial steps in this direction with the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community. \r\n Another modality of cooperation to be explored \r\nmight encompass trilateral schemes involving an \r\nAfrican country, Brazil and a third country or \r\ninternational organization. For example, initiatives in \r\nthe field of agriculture and health might be taken with \r\nthe cooperation of the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations, the World Health \r\nOrganization or the United Nations Children’s Fund. At \r\nthe international level, Brazil and African countries \r\nhave been working together in such organizations as \r\nthe International Coffee Organization, the International \r\nCocoa Organization and the Common Fund for \r\nCommodities. \r\n As far as conflict resolution is concerned, Brazil \r\ncontinues to provide political and material support to \r\nAfrica, as illustrated by its participation in the United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in Angola and \r\nMozambique and its contribution to the negotiation of \r\na ceasefire in Guinea-Bissau.  \r\n Regarding the need for a coordinated approach to \r\nhumanitarian assistance, we believe that appropriate \r\nmechanisms for efficient coordination within the \r\nUnited Nations system should be developed, taking \r\ninto account that several United Nations organs are \r\nresponsible for addressing humanitarian problems. \r\n A peaceful, stable and prosperous Africa is a \r\ncrucial element of world stability. It is true that, in \r\nrecent years, some unfortunate events have led us to \r\nfear that Africa was bound to fail as a continent of \r\npeace and prosperity, a sentiment that has been called \r\n“Afro-pessimism”. Nevertheless, Africa need not be \r\ndefined as a continent immersed in conflict. As is \r\nwidely recognized, there are many parts of Africa \r\nwhere peace and economic growth are taking root. \r\nThrough the adoption of the United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration, all Member States \r\nacknowledged the special needs of Africa and pledged \r\nto assist Africans in their struggle for lasting peace, \r\npoverty eradication and sustainable development. The \r\neffective implementation of such commitments calls \r\nfor a strategic partnership between Africa and the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Brazil remains determined to work for the \r\neconomic development of African countries and hopes \r\nthat the international community will strengthen its \r\nassistance to the region and thereby contribute to the \r\nfull realization of the fundamental rights of Africans. \r\n Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): It is good to see you \r\nin the chair today, Sir. It makes me want to practice my \r\nFrench, but I will not. \r\n We meet today to evaluate the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development \r\nof Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). Before us are \r\ntwo very useful reports by the Secretary-General, \r\naimed at assisting us in this review. My delegation \r\n \r\n 5 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nwishes to thank the Secretary-General for a very \r\nthorough report and addendum providing a most useful \r\noverview of the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the mid-term review of this \r\nimportant Agenda. The reports also contain interesting \r\nproposals for further implementation, which need \r\nserious consideration. \r\n The addendum on resource flows to Africa makes \r\nrather sad reading, as it highlights the deteriorating \r\nsituation in Africa in the recent past. The decrease in \r\ndomestic savings rates; the continuing flight of capital \r\nfrom the continent, which has reached a staggering \r\nestimated total of $350 billion; the drop of more than \r\n50 per cent in official development assistance flows \r\ninto the continent in the six-year period from 1992 to \r\n1998; the persistently low and decreasing foreign direct \r\ninvestment flows into Africa; the deterioration in terms \r\nof trade for the continent; the escalating debt burden; \r\nand the decline of the per capita income from $749 in \r\n1980 to $688 in 1998, a decline of about 9 per cent — \r\nall this paints a very bleak picture of the problems \r\nfacing our continent. \r\n All these signs seem to suggest that, once we \r\ncome to the final review of the UN-NADAF in 2002, \r\nwe will be faced with an even greater challenge than \r\nwe had at the beginning of the Agenda. We risk the \r\nprospect of a tragic confirmation that Africa’s \r\neconomic and financial situation has worsened in the \r\ndecade that UN-NADAF has been in place. \r\n Despite these negative and depressing statistics, \r\nmy delegation believes that we Africans are at a \r\nturning point and that the future of Africa looks much \r\nbrighter. In this regard, I wish to echo the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who in his report on this item observes that  \r\n “Africa has an important opportunity for a new \r\nbeginning in the new millennium. Since \r\nindependence, never have the momentum and \r\nconditions for change been better.” \r\n(A/55/350/Add.1, para. 48) \r\n I share this optimism for a number of reasons. We \r\nAfricans have started assuming responsibility for \r\nfinding solutions to our own problems. We are ready to \r\naddress the challenges we face. There is a growing \r\nunderstanding of the particular nature of Africa’s \r\nproblems and challenges. The wide range of bilateral \r\nand multilateral initiatives bears testimony to the active \r\ninterest in addressing the particular needs of our \r\ncontinent. Already, Africa is grappling with its own \r\nproposals towards the establishment of a global \r\npartnership for the development of the continent. These \r\nproposals, by Africans for Africans, will, hopefully, be \r\nlaunched in the not-too-distant future. \r\n Africans are in the process of defining the broad \r\npriorities for our continent. We choose to call this \r\nprocess the African renaissance. First, we have \r\nconcluded that the African renaissance means the \r\nestablishment of democratic political systems which \r\nwill ensure the accomplishment of the goal that the \r\npeople must govern.  \r\n Second, the renaissance will make certain that \r\nthese systems take into account African specifics so \r\nthat, while being truly democratic and protecting \r\nhuman rights, they are nevertheless designed in ways \r\nwhich really ensure that political and peaceful means \r\ncan be used to address the competing interests of \r\ndifferent social groups in each country. \r\n Third, the renaissance will establish institutions \r\nand procedures that will enable the continent to deal \r\ncollectively with questions of democracy, peace and \r\nstability.  \r\n Fourth, it will help to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment that results in the continuous \r\nimprovement of the standard of living and the quality \r\nof life of the masses of people.  \r\n Fifth, it will qualitatively change Africa’s place in \r\nthe global economy so that it is free of the yoke of the \r\ninternational debt burden and is no longer a mere \r\nsupplier of raw materials and an importer of \r\nmanufactured goods.  \r\n Sixth, it will ensure the full emancipation of the \r\nwomen of Africa.  \r\n Seventh, it will help in successfully confronting \r\nthe scourge of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria.  \r\n Lastly, the renaissance is about protecting the \r\nenvironment of our continent and ensuring the \r\nsustainable use of our natural resources. \r\n Not surprisingly, these priorities are all included \r\nin the agenda of UN-NADAF. \r\n The final review of UN-NADAF and the \r\nconsideration of a possible successor arrangement \r\nwould have to address a number of challenges. The \r\nfirst would be to make a thorough evaluation of all the \r\n \r\n6  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\ninitiatives so far. These would not only be within the \r\nUnited Nations system, but would include other \r\nbilateral, multilateral and regional initiatives related to \r\nAfrica. This will, of course, also include initiatives \r\nemanating from our continent. \r\n Another challenge will be to consider how this \r\nreview process can be linked to the work of the Open-\r\nended Ad Hoc Working Group on the Causes of \r\nConflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and \r\nSustainable Development in Africa. The high-level \r\nsegment of the substantive session of the Economic \r\nand Social Council in 2001 must also feed into the \r\nreview process. \r\n Furthermore, consideration will have to be given \r\nto ways in which the Africa-specific elements of the \r\nmajor United Nations conferences can be brought \r\ntogether with the other initiatives for and by Africa. As \r\nour heads of State or Government said during the \r\nMillennium Summit held here in New York a few \r\nweeks ago, the problems of the new millennium require \r\ncomprehensive solutions. And we from Africa know \r\nthis truth better than many. \r\n As hopeful as we are about the future of our \r\ncontinent, we also recognize that there can be no \r\nsustainable development without peace and security. \r\nThe immediate reminder for us is the senseless war \r\nraging in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This \r\nwar consumes nine other countries, many of them our \r\nneighbours. We watch helplessly as we see very \r\nprecious resources, both human and material, being \r\nwasted in this war. \r\n The countries of southern Africa, under the \r\nleadership of President Chiluba of Zambia, came \r\ntogether more than a year ago to agree on a peace plan \r\nknown as the Lusaka Agreement, which we believed \r\nwould help bring this war to an end. Sixteen months \r\nlater, we are still waiting for the Security Council to \r\nplay its mandated role for restoring peace and security \r\nin the region. \r\n This is one reason why for us in Africa the \r\nBrahimi report is fundamental and very important in \r\nlaying the foundation for peace in Africa. If we lose the \r\nBrahimi report to the disagreements that we have, \r\nwhich my delegation believes can be overcome, the \r\nbiggest losers will be those of us in Africa. Already we \r\nhave lost much, and we cannot afford to lose even \r\nmore. \r\n One of the areas we will have to review when we \r\nnext discuss UN-NADAF will be the contribution of \r\nregional solutions to the problems we face in Africa. \r\nWe in the Southern African Development Community \r\n(SADC) have seen the fruits of our regional integration \r\nand cooperation. SADC has over the years designed a \r\nnumber of spatial development projects that bring \r\ntogether the efforts of more than one country in our \r\nregion. For example, South Africa and Mozambique \r\nhave combined to provide the physical transport, \r\ncommunication and power infrastructure as the \r\nfoundation for the development of services and \r\nmanufacturing. This is what is known as the Maputo \r\nCorridor. The joint efforts by our two countries vastly \r\nimproved the costing structure and competitiveness, \r\nthereby attracting significant foreign direct investment \r\nto the area.  \r\n Another example is the Lebombo corridor, which \r\nbrings together three countries, Swaziland, \r\nMozambique and South Africa, working together to \r\ndevelop environmentally friendly projects, including \r\nthose for attracting eco-tourism. Several neighbouring \r\ncountries, including Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana \r\nand Mozambique, joined to built a major road to \r\ntransport goods to places between the Atlantic Ocean \r\nand the Indian Ocean. More projects are in the \r\npipeline. Besides the normal economic advantages, \r\nthese projects have deepened democracy and good-\r\nneighbourliness while making development in our \r\nregion more sustainable. \r\n We in Africa are going through a difficult but \r\nvery promising period, as the Secretary-General so \r\ncorrectly pointed out in his report. We need to \r\nstrengthen the partnership between the countries of the \r\nNorth and the countries of the South, especially those \r\nof us in Africa. The problems we face cannot be \r\naddressed by Africans only. The HIV/AIDS pandemic, \r\nmalaria and other diseases require a global rather than \r\na continental solution. While we may be ready to do as \r\nmuch as we can, we hope those countries that have \r\nmore to give, especially our northern partners, will find \r\nit in their hearts and their budgets to assist.  \r\n At the next review of UN-NADAF we hope the \r\nSecretary-General will be able to report that there has \r\nbeen a change in the plight of Africa. With confidence, \r\nour leaders meeting at the Organization of African \r\nUnity summit in Algeria in 1999 declared this the \r\nAfrican century. We believe they must have known \r\n \r\n 7 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nsomething, and UN-NADAF may bear this out next \r\ntime. \r\n Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nThe item on the implementation of the United Nations \r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the \r\n1990s is of the utmost importance in the opinion of my \r\ndelegation. This is why we would like to share our \r\nviews in this debate. \r\n The prime objective of the United Nations New \r\nAgenda was to accelerate the transformation, \r\nintegration, diversification and economic growth of \r\nAfrican countries, to make them less vulnerable to \r\noutside forces, to enhance their autonomy and vigour \r\nand to ensure a lasting development process. \r\n From this standpoint, at the 1996 mid-term \r\nreview of the implementation of the New Agenda, the \r\nGeneral Assembly noted the progress that had been \r\nmade by a number of African countries in the area of \r\neconomic reforms, the adjustment process, \r\ndemocratization and the strengthening of civil society. \r\nHowever, despite all these efforts, Africa is still \r\ngrappling with serious socio-economic problems, \r\nwhich are aggravated by a set of endogenous and \r\nexogenous factors such as globalization, investments, \r\nindebtedness and so forth.  \r\n In fact, globalization, while presenting clear \r\nadvantages for the world economy and particularly for \r\nindustrialized countries, causes new problems and \r\ninvolves constraints for the African countries, which \r\nfind themselves further pushed to the sidelines. \r\n Export receipts and the survival of the majority of \r\nAfrican countries continue to depend on certain basic \r\ncommodities, whose prices as a whole have declined \r\never since 1998, thereby causing a decline in internal \r\nsavings and investment. Despite the efforts deployed \r\nby a large number of countries to improve conditions \r\nfor private investment, foreign direct investment \r\ncontinues to contribute very little to our economies. \r\n Moreover, in addition to the drastic decline in \r\nofficial development assistance, African countries’ \r\nhuge debt remains a source of great concern, since debt \r\nservicing consumes a large part of our income, to the \r\ndetriment of national investment. \r\n Other facts, such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \r\nmalaria and armed conflicts, not only cause \r\ntremendous human suffering, but also impede Africa’s \r\nsocio-economic development, since the most \r\nvulnerable sectors of our population are mainly those \r\nin the productive sectors. \r\n In the face of all these challenges, a number of \r\ninitiatives have been launched, but unfortunately they \r\nhave been weakened by the fact that many of the \r\ncommitments made by the international community \r\nunder the New Agenda have not been honoured. \r\n We appeal to the international community to \r\nadopt and implement new measures, especially to help \r\nin the struggle against poverty and to stimulate growth. \r\n Implementation of these new measures to ensure \r\nlasting development requires first a strategy having as \r\nits backbone macroeconomic stability, a secure \r\nenvironment to encourage investment, support for \r\nexport activities, adequate investment in human \r\ndevelopment sectors such as health and education, and \r\ngood governance, as well as improvement of basic \r\ninfrastructure. \r\n The key to development and the main objective \r\nof any development policy in Africa is the struggle \r\nagainst poverty. We know that poverty arises from the \r\ninteraction between population, environment and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The tragedy of Africa is, first, that population \r\ngrowth is far greater than growth in food production \r\nper capita and, secondly, that the rapid deterioration of \r\nthe environment seriously harms agricultural output. It \r\nis therefore important urgently to tackle these problems \r\nand to incorporate population, environmental and \r\nagricultural development issues in development \r\nplanning and anti-poverty policies. \r\n After the follow-up in Geneva in June to the \r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the \r\nMillennium Summit condemned the various constraints \r\non developing countries, particularly the African \r\ncountries, since, according to the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), 80 per cent of \r\ncountries with weak human resources development are \r\nin Africa and four out of ten Africans live in absolute \r\npoverty. \r\n Although African countries, those most \r\nconcerned, will have to adopt adequate and urgent \r\nmeasures to get out of this impasse, particularly by \r\nensuring good governance, it is also essential that \r\ndonors and lenders agree, without too many conditions, \r\nto help them mobilize the resources needed to finance \r\ntheir development. All eyes are therefore on the high-\r\n \r\n8  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nlevel international and intergovernmental meeting on \r\nfinancing for development, to be held in 2001. \r\n We repeat that advancing the cause of Africa \r\nmeans advancing the cause of the entire world, since in \r\nour globalized, interdependent world it is only by \r\nhelping the poorest to overcome their \r\nunderdevelopment that the better off can guarantee \r\ntheir own survival. \r\n Mr. Mesdoua (Algeria) (spoke in French): This \r\nthird debate on Africa in the space of just 10 days is of \r\nparticular importance, because it falls within the \r\nframework of the preliminary dialogue on preparation \r\nfor the final review and evaluation of implementation \r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the \r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, which will take \r\nplace in 2002. Although it would have been desirable \r\nto space out these debates a little, each has its own \r\nmerit relating to different, but nevertheless \r\ncomplementary, aspects of the situation of the \r\ncontinent which are taken up each time. \r\n At the beginning of the 1990s the New Agenda \r\nembodied the concern of the Organization and the \r\ninternational community as a whole to support Africa’s \r\ndevelopment efforts. The New Agenda, which is a true \r\nplan of action, has become a political contract \r\ncontaining responsibilities and commitments agreed by \r\nthe African States, on the one hand, and their \r\ndevelopment partners, on the other, concerning specific \r\nactions. \r\n During the mid-term review in 1996 it emerged \r\nclearly that, despite some progress in some areas, on \r\nthe whole the same conditions which had justified the \r\nlaunching of the New Agenda at the beginning of the \r\ndecade remained in place. Moreover, it was widely \r\nrecognized that for their part, despite the innumerable \r\ndifficulties and the objective limits on their resources, \r\nthe African States had made serious efforts to \r\nimplement the agreed actions and had thereby \r\nhonoured a good part of their responsibilities. That \r\nbeing so, and given the difficult prospects for the \r\ncontinent, particular measures and recommendations \r\nwere proposed by common agreement in order to \r\ncontinue and accelerate the New Agenda’s application. \r\nThus, it is with great interest that Africa looks forward \r\nto the final review in 2002. \r\n In this framework, the progress report submitted \r\nto us by the Secretary-General on implementation, \r\nincluding measures and recommendations agreed at the \r\nmid-term review in 1996, and the addendum are two \r\ndocuments full of information, analyses and proposals \r\non actions taken and/or initiated both by the African \r\nStates themselves and by the international community, \r\nin particular the United Nations system, and are \r\ntherefore a source of an enormous amount of \r\ninformation about a fundamental dimension of African \r\ndevelopment — the mobilization of financial \r\nresources. My delegation appreciates the high quality \r\nof these two documents. \r\n The General Assembly resolutions and the agreed \r\nconclusions of the Economic and Social Council \r\ncontain terms of reference which can guide the review \r\nprocess. Algeria believes that the independent review \r\nof the implementation of the New Agenda should have \r\nthe aim of drawing up a balance sheet. It would be \r\nuseful in this connection if the team responsible for the \r\nstudy included representatives of African countries and \r\ntheir development partners, both in the north and in the \r\nsouth. The United Nations system, including the \r\nEconomic Commission for Africa and the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, as \r\nwell as the Organization of African Unity (OAU), \r\nshould also be represented on this team. Civil society \r\ncould also make a useful contribution to the review. \r\n Clearly, the independent review and the final \r\nexamination of the implementation of UN-NADAF \r\nwould remain incomplete if they were not part of an \r\nongoing approach in the international community’s \r\nsupport for African development. Therefore, the \r\ndiscussion and negotiations to take place between now \r\nand 2002 should aim at developing another framework \r\nor programme of cooperation to succeed UN-NADAF. \r\n Similarly, it would be useful if they took into \r\naccount the results of the debate that the Economic and \r\nSocial Council (ECOSOC), held during the \r\ncoordination segment of its substantive session in \r\n1999, which was devoted to the implementation and \r\ncoordinated follow-up of African development \r\ninitiatives. \r\n At this stage we think it would be useful to stress \r\nthat consideration of the arrangements for a successor \r\nto UN-NADAF should be guided by the following \r\nelements. \r\n The first is an effective commitment on the part \r\nof the international community in a spirit of real \r\npartnership with Africa and respect for African \r\npriorities as defined by Africans in their national and \r\n \r\n 9 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nregional development strategies. The second element is \r\nstrengthening Africans’ sense of ownership of the \r\ncooperation activity proposed to them. Another \r\nelement is ongoing support for African capacities at the \r\nnational, subregional and regional levels in \r\ncoordinating programmes of cooperation and \r\ndevelopment assistance. \r\n Other elements include adaptation of the \r\ncooperation with the continent so that it can take on the \r\nnew priorities resulting from globalization; greater \r\ninvolvement of the Organization of African Unity and \r\ngreater attention to the main areas of work established \r\nby that organization, especially in the areas of \r\nintegration, education, health and others; the need for a \r\nserious effort to improve coordination and \r\nharmonization of the many international bilateral and \r\nmultilateral initiatives for Africa; the need for adequate \r\nidentification of the continent’s need; and the need for \r\nspecific benchmarks in the form of targeted goals or \r\nindicators and time limits for implementation. The \r\nAlgerian delegation believes these principles should be \r\nconsidered in evaluating a successor to UN-NADAF. \r\n Many international events of considerable \r\nimportance for Africa are expected before the final \r\nreview of UN-NADAF in 2002. The international \r\nconference on financing for development, the Third \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries and the special session of the General \r\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS should all bear in mind the \r\nspecific dimensions of the African situation in order to \r\nfirmly consolidate a consensus on a special effort for \r\nthe continent. \r\n Furthermore, the high-level ECOSOC segment \r\nnext year, which is to be devoted to the United Nations \r\nrole in support of efforts for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of Africa, will no doubt enrich the debate \r\nand take place within the context of developing a new \r\nframework of cooperation for the Organization to \r\nreplace UN-NADAF. Furthermore, Algeria can only \r\nwelcome the fact that African development continues \r\nto represent a priority for our Organization. \r\n At the Millennium Summit, world leaders \r\nunanimously recognized Africa’s special needs. Algeria \r\ndares hope, in this context, that the commitments \r\nmade, especially in terms of special measures to be \r\ntaken to meet challenges such as eliminating poverty \r\nand achieving sustainable development in Africa, will \r\nsoon take concrete form. \r\n In this connection, the final review of UN-\r\nNADAF in 2002 offers an opportunity of choice for the \r\nrest of the world to reflect on a real world programme \r\nof support for Africa along the lines of the Marshall \r\nPlan for a Europe that had emerged bled white at the \r\nend of the Second World War. Would it not be as fair \r\nfor Africa also to have its chance?  \r\n Therefore, Algeria calls for international \r\nmobilization for a world programme on African \r\ndevelopment, in which the United Nations would play \r\na central role. Such a programme could be called a \r\n“programme” or a “world partnership for African \r\ndevelopment” that would serve as the global \r\nframework for all existing initiatives. \r\n In recent years, many bilateral and multilateral \r\ninitiatives have been taken by Africa’s development \r\npartners in the North and the South. Africa can only \r\nwelcome this, while hoping that these initiatives will \r\nbe further strengthened and will promote a spirit of \r\nworld solidarity and effective support for our \r\ncontinent’s efforts. \r\n Mr. Doutriaux (France) (spoke in French): I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. The Central and East European countries \r\nassociated with the European Union — Bulgaria, the \r\nCzech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, \r\nPoland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the \r\nother associated countries Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, \r\nalign themselves with this statement. \r\n As the main donor of funds and principal trading \r\npartner of the African continent, the European Union \r\nattaches special importance to the success of the \r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of \r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). The African \r\ncontinent, in particular sub-Saharan Africa which \r\nincludes 33 of the 48 countries officially designated as \r\nleast developed countries, is the priority region for \r\nEuropean Union cooperation. The European Union \r\nendeavours in all international meetings to fully \r\nconsider the particular needs of Africa. It does this at \r\nthe United Nations, especially during General \r\nAssembly special sessions, as well as in international \r\nfinancial institutions. \r\n This is one of the key policy objectives of the \r\nEuropean Union, which was clearly stated at the \r\nAfrica-Europe summit held in Cairo this year. The \r\nEuropean Union welcomes the success of that \r\nconference and the adoption of a declaration and a plan \r\n \r\n10  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nof action which set guidelines for its relations with \r\nAfrica. The hosting by the European Union in Brussels \r\nof the Third United Nations Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries next year is another example of \r\nEurope’s commitment to development, particularly in \r\nAfrica. \r\n The report submitted by the Secretariat highlights \r\nthe varying results achieved in the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development \r\nof Africa. On the one hand, it shows what we have \r\nachieved in terms of resumed economic growth, the \r\nongoing re-establishment of the major macroeconomic \r\nbalances, efforts to establish sound economic policies \r\nand structural reforms and real progress on the \r\ndemocratization front. \r\n On the other hand, however, the report shows the \r\nenormous challenge that remains to be met, with 51 per \r\ncent of the sub-Saharan African population living in \r\nabsolute poverty, insufficient agricultural and food \r\nproduction, lack of progress in diversifying economies, \r\ninsufficient integration into the world economy and, \r\nfinally, the persistently weak social indicators \r\nthreatened by the rapid spread of AIDS. It is crucial \r\nthat the African countries take the measures necessary \r\nto fight this scourge; have been positive results in this \r\nregard, as the examples of Senegal and Uganda have \r\ndemonstrated. \r\n The international community must support their \r\nefforts, including by mobilizing the additional \r\nresources that are required. The European Union \r\nwelcomes the fact that the fight against AIDS has \r\nbecome a top priority for United Nations agencies. It \r\nwill continue to support action in that area, in \r\nparticular through the Joint United Nations Programme \r\non HIV/AIDS. It will also continue its efforts to \r\nstrengthen health systems, including the fight against \r\nother infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria. \r\n The European Union continues strongly to favour \r\nthe formulation of an integrated United Nations \r\napproach to African development which also takes \r\naccount of the political, economic and social \r\ndimensions of conflict prevention and conflict \r\nresolution. The European Union would point out that \r\n20 of the 38 poorest countries in the world are still \r\nembroiled in or are only just emerging from conflict. \r\nThe coming of peace is not in itself enough to eradicate \r\npoverty. But there can be no real progress in the fight \r\nagainst poverty without sustainable peace. \r\n In that connection, the European Union is greatly \r\nconcerned at the proliferation or recurrence of conflict \r\nin West Africa, in the Great Lakes region and in \r\nsouthern Africa. Not only do such conflicts, inter alia \r\nthrough the concomitant illegal exploitation of natural \r\nwealth, deflect the financial resources of African \r\ncountries and of the chief contributors from \r\ndevelopment to the peacekeeping operations budget, \r\nbut they also threaten to do permanent damage to \r\nefforts at regional integration, and ultimately to \r\ndestabilize entire subregions, undermining the \r\ndevelopment efforts of all the surrounding States. The \r\nEuropean Union therefore supports United Nations \r\nendeavours in the sphere of conflict prevention and \r\nconflict resolution, whether in the form of support for \r\nregional peace and security efforts, mediation attempts \r\nor a better understanding of the economic and \r\ncommercial aspects of particular African crises. \r\n The report submitted by the Secretariat pinpoints \r\nthe difficulties faced by the African continent in \r\nmobilizing financial resources and in using them \r\neffectively for its development. The report also \r\nhighlights the extent of the African continent’s needs. \r\nWhile recognizing the shortage of domestic resources \r\nwhich can be mobilized in the countries concerned, the \r\nEuropean Union would again stress the importance of \r\ndeveloping countries themselves creating an \r\nenvironment that is favourable to development by \r\nencouraging the rule of law, human rights and good \r\ngovernance, inter alia through the setting up of reliable \r\nand effective systems of taxation. It goes without \r\nsaying that the resources mobilized in that way must be \r\nchannelled into satisfying the basic social needs of the \r\npeople, especially the most vulnerable groups, without \r\nethnic, religious or gender discrimination. The creation \r\nof a favourable environment is moreover a means for \r\nAfrican countries to assume responsibility for the \r\nmeasures decided upon to help them; that is an \r\nessential condition for the success of such measures. \r\n The European Union acknowledges the vital role \r\nof funds and programmes and of the World Bank and \r\nthe regional development banks in reducing poverty. It \r\ncalls for concessional funds to be targeted at the \r\npoorest countries, which have only limited access to \r\nfinancial markets, and most of which are in Africa, so \r\nthat the requisite basic infrastructures can be developed \r\nthere. It considers that policies to combat poverty and \r\n \r\n 11 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\ninequality must be at the centre of economic reforms. \r\nThey must be more than just safety nets to cushion the \r\nimpact of adjustment policies. \r\n Official development assistance (ODA) must \r\ncomplement the mobilization of national resources and \r\nmust play an essential role of catalyst for the \r\nchannelling of private funds and direct international \r\nfunding to developing countries. It is vital that the flow \r\nof foreign direct investment to Africa be increased. The \r\nSecretariat report highlights the fact that in 1999 Africa \r\nattracted a mere 4.5 per cent of total foreign direct \r\ninvestment in developing countries. \r\n On the debt issue, the European Union expressed \r\nits position during the debate on that item in the \r\nSecond Committee. The Union confirmed in particular \r\nthat it considers the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative to be a key element in \r\nfighting poverty and achieving the objective of the \r\nsustainable development of developing countries. It \r\nfully supports that Initiative. The European Union calls \r\non eligible countries to take the requisite political and \r\neconomic measures to join the process. It also urges \r\ncreditor countries which have not yet done so to \r\ncontribute to the funding of the enlarged HIPC \r\nInitiative so that the burden can be shared equitably. \r\nThe European Union will see to it that the financial \r\ncontribution to the Initiative is not to the detriment of \r\nother ODA channels. \r\n To conclude on the issue of financing, the \r\nEuropean Union confirms that it attaches great \r\nimportance to the High-level International \r\nIntergovernmental Event on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, to be held in 2001. It must provide an \r\nopportunity to campaign for better mobilization of \r\nnational and international resources for development, \r\nand to help achieve greater consistency in policies. \r\n Access by African countries to the markets of the \r\ndeveloped countries is an important aspect of their \r\neconomic development. Here, the European Union \r\nregards Africa’s integration into the world economy as \r\nparticularly important. The Union has opened its \r\nmarket wide to products from African countries and \r\nintends to go even further in that direction. The Union \r\nwas the driving force behind a World Trade \r\nOrganization initiative to guarantee duty-free and \r\nquota-free access for exports from least developed \r\ncountries. The European Union is prepared to work for \r\nfurther progress in eliminating customs duties and \r\nquotas, a major effort which we hope might be \r\nfollowed by other countries. The Union extends a \r\ngeneral invitation to the other industrialized nations to \r\nfollow its lead in opening up trade to manufactured \r\nproducts from African countries. \r\n Regional integration too could be an effective \r\nfactor for the economic development of Africa, \r\nconsidering that many African countries have, as the \r\nreport notes, internal markets of limited scale. The \r\nEuropean Union supports the promotion of regional \r\nintegration, which could also be an instrument for \r\ncoordinating and harmonizing a broad range of sectoral \r\npolicies, and which is also an indispensable means of \r\ncombating natural disasters. The European Union will \r\ncontinue actively to support the various regional \r\nintegration initiatives and United Nations programmes \r\nhelping to set up unified structures within the \r\ncontinent. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to reiterate the \r\nfundamental importance for the European Union of a \r\ncomprehensive and integrated approach to African \r\ndevelopment which would take account both of \r\npolitical and economic aspects and of the social and \r\nenvironmental dimensions of sustainable human \r\ndevelopment. That is the approach of the recent \r\nCotonou agreement between the African, Caribbean \r\nand Pacific (ACP) States and the European Union, \r\nwhich focuses on the objective of reducing poverty in a \r\nway consistent with the objectives of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the gradual integration of the ACP \r\ncountries into the world economy. \r\n Such a global and integrated approach calls for \r\ncoordination based on existing processes such as the \r\nComprehensive Development Framework, the poverty \r\nreduction strategy paper and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Assistance Framework. \r\n Mr. Malhotra (India): I compliment the \r\nSecretary-General on the comprehensive nature and the \r\nthought-provoking quality of the report (A/55/350 and \r\nA/55/350/Add.1) before us. We have read those \r\ndocuments with great interest and believe that the \r\nthorough examination and implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained therein would certainly \r\ncontribute to the realization of the resolve of our heads \r\nof State or Government at the Millennium Summit to \r\nmeet the special needs of Africa. \r\n During discussions on this agenda item at the \r\nfifty-third session, my delegation pointed out that the \r\n \r\n12  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nbest of intentions and goodwill have to be matched by \r\nthe provision of adequate resources that are not only \r\nsufficient for the implementation of the United Nations \r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the \r\n1990s (UN-NADAF) but that will lead to a growth rate \r\nin gross domestic product of at least 8 per cent per \r\nannum, which is judged to be the minimum required \r\nfor an effective fight against poverty in the African \r\ncontinent. We then fully concurred with the views of \r\nthe Secretary-General, expressed in his progress report \r\n(A/53/390), that one of the critical issues hindering the \r\nimplementation of the New Agenda related to \r\nimpediments encountered in increasing financial flows \r\nto the countries of Africa. We note from paragraph 165 \r\nof the present report (A/55/350) that effective \r\nmobilization of financial resources, despite often-\r\nexpressed political resolve, remains a critical \r\ndevelopment challenge for the African region. Given \r\nthe critical importance of this issue, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has presented to us an addendum concentrating \r\nexclusively on the mobilization of additional resources \r\nfor African development. \r\n The picture, as outlined in the addendum, is \r\nbleak: inflows have been largely offset by outflows; \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) to Africa has \r\nbeen falling by about 20 per cent in real terms since the \r\nadvent of the New Agenda for the Development of \r\nAfrica; and, most importantly, the perceived \r\nintegration of African countries into the globalized \r\nmarket place appears to be becoming a curse, with \r\nAfrica’s loss of market share in its exports over the \r\nperiod 1970-1997 representing a staggering annual \r\nincome loss of $68 billion — almost 20 per cent of its \r\ngross domestic product.  \r\n The report correctly points out that, in \r\ncomparison with those of the 1980s, recent trends \r\nindicate a worsening of aggregate resource flows to \r\nAfrica. It furthermore makes the absolutely valid and \r\ncrucial point that ODA and other external resource \r\ninflows are falling precisely when the need is \r\ngreatest — when the African countries have undertaken \r\nvaliant economic reforms and achieved considerable \r\nprogress with regard to the promotion of the private \r\nsector, the intensification of democratization processes, \r\nthe strengthening of civil society institutions and in \r\nother areas. It is clear that productivity per dollar of \r\nODA in Africa has increased considerably through \r\nthese efforts made by African countries, but it is \r\nsaddening that the increase in efficiency in the \r\nutilization of external assistance should be matched not \r\nby enhanced commitments, but by reduced inflows. \r\n Africa is perhaps the only region in the world \r\nwhere per capita income in 1998 was lower than it was \r\n1980 — $688, as compared with $749; and it is the \r\nonly region where poverty is projected to increase in \r\nthe next decade. A sustainable reduction in poverty can \r\nbe ensured only through the promotion of sustained \r\nand broad-based income growth. It has been estimated \r\nthat to achieve the required growth rates, investment \r\nrates of at least 30 per cent to 40 per cent of gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) per annum would be required \r\nfor sub-Saharan African countries. Given the average \r\nsavings rate of 13 per cent during the 1990s — or even \r\nthe current domestic savings rate of about 18 per \r\ncent — they face a significant resource gap of at least \r\n22 per cent to 27 per cent per annum. This gap must be \r\nfilled by external financial resources.  \r\n We noted from the report that the average \r\nnational savings rate of 15.8 per cent for the period \r\n1996-1998 was small in comparison with Africa’s \r\nhistorical peak performance of 28.4 per cent, in the \r\n1980s. But, as the report itself points out, and as my \r\ndelegation said two years ago, there can hardly be any \r\nsavings at subsistence levels without squeezing \r\nconsumption. Furthermore, even in the face of \r\ndifficulties, the savings rate is depleted by capital \r\nflight, which remains pervasive and severe, and by the \r\nnet transfer of resources abroad in the form of net \r\nfactor income less public grants. \r\n These structural impediments could have been \r\novercome had the international community been \r\nresponsive to the needs of Africa. But, as the \r\nSecretary-General states in document A/55/350/Add.1, \r\nin terms of quantity, reliability and effectiveness, \r\nexternal finance has been disappointing. The inflow of \r\ncapital to African countries has steadily declined from \r\n$28.2 billion in 1995 to $20.8 billion in 1996 and to \r\n$17.1 billion in 1998 — a fall of over a third in three \r\nyears. The fall in ODA from $19.7 billion in 1992 to \r\n$9.7 billion in 1998 — a reduction of more than one \r\nhalf in six years — is even more disturbing. The fall \r\nhas been dramatic, especially when we consider the \r\npromises that were made and the expectations \r\ngenerated when we estimated that ODA should \r\nincrease by 4 per cent per annum in real terms in the \r\n1990s. Instead of an increase, there has been a 24 per \r\ncent decline in real terms — an average annual decline \r\nduring the past 10 years of 2.4 per cent per annum. \r\n \r\n 13 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\n The reason for this decline is implicit in \r\nparagraph 25 of the report in document \r\nA/55/350/Add.l. As the Secretary-General states in that \r\nparagraph, “In reality, development is but one of the \r\nmultiple objectives served by aid.”  \r\n The end of the cold war did not produce a peace \r\ndividend simply because many African countries and, \r\nindeed, other developing countries, lost their strategic \r\nappeal. Another problem is that foreign technical \r\nassistance absorbs over 25 per cent of ODA. The more \r\nthan 100,000 foreign experts in Africa cost about $4 \r\nbillion per annum and represent a major leakage of aid \r\nresources. The multiplicity of donors, with their \r\ndiffering requirements, also weakens African \r\ncapacities, as the new parallel aid economy attracts the \r\nmore skilled civil servants with higher salaries while \r\nthe remaining civil servants spend more than 50 per \r\ncent of their time dealing with a myriad of donors. \r\nMuch of the aid delivery bypasses national budget \r\nprocesses and weakens the accountability of \r\ndemocratically elected leaders to their own people. \r\n Some of the suggestions put forward by the \r\nSecretary-General deserve our immediate and urgent \r\nconsideration. Two of them, which could have a critical \r\ninfluence, are the complete and full untying of aid and \r\nensuring that technical assistance is used for capacity-\r\nbuilding — taking our cue from the aid recipient, \r\nwhich must be in the driver’s seat. Another courageous \r\nproposal of the Secretary-General, which deserves to \r\nbe fully supported, is the need to acknowledge that the \r\ncurrent system, based on altruism, has not worked well, \r\nand that the time has therefore come to institutionalize \r\naid commitments as mandatory obligations with an \r\ninstitutional mechanism to collect such resources from \r\ndeveloped countries and transfer them to needy \r\ncountries. \r\n The Secretary-General has estimated that terms-\r\nof-trade losses typically offset 70 per cent of ODA to \r\nAfrica, and exceed all inflows to Africa — ODA, \r\nforeign direct investment, private lending and portfolio \r\nflows. The international community must act in concert \r\nto ensure that market access to products and \r\nmanufactured goods from Africa is available as an \r\nintegrated element of its development process. Rising \r\nlevels of protectionism in developed country markets, \r\ntariff escalations and tariff peaks, protectionism, the \r\nfrequent and unjustified use of anti-dumping duties and \r\ncountervailing measures and non-tariff barriers to \r\nAfrican exports — and, indeed, to exports from other \r\ndeveloping countries — must be effectively removed. \r\n The issue of external debt and the problem of \r\ndebt overhang deserve urgent consideration. Many \r\nAfrican countries have become trapped in a debt cycle \r\nwhereby new aid is given to service existing debt \r\nstock. While such aid shows up as “new resources”, \r\nthat is a mere accounting adjustment, and no new \r\ndollars reach the supposed recipient. Additional \r\nresources are required — apart from ODA — to fully \r\nfinance the envisaged debt cancellation. \r\n Another important issue is that of the return of \r\ncapital squirrelled away from these countries. Capital \r\nflight remains pervasive and at the end of the 1990s \r\nwas estimated at about $350 billion — about the size \r\nof Africa’s external debt stock. The situation is \r\ncomplicated by the unwillingness of the foreign \r\nGovernments in whose banks lies the preponderant \r\nportion of these massive amounts to make efforts to \r\nreturn this capital to those to whom it rightly belongs: \r\nthe people of Africa. Africa urgently and desperately \r\nneeds these funds, not only for development, but also \r\nto further its efforts to staunch corruption. \r\n We are convinced that, if we can achieve the \r\nmobilization of the required financial resources, \r\nAfrican countries will make even greater progress. We \r\ncommend the people of Africa and their leaders for the \r\nsignificant gains outlined in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, even though the external economic \r\nenvironment remained unfavourable to them. This is a \r\npredicament that we and other developing countries \r\nshare and empathize with. \r\n India has always attached the highest priority to \r\nits cooperation with Africa. Within our resource \r\nconstraints, we are committed to contributing to \r\ncapacity-building through expanded technical \r\ncooperation with the countries of Africa. More than 60 \r\nper cent of nearly 1,500 training slots every year in our \r\nbest institutions, in diverse fields ranging from \r\nbanking, foreign trade, hydrology and water resources, \r\ncommunications, electronics, satellite, agriculture, \r\nsmall and medium industry, software, renewable \r\nenergy and the like, are reserved for nominees from \r\nAfrican countries. \r\n We have also implemented and initiated technical \r\nassistance and infrastructure-building projects in Africa \r\nunder our cooperation programme, including upgrading \r\nof hospitals, establishment of rural health centres, \r\n \r\n14  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nestablishment of demonstration farms to promote \r\nagricultural sufficiency, establishment of solar energy \r\nlighting systems, manufacturing plants for poultry \r\nvaccines, entrepreneur development centres, \r\nmechanical training workshops, information \r\ntechnology training centres, and so on. \r\n Cooperation between the private sectors of India \r\nand of African countries is also growing at a vibrant \r\npace. Several joint ventures in manufacturing sectors \r\nhave been established by Indian private-sector \r\ncompanies in Africa. In certain sectors such as \r\nrailways, Indian industry is involved in a major way in \r\nthe development of African transport infrastructure. \r\n We propose to continue further in this direction, \r\nas we believe that Africa and India are bound by ties \r\nthat reach way back into history, and that our \r\npartnership should embrace the future. We will \r\nendeavour to contribute, to the maximum extent \r\npossible within our capacities, to the efforts of African \r\ncountries towards growth and self-reliance, particularly \r\nin the area of human resource development, since, in \r\nthe true spirit of South-South solidarity, it is in their \r\nsuccess that our progress also lies. \r\n Mr. Babaa (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I should like to express my \r\ndelegation’s deep appreciation to the Secretary-General \r\nand his staff for the progress report before us on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for \r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. \r\n Consideration of this item offers the international \r\ncommunity the opportunity to increase its awareness of \r\nthe development challenges facing the African \r\ncontinent and reflects the increasing attention devoted \r\nby the world to Africa’s development and growth. It \r\nalso reaffirms the commitment made by the Member \r\nStates to support the efforts of the United Nations and \r\nits specialized agencies in the realization of that \r\nobjective. Further, it represents yet another opportunity \r\nfor Africa, in the framework of its determination to \r\nrealize sustainable development, to shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities and to rely on itself and on its peoples, \r\nas well as on the support of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n We welcome the report of the Secretary-General \r\nand reaffirm our support for the recommendations \r\ntherein. We call on the United Nations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the \r\ninternational community in its entirety, to redouble \r\ntheir initiatives to support Africa’s development \r\nefforts. We hope also that the United Nations will \r\npromote its cooperation with the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity, the African Development Bank and \r\nother specialized regional organizations, in addition to \r\nstrengthening its partnership with African NGOs at the \r\ngrass-roots level, which bear the responsibility for \r\ncoping effectively with development challenges on a \r\ndaily basis. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General contains \r\ngood news and bad news. On the one hand, the report \r\nindicates that some progress has been achieved in the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the mid-\r\nterm review since the last progress report was \r\nsubmitted to the fifty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly, particularly in the field of economic reform, \r\nthe development of the private sector, the strengthening \r\nof civil society and the promotion of economic \r\ncooperation and integration. Nevertheless, there is still \r\na need to redouble efforts in order to achieve progress \r\nin this regard. \r\n On the other hand, prospects are still gloomy in \r\nAfrica due to the intensification of the debt crisis, the \r\nspread of HIV/AIDS and the widespread persistence of \r\nabject poverty. At the same time, a sharp decrease has \r\nbeen noted in financial resources and official \r\ndevelopment assistance and in growth rates, coupled \r\nwith a considerable reduction in the prices of basic \r\ncommodities exported by the continent. Furthermore, \r\nthe continent has become increasingly marginalized in \r\nthe course of world trade and the globalization process, \r\nwhich has further intensified its problems. \r\n Africa is still the scene of armed conflicts, civil \r\nwars and natural disasters, all of which hinder its \r\ndevelopment efforts. In spite of the particular attention \r\ndevoted by the Millennium Summit to the special \r\nneeds of the continent, particularly the promotion of \r\nregional and subregional mechanisms for the \r\nprevention and settlement of conflicts, the \r\nestablishment of peace and stability and other measures \r\nneeded to face development challenges, there is still an \r\nacute need for the Organization to continue to accord \r\nthe highest priority to Africa and for the international \r\ncommunity to provide the necessary support for \r\nAfrica’s urgent needs, especially since the programme \r\nunder consideration will be concluded in two years. \r\n I should like in this regard to express our \r\nsatisfaction at the fact that light has been shed on the \r\n \r\n 15 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nurgent economic and social problems of Africa in the \r\nUnited Nations programme and in the several \r\nconferences and important events that have taken place \r\nrecently, in particular the two special meetings of the \r\nSecurity Council on HIV/AIDS and security in Africa, \r\nand other major United Nations conferences.  \r\n We believe that the United Nations strategy for \r\nthe realization of sustainable development in Africa \r\nshould focus on the following points. \r\n First, reduction of poverty, which is the greatest \r\nchallenge to Africa, and the elaboration of effective \r\nprogrammes to gradually eliminate it in that continent. \r\nPoverty leads to conflicts, and the reverse is also true. \r\nThere is a need to mobilize all African resources, and \r\nall other resources provided by its partners, in order to \r\nrealize that objective. \r\n Second, a radical solution to the debt problem is \r\nneeded, as Africa is one of the continents most affected \r\nby this problem, which hinders its economic progress. \r\nThat could be achieved through the cancelling of \r\nAfrican debt in order to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Third, immediate measures must be taken to halt \r\nthe spread of AIDS, which threatens security and \r\npolitical stability in the continent. We must devise a \r\nstrategy to guarantee the distribution of medicines at \r\nreasonable prices and launch an information campaign \r\nthat would concentrate on prevention. \r\n Fourth, a solution must be found to the problems \r\nof desertification and drought in Africa, particularly in \r\nland-locked countries, and bilateral and multilateral \r\nassistance must be provided to the affected States in an \r\neffort to achieve water security in the continent. \r\n Fifthly, necessary support must be provided to \r\nAfrica so that it can manage its natural resources, \r\nstrike a balance between population growth and \r\neconomic growth, and study how to diversify its \r\neconomies so that progress can be made in \r\nmanufacturing African commodities. \r\n Sixthly, priority must be given to the agricultural \r\nsector in order to develop the agricultural and rural \r\nareas, concentrating on the role of women in rural \r\nareas and on using modern techniques that are \r\nsustainable and that will help preserve the environment \r\nand provide food security. This in turn would lead to a \r\nreduction in the costs of importing foodstuffs. \r\n Seventhly, Africa’s share of global trade needs to \r\nbe enhanced by means of fair and reasonable prices for \r\nits commodities. Africa should also be allowed to take \r\nits due position in the world and in the decision-\r\nmaking process in the economic and political fields. \r\n During the last decade there were several United \r\nNations conferences — from Rio to Cairo, from \r\nCopenhagen to Beijing — all of which reflected an \r\ninternational consensus on the need to support Africa \r\nand to meet its urgent development needs. Also in the \r\nlast few years increasing attention has been paid to \r\nAfrica by various international and regional entities. \r\nThere were a series of conferences of the francophone \r\ncountries, meetings in Tokyo, exchanges of views and \r\nthe summit in Cairo last April — which for the first \r\ntime included European and African leaders, who \r\nfocused on promoting cooperation between the two \r\ncontinents. Finally, there was a ministerial meeting \r\nbetween the Chinese and the Africans in Beijing that \r\ndealt with activating cooperation between South-South \r\ncountries and with the need for globalization to \r\nadvance the interests of all nations and peoples. \r\n If we truly wish to develop Africa, the great \r\nPowers should stop exploiting its wealth and resources \r\nat reduced prices and should cease interfering in the \r\ncontinent’s internal affairs. If the international \r\ncommunity has accepted the principle of compensation \r\nfor some past crimes, why does it not require the \r\ncolonial Powers to compensate the peoples and \r\ncountries of Africa for committing the greatest crime in \r\nhistory — colonization and enslavement? The African \r\npeople should be compensated for all the destruction \r\nand usurpation to which they were subjected during the \r\ncolonial era. \r\n This gloomy picture of Africa will gradually \r\nchange. The new African generation is growing and \r\nbecoming greater. It is showing a marked \r\ndetermination to make progress and develop. African \r\nleaders and experts continue their efforts, in spite of all \r\nthe difficulties they are facing and in spite of all \r\nattempts to marginalize their continent. They are \r\ncooperating to solve their domestic problems and \r\nconflicts, to unite and regain their political and \r\neconomic clout, to make their voices heard and to \r\nallow their continent to gain its rightful place on the \r\nnew globalized map of the world. \r\n Not a single day passes without an initiative for \r\nAfrica. Two days ago my delegation hosted a small \r\n \r\n16  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nsummit of the parties to the conflict in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. Several heads of State of \r\nneighbouring countries participated in this summit, \r\nwhich considered the various aspects of the problem, in \r\nan attempt to find an African solution to it. \r\n In addition, last week Lusaka witnessed the \r\nestablishment of the first free trade zone in Africa by \r\nthe summit of the Common Market for Eastern and \r\nSouthern Africa (COMESA). The summit of Sahel and \r\nSaharan countries, which includes my country, \r\ncontinues its efforts to achieve cooperation and \r\ncomplementarity among North, Central and Western \r\nAfrican nations. \r\n Regional economic blocs in every part of the \r\ncontinent continue to progress, with the utmost \r\ndetermination, towards realizing their economic \r\nobjectives. These efforts reaffirm Africa’s resolve to \r\nestablish economic blocs that will play an important \r\nrole in the fields of trade, investment, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and complementarity, in accordance with \r\nthe Abuja Agreement of 1991, which is striving to \r\nmake the vision of the founders of the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity a reality. \r\n Lastly, I would like to reaffirm the importance of \r\nthe United Nations efforts in support of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment programmes. We look forward to the \r\nEconomic and Social Council playing a central role in \r\nthis regard, particularly in this new millennium, and \r\nassisting in sparing Africa the disadvantages of \r\nglobalization and enabling the continent to benefit \r\nfrom the new technology and the information \r\nrevolution that globalization provides. The efforts of \r\nthe United Nations and the international community \r\nwill not succeed, however, without the necessary \r\npolitical will to provide adequate resources for the \r\nsustainable development of Africa. \r\n Africa represents the greatest present challenge to \r\nthe United Nations. As the Secretary-General has so \r\neloquently stated, if the Organization does not succeed \r\nin improving the humanitarian, economic and social \r\nconditions of its people, this will be a political and \r\nmoral failure, not only for the Organization, but also \r\nfor the international community as a whole. \r\n Mr. Sun (Republic of Korea): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\non the implementation of the United Nations New \r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, \r\nwhich has taken stock of progress in its \r\nimplementation, including, in particular, the \r\nmobilization of additional resources. \r\n Despite positive signs of economic growth in \r\nsome parts of Africa, the overall trends in Africa’s \r\neconomic development remain grim. Although \r\nworsening poverty and a widening digital divide, \r\nheavily influenced by globalization, are common in all \r\ndeveloping countries, the situation in Africa is unique \r\nand most dire. For instance, per capita income is \r\nstagnating at around $700 dollars, and the global \r\nmarket share of African countries has remained at less \r\nthan 2 per cent. Official development assistance (ODA) \r\nhas been falling in both nominal and real terms, while \r\nthe debt burden is worsening. To make matters worse, \r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic is running rampant across the \r\ncontinent, and armed conflicts are prevailing in some \r\nparts of the region. \r\n It is, in fact, a daunting challenge to reverse these \r\ntrends. In this regard, I would like to draw delegates’ \r\nattention to the commitments that the world’s leaders \r\nmade at the Millennium Summit for combating poverty \r\nand underdevelopment, in particular in Africa. In line \r\nwith the firm commitments undertaken at the Summit, \r\nwe must make our utmost efforts for the expeditious \r\nand successful implementation of the New Agenda. \r\n In view of the fact that such challenges are \r\ncomplex and multifaceted, we must have a \r\ncomprehensive and integrated approach to take care of \r\nthe various dimensions with socio-economic, political \r\nand institutional ramifications. In this regard, I am \r\nconfident that the United Nations is uniquely \r\npositioned to coordinate activities to meet the \r\ndesperate needs of Africa and that it possesses a \r\ncomparative advantage in dealing with global \r\nproblems. \r\n My delegation would like to highlight two main \r\ntargets of our actions for implementing the New \r\nAgenda. First, there is a pressing need to end armed \r\nconflicts, which prevent Africa from achieving \r\npolitical, economic and social development. Conflicts \r\nbring with them destruction of life and property, and \r\nforce substantial diversions to the defence and military \r\nsectors of scarce resources that could have been used to \r\nrevamp the economies. In order to keep or create peace \r\nin Africa, the United Nations capability for conflict \r\nprevention, peaceful resolution of disputes, \r\npeacekeeping, post-conflict peace-building and \r\nreconstruction must be further strengthened. In this \r\n \r\n 17 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nregard, my delegation welcomes the report of the Panel \r\non United Nations Peace Operations and the report of \r\nthe Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the Causes \r\nof Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and \r\nSustainable Development in Africa. \r\n Secondly, new avenues need to be explored for \r\nmobilizing additional resources and promoting exports \r\nof African countries. So far the funds and programmes, \r\nas well as other agencies of the United Nations, have \r\ntaken a number of initiatives in this area. However, it is \r\ndiscouraging to note the huge gap between the level of \r\nfinancial resources needed for development and the \r\ncapital inflows available to meet these needs. In this \r\nregard, actions to bridge the widening gap need to be \r\ntaken both by donors and recipients. The recipient \r\ncountries must make their best efforts to enhance \r\ncountry ownership and absorptive capacity by \r\npromoting good governance and administrative \r\nreforms, while the donor community provides \r\nincreasing financial resources to deserving countries in \r\na predictable and timely manner. \r\n Over the past several years African countries \r\nhave made a great deal of effort towards export \r\npromotion and diversification, in close collaboration \r\nwith the United Nations system and the donor \r\ncommunity. However, Africa’s share of the global \r\nmarket remains at less than 2 per cent. To facilitate \r\naccess to the international markets of products from \r\nAfrica, redressing the trade barriers alone is not \r\nsufficient; better arrangements need to be in place for \r\nenhancing financial and technical assistance to address \r\nsupply side constraints by improving the quality of \r\ngoods, upgrading infrastructure and promoting \r\nmarketing and packing skills. \r\n The Republic of Korea has made the utmost \r\nefforts for sharing its development experience with \r\nother developing countries, and with African countries \r\nin particular. In cooperation with the Office of the \r\nSpecial Coordinator for Africa and the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, we hosted the Forum on Asia-\r\nAfrica Cooperation in Export Promotion, held in Seoul \r\nin December 1998. As a follow-up to that Forum, my \r\ncountry invited over 40 African experts and offered a \r\ntraining programme for export promotion in July this \r\nyear. \r\n In the area of market access, we removed tariffs \r\non 80 commodities of major export interest to least \r\ndeveloped countries, effective from this year. To \r\npromote South-South cooperation in science and \r\ntechnology, my Government, in collaboration with the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \r\nSpecial Unit for Technical Cooperation among \r\nDeveloping Countries, hosted the Forum on South-\r\nSouth Cooperation in Science and Technology in \r\nFebruary this year. The Republic of Korea has also \r\nincreased the scale of ODA since its admission to the \r\nOrganisation of Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD) in 1996. The volume of ODA in \r\n1999 amounts to over $300 million, and we expect it to \r\nincrease in the years to come. \r\n Finally, 2001 will be an important year for \r\naddressing the issues of development and poverty \r\neradication, as the Third United Nations Conference on \r\nthe Least Developed Countries, the high-level \r\ninternational and intergovernmental event on financing \r\nfor development and the high-level dialogue on \r\nstrengthening international economic cooperation are \r\nto be held. My delegation sincerely hopes that these \r\nevents will make great strides in mobilizing political \r\nwill and financial resources for the sustained \r\ndevelopment of developing countries, especially for the \r\nspecial needs of the African States. \r\n Mr. Bautista (Philippines): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation expresses its thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report prepared for the Assembly’s \r\nconsideration of this agenda item on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for \r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, including \r\nmeasures and recommendations agreed upon at its mid-\r\nterm review. \r\n I would like to focus on just a few matters of \r\nspecial interest to my delegation. My delegation notes \r\nthe positive steps taken by Africa in building its \r\ncapacity to support the process of regional integration, \r\nand notes in particular the efforts of the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa (ECA) in providing technical \r\nassistance to support the development of a regional \r\neconomic community. In particular, we welcome the \r\nECA’s efforts to facilitate the formulation of African \r\npositions at the Seattle World Trade Organization \r\nConference and the tenth session of the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) \r\nin Bangkok. \r\n As a founding member of the Association of \r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Philippines \r\nknows how difficult the process can be, and how much \r\n \r\n18  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\ndedication and hard work are needed for meaningful \r\nprogress towards regional integration. Indeed, we have \r\na special appreciation of the challenges inherent in \r\nintegrating a region composed of countries with \r\ndifferent historical experiences, at varying levels of \r\neconomic development, and with differing levels of \r\nmutual comfort. We therefore believe that ASEAN can \r\ncontribute to Africa’s integration by sharing its \r\nexperiences, particularly with regard to the critical first \r\nsteps. \r\n To this end, the Philippines has participated \r\nactively in the Asia-Africa Forum since it was \r\nestablished. We were particularly encouraged by the \r\nthird Forum, held recently in Kuala Lumpur, in which \r\nwe shared our experiences with regard to the \r\nagricultural sector and the private sector. We also look \r\nforward to a lively exchange of experiences at the \r\nforthcoming Fourth International Conference of New \r\nor Restored Democracies, to be held in Cotonou, \r\nBenin, next month. \r\n My delegation believes that one of the reasons \r\nASEAN has succeeded is because of our efforts to \r\nbuild confidence within the group through the ASEAN \r\napproach of resolving problems among ourselves, \r\nquietly but resolutely. We believe that a similar \r\napproach would help develop a climate conducive to \r\neconomic growth and social development in Africa. In \r\nthis regard, we particularly note the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recognition of the progress made in terms of \r\ndemocratization in the region and the encouraging \r\nperformance of many African economies. Indeed, \r\nnothing helps to establish peace better than democracy \r\nand emerging prosperity. \r\n While a more tranquil environment may be \r\nconducive to growth, my delegation is cognizant of the \r\nfact that, for many countries, the resources are simply \r\nnot available for poverty alleviation projects. This is \r\ndue to many factors, including insufficient capital \r\ninflows, an unmanageable debt burden and the simple \r\nlack of consumer-led consumption. My delegation \r\ntherefore hopes that the enhanced Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative will succeed \r\nwhere its antecedent did not. We particularly hope that \r\nthe Initiative will, among other things, take into \r\naccount capacity to pay. We also voice the concern \r\nexpressed by many that the enhanced HIPC will divert \r\nresources away from official development assistance \r\n(ODA), rather than complement it. \r\n With regards to ODA, my delegation notes with \r\ndisappointment that, while some developed countries \r\nhave met the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nproduct devoted to ODA, most have not. We strongly \r\nencourage these countries to follow the example of the \r\nmore generous developed nations. We do recognize \r\nthat some of the motivations for ODA have shifted as a \r\nresult of the end of the cold war and that many \r\ncountries, including in Africa, are suffering from a \r\ndecline in donor interest and the resulting lack of \r\npredictability in the flow of aid. \r\n A shift in how aid is provided must therefore take \r\nplace. This new approach should make aid more \r\npredictable and should take into account a country’s \r\nstate of underdevelopment. At the same time, recipient \r\ncountries must bear the responsibility of ensuring that \r\nthe necessary infrastructure is in place to ensure that \r\nthe poorest and the most vulnerable truly benefit from \r\nthis aid. My delegation therefore notes with interest the \r\nproposal in the addendum to the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport that aid commitments be institutionalized as \r\nmandatory obligations. While many will have obvious \r\ndifficulties with this idea, it is an interesting point to \r\nponder and a basis for what we hope will be fruitful \r\nfuture discussions.  \r\n My delegation also wishes to support the \r\nobservation that the organizations of the United \r\nNations system working in Africa should take a holistic \r\napproach. Coordination must therefore be enhanced \r\namong the United Nations system’s organizations \r\nworking in Africa. We also share the view that there is \r\na need for harmonizing non-United Nations initiatives \r\nthrough the creation of linkages and the sharing of \r\ninformation. \r\n Finally, I wish to highlight recent Philippine \r\nefforts to enhance our contribution to the development \r\nof Africa. This year, the Philippines initiated the \r\nestablishment of diplomatic relations with African \r\ncountries with which we had no formal relations. In \r\nparticular, we signed the appropriate joint \r\ncommuniqués with the Republic of the Congo, the \r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, the Republic of Togo and, just \r\nthis week, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe. We hope to conclude the remaining joint \r\ncommuniqués in the very near future. \r\n The Philippines has also espoused an active \r\npolicy of pursuing a strong relationship with our \r\nbrothers in the developing world within the umbrella of \r\n \r\n 19 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nSouth-South cooperation, in both the economic and the \r\ntechnical fields. We look forward to concrete results \r\nfrom sharing, in particular, our experiences in capacity- \r\nand institution-building through third-country training \r\nprogrammes, the sending of experts, exchanges of \r\nscholars and fellowships. Indeed, some of these \r\nactivities are ongoing and are being coordinated by the \r\nTechnical Cooperation Council of the Philippines.  \r\n We hope that, through our efforts to intensify our \r\ncooperation with Africa, the Philippines will make a \r\ndifference in the international community’s efforts to \r\nhelp that great continent along the path of development \r\nand prosperity. \r\n Mr. Hussein (Ethiopia): At the outset, I wish to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his progress report on \r\nthe implementation of the United Nations New Agenda \r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-\r\nNADAF). The report provides a solid analysis and \r\nconcrete recommendations for actions at the national \r\nand global levels. \r\n As stated in the report of the Secretary-General, a \r\nnumber of African countries have made substantial \r\nprogress in putting the right macroeconomic policies in \r\nplace. Similarly, considerable progress has been \r\nachieved in implementing the recommendations of the \r\nmid-term review in the promotion of the private sector \r\nand the intensification of the democratization process \r\nand the strengthening of civil society. \r\n Notwithstanding these efforts, Africa’s economic \r\nand social problems remain acute. Africa, despite its \r\nenormous resources, sadly still remains the world’s \r\npoorest region. The continent’s growth rate in 1990 \r\nwas 3 per cent and 2.1 per cent for the entire decade of \r\nthe 1990s. This figure is far below the 7 per cent per \r\nannum growth rate in the gross domestic product \r\nneeded for Africa to meet the international target of \r\nreducing poverty by half by the year 2015.  \r\n Beyond growth and poverty reduction, Africa is \r\nfacing a plethora of underdevelopment traps. The \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic is ravaging Africa. AIDS killed 2 \r\nmillion people in Africa in 1998 alone, leaving millions \r\nof children orphaned. In the 1990s, the international \r\neconomic environment, too, was not conducive to \r\nAfrica’s sustaining growth and making a dent in \r\npoverty. Official development assistance (ODA), which \r\nis the only dependable source of growth and \r\ndevelopment for many in Africa, continued to decline. \r\nODA declined from $19.7 billion in 1992 to $9.7 \r\nbillion in 1998. The unpredictability of such flows has \r\ncontributed to macroeconomic instability and worsened \r\nthe already fragile economy of African countries. \r\n On the debt front, it is not just that the debt relief \r\nbeing provided is coming too late and too slow, but that \r\nthe magnitude of assistance in debt relief is quite \r\nsimply too little. Furthermore, the effectiveness of \r\nexternal transfer, be it in the form of aid or debt relief, \r\nhas been undermined by the nature of the international \r\ndelivery system. Aid management and coordination \r\nbetween donors and multilateral financial institutions \r\nwithout the active involvement of beneficiary countries \r\nhave also undermined aid effectiveness in Africa. \r\n Africa’s share of international trade has also been \r\ndeclining. The share of trade as a source of foreign \r\nexchange and surplus for investment has been \r\ndeteriorating since the early 1980s. The sector has been \r\nbeset by three interrelated problems. These are \r\nincreasing loss of the market share; the perennial \r\nvolatility and fall in terms of trade; and unguarded \r\ntrade liberalization, which has more than doubled the \r\ngrowth of imports to exports. All these factors lead to \r\nthe worsening of the trade balance and the depletion of \r\nresources for investment. According to the report \r\nbefore us, it is estimated that terms-of-trade losses \r\ntypically offset 70 per cent of official development \r\nassistance to Africa, or about 120 per cent of the \r\naverage gross domestic product, for the period 1970-\r\n1997. \r\n As we move forward, it is extremely important to \r\ntake stock of our strengths and weaknesses that are \r\nobserved in the implementation of UN-NADAF and \r\ntake the necessary course of action. We have to \r\nimplement fully — in spirit and in letter — the \r\nrecommendations contained in the mid-term review of \r\nthe New Agenda to resolve the decline of external \r\nresources, the debt overhang problem and the \r\ndeterioration of terms of trade. \r\n It is against this backdrop that we call on our \r\ndevelopment partners to provide substantial, \r\nunconditional and untied aid to Africa commensurate \r\nwith its development needs. The provision of \r\nincreased, predictable and effective development aid is \r\npivotal for growth and sustainable development and \r\npoverty reduction. In addition, substantial reform is \r\nrequired to improve the aid delivery mechanism for \r\ngreater effectiveness. As has been articulated in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the causes of conflict and \r\n \r\n20  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa” (A/52/871), the principles of \r\nownership, participation, partnership and \r\ndecentralization need to be further developed to ensure \r\nthat they are anchored in the recipients’ socio-political \r\nprocess. \r\n For Africa to effectively embark on the path of \r\nsustainable development, it is necessary for the \r\ninternational community to take fast, deep and broad \r\ndebt relief initiatives, including outright debt \r\ncancellation. Full debt relief to the African countries \r\nrepresents a major resource transfer. Most of the recent \r\neconomic analyses on the African debt recommend \r\nunconditional write-offs as the only realistic solution to \r\nthe crisis. \r\n We totally concur with the recommendation of \r\nthe Secretary-General that Africa’s development \r\npartners, besides providing official development \r\nassistance and debt relief, need to provide a package of \r\nincentives to encourage their firms to locate in Africa. \r\nSuch incentives could also entail allowing exporters \r\nfrom Africa unconditional access to the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development markets, \r\nfree of duties. This strategy would have the highest \r\npay-off in terms of transfer of real resources to African \r\nproducers. \r\n While we call on the international community to \r\nlive up to the commitment it entered into 10 years ago, \r\nwe are also fully cognizant that the development of \r\nAfrica remains the responsibility of African countries. \r\nWe need to strengthen the reform that we have started \r\nin order to create an enabling environment for growth \r\nand sustainable development. It is also incumbent on \r\nus to see to it that conflicts within and between States \r\nare quickly resolved, thus strengthening the climate for \r\nmeaningful development. \r\n Finally, it is our earnest hope that the final review \r\nand appraisal of the New Agenda scheduled for 2002 \r\npresents the international community with another \r\nopportunity to examine and reorient its approach to \r\npartnership with Africa and to come up with innovative \r\nstrategies for its sustainable development. We believe \r\nthe cornerstone of this partnership should be ownership \r\nby African countries of their own development plans \r\nand strategies. \r\n Mr. Osio (Nigeria): I am speaking on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China on agenda item 30, \r\n“Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda \r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s”. I would \r\nfirst of all like to congratulate the Secretary-General on \r\na very enlightening progress report. We commend the \r\nreport for study and full implementation. \r\n It is worrisome that the development challenges \r\nthat Africa faced in the 1990s have been carried over to \r\nthe twenty-first century. Increasing that worry is the \r\nfact that these challenges have assumed a more \r\ncomplex and devastating character, calling for urgent \r\nand concrete action on the part of everyone if that \r\nimportant continent is not to slip further into misery. \r\nWhereas African countries grappled in the 1980s and \r\n1990s with the problem of building modern States \r\nfounded on democratic principles and a diversified \r\neconomic base, they are, in addition, now confronted \r\nwith the frightening spectre of total marginalization, \r\neven physical annihilation, in the aftermath of \r\nglobalization and the HIV/AIDS pandemic ravaging \r\nthe continent. The countries are in very dire need of the \r\nbenefits of globalization. \r\n Africa is in danger of being destroyed by \r\nHIV/AIDS. The figures contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report regarding the victims of this scourge \r\nare indeed frightening: 24 million Africans are living \r\nwith HIV/AIDS, representing 70 per cent of the world \r\ntotal; 14 million Africans are already dead from the \r\ndisease; and in 1999 alone 4 million African adults \r\nwere newly infected with the virus. The implications \r\nare obvious. Africa’s adult and working population is \r\nbeing progressively depleted to the point that its socio-\r\neconomic future hangs in the balance. This calls for \r\nurgent and serious action by Africa and its partners. In \r\nthis regard, the HIV/AIDS summit, coming up in \r\nAbuja, Nigeria next year, deserves the support of all. \r\nWith appropriate international support, the Abuja \r\nconference should mark a watershed in the \r\ninternational effort to stem the dangerous tide of \r\nHIV/AIDS in which humanity, especially Africa, is \r\nnow inexorably being carried. \r\n The nature and pace that globalization has \r\nassumed in the past few years is a source of serious \r\nconcern for Africa. Africa’s progressively decreasing \r\nability to attract foreign direct investment and official \r\ndevelopment assistance — despite its huge potential — \r\nand generally mobilize external financial resources is \r\ndirectly attributable to the negative effects of \r\nglobalization on the continent. Dwindling access to the \r\nworld markets and its position on the wrong side of the \r\ndigital divide further aggravate the continent’s dismal \r\n \r\n 21 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nsituation. Indeed, that Africa’s export revenues have \r\ndeclined steadily in the last two decades — from 3.2 \r\nper cent of the world total in 1985 to 1.5 per cent in \r\n1998 — is one serious cause for concern. \r\n If the conventional markets were hard to \r\npenetrate, the emerging e-commerce and e-business \r\nmarket environments of the Internet and the World \r\nWide Web are virtually out of the reach of most \r\nAfrican countries. Africa needs the support and \r\nassistance of the international community to overcome \r\nwhat may be its biggest challenge yet in the \r\ndevelopment process in the early twenty-first century: \r\nentering the information and communication age. In \r\nthis regard, the gesture of Japan at the Okinawa Group \r\nof Eight Summit in setting aside a fund to help \r\ndeveloping countries to meet the challenges of \r\ninformation technology is commendable. When \r\noperationalized, that gesture is worthy of emulation.  \r\n The debt overhang probably constitutes the \r\ngreatest impediment to development for many African \r\ncountries. Many African countries have been weighed \r\ndown for decades by a heavy debt burden. These \r\ncountries continue to be hampered by the excruciating \r\nweight of debt and debt servicing obligations, which \r\nconsume more than 33 per cent of annual revenues. \r\nAny initiative that seeks to promote the rapid \r\ndevelopment of the continent must therefore include a \r\nstrategy for technology transfer and for alleviating the \r\ndebt burden. Not only should the enhanced Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative be at \r\nonce expanded to include many more countries, but the \r\ninitiative should also be adequately funded and \r\nredesigned to achieve the desired objective of freeing \r\nthe resources of these countries, especially in Africa, \r\nfor development. In fact, debt cancellation for the \r\nworld’s poorest and indebted countries remains the \r\nmost viable option. \r\n We recognize that the New Agenda for the \r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s represents a \r\nveritable and viable blueprint for achieving the rapid \r\nsocio-economic development of the continent, even in \r\nthe new century. The strategies for effective \r\nmobilization of external and domestic resources, the \r\npromotion and invigoration of the private sector and \r\nthe intensification of the democratic process are all on \r\ntarget in this regard. In addition, a quick and effective \r\nresolution of the debt problem and increased market \r\naccess and better pricing for African commodities \r\nwould go a long way in contributing to Africa’s efforts \r\nfor and dream of economic revival and renaissance in \r\nthe twenty-first century. \r\n Furthermore, African countries would make their \r\nown efforts at industrialization and diversification of \r\ntheir economic base, thereby intensifying agricultural \r\nproduction, while following the path of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, preferably in concert with regional \r\npartners. But these would be feasible only if Africa \r\npaid due attention to the development of its human \r\nresource base by providing appropriate education, \r\nhealth care and infrastructure, as well as ensuring the \r\nfull participation of all segments of society in the task \r\nof nation-building. These are very evident in the \r\nrecommendations contained in the mid-term review of \r\nthe New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the \r\n1990s. But adequate funds are needed to implement \r\nand attain these noble objectives. \r\n It is sad that no single country, let alone a whole \r\ncontinent like Africa, can survive on a diet of good \r\nrecommendations or promises alone. Action, only \r\nproductive and gainful action, on the recommendations \r\nnow placed before us can bring about the desired \r\nsocio-economic growth and development of Africa and \r\nits people. The Group of 77 and China are therefore \r\nhappy to note that Africa, with its huge potential for \r\ndevelopment and prosperity, is not without friends. \r\n Let me conclude by stating again our appreciation \r\nfor the good work being undertaken under the United \r\nNations initiative. We can assure the Assembly that the \r\nGroup of 77 and China are prepared to work \r\nassiduously, nationally and in collaboration with the \r\nUnited Nations system and all our partners, for the \r\nactualization of the laudable objectives of the New \r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa. We count on \r\nthe support and cooperation of all, in the new and \r\ninvigorated spirit of globalization and the common \r\ndestiny of humankind. \r\n Mr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): Africa has \r\ndemonstrated its commitment and determination to \r\nbring opportunity and progress to its peoples. Since the \r\nmid-1980s many countries on the continent have made \r\nimportant strides, reforming their economies, \r\nimproving macroeconomic management, liberalizing \r\nmarkets and trade and making the private sector the \r\nengine of growth. \r\n Despite the outbreak of conflicts and natural \r\ndisasters in parts of the continent, Africa made gains in \r\nthe 1990s, with rising incomes and exports and, in \r\n \r\n22  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nsome cases, with decreases in severe poverty. Political \r\nreforms have led to participatory governance and \r\nexpanded the horizons of civil liberties. \r\n The progress achieved so far has, however, not \r\nbeen enough to overcome the enormous development \r\nchallenges facing the continent. While 5 per cent \r\nannual growth is needed just to keep the number of the \r\npoor from rising, African economies grew by only 3 \r\nper cent in 1999, a marginal increase over 1998. Gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) growth in 2000 is only \r\nexpected to increase to 4.2 per cent. The annual growth \r\nof 7 per cent estimated to lead to halving poverty by \r\n2015 appears remote, with only three countries \r\nattaining that rate in 1999. Average income per capita \r\nis lower than at the end of the 1960s. \r\n The Secretary-General’s progress report on this \r\nagenda item points to other problems: declining export \r\nshares in traditional primary products and terms of \r\ntrade losses which offset concessional loans and grants. \r\nAfrica’s share in global foreign direct investment \r\ninflows remained at the low level of 1.2 per cent in \r\n1999, compared with 2.3 per cent in 1997 and 1.2 per \r\ncent in 1998. It is clear that, eight years since the \r\nadoption of the United Nations New Agenda for the \r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), the \r\nchallenge of Africa’s development requires even bolder \r\ncommitment and action. \r\n Only last week my delegation noted in the debate \r\non the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Causes of Conflict and the Promotion of \r\nDurable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa \r\nthe failure of the international community to \r\nimplement policies on market access, debt relief, \r\ninternational financial flows and official development \r\nassistance (ODA) needed to leverage Africa’s own \r\nefforts to achieve sustained growth and development. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the mobilization of \r\nadditional resources for African development \r\nreinforces this point. \r\n We therefore welcome this opportunity to assess \r\nthe impact of the New Agenda, a compact between \r\nAfrica and the international community. We believe \r\nthat such an assessment would set the stage for the \r\nevaluation of the New Agenda in 2002 and help map \r\nout the way forward. We anxiously look forward to the \r\nevaluation. \r\n There are several initiatives on Africa, along with \r\nother events also focusing on Africa, planned for the \r\ncoming year. While this proliferation may give the \r\nmistaken impression of progress, we believe that the \r\nbenefits from all the initiatives on Africa will come \r\nfrom our ability to consider them within a holistic \r\nframework. In this regard, consideration of the \r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF must take into account \r\nall the other relevant processes, such as the Third \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries, the special session of the General Assembly \r\non HIV/AIDS and the High-level International \r\nIntergovernmental Event on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. \r\n As important as the review process is, Africa \r\ncannot wait until 2002 for the outstanding issues \r\ncritical to its development to be addressed. The \r\nSecretary-General’s report, as well as reports by other \r\nmajor international institutions, provide adequate input \r\nfor effective and immediate action. In this regard, we \r\nappreciate the efforts of both bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners in the context of Africa’s development. We \r\nregret, however, that the contributions of some of our \r\npartners have yet to match their potential or expressed \r\ncommitment. \r\n In this connection, we reiterate the proposals that \r\nhave been made by our delegation, among others, for a \r\nreal commitment to write off Africa’s debt and reach \r\nagreement on market access for products of critical \r\ninterest to African countries in a coherent manner to \r\nensure conditions for Africa’s growth and \r\ndevelopment. This means putting priority on resolving, \r\nwithin the shortest possible time, trade issues over \r\nagriculture, textiles and leather outside the framework \r\nof the comprehensive round of trade negotiations being \r\ncanvassed. \r\n We also urge the major industrial countries to \r\nconsider providing additional capital to the World \r\nBank, as well as their national institutions, to expand \r\nthe possibilities for export credit and investment \r\nguarantee schemes in leveraging private capital to \r\nAfrica, especially to sectors with greater forward and \r\nbackward linkages. \r\n Official development assistance (ODA) remains a \r\nmajor catalyst for the attraction of private capital \r\nflows. It is also an essential source of funding for the \r\ncapacity-building needed in Africa to enable the \r\ncontinent to take advantage of the opportunities created \r\nby globalization. Therefore, the decline of ODA to \r\nAfrica is a matter of great concern. We must reconsider \r\n \r\n 23 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\nthe basis of the changing motivation for development \r\nassistance, as well as the need for a coordinated \r\napproach to ODA that maximizes its impact. Linking \r\nODA to conditionality poses grave problems for our \r\nefforts to eradicate poverty, particularly our \r\ncommitment to the most vulnerable segments of our \r\nsocieties. \r\n It is important to underscore the need to focus \r\nattention on the pervasive capital flight from Africa. \r\nAfrica must, in cooperation with the relevant \r\ninternational bodies, design policy frameworks to \r\nensure stability that encourages the retention of foreign \r\ncurrency on the continent. It is clear, however, that \r\nother forms of net transfer of resources abroad are also \r\nharmful to Africa’s economy. In this respect, measures \r\nshould be taken to reverse the net resource transfer \r\nabroad that sometimes results from the implementation \r\nof aid programmes. \r\n The diverse initiatives which have been \r\nundertaken at the bilateral and multilateral levels must \r\nfeed into the larger framework of the New Agenda. Our \r\ngoal must be to seek interlinkages, coherence and \r\ncomprehensiveness to ensure that the solutions meet \r\nthe challenges and that they create the critical mass \r\nenvisaged in the Secretary-General’s report. \r\n We recognize the work being done by the United \r\nNations system to assist the efforts of African countries \r\nin education, health, governance, information \r\ntechnology, population and South-South cooperation, \r\namong others. Their sustained efforts to deepen the \r\nfocus on Africa is commendable, and we encourage \r\nthem to continue building on their partnerships, \r\nincluding with the World Bank and others, to increase \r\nthe impact of their activities. We urge all countries in a \r\nposition to do so to increase their contributions to the \r\nfunds and programmes to enable them to achieve their \r\nobjectives in programme countries. \r\n Ultimately, no one can change the fate of Africa \r\nexcept Africans themselves. We still need to pursue \r\nwith urgency the outstanding work in the process of \r\neconomic and political reforms. Our commitment to \r\nzero tolerance for unconstitutional changes in \r\ngovernment and for civil conflict must be demonstrated \r\nthrough proactive support for and encouragement of \r\ngood governance. \r\n Every day that each of us, as partners and owners \r\nof Africa’s development, fails to take the bold but right \r\ndecisions for Africa’s development, we add to the \r\nmagnitude of the continent’s development challenge. \r\nWe must resolve to use the process of the UN-NADAF \r\nreview to change the dynamic of Africa’s development \r\nagenda in order to launch Africa on a truly sustainable \r\ncourse of progress. \r\n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At its forty-sixth session, the General \r\nAssembly decided to make Africa one of its priorities \r\nfor the 1990s, or even its top priority. In this context, it \r\nunanimously adopted the United Nations New Agenda \r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-\r\nNADAF). This New Agenda, which represented a real \r\ncontract of solidarity between the international \r\ncommunity and Africa, defined the commitments and \r\nthe responsibilities of both parties. \r\n In two years we will celebrate the tenth \r\nanniversary of the New Agenda. Is not this a good time \r\nto ask ourselves what has become of these \r\ncommitments? Has the Agenda become just one more \r\nof the many unimplemented declarations? These \r\nquestions need to be asked because of the dwindling \r\ninterest in the debate on Africa, specifically the debate \r\non the New Agenda for its development in the 1990s. \r\n My delegation was very interested in the \r\nSecretary-General’s mid-term report on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for \r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. \r\n Naturally, my country welcomes the efforts made \r\nby the international community to provide the African \r\ncontinent with additional financial resources to enable \r\nit to improve the standard of living of its people and to \r\ncombat poverty. \r\n Cameroon recognizes the important role played \r\nby Governments, the United Nations agencies and \r\norgans and the other partners in promoting a number of \r\nprojects involving the private sector, intensifying the \r\ndemocratization process and strengthening civil \r\nsociety. \r\n For their part, the vast majority of African \r\ncountries have taken steps to ensure far-reaching \r\neconomic reforms within sectoral and structural \r\nframeworks agreed during the mid-term review. Many \r\ncountries have had encouraging results, sometimes, if \r\nnot always, at the cost of enormous sacrifices. \r\n However, today we note, as emphasized in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General, that the objectives set \r\nin the New Agenda in terms of mobilizing external \r\n \r\n24  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nresources have not been achieved. In fact, official \r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa has declined, from \r\n$19.7 billion in 1992 to $9.7 billion in 1998. As for \r\nforeign direct investment, it is being diverted from \r\nAfrica despite the incentives put in place by African \r\ncountries and despite the continent’s great potential. \r\nMeanwhile, Africa’s external debt burden, estimated at \r\n$350 billion, has continued to grow in spite of debt-\r\nrelief measures intended to lighten it adopted in the \r\ncontext of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) \r\nDebt Initiative. \r\n It is clear from these observations that the New \r\nAgenda has not met our expectations. Let us recall that \r\nthe United Nations New Agenda was intended to be a \r\ncatalyst, a political engine that would drive all African \r\ndevelopment activities within and outside the \r\ncontinent. In that regard, initiatives to promote the \r\ndevelopment of Africa should encourage the \r\nimplementation of the Agenda and should avoid the \r\noverlapping that has a negative impact on the \r\nimplementation of agreed measures. In the view of my \r\ndelegation, implementation has been impaired by \r\ninsufficient political will, insufficient coordination and \r\ninsufficient coherence. This has resulted in a diffusion \r\nof energies, a decline in the level of activities, \r\ninadequate mobilization of resources, and the \r\ninefficient use of existing resources. Corrective \r\nmeasures must therefore be taken if we wish to lend \r\nfresh momentum to the implementation of UN-\r\nNADAF, an Agenda that had given rise to such high \r\nhopes. \r\n Here, we think the recommendations made by the \r\nCommittee on Programme and Coordination at its \r\nthirty-eighth through fortieth sessions are of particular \r\ninterest; they could be extremely useful. It is \r\nsignificant that, in preparing his report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral drew on those recommendations of the \r\nCommittee on Programme and Coordination. \r\n Let me recall some of what we see as the key \r\nrecommendations. With a view to avoiding wasteful \r\noverlapping among the various United Nations \r\nprogrammes for Africa, the Committee on Programme \r\nand Coordination identified the United Nations \r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa as an \r\nimplementing arm of the New Agenda. The Committee \r\nalso strongly advocated the implementation of a \r\nstrategic master plan setting out the directions to be \r\ntaken by various partners, identifying goals, defining \r\nevaluation mechanisms and providing for the sharing \r\nof responsibilities among the various actors. \r\n The Secretariat was to play the role of advocate-\r\ngeneral for Africa by continuing to mobilize \r\ninternational public opinion in favour of the cause of \r\nAfrican development. The Office of the Special \r\nCoordinator for Africa and the Least Developed \r\nCountries was to monitor closely the implementation \r\nof UN-NADAF and, when necessary, to sound the \r\nalarm. Finally, the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and the Economic Commission for Africa \r\nwere to design specific operational activities. \r\n Have that concept and that division labour, \r\napproved by the General Assembly, been respected? \r\nThere is every reason to doubt it. Certainly, the \r\nhaziness resulting from such non-respect seems to have \r\na great deal to do with the deplorable lack of progress \r\nto date towards implementation of the Agenda. \r\n Finally, the Committee on Programme and \r\nCoordination advocated an independent evaluation of \r\nthe programme that, at the time of the final review and \r\nappraisal scheduled for 2002, would make it possible \r\nobjectively to measure the quantity and quality of \r\nresources and programmes, along with their real impact \r\non the sustainable development of Africa. We are \r\npleased that the Economic and Social Council acted on \r\nthat recommendation: at its 1999 substantive session, \r\nthe Council declared that following the 2002 final \r\nreview it would task independent experts with \r\nevaluating the implementation of the Agenda. Here, we \r\nagree with the Committee on Programme and \r\nCoordination that for such an evaluation to be \r\nobjective, its terms of reference must be defined in \r\nadvance. \r\n My delegation makes these observations in the \r\nlight of the momentum generated for the New Agenda \r\nat the Millennium Summit, during which the \r\ninternational community decided that Africa remained \r\nits top priority. The Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n55/2), which confirmed that priority, reiterated the \r\ndetermination of heads of State or Government and of \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to stand firmly by \r\nAfrica in its struggle to attain lasting peace and \r\nsustainable development. Africa, which is facing so \r\nmany old and new problems — with the new ones \r\namounting to a pandemic — expects a great deal from \r\nthe concrete manifestations of this renewed solidarity. \r\n \r\n 25 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\n As I approach the end of my remarks, I would \r\nrecall the appeal for Africa that Pope John Paul II made \r\nat Yaoundé: \r\n  “Africa is a continent in which countless \r\nhuman beings — men, women, children and \r\nyoung people — have in a sense been left by the \r\nwayside, ill, wounded, powerless, marginalized \r\nand abandoned. They have a crying need for good \r\nSamaritans who will come to their assistance”. \r\n These concerns, as expressed in the words of the \r\nHoly Father, are the same as those expressed in the \r\nMillennium Declaration, particularly in the paragraph \r\nrelating to solidarity. May the commitments made by \r\nheads of State or Government at the Millennium \r\nSummit give rise to a real response to this appeal from \r\nAfrica — the continent of the future. We have said this \r\nbefore, and we repeat it today: Africa will remember. \r\n Mr. Hønningstad (Norway): I would like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for the considerable effort \r\nthat has gone into the report before us. The activities \r\nand initiatives presented in the report show an \r\nadmirable scope and diversity. It gives an interesting, \r\nalthough not altogether encouraging, picture of the \r\nsituation in Africa. In spite of the continent’s natural \r\nresources, Africa scores lower on key development \r\ncriteria — notably, economic growth — than other \r\nregions of the world. Of course, the reasons for the \r\nslow development do not lie only with Africa. The debt \r\nburden is excessive, official development assistance \r\nflows are too low, trade obstacles to Africa’s exports \r\nare considerable and the digital divide is getting wider. \r\nWhile the world is richer than ever before, the North-\r\nSouth gap continues to widen. \r\n In this context I would like to touch upon one of \r\nthe most urgent challenges facing the African States. \r\nPoverty reduction is crucial in terms of economic \r\ndevelopment, political stability and regional and global \r\nsecurity, and economic development is fundamental to \r\nachieving poverty reduction. We therefore believe that \r\nthe international trend of reduced disbursements of \r\ndevelopment assistance must be reversed. My \r\nGovernment is currently working on a plan to increase \r\nNorway’s development assistance to 1 per cent of gross \r\ndomestic product. Special emphasis will be placed on \r\nincreased cooperation with our African partners. \r\n However, neither bilateral assistance nor \r\nmultilateral arrangements can assume the responsibility \r\nthat rests at the national level, nor would that be \r\ndesirable. The main responsibility for development \r\nstrategies leading to sustained progress rests, therefore, \r\nwith Africa. It is African countries themselves that \r\nmust show leadership to generate economic growth. \r\n Development strategies will best succeed when \r\nimplemented in a stable political environment and \r\naimed at both economic and social progress, including \r\nhealth, education and gender equality issues. \r\nAccountable democratic Governments and the rule of \r\nlaw are vital elements in any development process. \r\n Since the beginning of the 1990s we have seen \r\nmany African States opt for economic and political \r\nreform. Unfortunately, we have also seen the outbreak \r\nof new wars  and, in several countries, continuing civil \r\nstrife, dashing our hopes for a more peaceful future for \r\nAfrica. This turn of events may threaten the stability \r\nand future prospects of large parts of the continent. \r\n The report rightly emphasizes the responsibility \r\nof African countries for positive developments in \r\nAfrica. Increasing African capacity with regard to \r\npeacekeeping operations and conflict prevention will \r\ncontribute to the stability of the continent. The role of \r\nthe international community should primarily be to \r\nstrengthen and support efforts and initiatives taken by \r\nthe African countries themselves. This is part of our \r\nglobal responsibility, and we look forward to such \r\ncooperation with our African partners. \r\n In many African countries, particularly in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, the AIDS pandemic is ravaging whole \r\ncommunities. We agree with the observation in the \r\nreport that without a renewed effort in many countries \r\nthe AIDS pandemic may erode all the progress that has \r\nbeen made since political independence. The \r\nInternational Partnership against AIDS in Africa should \r\nbe highlighted here, as a new and innovative initiative \r\nto turn this tragic situation around. We also recall the \r\nimportant debate in the Security Council in January on \r\nthe impact of HIV/AIDS on peace and security in \r\nAfrica, and the follow-up meeting in the Economic and \r\nSocial Council in February. \r\n I should like to point out that Norway’s \r\nprogrammes for development cooperation with our \r\nAfrican partners have increasingly addressed questions \r\nof governance, democracy-building and human \r\nrights — factors which are crucial in order to prevent \r\nconflicts from erupting. We fully endorse the report’s \r\nrecommendation that African countries should pay \r\nattention to ensuring accountability, transparency and \r\n \r\n26  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nthe rule of law in their efforts to improve governance \r\nand increase the involvement of civil society. My \r\nGovernment will continue to support programmes and \r\ninstitutions that pay heed to these guiding principles, \r\nwhich constitute the basis of sustainable development. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to recall part VII of \r\nthe Millennium Declaration, entitled “Meeting the \r\nspecial needs of Africa”, which in our view constitutes \r\nmore than a blueprint for sustainable development on \r\nthe African continent. It is an obligation for the world \r\ncommunity, in particular the donor countries, to \r\nsupport Africa in its struggle to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment in all sectors and to bring Africa into the \r\nmainstream of the world economy. \r\n Mr. Mostafa Chowdhury (Bangladesh): The \r\ninternational community has been making efforts to \r\nbring the special needs of Africa to the forefront of the \r\nglobal development agenda for some time. At long last \r\nwe are openly discussing, in different global forums, \r\nissues of African development. Many measures are \r\nbeing suggested; many commitments — although they \r\nare far from adequate — have also been made. But, \r\nsadly, our actions are not keeping pace with our \r\nwords — indeed, they are lagging far behind. \r\n The development problems of Africa, the home of \r\n33 out of the 48 least developed countries, have now \r\nbeen widely recognized. The Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, in the addendum, describes the resource issues \r\nin some detail. I will refer briefly to some of the facts. \r\n The overall flow of official development \r\nassistance (ODA) has continued to diminish globally; \r\nAfrica has not been spared. There has been a 24 per \r\ncent yearly reduction since 1990; ODA declined from \r\n$19.7 billion in 1992 to $9.7 billion in 1998. This is \r\nhurting the African countries most of all, as they have \r\nlittle opportunity to mobilize sufficient domestic \r\nresources to undertake vital projects like the building \r\nof infrastructure and telecommunication networks. \r\nThese are among the essential preconditions for \r\nattracting foreign investment. Aggregate resource \r\nflows to Africa declined from $26 billion in 1997 to \r\n$17.1 billion in 1998, a staggering reduction in a one-\r\nyear period. \r\n Africa’s debt burden is increasing, despite the \r\nvarious well publicized measures taken to reduce the \r\ndebt overhang. Debt service as a percentage of exports \r\nwas 30 per cent in 1999, compared with 21.3 per cent \r\nin 1997. Indeed, it is difficult to discern what \r\nsignificant improvements the current initiatives have \r\nmade. \r\n Africa’s loss of global market share for the period \r\n1970-1997 amounted to $68 billion. That stands in \r\nstark contrast to the sharp increase in the volume of \r\nglobal trade. There has been an increasing loss in \r\nmarket share for Africa’s traditional exports. \r\n The world has agreed to reduce absolute poverty \r\nby half by the year 2015. To achieve this target, a \r\nminimum growth rate of 7 per cent, continued for the \r\nnext 15 years, has to be ensured. In fact, average \r\ngrowth in the last decade was a mere 2.1 per cent. \r\n Per capita income in 1998 slipped to $668, \r\ncompared to $749 in 1980. This has give rise to an \r\nincrease in the number of people living in poverty, \r\nrather than a reduction. \r\n These are but a few examples of the deterioration \r\nof the development scenario in Africa and the \r\ndiminishing inflow of resources in a region where the \r\nneed for increased international support is widely \r\nrecognized. In the last decade, the world has seen a \r\ntremendous increase in international trade and in the \r\naccumulation of global wealth. Although this has been \r\nmostly concentrated in the industrialized world, some \r\ndeveloping countries have registered notable success; \r\nmany others also shared a spin-off benefit. But Africa \r\nhas been left out. \r\n African countries, like other developing nations, \r\nhave been fighting to overcome underdevelopment. \r\nHowever, their task has been especially difficult, as a \r\nnumber of complicating factors, on a magnified scale, \r\nare holding back the progress they otherwise could \r\nachieve. \r\n Poverty is pervasive in Africa, with a high \r\nconcentration of people living in conditions of absolute \r\npoverty in many of the sub-Saharan countries, which \r\nmakes it extremely difficult to mobilize domestic \r\nresources. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is especially acute \r\nin Africa, robbing it of the vitality of the younger \r\ngeneration. Millions of adults are dying or becoming \r\ndebilitated. Millions of children are being orphaned \r\nand face an uncertain future with little hope. The \r\nhealth-care system is overwhelmed and cannot deal \r\nwith the many public health threats, such as  the \r\nscourge of malaria and tuberculosis. \r\n The major global conferences of the 1990s set out \r\nguidelines on how to fight underdevelopment and \r\n \r\n 27 \r\n \r\n A/55/PV.57\r\npoverty. Most countries have chalked out their own \r\nnational programmes of action to put the agreed \r\nprinciples to work. It is ironic, however, that at a time \r\nwhen national machinery is poised to deliver a much \r\ngreater output for any unit of investment, international \r\nsupport and assistance are drying up. It is also \r\nunfortunate that we are not coming up with bold \r\ninitiatives to join forces with Africa in the fight against \r\nthe root causes of underdevelopment. \r\n African countries are bravely fighting against \r\nmany odds. There are many factors, however, which \r\nare beyond their individual efforts. The international \r\ncommunity should be much more forthcoming, in a \r\nspirit of genuine partnership and support, in Africa’s \r\nstruggle to break out of the vicious circle of \r\nunderdevelopment and poverty. There is an urgent and \r\ndesperate need to combine our individual efforts to \r\nlend support to Africa, and we have a  moral obligation \r\nto do so. \r\n Mr. Aboulgheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAfrican countries made tremendous efforts to reform \r\nand improve their domestic, economic, political and \r\nsocial environments during the 1990s, and in so doing \r\nencountered major obstacles and difficulties. Those \r\nefforts, as is noted in the report (A/55/350) of the \r\nSecretary-General, have led to progress in the fields \r\naddressed by the mid-term review in 1995, namely \r\nconsolidating the process of economic adjustments and \r\nreform, encouraging the private sector and enhancing \r\ndemocracy and civil society. \r\n The reform and development of any society is \r\nprimarily the responsibility of that society. However, \r\nseveral major obstacles are impeding the efforts of \r\nmost African countries to overcome the challenges of \r\npoverty and disease and to open up prospects for \r\ndevelopment. Foremost among those obstacles are \r\nrapid developments in the international economic \r\nenvironment and the failure by the international \r\ncommunity, despite several initiatives to that end, to \r\ncreate a suitable mechanism to integrate the African \r\ncountries, in particular the least developed ones, into \r\nthe international economy. \r\n International economic crises, turmoil and \r\nupheavals that occurred towards the end of the 1990s \r\nunderscored the urgent need for internal reform among \r\nthe developing nations in order to adapt to the new \r\ninternational realities. At the same time, they reflected \r\nthe presence of certain shortcomings in the framework \r\nof international trade and financial institutions, which \r\nshould be decisively redressed. \r\n In this context, I wish to state frankly that most of \r\nthe solutions offered to the developing nations tend to \r\nemphasize the internal, domestic dimension while \r\nlargely ignoring the negative impact of imbalances in \r\nthe system of international trade and finance. The \r\nspeedy pace of globalization, which has given rise to \r\nrapid movement in capital markets and to strong \r\ncompetition, has led to practices that tend to restrict \r\ntrade. These practices, which include anti-dumping \r\npolicies and the application of rigid, inflexible sanitary \r\nand environmental measures and standards, are being \r\nmisused in order to restrict the exports of the \r\ndeveloping nations to the developed countries. This has \r\nled to major economic losses for the developing \r\nnations in general and the African countries in \r\nparticular. \r\n In addition, there has been a continued decline in \r\nofficial development assistance, to the extent that the \r\ninternationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational product has become almost impossible to \r\nachieve, in view of the poor performance of most \r\ndonor countries in this respect. There is no sign that \r\nthis objective will be attained any time soon, even \r\nthough official development assistance remains the \r\nmain source of financing for development in most \r\nAfrican countries. \r\n Furthermore, Africa’s share of foreign direct \r\ninvestment does not exceed 6 per cent of total \r\ninvestments geared to the developing countries, and the \r\nAIDS pandemic is ravaging the continent, killing \r\nmillions annually and threatening economic and social \r\nstability in several countries of the continent. This is \r\nby any standard a truly tragic situation. \r\n Efforts at social, political and economic reform \r\nby the African countries remain a sine qua non for the \r\nrealization of their aspirations to development and \r\nprogress. However, those efforts should be \r\naccompanied by a serious international undertaking to \r\nenable the African countries to continue their march \r\ntowards development, through the opening of markets \r\nto the products of those countries and by increasing \r\nofficial development assistance, as we have already \r\nmentioned. \r\n In this context, I wish to underline the need for \r\nthe forthcoming Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries, to be held in Brussels next May, and the \r\n \r\n28  \r\n \r\nA/55/PV.57  \r\nHigh-level International Intergovernmental Event on \r\nFinancing for Development to deal seriously and \r\nrealistically with the needs of the African countries and \r\nto redress the imbalances in the present international \r\ntrade and financial systems, with a view to creating an \r\nexternal environment conducive to helping those \r\ncountries achieve sustainable development. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item. \r\n I would like to inform members that a draft \r\nresolution on this item will be submitted at a later date. \r\n \r\n  Programme of work \r\n \r\n The President: I should like to inform members \r\nthat document A/INF/55/3/Add.3 contains a revised \r\nprogramme of work and schedule of plenary meetings \r\nof the General Assembly for the remainder of \r\nNovember 2000. It had been circulated to delegations \r\nthis morning and is also available at the documents \r\ndistribution centre in the General Assembly Hall. \r\n Before adjourning the meeting, I would like to \r\ninform members that the remaining two items on the \r\nagenda for this morning — namely agenda item 44, \r\n“Global implications of the year 2000 date conversion \r\nproblem of computers”, and agenda item 180, \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nEconomic Community of Central African States,” will \r\nbe taken up this afternoon at 3 p.m. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
