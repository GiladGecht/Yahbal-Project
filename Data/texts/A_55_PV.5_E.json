This\r\nphenomenon, which is the product of economic, social,\r\ncultural and technological developments and\r\nbreakthroughs in the field of information, has become\r\nnot only a major factor in the process of political\r\ndecision-making, but a standard for determining the\r\nelements of international relations.\r\nWe find ourselves talking about a world of\r\ndiminished distances and dimensions, of easy means of\r\ncommunications among peoples and nations, by virtue\r\nof the emerging means that the informatics revolution\r\nhas provided; a world in which we witness with great\r\nadmiration the giant strides taken and the impressive\r\nresults achieved through scientific research,\r\nparticularly during the last decade of the previous\r\ncentury.\r\nIt is regrettable, however, that in this same world,\r\ntechnological and even linguistic illiteracy are\r\nwidespread among the majority of its peoples.\r\nApproximately 1 billion of its inhabitants suffer in\r\nabject and disgraceful poverty. As a result of the\r\neconomic invasion, the economies of many countries\r\nare threatened with permanent crises and stifling debts.\r\nMoreover, its natural environment is deteriorating due\r\nto abusive exploitation, which runs counter to the\r\nrecommendations of numerous international forums,\r\nparticularly the Conference held at Rio de Janeiro.\r\nIs this not the way things really are? Is this state\r\nof affairs not far removed from the ideal of building on\r\nEarth and honouring human beings advocated by all\r\nreligions and enshrined by international norms and\r\ncovenants? As we take part in this international forum,\r\nwhich embodies the universality of man, are we not\r\nsupposed to stand together, to think and consider the\r\nideal formula for restoring normalcy and making up for\r\nwhat is lost before it is too late? We, as individuals and\r\ngroups, have a great responsibility to bear with\r\nintegrity in the service of present and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nTo achieve a better future for humanity and to\r\nrealize the principles of the United Nations is\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nimpossible without collective political will, wherein all\r\nparties in the international community cooperate with\r\neach other in one concerted effort with the aim of\r\nadopting a strategy aimed essentially at narrowing the\r\neconomic and scientific gap among States and at\r\nensuring to the optimum the fair utilization of the fruits\r\nof technological progress. We believe that the United\r\nNations is qualified to formulate an international\r\nsystem that includes globalization and spreads its\r\nblessings on all humanity, while curbing its negative\r\neffects.\r\nHere, we should like to lay out our viewpoint\r\nconcerning the procedural steps that may ensure the\r\nsuccess of such a strategy. First, we firmly believe that\r\nthe objective condition for bringing nations closer\r\ntogether lies in establishing a comprehensive\r\neducational plan based on eliminating linguistic\r\nilliteracy, promulgating compulsory education and\r\nproviding opportunities for harnessing information\r\ntechnology in the service of the goals of development.\r\nThe human being of the third millennium cannot be\r\nsatisfied merely by knowing how to write, but should\r\nbe able to master the use of the modern means of\r\ncommunication and to freely express his ideas and to\r\ndiscuss those of other people.\r\nSecondly, in order to improve the economic\r\nsituation of developing countries, particularly the\r\npoorest among them, serious consideration should be\r\ngiven to cancelling the debts of poor States. We believe\r\nthat it may be useful for these debts to be converted\r\ninto capital invested in development projects that\r\nwould revive the production process and generate\r\nemployment opportunities, which would, in turn,\r\nreduce, if not eliminate, the flow of emigration to\r\ndeveloped countries. It would be appropriate, in this\r\nrespect, to provide special support to those States that\r\nhave taken fundamental steps towards democracy.\r\nThirdly, it is somewhat regrettable that\r\ndevelopment assistance given by donor countries is not\r\nproportionate with their gross domestic product. This\r\nruns counter to good judgement and logic.\r\nFourthly and lastly, we believe that it is in the\r\ninterest of developed countries to be mindful of the\r\ngreat damage that will befall them by reason of their\r\neconomic policies vis-à-vis the developing countries.\r\nWe shall briefly refer, in this respect, to three\r\nindicators.\r\nThe first indicator relates to the developing\r\ncountries that produce and export raw materials.\r\nIndustrialized developed countries are indifferent to the\r\nhigh prices of their own products, while they raise\r\nobjecting voices when the prices of raw materials, such\r\nas petroleum, rise in international markets, although\r\nsuch an increase is the result of high taxes imposed by\r\nthose developed countries. The second indicator relates\r\nto the industrial countries resorting to various excuses\r\nwith the aim of weakening the competitive power of\r\nsome developing countries. The third indicator relates\r\nto the increasing restrictions that those developed\r\ncountries and their giant corporations impose on the\r\nexploitation of the great advances that have been made\r\nin the various spheres of human knowledge and\r\ntechnology development, under the pretext of\r\nprotecting intellectual property.\r\nWe endorse the constructive proposals submitted\r\nby the Secretary-General in his report concerning the\r\nelimination of armed conflicts in the world and the role\r\nof the United Nations in this respect. We would\r\nemphasize the particular importance of three issues.\r\nFirst, the United Nations should be urged to\r\nenhance its role in bringing the Arab-Israeli conflict to\r\nan end. We welcome any other efforts that could be\r\nmade outside the United Nations in this regard,\r\nprovided that they pay due respect to the rights of the\r\nPalestinian and Syrian peoples established by\r\ninternational resolutions. In the same context, we\r\nbelieve that the issue of Holy Jerusalem should be\r\naccorded the extreme priority that it deserves, by\r\nreason of its distinct place in the hearts and minds of\r\nArabs and Muslims, and since it is the cornerstone of\r\nany prospective peace in the Middle East.\r\nThe second issue is the necessity of moving\r\nquickly towards making the Middle East a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone. From this forum, we call on Israel to\r\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons.\r\nThe third issue relates to the necessity of putting\r\nchecks on the way international sanctions are imposed.\r\nThese checks should establish a time-frame so that\r\nthese sanctions will not continue forever.\r\nAs we look forward to contributing to the\r\nimprovement of the performance of the United Nations,\r\nwe feel that the only way to realize this goal is to\r\nextend democratic practices and equal opportunities\r\nwithin the various international organizations. It is also\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nhigh time to expand the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil so as to include, fairly and equitably, all\r\nregions of the world. The Arab world should have a\r\npermanent seat in the Council because of its\r\nimportance.\r\nAt this time, on the threshold of the third\r\nmillennium, we look forward to a peaceful and safe\r\nworld, a world in which justice, security and prosperity\r\nreign free of division, war and misery while moving\r\nsmoothly towards change, development and betterment\r\nthat will contribute to the progress of all humanity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Aleksander Kwasniewski, President of the\r\nRepublic of Poland.\r\nPresident Kwasniewski: In history, an end also\r\nmarks a beginning. Now, at the turn of the centuries,\r\nwe have a strong sense that this is happening. History\r\nhas quickened its pace, and the new face of the world is\r\nemerging before our eyes.\r\nMany may find the balance of the passing century\r\ndepressing: two world wars and hundreds of local ones;\r\ntwo ominous totalitarian systems; achievements of\r\nscience drawn in work of destruction; famine; surges of\r\negoism among nations and groups which crushed\r\nindividuals. Yet, the twentieth century has also had its\r\nbrighter pages. Owing to the progress of technology,\r\nmankind has been equipped with new medicines, new\r\nsources of energy and new means of communication.\r\nInternational cooperation has flourished. The world has\r\nlearned to appreciate both its own multi-dimensional\r\ncharacter and the multiplicity of cultures. Freedom,\r\ndemocracy, rule of law, tolerance, as never before in\r\nhistory, have built a common house for millions of\r\npeople.\r\nI am proud to represent a country which has made\r\na substantial contribution to this positive\r\ntransformation. Twenty years ago, the phenomenon of\r\nPolish Solidarity gave rise to a surge which\r\neventually melted the ice of the cold war. In 1989, in\r\nthe wake of the Round Table Talks, at an historic\r\nmeeting of Government and Solidarity-led\r\nopposition, the Poles showed how the will to negotiate\r\nand agreement above divisions could bring about an\r\nhistoric breakthrough. Democracy, reforms,\r\nreconciliation and development have become part and\r\nparcel of Polands everyday life. Ultimately, the whole\r\nof our region of Central Europe emerged as a force of\r\nstability, security, development and progress.\r\nAware of its assets and proportionate to its\r\npotential, Poland participates  and intends to be even\r\nmore actively involved  in the construction of the\r\nnew global order. This has been evidenced, inter alia,\r\nby the participation of thousands of Polish soldiers and\r\nobservers in United Nations peacekeeping missions, by\r\nthe efforts during our chairmanship of the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as\r\nwell as by the Warsaw Declaration, adopted last June,\r\nwhen, together with other democratic countries, we\r\nreiterated our determination to cooperate on the basis\r\nof fundamental values of democracy and human rights.\r\nLet us ask ourselves, let us honestly consider:\r\nHave we really been able to develop and apply\r\nprocedures and instruments to effectively protect\r\nhuman rights? Have we yet found a way to overcome\r\ndivisions between the impoverished South and the\r\nprospering North? Are we able to protect the natural\r\nenvironment? Do we know how to ensure that the era\r\nof inexorable progress of information and\r\ncommunications really favours development of culture\r\nand education, and that it will not transform into an era\r\nof information chaos? In the face of the market diktat,\r\ndo we not lose sight of the human person in his or her\r\nfull dimension, including his or her spiritual values?\r\nThe term globalization has been coined for our\r\nnew interdependence. I represent a country which has\r\nopened itself to the world, emerging as an even more\r\nactive participant in trade, scientific and technological\r\nexchanges. We, in Poland, feel at ease in a world of\r\ncultural interaction and lively contacts between people.\r\nWe should remember, however, that there is also\r\na dark side to globalization. The disparity between\r\npoor and rich countries continues to grow. I am\r\nconvinced that we can succeed in this endeavour only\r\nif we accept that world development must be based on\r\nuniversal values. In this respect, the principle of\r\nsolidarity will have an important role to play.\r\nSolidarity is shared responsibility. It is sensitivity\r\nto the needs and fears of the weaker. It is willingness to\r\ncooperate and to offer support. It is priority of\r\nconcerted efforts over unilateral action. It is respect for\r\ndiversity and dialogue. But, above all, I perceive\r\nsolidarity as freedom, dignity and welfare of the\r\nindividual which are brought into the focus of attention\r\nof all political action and global campaigns. What the\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nworld needs today is a synthesis of the strengths, which\r\nthe free market has undoubtedly demonstrated,\r\ncombined with realistic and people-oriented solutions\r\nwhich have to be introduced into political practice.\r\nThe threshold of the twenty-first century poses a\r\nformidable challenge to the United Nations. The world\r\nhas changed; the concept of international order is\r\ntransforming. Hence the imperative need to reform our\r\nOrganization in order to enable it to face great global\r\nchallenges and, at the same time, to protect the rights\r\nof every person. Within the United Nations, we need\r\nefficient organs, a flexible programme, and effective\r\nuse of resources. Our role  as Heads of State or\r\nGovernment  should be to provide clear guidelines,\r\npolitical support and adequate resources for the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe need our world Organization more than ever\r\nbefore. We must face up to the inevitable: changing\r\nlifestyles, changing ways of communication and of\r\nsatisfying needs. In this new, ever changing world, the\r\nUnited Nations should offer us a sense of stability and\r\npredictability. I am deeply convinced that the United\r\nNations is able to serve mankind in such a way, facing\r\nthe challenges to come in this new twenty-first century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Maldas Adamkus, President of the Republic of\r\nLithuania.\r\nPresident Adamkus: A number of speakers at\r\nthis historic event have already made numerous\r\nconcrete and valuable proposals on ways to adapt the\r\nUnited Nations to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. I hope that the final document of the Summit\r\nwill enhance this process by setting concrete objectives\r\nfor the Organization.\r\nWe cannot expect that the process involving the\r\nrenewal of the United Nations and the increasing role\r\nof the Organization will proceed on an easy and fast\r\ntrack. There might be a great deal of disappointment.\r\nThe most important thing, however, is that the process\r\nbe continuous.\r\nThe United Nations cannot solve all of the\r\nproblems and meet all of the challenges. The success of\r\nour efforts to re-adapt ourselves to new realities will\r\ndepend primarily on the involvement of States and the\r\nregions. The Member States should also play an active\r\nrole in finding ways of addressing the needs of today.\r\nThe United Nations will enhance its influence\r\nwhen some Member States assume a greater share of\r\nresponsibility by making an increased contribution to\r\nthe Organization. On behalf of Lithuania, I would like\r\nto announce that my country is increasing its\r\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nThe development of our region demonstrates that\r\nthe progress made by countries depends directly on the\r\nextent of the efforts made to achieve it. Our own\r\nexperience during the 10 years of our independence has\r\nshown that a liberal democracy, a market economy, an\r\nopen society and respect for human rights are the basic\r\npreconditions necessary for achieving progress in a\r\nshort period of time. Only a very few countries, for\r\nexample those with extensive natural resources, might\r\nignore these principles, but, as history shows, not for\r\nlong.\r\nI believe that in the face of a globalized\r\ntomorrow, the United Nations will increase the scope\r\nof its human-dimension activities. Human rights should\r\nbecome a cornerstone of the emerging world structure.\r\nThe United Nations should advance in the search for\r\nnew and more effective instruments to fend off the\r\nchallengers of human rights.\r\nGlobalization will continue to bring into question\r\nthe limits of human rights applicability. My region is\r\nparticularly interested in how the international\r\ncommunity can promote the rights of people coping\r\nwith a post-communist transition.\r\nTen years of profound transformation have\r\nendowed Central and Eastern European nations with\r\ninvaluable experience. Good-neighbourly relations\r\nhave become an earmark of the region. For instance,\r\ndespite the serious disagreements that have existed in\r\nthe past, the strategic partnership that has evolved\r\nbetween Lithuania and its neighbour Poland is a\r\nremarkable example.\r\nThe cases of the countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope have shown that integration works to the\r\nbenefit of all participating countries and of their\r\nneighbours. Lithuania is working, and will continue to\r\nwork, in the same direction with respect to the part it is\r\nplaying in Euro-Atlantic enlargement.\r\nYet Central and Eastern Europe have to resolve\r\nnumerous issues, which I will call divorce legacies.\r\nIn the process of the disintegration of one dominant\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\npower and one ideology, thousands, if not millions, of\r\npeople are waiting to be compensated for lost lives,\r\nhealth or property. They are looking for justice, which\r\nis perceived as a compensation for their losses in the\r\npast. The United Nations could play a more important\r\nrole in addressing the expectations of such people.\r\nA number of speakers in this forum have\r\nunderlined the importance of the principle of equality\r\namong nations. This is an essential principle of\r\ninternational relations. The leading nations in this\r\nmultipolar environment, however, should also expand\r\ntheir role and take on more responsibilities. The right\r\nleadership can help to find a way out of a deadlocked\r\nsituation. In this light, we note the progress made in the\r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nThe United Nations has a commendable record of\r\nreconciling the differences that stem from our different\r\nbackgrounds. The year 2001 has been proclaimed the\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nIt is a great honour for Lithuania to host, next April,\r\nthe International Conference on Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, which Mr. Koichiro Matsuura, Director-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO), has kindly\r\nagreed to co-chair.\r\nOver the last decades, the concept of civilization\r\nhas outgrown its traditional cultural limits and today\r\nalso involves social and economic values. The global\r\ncommunity is being realigned according to this new\r\nblueprint. But the challenge is greater than that. The\r\ncultural richness that history has bestowed upon us\r\nmust go hand in hand with the progress that\r\nglobalization promotes. We must build a dialogue in a\r\nlanguage acceptable to many. That language, I believe,\r\nshould be based on the principles enshrined in key\r\nUnited Nations instruments, primarily the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This is the real challenge\r\nthat we face now.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Her Excellency Ms. Tarja\r\nHalonen, President of the Republic of Finland.\r\nPresident Halonen: The United Nations needs to\r\nbe more relevant to its Member States, but especially to\r\ntheir peoples. It is important that all individuals sense\r\nthe relevance of the United Nations and support its\r\nmission.\r\nThe United Nations has done, and needs to\r\ncontinue to do, good work for those most in need \r\nwomen, children, minorities and the disabled. The\r\nUnited Nations global conferences have addressed\r\nmany human needs and individuals everyday\r\nconcerns, and we will continue in conferences on\r\nracism, AIDS, and the situation of children. I would\r\nemphasize that We the peoples is the central element\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe United Nations must be essential also in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Here I\r\nspeak about a comprehensive concept of security.\r\nPeace is not only the absence of war. Democracy,\r\nrespect for human rights, the rule of law and good\r\ngovernance are essential for comprehensive security\r\nand development. They are also effective means of\r\ncrisis prevention.\r\nCivilian crisis management should be developed\r\nand strengthened. A competent judiciary, a well-\r\nfunctioning educational system and effective local\r\nadministration are everyday examples. Using the same\r\nelements, post-conflict peace-building consolidates a\r\nnations foundation and prevents the renewal of\r\nconflicts. But we still need traditional peacekeeping,\r\nand therefore we should urgently consider the\r\nrecommendations of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations.\r\nAs much as we must protect people from fear, we\r\nmust protect them from want. We need to make them\r\nfeel secure and respected. Human-centred sustainable\r\ndevelopment is the best means of long-term crisis\r\nprevention. It addresses the structural causes of conflict\r\nand thus builds a solid foundation for lasting peace.\r\nElimination of poverty, respect for human rights and\r\ngender equality are crucial elements in this respect. I\r\nam convinced that there is no peace without sustainable\r\ndevelopment and no development without lasting\r\npeace. They go hand in hand in all parts of the world.\r\nAs a Co-Chairperson of this Summit, I have\r\nnoticed that everybody is speaking about\r\nglobalization  and rightly so, because it is one of our\r\nmajor challenges. The United Nations must make a\r\nserious effort to ensure that all countries and all people\r\ncan enjoy the fruits of globalization.\r\nAnother challenge to the United Nations is how\r\nto use the revolution in information and\r\ncommunication technology to advance development. At\r\nthe same time, the United Nations must continue its\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nwork to improve basic education. We know that to be\r\nable to read and write is still just a dream for millions\r\nof our fellow-citizens. Concerning information and\r\ncommunication technology, the United Nations must\r\nestablish partnerships, including partnerships with the\r\nprivate sector. To the developing countries, this\r\nrevolution offers a chance to make leaps in\r\ndevelopment. Closing the digital divide would help\r\nnarrow the gap between developed and developing\r\ncountries and would help make them more equal\r\npartners in world affairs. Nevertheless, there is no\r\nmagic formula for development. New and old remedies\r\nmust complement one another. Increased assistance\r\nmust focus on individuals and their needs. We must\r\nforgive the debts of the poorest countries and remove\r\nobstacles from their trade.\r\nThe participation of civil society is very\r\nimportant in terms of the relevance of the United\r\nNations. Its input is needed in all United Nations\r\nactivities. Non-governmental organizations have\r\nplayed a crucial role in setting the global agenda. This\r\nparticipation must be extended to civil society as a\r\nwhole, including parliaments, the private sector and the\r\nbusiness community. Their representatives could be\r\nincluded, for instance, in official United Nations\r\ndelegations, as they are in Finlands. Wide international\r\ncooperation among all actors brings the United Nations\r\ncloser to we the peoples. I commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his initiatives on including civil society.\r\nStrengthening the United Nations requires new\r\napproaches to support. In his report entitled We the\r\npeoples (A/54/2000), the Secretary-General presents\r\nan excellent blueprint for the United Nations.\r\nFaced with multifaceted tasks the United Nations\r\nneeds a strong commitment to multilateralism from all\r\nits Members.\r\nWe know the facts. We know what we want. We\r\nknow how to get it. All we need is the will to do it.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): Before I give\r\nthe floor to the next speaker, I should like to draw the\r\nattention of members to a matter concerning the\r\nmaintenance of order in the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThere have been many instances of cellular telephones\r\nringing in the General Assembly Hall while a meeting\r\nwas in progress. The ringing of cellular phones\r\ninterferes with the delivery of statements and disrupts\r\nthe orderly proceeding of the meetings. In that regard, I\r\nurge members of delegations to turn their cellular\r\nphones off or to keep them in silent mode while in the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. I thank members for their\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Alpha Oumar Konaré, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mali.\r\nPresident Konaré (spoke in French): A special\r\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to children\r\nwill be convened in September 2001, and I wish to\r\nbegin my statement with this loving cry from the\r\nUnited Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF): children\r\ncome first; children are our future. We look forward to\r\na future without child soldiers and child victims of\r\narmed conflict; without trafficking in children to\r\nexploit and enslave them; without violence and cruelty\r\nto children; without the exploitation of child labour.\r\nThe future is for children, for children who are better\r\neducated and better cared for.\r\nAnd for the people of Mali, that future must not\r\nbe made in the image of the present, a present of great\r\npoverty in material terms. This situation is not a matter\r\nof fate. It is the result of insufficient payment for our\r\nproducts; of the crushing debt burden; of our growing\r\noil bills; of the lack of investment; and perhaps also of\r\nthe poor management of our economies and of poor\r\neconomic choices  but of inappropriate cooperation\r\npolicies as well.\r\nThere are solutions that can change this situation,\r\nthat can bring about increased income, faster and more\r\nsustained growth and the conditions for sustainable\r\nhuman development. The war on poverty should take\r\naccount of the specific characteristics of each country\r\nand should show respect for the disadvantaged and for\r\nthe thousands of men and women, organizations and\r\ninstitutions that have always been waging that war.\r\nWe have to free up initiatives, especially private\r\ninitiatives and those of civil society and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, to consolidate local\r\nhuman resources and national capacities, to increase\r\nofficial development assistance, and to consider a more\r\ncollective management of hydrocarbons in the spirit of\r\nthe San José Agreement. We must also make greater\r\nuse of the technological revolution and new\r\ninformation technologies.\r\nIn that connection we should pay special attention\r\nto the World Summit on Information Society to be\r\nconvened in 2003 by the International\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nTelecommunication Union with the participation of all\r\nparties concerned.\r\nWe need a climate of freedom and the rule of law\r\nin order to create a context conducive to good\r\ngovernance, to the fight against corruption and to\r\nparticipation by populations in all their diversity,\r\nespecially cultural diversity, in the management of their\r\naffairs and in the free choice of their representatives.\r\nWe must have a clear, unambiguous common\r\nposition that condemns brutal disruption of the\r\ndemocratic process. Military coups cannot be\r\ncondemned in Africa accepted elsewhere. We have to\r\nprevent by all means genocide and flagrant violations\r\nof human rights.\r\nWe must also consider isolating regimes at war\r\nthat refuse mediation efforts by the international\r\ncommunity. We have to fight for greater human\r\nsecurity by condemning the use of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines and the secret nuclear arms race; by fighting\r\nagainst the proliferation of and illicit trafficking in\r\nlight weapons; and by supporting the work of national,\r\nregional and international coalitions which include all\r\nof the actors concerned, including Governments and\r\ncivil societies.\r\nWe have to condemn the physical mutilation of\r\nhuman beings, rejecting any self-proclaimed, so-called\r\nnational amnesty following killings, and rejecting the\r\nculture of impunity.\r\nStrengthening the culture of peace and human\r\nrights education will be the pillar of democratic\r\nprogress and will support the emergence of a truly\r\ndiverse community of democracies that are based on\r\nuniversal principles and far from holding to one single\r\nideology. In this regard, we welcome the creation in\r\nWarsaw last June of the Community of Democracies,\r\nwhich will favour the expansion of democratic\r\nprinciples throughout the world.\r\nDemocratic progress in Africa feeds the\r\nmomentum of regional and subregional integration. It\r\nhas led to the creation of the African Union, which will\r\nenable our continent to be more responsible, to propose\r\nits own true alternatives to its problems and to assert its\r\npresence among all the international organizations. The\r\nAfrican Union will create the conditions for a true\r\npartnership for irreversible globalization \r\nglobalization that is not simply an economic process\r\nand is not synonymous with exclusion, with just the\r\nlogic of the market or with an unbridled quest for profit\r\nand wealth. Globalization will be synonymous with\r\nsharing, with opening up to products from the South\r\nand with social justice. It must have a human face, or it\r\nwill not be for us.\r\nDespite its negative media image of being a\r\ncontinent of wars and of violence that often springs\r\nfrom a lack of democracy, of being a continent of\r\ncalamities and disasters, Africa remains a continent\r\nwith formidable assets, a continent that looks to the\r\nfuture with confidence. Today we intend to take up the\r\nduty of our generation in the struggle against poverty\r\nand disease, in mounting an unprecedented crusade\r\nagainst AIDS in a spirit of solidarity, even overcoming\r\ntaboos, because we will not let ourselves die. Out of\r\nevery ten people who have AIDS, nine are in Africa.\r\nWe also want to take up the duty of our\r\ngeneration to fight ignorance. Education, especially of\r\nyoung people and women, is our top priority. It must\r\nenlighten the new millennium and inaugurate the new\r\ncentury. We also want to fight environmental\r\ndegradation and to preserve our common land.\r\nThe duty of a generation demands the solidarity\r\nof a generation. None of those objectives will be\r\nachieved without a greater democratization of the\r\nUnited Nations, through the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil, so that it becomes more effective and\r\nlegitimate and better represents the States and peoples\r\nof the world. The desired reform should also include\r\nthe effective exercise by the General Assembly, as the\r\nsupreme world forum, of all its prerogatives, and the\r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council so\r\nthat it can play the role entrusted to it by the Charter.\r\nNone of this can be achieved if, at the dawn of\r\nthis new, twenty-first century and of this new, third\r\nmillennium, individuals and peoples are not placed at\r\nthe heart of our concerns. As the Secretary-General has\r\neloquently pointed out, we need to undertake a true\r\ndialogue of civilizations  a dialogue based on\r\nsolidarity, the law, tolerance and remembering; a\r\ndialogue that never forgets slavery, colonialism,\r\nfascism, xenophobia, racism, the fate of Palestine.\r\nGlory to man, and may the United Nations live in\r\na world of peace, solidarity, sharing and social justice.\r\nPlease God that this Millennium Assembly will be a\r\ndecisive step forward.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Frederick J. T. Chiluba, President of the Republic\r\nof Zambia.\r\nPresident Chiluba (Zambia): We have come to\r\nNew York not only to celebrate, but, most important, to\r\nreflect on our achievements in the last millennium and\r\nto ponder our future. This occasion gives us the\r\nopportunity to redefine the working mechanisms of a\r\nUnited Nations which should be people-centred.\r\nIt is regrettable that, so many years after the\r\nestablishment of this body, global peace is still far from\r\nbeing achieved, while the war on want is in dire\r\njeopardy, as the vast majority of the worlds population\r\ncontinues to live in abject poverty. Poverty is not an\r\naccident, but a result of inequitable economic and\r\npolitical interaction in which the weak continue to be\r\ndeprived of resources necessary for development. It is\r\ntotally unacceptable that  in this day and age of\r\nmodern technology and the information\r\nsuperhighway  squalor, misery and disease continue\r\nto ravage millions of our people, especially women and\r\nchildren, who bear the brunt of poverty.\r\nIt is imperative for the international community\r\nto search its moral conscience and focus on this serious\r\nblemish. Measures to address this situation are clear.\r\nThey include improved market access, deep and\r\nbroader debt relief, foreign direct investment and other\r\ncapital inflows, and financial and technical support in\r\nthe multilateral trading system. The launch of the\r\nenhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative by the G-8 countries has had little\r\nimpact on debt and poverty. Eligibility for and access\r\nto the HIPC initiative must be more open in order to\r\nbenefit many more countries that are in desperate need\r\nof support. Development partners that have not done so\r\nshould strengthen their efforts to honour the\r\nlongstanding undertaking to allocate 0.15 per cent of\r\ntheir gross national product as overseas development\r\nassistance to least developed countries, and more\r\ndonors should move towards the 0.2 per cent target.\r\nThe impact of aid has been limited not only by its\r\ndeclining volume, but also by the lack of concrete\r\naction to address the issues of concern to developing\r\ncountries. The world shares a common humanity,\r\nwhose essence must go beyond mere rhetoric to\r\nconcrete action to eliminate the obvious imbalances\r\nthat continue to exacerbate poverty and\r\nmarginalization. The United Nations must as a matter\r\nof urgency give poverty eradication the priority it\r\ndeserves. We must develop clear, action-oriented\r\nprogrammes to combat this scourge, which claims more\r\nvictims than wars. It is futile to claim a common global\r\nhumanity while perpetuating structures of injustice and\r\ninequality.\r\nGiven political will and determination, poverty\r\ncan be eliminated from the face of the world. The\r\nsolutions to this crisis in large measure depend on the\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations itself. In its present\r\nform the United Nations lacks the capacity to respond\r\nadequately to these problems. It is for this reason that\r\nmy Government is calling for recognition of the need\r\nto energize and refocus the Organization as a matter of\r\nurgency, to enable it respond to these challenges. The\r\nUnited Nations should be made more viable in order to\r\nsupport transparency and good governance, improve\r\nhuman rights, preserve the environment, consolidate\r\ndemocracy and improve the standards of living of our\r\npeople. It must be given the capacity to deal with the\r\nserious conditions and circumstances that continue to\r\nafflict the globe.\r\nIt is a contradiction in terms that while we have\r\nbeen championing democratization across the globe,\r\nwe have not been able to democratize the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAs we commemorate the millennium, we should\r\ngive hope to the war-afflicted peoples in many regions\r\nof the world by finding lasting solutions to the causes\r\nof conflicts.\r\nAfrica has been hardest hit by these conflicts. We,\r\nthe members of this family of nations, must speed up\r\nour reaction to such crises. Our slow response has on\r\nmany occasions proved very costly, leading to the loss\r\nof many lives.\r\nWe in Africa have recognized that military and\r\nother unconstitutional upheavals are the major causes\r\nof political instability. As a result, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) has adopted the red card\r\nprinciple, meaning that any OAU member State whose\r\nGovernment comes into power by unconstitutional\r\nmeans will immediately be suspended from the\r\nOrganization until that Government restores\r\ndemocratic rule. The United Nations, in my opinion,\r\nneeds to adopt a similar declaration to eliminate the\r\nunconstitutional removal of elected Governments.\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nMy Government hopes that the unity of purpose\r\nexpressed at this Summit will provide a historic\r\nopportunity to all of us to agree on a process for a\r\nfundamental review of the role of, and challenges\r\nfacing, the United Nations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia.\r\nPresident Mesić (spoke in Croatian) (English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): Time is running short.\r\nThe moments in which we all intuitively feel that\r\nhumankind is at a crucial crossroads are rare indeed.\r\nOne such moment is now.\r\nThe twentieth century was a period of immense\r\nprogress of science and technology. Man has soared\r\ninto the air, stepped on the Moon and reached for the\r\nstars. Man has plunged into the depths of the sea and\r\nhas begun to exploit the submarine world. He has\r\nlinked and shrunk the world by information and\r\ncommunication technologies. At the same time, he has\r\ngained better knowledge, if not awareness, of himself.\r\nThe causes of many diseases and the drugs for their\r\ntreatment have been discovered, and the human\r\ngenome has been mapped.\r\nOn the other hand, the twentieth century was\r\nmarked by two world wars, two authoritarian systems\r\nwith global ambitions, the cold war, the global arms\r\nrace and the bipolar world. But, although a new global\r\nconflict has been avoided, confrontations have\r\nnevertheless remained.\r\nIn such a world  and I am confident that we all\r\nshare this awareness  we must provide full support to\r\nthis global Organization, the United Nations, and\r\nendeavour to make it, through common efforts, the\r\nmost relevant and efficient factor in the present-day\r\nworld, an Organization which every nation will truly\r\nexperience as its own. I have in mind a regenerated\r\nand, in every respect, revitalized United Nations,\r\ncapable of responding to the challenges of the new\r\ncentury and providing the much needed framework for\r\nefforts focused on strengthening security and on the\r\nachievement of progress and prosperity for all.\r\nI believe that this eminent gathering is the\r\nopportunity to welcome the major contribution of the\r\nUnited Nations and, in particular, of the current\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan. We firmly support his\r\nvision of a world befitting man and his fight against\r\nevil, a vision which has systematically inspired him\r\nthroughout his rich career and which is also the point\r\nof departure of his proposal and call for a thorough\r\nreform of the United Nations structure and activity,\r\nincluding the reform of the Security Council and the\r\npeacekeeping operation system, and recognition of the\r\nrole of the General Assembly.\r\nIt is with a sense of pride that I address the\r\nAssembly today on behalf of the Republic of Croatia, a\r\nsmall European country which has experienced war and\r\nis now affected by the many ills of a country\r\nundergoing transition. We need, urge and count on the\r\nassistance of the international community in\r\novercoming the consequences of the war and\r\nstrengthening the institutions of civil society and\r\ndemocracy. Croatia now seeks and is beginning to\r\nachieve its link-up with the Euro-Atlantic integrations\r\nand the European Union. Firmly committed to such\r\nforeign policy goals, we also expect their equally firm\r\nand encouraging support in this endeavour. We are still\r\nfaced with the challenges of issues such as Prevlaka\r\nand the succession to the former Yugoslavia, which\r\nought to be dealt with in accordance with the principle\r\nof the inviolability of internationally recognized\r\nborders, international law and equality.\r\nToday I urge Members again to pool our efforts\r\nand actions, lest we should disappoint the millions of\r\nthose who in the twentieth century gave their lives for a\r\nbetter tomorrow, as well as those who will spend the\r\ngreater part of their lives in the twenty-first century.\r\nLet us help the young in the poor countries, as well as\r\nin the rich countries, to overcome the frustration with\r\nwhich they are currently faced, although for different\r\nreasons. Time is running short; let us set off before it is\r\ntoo late.\r\nThe path ahead is clear. Let us follow the signpost\r\noffered us by the Secretary-General in his report; let us\r\nbreathe life into it. Let us start from the point of\r\ndeparture. Let us secure the recognition of the values of\r\nfreedom, equality and the fundamental rights of States,\r\npeoples and, primarily, individuals. Let us secure the\r\nrecognition of principles, and strengthen the\r\ninstruments and standards of the fight against\r\ndiscrimination, intolerance, supremacy and dependence\r\nof any kind.\r\nLet us harness our forces and endure in our\r\nefforts to curb the arms race, which is wasteful and\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nlethal in every respect. Let us conclude new treaties\r\nand reinforce our support for existing treaties covering\r\nthis field, particularly with regard to mine control and\r\nthe control of small-bore weapons production and\r\ntrade.\r\nLet us espouse the positive achievements and\r\npromises of globalization, and attenuate its negative\r\nimplications by favouring economic relations which\r\nwill provide for the gradual emergence of poor\r\ncountries from their dire predicaments. Let us reform\r\nthe international financial institutions, but let us not, in\r\nthe process, neglect or unilaterally avoid the discipline\r\nand commitments imposed by global interdependence.\r\nLet us fight for the preservation of our rivers,\r\nmountains, seas and oceans, our common heritage on\r\nthis planet. Let us commit ourselves to compliance\r\nwith the undertakings we have assumed, because we\r\nthereby also preserve the basis of our own existence.\r\nIn conclusion, let me call on the Assembly to\r\nconfirm our dedication to peace and to the protection\r\nof all rights of every human being, because relations of\r\ngenuine equality on this global scale can only be\r\nestablished on such a foundation. Human life is the\r\nsupreme value, and this is why we have the right and\r\nthe obligation to stand up in its protection, wherever\r\nand by whomever it may be jeopardized, through our\r\ncommon global Organization.\r\nThe key to the future is in our hands. The future\r\nwill be of our own doing. Let us boldly open the door\r\nof the new century and the new millennium. Let us do\r\nit together, here and now, for the world is at a turning\r\npoint and time is running short.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to thank all those\r\nwho have expressed their sympathy over the tragic\r\ndeath of a Croatian citizen, Pero Simundza, who was\r\nkilled in West Timor in the service of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Leonid\r\nKuchma, President of Ukraine.\r\nPresident Kuchma (spoke in Ukrainian):\r\nSpeaking from this high rostrum, I feel probably the\r\nsame as everybody present here  responsibility,\r\nsolidarity and inspiration. Our participation in the\r\nSummit reaffirms our commitment to and support for\r\nthe foundations of world order, based on the underlying\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. These\r\nprinciples should continue to serve as the basis for the\r\nsystem of international relations in the next\r\nmillennium.\r\nIn historic terms, the United Nations was brought\r\ninto existence not so long ago. Even less time has\r\nelapsed since the creation of the newly independent\r\nStates, including Ukraine. But even within this short\r\nperiod of time we have learned a lot. We know what\r\nthe peoples of our countries want.\r\nLike every people on earth, my compatriots want\r\nto live in a democratic country, without fear for their\r\nfuture and the life and destiny of coming generations. It\r\nhas been from this angle that we perceive the role and\r\nplace of the United Nations in the twenty-first century.\r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons remain one of the essential tasks to be\r\naddressed by the United Nations and the world\r\ncommunity. Not so long ago, Ukraine took an\r\nunprecedented step by renouncing the worlds third\r\nlargest nuclear arsenal. That gesture of goodwill,\r\ndictated by the responsibility for strengthening peace\r\nand for the future of mankind, gives us the right to call\r\nupon other States to follow this way.\r\nI am convinced that nuclear weapons are useless\r\nand unpromising as an instrument of State policy. It is\r\nnecessary to do everything possible to make sure that\r\nin the new millennium mankind gets rid once and for\r\nall of the fear of devastating nuclear disaster. In this\r\nrespect, we support the idea of convening a worldwide\r\ninternational conference to work out ways and means\r\nof eliminating such a threat.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to play a key\r\nrole in maintaining the international peace and security.\r\nIt is quite obvious that such hazardous diseases as\r\nconflicts should be treated long before their eruption. I\r\nbelieve that today, as never before, there is an acute\r\nneed to develop a comprehensive strategy of the United\r\nNations for conflict prevention that should be based on\r\na large-scale use of preventive diplomacy and peace-\r\nbuilding.\r\nIt is on this premise that a peacekeeping\r\nphilosophy of the United Nations and its Member\r\nStates in the next millennium should be built. A secure\r\nand equitable world would be difficult to achieve\r\nwithout resolute and uncompromising response by the\r\nentire world community to new challenges related to\r\nthe process of globalization. It seems that possible\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\ncatastrophic consequences of some of them have not\r\nyet been fully realized.\r\nCompletely sharing the views expressed by\r\nprevious speakers regarding the threat of international\r\nterrorism, I would like to draw particular attention to\r\none of its specific manifestations, international\r\ncomputer terrorism. Unfortunately, criminals and\r\nmalefactors have been increasingly enjoying the\r\nadvantages of the information revolution. I would like\r\nto invite you to consider the appropriateness of\r\nworking out an international instrument to combat\r\ncomputer terrorism.\r\nThe best and most reliable weapon of peace is\r\nsteady economic development. For developing\r\ncountries and countries with economies in transition,\r\nthe main factors for success in economic reforms and\r\npoverty eradication programmes consist in obtaining\r\nfree access to world markets, in liberalizing trade and\r\nresolving external debt problems. It is in this domain\r\nthat both the United Nations and the international\r\nfinancial institutions can launch their initiatives.\r\nEnsuring proper living conditions for future\r\ngenerations from the environmental standpoint is\r\nanother urgent task that requires our joint and\r\nconcerted efforts. In Ukraine, there is a clear\r\nunderstanding of the danger caused by the careless\r\nexploitation of natural resources and the use of new\r\ntechnologies.\r\nOur people have been suffering the consequences\r\nof the largest technological cataclysm of the twentieth\r\ncentury, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident.\r\nWe have made a decision to shut down this nuclear\r\npower plant by December 15th, 2000. This decision\r\ngives us an opportunity to work out a mechanism for\r\nconsolidating efforts at all levels  national, regional\r\nand international  to resolve social, economic and\r\nenvironmental problems that affect the peace and\r\nsecurity of individual countries and of all the\r\nhumankind.\r\nTime requires of all of us to act in unity with\r\nresolve and to assume the responsibility for the future\r\nof the United Nations. In the twenty-first century, the\r\nOrganization should be provided with such capabilities,\r\nfinancial resources and structures that will allow us\r\neffectively to serve those on behalf of whom and for\r\nwhom it was established.\r\nI am convinced that by strengthening the United\r\nNations the world community could significantly\r\nenhance its capacity to withstand the dangers and\r\nthreats, to respond to the challenges of our time and to\r\nensure stability, justice and predictability of\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency, Retired\r\nFlight-Lieutenant, Jerry John Rawlings, President of\r\nthe Republic of Ghana.\r\nPresident Rawlings: The end of one millennium\r\nand the beginning of another marks a focal point for\r\nthe hopes and expectations of peoples across the world.\r\nWhile there were great social and scientific\r\nachievements during the past century, we also have to\r\nadmit that deprivation and inequality continue to grow.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General to this\r\nSummit captures the challenges and the means to\r\naddress them very comprehensively. We support the\r\nthrust of the report, and we call for international\r\ncommitment to urgent action. In todays globalized\r\nworld, we must not only ensure social justice\r\ninternally, but we must also incorporate it in own our\r\nglobal interactions.\r\nThe failure in the past to recognize and apply the\r\nprinciples of equity and justice in international\r\nrelations has determined the present unacceptable\r\nconditions of poverty, marginalization, criminality, the\r\nspread of disease, environmental degradation and\r\nglobal social disorder. Using the economic and\r\ntechnological edge of our millennium and converging\r\nethical world-views, I believe as most of us do, that we\r\ncan reverse these conditions and pursue the objectives\r\nof socially stable global societies, emphasizing trade,\r\ndebt reduction or debt alleviation and the containment\r\nof the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nEducation, particularly access to good quality\r\nbasic education, provides the basis for the building of\r\ntolerant, socially stable communities. We must\r\ntherefore mobilize the $7 billion a year needed to meet\r\nthe educational costs of providing primary education\r\nover the next 10 years for the 130 million children in\r\ndeveloping countries who do not now have access to it.\r\nOur efforts to strengthen education must necessarily\r\ninclude the education and empowerment of women,\r\nwith emphasis on the girl child.\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nAs a leading contributor to United Nations and\r\nregional peacekeeping, Ghana believes that regional or\r\nsubregional efforts to contain conflict can only\r\naugment United Nations efforts to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security. This is best assured if\r\nstructural weaknesses within United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations are addressed.\r\nIf developing countries are to ensure for their\r\npeoples the decent quality of life which flows from a\r\nstable, developed environment, their capacity to govern\r\nresponsibly needs to be reinforced, particularly through\r\nincreased development assistance. The absence of\r\nstrong and resilient institutions in regions like Africa\r\nhas encouraged corruption from within and without.\r\nI should like to speak for a few more minutes on\r\nthe issue of corruption. Corruption is a global\r\nphenomenon. However, Africa, in particular, has\r\nsuffered especially severe damage  materially,\r\nsocially, politically and morally. Seemingly, it is the\r\nonly, or the most, corrupt continent in the world.\r\nAdmittedly, Africa may have had  it probably still\r\nhas  a few notably corrupt and tyrannical leaders and\r\nGovernments. It may also be true that our continent is\r\nnot yet free from this blight, which has drained some of\r\nour countries of resources, both material and human,\r\nwhich should have been used to improve the quality of\r\nlife of the poor and the disadvantaged. Developing\r\ncountries have to check corruption, but we are also\r\nentitled to demand that the developed world does not\r\nthrust corruption upon us.\r\nWhere do the proceeds of this corruption end up\r\nin the long run? They end up in the vaults of the\r\nfinancial and banking institutions of the Western world.\r\nFor every dollar of corrupt money that is kept in\r\nWestern banks, one African child may die, two African\r\nchildren starve and three African children suffer from\r\ndisease and ignorance resulting from lack of health\r\ncare or of education. There will be less corruption in\r\nAfrica if there is no place to hide the proceeds of\r\ncorruption or if the proceeds of corruption  once\r\nuncovered, as has been done  are returned to their\r\nreal owners, the people of Africa, being served by\r\nGovernments of integrity.\r\nCompanies and multinationals that are apparently\r\nreputable are known to engage in underhand deals with\r\nhigh-level officials in order to gain advantages over\r\ntheir competitors or to carry out unethical operations.\r\nRecently one Western company so seriously\r\nundermined a rival company from the same country in\r\na bid for an important water project in my country, by\r\nfalsely impugning its business ethics, that the latter\r\ncompany, which had offered much better terms, pulled\r\nout of the bid. Its withdrawal from the bidding process\r\ndoes not only represent a loss of integrity; it is Ghanas\r\nloss, as the water project still remains on the drawing\r\nboard today. Some of my people will continue to drink\r\nunhealthy water, if they drink any at all.\r\nIn another case of competition between Western\r\ncountries in Europe and in the Americas  countries\r\non both sides of the Atlantic ocean that believe in\r\ndemocracy and pontificate on the subject, and on the\r\nfree market system and competition  questionable\r\narguments based on technical rules of origin, supported\r\nby false declarations by officials sent to my country by\r\none of them in Europe, were employed in order to deny\r\nEuropean market access to a Ghanaian value-added\r\nproduct, just because it was perceived to be an\r\nappendage of an American company. This is a very sad\r\nextension of the Western countries own trade wars.\r\nOnce again, we in the so-called condemned world are\r\nthe ones who suffer.\r\nA World Bank report recently blacklisted 29\r\ncompanies for corruption in contract-awarding\r\nprocedures in an African country. Which country? Our\r\nsister country, Nigeria. The overwhelming majority \r\nmore than 80 per cent  of the corrupt companies\r\nblacklisted by the World Bank, which is a Western\r\ninstitution, incidentally, were not Nigerian companies,\r\nbut were from the very Western world that condemns\r\nus for our corruption.\r\nThat was bad enough. But even worse is the\r\ncorruption of the domestic front men of such\r\ncompanies, whose corrupt moneys continue to be\r\nretained in Western banking and financial institutions\r\nand about whom there is a dead, stony silence.\r\nPoliticians run the risk of being shot in a coup or a\r\nrevolt, or of dying for their alleged corruption. Yet,\r\nwhenever the money is uncovered, I can assure the\r\nAssembly that for every one politician or leader, there\r\ncould be five corrupt African business collaborators\r\nwhose corrupt moneys remain untouched in Western\r\nbanks. Yet, as usual, it is the politicians who always\r\nface the risks.\r\nOnly last week, in an unprecedented diplomatic\r\nfaux pas, a high-ranking Western diplomat in my\r\ncountry openly declared at a public forum that leading\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nWestern companies, including companies from his own\r\ncountry, offer bribes to Government officials in order\r\nto influence the award of contracts. In other words,\r\nWestern Governments know about the corruption of\r\ntheir countries companies operating in my continent of\r\nAfrica, yet keep dead quiet about it. This is not good\r\nenough.\r\nQuestionable and dubious mergers and\r\nacquisitions are putting enterprises in Africa and the\r\ndeveloping world, and even in the developed world\r\nitself, out of business.\r\nI am convinced that Africas political\r\nindependence will remain meaningless unless it is\r\nreflected in a transparent Africa, a corruption-free\r\nAfrica, an accountable Africa and a trusted Africa. But\r\nthe temptations of the developed world must stop, if\r\nthis vision is to be achieved.\r\nFinally, the ongoing reform of our Organization\r\nmust aim at achieving a world body that is\r\ndevelopment-oriented and representative, and take into\r\naccount that that representation should not leave out\r\nresponsibilities at the Security Council level. It also\r\nmust become democratic and responsive. Making and\r\nusing the United Nations as a real forum of the people,\r\nresponsive to the global challenges of our time, will be\r\nour challenge as we embark on a new millennium.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Hugo\r\nChávez Frías, President of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela.\r\nPresident Chávez Frías (spoke in Spanish):\r\nVenezuela and its Bolivarian people salute this\r\nMillennium Summit and, through it, all the peoples and\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nTwo millenniums ago, Jesus Christ came to fight\r\nfor justice, for peace, for dignity and for life. He died\r\ncrucified. Five hundred years ago, the encounter and\r\nthe conflict between civilizations were accelerated\r\nthrough a savage process of conquest, colonization,\r\nexploitation and domination. Fifty-five years ago, the\r\nUnited Nations was created in order to fight for\r\nsecurity, equality and the happiness of peoples.\r\nSince Jesus last supper so long ago in the\r\nyear 33, up to this Millennium Summit of 2000, how\r\nmany summits have men held! It sometimes seems that\r\nwe jump from summit to summit while our peoples\r\nkeep moaning from abyss to abyss. Despite fighters\r\nsuch as Christ, the good intentions of colonizers such\r\nas Father de las Casas and the good will of many in the\r\nUnited Nations during the past half-century, todays\r\nworld remains marked and burdened by misery,\r\ninequality, hunger and death.\r\nSimón Bolívar, the liberator of South America\r\nand the leader who inspired the revolution that is\r\ntaking place today in Venezuela, dreamed one day, in\r\nhis vision for justice, dreamed about scaling the\r\nChimborazo summit. There, over the perpetual snows\r\nof the spine of the Andes, he imagined that he met\r\nFather Time, a wise, long-bearded old man. Following\r\na dialogue on that peak, Father Time told him: Go and\r\ntell the truth to man.\r\nToday, I have come here as the standard-bearer of\r\nthat Bolivarian dream to proclaim to the United\r\nNations and the world: Let us tell the truth to man. Let\r\nus give meaning to the word truth. We have two\r\ninterpretations that are commonly accepted by many\r\nphilosophical schools to define truth. The first holds\r\nthat truth is not an abstraction or a dream. The truth is\r\nsomething that is happening at this very moment to\r\nevery one of us and to all of our people. The second\r\nholds that truth is the only thing that links us to the\r\nwhole, to all humankind. The Indian philosopher Jiddu\r\nKrishnamurti said that the truth is not static, a fixed\r\npoint. The truth moves; it is a dynamic that goes many\r\nways.\r\nOf course, the United Nations was created in a\r\nhistoric moment. We were emerging from the horror of\r\nthe Second World War and, under the looming threat of\r\nconflict, humankind rallied around that truth in order to\r\nput an end to that infernal human butchery in which\r\nmillions died. But this truth has been left behind. It is\r\nno longer the truth today and has disappeared with\r\ntime. The time has come at this Millennium Summit to\r\nmake that truth a creative hope, a colossal challenge.\r\nLet us leave it behind. We cannot keep clinging\r\nstubbornly to a truth that is no longer true, that was\r\nvalid at only one moment of history.\r\nOf course, in the world today, millions of people\r\ncontinue to die every day, but not as a result of bombs\r\nor world wars. The truth is different today. Millions are\r\ndying today as a result of hunger, inequality,\r\nexploitation and poverty. Death is triumphant\r\nthroughout the planet even as we meet here. That is\r\nwhy Venezuela adds it voice to the clamour of the\r\nwretched of the Earth, as Frantz Fanon would say, to\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\ncall for a structural transformation of the United\r\nNations, a radical change of the Organization.\r\nWe must democratize and expand the Security\r\nCouncil so that we can find the truth for all. The truth\r\ncannot be imposed by a minority, because then it would\r\nnot be the truth. We would be living a lie of imposition\r\nand inequality. Venezuela joins that cry. Only in this\r\nway, can we the people begin to emerge from this abyss\r\nand scale the heights. A new world compact of the\r\nUnited Nations is necessary. We need a new democratic\r\nconsensus in the United Nations. Venezuela joins that\r\ncry.\r\nWe must build on this new reality and on the new\r\nmoment in which we are living. Only in this way can\r\nwe hear the voices of the silent. I could have dispensed\r\nwith these five minutes this morning and spared\r\nrepresentatives the time of listening to me. I might\r\nhave taken only three seconds. Why do I say three\r\nseconds? Because, according to statistics, every three\r\nseconds a child dies of hunger in this world. One, two,\r\nthree: that is our truth.\r\nIt is said in the Bible that those who have eyes\r\nmust see and those who have ears must hear. Let me\r\nsay that those who have a heart should listen to the\r\ncries of the wretched of the Earth. Only in this way can\r\nwe comply with the dictum laid down in the Book of\r\nEcclesiastes: For everything there is an appointed\r\ntime, ...and an appropriate time for every matter on\r\nEarth. (The Holy Bible, Ecclesiastes, 3:1)\r\nOn this planet, let us build our new truth and act\r\nso that we may say that the time of the people has\r\ncome. This is the call of Venezuela, on behalf of the\r\nBolivarian peoples and of humanity: let us save the\r\nworld!\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Heydar Aliyev, President of the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nPresident Aliyev (spoke in Russian): The\r\ntwentieth century is coming to an end. Humankind will\r\nrecall this century with its spiritual and intellectual\r\nprogress, two bloody world wars, the collapse of\r\nempires and the emergence of dozens of new sovereign\r\nStates, the tensions of the cold war and the collective\r\nefforts towards peace and stability. What will the world\r\nlook like in the coming century? The relegation of the\r\nconfrontation of two systems to the pages of history\r\nand the prevalent expansion of ideas of democracy and\r\nmarket economy should contribute to building the kind\r\nof world where the interests of all States are taken into\r\naccount and a genuine equal partnership is established.\r\nHowever, an analysis of the development of the\r\ninternational environment leads us to the bitter\r\nconclusion that stereotypes of rivalry are still alive. We\r\nare living through a very uneasy period, where a single\r\nwrong step could create an explosion of a situation and\r\nlead to a tragic return to the past. We face the challenge\r\nof treading a difficult path towards building a just and\r\nsecure world order, and we all need to strive to achieve\r\nthat goal.\r\nThe main trend at the present stage of the worlds\r\ndevelopment is globalization. We are all concerned\r\nabout the prospects of this complex and ambiguous\r\nphenomenon. Globalization should contribute to\r\nensuring sustainable development, integrity and a\r\nstability of systems for governing nations, to overcome\r\ndiscrimination in economic relations and to improve\r\nthe welfare of peoples.\r\nThe supremacy of the principles and norms of\r\ninternational law, the evolutionary character of\r\nchanges, partnership and support by the more advanced\r\nnations to less developed States, mutual trust and\r\nrecognition of national distinctions in light of the\r\ncommitment to values cherished by all humanity\r\nshould be the determining vectors of this process. The\r\nstrength of democratic development is in its diversity.\r\nAzerbaijan is making its contribution to the\r\npositive development of globalization. Using its\r\ngeographic location, resources and potential, which are\r\nof geo-strategic importance to the whole world, my\r\ncountry has been effectively playing the role as a\r\nbridge between East and West, originating from a rich\r\nhistorical past and aimed towards the future. We are\r\nmaking enormous efforts to restore the Great Silk\r\nRoad, to create the Europe-Caucasus-Asia transport\r\ncorridor, to develop and export the hydrocarbon\r\nresources of the Caspian basin to world markets. These\r\nprojects are of crucial importance for a free and fully-\r\nfledged development of nations in several regions of\r\nthe world. They will give impetus to transnational\r\ncooperation and have a decisive impact on the\r\ndevelopment of the global environment.\r\nHowever, external threats and internal problems,\r\npressures and involvement in the struggle for spheres\r\nof influence have not allowed young and fragile\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\ndemocracies an opportunity to freely carry out the\r\npolicy that would meet the interests and expectations of\r\ntheir peoples to strengthen and develop their statehood\r\nand to be involved in peaceful development. From the\r\nfirst days of their existence, they were forced to fight a\r\nhard battle for independence, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity. States which have suffered from\r\nacts of aggression, seizure of territories and ethnic\r\ncleansing, aggressive separatism and terrorism, rightly\r\nexpect maximally effective action from the United\r\nNations to establish a just and secure world, and to\r\nprotect the principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nUnfortunately, the South Caucasus has become a\r\nregion where all these problems, threats and risks have\r\nbecome stark realities. The main destabilizing factor in\r\nthe situation in the South Caucasus has been aggression\r\nby Armenia against Azerbaijan; this has brought\r\nincalculable tragedies to millions of people. As a result\r\nof this aggression, Armenian armed forces have\r\noccupied 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan,\r\ncarried out ethnic cleansing and expelled one million\r\nAzerbaijanis from their homes. The Security Council of\r\nthe United Nations passed four resolutions in this\r\nrespect, unequivocally confirming the sovereignty,\r\nterritorial integrity and the inviolability of the frontiers\r\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan, and which\r\nunconditionally demanded the immediate withdrawal\r\nof the Armenian armed forces from the occupied lands\r\nof Azerbaijan. But, since 1993, and until now, the\r\nSecurity Councils decisions remain a dead letter.\r\nSince 1992, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been engaged in\r\nthe settlement of the conflict between Armenia and\r\nAzerbaijan, but its activities have not been successful.\r\nBilateral discussions between the Presidents of\r\nAzerbaijan and Armenia continue, but they, too, have\r\nnot brought about any results yet. We have had a\r\nceasefire for the last six years, but it is not a solution to\r\nthe problems.\r\nI appeal to the United Nations to take all\r\nnecessary measures to implement the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. Without a settlement to the\r\nconflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and other\r\nconflicts; without the removal of factors of external\r\npressure, including foreign military presence, it is\r\nimpossible to achieve peace and security in the region.\r\nIf the South Caucasus were to acquire political\r\nintegrity and neutral status, it would permit the\r\nestablishment of normal mutual relations among the\r\nStates of the South Caucasus and ensure their\r\nharmonious integration into the world economic\r\nsystem.\r\nI extend my gratitude to the organizations within\r\nthe framework of the United Nations and to the donor\r\ncountries for their assistance to Azerbaijani refugees\r\nand displaced persons who have already been living in\r\na state of poverty for over eight years. We feel an acute\r\nneed for the continuation and increase of critically\r\nimportant humanitarian assistance until they can return\r\nto their homes.\r\nThe United Nations has a great responsibility for\r\npeace in the world. We pin our hopes on the United\r\nNations. Serious and rational reforms should increase\r\nthe effectiveness of the Organization, in particular of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nFinally, I would like to underline our collective\r\nresponsibility for peace and security on the planet and\r\nexpress our assurance that the results of the\r\nMillennium Summit will be a reliable basis for our\r\njourney into the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Majesty King\r\nHarald V, head of State of the Kingdom of Norway.\r\nKing Harald V: We must invest in the United\r\nNations. We must give it the strength and resources it\r\nneeds to accomplish the tasks we have assigned it. We\r\nowe it to our forefathers, who made it the object of\r\ntheir highest hopes and aspirations. We owe it to our\r\nchildren and grandchildren, whose future has been\r\nplaced in our hands. We owe it to ourselves, because\r\nour generation has been entrusted with the knowledge\r\nto make the right decisions and the means to carry\r\nthem out.\r\nThe United Nations rose from the ashes of the\r\nSecond World War  from the recognition that our\r\npowers of destruction had reached the point where\r\npeace was the only option. The advent of nuclear\r\nweapons reinforced this realization.\r\nYet the bloodletting, devastation and misery of\r\narmed conflict are still very much a reality in Europe,\r\nin the Americas, in Asia and in Africa. The United\r\nNations should be empowered to deal effectively with\r\nthe changing nature of conflict, to detect the seeds of\r\nconflict at an early stage, to manage conflict where it\r\ncannot be prevented, to mandate and equip United\r\nNations peace operations that can deal with the\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\ncomplex nature of modern conflict. The United Nations\r\nshould be empowered to provide post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation, to alleviate the suffering and protect the\r\nrights of innocent civilians, of innocent women and\r\nchildren, to punish genocide, war crimes and crimes\r\nagainst humanity.\r\nIt is essential to eliminate the causes of armed\r\nconflict. Most of them are closely linked to poverty,\r\nunderdevelopment, and to the violation of human\r\nrights. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has long\r\nrecognized these linkages by awarding the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize not only to the United Nations peacekeeping\r\nforces, but also to the International Labour\r\nOrganization, the United Nations Childrens Fund, and\r\ntwice to the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees.\r\nThe fight to eliminate poverty is the overriding\r\nchallenge of the international community at the turn of\r\nthe millennium. The Secretary-General is advancing\r\nnot only the cause of development, education and\r\nhealth; not only the cause of peace; not only the cause\r\nof human rights and empowerment; but all three. They\r\nare inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing.\r\nWe have all agreed on the goals for international\r\ndevelopment. We have the knowledge to achieve them,\r\nand we have the resources to achieve them. We live in\r\nan age of unparalleled promise and prosperity. We will\r\nnot be forgiven  and we should not be forgiven  if\r\nwe fail to fulfil this promise, if we fail to share this\r\nprosperity with the neediest among us.\r\nThe elimination of poverty is not only a bridge to\r\npeace and development, not only a bridge to human\r\nrights and individual dignity, but also a bridge to the\r\npreservation of the environment for future generations.\r\nFor we shall never be able to cooperate effectively on\r\nhow to husband the scarce resources of our planet, how\r\nto prevent the degradation of the environment, as long\r\nas so many are trapped in hopeless poverty.\r\nSo let us respond to the Secretary-Generals call\r\nfor a strengthened and revitalized United Nations not\r\nwith indifference or pessimism, but with the resolve\r\nand determination it merits. I pledge that my country\r\nwill do so, and together we will succeed.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Alhaji\r\nAhmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the Republic of\r\nSierra Leone.\r\nPresident Kabbah: Let me first of all pay tribute\r\nto all those who have lost their lives in the cause of\r\npeace under the United Nations flag.\r\nOur world Organization comprises independent\r\nsovereign States. But the United Nations is about\r\npeople, all people, irrespective of their colour, creed, or\r\nsocial and economic status.\r\nWe therefore commend our Secretary-General for\r\nreminding us that the United Nations is for and about\r\npeople, about their welfare, their safety and security,\r\nand about their future. He has done so by choosing We\r\nthe peoples as the title of his Millennium report, a\r\ndocument in which he provided us with not just an\r\nagenda for the years ahead, but concrete\r\nrecommendations for our collective action on behalf of\r\nthe peoples of the world. We must try harder, in the\r\nwords of the United Nations Charter,\r\nto employ international machinery for the\r\npromotion of the economic and social\r\nadvancement of all peoples.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, we have come\r\nto realize that the tasks of this Organization have\r\nbecome more difficult. Most of the problems and issues\r\nthat the United Nations was created to tackle just over\r\nhalf a century ago have taken different forms and\r\ndimensions. They have become more complex and\r\nmore challenging. Many of them seem to have become\r\nimmune to the prescriptions and remedies we have\r\ndeveloped over the years to tackle, resolve or eradicate\r\nthem.\r\nIn several parts of the world, we have been\r\nwitnessing the emergence of renewed manifestations of\r\npolitical and social repression, ethnic intolerance, racist\r\ntendencies, and rampant economic inequality. A few\r\nyears ago, the concern was about the so-called cold\r\nwar. Today we are being confronted by widespread\r\nhot wars  real wars that continue to take a heavy\r\ntoll on the lives of millions of people.\r\nHow then do we act on the challenges of the new\r\ncentury? How can the United Nations help meet the\r\nchallenges that the Secretary-General has identified in\r\nhis Millennium report? In my view, the answers lie in\r\nthe process of adaptation.\r\nThe United Nations must adapt and re-equip itself\r\nto deal with the new manifestation of the perennial\r\nproblems of human insecurity and underdevelopment.\r\nIn many instances, we have to develop new approaches\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nand new people-centred strategies for addressing the\r\nemerging and complex issues ahead.\r\nIn several ways, Sierra Leone has tested the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to adapt and to deal\r\nwith some of the challenges of the new century. For\r\nexample, in the areas of human rights protection and\r\nthe administration of justice, the United Nations has\r\nbeen called upon to adapt to a unique situation by\r\ndevising an innovative process of dealing with the\r\nphenomenon of impunity. The people of Sierra Leone\r\ncalled upon the United Nations for assistance, and the\r\nOrganization responded positively with respect to the\r\nestablishment of a special court to bring to justice\r\npersons who may have committed gross violations of\r\nhuman rights and grave offences in violation of\r\ninternational law and domestic criminal law.\r\nIn the area of conflict management, the\r\nGovernment of Sierra Leone recently accepted a\r\nSecurity Council ban, albeit a temporary one, on the\r\nexport of Sierra Leone diamonds. Although this has\r\nresulted in the loss of much needed revenue, we did it\r\nin order to strengthen the Organizations capacity to\r\ndeal with a new menace to international peace and\r\nsecurity, especially in Africa: the menace of conflict\r\ndiamonds. We welcome the proposal of the United\r\nKingdom to place the issue on the agenda of the\r\nMillennium Assembly.\r\nAlso in the area of conflict management, Sierra\r\nLeone expects to host more than 16,000 United Nations\r\npeacekeepers in one of the largest operations the\r\nUnited Nations has ever undertaken. May I, on behalf\r\nof all the people of Sierra Leone, take this opportunity\r\nto express my profound gratitude to the Security\r\nCouncil for giving the United Nations Mission in\r\nSierra Leone (UNAMSIL) additional responsibilities\r\nwithin its current mandate. Our thanks go also to those\r\ncountries that have contributed troops and other\r\nresources to UNAMSIL. Their efforts have given true\r\nmeaning to the term collective security. The situation\r\nin Sierra Leone as it developed demanded an\r\nappropriate response from our Organization, an\r\norganization that has pledged in its Charter to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war.\r\nAs we cross the threshold of the new millennium,\r\nthe international community must rededicate itself to\r\nthe pursuit of peace and human security in all its forms.\r\nAs the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair,\r\nsuggested yesterday, nowhere is this need for\r\nrededication more pronounced than in Africa, the most\r\ndisadvantaged continent on our planet today.\r\nWe must, as a community of nations, redouble\r\nour efforts to eliminate the root causes of internal\r\nconflict. We must do so in the realization that internal\r\nconflict in any part of the world represents a threat to\r\nthe rest. The evidence is overwhelming, whether it\r\ninvolves efforts to combat terrorism, contain health\r\nhazards such as malaria and HIV/AIDS or end ethnic\r\nintolerance. The universality of human security\r\ndemands collective responsibility on the part of all\r\nnations.\r\nThere are, of course, various dimensions of\r\nhuman security. But for many States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, including Sierra Leone, the most\r\npervasive threat to human security is internal conflict.\r\nThe traditional approaches to this phenomenon are no\r\nlonger adequate. We in Sierra Leone have experienced\r\nthe linkage between armed conflict and issues of\r\nhuman security. While we welcome, for instance,\r\nrecent decisions by the Security Council in the area of\r\npeace and security, we strongly believe that these\r\nshould be accompanied by even more innovative\r\nresponses by our development partners, and in\r\nparticular by international financial and development\r\ninstitutions.\r\nInternal security and stability are the most critical\r\nbases for economic and social development. Orthodox\r\nprescriptions for re-launching the economies of post-\r\nconflict countries do not go far enough. The Bretton\r\nWoods institutions advise us, no doubt with good\r\nintentions, to invest in the education and health of our\r\npeoples. But we submit that such advice should not\r\nbecome conditionalities to the detriment of national\r\nsecurity, for without security  as in the case of my\r\ncountry  even limited socio-economic gains could be\r\nswept away virtually overnight. The normal rules and\r\nprocedures for development cooperation require greater\r\nflexibility to enable rapid and viable action for\r\nrehabilitating post-conflict countries. Such action will\r\nencourage and inspire those who have been misled and\r\nwho have resorted to violence to give up their weapons\r\nof war and return to normal life as responsible citizens.\r\nMeeting the challenges of the new millennium\r\nrequires us to accept the fact that Government action\r\nalone cannot solve all our problems. Partnership in one\r\nform or another is required. This Summit, the largest\r\nassembly of world leaders, affords us the opportunity\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nto re-examine our priorities, redefine our mission,\r\nsharpen our vision of the new century and provide the\r\npolitical platform on which the United Nations family\r\ncan place its priority programmes for alleviating or\r\nimproving the human condition throughout the world.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica.\r\nPresident Mbeki: We have gathered at this\r\nimportant place to discuss what we might do together\r\nto address the problems that confront our common\r\nworld. The billions of people we represent expect that a\r\nstrong, clear, unequivocal and understandable message\r\nof hope will come out of this historic Millennium\r\nSummit. We will certainly have to jostle with the\r\nvarious pagan gods at whose feet we prostrate\r\nourselves, over all of whom tower the gods of inertia,\r\nof the market and of globalization.\r\nScattered through the second millennium were\r\nterrible human-made moments of anti-human actions\r\nthat brought great pain and misery to millions of\r\npeople. Slavery was one of these. Colonialism was\r\nanother, as was apartheid. The world wars were other\r\nsuch moments. The Holocaust carried out by Nazi\r\nGermany was such a human-made moment, as was the\r\nmore recent genocide visited upon the people of\r\nRwanda only six years ago. For many of us, all this\r\ndeliberate and savage violence against human beings\r\nrepresents history, things that have come and gone. We\r\nchoose to forget them, allowing the dead to bury the\r\ndead.\r\nHowever, none of us can forget the living, whose\r\nmandates have given us the privileged possibility of\r\nspeaking from this podium. Billions among the living\r\nstruggle to survive in conditions of poverty, deprivation\r\nand underdevelopment. These conditions are as\r\noffensive to everything humane as anything we decry\r\nabout the second millennium.\r\nThe poor of the world stand at the gates of the\r\ncomfortable mansions occupied by each and every\r\nKing, Queen, President, Prime Minister or Minister\r\nprivileged to attend this unique meeting. The question\r\nthese billions ask is, What are you doing? You in\r\nwhom we have placed our trust, what are you doing to\r\nend the deliberate and savage violence against us,\r\nwhich every day sentences many of us to a degrading\r\nand unnecessary death?\r\nThose who stand at the gates are desperately\r\nhungry for food, through no fault of their own. They\r\ndie from preventable diseases through no fault of their\r\nown. They have to suffer a humiliating loss of human\r\ndignity they do not wish on anybody, including the\r\nrich.\r\nThese are the victims of the systemic violence\r\nagainst human beings that we accept as normal, and for\r\nwhich we judge the second millennium adversely. And\r\nyet, that millennium created the conditions for us to\r\nend this modern tragedy. Part of the naked truth is that\r\nthe second millennium provided humanity with the\r\ncapital, the technology and the human skills to end\r\npoverty and underdevelopment throughout the world.\r\nAnother part of that truth is that we have refused to use\r\nthis enormous capacity to end the contemporary,\r\ndeliberate and savage violence of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nOur collective rhetoric conveys promise. The\r\noffence is that our actions communicate the message\r\nthat, in reality, we do not care. We are indifferent. Our\r\nactions say the poor must bury the poor.\r\nThe fundamental challenge that faces this\r\nMillennium Summit is that, in a credible way, we must\r\ndemonstrate the will to end poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment in Africa and elsewhere. We must\r\ndemonstrate the will to succeed, such as was\r\ndemonstrated by those who died in the titanic struggle\r\nagainst Nazism and fascism, giving birth to this\r\nOrganization.\r\nIf we took this epoch-making decision, it would\r\nnot be difficult to arrive at the practical decisions about\r\nwhat we need to do to make the United Nations an\r\neffective, twenty-first century organization. Thus\r\nwould we end its slide into a somewhat debased state\r\nthat becomes a source of problems rather than a critical\r\ncontributor to the urgent solutions we must find. In this\r\nregard, we will have to ensure that the poor play their\r\nrole not as recipients of largesse and goodwill, but as\r\nco-determinants of what happens to the common\r\nuniverse of which they are an important part. The\r\nessential question we have to answer at this\r\nMillennium Summit is whether we have the courage\r\nand the conscience to demonstrate that we have the will\r\nto ensure that we accept no situation that will deny any\r\nhuman community its dignity.\r\nI, like the poor at our gates, ask the question,\r\nWill we, at last, respond to this appeal? All of us,\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nincluding the rich, will pay a terrible price if we do not\r\nanswer practically, Yes, we do.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Petru\r\nLucinschi, President of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nPresident Lucinschi (spoke in Romanian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Today, at the\r\nintersection of centuries and millenniums, it is natural\r\nto cast a critical glance over the past in order to have a\r\nclearer outlook for the future. The truth is that many\r\nthings have changed for the better in recent years. The\r\nworld has become more homogeneous. The feeling of\r\ninferiority, by which the destinies of many nations have\r\nbeen marked, is disappearing now. At the moment\r\nwhen the United Nations was founded, two thirds of its\r\npresent Members were not yet independent States.\r\nFurthermore, in Eastern Europe, of which the Republic\r\nof Moldova is a part, the number of countries has\r\ndoubled.\r\nAt the same time, we have to recognize that the\r\nprocess of détente is being accompanied by the\r\nproliferation of local conflicts, and poverty has reached\r\nhuge proportions. Under these conditions, apart from\r\nthe efforts that every State has to make on its own, only\r\na strong United Nations will be able to offer us equal\r\nopportunities for development, by diminishing the gap\r\nbetween prosperity and poverty and by encouraging the\r\nnew democratic processes. In this respect, there is a\r\nneed for a deeper definition and more rigorous\r\nobservation of the rules of conduct at the international\r\nlevel, where the United Nations has to play a central\r\nrole.\r\nOne of the main objectives of the United Nations\r\nin the new millennium will be more efficient\r\nmanagement of the advances in the fields of\r\ninformation and high technology, so that they can be\r\nmaintained within the framework of the development\r\nof civilization. In this connection, it is necessary to\r\nadopt and to implement strictly the guarantee measures\r\nof the nuclear security system in order to decrease the\r\nsize of the more and more sophisticated arsenals,\r\nguided by the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic\r\nMissile Systems.\r\nThe adaptation of the United Nations to the new\r\nrealities corresponds entirely to our common interests.\r\nHowever, we have to recognize that, although the\r\naccomplishment of these objectives will require efforts\r\nfrom every Member State, the major role is to be\r\nplayed, as before, by the big States. Albert Einstein\r\nused to say that powerful States need no ambassadors,\r\ntheir force speaks for itself. As for small States, it does\r\nmatter how they express themselves. Being realistic,\r\nwe realize that the security of the twenty-first century\r\nwill depend on how the big States succeed in\r\nunderstanding and cooperating with each other and on\r\nthe degree of harmonization of their interests. At the\r\nsame time, we would like this to take place under\r\nconditions of respect for small States legitimate\r\ninterests.\r\nThere is no doubt that, as the Secretary-General\r\nhas mentioned in the millennium report, all members of\r\nthe international community should take advantage of\r\nthe opportunities of globalization. For this purpose we\r\nhave to find the corresponding modalities to mobilize\r\nall societies, Governments and international financial\r\nresources. Only in this way is it possible to build a\r\nstable and prosperous world, no matter from which\r\npoint of the compass one is looking.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova reaffirms its support\r\nfor the further development of the reform process of\r\nthe United Nations, in particular of the Security\r\nCouncil. We support a moderate increase in the number\r\nof permanent and non-permanent Council members and\r\nensuring better representation of the Member States,\r\nboth the developed and the developing ones.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova  a small State\r\nconfronting transition problems; a State whose\r\nterritorial integrity is being threatened by the conflict\r\nin the eastern regions, caused by the collapse of the\r\nSoviet Union; a State facing difficulties as a result of a\r\nseries of natural disasters that happened this year \r\nsees in the United Nations a hope, a support and a\r\nguarantee of the development of every country.\r\nToday the United Nations faces a new era, in\r\nwhich imagination and creativity must be matched by\r\nwell tempered optimism and authentic pragmatism. The\r\n189 Member States of the United Nations which\r\npresently grant personality and substance to the\r\nOrganization undoubtedly possess the material and\r\nintellectual resources, as well as the political will,\r\nnecessary for the achievement of certain projects\r\nserving the general interests of mankind. The Republic\r\nof Moldova supports the provisions of the Final\r\nDeclaration of the Summit and joins the international\r\ncommunity in its wish to create a better, peaceful and\r\nprosperous world.\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Gnassingbé Eyadéma, President of the Togolese\r\nRepublic.\r\nPresident Eyadéma (Togo) (spoke in French):\r\nFrom this prestigious podium, I first welcome the\r\nfelicitous initiative of the Secretary-General to convene\r\nthis year the Millennium Summit, at which we are\r\nasked to examine the role of the United Nations in the\r\nworld at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This\r\nextremely relevant initiative comes at a time when the\r\nworld is entering an era of great change, with the end\r\nof the cold war and the dazzling development of\r\ninformation technology.\r\nThese transformations command our attention.\r\nThey invite us to review the way in which we work and\r\norganize ourselves, so that we may acquire new and\r\nmore effective instruments and institutions more suited\r\nto the new world realities.\r\nThe institution we have created for ourselves has\r\nstood the test of time, despite the storms and hurricanes\r\nthat it has had to brave. It has held firm because its\r\nfoundations are solid, but this does not mean that it\r\ndoes not need to be revitalized.\r\nIt is in this context that I would like to mention\r\ntwo important areas whose image I think the United\r\nNations should transform: on the one hand,\r\npeacekeeping, and, on the other, development.\r\nFor a number of years many voices have been\r\nraised condemning the fact that the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council, the body to which the Charter\r\nentrusts in Article 24 the primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nno longer reflects current power relationships in the\r\nworld. As the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, says\r\nin his report, its composition ... today does not fully\r\nrepresent either the character or the needs of our\r\nglobalized world. (A/54/2000, para. 44).\r\nWhen the United Nations was created in 1945,\r\ntwo thirds of the current Member States were not\r\nindependent. The worlds population was 2.5 billion.\r\nToday, it is close to 6 billion. Africa, whose population\r\nis over 700 million, is made up of 53 of the 189\r\nMember States of the United Nations. Over a third of\r\nthe Security Councils debates and deliberations deal\r\nwith Africa.\r\nWe therefore believe that it is high time to review\r\nthe Councils composition in order to allow new\r\npermanent members to be chosen from among the new\r\neconomic Powers that have emerged since the Second\r\nWorld War, to be joined by developing country regional\r\nPowers.\r\nFurthermore, the emergence of new types of\r\nconflicts in recent years requires us to better design\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and to make\r\nthem more effective. Otherwise, the United Nations\r\nwould be weakened in its peace missions, as we were\r\nable to see in Bosnia, and more recently in Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General has set\r\nup a high-level Panel that has prepared a report on all\r\naspects of peacekeeping operations. Chaired by the\r\nformer Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria,\r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, that Panel made very important\r\nrecommendations in the report submitted to the\r\nSecretary-General on 17 August.\r\nWe firmly support recommendation 3, contained\r\nin annex III of the report, according to which United\r\nNations peacekeeping forces, once deployed, must be\r\nable to fulfil their mandate professionally and\r\nsuccessfully. They must also be capable of defending\r\nthemselves and of controlling those on the ground who\r\nwould try to undermine their action by violence.\r\nWe also support recommendation 4, requesting\r\nthat the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping\r\nforces be clear, credible and achievable. We also wish\r\nthese operations to be adequately financed. We hope\r\nthat the Security Council and the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations will consider favourably the\r\nrecommendations of the Brahimi report, and will\r\nensure that they are implemented rapidly.\r\nIn the area of development, it is clear that\r\nmultinational and transnational corporations play a\r\ncrucial role today in world economic affairs. But they\r\nare noticeably absent from the United Nations\r\neconomic forums.\r\nIn the same way as work is carried out within the\r\nInternational Labour Organization with the active\r\nparticipation of Government representatives, employers\r\nand employees, I believe that it would be desirable,\r\nwithin the Economic and Social Council, for\r\nGovernment representatives to come together with\r\nrepresentatives of multinational corporations, who\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nwield so much influence in the economic sphere. The\r\neffectiveness and the impact of that important United\r\nNations body could also be enhanced in this way.\r\nThere you have a few thoughts that I wanted to\r\nbring to your kind attention.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Festus\r\nG. Mogae, President of the Republic of Botswana.\r\nPresident Mogae: A great many global issues of\r\nfundamental importance that need to be mentioned\r\nhave been mentioned and fully articulated by others, by\r\ncolleagues whose oratorical brilliance and technical\r\ncompetence I cannot hope to equal, let alone surpass.\r\nConsequently, I will confine myself to addressing the\r\nscourge of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, including\r\nand especially southern Africa.\r\nI stand before the Assembly to claim the dubious\r\ndistinction of being leader of one of the countries that\r\nis most seriously affected by HIV/AIDS in the whole\r\nworld. The fight against HIV/AIDS is therefore for us\r\nthe challenge of the millennium.\r\nIn the last 25 years we achieved economic growth\r\nrates comparable to those of the Asian tigers, attained\r\nhuman development indices that were the envy of\r\nmany, practised multi-party democracy and\r\naccountable and transparent governance, maintained an\r\nopen society and ran an open economy.\r\nNow we daily witness elderly mothers mourning\r\nfor the untimely deaths of their beloved children,\r\nbabies born today only to be buried the next day and a\r\ngrowing population of orphans yearning for parental\r\nlove and care. These are the traumatizing realities of\r\nHIV/AIDS with which we live and with which we have\r\nto contend.\r\nHaving enjoyed peace and security and steady\r\neconomic growth, we suddenly find our gains in social\r\nadvancement reversed by this scourge. The\r\neconomically active population in our society, our most\r\nprecious resource, is being decimated. Our life\r\nexpectancy is calculated to have been reduced by 20\r\nyears, from 67 to 47.\r\nIt is frightening to note that half of the people\r\nwho become infected with HIV/AIDS are under the age\r\nof 25 years.\r\nOne of our major strategies to fight this rampant\r\nHIV/AIDS scourge has been to establish a\r\nmultisectoral National Council that I personally chair.\r\nAt the executive or technical level, we have established\r\nthe National AIDS Coordinating Agency, headed by a\r\nsenior official, to implement anti-HIV programmes.\r\nThe thrust of our strategy is information, education and\r\ncommunication, and we have combined this with\r\nconcerted efforts to destigmatize HIV/AIDS. We\r\ncontinue to hold consultative meetings with all key\r\nstakeholders. Our HIV/AIDS programmes include the\r\nprevention of mother-to-child transmission through the\r\nuse of anti-retroviral drugs. We have set up Voluntary\r\nTesting and Counselling Centres in our major\r\nsettlements, and more such facilities are being\r\nextended to other parts of the country. Community\r\nmobilization is being undertaken through house-to-\r\nhouse counselling. We have established alliances with\r\nBotswanas youth and other civil society organizations.\r\nOur Government is also implementing a\r\nprogramme of home-based care to ease congestion in\r\nthe hospitals and other health centres. More manpower\r\nand financial resources have been allocated, including\r\nthrough the diversion of development funds towards\r\nthe fight against HIV/AIDS. We are grateful to\r\nGovernments, the United Nations system, private\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations that\r\nhave established partnerships with us in the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS.\r\nSo far, the Government of Botswana funds 80 per\r\ncent of all HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities,\r\nand this may not be sustainable. Some of our children\r\nhave been infected at their very first experiment with\r\nsex. To spread our message as broadly as possible, we\r\nhave established multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS committees\r\nin every town and every village in our country. We are\r\ndetermined to eradicate the scourge, or at least, halt its\r\nspread.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a global problem\r\nwhich calls for global action. The pandemic threatens\r\nhuman development and social and economic security.\r\nThere is therefore an urgent need for concerted action\r\non the part of the international community as a whole\r\nto fight this scourge.\r\nFor mankind to prevail over this scourge, we need\r\ncommitment and unity of purpose. For those of us most\r\ndirectly affected, one more day of delayed action is a\r\nday too late for thousands of our people. Our people\r\nare crying out for help. Let us respond while there is\r\nstill time.\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General has called for\r\nthe reduction of HIV infection rates in persons 15 to\r\n24 years of age  by 25 per cent within the most\r\naffected countries before the year 2005 and by 25 per\r\ncent globally before 2010. (A/54/2000, para. 128). To\r\nachieve this target, we will need an infusion of tangible\r\nand adequate resources.\r\nAs developing countries, we cannot deal on our\r\nown with the whole spectrum of requisites for\r\neducation and sensitization, testing and counselling,\r\nadolescent reproductive health, prevention of mother-\r\nto-child transmissions, acquisition of drugs and\r\nmedication and care for the affected populations. We\r\ntherefore need to pool our efforts and resources and\r\nwork with the United Nations and the private sector to\r\nseek an effective remedy for this pandemic.\r\nI am confident that, as world leaders, if we act in\r\nunison in addressing this challenge that faces our\r\ncommon humanity, we will have good reason to\r\ncelebrate our contribution towards saving succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war  war in all its\r\nmanifestations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President of the Republic of\r\nTajikistan.\r\nPresident Rakhmonov (spoke in Russian): The\r\nhopes and aspirations of all the peoples of the world\r\nare focused on the work of our world forum. The\r\npeoples of the planet expect us to develop a strategy of\r\npartnership that will respond to their key interests and\r\nmeet their needs.\r\nWe are firmly convinced that our Summit\r\nprovides us with a wonderful opportunity to discuss\r\nissues of United Nations restructuring so as to address\r\ntwenty-first-century goals and to re-evaluate the global\r\nchallenges faced by humanity at its current stage of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTajikistan wholeheartedly supports the\r\nMillennium Assemblys determination to strengthen\r\nthe key role of the United Nations as a universal\r\nmechanism for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity and for developing multilateral cooperation\r\nbased on reaching a mutually acceptable balance of\r\ninterests for all nations.\r\nThe process of globalization that is so\r\ndramatically influencing the evolution of society\r\nshould be aimed at eliminating, rather than\r\nintensifying, the serious imbalances that divide the\r\nworld today. Therefore, in order to avoid social,\r\neconomic and political upheaval and shock and to\r\nensure economic security, we believe that these\r\nprocesses should be backed up by a considered and\r\npurposefully oriented social policy, especially in\r\ncountries with economies in transition.\r\nThe United Nations is called upon to encourage\r\nprocesses aimed at reducing the development gap\r\nbetween the rich and poor nations, in particular, by\r\nattracting investments to those countries with\r\neconomies in transition that do not possess oil and gas\r\nresources.\r\nTajikistan shares the view of many that forgiving\r\nthe accumulated debts of the countries that have gone\r\nthrough large-scale conflicts or natural disasters would\r\nprovide a powerful impetus to sustainable peace-\r\nbuilding in those countries. We are convinced that such\r\nmeasures would free up significant internal resources\r\nthat could be used for education and health care, for\r\nalleviating the consequences of conflicts and for\r\nresponding more effectively to natural disasters.\r\nTajikistan is striving to do whatever it can to\r\ncontribute to the resolution of pressing ecological\r\nissues. We call upon the Assembly to support the well-\r\nknown initiative of our country to proclaim the year\r\n2003 as the International Year of Freshwater. If, in\r\nthe coming century, through our consolidated efforts,\r\nwe are able to ensure access to freshwater for all the\r\npeople on our planet, we will save every second citizen\r\non the earth from infectious diseases. That is important\r\nnot only for Tajikistan, but for the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIf the Sarez Lake dam breaks, billions of cubic\r\nmetres of water will pour down the nearby valleys,\r\nflooding millions of hectares of land and making\r\napproximately 5 million citizens of Tajikistan,\r\nUzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan homeless.\r\nAn equally pressing global ecological problem is\r\nthe Aral Sea crisis, which is the result of the irrational\r\nusage of natural resources. These problems can be dealt\r\nwith only with the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe community of nations must take decisive\r\nsteps and coordinated action to fight international\r\nterrorism, the illegal drug trade and the uncontrolled\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\ntrade in weapons. Together with our partners in the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, Tajikistan is\r\nseriously concerned that we are being turned into a\r\nsource of constant threat to the security of other\r\ncountries, and not only those of Central Asia. We\r\nbelieve that the international community should take\r\nextraordinary and significant measures to curb\r\naggression, terrorism and other forms of extremism.\r\nIt is important that we increase our activities\r\naimed at achieving a peaceful settlement to the Afghan\r\nproblem. The lessons to be learned from what has\r\nhappened show us that only with the firm support of\r\nthe leading world Powers  first and foremost, Russia\r\nand the United States of America  and, of course,\r\nwith the goodwill of the parties to the conflict, will the\r\nUnited Nations be able to resolve the conflict in\r\nAfghanistan. In this connection, we consider the first\r\nmeeting of the Russian-American working group on\r\nAfghanistan, held in Washington in August 2000, to be\r\na promising start.\r\nWe believe that the peacekeeping activities of the\r\nOrganization should be based on full respect for the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of nations and that\r\nthey should be timely, equal to the situation as it\r\ndevelops and based on the coordinated collective\r\nactions of the international community. Only the\r\nSecurity Council has the exclusive right to sanction, on\r\nbehalf of the international community, the use of force\r\nfor the purpose of maintaining peace or restoring\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIt is our sacred duty to future generations not only\r\nto protect the United Nations, but, working together\r\nwith it, to make the world a better and more secure\r\nplace that is worthy of them so that they can live better\r\nand happier lives.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): Before giving\r\nthe floor to the next speaker, I would like to make an\r\nappeal. There are 21 speakers remaining on the list of\r\nspeakers for this meeting. Since we must exhaust the\r\nlist at each meeting, I appeal to the participants in the\r\nMillennium Summit to respect the five-minute time\r\nlimit for each speaker. That will allow us to hear all the\r\nspeakers on the list for this meeting.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency the Honourable Bernard Dowiyogo,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru.\r\nPresident Dowiyogo: The Republic of Nauru is\r\npleased to participate in this historic Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\nDespite having joined the United Nations only\r\nlast year, Nauru values very highly the work of this\r\nbody and also holds the highest expectations for its\r\nsuccess in the new century, since it was through the\r\nassistance of the United Nations some thirty-five years\r\nago that the people of Nauru secured the support of the\r\ninternational community for a vote on\r\nself-determination.\r\nHaving enjoyed thirty-five years of\r\nindependence, Nauru is greatly encouraged that,\r\nthrough the assistance of the United Nations, our East\r\nTimor brothers and sisters have secured a path towards\r\nindependence. On this occasion we join in prayer with\r\nthe families of the three United Nations personnel\r\nkilled yesterday on duty in East Timor and yet we can\r\nremain confident that the continued support of the\r\nUnited Nations will see the people of East Timor\r\nthrough to their final step of nationhood.\r\nOn the other hand, our Melanesian brothers and\r\nsisters in West Papua are still striving to break the\r\nimposition of colonial domination and foreign control\r\nfollowing the so-called act of free choice in 1969. It is\r\nimperative that West Papua be given the rightful\r\nopportunity of a democratic referendum by its\r\nindigenous peoples. The United Nations cannot stand\r\nby and witness the destruction of the people of West\r\nPapua, where already more than a half million people\r\nhave been lost as a result of human rights abuses. We\r\nmust not witness another catastrophe in this area as\r\noccurred in East Timor.\r\nNauru would therefore support a United Nations\r\nresolution that would permit the people of West Papua\r\nthe choice of self-determination.\r\nMy Government is concerned that the area\r\ncomprising the Pacific States does not receive\r\nsufficient attention from the United Nations. So often it\r\nbecomes lumped with Asia and is thereby\r\noverwhelmed by Asia. Oceania is a distinct area with\r\nunique characteristics and challenges. The Pacific\r\nshould be recognized by the United Nations on its own\r\nas a separate regional group.\r\nI am happy to charge the Assembly with the task\r\nof ensuring that, during this session of the Summit and\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nthe General Assembly, the Pacific region become a\r\nseparate national group.\r\nAs small island developing States we are\r\nespecially noted for our vulnerability, particularly in\r\nrespect of the fragility of our environment. Together\r\nwith our brothers and sisters of the Pacific, the people\r\nof Nauru are threatened with genocide through global\r\nwarming and the rise in sea-level. Nauru joins all\r\nresponsible nations of the world to urge, especially\r\nthose countries responsible for the present levels of\r\npollution, swift and early implementation of the goals\r\nenshrined in the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nIndeed, any cold wind is likely to inflict severe\r\ndamage, whether that cold wind arose from the rise in\r\nsea-levels, pollution of fishing grounds, financial\r\nsanctions or, as in Naurus case, the exhaustion of its\r\nonly export, phosphate. While tourist posters may\r\nconjure up images of paradise in the Pacific islands, the\r\ndevelopmental challenges are real and ominous. With\r\nhigh rates of population growth and vulnerable\r\neconomies there is increasing dependence on external\r\naid and there has been a steady decline in per capita\r\nincomes and standards of living resulting in increased\r\npoverty.\r\nWith substantial external debt, the developing\r\nStates of the Pacific not only require development\r\nassistance but considerable foreign private investment.\r\nEven as small island developing States have\r\nattempted to strengthen their slender resources, they\r\noccasionally come under attack from the developed\r\neconomies. The attacks recently from the Organisation\r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\r\non offshore financial regimes, including Nauru, have\r\nnot been based so much on money laundering, but\r\nrather on the more dubious reason of so-called harmful\r\ntax practices. Nauru has been appreciative of the\r\nsupport of the United Nations Offshore Forum which\r\nhas at least recognized the damage posed by the OECD\r\nattacks. If the small island developing States are to be\r\nsustainably developed they will need a massive\r\ncooperative effort from the developed States and a\r\ngenuine appreciation for their unique challenges.\r\nOne of the developed States which has extended a\r\nhand of cooperation has been the Republic of China.\r\nAs a robust democracy and champion of human rights\r\nvalues, the Republic of China has demonstrated both\r\ncapacity and enthusiasm to contribute meaningfully to\r\ninternational welfare and progress. Along with a\r\nnumber of other States Members of the United Nations,\r\nNauru therefore supports the inclusion of a\r\nsupplementary item on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly to examine the international situation of the\r\nRepublic of China.\r\nThe 23 million people of the Republic of China\r\ndeserve no less than proper international recognition,\r\nand as long as they are excluded from the United\r\nNations we cannot consider this body universally\r\nrepresentative of the peoples of the world.\r\nIn conclusion, I am hopeful that as the United\r\nNations strides into the new century, reform of the\r\nCharter will assume greater prominence. We certainly\r\ncannot accept that the United Nations continue as it\r\ndoes without allowing wider and deeper involvement\r\nof the international community in addressing core\r\nglobal challenges. As leaders, we have a duty to the\r\npeoples of the world to ensure that the new century is a\r\nsafer, more prosperous one than the twentieth century.\r\nIn this the two thousandth anniversary of the birth\r\nof our Christ, it is my sincere hope that love and\r\nunderstanding amongst the peoples of the world will\r\nprevail, for it has been said that the rule of law without\r\nlove is tyranny.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ferenc\r\nMádl, President of the Republic of Hungary.\r\nPresident Mádl: At the threshold of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, we live in a time of serious challenges\r\nand great opportunities. Today, there can be no doubt in\r\nour minds that a new phenomenon, globalization, is\r\nclearly on the march. It is in this context that the\r\nUnited Nations should spare no effort to unfold the\r\nhitherto hidden promises of globalization for the\r\nbenefit of all mankind.\r\nBy the same token, it is the common\r\nresponsibility of the Member States to play their part\r\neffectively to counter the disadvantages of this new\r\nphenomenon, especially for those of us who have so far\r\nbeen less fortunate. In this regard, the millennium\r\nreport of the Secretary-General deserves our full\r\nattention and deep appreciation. I am more than\r\nconfident that his major conclusions will find their way\r\nto help us fulfil the enormous tasks this Summit faces.\r\nIt is often, but rightly, said that global challenges\r\nrequire global responses. In our time, nations can and\r\nwill only be able to fight poverty, transnational\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\norganized crime, corruption, money-laundering,\r\ninternational terrorism and illicit drug-trafficking if\r\nthey act in concert. Hungary is ready and willing to\r\nplay its part to that end.\r\nOne of the major concerns of the international\r\ncommunity is the issue of the protection of the\r\nenvironment. I believe that the time has come for us all\r\nto rededicate ourselves to address environmental\r\nissues, including the degradation of the environment,\r\nand, at the same time, to exert redoubled efforts to\r\npreserve the blessings of nature on our planet for\r\ngenerations to come. The principle of polluter-pays\r\nshould find its proper place in all relevant international\r\ndocuments. In this regard, Hungary is more than\r\nprepared to act regionally, as well as globally, to that\r\nend.\r\nFor us Hungarians, a nation proud of its history,\r\nvalues represent the basis of policies. The Republic of\r\nHungary also pursues a foreign policy based on values.\r\nConsequently, universal values such as respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms  including\r\nminority rights  democracy, the rule of law and\r\nsocial justice remain close to our hearts and minds. In\r\nthis respect, I wish to recall that the United Nations has\r\nplayed a more than commendable role in the\r\ninternational protection of human rights. The Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and various relevant\r\nconventions helped the dignity and fundamental\r\nfreedoms of the individual to flourish.\r\nHowever, as far as human rights are concerned, I\r\nbelieve there is a historical obligation on the part of the\r\nUnited Nations. I hope and pray that international\r\nprotection for the rights of minorities, including the\r\nrelevant responsibilities as well as the accountability of\r\nthe States concerned, will also be drawn up in a legally\r\nbinding comprehensive instrument. The sooner the\r\ninternational community acts, the better service we\r\nrender to freedom, democracy and the protection of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThis Summit is a precious and timely opportunity\r\nto give new impetus to the reform of the United\r\nNations. Our rapidly changing world needs a renewed\r\nUnited Nations. To better reflect the new political and\r\neconomic realities, it is also indispensable that the\r\nSecurity Council be enlarged, with new permanent\r\nmembers, to include Germany and Japan among others.\r\nThe anniversary of Hungarys 1,000 years of\r\nStatehood coincides with the new millennium. I bring\r\nthe message of celebration of our people to this forum.\r\nThe values Hungary represents and the objectives we\r\npursue will also make it possible for us to take part in\r\nthe renewal of the commitment to the noble purposes\r\nand principles the United Nations is called to act upon\r\nin the twenty-first century. It is in this spirit that my\r\ncountry stands ready to contribute our share to work\r\nfor a safer and more secure world with the help of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Milan\r\nKučan, President of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nPresident Kučan (spoke in Slovene; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): This historic session is an\r\nopportunity to reaffirm the positive role of the United\r\nNations and to stress the demand for the respect of\r\nhuman dignity and human individual and collective\r\nrights as the fundamental and universal principle of its\r\nfuture actions. In todays world, peace and security, the\r\ntwo basic objectives of the Untied Nations, depend\r\nmainly on consistent respect of this principle. This is\r\nthe key challenge of our future.\r\nExperience tells us that recognizing, promoting\r\nand protecting human rights is equally important for\r\npeace and security, as are recognizing and protecting\r\nthe sovereignty of States. As a rule, armed conflicts\r\ntoday are taking place within the borders of sovereign\r\nStates, and not between them. These internal wars\r\nengender violence, genocide and ethnic cleansing,\r\nwhere peoples fates depend on their belonging to a\r\nparticular race, nationality or religion. Regional\r\nsecurity and global peace are becoming increasingly\r\ndependent on the United Nations capacity to intervene\r\nefficiently when States are perpetrating violence\r\nagainst their own citizens.\r\nThe international community has already\r\nintervened in such conflicts. In most cases, the\r\nintervention came too late, the means were inadequate\r\nand the results were insufficient. Although these are\r\nrecognized facts, we still lack systemic and agreed\r\nsolutions that would ensure timely and efficient results.\r\nIt is also for these reasons that the reform of the United\r\nNations is imperative. In this context, I would place the\r\nprinciple of State sovereignty, which also includes a\r\nStates own responsibility for its citizens and for other\r\nStates. That principle cannot be an excuse for\r\nsystematic violence and mass violations of human\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nrights. It also cannot be the value that would prevent\r\nUnited Nations intervention in such cases.\r\nWe were all aware of, and are mutually\r\nresponsible for, the tragedies that occurred in Rwanda,\r\nCambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo,\r\nSrebrenica and Vukovar. Today, those types of\r\ntragedies continue to occur in the world. We are also\r\nresponsible for preventing them from happening again.\r\nClear signs in south-eastern Europe in particular warn\r\nthat the tragedy could happen again.\r\nI am therefore confident that we shall find the\r\nnecessary political will to modernize and equip the\r\nUnited Nations for this task. I wish to believe that\r\nthose who have been entrusted with a seat in the\r\nSecurity Council by virtue of the United Nations\r\nCharter  and thus with a special responsibility to\r\nsafeguard world peace and security  will gather the\r\nnecessary commitment, spirit and courage to take\r\ntimely decisions.\r\nThe Security Council must act in line with its\r\nprimary responsibility to preserve peace and security in\r\nthe world. It must recognize circumstances that demand\r\nUnited Nations authorized action, including the use of\r\nforce. It must respect the principle of protecting State\r\nsovereignty, but not by remaining paralysed when\r\nfaced with crimes against humanity. The international\r\ncommunity, led by the United Nations, has the\r\nobligation to act to protect threatened and innocent\r\ncivilian populations against genocide, ethnic cleansing\r\nand systematic mass violence perpetrated by the\r\nauthorities in their own State. Those who enjoy the\r\nright of veto, which represents a special responsibility\r\nborne by permanent members of the Security Council,\r\nmust not hide behind arguments that national internal\r\naffairs are at stake and thereby paralyse the Councils\r\nwork and responsibility.\r\nI support the appeal of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan regarding humanitarian intervention, quoted in\r\nhis report We the peoples. I expect that, together, we\r\nshall strive to make it possible for the international\r\ncommunity to be capable of reacting and ensuring that,\r\nwhen the principle of state sovereignty is abused, it\r\ndoes not remain helpless in the face of violence and\r\ngross violations of fundamental human rights.\r\nHumanitarian intervention is an active response\r\nto a humanitarian crisis and a prolongation of\r\npreventive diplomacy, which attempts to solve disputes\r\nbefore they degenerate into conflicts. It requires a new\r\nchapter in international law which would be adapted to\r\ncontemporary understanding of international morality.\r\nInternational humanitarian law is an impressive idea\r\nand a requirement of our times. For the time being, its\r\nnorms are vague, often unknown and frequently\r\ndeliberately violated. For this reason, it is imperative to\r\nelaborate a doctrine for humanitarian intervention\r\nbased on a modern interpretation of the United Nations\r\nCharter and in line with new international relations and\r\nnorms, which in certain conditions give priority to the\r\nprotection of human rights. My conviction in this\r\nrespect is reinforced by my human and political\r\nexperience of the Balkan tragedy and of Slovenia\u0027s\r\nparticipation in peacekeeping missions.\r\nDespite positive achievements, we remain, at the\r\nturn of the millennium, still far from achieving our\r\ngoals in terms of global security and peace, poverty\r\neradication, reducing the enormous disparities in\r\nwelfare, development and ensuring social and legal\r\nsecurity of people. We are far from achieving equality\r\namong the different civilizations we belong to and\r\nwhich enrich the material and spiritual lives of\r\nhumankind. The opportunity has now also come to\r\nrecognize the universal significance of human rights\r\nfor global security and peace in the globalized world,\r\nwith multiple centres of development of human\r\ncivilization, and to prevent erstwhile confrontations\r\nbetween military and political blocs from being\r\nreplaced by confrontations between civilizations,\r\ncultures and religions, which would have fatal\r\nconsequences for the future of humankind.\r\nIn the future, too, the role of the United Nations\r\nwill remain irreplaceable. However, its authority and\r\nreputation will not be ensured by our words. Peoples\r\nfaith in the United Nations will be strengthened by its\r\neffectiveness and capacity to implement declared\r\nprinciples, and by its guarantee of peace, security,\r\nhuman dignity and human rights.\r\nSlovenia supports the noble principles and\r\nobjectives for which we have gathered here. Now,\r\ncourageous steps are needed. I am confident that, in the\r\nspirit of the United Nations, we are capable of making\r\nthem.\r\nFinally, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that\r\nSlovenia will increase its financial contribution to\r\nUnited Nations peace operations in the coming year.\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Paul\r\nBiya, President of the Republic of Cameroon.\r\nPresident Biya (spoke in French): Cameroon,\r\nformerly under United Nations trusteeship, has\r\nremained deeply committed to this Organization and to\r\nthe principles on which it is founded. I am thus\r\nextremely pleased to participate in this Millennium\r\nSummit, which will be set down in letters of gold in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to congratulate the Co-\r\nChairpersons on their elections. We see in this\r\npresidency of North and South a harbinger of new\r\ntimes, a sign of the determination of the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations to approach the twenty-first century\r\ntogether and to build the future together in a spirit of a\r\ncontract of solidarity.\r\nI am also pleased to commend the action of our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whom the people\r\nof Cameroon and I had the pleasure of welcoming last\r\nMay. I congratulate him once again for his enlightening\r\nreport and the concrete proposals formulated with the\r\ncurrent Summit in mind.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nfive years ago gave us an early opportunity to engage\r\nin collective introspection and in lively consideration\r\nof the role and future mission of the United Nations.\r\nThe final Declaration adopted at that time affirmed the\r\nintangibility of the ideals, principles and objectives set\r\nout in the Charter and points out the road to follow for\r\nthe Member States.\r\nBy amplifying and extending that Declaration,\r\nthis Summit, at the threshold between two centuries\r\nand two millenniums, invites us to reiterate our active\r\nfaith in the ideals and objectives of the United Nations\r\nby consolidating what should endure and by reforming\r\nwhat needs to be reformed.\r\nHaving remained faithful to its ideals and\r\nobjectives, the United Nations can take pride today in\r\nits striking achievements in the promotion of peace,\r\nsecurity, respect for human rights, democracy and\r\ninternational economic cooperation. However, many\r\nscourges remain: wars and conflicts, massive violations\r\nof human rights and the ever widening gap between\r\nNorth and South. New scourges have emerged, such as\r\nAIDS, whose seroprevalence in many countries and\r\nregions would seem to augur very difficult times to\r\ncome.\r\nThe United Nations, which is facing all these\r\nchallenges, needs the support of our political will to\r\nmeet as best it can the legitimate aspirations of the\r\npeoples of the United Nations to an equitable share of\r\nthe fruits of globalization, the advent of a world free\r\nfrom war and poverty, and respect  everywhere and\r\nfor everyone  for all human rights. These are and\r\nremain the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt is up to us today to give this Organization the\r\nmeans to make these aspirations a reality. This will\r\nnecessarily require a just and equitable solution to the\r\ndebt problem; the strengthening of financial capacities\r\nand hence the action of our Organization to ensure\r\nenhanced support for subregional organizations; and\r\nthe priority quest for the prevention of armed conflicts.\r\nIn todays world, which tends to relegate human\r\nbeings to the background, our Organization, if it is to\r\ncarry out its mission efficiently, must meet the\r\nchallenge of ethical values. If globalization is not\r\naccompanied by a new moral order, if it lacks that extra\r\nspirit that constitutes solidarity among nations and\r\npeoples, it runs the risk of jeopardizing peace, which is\r\nso cherished by our times.\r\nIn truth, our world needs ethics. As a set of moral\r\nvalues, ethics constitute an essential expectation on the\r\npart of the entire human community. Thanks to ethics,\r\nthe centrality of human beings in our policies and\r\nactions will be enshrined. Indeed, how can we speak of\r\nhuman rights without speaking of the right to\r\ndevelopment? What do democracy and good\r\ngovernance mean without the ethics of management for\r\nthe common good? Are not ethics of international\r\nsolidarity necessary in dealing with the debts of poor\r\ncountries?\r\nWe call for the establishment within the United\r\nNations Secretariat of a committee or of an\r\ninternational ethics monitor, entrusted precisely with\r\nthe task of promoting fundamental and universal\r\nhuman values between and within nations.\r\nThis Summit provides us an opportunity for\r\nthoughtful and fruitful reflection about our future. Let\r\nus conduct it with optimism, assuming our\r\nresponsibilities with respect to future generations. This\r\noptimism must be based on the rock-hard foundations\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nof solidarity. On the eve of the twenty-first century, it\r\nis up to us to courageously undertake the building of a\r\nfuture free from war and poverty.\r\nFor its part, Cameroon will be an active partner in\r\nall efforts to guarantee for future generations the\r\nbenefits of all the values and ideals of the United\r\nNations for a prosperous international community, one\r\nwith justice, solidarity, harmony and peace.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Kenny Anthony, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance, Economic Affairs and\r\nInformation of Saint Lucia.\r\nMr. Anthony (Saint Lucia): We are gathered here\r\ntoday to reaffirm our faith in this Organization, this\r\nUnited Nations. We are gathered here to reconfirm that\r\nthe purposes and principles of its Charter can safely\r\nlead us in the new millennium and fulfil the ageless\r\nexpectation of a world free of poverty, free of hunger,\r\nfree of war, free of the dictatorship of the mighty and\r\nfree for us to enjoy our right to development.\r\nBut why should Saint Lucia, an island of 238\r\nsquare miles, with a population of 155,000 persons, be\r\ninterested in the will and conscience of the United\r\nNations? Has this body demonstrated in any way that it\r\nis a sanctuary for small island developing States? Was\r\nit not a promise from the time of its birth to protect the\r\nweak, vulnerable and marginalized? Was this not the\r\nhope?\r\nSo I ask, where is the hope when the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) has orchestrated the destruction\r\nof the economies of some small Caribbean countries,\r\nthrough a ruling that condemns the preferential\r\nmarketing arrangements for their bananas in Europe as\r\nbeing anti-free trade? How can this be just when these\r\narrangements are a life force of the economies of these\r\ncountries? How can this be defensible when the\r\nCaribbean banana trade represents only 2 per cent of\r\nthe world banana trade? Where are equity, justice and\r\nfairness when other developing countries participate in\r\nthis attack on our livelihood? Where is the promise\r\nwhen the member countries of the Organisation for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development arrogate to\r\nthemselves the right to make pronouncements on the\r\nefficacy of the international financial services\r\nindustries of a number of Caribbean countries, when\r\nthey imperiously seek to determine the nature of our\r\ntax regimes by blacklisting those countries as harmful\r\ntax havens? Harmful to whom?\r\nIn this new age, we are exhorted to be\r\ncompetitive. Yet, whenever we manage to succeed in\r\nthis endeavour, our developed world shouts Foul!\r\nand accuses us of being harmful and discriminatory.\r\nTherefore, I say that those prophets of the new age of\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization who trumpet hope\r\nin their praises of that new age do so only because they\r\nare the ones who enjoy its benefits. But for us in small\r\nisland States like Saint Lucia, what we hear is the\r\ndeafening silence of a new order that ignores our\r\nspecial needs. What we experience is the insensitivity\r\nand the lack of interest of the mighty as they\r\nmanipulate the system for their selfish ends. How can\r\nwe laud the new order? How can we sing its praises?\r\nWe are gathered here at a time of supreme\r\nparadox in the history of mankind. We meet at a time\r\nwhen the peoples of the world can celebrate the\r\nunparalleled progress that humankind has made in the\r\nlast century. Yet we are gathering at a time when they\r\ncan also reflect on the unprecedented horrors and\r\ncontradictions that human civilization has visited upon\r\nitself during this epoch. On the one hand, we have a\r\nworld of unlimited possibility, a world of technological\r\nwizardry  all inflated to millennial proportions. On\r\nthe other hand, there is a digital divide that more than\r\never extends the gap between the haves and the have-\r\nnots into those who know from those who do not.\r\nToday, life expectancy has increased.\r\nEducational, nutritional and health standards have\r\nimproved qualitatively and quantitatively; but we have\r\nnever, ever, before been stricken by diseases of the\r\nsame nature and on the same scale as those that\r\npresently afflict us.\r\nThe worlds economy has generated more wealth\r\nthan at any other time in history, and the prospects for\r\neconomic prosperity are a lot brighter for a larger\r\npercentage of the worlds population than ever before.\r\nBut how can we explain the fact that, according to the\r\nconference report on eradicating global poverty,\r\nParliamentary Action Agenda for the Twenty-first\r\nCentury, 3 billion people on the planet are living on\r\nless than $1 a day and 1 billion subsist on less than $3\r\ndollars a day? Today, the combined wealth of the three\r\nrichest people in the world is greater than the combined\r\ngross domestic product of the 48 poorest countries in\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nthe world. Of the 100 largest economies in the world,\r\n51 are corporations, not countries.\r\nHow can we explain the fact that international\r\nassistance from wealthy countries to poorer countries\r\nhas reached its lowest point in 20 years? Where is the\r\ncollective conscience of humankind? Where is our\r\nsense of justice? Where is the brotherhood that binds\r\nus together? Where is the hope?\r\nToday, there is an evil stalking our civilization. It\r\nis the trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs.\r\nEvery day one of our young citizens succumbs to these\r\ndrugs, and I know that we may have lost another\r\ngenius. Day after day, we persist in pursuing strategies\r\nthat are clearly not working. We must urgently review\r\nthose strategies. We must consider and commit\r\nourselves to new approaches to eradicating the scourge\r\nof drug trafficking and addiction, otherwise we will\r\nlose not only our young people but also our\r\ncommunities, and in time, our Governments.\r\nIf the United Nations truly wishes to embrace\r\nsmall States and the developing world and live up to\r\nthe promise of its birth, it must redefine global\r\ngovernance so as to embody the key principles of\r\ninclusiveness, equality, transparency and participatory\r\naction. Due deference and recognition must be paid to\r\nthe special conditions of small developing countries.\r\nWe must accept the constraints imposed upon them by\r\ngeography and population size. We must understand\r\ntheir limited internal markets and resource endowment.\r\nWe must appreciate their low levels of economic\r\ndiversification. We must realize their high\r\nsusceptibility to external shocks. We must sympathize\r\nwith their vulnerability to natural disasters and the\r\neffects of environmental change. The United Nations\r\nsystem must take the leading role in the refashioning of\r\nmultilateral economic governance so as to establish a\r\nnew regime that is fully legitimate and effective, so\r\nthat States like Saint Lucia, given their openness, small\r\nsize, diseconomies of scale and vulnerability, are not\r\nfurther victimized, marginalized and ostracized.\r\nThe new millennium presents for us a special\r\nhistorical opportunity, a chance for new beginnings, a\r\nwindow through which desired moral imperatives can\r\ninfuse the international system with new guiding\r\nprinciples for a different, fairer world order. In the\r\nexisting plethora of international organizations, the\r\nUnited Nations system must lie at the legislative and\r\nnormative centre of the world order. The United\r\nNations system is the only universal forum capable of\r\ninstitutionalizing development cooperation. Yet rich\r\nand powerful members of this body seek to denature it\r\nand strip it of its developmental role and focus. In the\r\ncontext of the global order, the United Nations must\r\nbecome the eternal symbol of the world community for\r\nequality in rights and unity of action  an institution\r\nwhere weakness can be ameliorated by justice and\r\nfairness. We cannot build a civilization without a\r\nconscience.\r\nIf there is to be hope that the United Nations can\r\nfashion a twenty-first century free of want and free of\r\nfear, then we must accept that the pursuit of genuine\r\nglobal peace and security cannot be attained merely\r\nthrough peacekeeping, but rather by addressing the root\r\ncauses of conflict, poverty, deprivation and\r\ndiscrimination among the worlds peoples and nations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Goh\r\nChok Tong, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nSingapore.\r\nMr. Goh (Singapore): Our world is becoming\r\nmore globalized, yet at the same time more fragmented.\r\nTechnological advances have brought the world closer,\r\nbut they have also opened up divides between those\r\nwho are able to cope with the resultant challenges and\r\nthose who lack the capacity to do so.\r\nWe need to update and strengthen the United\r\nNations to deal with these new problems, as well as the\r\nstubborn old ones. We need to do so because no nation\r\ncan tackle these challenges alone.\r\nI wish to highlight three areas of concern in this\r\nregard.\r\nFirst, the nation-State is being redefined. The\r\npower within States is flowing downwards and being\r\nlocalized in provinces and cities. At the same time,\r\nState sovereignty is being circumscribed by regional\r\nand multilateral organizations. Furthermore, new\r\nactors  for example, global corporations, some of\r\nwhich have larger outputs than the gross domestic\r\nproduct of some Member States  and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, some of which have more\r\ninternational clout than some Governments  are now\r\na prominent and integral part of international life. How\r\ndo we engage these new power players in a\r\nconstructive way in the United Nations? What balance\r\ncan we find between the national role of sovereign\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nStates and the international mandate of multilateral\r\norganizations?\r\nSecondly, there has been a growing empowerment\r\nof the market in recent years. The financial industry\r\nholds more assets than the central banks of the world\r\ncombined. The value of our national currencies is\r\ndetermined every day by the market rather than by our\r\ncentral banks. Three years ago, dramatic flows of\r\nvolatile short-term capital destabilized economies and\r\nwiped out years of hard work in several Asian\r\ncountries.\r\nHowever, opting out of the global market is not a\r\nsolution. So how can the United Nations help\r\ndeveloping countries build the capabilities that will\r\nenable them to become part of the new world? How\r\ncan we help small economies maintain control of their\r\ndestiny as they liberalize and open up?\r\nThirdly, globalization and the knowledge\r\nrevolution will widen the income gap between\r\ncountries, and hence create new tensions. Our world\r\nrisks being sharply divided between countries which\r\nare able to take advantage of globalization and others\r\nwhich cannot; between countries with high education\r\nlevels and those which have low literacy rates; and\r\nbetween those which are Internet-savvy and those\r\nwhich do not have access to even the basic computer.\r\nWhat can the United Nations do to help minimize\r\nthese new inequalities? I offer one simple idea for a\r\nstart. The United Nations should provide the leadership\r\nwithin the community of multilateral organizations to\r\nhelp the poorer nations develop the capacity to profit\r\nfrom globalization and the knowledge revolution. The\r\nUnited Nations, the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF), the World Bank and several other international\r\norganizations were created in a different era to deal\r\nwith different challenges. They need to be updated.\r\nFurthermore, these institutions work separately, and not\r\nas a team. Today, however, there is an imperative for\r\nthem to coordinate their efforts. They need to get\r\ntogether to assess what competencies the poorer\r\nnations need to develop in this new era. They should\r\nthen put in place coordinated programmes to build\r\ncapacity for globalization and the knowledge\r\nrevolution. I call upon the Secretary-General to\r\ninstitute regular dialogues among the multilateral\r\norganizations to bring about such coordination.\r\nThat said, however effective we make the United\r\nNations, it cannot by itself solve the problems of the\r\nworld. The onus is also on us, acting collectively\r\nwithin our regional groupings, to help increase our own\r\ncapabilities. Individual countries must also have the\r\nnational leadership and institutions to achieve stability,\r\ngrowth and equity for their people.\r\nIn short, national unity of purpose, cohesive\r\nregions, and a multilateral framework under the\r\nleadership of a rejuvenated United Nations  these are\r\nwhat will give us hope and confidence for the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Kenny Anthony, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance, Development, Planning and\r\nNational Security of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Anthony (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I begin my\r\nstatement by saluting the architects of this Millennium\r\nSummit. The Summit is opportune and offers us, as\r\nleaders, a chance to build on the progress we have\r\nmade, while we reflect, in an open and honest way, on\r\nthe way forward and on the future of the United\r\nNations. The Summit comes at a time of heightened\r\nexpectations within our own respective countries. This\r\nimplies that we must engage in a sober and honest\r\nexamination of problems that confront our peoples and\r\nthose confronting the Organization. We must therefore\r\nuse this occasion to re-energize and refocus our foreign\r\npolicies and national programmes to fit the new global\r\nframework and to benefit all the peoples of the world.\r\nI say it categorically: this is not a matter I take\r\nlightly. It is a monumental task, one that requires\r\nboldness and a commitment of vision to fashion a\r\ntomorrow that will not only reflect the dawn of a new\r\nday but also the realization of peoples legitimate\r\nhopes and expectations. That is the mandate of my\r\nGovernment, and my Administration is committed to it.\r\nIn the challenge to raise the standard of living for our\r\npeople we cannot and must not now relent. The cause\r\nof people and the preservation of peace and human\r\nsecurity is a work in progress.\r\nIt is within that context that my country credits\r\nthe United Nations as having tremendous relevance in\r\nour lives. To us, the Millennium Summit is a call for\r\ncollective action: collective action to create a more\r\neffective United Nations. I have witnessed some\r\nsuccesses in the United Nations, but I have also seen\r\nthe Organization frustrated. Although the General\r\nAssembly remains democratic, my Government is still\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nconcerned that while Member States extol the virtues\r\nof good governance and democracy within States, they\r\nseek at the international level to preserve a system\r\nwithin the Security Council that is undemocratic and\r\ninimical to true democracy within the institution.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council has defied\r\nresolution for too long. Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nencourages democracy within and among States. We\r\ncelebrated that tradition recently when we welcomed\r\nnew Member States into our fraternity of nations. In\r\nthis same spirit, I trust that the United Nations will\r\nhelp to secure the requisite understanding that will\r\nsoon enable the millions of people on Taiwan to benefit\r\nfrom this international spring of brotherhood and\r\ninclusion.\r\nAs the Caribbean Communitys current\r\nrepresentative and spokesman on health-related issues,\r\nI am constantly reminded of the real and devastating\r\npandemic of HIV/AIDS. This disease does not\r\nrecognize national boundaries, and it threatens to\r\nundermine future economic and social development\r\nand to turn back the clock on progress in many of our\r\nnations. I therefore urge the United Nations to continue\r\nits important work through the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). We also look\r\nforward to a special session on HIV/AIDS to intensify\r\nand further coordinate our approaches at the\r\ninternational level. We have to continue the work to\r\nmodify behaviours and embrace new attitudes in\r\ndealing with the pandemic, which threatens to\r\nundermine the economies and social fabric of many\r\nnations in Latin America and the Caribbean, the region\r\nnow said to have the second highest number of cases of\r\ninfection, after sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nFurther, my Government envisages a United\r\nNations better equipped to preserve the progress that\r\nwe have made in the areas of human security, peace,\r\npoverty alleviation, sustainable development and\r\ndemocracy, and to build on them. I invite the United\r\nNations to be more involved in the debate on\r\ntechnology transfer, lending expertise in this endeavour\r\nby becoming a more meaningful partner. It should help\r\nto identify not only areas for technology transfer, but\r\nmore important, the transfer of relevant and appropriate\r\ntechnology.\r\nTime and time again, our small island States have\r\nswallowed the bitter medicine prescribed to us in order\r\nto participate fully in this global economy. But\r\nwhenever we appear to reach a milestone, the post is\r\narbitrarily moved. We urge the United Nations to\r\nbecome the genuine partner of small island developing\r\nStates, the genuine partner that we envisaged. We\r\nfurther encourage the realization that a vulnerability\r\nindex must be factored into any assessment of the\r\nneeds of small island States. This vulnerability index\r\nmust also be considered in planning programmes of\r\nassistance by the multilateral development, financial\r\nand State institutions.\r\nWe commend the areas of the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport that speak to human security, and we expect the\r\nUnited Nations to continue to play a proactive role in\r\nthis endeavour. We urge the United Nations, through\r\nthe Secretary-General, to impress upon the countries of\r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment that unilateral blacklisting of countries\r\nis counter-productive, and that any debate affecting the\r\ninterests of small developing countries must be raised\r\nto the level of multilateral forums where all our voices\r\ncan be heard. Also, the United Nations has to play a\r\ngreater role in forging better understanding on trade-\r\nrelated issues.\r\nMy people, in voting my Administration into\r\noffice, placed their hopes, their faith and their future in\r\nour hands. I continue to place their hopes in this\r\nOrganization. We can ill-afford disappointment. The\r\nGovernment and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nremain committed to the United Nations, and we pray\r\nfor its continued viability. We truly hope that it will\r\nbecome the mechanism that best translates our dreams\r\ninto realities. But as we look to the horizon of its\r\nfuture, I truly hope we understand that any future\r\nprosperity of our world requires a united international\r\napproach.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): I thank the\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance, Development,\r\nPlanning and National Security of Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis for his statement.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Giuliano Amato, Prime Minister of the\r\nItalian Republic.\r\nMr. Amato (Italy): Delegates will have noticed\r\nthat almost all of us are beginning our interventions by\r\nsaying something like, We are gathered today to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the centrality of the United\r\nNations. Now I think that this is not just rhetoric; it is\r\nthe right response to an essential need of the world in\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nthe new century, which demands that the United\r\nNations tackle the main challenge as well as the main\r\nthreat of our future. This challenge and threat is the\r\nsharp division between those whose essential rights to\r\nsecurity, to life, to dignity, to development, to health\r\nand to education are safeguarded and those  the\r\nmany, the most  who are still excluded from all this.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations will depend\r\non its ability to overcome this divide. There are no\r\nprospects for anyone in the next century if we fail to\r\nprovide fair prospects for everyone.\r\nAs the Prime Minister of a country that has\r\nheavily invested its energies and resources in the\r\nUnited Nations system, as the head of the Government\r\nof a major member of the European Union and of the\r\ncountry that will be chairing the G-8 next year, I must\r\nstress that Italy stands ready to fulfil its\r\nresponsibilities. I will mention two examples: the\r\nItalian engagement in United Nations peace\r\noperations  we are now the third highest provider of\r\nmilitary manpower for such operations  and our\r\nrecent law on the cancellation of the foreign debt of the\r\npoorest countries, a law that goes beyond our\r\nmultilateral engagements and de facto will increase\r\nsubstantially our financial allocations for development\r\naid.\r\nPrecisely because my country has taken concrete\r\nsteps, and is about to take others, I feel entitled to\r\nstress that we need bold and speedy decisions in\r\nrelation to several priorities for action. To make\r\nsubstantive progress in poverty reduction is the first\r\nand main priority. The others are to improve the United\r\nNations capability to handle crises, to make the\r\ndefence of universal human rights effective and to\r\nmobilize the international community against\r\norganized international crime.\r\nI will not have the time here to go through all of\r\nthese priorities. Let me say a few words on some of\r\nthem.\r\nFirst of all, regarding progress in poverty\r\nreduction: the goal we have set for ourselves, halving\r\npoverty by 2015, requires radical efforts. These efforts\r\nare especially needed for Africa  a whole continent\r\nin danger of falling into a vicious circle of poverty and\r\nconflict, which we have to break. But the same could\r\nalso be said of small insular States and landlocked\r\ncountries. As we all know, debt cancellation is\r\nimportant, but it is not enough. The industrialized\r\nworld and the relevant countries need a common\r\nstrategy. We have to pre-empt any of the current\r\nemerging temptations for unilateral interventions that\r\ncut off the relevant Governments. There is no action\r\nwithout the Governments of the countries involved. We\r\nneed a common strategy for this.\r\nThe less-advanced countries can and should\r\ndevelop political and economic reforms  actual steps\r\nand uses of the few resources they have for poverty-\r\nreduction programmes. The more advanced countries\r\ncan and should develop a better mix of policies,\r\nblending measures directed at debt reduction. We also\r\nhave to address the problems of middle-income\r\nnations, because poverty is an increasing issue in\r\nmiddle-income nations as well. And we also need to\r\naddress the issues of open markets and fresh\r\ninvestment in key sectors, beginning with education\r\nand health.\r\nI must insist on two points that Italy will put at\r\nthe forefront of its positions at the forthcoming Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries and at the meeting on financing for\r\ndevelopment, and which I will propose again at the\r\nGenoa Summit of the G-8 next year: The importance of\r\nopening our markets by abolishing quotas and tariffs\r\nfor the least developed countries  any effort is\r\npointless if we keep quotas and tariffs vis-à-vis these\r\ncountries, of allocating fresh resources to education,\r\nand of extending access to the new information\r\ntechnologies and to the fight against disease. My\r\ncountry intends to contribute directly to the Health\r\nInterNetwork suggested by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport to the Assembly.\r\nI do not have time to go into United Nations\r\ncapabilities to handle crises. I limit myself to saying\r\nthat on this point I agree with the essence of the\r\nconclusion of the Brahimi report, and that Italy intends,\r\namong other initiatives, to participate in the training of\r\nthe civilian and police personnel for United Nations\r\nmissions.\r\nFinally, let me say that responsibility and priority\r\nare the key words. They require the existence of\r\nmultilateral institutions that are strong and perceived as\r\nlegitimate. This is a crucial issue: legitimacy of the\r\ndecisions that are taken by groups, institutions and any\r\nother body on the international scene. Legitimacy\r\nmeans the democratization of decision-making\r\nprocesses in todays world. Even sound policies, even\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nsound measures can be rejected if the countries called\r\nupon to implement them perceive such implementation\r\nas an imposition upon them. That is why it is so\r\ndifficult to find and to pursue common strategies\r\naround the world.\r\nThis is the crucial issue we have to tackle in the\r\nfuture and that we have to tackle when revising the\r\nfunctioning and the structure of the different bodies of\r\nthe United Nations to improve their efficiency, their\r\ndemocratic legitimacy and power of decision. These\r\nare also the criteria that must inspire a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nI am not sure that the words we are pronouncing\r\ntoday, as most of us are so encouragingly meeting, will\r\nremain after this Millennium Summit. I hope that our\r\ncommitments will remain and will inspire our future\r\nactions. I rely on the Secretary-Generals promise to\r\ntransform our commitments today and of these past few\r\ndays into a common programme of action. This is what\r\nwe all have to implement in this regard.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Basdeo Panday, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nTrinidad and Tobago.\r\nMr. Panday (Trinidad and Tobago): That we are\r\nmeeting at this level, in these unprecedented numbers,\r\nis an unmistakable manifestation of our belief in the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to be the effective\r\ncatalyst for peace and progress, for freedom and\r\njustice, for inclusiveness and dignity for and among\r\nnations and for all peoples of the world.\r\nThe interests of the people of the world whom we\r\nare assembled here to represent will undoubtedly be\r\nadvanced by the fuller understanding and the deeper\r\nempathy with the needs and concerns of member\r\nnations  large and small, rich and poor  that this\r\nMillennium Summit will engender. For this alone, this\r\nSummit is of significant value to the world.\r\nWe all face common challenges and common\r\nthreats: joblessness and poverty, the globalization of\r\nnarco-trafficking, the global HIV/AIDS pandemic, the\r\ncontinuing development and retention of nuclear\r\nweaponry, the proliferation of small arms, the\r\ndegradation of the environment and, to mankind\u0027s\r\neternal shame, racism, racial intolerance and religious\r\nintolerance.\r\nI make bold to say that my own country, the\r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago, has responded to a\r\nnumber of these challenges with a vigour and\r\neffectiveness quite disproportionate to our small size\r\nand our small population of 1.3 million people. We\r\nhave, for example, introduced  and we are\r\nimplementing  a regime of anti-money laundering\r\nmeasures that are close to the toughest and most\r\ncomprehensive to be found in any jurisdiction of the\r\nworld. This includes provision for seizure of ill-gotten\r\nwealth and assets which cannot be rationally explained.\r\nIn taking the fight to the narco-traffickers, we\r\nhave forged strong and productive alliances with the\r\nUnited States of America, with Caribbean nations and\r\nwith other countries.\r\nWe have confronted poverty with such\r\npurposefulness that the current United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programmes Human Development\r\nReport ranks Trinidad and Tobago one of the five\r\ncountries that have been most successful in overcoming\r\nsevere poverty among all developing nations of the\r\nworld.\r\nBy another measure Trinidad and Tobago has\r\nbeen notably successful in managing diversity through\r\nthe strong commitment and adherence to the principle\r\nand practice of true inclusion in all areas of public life\r\nin our country. Indeed, out of our great diversity have\r\ncome the essential spirit of our people, our celebration\r\nof life.\r\nThose essences and our spirit were present here in\r\nNew York, in the street carnival on Labour Day, on\r\nMonday. Those essences and that spirit were also\r\ncelebrated last week in Europes largest street festival,\r\nthe Notting Hill Carnival.\r\nYou see it, too, whenever you hear the music of\r\nthe steel bands anywhere in the world. Notwithstanding\r\nour modest achievements, small and developing\r\ncountries such as Trinidad and Tobago and our sister\r\nCaribbean States face additional challenges and threats,\r\namong them, the danger of marginalization in the now\r\nevident realities of globalization and technological\r\nadvance.\r\nWe also face the paradox that while our small\r\neconomies continue to be genuinely vulnerable to\r\nexternal factors, while our fragile ecosystems are\r\nimperilled by developments not of our making, our\r\ngraduation to per capita middle-income status\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\neffectively denies us adequate consideration for the\r\ndevelopmental support we so urgently need.\r\nOur small economies are confronted by a\r\nchanging trade environment in which the principle of\r\nspecial and differential treatment is being phased out.\r\nThe international response that can enable us to\r\ndevelop the necessary capacity to exploit the\r\nopportunities presented by globalization has been\r\ndecidedly less than adequate.\r\nThe 37 small island developing States, members\r\nof the United Nations, have special developmental\r\nneeds which this Summit and the United Nations must\r\nnot overlook. Over the years, Caribbean Community\r\nStates have petitioned the international community for\r\nrecognition of the Caribbean as a special area for\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe have also sought support for the protection of\r\nthe Caribbean Sea as an environmental treasure for the\r\nworld. Now, we recognize the threat of new\r\nmarginalization by the new disparities that come with\r\nthe digital divide. On this score, we urge the United\r\nNations to ensure equitable coordination in the field of\r\nscience and technology, particularly information\r\ntechnology.\r\nNext year the United Nations will host a high\r\nlevel forum on financing for development. The World\r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund and the World\r\nTrade Organization will take part in that conference.\r\nWe make an early petition for the forum to produce an\r\naction plan that will include a framework for financial\r\ncrisis prevention and crisis resolution based on\r\npartnership between public and private sectors.\r\nWe also make an early petition for a resolution\r\nfrom the financing development forum to give\r\nborrowing countries a substantial role in determining\r\neconomic and social development objectives.\r\nI take this opportunity to place on record the\r\ngratitude of Trinidad and Tobago for the pivotal role\r\nplayed by the United Nations in addressing all the\r\nsocial issues facing humanity. We record our\r\nappreciation for the United Nations positive response\r\nwhen Trinidad and Tobago moved to revive the concept\r\nof the establishment of a permanent International\r\nCriminal Court. It is our firm conviction that the crime\r\nof illicit drug trafficking should be included in the\r\nCourts jurisdiction. And after listening this morning to\r\nthe President of Ghana, Jerry Rawlings, I add the crime\r\nof corruption.\r\nWhile we examine the global concerns on our\r\nSummit agenda, most of us are preoccupied with the\r\nchallenges with which we must come to terms in our\r\nown communities and our own countries. We must\r\nprovide shelter, nutrition, health services, education\r\nand training, and security for our people, and we must,\r\nthrough our policies, deliver jobs. We must also\r\ndirectly provide assistance to those of our citizens who\r\nare still trapped in poverty.\r\nIt is our sincere hope that this Millennium\r\nSummit will in some small measure persuade the\r\ndecision makers of the world, in the private sector and\r\nin the international agencies, that such human concerns\r\ndeserve to be an important factor in all future planning.\r\nMay the blessings that we ask of God find full\r\nexpression in the prosperity of all peoples of the world\r\nand in peace among all peoples of all nations.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): Before I give\r\nthe floor to the next speaker, I appeal for respect for the\r\nlimit on the length of statements. Members are aware\r\nthat there are still 12 speakers remaining on the list of\r\nspeakers for this meeting. Since we must exhaust the\r\nlist for each meeting, I appeal to participants in the\r\nMillennium Summit to respect the five minute\r\nspeaking time allotted to each speaker. This will allow\r\nus to hear all the speakers on the list before we adjourn\r\nfor lunch this afternoon.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Principality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Molné (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan) (English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): We are meeting today\r\nin New York, at the seat of the United Nations, to\r\ncelebrate 2,000 years of our calendar. One thousand\r\nyears ago the roads had become unsafe, the\r\nphilosophies of the ancients had been put to one side to\r\nawait the Renaissance and human beings eked out an\r\nexistence in fear and poverty in a divided and unsafe\r\nEurope.\r\nNow, in the year 2000, science has freed us from\r\nmany diseases and some superstitions. The bloody wars\r\nof the twentieth century and the atomic age have made\r\nus aware of our immense and brutal capacity for self-\r\ndestruction. The rationalism and liberalism of the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the failure of\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nauthoritarian and totalitarian models have led to the\r\nadvance of modern democracy, which is indisputably\r\nthe best system of government for human communities.\r\nOne hundred and eighty-nine sovereign nations\r\nare meeting under the auspices of the United Nations in\r\na spirit of planetary solidarity at a time of globalization\r\nand instant communication. Mankind has never been\r\ncloser to the promised land, but at the same time we\r\nhave never been so aware of the dangers hindering us\r\nfrom reaching it.\r\nThe peace of nations cannot be built, as in the\r\nyear 0, on the supremacy of an empire, whether\r\npolitical or economic. The Governments of the world\r\nmust lead globalization to areas of true cooperation\r\nbetween north and south, between large and small,\r\nbecause political globalization cannot come into being\r\nat the cost of small countries. Small human\r\ncommunities such as the Principality of Andorra, the\r\npeaceful heirs of a long history of democracy, must be\r\nable to maintain their presence without losing their\r\nidentity. If political globalization does not include the\r\nsmall States, we shall be less in all possible meanings\r\nof the word.\r\nThe year 2000 should be remembered as the year\r\nof courage and not as the year of fear, like the year\r\n1000. The greatest Assembly in the history of the rulers\r\nof the earth is to be found in this Hall. Today we know\r\nwhere good and evil lie. The San Francisco Charter and\r\nthe 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights leave\r\nno room for doubt.\r\nIn the coming years we must have the courage to\r\nspeak out frankly. We must have the courage to\r\ncondemn dictatorships, even if they have been set up in\r\ncountries which are important for our economy. We\r\nmust have the courage to opt jointly for policies of\r\nsolidarity rather than reasons of State. This must be the\r\nyear of ethics and courage and the beginning of a\r\ncentury of valour.\r\nThe attendance of high representatives at\r\ninternational conferences must be visible and\r\ncontinuous. I am sorry to have to regret the lack of\r\ninterest aroused by the conference on social\r\ndevelopment that began in Geneva on the 26 June this\r\nyear, unlike the 1995 Copenhagen summit, where\r\nnearly all of us were in the official photograph.\r\nAndorra gives its full support to the millennium\r\nreport (A/54/2000) of the Secretary-General, Kofi\r\nAnnan. There must be fair globalization, reduction of\r\nthe abject poverty which grinds down half of mankind\r\nand a safer world which acts more to prevent conflicts\r\nthan to react to them. There must be much less military\r\nexpenditure and much more medical research into\r\nAIDS, which is killing thousands in Africa and all over\r\nthe world.\r\nMr. Gurirab (Namibia) took the Chair.\r\nWe also want more awareness and defence of the\r\nnatural environment. But, although we in the small\r\nStates are making great efforts to respect nature to the\r\nmaximum, we shall always feel that the big States have\r\nto do the real work, and the fact is that they are not\r\ndoing it. To the contrary, they are refusing to sign\r\nprotocols and refusing to limit the unsustainable\r\ngrowth which characterizes those States, and in this\r\nmanner, they are changing the climate of the whole\r\nworld. It is obvious that we are all to blame in some\r\nmeasure when we follow blindly along the road of\r\nindustrial consumption. At this summit these questions,\r\nwhich will condition life in the century we are\r\nbeginning, must be discussed.\r\nWe have taken note of the invitation of the\r\nSecretary-General in his report, and we are taking\r\nadvantage of this Summit meeting to sign the two\r\nOptional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child, on the involvement of children in armed\r\nconflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution\r\nand child pornography.\r\nWe have also given our support to the initiative of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary\r\nRobinson, with regard to the declaration Tolerance\r\nand diversity: a vision for the 21st century, because\r\nour land, Andorra, has much to say about questions of\r\ndiversity and tolerance. We have lived through the wars\r\nof our neighbours and other wars in Europe. Refugees\r\nhave always found help and peace with us. In the\r\nsecond half of the twentieth century, Andorra was host\r\nto immigrants, which multiplied its population by a\r\nfactor of more than eight. All of us who live there try\r\nto make tolerance and respect for diversity more than\r\nmere words. We must learn how to welcome the\r\ndiversity of human beings and of nations and, at the\r\nsame time, establish global values about what is or is\r\nnot legitimate. This is the great challenge for the future\r\nof humankind: managing to respect the cultural\r\ndiversity of all while refusing to accept excuses, based\r\n36\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\non culture or religion, for failing to apply all the norms\r\nof democracy and human rights.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Mikulá Dzurinda, Prime Minister of the Slovak\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Dzurinda (Slovakia): At the dawn of a new\r\nmillennium, the human race is going through\r\nfundamental changes, within a global context, that are\r\nbound to have a significant impact on the future of\r\nhumanity in the twenty-first century in all walks of life.\r\nApart from triggering the process of democratization,\r\nthe end of the cold war and the demise of the bipolar\r\nworld brought forth new opportunities for many\r\ncountries to enhance their international cooperation\r\nand, in some cases, achieve rapprochement. At the\r\nsame time, however, it raised new challenges for the\r\ncurrent generation and, in some ways, for the very\r\nconstruction of multilateralism, based on the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe end of this century has been marked by an\r\nescalation of negative phenomena, including intra-State\r\nconflicts, accompanied by humanitarian crises of tragic\r\ndimensions; gross violations of human rights;\r\nglobalization, which, apart from its economic benefits,\r\nhas had a number of negative social consequences,\r\nsuch as the widening gap between the rich and the\r\npoor; new threats to the environment; organized crime;\r\ndrugs; disease; the proliferation of illegal weapons; and\r\na soaring number of refugees throughout the globe.\r\nHaving come face to face with these challenges,\r\nthe United Nations has justified its mission. The\r\nSlovak Republic is convinced that the United Nations\r\nplays an irreplaceable role in tackling a whole range of\r\nglobal issues, the solution of which by individual\r\nMember States on an individual or regional basis has\r\nproved to be practically impossible. The Slovak\r\nRepublic, like other States Members of the United\r\nNations, is aware of the necessity for the United\r\nNations to undertake overall reform. This necessity has\r\nbecome particularly apparent in the light of the recent\r\nconflicts in the Balkans and the protracted conflicts in\r\nAfrica, such as those in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Sierra Leone.\r\nIn this context, I wish to emphasize that United\r\nNations reform cannot be complete without the reform\r\nof the Security Council, as that is the key body of the\r\nUnited Nations responsible for preserving international\r\npeace and security. An increase in the number of\r\nSecurity Council members and an improvement in the\r\nefficiency of its decision-making process and the\r\ntransparency of its activities would increase the\r\nauthority, representative character, credibility and\r\nefficiency of the Security Council in the future.\r\nOur planet is a shared home for all of mankind.\r\nThat is why the efficient resolution of global issues\r\nrequires the active involvement of civil society and the\r\nprivate sector. In this context, the Slovak Republic\r\nsupports the initiative of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral with regard to the private sector, as expressed\r\nin his appeal for the adoption of the Global Compact of\r\nShared Values and Principles in the area of human\r\nrights, labour and employment and the environment.\r\nSlovakia also supports the proposals put forward\r\nby the United Nations Secretary-General with regard to\r\nthe fields of social development, the standard of living,\r\nhealth care and the eradication of poverty.\r\nThe experience gained by the Slovak Republic\r\nfrom its involvement in United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions bears witness to the potential of the small-\r\nand medium-sized countries for active participation in\r\nensuring peace and stability worldwide.\r\nStanding on the threshold of the new century, the\r\ninternational community must focus its endeavours on\r\nensuring full respect for international law and, in\r\nparticular, human rights, violations of which have\r\nrecently been grave and numerous. Hence, Slovakia\r\nfully supports the expedient constitution of an\r\nInternational Criminal Court and subscribes to the\r\nSecretary-Generals appeal to put an end to the culture\r\nof impunity.\r\nGlobal developments lead us to reiterate the\r\nuniversal validity of the need to respect the human\r\nrights and personal freedoms of individuals as basic\r\nprerequisites for the freedom of nations and for their\r\ndynamic social and economic development and\r\nharmonious coexistence worldwide. The Slovak\r\nRepublic is firmly determined to take an active part in\r\ndefending and ensuring that respect.\r\nThe peace, security, prosperity and development\r\nof humanity in the forthcoming century will test our\r\nability to combine traditional concepts, derived from\r\nthe idea of the sovereignty of States, as the basic\r\nelements of international law, with new principles that\r\nare based on global respect for fundamental human\r\n37\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nrights and on the accountability of individual States to\r\nthe international community for the breaches of such\r\nrights. These new ideas and principles should spark\r\ndebates among nations and, ultimately, result in a\r\nbroad-based agreement within the international\r\ncommunity, as was the case 55 years ago when the\r\nUnited Nations Charter was adopted.\r\nThis Organization faces many challenges. Allow\r\nme to express my conviction that, when the process of\r\ninternal reforms has been accomplished, the United\r\nNations will be able to react to each and every one of\r\nthese challenges with the utmost tact and efficiency.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Costas Simitis, Prime Minister of the Hellenic\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Simitis (Greece): The twentieth century has\r\nbequeathed to us admirable achievements in almost all\r\nfields of human activity. In 100 years, the world has\r\nachieved unprecedented results in the sciences,\r\ntechnology and communication. It has developed and\r\nrefined ideas and practices on social cohesion,\r\ndemocratic governance, the protection of human\r\ndignity and the application of the rules of law,\r\ntranscending national barriers and mentalities. The\r\nUnited Nations has played its part in assisting the\r\ntransformation of the international community into a\r\nliving organism, partaking of the same values and\r\nprinciples. The United Nations has greatly contributed\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nand the creation of new equilibriums in relations\r\nbetween States, as well as to the redistribution of\r\nwealth between rich and poor countries.\r\nYet, neither the United Nations, nor the\r\ninternational community as a whole have succeeded in\r\neradicating the scourges, which from time immemorial\r\nhave cast shadows on the prosperity of humanity. We\r\nare still witnessing, in alarming dimensions, poverty\r\nand malnutrition, social exclusion, deadly diseases, as\r\nwell as incessant waves of international and internal\r\nconflicts of extreme violence. At the same time, the\r\nvery beneficial human achievements, of which we are\r\nall proud, have brought with them negative\r\nconsequences, hindering the environment, destroying\r\nthe quality of human life, threatening sometimes the\r\nvery basis upon which we have built international and\r\ninternal solidarity and respect for the fundamental rules\r\nof humanity.\r\nOur task, therefore, must be to find new avenues\r\nthrough which we will control and gradually eradicate\r\nthe causes of the scourges that torment all our lives.\r\nThis task requires co-operation  cooperation at all\r\nlevels  but mainly and, most importantly, at the\r\nglobal level because it would otherwise be difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to have positive results in our world of\r\nclose interdependence. We strongly believe that the\r\nUnited Nations has a serious role to play in this\r\nrespect. Its experience, its past achievements in all\r\nthese fields, its nature as the only political international\r\norganization with universal participation, coupled with\r\nits specialized organs and agencies, are solid material\r\nupon which we may rely in our fight against the\r\nproblems of our world. But, it goes without saying, that\r\nin order for the United Nations system to effectively\r\ncope with this heavy burden, it must be duly\r\nempowered both institutionally and materially. Greece\r\nbelieves that it is necessary to strengthen the position\r\nand the role of the main organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council, in particular, needs\r\ncomprehensive reform in order to become more\r\nrepresentative and far more effective. Its long history\r\nand involvement in international affairs has\r\ndemonstrated that its inability to solve problems of\r\nmagnitude is due both to its structural deficiencies,\r\nwhich date back to its institutional inception, as well as\r\nto the unwillingness of Member States to give it room\r\nto become effectively involved in matters where State\r\nsovereignty and vital interests are considered to\r\noverride international concerns.\r\nWe have in the last few days heard about many\r\nproblems that have remained unsolved for years even\r\nthough the United Nations has taken relevant decisions.\r\nThe Cyprus problem is an example. We should not\r\nallow this situation to continue any longer.\r\nNow that we are all aware of the dangers\r\nsurrounding us, as well as of the United Nations\r\npotential to deal with them properly, it would be\r\nunimaginable and unreasonable for us to waste such a\r\ncomprehensive system and not to make full use of its\r\nprecious services to secure peace and amicable\r\nrelations and to fight all deficiencies in the world order\r\nto which we have just referred.\r\nThe United Nations can be an effective tool to\r\nsolve our problems  the problems of the new world.\r\nIt has the multilateral framework. We can and should,\r\nall of us, make full use of it.\r\n38\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Highness\r\nSheikh Hamad Bin Mohammad Al-Sharqi, Member of\r\nthe Supreme Council, Ruler of the Emirate of\r\nAl-Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Mohammad\r\nAl-Sharqi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nOn behalf of His Highness Sheikh Zayid Bin Sultan\r\nAl-Nahayan, President of the State of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, I have the honour to convey his greetings and\r\nregards to the President of the Republic of Namibia and\r\nthe President of Finland for co-chairing this historic\r\nSummit.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates looks to this\r\nMillennium Summit with high hopes of achieving\r\njustice and equality among all the peoples of the world\r\nand of reinforcing the bonds of joint cooperation in\r\ndealing with injustice, violence, terrorism, illiteracy,\r\norganized crime, the elimination of poverty and\r\ncontagious diseases and a horde of other contemporary\r\ninternational problems.\r\nWhile we emphasize our true desire to seriously\r\nwork with all the nations and peoples of the world in\r\norder to achieve the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and preserve peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in our region and in the world at\r\nlarge, we call for respect for the principles of\r\nrenunciation of violence, non-use of force and the\r\nresolution of disputes through dialogue and by peaceful\r\nmeans.\r\nHence, the United Arab Emirates persists in its\r\nendeavours to find a just solution to the dispute with\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran arising from Irans\r\noccupation in 1971 of the three islands that belong to\r\nthe United Arab Emirates  Greater Tunb, Lesser\r\nTunb and Abu Musa. We call upon Iran to respond to\r\nour declared initiative to peacefully resolve this dispute\r\nin accordance with the principles and rules of\r\ninternational law, either through direct negotiations or\r\nby resorting to the International Court of Justice. We\r\nare confident that such a step would strengthen and\r\ncement the bilateral and collective relations between\r\nthe States of the region, and indeed contribute to\r\nconsolidating the foundations of regional and\r\ninternational peace, security and stability.\r\nIn this context also, we call upon the international\r\ncommunity, including Iraq, to exert further political\r\nand diplomatic efforts to alleviate the human suffering\r\nof the fraternal Iraqi people. In doing so we underline\r\nthe need for the Iraqi Government to complete its\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, particularly regarding prisoners of war and\r\nother detainees who are citizens of the sisterly State of\r\nKuwait and of other countries, and the restitution of\r\nKuwaiti property.\r\nAchieving a just and comprehensive peace in the\r\nMiddle East requires a commitment on the part of the\r\nIsraeli Government to implement the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions, particularly Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Those\r\nresolutions call for ending the illegal Israeli occupation\r\nof Palestinian land and other occupied Arab territories,\r\nparticularly Al-Quds al-Sharif and the Syrian Golan;\r\nthe return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland;\r\nand the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to\r\nestablish their own independent State, with Jerusalem\r\nas its capital.\r\nIn welcoming the efforts made by the United\r\nStates of America and other countries to arrive at a\r\njust, equitable and comprehensive resolution of the\r\nPalestine issue, we call for those efforts to be sustained\r\nin order to bring about the resumption of negotiations\r\non the Syrian track, so that the countries and the\r\npeoples of the region may enjoy security, stability and\r\nprosperity. Also in this regard, we would like to\r\nexpress our congratulations to fraternal Lebanon on\r\nregaining its territories, and to wish it continued\r\nprosperity and progress.\r\nDespite the multidimensional economic growth\r\nthat has characterized developments in international\r\neconomic relations, we are concerned about problems\r\nand challenges that developing countries have to\r\nendure, particularly at a time when global events have\r\nproved that international economic growth and stability\r\nrequire the participation of developing and developed\r\ncountries alike. Globalization represents both a\r\nphenomenon and an important event in international\r\nrelations. Accordingly, it must be utilized to serve the\r\ncommon interests and objectives of humanity.\r\nThe United Nations is still the most appropriate\r\ninternational forum for dealing with contemporary\r\nregional and international issues such as limiting the\r\nproliferation of proscribed weapons, cases of foreign\r\noccupation, poverty and debt, environmental pollution\r\nand similar issues. Therefore, we call for the reform of\r\nthe Organization, especially the General Assembly and\r\n39\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nthe Security Council, in order to enable them to deal\r\neffectively with those challenges and phenomena.\r\nIn conclusion, we trust that the Millennium\r\nSummit will mark the start of a new era in international\r\nrelations in which tolerance, peaceful coexistence,\r\nstability and respect for international law prevail and\r\nlead to a better life for all humankind.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Serene\r\nHighness Crown Prince Albert, Crown Prince of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco.\r\nCrown Prince Albert (Monaco) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The time of dreams and utopias has been\r\nfollowed by a more rigorous one, that of commercial\r\nrealities. Political power has often found it difficult to\r\nprevail in the face of the growing influence of the\r\nglobalized economy. The rules of the great planetary\r\ngame are changing. This is a fact, not merely an\r\nopinion.\r\nPeoples are confused. Many States are wounded\r\nand in disarray. Even the most powerful nations are in\r\ndoubt. They see, not without bitterness, that they can\r\nno longer build history by themselves. Because\r\nscientific and technological progress have been so\r\ntremendous, and because the political, economic and\r\nsocial changes flowing from that progress are so rapid\r\nand deep, the millennium to come is an unknown. The\r\nSan Francisco Charter is the only remaining immutable\r\npoint of reference.\r\nThe Charter expresses the wisdom of nations, the\r\nrejection of war and violence in all its forms, and the\r\nneed for collective security on the basis of respect for\r\nthe independence, dignity and sovereignty of States,\r\nincluding the smallest among them. It also expresses\r\nthe firm resolve to cooperate actively for the promotion\r\nof human rights and economic and social development.\r\nOur Organization must necessarily adapt in order to be\r\nable to assume its mandate. It can do so, and it is doing\r\nso at its own pace. That pace is imposed upon it by the\r\ncomplexity of its institutions and the often conflicting\r\ninterests of its Members.\r\nIn terms of international security, the\r\nOrganization expresses itself clearly. Today, it is better\r\nable to identify the causes of disputes and share the\r\nresponsibility for their management. It must have more\r\neffective means to prevent those disputes, and to that\r\nend it should no doubt resort more frequently to\r\ncarrying out research on peace and on the causes of\r\nconflict and violence. It must also more effectively\r\ncombat threats other than military ones: terrorism; drug\r\ntrafficking; trafficking in human beings, including the\r\nweakest among them, children; and the misdeeds\r\nresulting from funds of criminal origin.\r\nIt is no doubt in the field of disarmament that\r\nprogress runs the risk of being slowest. Only the trust\r\nthat our Organization can maintain among its Members\r\nwill guarantee success in this area, so vital to the\r\nfuture.\r\nIn terms of human rights and humanitarian law,\r\nthe United Nations has gained a set of remarkable\r\ninstruments whose implementation will no doubt\r\ncontinue, albeit too slowly. It will be necessary for the\r\nOrganization to ensure the strengthening and smooth\r\nfunctioning of bodies entrusted with their promotion in\r\norder to ensure the well-being and development of all\r\nhuman beings, in the present and in the future,\r\nregardless of their place of birth or residence. The\r\nOrganization should also examine carefully how the\r\nnew economic and financial powers are behaving with\r\nregard to human rights, in particular as concerns\r\neconomic, social and cultural rights.\r\nIn terms of development, the metamorphosis of\r\nthe Organization is complete. It constantly recalls that\r\neconomic progress must also be social progress and\r\nthat it must be in the service of mankind as a whole. Its\r\napproach is a pragmatic one, and its action is\r\nincreasingly concrete. It will also be essential for our\r\nOrganization to endeavour, within the context of the\r\nirreversible process of globalization, to respect cultural\r\nand linguistic diversity, through which peoples have\r\nnourished their roots and built their identities.\r\nIn terms of the environment, the Organization has\r\nbeen able to single out the true priorities and to warn\r\npeople about the most serious threats to nature, which\r\nsometimes cannot be corrected. Over the past few\r\nyears, the Organization has been able to develop\r\necological standards, which we must apply diligently\r\nand quickly.\r\nFinally, today our Organization knows how to\r\npursue its legitimate aspirations with regard to justice.\r\nNew paths are opening up, paths of hope. Our\r\nOrganization must deepen those channels in order to\r\nrespond as quickly as possible to peoples demands and\r\nsensitivities in this area. We have entrusted the\r\nOrganization with the drafting and promotion of\r\n40\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nstandards and principles that are our most valuable\r\nheritage. It is our duty to enable the United Nations to\r\ncontinue to improve in carrying out these lofty\r\nmissions.\r\nWe heads of State and Government, the\r\nrepresentatives of billions of men and women, must\r\nthank the United Nations for its efforts, support it and,\r\nin particular, encourage it. The political Declaration we\r\nwill adopt, to which the Principality of Monaco adheres\r\nfully, will guide the Organizations first steps in the\r\ndawn of the next millennium. We need more than ever\r\na universal Organization, one that is active and\r\nresponsible and guided by the most urgent needs of\r\npeoples, especially of the most disadvantaged. We hope\r\nfor an Organization that will be a moral reference point\r\nfor conducting the affairs of the world with integrity.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco, one of the smallest\r\nof its Members in size and population, bears proof,\r\nthrough its age-old history, that military and economic\r\npower is not sufficient to ensure the endurance of\r\nStates. Their survival and development and the\r\nhappiness of their people can, we believe, be firmly\r\nfounded only in peaceful and harmonious relations\r\namong nations that are themselves inspired by equity\r\nand justice, as well as by respect for international law\r\nand universal ethics.\r\nIn opening itself more broadly to civil society; in\r\ncooperating more closely with economic agents; in\r\ninvolving public and private institutions on a more\r\nregular basis in its initiatives; and in radically\r\nexploiting the means of mass communication,\r\nincluding digital, the United Nations is striving to\r\nlisten attentively to the peoples and, as its Charter calls\r\non it to do, to act more effectively on their behalf. We\r\nwelcome this and congratulate the Organization on it.\r\nThe remarkable report issued by its Secretary-General\r\nfurther encourages us to do so and incites us to pay a\r\ntribute to the 50,000 international civil servants for\r\ntheir admirable devotion and selflessness \r\nsometimes, as yesterday, at the peril of their lives.\r\nWe sincerely hope that our Organization will be\r\nable to pursue its noble mandates with greater\r\nauthority. We reaffirm our trust in it, and do so without\r\nreservation and in the strength of conviction.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, First\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwish to convey the greetings of His Highness, the Amir\r\nof the State of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-\r\nJaber Al-Sabah, who wishes this Summit every\r\nsuccess. I have the honour to read out his statement\r\nbefore the Assembly:\r\nThe Prophets message was to guide\r\nmankind along the righteous paths, showing the\r\nway to justice, security and peace. Its ultimate\r\npurpose is to help mankind to live a safe, secure\r\nand dignified life.\r\nOn the other hand, Allah bestowed on\r\nhumanity the great trust of being endowed with a\r\nmind, the architect of all of our personal and\r\nworldly affairs. Thus, the human race was\r\nentrusted with the stewardship of all aspects of\r\nlife on Earth, its water resources and outer space.\r\nInasmuch as human beings are entrusted with the\r\nresponsibility to conserve nature, they are\r\nrequired to harness all natural resources to their\r\nbenefit. The rational and appropriate use of these\r\nresources must be exercised with a view to\r\navoiding environmental damage and degradation.\r\nIn the final analysis, however, humanity is\r\na confusion of conflicting good and evil\r\ntendencies. Surreptitiously, the evil elements may\r\ngain mastery of an individual, turning him or her\r\ninto what may appear to be a tool of chaos and\r\ndestruction; similarly, a person may fall prey to\r\nselfishness and greed to the point at which he or\r\nshe may be lured into denying others access to\r\nthe bounty of the universe.\r\nSome of us may occasionally feel that\r\nhumanity is paying inadequate attention to the\r\nfuture of this planet, in view of the existing\r\nstockpiles of the implements of death and\r\ndestruction and the relentless efforts made to\r\ndevelop and enlarge those arsenals of lethal and\r\nhighly sophisticated death machines and materiel.\r\nIn fact, there is an even more dangerous threat to\r\nhuman life: those elements who act in ways that\r\nare harmful and demeaning to the well-being and\r\ndignity of their fellow human beings. Looking\r\naround us, we can see in too many parts of the\r\nworld people who incite sedition, hatred,\r\ndiscrimination, selfishness and chauvinism.\r\n41\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nThese attitudes may in the end prove more\r\ndestructive than lethal weaponry. In retrospect,\r\nwe find that human societies have suffered in the\r\npast and continue to endure tragedies and\r\nmassacres, even as we speak, as a result of those\r\nattitudes, which lead to the subjugation of too\r\nmany people to repression and deprivation. The\r\nharmful exploitation and mismanagement of\r\nnatural resources that sometimes occur through\r\ntyranny and narrow self-interest expose vast\r\nnumbers of people to the pressures and anguish of\r\npoverty and destitution while, at the same time,\r\nother segments of human society enjoy\r\ncomfortable lives free from epidemics, illiteracy\r\nand want.\r\nThese preoccupations have dogged us for\r\ndecades. Towards the end of the last century, we\r\nhad hoped that humanity would at least have\r\nsucceeded in alleviating their impact even if it\r\nwas largely unable to resolve them. Alas,\r\nhowever, reality has defeated our aspirations.\r\nIndeed, in some respects, the situation is quite\r\ndepressing, as we see these problems being\r\nexacerbated in terms of intensity, scope and\r\nhuman losses. This melancholy picture mars the\r\ncelebration of our passage into the twenty-first\r\ncentury. It also casts a long, gloomy shadow over\r\nwhat would perhaps seem the greater part of the\r\nnew century.\r\nNevertheless, we remain hopeful that the\r\nnew century will hold the promise of humanitys\r\nraising itself above those pernicious phenomena.\r\nIt is also our hope that, in the new century,\r\nhumanity will demonstrate improved rationality\r\nin the interests of mutual benefit and more\r\ncivility in its interactions. We hope that humanity\r\nwill collectively focus more on improving living\r\nconditions across the globe and on addressing its\r\nproblems more effectively with a view to\r\nensuring the universal safety and freedom from\r\nfear of all peoples. The conservation and\r\nimprovement of our human environment should\r\nalways be at the heart of our endeavours if we are\r\nto ensure that this planet remains healthy and\r\nhospitable to our future generations.\r\nOur work today is characterized by\r\nglobalization, colossal economic blocs and fast-\r\nadvancing technology. It is a world that is more\r\naware of and sensitive to human suffering\r\nwherever it occurs. It is also a world that has\r\nbecome more responsive and willing to reach out\r\nwith relief and humanitarian assistance across\r\nnational and regional borders. Nevertheless, we\r\ncontinue to be challenged by intense racial and\r\nsectarian violence, the persistent outbreak of\r\ndiseases and natural disasters, and an entire array\r\nof problems, as the Secretary-General has rightly\r\noutlined in his report.\r\nIf we are to achieve better living\r\nconditions in the new century, those challenges\r\nmust be faced squarely by drawing on human\r\nresolve, ingenuity and innovation. The bottom\r\nline in our common battle is the need to mount\r\njoint and well-coordinated international efforts to\r\nstem the tide of those problems, or at least to\r\ncontain them or mitigate their impact. This may\r\nrequire some new modalities for international\r\ncontributions and burden-sharing within the\r\nframework of thoughtful and agreed platforms\r\nand plans of actions. In our view, such moves\r\nwould certainly help to promote understanding\r\namong peoples and civilizations and further\r\nconsolidate world peace and security.\r\nSimilarly, the international community,\r\nrepresented by the United Nations, should spare\r\nno effort in its collective endeavour to reject any\r\nattempt to resolve differences among nations\r\noutside the parameters of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and the\r\noverarching concepts of peace. The United\r\nNations system must remain the primary and final\r\nresort for the resolution of international disputes\r\nand its rulings must be respected and upheld by\r\nall its Members.\r\nIn the same spirit, however, we must now\r\nreaffirm our commitment at the individual level\r\nto rejecting any form of human slavery or denial\r\nof human rights, regardless of the excuses and\r\ncircumstances cited to justify them by any\r\npolitical system or regime, even if that violation\r\nwas committed by the Government of the\r\nindividuals own homeland.\r\nIn this context, we cannot tolerate the\r\nabduction of innocent hostages by a totalitarian\r\nregime that continues to hold them as political\r\nbargaining chips. The families of those detainees\r\ncontinue to anguish over the plight of their loved\r\n42\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nones, while the hostages themselves languish in\r\npain. The sense of loss and frustration runs deep\r\namong those families who continue to pin their\r\nhopes on the international community to hold that\r\nregime accountable and to compel it to release\r\nthose innocent victims and to account for their\r\nwhereabouts.\r\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that\r\nthe twenty-first century will be free of war\r\ncriminals and perpetrators of massacres,\r\nincluding those who plan for and participate in\r\nsuch crimes against humanity. We fervently hope\r\nthat the new century, which is three months away,\r\nwill prove to be free of wars, epidemics, greed\r\nand conflicts. Let us hope that we can channel our\r\nenergy and resources into preserving our home,\r\nthe planet Earth, which has suffered immense\r\ndamage in the course of the past century.\r\nCan we close ranks and work together in\r\nunison to meet this universal challenge? Can we\r\ntruly pool our efforts to make the world a more\r\nfriendly environment for our children?\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that many\r\nworld leaders share the same desire. After all, this\r\nis the desire of just about every human being. So,\r\nlet us work to translate it into a tangible reality.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Tarik Aziz, Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq.\r\nMr. Aziz (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): We would like\r\nto express our best wishes to the peoples of the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century, which we hope will\r\nbe a century of peace, justice and progress for all.\r\nIt is true that this occasion is an opportunity for\r\ncontemplation. To be meaningful, this contemplation\r\nshould be sincere. Hence, let me present our vision and\r\nconcerns sincerely and frankly.\r\nWhen we discuss the role of the United Nations\r\nin the twenty-first century, we all agree on the\r\nimportance attached to the Organizations success in\r\nfacing up to future challenges and other longstanding\r\nchallenges that continue to elude us. To be effective in\r\nmeeting such challenges, the United Nations should\r\nindeed reflect the will of all its peoples.\r\nThe United Nations Charter was drafted on this\r\nbasis. Furthermore, its provisions have stipulated that\r\nthe interest sought should be the common and\r\ncollective interest. However, the most important fact of\r\nthe past era was that the ability to properly apply the\r\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter was not often\r\npossible, due to the influences of the powerful States\r\nthat dominated the making of international resolutions\r\nfor their own interests. This situation was aggravated\r\nduring the 1990s as a result of United States hegemony\r\nand domination over the international Organization for\r\nthe benefit of its imperialist objectives. Thus, the work\r\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century should\r\nbe directed in the first place towards resuming the\r\nproper application of the Charter and the prevention of\r\nhegemony over United Nations resolutions and\r\npositions.\r\nThe essential step in this move would be to\r\nreform the decision-making process in the United\r\nNations, particularly the Security Council, so that it\r\ncould really reflect the will of all Member States. There\r\nis no guarantee, of course, for the proper application of\r\nthe United Nations Charter unless all States, both large\r\nand small, adhere to the principles of the Charter,\r\nparticularly the principle of equal sovereignty of\r\nStates, without which the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century would be an extension of the status quo.\r\nWe disagree with the optimistic picture of\r\nglobalization drawn up in the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport. We do not think that globalization will bring\r\nabout benefits for all. What we have seen so far is that\r\nthe benefits of globalization are concentrated in a few\r\nStates.\r\nThe essence of globalization is to achieve\r\neconomic hegemony by the few rich States, the United\r\nStates of America in particular, as well as\r\noverwhelming dominance by Western consumer\r\nculture, thus threatening the cultures of other peoples,\r\ntheir different lifestyles and their system of spiritual\r\nvalues.\r\nFurthermore, we view with considerable\r\nscepticism the invitation to transnational corporations\r\nand non-governmental organizations to participate in\r\nthe work of the United Nations, and we stress the need\r\nfor studying in depth the criteria for such partnership,\r\nits corresponding obligations and preventing its having\r\nan adverse impact on the principles of international\r\norganizations as set forth in the Charter, such as equal\r\nsovereignty among States and non-interference.\r\n43\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nIronically, the United Nations, whose Charter\r\nprovides for the protection of human rights and human\r\ndignity, accepts being a tool for violating such\r\nfundamental human rights, through the comprehensive\r\nand unrestricted use of the sanctions system,\r\nnotwithstanding the suffering those sanctions inflict\r\nupon the targeted peoples.\r\nIn the case of Iraq, the Iraqi victims of these\r\nunjust and unrestricted sanctions have amounted to\r\nmore than a million children, women and elderly\r\npeople during the past 10 years. Therefore, it is not\r\nenough to admit that sanctions are an ineffective tool\r\nleading to counterproductive results, and it is not\r\nenough to dubiously call for directing them in a better\r\nway; rather, the use of these sanctions should be\r\nrestricted, and they should not trespass upon the scope\r\nof the United Nations Charter. Also, they should not be\r\nheld hostage, as in the case of Iraq, to the will of the\r\nUnited States of America, which hijacked the\r\nresolution on the lifting of sanctions on Iraq from the\r\nSecurity Council to exploit it in the service of its own\r\ninterests and hostile policies.\r\nThe United Nations cannot escape its moral\r\nresponsibility for the consequences of the application\r\nof sanctions. This responsibility starts once the\r\nsanctions are imposed, rather than after their\r\ncatastrophic consequences have unfolded.\r\nWe view with caution and scepticism the so-\r\ncalled concept of humanitarian intervention, since this\r\ncall may be used  and, in fact, has been used  to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of States by other States,\r\nparticularly the dominating Power, the United States of\r\nAmerica. We disagree with the assumption that the\r\nprinciples of sovereignty and humanitarian\r\ninternational law are at variance and that we have to\r\nchoose one of them.\r\nAs regards the main challenges the world faces in\r\nthe twenty-first century, particularly freedom from\r\npoverty and securing an ecologically safe future for\r\ncoming generations, we believe that success in meeting\r\nthese challenges depends on the cooperation of all\r\nStates. In this context, the rich industrial countries have\r\nto bear the biggest brunt of this confrontation due to\r\ntheir economic capabilities, as well as in view of their\r\nresponsibility for creating and maintaining these\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Win Aung, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nMyanmar.\r\nMr. Aung (Myanmar): The world that we live in\r\ntoday is different from that of the founders of the\r\nUnited Nations. In the intervening half century, the\r\nworld has witnessed momentous changes  some for\r\nthe better, some for the worse.\r\nWe have made huge strides in the field of\r\ntechnology. The world population has surpassed the\r\n6 billion mark. The world has the ability to feed the\r\nteeming billions. However, people living in dire\r\npoverty and millions dying of hunger are common\r\nphenomena.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, we must\r\nstrengthen our Organization so that it will be able to\r\ncope with new challenges and new realities.\r\nMembers of the United Nations, each in its own\r\nway, are trying to bring development to their respective\r\ncountries. In order to succeed, they must choose the\r\npath that best suits their needs. They must choose the\r\npath that is compatible with present-day realities,\r\ntaking into consideration their history, their culture and\r\ntheir national ethos. There is no single formula that can\r\nbe applied to all countries. It would be wrong for\r\npowerful countries to impose their systems on others. It\r\nwould be wrong for the powerful to mould the\r\ndeveloping countries in their own image.\r\nIn this context, let me once again reiterate that\r\nMyanmar is building a genuine and durable democratic\r\nsystem in its own way. While armed conflicts anywhere\r\nin the world, once started, are difficult to resolve\r\npeacefully, in our country the flames of conflict have\r\nbeen extinguished and the guns silenced. And yet there\r\nare some who would like to stir up the tranquil waters.\r\nThat is when we have to take preventive measures. We\r\nhave to respect the will of the 50 million people who\r\nwould like to preserve the hard-won peace, who do not\r\nwant to see any moves which would lead the nation\r\nback to total anarchy and disintegration.\r\nIn taking such preventive measures, the\r\nGovernment handles the situation in a most humane\r\nmanner. We do no harm to anyone. We do not commit\r\nany atrocities.\r\nThe Government is taking a constructive path,\r\nwhile opposing forces are embarking on a path of\r\ndestruction. Confrontational and destructive actions\r\n44\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\ncan only impede the process of democratization of our\r\ncountry, let alone the achievement of that process.\r\nThe world is now experiencing another\r\ntechnological revolution  the information technology\r\nrevolution. The industrial revolution has resulted in the\r\ncolonization of the peoples of the developing countries.\r\nWe must make doubly sure that the information\r\ntechnology revolution does not bring along with it a\r\nnew form of colonialism. This revolution has the\r\npotential to benefit all mankind. We must also make\r\ndoubly sure that the fruits of the new revolution are\r\navailable worldwide.\r\nWith the advent of globalization, many new\r\nopportunities have been opened to us. At the same\r\ntime, there is a very real possibility that globalization\r\nwill result in the rich becoming richer and the poor\r\nbecoming even more impoverished. At the dawn of the\r\nnew century, it is imperative that we make every effort\r\nto eliminate these disparities. In this respect, we\r\nrightfully look to the United Nations to play a leading\r\nrole.\r\nIn all this the role of the United Nations is of\r\nparamount importance. We must reform the\r\nOrganization so that it will be equal to the task. While\r\nchanges should be introduced to it, there are cardinal\r\nprinciples of the Organization and its Charter which are\r\nsacrosanct. The principles of sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity, sovereign equality and non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs are cardinal principles which have\r\nenabled the world community to live in peace.\r\nTherefore, I totally disagree with those who contend\r\nthat these principles are outdated and that we do not\r\nneed them in the new century. They are as valid in the\r\nnew century as they were in the old.\r\nIt is our hope that this Summit will once again\r\nreaffirm the cardinal principles of international\r\nconduct. These principles served us well in the old\r\nmillennium. They will serve us equally well in the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Dato Seri Syed Hamid Albar,\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Albar (Malaysia): We are gathered here to\r\nreaffirm our faith in the United Nations, which has\r\nserved the international community for over half a\r\ncentury. It is indeed a critical and soul-searching\r\nmoment for members of this Organization. We need to\r\nreflect on the past, draw lessons from it and see how\r\nthe Organization can best serve the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Organization must continue to ensure\r\nfreedom and equality and the right of humankind to\r\nlive in dignity  free from hunger, poverty, violence,\r\noppression and injustice. It must continue to be on the\r\nvanguard of global efforts towards the emancipation of\r\nall of humankind from these ills. It must also continue,\r\nthrough its development programmes and activities, to\r\nbe an important vehicle and catalyst for the\r\ntransformation of societies in the developing world.\r\nThe United Nations must be a more democratic\r\nbody. It cannot champion democracy and good\r\ngovernance in the domestic politics of its members\r\nwhile ignoring these very same principles in its own\r\noperation. Reform is imperative for an Organization\r\nthat was fashioned more than half a century ago in the\r\nprevailing circumstances of the 1940s. Its future\r\nviability and relevance to the contemporary world will\r\ndepend on how successfully it modernizes itself.\r\nFor the United Nations to be relevant with the\r\ntimes and in tune with new realities, it must serve its\r\nmembership in its entirety. The state of the world today\r\nis vastly different from that of the 1940s. Unless the\r\nUnited Nations discards its mindset of the past, it will\r\nbe allowing itself to be a hostage to a bygone era.\r\nThe vast majority of the Members of the United\r\nNations today are developing countries  many of\r\nthem small and vulnerable. They look to the\r\nOrganization  as the repository of their hopes and\r\naspirations for a better and more equitable world order\r\nbased on the principles of shared responsibility,\r\ncommitments and obligations  as an important forum\r\nfor the articulation of their views, but they also expect\r\nit to be responsive to their concerns and needs. The\r\nsmaller Member States, especially those in the least-\r\ndeveloped category, should not feel that they are being\r\nsidelined but that they can expect to participate in\r\ndiscussions on global issues and make a meaningful\r\ncontribution.\r\nConsequently, any meaningful reform of the\r\nOrganization must place the interests of the majority of\r\nits Members at the core of such an exercise. There is\r\nalso a need to reform the other organs of the United\r\nNations, particularly the Security Council, the body\r\ncharged with the maintenance of international peace\r\n45\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nand security. It remains an anachronistic institution,\r\nreflecting the realities and power equations of the\r\nimmediate post-Second-World-War period rather than\r\nthose of the contemporary world we live in. The\r\nCouncil should be enlarged and restructured to reflect\r\nthe new realities and be made more democratic, both in\r\nits structure and its decision-making process. The\r\nOrganization cannot be said to have made the transition\r\nto the twenty-first century if the Security Council\r\nremains set in its old ways and procedures.\r\nThe United Nations must face current challenges\r\neven as it must continue to address the issues of the\r\npast century. These include, inter alia, the still-\r\nunresolved issue of peace in the Middle East,\r\nparticularly Palestine; weapons of mass destruction;\r\nand inter-State territorial disputes around the globe. It\r\nhas to come to grips with the increasing phenomenon\r\nof intra-State conflicts revolving around inter-ethnic\r\nrivalries, discrimination, religious intolerance or\r\nextremism.\r\nThe United Nations cannot but be compelled to\r\nplay the leading role in the process of globalization\r\nwhich has overwhelmed much of the world. Clearly,\r\nglobalization is here to stay. It will have a tremendous\r\nimpact on human affairs and on the process of\r\nachieving global peace, security and development, and\r\nthe enjoyment of human rights.\r\nFor many developing countries, unfortunately,\r\nglobalization offers more challenges than\r\nopportunities. Greater globalization means increased\r\nvulnerability to unfamiliar and unpredictable forces\r\nthat bring economic instability, financial upheaval and\r\nsocial dislocation, sometimes with lightning speed. To\r\nprotect emerging economies from the negative effects\r\nof speculative capital flows, Malaysia has continuously\r\ncalled for an urgent review and reform of the current\r\ninternational financial architecture. Such reform is\r\nimperative if we are to ensure a well-functioning global\r\neconomy that will reap the full benefits of the\r\nglobalization process.\r\nThere is also a need for greater international\r\ncooperation to deal with the risks and challenges of the\r\nnew and dynamic international environment, requiring\r\nmeasures and approaches that are sensitive to the\r\nparticular needs of Member States.\r\nMalaysia believes that the views of developing\r\ncountries and their right to special and differential\r\ntreatment must be taken into account in any\r\nmultilateral negotiations. In this regard the United\r\nNations has an important, legitimate and constructive\r\nrole to play given its universal membership and moral\r\nweight on global issues. We commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for initiating dialogue and interactions with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions. We hope this will be\r\nfurther developed as an integral mechanism in the\r\nOrganizations efforts to influence the deliberations of\r\nimportant international institutions, including those of\r\nthe World Trade Organization.\r\nThe United Nations has an enormous task ahead\r\nin the twenty-first century. Let us all work together in a\r\ntrue spirit of mutual understanding and full cooperation\r\nto achieve our goals.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Amre Moussa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nEgypt.\r\nMr. Moussa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It is my\r\nhonour to convey the greetings of President Hosni\r\nMubarak, along with his apologies for being unable to\r\nparticipate in this meeting. At the same time, I wish to\r\nconvey to the Assembly his views and his thoughts as\r\nPresident of Egypt.\r\nWe are at a historic juncture. The world is\r\nemerging from an old era which lasted for 20 centuries\r\ninto a new era that begins with the twenty-first century.\r\nThis new era is marked by an unprecedented,\r\ncomprehensive global outlook, by scientific advances\r\nand breakthroughs that no one could have anticipated,\r\nand by the laying of foundations for an interdependent\r\ninternational community whose societies and\r\nindividuals interact on the basis of transparency, ample\r\navailability of information and respect for the rights of\r\nthe individual and of the community. All of this renews\r\nour hope for a future in which we can realize our\r\naspirations and fulfil the dreams that mankind has\r\nalways expressed through literature, poetry and visions.\r\nThe horizon of the future is vast, and so are the\r\ngreat, serious challenges confronting us. Our duty at\r\nthis historic juncture is to establish jointly the\r\nintellectual basis for dealing with the new century, with\r\nits potential and its hopes, manifested in the\r\ninformation revolution and in the scientific advances\r\nand the achievements of modern technology.\r\nIn the few minutes allotted to us, Egypt would\r\nlike to focus on some of what it sees as essential to\r\n46\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nuniversal dialogue. With reference to our hopes and\r\naspirations: those that have been achieved should not\r\nconceal the fact that most of the world continues to\r\nsuffer from poverty, ignorance and disease. It still\r\nconfronts the problems and dangers of debt, war,\r\nterrorism, illicit drugs, deteriorating environments,\r\nracial discrimination, religious intolerance, intellectual\r\nextremism and a host of diseases of our modern age.\r\nProminent among these is the growing, seemingly\r\nunstoppable desire for hegemony and domination, and\r\nthe desire to exercise the arrogance of power and to\r\nignore democratic principles in international relations.\r\nAll of this creates tension in the world.\r\nAdvances in intellectual pursuits, expansion of\r\navailable information and the opening of channels for\r\nthe free circulation of information must not mean the\r\npromotion of a culture of defiance and conflict with\r\nother cultures, with one culture unwilling to coexist\r\nwith other cultures. Some cultures with a deeply rooted\r\nheritage and well established resources persist in\r\nrejecting dialogue and interaction. It is as if we were\r\nbeing forced to choose between the hegemony of the\r\nvalues of a specific culture, which we are all obliged to\r\nacknowledge, and a desperate struggle for survival.\r\nThere is plenty of room for coexistence and\r\nharmony among cultures and civilizations; we should\r\naffirm this so that we can build a new life.\r\nEgypt cannot imagine the establishment of a new,\r\nstable international order without dialogue among all\r\nas a joint endeavour, and without a sharing of\r\nresponsibility for the building of that edifice. In that\r\nconnection, Egypt calls for a broad, extensive debate in\r\nthe framework of the General Assembly, which is a\r\nuniversal parliament, to draw up an international\r\ncontract with the participation of representatives of\r\nvarious legislative bodies and civil societies. In\r\nspeaking of a new international order I am referring not\r\nonly to issues pertaining to decision-making on matters\r\nof international peace and security, finance, economics\r\nand trade; I refer also to issues relating to women,\r\nchildren, population, economic and social\r\ndevelopment, health, disease, the environment and\r\nother problems of which we have spoken in the past.\r\nWe reaffirm the importance of narrowing the\r\ndigital divide so that everyone can benefit from the\r\nrevolution in communication and information\r\ntechnology.\r\nEgypt calls for enhancing the role and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security in the face of the\r\nnew, changing threats that have emerged over the past\r\ndecade. We also stress the importance of establishing a\r\nstable collective-security system. Disarmament issues\r\nrelated to such a regime include eliminating weapons\r\nof mass destruction, nuclear disarmament and\r\npromoting a more effective role for peacemaking and\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nWe also stress the importance of completing the\r\ndebate on restructuring the Security Council so that we\r\ncan strike a fair deal that will make it possible to\r\nincrease the number of its permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats, taking into account the need for the\r\noverwhelming majority  the developing countries \r\nto exercise their rights and responsibilities regarding\r\nrepresentation and to serve as active members of the\r\ninternational community. Equal importance must be\r\ngiven to reform of the Councils working methods\r\nthrough increased transparency and democracy in\r\ndecision-making, and especially to reconsidering the\r\nuse of the veto. In that connection, the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security must be reaffirmed.\r\nLast but not least, I want to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General on the valuable report he submitted\r\nto the Millennium Summit; I call for a discussion of the\r\nideas set out in that report in universities and other\r\nacademic and research centres and intellectual forums.\r\nThere should be comprehensive discussion of the\r\nreport in the General Assembly, so that we can jointly\r\naddress the major international issues it raises. It is\r\nhere in this Hall that we should formulate and launch a\r\nplan of action to deal with those problems.\r\nI wish also to stress the importance we attach to\r\nthe recommendations set out in the Brahimi report on\r\nUnited Nations peace operations. The General\r\nAssembly must be prepared to discuss these\r\nrecommendations seriously.\r\nEgypt has been following the work of the\r\nMillennium Forum for non-governmental\r\norganizations, and we welcome its final document,\r\nwhich contains a plan of action stressing the\r\nimportance of respect for national sovereignty and for\r\nthe right of peoples to self-determination. It also calls\r\nfor nuclear disarmament, an end to economic sanctions\r\nand addressing the negative impact of globalization.\r\n47\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nEgypt comes to this high-level gathering bearing\r\nthe troubles of its region. I take this opportunity to\r\nvoice our aspirations with respect to bringing about\r\npeace and development in Africa, a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East,\r\nand the establishment of a Palestinian State, that would\r\ncrown the peace process that Egypt initiated more than\r\n20 years ago. It is high time for that peace process to\r\nattain its final goals in a manner that will open up the\r\nhorizons of a better future as we begin a new century\r\nand a new millennium.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Batyr Berdyev, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nTurkmenistan.\r\nMr. Berdyev (Turkmenistan): It is a great honour\r\nfor me to speak from the rostrum of this historic\r\nMillennium Summit of the General Assembly. First of\r\nall, allow me to convey words of greeting from\r\nMr. Saparmurat Niyazov, President of Turkmenistan.\r\nOn the eve of the Summit, we distributed a document\r\ncontaining an article by the President of Turkmenistan\r\nrelating to the inauguration of the Summit, entitled\r\nThe Turkmens, Turkmenistan and the world millennia\r\nand the twenty-first century, the bond of time and\r\ncivilizations. That document highlights our\r\nphilosophy and strategy for the development of a\r\nneutral and independent Turkmenistan, its involvement\r\nin the system of global relationships and its vision of\r\nthe role and place of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. I would like to draw attention to some of\r\nthe elements contained in this document.\r\nGlobalization is one of the main trends of modern\r\ntimes; however, despite its objective and generally\r\nprogressive nature, we cannot ignore the potential\r\nthreat of social upheavals and attempts to homogenize\r\npolitical systems and to reduce the historically\r\nestablished diversity of world views and systems of\r\ncultural values to only one political philosophy that\r\nleaves no other alternative open. At the same time, we\r\nshare the view that in the twenty-first century, facing\r\nnew challenges, the United Nations system needs to be\r\nradically reformed. We support a United Nations\r\nreform aimed at strengthening and expanding the\r\nOrganizations role in the world. We are against the\r\ndissolution of the United Nations into some new\r\nsupranational structures. We are against any attempts\r\nby individual States or groups of States to usurp United\r\nNations functions.\r\nThis applies fully in the case of such a serious\r\nproblem as that of Afghanistan. It is our firm belief,\r\nand facts from the history of the long-suffering Afghan\r\npeople most vividly demonstrate, that any outside\r\ninterference in the Afghan conflict is doomed to\r\nfailure. Dividing the Afghan people into bad and\r\ngood brings only a new cycle of bloodshed. The\r\nUnited Nations should have complete confidence that\r\nTurkmenistan is a reliable partner, prepared to actively\r\ncontribute to an Afghan settlement.\r\nAs regards ensuring stable social development\r\nand progress, regional cooperation is of special\r\nsignificance in todays world. At present our region is\r\nwitnessing the formation of a stable system of active\r\ninteraction under the aegis of the Organisation for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, which\r\nmaintains partnership relations with the United\r\nNations, the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\nand other international institutions.\r\nThe efforts undertaken by Turkmenistan to export\r\nits energy resources to international markets serve the\r\ngoals of development to no lesser extent. We are\r\nconvinced that the contours of Eurasian security run\r\nalong the routes of the future pipelines. In this sense,\r\nthe construction of pipelines means not only profitable\r\ncommercial projects, it also means the implementation\r\nof large-scale social development projects that go far\r\nbeyond national boundaries.\r\nAs regards strengthening regional cooperation in\r\nAsia, it is highly important to ensure that the United\r\nNations undertakes monitoring of the situation with\r\nregard to the establishment of a new legal status for the\r\nCaspian Sea. This new status should be determined by\r\ntaking into account the interests of all the littoral\r\nStates. Today the process of establishing a new\r\ninternational legal status for the Caspian Sea faces\r\ncertain difficulties that could potentially have a rather\r\nundesirable influence on regional stability. Under these\r\nconditions, active involvement by the United Nations is\r\nconsidered to be very relevant.\r\nTurkmenistan promotes respect, tolerance and\r\nhumane attitudes in international relations and follows\r\nthe same principles in its national life. In December\r\n1999 the law on the complete and final abolition of\r\ncapital punishment in Turkmenistan was adopted. This\r\nwas the first such humanistic legislation in Asia.\r\nTurkmenistan acceded to the Second Optional Protocol\r\nto the International Covenant on Civil and Political\r\n48\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nRights, which reaffirmed our intention to implement\r\npractically the principles of humanism, democracy and\r\nthe protection of human freedoms and rights. However,\r\nin doing so we, as realistic and pragmatic people,\r\nbelieve that social development is an ongoing process\r\nthat requires cooperation, the exchange of ideas and,\r\nabove all, dialogue with the United Nations.\r\nThe interconnection and interdependence of the\r\nprocesses under way in todays world are evident.\r\nTheir dialectics are built along the following line:\r\nhuman being  State  region  continent  whole\r\nworld  humankind. Therefore, we believe that by\r\nunderstanding its entire responsibility any State and\r\nany nation  be it large or small  is capable today of\r\ninfluencing the entire course of world development\r\nprecisely in accordance with this sequence. In line with\r\nthis, international cooperation and dialogue among\r\ncivilizations have to be free from any political dictates\r\nor preconditions. This is the approach on which\r\nTurkmenistan has always insisted and insists. This is an\r\napproach that corresponds to the moral criteria of the\r\nTurkmen people and their political philosophy.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Marcel Metefara, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nfor la Francophonie of the Central African Republic.\r\nMr. Metefara (Central African Republic) (spoke\r\nin French): Allow me first of all, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation I am heading, to congratulate you warmly,\r\nSir, on the initiative you have taken in holding this\r\nSummit, which is of such importance at the beginning\r\nof this new century.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has said, the\r\nMillennium Summit provides an opportunity to take\r\nstock and to consider the role the Organization will be\r\ncalled upon to play in the twenty-first century. The\r\nUnited Nations is indeed the ideal structure where all\r\nthe energies of the planet should be united so as to\r\nconfront the new challenges. This is why it is\r\nimperative for all of us to reform the United Nations to\r\nadapt it to the new demands of the third millennium.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to warmly\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General of our Organization\r\nand the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for\r\nthe serious manner in which they are preparing the\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, to be held in May 2001 in\r\nBrussels. For its part, the Central African Republic is\r\nactively participating in the preparations for that\r\nimportant gathering, and we attach the greatest\r\nimportance to it. We hope that, at this threshold of the\r\nmillennium, the outcome will be commensurate with\r\nthe concerns, which have to do essentially with\r\ncombating poverty.\r\nI cannot conclude without thanking the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations\r\nsystem for the actions taken to consolidate peace and\r\npromote democracy in the Central African Republic.\r\nMay this Millennium Summit herald a new age of\r\neffective cooperation for progress and peace for the\r\nwhole international community.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Anund Priyay Neewoor, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Mauritius.\r\nMr. Neewoor (Mauritius): I have the honour and\r\nprivilege to address the Summit on behalf of the Prime\r\nMinister of Mauritius, who is unable to join the\r\nAssembly personally today, due to general elections in\r\nMauritius, which are to take place on 11 September.\r\nOn behalf of our delegation, I extend to the Co-\r\nChairpersons our very warm congratulations on their\r\nelection to preside over this historic Summit, which is\r\nbeing held at the dawn of the new century and of a new\r\nmillennium to reflect on the future role of the United\r\nNations in bringing about a better tomorrow for all\r\nmankind.\r\nI take this opportunity to express our deep\r\ngratitude to the President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-fourth session, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for their\r\nleadership, vision and tireless work over many months\r\nin preparation for this extraordinary event.\r\nWe are all aware that the world order we have\r\ntoday is rapidly falling out of tune with the realities of\r\nour times and that there is a pressing need for the\r\ninternational community to come together and address\r\nthe numerous challenges before us. These challenges\r\nhave been comprehensively brought out in the inspiring\r\ndocument entitled We the peoples, prepared and\r\ncirculated by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nwhom we highly compliment for the excellent and\r\nthought-provoking work he has produced.\r\n49\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nWe remain faced today with many old issues,\r\nsuch as poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy, to name\r\nonly a few, which continue to afflict vast populations\r\nacross the world. While large-scale wars have been\r\naverted under the existing world order, which is based\r\nlargely on the Charter of the United Nations, low-level\r\nconflicts continue to occur, affecting the lives of\r\nmillions of people, including women and children in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, particularly in Africa. The\r\nspectre of nuclear holocaust continues to haunt\r\nhumanity in the absence of the determination of the\r\nnuclear Powers to reach agreement for the total\r\nelimination, albeit in a phased manner, of their nuclear\r\narsenals.\r\nWe must acknowledge that the present world\r\norder has proved to be glaringly inadequate in the\r\nefforts of the international community to address the\r\nold issues, let alone the new ones, arising from the\r\nglobalization of the world economy, the rapid growth\r\nof information technology and the resulting digital\r\ndivide, the consequences of the environmental\r\ndegradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS, gender issues\r\nand many more.\r\nMost regrettable is that the gap between the haves\r\nand the have-nots is enlarging dramatically rather than\r\nnarrowing down. A large number of countries, reeling\r\nunder the debt burden and with ever-dwindling foreign\r\ndevelopment assistance, cannot provide even the basic\r\nnecessities of life to their peoples, such as satisfactory\r\nnutrition, safe drinking water, health care, proper\r\nshelter and, to children, their right to universal basic\r\neducation. And these are among the countries that are\r\nstriving to establish and consolidate democratic values,\r\ngood governance and adherence to principles of human\r\nrights.\r\nMoreover, they are endeavouring in difficult\r\nconditions to restructure their poor economies to meet\r\nthe exigencies of globalization. The small island\r\ndeveloping States are particularly confronted with\r\nunprecedented anxieties in the process of globalization\r\ndue to their lack of capacity to meet the new challenges\r\nwithout any special dispensation for them in the\r\nemerging global economic and trade environment.\r\nFrom Seattle to Washington, D.C., from Davos to\r\nLondon, and in many other places, people have spoken\r\nand have signalled in no uncertain terms that the\r\npresent world order, particularly in economic, trade and\r\ndevelopment areas, is unsatisfactory and needs to be\r\nreformed and made more equitable and just for the\r\nbenefit of humanity at large. What the people say in the\r\nstreets now the developing countries have been saying\r\nfor many years in various international forums, with\r\nlittle success.\r\nWe are aware that the United Nations cannot\r\nprovide all the remedies for the ailments of the existing\r\nworld order. The economic and trade issues fall within\r\nthe purview of other relevant international institutions\r\nsuch as the International Monetary Fund, the World\r\nBank and the World Trade Organization, and these\r\norganizations must address them seriously and\r\ncomprehensively.\r\nBut the United Nations can and must do more in\r\nthe future within the mandate of its Charter to promote\r\nfaster economic and social, as well as personal, human\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnans paper We the peoples constitutes, in our\r\nview, an important blueprint for the future work of the\r\nUnited Nations, provided that necessary financial\r\nresources are made available for that purpose.\r\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations wrote\r\nits Charter in the context of an emerging and far less\r\ncomplex world order in the aftermath of the Second\r\nWorld War. In the 55 years since, the world has been\r\ntransformed so much that today we call it a global\r\nvillage. All the 189 Member States representing the\r\nworld community recognize that it is time to reform the\r\nUnited Nations Charter so that it better reflects the\r\nrealities and dynamism of the world of today. In\r\nparticular, reform of the Security Council  the\r\ndecision-making organ of the United Nations for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security  is long overdue,\r\nas in its present form it can hardly be regarded as a\r\ndemocratic body representative of the collective\r\nmembership of the United Nations. We need to rise\r\nabove national interests that have so far prevented the\r\nurgently required reforms from being achieved and\r\nexpeditiously bring to a positive conclusion our long-\r\ndrawn-out deliberations on this subject.\r\nThe United Nations is the only fully\r\nrepresentative intergovernmental organization we have,\r\nwith a comprehensive mandate to address almost all\r\nglobal issues. It represents the collective aspirations of\r\nall mankind for a peaceful, stable and prosperous world\r\ncommunity. In the fulfilment of its noble objectives, it\r\nmust be supported fully and unreservedly by all of us.\r\n50\r\nA/55/PV.5\r\nMauritius fully endorses the Millennium Summit\r\nDeclaration, which sets a minimum but important\r\nagenda to be pursued by the world community together\r\nto ensure the well-being of humanity as a whole as we\r\nprogress into the twenty-first century.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.40 p.m.\r\n"
