This is yet another manifestation of\r\nthe freedom that we have gained.\r\nI cannot fail to acknowledge the comprehensive\r\nnature of the report of the Secretary-General. This is,\r\nindeed, a document worthy of a millennium. Today, I\r\nwant to share with the Assembly some reflections, and\r\nsome of the burdens in my heart. As members know, I\r\nparticipated in bringing the cold war — the longest war\r\nin history — to an end, and I am proud of that.\r\nEveryone here remembers a world that was split in\r\ntwo — a world of East and West, a world separated by\r\nthe wall whose building blocks were those of class and\r\nideological differences, a world in which the spectre of\r\npossible nuclear war was a constant threat.\r\nMy co-thinkers and I were convinced that once\r\nthe cold war was over, expressions of anxiety about the\r\nend of humankind would end. This was a unique\r\nphenomenon: a world war ending without bloodshed.\r\nHowever, I cannot mask a certain disappointment\r\nresulting from today’s realities.\r\nThe unsettled conflicts of today — both between\r\nand within States — could flare up into horrific\r\nconflagrations tomorrow. Figures on people suffering\r\nfrom hunger, tragic infirmities and illiteracy simply\r\nboggle the mind. Against the backdrop of such global\r\nshifts, my country has chosen to take a course towards\r\ndemocratic development. But what has come out of it?\r\nA handful of separatists relying on external forces split\r\nGeorgia asunder, exterminating thousands of innocent\r\npeople in the process. For eight consecutive years,\r\n300,000 of my compatriots have remained ousted from\r\ntheir homes. More than half of the population is on the\r\nverge of hunger, although friends from the United\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nStates and other countries are helping. Again, I thank\r\nthese friends for that.\r\nThe United Nations Security Council has adopted\r\n23 resolutions on the Abkhaz conflict. And the result?\r\nNothing. The Security Council has so far been unable\r\neven to call the ethnically based expulsion of people\r\nfrom Abkhazia by its appropriate name.\r\nAs the cold war came to a close, we spoke a great\r\ndeal about a new world and a new order. Ten years\r\nhave passed. The world order we all dreamed of is still\r\nin the distance. I, an optimist by nature, personally\r\nhave grounds for skepticism. Earlier, we spoke of the\r\nbipolar world. Some suggest a multipolar world today.\r\nWho, then, will be able to assume responsibility for\r\nmatters that cannot be shouldered by individual,\r\nsovereign States?\r\nAgain, I thank President Clinton and other leaders\r\nfor the initiatives they have taken in this area. It is\r\ncommonly known that as debts accumulate, the number\r\nof those suffering from hunger and sickness the world\r\nover is multiplying. This is not a populist appeal: at the\r\ndawn of this millennium, we must release poor and\r\ndeveloping countries from the fetters of debt.\r\nMany new, independent democratic States are\r\nnow facing difficulties. In Georgia, for example, we\r\nhave established democratic values and gained freedom\r\nfor the nation and the individual. Yet we have not even\r\ncome near to achieving a state of well-being for our\r\npeople. Neither have corruption nor the shadow\r\neconomy been defeated. This will require time.\r\nIn developing democratic States, a protracted\r\nprocess leading towards material welfare is calling\r\ndemocratic values into question. We cannot expect\r\ndisillusioned people to derive their nourishment from\r\nideals alone. As the Georgian saying goes, to a poor\r\nman misfortunes never come singly. When we had\r\ngained a relatively firm footing, and somewhat\r\nrecovered our breath, environmental problems resulted\r\nin the obliteration of our harvest. Now, too, we are\r\nlooking to our friends with hope. In my view, we can\r\nno longer doubt that the dangers of global warming are\r\nnow upon us. Do we fully understand all that awaits\r\nour planet?\r\nI believe that global environmental security\r\nshould be the direct responsibility of the United\r\nNations and its Security Council. To some degree,\r\nworld food security should also be subject to\r\ncentralized management. The resources and capabilities\r\nof the United Nations must dramatically increase and,\r\nof course, the role and responsibility of individual\r\nStates should likewise grow. All these concerns\r\nindicate that addressing the problems we face in this\r\nmillennium is a task that individual States — even the\r\nmost powerful ones — cannot manage alone. There is a\r\nneed for a uniting and bonding force, a body with\r\nbroad competence and wide duties. There is a need for\r\na fundamental restructuring of the United Nations and\r\nthe Security Council to meet the challenges of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Security Council must be expanded. I recall\r\nthat, at the General Assembly in 1992, I spoke in\r\nfavour of permanent membership for Germany and\r\nJapan. I wonder why the expansion issue has not yet\r\nbeen resolved. More new prospective members have\r\nappeared, and today, too, a reasonable solution can be\r\nfound. I firmly believe that the right of veto must be\r\nlimited. The Charter of the United Nations also needs\r\nto be adapted so as to factor in modern discoveries and\r\nthe worst threats of the new era. The role and functions\r\nof the Security Council must be more clear cut. If I\r\nmay borrow some words from the Secretary-General,\r\nthe Security Council must have at its disposal a\r\nsufficient number of fire engines to put out the flames\r\nand maintain stability and peace in the world.\r\nI concur with the Secretary-General’s position on\r\nthe International Criminal Court. However, we must\r\nensure that it does not take us a whole new decade to\r\nmake it happen. The interaction of such powerful\r\nregional organizations as the European Union and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nwith the United Nations and its Security Council must\r\nbe better coordinated and synchronized.\r\nNo individual State or group of States can resolve\r\nthe problems facing humankind or, most importantly,\r\nsave the human being, nature’s crowning achievement.\r\nAnd yet we must hope that independent\r\ndemocratic States will become stronger and that\r\ntogether we will ultimately create a new United\r\nNations and a new Security Council which will be the\r\ncentral guarantee of peace and security.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Kessai\r\nH. Note, President of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands.\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nPresident Note: I extend warm greetings of\r\n“iokwe” from the people of the Republic of the\r\nMarshall Islands . It is a great and distinct privilege to\r\naddress this historic Millennium Summit of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI wish to commend the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for the comprehensive and\r\noutstanding report on the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe twenty-first century. Directing the course of this\r\nOrganization to meet the international community’s\r\nexpectations for many years to come will certainly\r\ndemand our entire commitment.\r\nI take this opportunity to recognize the\r\ncontribution of the founding fathers and framers of the\r\nUnited Nations and its Charter. The vision, values, and\r\nprinciples espoused in the Charter have guided this\r\nOrganization for well over half a century. The\r\nprinciples of democracy, respect for human rights and\r\nthe right of self-determination of peoples in conformity\r\nwith the principles of justice and international law\r\nshould continue to underpin our collective\r\ndevelopment. I wish to reaffirm the adherence and\r\ncommitment of the Marshall Islands to such principles\r\nfor the collective good of all people.\r\nIt is due to these guiding principles that I\r\nenthusiastically welcome Tuvalu as the 189th Member\r\nState of the United Nations. As a Pacific Island\r\nneighbour, I am proud to be among those\r\ncongratulating the Government and people of Tuvalu.\r\nWhile expansion might provide additional challenges,\r\nthe admission of new Member States adds to the\r\nlegitimacy of the Organization.\r\nThe guiding principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter have continued and will continue to be tested\r\nover the years. Exploitation, in many forms and\r\nvarying degrees, of people, land, the oceans, the\r\natmosphere, and their interactive and interdependent\r\nsystems continue to pose real and immediate threats to\r\nthe very existence of small island developing countries\r\nlike the Marshall Islands. We need to be empowered so\r\nthat technology and globalization can help us, but not\r\nat the expense of the lives and dignity of people and\r\ntheir countries. As it is with other small island\r\ncountries, the Marshall Islands needs to have its feet\r\nrooted on land — on dry land, that is. Global warming\r\nand sea-level rise is threatening our very existence, and\r\nwe call on the minds, the hearts and spirits of the\r\nindividual and full membership of the Organization to\r\nstrengthen all efforts to help us prevail over these\r\nthreats.\r\nThe new order of globalization of economies is a\r\nphenomenon that requires closer consideration and\r\ncoordination of this Organization, so as to create a\r\npositive force for dealing with the many challenges\r\nfacing each individual country and our common\r\nhumanity.\r\nIn the face of past turbulence and upheaval, this\r\nbody has always attempted to fulfil its mission\r\nundaunted and without despair. The very establishment\r\nand adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights in 1948, and its ongoing enforcement, albeit\r\nwith limited means for follow-up, is a monumental\r\naccomplishment in itself. Nurturing the development of\r\npeoples, amidst varying degrees of vulnerabilities, so\r\nthat they become, and continue to be, self-sufficient,\r\nself-sustaining, and equal participating partners in the\r\nadvancement of the world may be a tall order for many\r\nof us and for our Organization, but that is why we are\r\nhere today.\r\nThe role that the United Nations has played, and\r\ncontinues to play, to restore order and normalcy in\r\nvarious parts of the world including the Middle East\r\nand East Asia is to be commended. Its incessant and\r\nactive support of humanitarian concerns, its dedicated\r\nmission against all forms of discrimination relating to\r\nreligion, race, gender, health, education, income,\r\nability and poverty indicates the magnitude of the\r\nresponsibility and the burden that this body carries.\r\nWithout the full support of all, the sustenance and\r\npromotion of these efforts will be difficult.\r\nTo fully reflect the original intention of the\r\nCharter, the United Nations will need to give a closer\r\nlook at its own structures and the principles governing\r\nthe operation of its essential organs. I am encouraged\r\nby discussions on issues relating to the operation of the\r\nSecurity Council on the matter of permanent\r\nmembership, given the continuous emphasis this body\r\nplaces on the unreserved application of democratic\r\nprinciples. The conditions under which the\r\nInternational Court of Justice continues to be restrained\r\nfrom exercising the authority to issue binding decisions\r\nmust be reviewed. How else can any international\r\nsystem of governance enunciate, promulgate, protect\r\nand deliver justice without the necessary force behind\r\nits own pronouncements? The perpetual financial\r\nbackground constraining the work of the United\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nNations requires some bold steps. To continue to\r\nmaintain the status quo and to persist in guarding it as\r\nsacrosanct in the face of new attitudes, perspectives,\r\nexperience and knowledge, is to bat against the\r\nimmutable law of change.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is\r\nencouraged by the growing recognition among leaders\r\nand people from all walks of life of the need for a\r\nuniversal framework for international peace. We aim to\r\ndefeat the impact of world wars, of colonization, and of\r\nnuclear-weapon-test fallout. Despite our\r\nvulnerabilities, we want to be an active partner and\r\nMember of the Organization, its subsidiary bodies and\r\nother international agencies, and help to bring about\r\npeace and prosperity for all States, regardless of size.\r\nWe support the promotion of international frameworks\r\nsuch as the Alliance of Small Island States as we\r\npromote the sustainability of our people and our world.\r\nWhile we recognize the challenge of reducing the\r\nproportion of people suffering from hunger and the\r\nlack of a steady supply of safe water, as well as the\r\nchallenge of the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS, the\r\nscourge of malaria and other major diseases afflicting\r\nhumanity, we must not forget that an educated\r\npopulation leads to a healthy and prosperous society.\r\nI am indeed grateful for the United Nations\r\nforum. Without it, where else could nations voice and\r\naddress freely their individual and universal concerns?\r\nI have enjoyed listening to the rich insights and\r\nthoughts expressed by my fellow world leaders, and I\r\ncertainly look forward to group discussions later, when\r\nleaders will deliberate on specific global issues.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): Before\r\nproceeding to the next speaker on my list, I remind the\r\nAssembly that we have a very long list of speakers. I\r\nappeal to participants to respect as much as possible\r\nthe five-minute speaking time allotted to each speaker.\r\nThat will allow us to hear all the speakers on the list\r\ntoday.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cape Verde.\r\nPresident Monteiro (Cape Verde) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; French text furnished by the delegation):\r\nFirst of all, allow me, Madam Co-Chairperson, to\r\nexpress my satisfaction at knowing that the difficult\r\nand honourable responsibility of guiding our work is in\r\nyour hands. I am sure that your competence and well-\r\nknown dedication will be placed fully at the service of\r\nthe success of this historic Millennium Summit. As a\r\nrepresentative of a small island developing State, I\r\nassure you that my participation in this major event is\r\nmotivated by a feeling of great hope and by well-\r\nfounded confidence.\r\nMy hopes look to the new millennium and to\r\nwhat it will inevitably bring: freedom, development\r\nand well being for mankind as a whole. In other words,\r\nit will be a millennium in which the dignity and worth\r\nof human beings will finally become the ultimate\r\nraison d’être and measure of the success of our\r\ncommon struggle for a world of peace, stability,\r\nprogress and security.\r\nBut I am also speaking of the confidence that\r\ninspires us in the United Nations, and of the\r\nfundamental role the Organization should continue to\r\nplay as a collective instrument, increasingly more\r\nmodern and efficient, but always at the service of our\r\npeoples and bearing in mind the pressing global\r\nchallenges, to which we must respond with solidarity\r\nand shared responsibility.\r\nAmong those challenges, I would like to mention\r\nthe fight against poverty in particular. It is\r\nheartbreaking to see how many human beings\r\nthroughout the planet, and particularly in Africa, face\r\npoverty as the major obstacle to a minimum of dignity\r\nin their lives and to the attainment of their most basic\r\nrights. It is urgent that we end that reality, which is\r\ntragic and is our common responsibility. The task is\r\nobviously a great one that must be put into perspective\r\nin a synergetic framework that brings about the\r\nsolidarity of will and sufficient resources to ensure\r\ncohesion, efficiency and durability in the various\r\npolicies and programmes at the national level.\r\nThe pace of events has accelerated in the last\r\ndecade, accentuating in an unforeseeable way the\r\ndimension and nature of the tragedies we are\r\nexperiencing. Their persistence is testing our\r\nconfidence in ourselves and in our capacity to take on\r\nnew challenges. But let us also recognize that there is\r\nnow a renewal of conscience, a rejection of fatalism\r\nand a growing willingness among people to shape their\r\nown destinies.\r\nWhat is being challenged is our quality as human\r\nbeings and our sense of the balance and justice that\r\nshould prevail throughout this planet, which we must\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\npass on to future generations liberated from unbearable\r\ndisparities and asymmetries. In this connection, the\r\ninternational community as a whole, and the most\r\nadvanced States in particular, must illustrate their\r\ncapacity for solidarity. I am speaking in particular of\r\nincreasing official development assistance and making\r\na firm commitment to measures to eliminate the debt\r\nburden. That burden undeniably contributes to\r\nsuffocating the meagre resources of many of our\r\ncountries and seriously limiting their development\r\npolicies.\r\nThe guiding values of the United Nations confer\r\nresponsibility upon the Organization to mobilize all\r\nthose who influence the success of the common fate of\r\nmankind. Nevertheless, it is just — and never\r\nunwarranted — to single out the specific cases of least\r\ndeveloped countries and small island developing\r\nStates, whose particular features justify special and\r\ndifferential treatment. Again, this is largely the\r\nsituation on the African continent.\r\nThere is no doubt that the task in Africa is\r\nenormous, in the light of the facts, such as the harmful\r\neffects of diseases such as AIDS and malaria, and of\r\narmed conflicts, with their devastating consequences\r\ninternally and regionally, as well as incipient access to\r\ninternational markets and the acquisition of\r\ntechnological progress and the benefits of a globalized\r\nworld.\r\nIn any case, we are witness to an African\r\nrecovery that cannot be confirmed historically,\r\nhowever, unless Africa is recognized, without any\r\nunjustified delay, as a priority on the international\r\nagenda. It is important not to lose sight of the fact that\r\nprogress and stability on the African continent will\r\nmake an important contribution to global stability and\r\nsecurity, an essential contribution to a balanced, just\r\nand humane world that we all hope to build in this new\r\ncentury under the auspices of the United Nations.\r\n The Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Miguel\r\ndos Anjos da Cunha Lisboa Trovoada, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.\r\n President Trovoada (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nFrench text furnished by the delegation): It is a great\r\nhonour and signal privilege for me to take part in this\r\nmost important Millennium Summit, which has brought\r\ntogether such a significant number of the highest-\r\nranking and most remarkable leaders of our planet.\r\nThis Summit is being held at a timely moment, at\r\nwhich the international community is facing serious\r\nchallenges arising from the imbalances in the levels of\r\ndevelopment of Member States. While it is true that\r\nscientific and technological advances over the centuries\r\nhave allowed spectacular progress to be made in the\r\nmaterial sphere, it is nonetheless equally true that these\r\nsame advances have led to no substantial improvement\r\nin the deeper nature of mankind, which is marked by a\r\nselfishness that continues to be the driving force of all\r\nits actions in defence of personal, group or state\r\ninterests. As a result, a somber and regrettable picture\r\nhas emerged of serious divisions among humanity in\r\nthe early twenty-first century — divisions between\r\ncitizens within a country and among nations in their\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThese relations are dominated by stark injustice,\r\nthe consequences of which include the exacerbation of\r\npoverty among the poorest of the poor; the recurrent\r\nand insoluble issue of external debt; disease; famine;\r\nignorance; unemployment; violations of human rights\r\nand of the rights of the child; the aggravation of\r\nviolence and crime; and war and all its resulting\r\nhorrors — in short, the human tragedy, which has\r\nbecome the banal norm of everyday life for a great\r\nportion of mankind in the face of the indifference or\r\ninactivity of another part of the same species.\r\nThe problems all seem to have been duly\r\ndiagnosed and their causes identified. The material,\r\ntechnical, financial and human resources to address\r\nthem do exist. From our humble perspective, what is\r\nlacking is the firm and determined political will of the\r\nentire international community to act in harmony with\r\na view to stemming the deterioration of the situation,\r\nwhich is degrading and humiliating for those whose\r\nsuffer its consequences and ultimately unworthy of\r\nthose who are in a position to contribute to its\r\neradication but do little or nothing.\r\nIt is clear that a more proactive attitude can\r\nevolve only out of the deep conviction that we are all\r\npart of the same human condition. Only this conviction\r\nand awareness can positively, dynamically and\r\nlastingly forge the interactive links of solidarity that\r\nwill ensure the success of the great and noble aims of\r\nfreedom, progress, justice and peace for all.\r\nAlthough States have inalienable responsibilities\r\nin this area, we are convinced that the United Nations\r\nhas an important role to play. It seems to us, however,\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nthat our Organization, which was created over 50 years\r\nago, must undergo some restructuring, particularly to\r\nrestore a balance that would bring it more in line with\r\nthe geopolitical changes that have taken place since its\r\nbirth.\r\nWe also believe that its universal vocation should\r\nnot be undermined by considerations that ensure that\r\ncountries with several million inhabitants and\r\nrecognized as independent by States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, with which they have relations of\r\nsovereignty, are relegated to the margins of the\r\nOrganization, even though they participate jointly and\r\nactively through international cooperation in the\r\ndevelopment efforts of other peoples. I am speaking\r\nspecifically of the Republic of China on Taiwan. We\r\nare in favour of the free participation of peoples and\r\nthe States that represent them internationally, just as we\r\ndefend the free and democratic participation of citizens\r\nin national life, without discrimination or exclusion.\r\nWar is one of the scourges that cause the greatest\r\ndamage in Africa, preventing the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of its peoples. Some African countries,\r\nindebted and with populations living in extreme\r\npoverty, have been at permanent war for decades. In\r\ntheir struggles, these same States use modern and\r\nsophisticated weapons which they do not produce\r\nthemselves. In the name of minimal moral norms of\r\nbehaviour, which should never be absent from domestic\r\nor international policy, it is urgent that action be\r\nundertaken to ensure effective control of the\r\nproduction, sale and distribution of all categories of\r\nweapons so as to prevent the belligerents from\r\nacquiring them at great cost, to the detriment of their\r\nreconstruction and development programmes.\r\nWe know from experience that, without\r\ndevelopment, democracy is very fragile. We are\r\ntherefore participating in the Summit, convinced that\r\nits outcome will contribute to hastening economic\r\ngrowth, minimizing poverty and strengthening\r\ndemocracy in developing countries. We would express\r\nthe hope that solidarity among states and peoples will\r\ngain in strength and that the spirit of equity and justice\r\nwill henceforth prevail in relations among nations.\r\nThus will the most fragile nations be able to cherish the\r\nhope that they will no longer be marginalized or\r\nsacrificed on the altar of economic and universal\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ismail\r\nOmar Guelleh, President and Head of Government of\r\nthe Republic of Djibouti.\r\nPresident Guelleh (spoke in French): On this\r\nhistoric occasion, at which the United Nations\r\ncommunity is meeting to celebrate the coming of the\r\nnew millennium, I wish to bring this message of peace\r\nand friendship from the people of Djibouti.\r\nBefore all else, I would like to pay deep tribute to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for organizing this\r\nhistoric gathering. The report he has put before us\r\ngives us a broad range of ideas and proposals.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, the rise of\r\nglobalization and the explosion of the information age,\r\nthe decade of the 1990s was of great importance to\r\nhumankind. Fortunately, the dawn of the new\r\nmillennium gives us the opportunity to review and\r\nrevise our programmes and reset our priorities. For the\r\npurposes of this Summit, the critical problems faced by\r\nhumankind have been divided into four categories:\r\npeace and security; development, including the\r\nelimination of poverty; human rights; and the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. As far as we are\r\nconcerned, the problem that appears to be the most\r\nurgent is that of development and the elimination of\r\npoverty.\r\nToday, some 3 billion people — in other words,\r\nalmost half of humanity — suffer from hunger or food\r\nshortages. In a world that produces enough food to\r\nsatisfy the needs of each and every man, woman and\r\nchild, this is absolutely unacceptable. Hunger is the\r\ndaughter of poverty; and for those who are abandoned,\r\nthe despair that it engenders is in many respects the\r\nsource of the four problems that we are addressing at\r\nthis Summit.\r\nThe economic brushfire that is sweeping our\r\nplanet today is known as globalization. It encourages\r\nthe deregulation of markets, free trade and\r\nprivatization. But in many parts of the world,\r\nparticularly in Africa, a number of poor developing\r\ncountries have been trapped in a spiral of\r\nimpoverishment and social disintegration. Since they\r\nare not attractive to private foreign investors, countries\r\nwith low savings levels, and low levels of domestic\r\ninvestment find themselves at a dead end. The\r\ninternational lending organizations, which have\r\ndemanded that these countries tighten their belts still\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nmore in the name of rational economic policies, seem\r\nto have contributed to the deterioration of the crisis.\r\nFurthermore, for the poor countries to be able to\r\nachieve a real recovery and vigorous growth, the\r\nterrible debt burden problem must be resolved.\r\nStructural adjustment suggests a reduction of internal\r\nexpenditure so that these countries can increase their\r\nexports and repay their debts. However, the internal\r\nconstraints, the amount of debt, the degradation of the\r\nterms of trade and restricted access to markets of the\r\ndeveloped countries mean at present, in the digital era,\r\nthat the prospects are hardly encouraging.\r\nTo overcome this situation, the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has\r\nproposed a large increase during this decade in aid to\r\nsub-Saharan Africa, which should be raised to $20\r\nbillion. This aid should contribute greatly to increasing\r\nsavings and domestic investment and might bring about\r\na sustainable growth rate of 6 per cent in the region,\r\nwhich, in turn, would attract foreign investment. Only\r\nthe public financing bodies would be able to give such\r\nimpetus to developing countries. At the present level of\r\n$10 billion per year, official development assistance is\r\nnot playing its role as a catalyst of growth and merely\r\nperpetuates dependence upon aid.\r\nAs the South Centre recently reminded us,\r\nlooking for change and improvement in these areas is\r\nnot synonymous with asking for aid or further\r\nconcessions; it is rather a matter of looking for\r\npolicies, mechanisms and more equitable systems to\r\nstrengthen the development process — and thus, the\r\nentire world economy. It is quite obvious that the main\r\nchallenge with which we have to deal today is to\r\nensure that globalization becomes a positive force for\r\nall peoples of the planet, rich and poor alike. The\r\nresponsibility of managing international economic\r\nproblems, as well as the risks and threats hanging over\r\npeace and security, must be shared by all. The collapse\r\nof the world economy would be the most serious\r\nsystemic threat to world order that one could imagine.\r\nTo avoid this, the world system cannot remain totally\r\nindifferent to the fate of the majority of the peoples on\r\nthis planet.\r\nWe are witnessing the establishment of a new\r\nsystem of international values and a general growth of\r\nawareness, born of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. On the one hand, we have rights that each\r\nindividual should be able to exercise, including\r\nfreedom of expression and conscience, freedom from\r\npoverty and fear and the right to life, liberty and safety\r\nof person, to name but a few. But today we know that\r\nthese rights bring only limited advantages without a\r\nfavourable social environment and at least minimal\r\nmeans of subsistence.\r\nThe main threat hanging over peace and security\r\ntoday is no longer external aggression by States against\r\nother States, but internal violence committed against\r\ncommunities and individuals. It is reaching crisis\r\nproportions throughout the world, but it is completely\r\nout of proportion in Africa, where conflicts, human\r\nrights violations, physical destruction and widespread\r\ndisplacements have anaesthetized the international\r\ncommunity. The unbelievable savagery of certain\r\nconflicts and the unacceptable suffering inflicted have\r\nmade it necessary for us to find new ways of helping\r\npeople who are caught in these crises.\r\nIn this connection, we must activate and make\r\nurgent use of the new International Criminal Court, so\r\nthat criminals who defy the law are brought to justice.\r\nQuite obviously, we have to strengthen considerably\r\nthe peacekeeping capacities of the United Nations and\r\naddress its structural weaknesses. Furthermore, we\r\nmust enlarge the Organization’s sphere of competence\r\nin peacekeeping to include civil administration, as has\r\nbeen the case in Kosovo and East Timor. In order\r\neffectively to deal with certain crises, the United\r\nNations must be able to appeal to its Member States,\r\nwhich can supply well-trained and well-equipped\r\ncontingents that act speedily to open up the way for\r\npeacekeeping forces to enter.\r\nThe elimination of conflicts in all their forms and\r\nthe establishment of peace and security are among the\r\nprincipal tasks awaiting us if we wish to respond to our\r\nmost urgent need, development and the elimination of\r\npoverty. In this respect, the Secretary-General has\r\nplaced before us an enormous challenge: a 50 per cent\r\nreduction in the number of inhabitants of this planet\r\nliving in extreme poverty between now and the year\r\n2015. This represents almost a billion people.\r\nEveryone agrees that this result ought to take\r\nplace in the context of the sacrosanct market economy\r\nthat is sweeping the globe. But the free trade system is\r\nmercilessly cruel. The multilateral institutions must\r\nmaintain order and ensure the application of world\r\nregulations to ensure transparency and democratic\r\nequity. Otherwise, we are likely to succumb to the\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\ntyranny of the market and international chaos. There\r\nmust be a worldwide effort, a collective and\r\ninternational effort, at the centre of which will be the\r\nUnited Nations, representing the peoples and States of\r\nthe world.\r\nWe think that it is in this context that we must\r\naddress the question of strengthening the United\r\nNations. We cannot allow the Organization to become\r\nmore and more marginalized by all the administrative\r\ndevices and procedures being introduced by certain\r\nStates, while they refuse to disburse the funds to which\r\nthe Organization has a legitimate right. Development\r\nwill be limited if it is kept in the hands of the\r\nspecialized agencies, far from the United Nations.\r\nPeace will be uncertain if it is largely in the hands of a\r\nUnited Nations dominated by a Security Council that is\r\nnot representative.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm our faith in\r\nthe future of the United Nations. The fate of our\r\npeoples is closely linked with its future. I am\r\nconvinced that a restructured Organization, made more\r\neffective, will contribute to the coming of an era of\r\npeace and prosperity for all.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Petar\r\nStoyanov, President of the Republic of Bulgaria.\r\nPresident Stoyanov: I hasten to express my\r\ncountry’s support for the growing role and involvement\r\nof the United Nations in promoting and furthering\r\ndemocratic processes worldwide. Here we see a direct\r\nlink with the maintenance and promotion of world\r\npeace and security, which, we believe, will continue to\r\nbe a priority in the future activities of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Republic of Bulgaria is actively involved in\r\nthe international community’s efforts to settle existing\r\nconflicts and secure lasting peace and economic\r\nprosperity throughout the world. That is why we\r\nsupport the need for an effective reform of\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly of the\r\nBulgarian Government’s decision to increase its\r\nfinancial contribution for United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations despite the economic difficulties we are\r\nfacing as a country in transition.\r\nWe gained our peacekeeping experience mainly\r\nduring the Kosovo crisis. The conflict there demarcated\r\na new phase in the development of the world, in which\r\nStates are becoming increasingly interdependent and\r\nState sovereignty is acquiring new forms and content.\r\nMoreover, the crisis  demonstrated that today’s\r\nproblems can be solved only through joint efforts\r\nprompted by shared universal human values rather than\r\nby temporary considerations.\r\nWhile on the subject of Kosovo, let me share my\r\nview that the implementation of a long-term strategy\r\nfor the economic stabilization of the region and its\r\naccelerated integration in European organizations is a\r\nkey factor for the lasting solution of the crisis there and\r\nthe restoration of peace and stability to South-eastern\r\nEurope. The Stability Pact for South-eastern Europe is\r\na decisive instrument in that respect. It is the first-ever\r\nattempt at a post-crisis rehabilitation of a whole region\r\nin the context of globalization. Moreover, the economic\r\nreconstruction of the Balkans and the bid by many non-\r\nEuropean countries to participate in it could be seen as\r\nan attempt to involve the region in the processes of\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe past 10 years have given us sufficient\r\nevidence of the potential of globalization to address\r\ncurrent problems and open up new horizons to\r\nhumankind. This is particularly relevant for the\r\ncountries that were part of the former communist\r\nsystem and are now seeking to carve their niche in this\r\nchanged world.\r\nAt the same time, globalization has confronted us\r\nwith challenges for which we have proved unprepared.\r\nIt has become clear that we cannot opt or not opt for\r\nglobalization: it is a fact that we cannot ignore. What\r\nwe can do is grasp the growing need to manage\r\nglobalization and act accordingly.\r\nIf we are to contain its negative effects, we\r\nshould not allow it to take its course spontaneously, for\r\nit has a tendency to go beyond the economic and\r\ntechnical domain and spill over into the sensitive areas\r\nof culture, national traditions and customs. Here, its\r\nimpact must be studied thoroughly, and ways of\r\ncontrolling it must be sought through new and relevant\r\nlegislation in the area of intellectual property\r\nprotection, including traditional knowledge and\r\nbiodiversity.\r\nBeing convinced of the potential of the new\r\ninformation and communication technologies for\r\nadvancing development, I would like to urge the most\r\ndeveloped countries to facilitate access to the\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\n“information superhighway” for the developing\r\ncountries and the countries in transition. Bridging\r\ntogether the “digital divide” will encourage those\r\ncountries to develop local content on the Internet.\r\nStrengthening the role of the United Nations will\r\nrequire not only the reform, renovation and further\r\neffective institution-building of the world\r\nOrganization, but also its proper adjustment to the new\r\nrealities. I believe that the United Nations will continue\r\nto be a major factor in socio-economic, scientific and\r\ntechnical development, and in environmental protection\r\nand humanitarian cooperation at the national, regional\r\nand global levels. The objectives are clear: achieving\r\nsustainable development, addressing and tackling\r\ndemographic problems, reducing poverty and ensuring\r\nsources of income for all social strata.\r\nThat is why we support the efforts — including\r\nthose of the Secretary-General — to reform and\r\nrestructure the Organization’s socio-economic sector\r\nwith a view to achieving the aforementioned objectives\r\nand creating a regional and global environment that\r\nwould favour more dynamic and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The Republic of Bulgaria has been\r\nmaking its contribution to this end, notably by\r\nparticipating in the work of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and supporting the activities of the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP).\r\nIn closing, I would like to voice our conviction\r\nthat guaranteeing and respecting individuals’ human\r\nrights and basic freedoms is a cornerstone in the\r\ndevelopment of a democratic civil society. Bulgaria is a\r\nparty to all major and universal human rights\r\ninstruments, and we support the initiatives aimed at\r\nstrengthening and increasing the role of United Nations\r\ncontrol mechanisms in the area of human rights.\r\nI hope that the Millennium Summit will set the\r\nstage for the United Nations to be able to successfully\r\nplay its role in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. René\r\nPréval, President of the Republic of Haiti.\r\nPresident Préval (spoke in French): I thank the\r\nSecretary-General for convening this Summit and\r\ncongratulate him on the depth of the report that he has\r\nsubmitted for our consideration.\r\nIn the 55 years of the existence of the United\r\nNations — even though it has sometimes been\r\ndenigrated — the history of the international\r\ncommunity could not have been written without a\r\nconstant reference to the Organization. Even today, in\r\nthe face of a constantly changing global context  with\r\nits impressive array of new challenges, we still deem it\r\nto be a key instrument for shaping the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The proof lies in this special high-level\r\nmeeting, which aims to alleviate concerns about old\r\nand new problems  for which we still do not have a\r\nsolution.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti, a founding Member of this\r\nOrganization, is still, 200 years after winning its\r\npolitical independence, endeavouring to emerge from\r\nunderdevelopment and is to that end seeking to\r\ncontribute to common thinking on ways of honing the\r\nimportant instrument for action that is the United\r\nNations system.\r\nAmong our pressing concerns, certain ones are of\r\nparticular importance to us, because how we respond to\r\nthem will determine the shape of the world to come.\r\nFirst, there is a need to guarantee dignified living\r\nconditions for all human beings. Indeed, we know that\r\nmillions of people are living in abject poverty and\r\nunder the constant threat of social upheaval, whereas,\r\nin the history of mankind, the capacity to create wealth\r\nhas never been as great.\r\nSecondly, we must genuinely democratize the\r\nnew knowledge — and information-based economy.\r\nWe note that there has been a considerable increase in\r\nknow-how and striking technological progress, but so\r\nfar access to it is limited to just a few. This constitutes\r\na new source of inequality and divisions — among and\r\nwithin nations. How then can we put an end to\r\nexclusion and prevent the gap from deepening, until\r\nsuch time as it can be closed? What is the point of\r\nsetting foot on Mars if there is still hunger in several\r\nregions of our planet?\r\nMy third concern is the drift of power from\r\npolitics to finance and the economy. Constant flows of\r\ncapital and international trade tend to diminish nation-\r\nStates and to give rise to supra-national bodies that are\r\nnot elected by the people. By electing only politicians\r\nand not financial representatives, are we not turning\r\ndemocracy into a utopian ideal?\r\nMy fourth concern is the immense, formidable\r\npower of the communication media, which seems to be\r\nin the hands of just a few. Their uncontrolled use of\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nthose media destroys those who oppose them; yet the\r\nmedia could solve a great many problems were they\r\ntruly placed at the service of human advancement.\r\nMy final concern is the pandemics that are\r\ndevastating certain nations, especially the poorest,\r\nthreatening their very survival. The human cost of\r\nthese tragedies is scandalous, especially since the\r\nmeans exist to alleviate them considerably. But\r\nquestions of profitability are often raised here: for\r\nmany, the economic factor completely outweighs\r\nhuman considerations. That being so, how can we\r\naddress these tragedies and place the higher interests of\r\nmankind above mercenary considerations?\r\nThe era of autarky is behind us. States can no\r\nlonger formulate policy without taking account of\r\nregional and global frameworks relating, for instance,\r\nto drugs, terrorist networks, organized crime and\r\npandemics, all of which form part of a global context.\r\nWithout establishing “rules of the game”, and without\r\nsome form of adjudication, globalization will be a\r\njungle.\r\nThat is the mission of international organizations,\r\nled by the United Nations, which can make it possible\r\nto build peace and promote development. We must\r\nconsolidate the authority and legitimacy of the United\r\nNations by democratizing it in order to enhance its\r\neffectiveness and ensure that it can successfully\r\naddress the new challenges of a globalized world.\r\nFor us, the key is to take a dispassionate look at\r\nthe avalanche of past initiatives and at their meagre\r\nresults, and boldly to create a world with an\r\ninternational public-spiritedness, a world in which\r\nsolidarity will prevail over market control.\r\nGlobalization is not new: slavery, colonialism and the\r\ntwo world wars of the twentieth century are evidence\r\nof that. What is frightening today is that globalization\r\ntends to take the form of the privatization of all power.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Robert\r\nKocharian, President of the Republic of Armenia.\r\nPresident Kocharian (spoke in Armenian;\r\ninterpretation furnished by the delegation): The report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the role of the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century (A/54/2000) is\r\nhighly commendable. Armenia shares the views and\r\napproaches reflected in the report with respect to the\r\nchallenges and objectives of our uniquely global\r\nOrganization.\r\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, the scope of\r\nour opportunities — and, at the same time, of our\r\nproblems — has reached a qualitatively new level.\r\nArmenia is confident that the United Nations, given its\r\noutstanding role, has the best potential to address these\r\nnew challenges in the most appropriate manner. The\r\nvast experience of the United Nations throughout the\r\n55 years of its activities is unique. With this in mind,\r\nwe should be more dynamic in adapting United Nations\r\ninstruments and institutions to the new realities.\r\nMaintaining peace and security throughout the\r\nworld will obviously remain a major priority for the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century. The\r\ncontemporary world map continues to be densely\r\nspotted with local conflicts and, as a result, with human\r\nsuffering. The United Nations has been heavily\r\nengaged in conflict resolution in various parts of the\r\nworld. At the same time, Armenia believes that the\r\nexisting potential of the United Nations for the\r\nprevention of new conflicts is not being fully utilized.\r\nIt has become imperative to promote the establishment\r\nof comprehensive early warning mechanisms for\r\npotential conflicts. Wars do not erupt unexpectedly;\r\nthey have their histories and their logic, and can be\r\npredicted.\r\nIn our contemporary world, the notion of security\r\nhas transcended its conventional boundaries.\r\nGlobalization has opened up societies to an\r\nunprecedented degree. As never before, the activities\r\nof individual Governments have become tightly linked\r\nto interdependent and concerted action at the\r\nsubregional, regional and global levels. Integration has\r\nbecome politically and economically expedient. It is\r\napparent that the new environment of coexistence\r\nrequires new approaches in the activities of\r\ninternational organizations. Only collective efforts can\r\nmake it possible for the advantages of globalization\r\neffectively to materialize and for its negative\r\nconsequences to be averted. In other words, the world\r\nof the twenty-first century has acquired all the\r\nprerequisites for genuine stability based on collective\r\naction and responsibility. That is Armenia’s hope.\r\nArmenia is entering the new millennium with the\r\ncelebration next year of the one thousand seven\r\nhundredth anniversary of the adoption of Christianity\r\nas a State religion. Our centuries-old history and our\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nChristian traditions, along with our geographic\r\nlocation, have contributed to our profound\r\nunderstanding of the importance of coexistence and of\r\na dialogue among civilizations.\r\nArmenia belongs to a part of the world that over\r\nthe past 10 years has been subjected to a major political\r\nand social transformation. Having inherited unresolved\r\nproblems from the past, Armenia and the entire region\r\nof the South Caucasus have not remained immune to\r\nconflict. The current realities continue to exert\r\nconsiderable pressure on the fledgling fabric of our\r\ncountry’s new social and political relations.\r\nNevertheless, Armenia continues to build an open\r\nsociety based on the principles of democracy and the\r\nrule of law. We intend to further expand our\r\ncooperation within the United Nations and to\r\nparticipate actively in various regional institutions, in\r\nparticular the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe and the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States. We have approached the final\r\nstages of accession to membership of the Council of\r\nEurope, which is evidence of our commitment to the\r\npolicy of multiple engagements as an effective\r\ninstrument for advancing security through cooperation.\r\nWe remain convinced that the region of the South\r\nCaucasus is in need of a regional system of security,\r\nand we stand ready to work towards its formation.\r\nArmenia remains committed to the peaceful\r\nresolution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. We will\r\ncontinue to work intensively with the Co-Chairmen of\r\nthe Minsk Group, and we highlight their contribution to\r\nmaintaining the ceasefire regime. Equally, we are ready\r\nto maintain direct contacts with Azerbaijan in order to\r\nsearch for compromises, although we think that direct\r\nnegotiation between Azerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh\r\nwould be more productive. At the same time, we are\r\nconvinced that it is already possible at this stage to\r\nadvance economic cooperation between Armenia and\r\nAzerbaijan, which would certainly facilitate and\r\nexpedite the establishment of a lasting peace. Here, we\r\nare convinced that the Nagorny Karabakh conflict can\r\nbe resolved only on the basis of the legal equality of\r\nthe parties to the conflict.\r\nThe contemporary experience of conflict\r\nresolution reflects the changing nature of inter-State\r\nand intra-State relations. It clearly shows the need to\r\ngo beyond the boundaries of conventional perceptions\r\nof sovereignty.\r\nThe Armenian nation is unfortunately destined to\r\ncarry the problems of the past century into the new\r\nmillennium. Turkey’s continuing denial of the genocide\r\nof the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire has only\r\nintensified our aspirations for historical justice. Some\r\ncountries and nations were in the past burdened by\r\nsimilar problems; however, they managed to overcome\r\nthem by taking reconciliatory actions, with the support\r\nof the international community. Penitence is not\r\nhumiliation; rather, it elevates individuals and nations.\r\nI am confident that a constructive dialogue with Turkey\r\nwill allow us jointly to pave the way towards\r\ncooperation and good-neighbourly relations between\r\nour two peoples.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to once again\r\ncongratulate all of us on the occasion of the\r\nMillennium Summit, which, given the impressive level\r\nof representation, gives proof of our shared\r\ncommitment to peace and cooperation in our common\r\nhouse.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Zine\r\nEl Abidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic of\r\nTunisia.\r\nPresident Ben Ali (spoke in Arabic): The early\r\nsigns of détente among States — signs that appeared in\r\nthe late 1980s — aroused high hopes that mankind\r\nwould fulfil its legitimate aspirations for peace,\r\nprosperity and a greater development of international\r\nrelations so as to achieve a more equitable sharing of\r\nburdens and responsibilities. That period, however, was\r\nsoon followed by tensions and conflicts, with the\r\nattendant spread of epidemics and diseases,\r\ndeterioration of the environment, aggravation of\r\npoverty and indebtedness, disruption of financial\r\nmarkets and a resumption of the arms race. In the\r\ncontext of this universal crisis, it was incumbent upon\r\nthe international community to formulate a set of joint\r\ninitiatives and to codify its interventions within a\r\nframework of partnership based on a series of effective\r\nprogrammes and mechanisms to address existing\r\nproblems.\r\nThough globalization has provided new economic\r\nopportunities, accompanied by amazing scientific and\r\ntechnological advances, this has not prevented the\r\nwidening of the gap between States as regards the pace\r\nof development, or the worsening of disparities\r\nbetween rich and poor. This has indeed aroused fears\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nand prompted most observers to call for the\r\nestablishment of a joint area of prosperity, which would\r\nensure balanced and sustainable development for all\r\nthe nations of the world, without any exclusion or\r\nmarginalization.\r\nWe in Tunisia have followed a balanced strategic\r\napproach based on the principle of the universality of\r\nhuman rights as well as on the values of democracy,\r\npluralism and solidarity, and on reconciling the\r\nrequirements of promoting the economy with those of\r\nsocial progress. We have also chosen to be guided in\r\nour development programmes by the decisions of the\r\nconferences held by the United Nations over the past\r\ndecade in several fields.\r\nThe tragic living conditions of certain peoples,\r\ndue to poverty and disease, have prompted us to call\r\nfor the adoption of solidarity and cooperation among\r\nStates as an absolute humanitarian and moral necessity.\r\nIn this regard, we have proposed the conclusion of a\r\npartnership and development contract between\r\ndeveloping and developed countries, and the recycling\r\nof debts for investment in developmental and\r\nenvironmental projects. We have also proposed the\r\ncreation of a world fund for solidarity and poverty\r\neradication, to serve as an instrument for strengthening\r\nthe mechanisms of humanitarian intervention, and as a\r\nmeans to fight poverty in the most destitute parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nWhile this proposal stems from our firm belief\r\nthat solidarity among States and peoples is a\r\nhumanitarian duty and a moral obligation, it is\r\nessentially based on our conviction that human rights\r\nconstitute an indivisible whole, which will only be\r\nmade complete by safeguarding human dignity and by\r\nproviding man, wherever he may be, with the\r\nwherewithal to lead a decent life. While expressing our\r\nappreciation for the positive response given to our\r\ninitiative by many heads of State and United Nations\r\nofficials, as well as by numerous international and\r\nregional organizations and conferences, we note that\r\nwe rely on the delegations’ sense of humanitarian\r\nresponsibility and their goodwill to work for an early\r\nrealization of this proposal.\r\nThe African continent continues to this day, for\r\nmany reasons, to suffer from conflicts, deprivation and\r\nthe heavy weight of indebtedness. This state of affairs\r\nrequires the international community to take early\r\naction in the form of firm and expeditious humanitarian\r\ninitiatives to alleviate the suffering of our continent, to\r\nstrengthen peace efforts there, and to help the continent\r\novercome existing obstacles to its development process\r\nand to minimize the danger of the spread of epidemics,\r\nparticularly AIDS, among the masses of its population.\r\nI would like on this occasion to touch on the vital\r\nissue of human rights that dominates the current debate\r\nat the United Nations — namely, that these rights are\r\nbeing used nowadays as a pretext for interference in\r\nother countries’ affairs. Tunisia, which has ratified all\r\nrelevant international treaties and covenants, is\r\ndetermined to participate in developing a more\r\ndemocratic conception of international relations within\r\nthe framework of an integrated diplomacy and on the\r\nbasis of the Charter of the United Nations and its\r\nexpress provisions, including the duty to respect the\r\nprinciple of sovereignty, non-intervention in the\r\ninternal affairs of other States and the serious, impartial\r\nand equitable treatment of all questions and issues\r\nunder consideration.\r\nWe are being asked today to renew our adherence\r\nto the United Nations, which constitutes an ideal\r\nframework, incorporating all components of the\r\ninternational community, and is a fundamental base for\r\nmultilateral action. To that end, we must all cooperate\r\nin reforming the structures of the Organization and in\r\ndeveloping its working methods, while maintaining the\r\npermanent features and the foundations on which the\r\nOrganization is built.\r\nIt is our fervent hope that this historic summit\r\nwill open for us, as we step into the third millennium,\r\nbroad perspectives for using the great transformations\r\nand rapid technological progress that our world is\r\nwitnessing for the benefit of all mankind. This is a\r\nhistoric occasion that impels us to reaffirm our\r\nresponsibilities to all peoples of the world, and\r\nparticularly to the brotherly Palestinian people, so that\r\nthey can regain their legitimate rights and build their\r\nindependent State on their national soil with Al-Quds\r\nal-Sharif as its capital. These responsibilities also\r\nrequire us to renew our commitment to the United\r\nNations and our adherence to its charter and the noble\r\npurposes and principles enshrined in it.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Fernando de la Rúa, President of the Argentine\r\nRepublic.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nPresident De la Rúa (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme to convey to you, Madam, and to your Co-\r\nChairperson, my pleasure at seeing you presiding over\r\nthis historic Millennium Summit.\r\nThere are many issues related to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the new millennium. Because of the\r\ntime factor, I will refer to only one to which my\r\ncountry attaches great importance: poverty elimination\r\nas a way of preventing international conflicts or\r\ninternal conflicts with international ramifications\r\ncharacteristic of our times.\r\nI wish to highlight the fact that poverty\r\nelimination is a fundamental factor in conflict\r\nprevention, becoming the approach which, in the\r\npresent world, assumes the greatest relevance and\r\nmagnitude for the international community.\r\nIt is necessary that there be an awareness of the\r\nrelationship existing between poverty — particularly\r\nextreme poverty, malnutrition and hunger — and\r\nviolence, and that measures be adopted aimed at\r\nrefining a system of conflict resolution in keeping with\r\nthis new scenario.\r\nIt is vital that developing and developed countries\r\nact together. We will only be able to contribute to the\r\nresolution and prevention of new hotbeds of tension on\r\nthe basis of firm common will. The priority attached to\r\nsustainable development in the less developed\r\ncountries, although not the sole prerequisite,\r\nnonetheless represents an essential component of\r\neffective action to avoid violence.\r\nThis leads us to take up again the framework\r\ntheme of the Summit: the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe new millennium. The formulation of new\r\npreventive measures aimed at eradicating poverty is\r\nundoubtedly a responsibility and a role that our\r\nOrganization must exercise in accordance with the new\r\nrole that the international community expects of the\r\nUnited Nations. The relationship between peace and\r\ndevelopment is an increasingly intense one, a theme I\r\nraised in the round table this morning. We must target\r\nthe real causes of the majority of present conflicts. In\r\nthat way, cooperation programmes and projects for the\r\nneedy populations will contribute to generating the\r\natmosphere of peace and development necessary to\r\nensure a culture of prevention, stability and tolerance.\r\nI agree with the Secretary-General that\r\nemergency assistance, combatant demobilization, mine\r\nclearance, the organization of elections, social\r\nreconciliation and the restoration of basic social\r\nservices for communities affected by war will not be\r\nenough if, at the same time, ongoing long-term\r\ndevelopment programmes are not implemented in the\r\nareas of basic education, health and employment. We\r\nshould not forget that the developed countries have a\r\ndecisive role and a great responsibility in eradicating\r\npoverty. I am not only speaking about official\r\ndevelopment assistance, but also of activities to\r\nintegrate the least developed countries into\r\ninternational trade, and to eliminate barriers, quotas,\r\nsubsidies or other mechanisms that restrict trade or\r\ninvestment. It is therefore necessary, recognizing the\r\nexistence of a shared future, to assume a firm\r\ncommitment of common responsibility based on the\r\nprinciples of equity and solidarity.\r\nThis Summit should leave us with the conviction\r\nthat we need to develop preventive measures to attain\r\nsustainable development for the most backward areas\r\nand that these would not be depleted by short-term\r\nsolutions after the outbreak of conflicts, but would\r\nneutralize crises before they emerge.\r\nI wish to conclude by stating that the dispute\r\nbetween my country and the United Kingdom over the\r\nMalvinas, the South Georgia and South Sandwich\r\nIslands and the surrounding maritime areas is on this\r\nOrganization’s programme of work, which, through\r\nseveral resolutions, has requested the Governments of\r\nmy country and the United Kingdom to resume\r\nnegotiations to find a just and lasting solution to the\r\nsovereignty dispute, thus ending a colonial situation\r\nimposed by force in 1833.\r\nI wish to renew my country’s commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations in the new universal dimension of\r\npeace and justice.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ahmet\r\nNecdet Sezer, President of the Republic of Turkey.\r\nPresident Sezer (spoke in Turkish; English text\r\nfurnished by delegation): We are privileged to have two\r\nprominent statesmen, one from the northern\r\nhemisphere and the other from the southern\r\nhemisphere, co-chairing this Summit. It is also a tribute\r\nto the United Nations to see the President of Namibia\r\npresiding over this unique event; a President whose\r\nnation’s struggle for independence was spearheaded on\r\nthe international front through the work of the Council\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nfor Namibia, in which Turkey had the honour of\r\nserving as Vice- and Acting-President.\r\nIt is with a deep sense of responsibility that I\r\nhave the honour to address this largest gathering yet of\r\nworld leaders here at the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. We are expected to deliver the right\r\nmessages in order to chart the right course for the third\r\nmillennium. We should seek to ensure a better life for\r\nsuccessive generations. As the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General rightly states, the freedom from\r\nwant, the freedom from fear and the freedom of future\r\ngenerations to sustain their lives constitute the three\r\noverarching objectives for achieving further human\r\nprogress. We are living in a world where hope exists\r\nside by side with desperation, opportunities lie against\r\npoverty and great difficulties and joy are often\r\novershadowed by gloom. That we, as the global\r\ncommunity, today still expend vast resources for\r\nbenign and malign causes is perhaps the most profound\r\nirony of our time.\r\nGlobalization means and offers new opportunities\r\nto mankind. But we must still be diligent to avoid\r\nmaking the rich richer and the poor poorer. Indeed, the\r\nworld community, and the wealthy countries in\r\nparticular, have to respond energetically and sincerely\r\nto the call, strongly expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, first to alleviate and ultimately to eradicate\r\nwhat constitutes one of our greatest concerns —\r\npoverty across the globe. Africa needs the greatest\r\nattention.\r\nWith regard to this common quest, the experience\r\nof my nation’s struggle for progress and prosperity has\r\ntaught us valuable lessons. Thus, we consider reliance\r\nupon and respect for the will of the people the single\r\nmost important value to be upheld. Only through this\r\nfountainhead will other values flow and the rule of law\r\nbecome supreme. We must see to it that civil society\r\nplays an increasingly significant role in the process of\r\nextending the frontiers of democracy and safeguarding\r\nthis unsurpassed regime against extremism and\r\nfanaticism of all sorts. We must bear in mind that\r\ndemocratization and economic development are two\r\nparallel processes. In addition, assigning the highest\r\npriority to educating our youth will yield the greatest\r\nbenefit in both moral and material terms.\r\nIndeed, the events of the last century have taught\r\nus that we must ensure a fair distribution, on the\r\nnational and global scales, of the benefits of free-\r\nmarket economies and new technologies; that we must\r\nrespect the environment as a vital common asset we are\r\nto bequeath to future generations; and that we must\r\nstrengthen regional and international peace and\r\nsecurity for the benefit of all. In a nutshell, growing\r\ninterdependence between our nations is a must, not a\r\nvice, and we must therefore heed the universal values\r\nfrom which this process takes its roots. These goals can\r\nbe achieved only if they are made to reflect our\r\ncommon aspirations and are supported by meaningful\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nTurkey is determined to be more actively engaged\r\nin the endeavours of the reinvigorated United Nations\r\nas we become stronger in diverse fields, which range\r\nfrom democratic institutions to the economy, from\r\ndisaster-preparedness to social and cultural\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe are going through a defining moment in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations. The noble objectives\r\nenshrined in its Charter are as valid today as they have\r\never been. On the other hand, we remember the many\r\nsad and tragic moments when this great Organization\r\nhad to stand as an idle spectator to the scourges of\r\nwarfare and human disaster, deprivation, abject\r\nviolations of basic rights, famine and calamity.\r\nThe Secretary-General was right once again when\r\npointing to the need of developing a “culture of\r\nprevention”, along with the need to elaborate the\r\ncentral role of the United Nations in preventing\r\nconflicts. Indeed, besides providing economic and\r\nsocial assistance, the United Nations must be\r\nstrengthened in its capacities to prevent and end\r\nconflicts. Hence, we are very pleased that the thrust of\r\nthe millennium report will be reflected in the document\r\nthat we shall be adopting tomorrow.\r\nIn this context, I need to stress the importance of\r\navoiding the perpetuation of stereotype resolutions that\r\ndo not help resolve disputes and conflicts, and in which\r\nthe realities of the subject matter are not really taken\r\ninto account. Likewise, we think there is a definite\r\nneed for reforming the Security Council in a way that\r\nwill yield improved representation, transparency,\r\naccountability and that will reflect the principle of\r\nsovereign equality.\r\nThese things are easy to state. Translating them\r\ninto reality will continue to be our main task. This\r\nSummit possesses the potential to make an impact on\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nthe conscience of the international community in order\r\nto get action started and to accelerate it.\r\nI wish to conclude by saying that the children of\r\nthis world — the children of the twenty-first century\r\nwherever they may be, in the southern or northern\r\nhemisphere, but first and foremost children threatened\r\nby insecurity and poverty — they deserve a better\r\nfuture, a good future. This Summit of world leaders\r\nbears the responsibility for making this happen.\r\nFinally, I would like to comment on the statement\r\nmade by the Armenian President, which I heard with\r\ngreat regret. History must be evaluated by historians.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Rexhep Meidani, President of the Republic of\r\nAlbania.\r\nPresident Meidani: The past half-century has\r\nseen a revolution in the way in which nations are\r\ngoverned. Fifty years ago, the majority of the nations\r\nthat are now Members of the United Nations did not\r\nhave self-determination, and many of them were ruled\r\nby colonial masters or Marxist regimes. Today, the\r\nchallenges of economy and security are very different\r\nfrom those confronted during the cold war. But today’s\r\nvalues are still being defied by dictators and\r\nauthoritarian demagogues, and in some cases, fascism\r\nis still a threat in parts of Europe.\r\nOne such example is the Balkans, where the\r\nentire development of the region is being kept hostage\r\nby the wars caused directly by the criminal regime in\r\nBelgrade. The current crisis in the territory of the\r\nformer Yugoslav Federation started in Kosovo in 1989,\r\nand it will come to an end only after the right solution\r\ncan be found to this crisis, including a new, free and\r\ndemocratic Kosovo and the reconsideration of various\r\nproblems in the former Yugoslavia and of its\r\nmembership in the United Nations.\r\nIf we go back to our history, the 1648 Treaty of\r\nWestphalia established, in place of the crumbling Holy\r\nRoman Empire, nation States. But a pure nation State is\r\ndifficult to find in the real word. That is why I believe\r\nthat instead of the old concept of classic independence\r\nwe must apply a new concept of interdependence. I\r\nthink this is the path for Europe and the Balkans to\r\nmake the principle of self-determination compatible\r\nwith the principle of interdependence within the united\r\nStates of Europe. Such a path does not mean the\r\ndissolution of national sovereignty, but rather the\r\nsovereign choices nation States are making to devolve\r\nmore power to local and regional authorities or to pool\r\ntheir sovereignty within supranational authorities. This\r\nis also the way to make the concept of national\r\nsovereignty compatible with the concept of\r\nglobalization and its sub-phenomenon, regionalization.\r\nHowever, as we moved through the 1980s and the\r\n1990s, there was considerable progress in the world\r\ntowards the democratic governance. But the question\r\nwe must ask ourselves is this: can we yet reach the\r\nlimit of our avowed goal of good governance while\r\nthere are still Members of the United Nations that insist\r\non maintaining a state of conflict or even a state of war\r\nwith other Members? The answer is, frankly, no. Also,\r\ntoday it is quite clear that many countries, Albania\r\nincluded, have made an important move towards good\r\ngovernance. Particularly in the Balkans, they are\r\nembarking on a more complex set of reforms, in the\r\nframework of the Stability Pact.\r\nIt is now clear to us that where there is strong\r\ndomestic commitment to sound policies, international\r\ncontributions can be highly productive. This conclusion\r\nis by no means new. A striking vision of good and bad\r\ngovernment is seen in the famous fourteenth century\r\nSiena frescos by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, entitled “The\r\nEffects of Good and Bad Government”. Over recent\r\ndecades we have embraced anew those old truths and\r\ndeepened our understanding of poverty and how it can\r\nbe overcome, and changed the experience of helping\r\npoor regions.\r\nLecturing the poor countries and criticizing their\r\nown weak governance while providing little money to\r\nsupport technological advances, public health,\r\neducation and other needs, is cheap all right, but it\r\nsimply does not work. The strategy must be modified.\r\nIt is the same regarding environmental policy, which is\r\nstill largely concerned with repairing only what was\r\nwrong and is limited to a few recycling systems.\r\nIt is now generally accepted that, with the end of\r\nthe cold war, old ideological divisions are mostly over.\r\nBut a more intractable division is taking hold, this time\r\nbased on technology. A small part of the globe,\r\naccounting for about 15 per cent of the earth’s\r\npopulation, provides nearly all of the world’s\r\ntechnology innovations. A second part, perhaps half of\r\nthe world’s population, is able to absorb and adopt\r\nthese technologies. The remainder, about a third of the\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nworld’s population, caught in a poverty gap, is\r\ntechnologically disconnected. Unfortunately and\r\nironically, this trend is accentuated by the increasing\r\nimportance of information technology, which puts\r\ngreater power and economic rewards in the hands of\r\nthe wealthy and well educated. My call is for rich\r\ncountries to recognize this fact and to respond so that,\r\nat least, chances can be created for many of the\r\ntechnologically excluded regions to be able to adopt\r\nthe new technology and join in the benefits of\r\nglobalization.\r\nToday, there are growing doubts about the future\r\nof world policy, the world economy and world\r\ncivilization, particularly with regard to the role and\r\nstrength of different international organizations and,\r\nmore specifically, the reform of the world’s leading\r\nfinancial institutions. We must now encourage all the\r\nongoing changes and adjustments designed to increase\r\ntheir effectiveness and dynamism, through new,\r\neffective rules and even — there is no reason why\r\nnot — new principles. One of the solutions could be to\r\nreduce the requirement for consensus, particularly with\r\nregard to crisis prevention, as well as post-crisis\r\nmanagement. In this regard, efforts should be made to\r\nreach an agreement on the principles of expanding both\r\ncategories of Security Council membership, permanent\r\nand non-permanent, and of including both developing\r\nand developed countries in the permanent membership.\r\nIn the process of rapid globalization, I think that\r\nsome fundamental pillars should be conceived, such as\r\nthe strengthening of the ideology of peace, freedom\r\nand human rights as the philosophy of this century; the\r\nestablishment of a moral free-market economy on an\r\ninternational scale; the empowerment of international\r\ninstruments for security and policy-making; and the\r\ndevelopment of linguistic pluralism and cultural\r\ndiversity instead of human homogenization. Finally,\r\nthere should be a realistic approach to the concepts of\r\nsovereignty, the nation, the state, government, civil\r\nsociety, world order, security and democratization.\r\nI am certain that this Millennium Summit is\r\nprojecting the right path to respond to these problems. I\r\nam convinced that that is our challenge. That is our\r\nnew frontier: cross it we can, and cross it we must.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nMr. Chrétien (Canada): I will begin by\r\nexpressing Canada’s outrage at the murder of innocent,\r\nunarmed humanitarian personnel in West Timor. Those\r\nwho attack United Nations staff attack this\r\nOrganization and undermine the purposes and\r\nprinciples we have all come here to reaffirm. It is\r\nincumbent on the Indonesian Government to bring the\r\nperpetrators to justice.\r\nAs we mark a new millennium, the United\r\nNations is the world’s indispensable institution, and\r\nCanada is unshakably committed to its common goals\r\nand shared vision. I am pleased that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is using this millennium watershed to focus\r\nour attention on reforming the United Nations. I wish\r\nto assure him that Canada will be a creative partner in\r\nthis effort.\r\nCanada’s embrace of the United Nations reflects\r\nour common values and shared experiences. An\r\nincredibly diverse nation, we are deeply committed to\r\nfreedom, tolerance, justice and equality. We know the\r\nsense of community that comes from sharing prosperity\r\nand opportunity. We have experienced what human\r\ningenuity and creativity can achieve when people are\r\nfree from want, free from fear and free from war.\r\nIn the new century, Canada’s vision is of a world\r\nin which all people enjoy these same blessings. The\r\nUnited Nations is our best hope to marshal the common\r\nsense of purpose needed to realize this vision. But it\r\nmust meet the challenge of change.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe rise of ethnic nationalism, such as in the\r\nBalkans or Central Africa, is a stain on our humanity. It\r\nalso greatly complicates peacekeeping operations,\r\nwhose mandates must now include provisions for the\r\nprotection of civilians at risk and be matched with the\r\nnecessary resources.\r\nCanada was one of the principal architects of\r\npeacekeeping. We are also one of the most active\r\nparticipants in peacekeeping operations. We therefore\r\nencourage all Member States to be guided by the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General’s Panel on\r\nUnited Nations Peace Operations.\r\nWe must redouble our efforts to deny the agents\r\nof violence and conflict their sources of supply by\r\nhalting the proliferation of small arms and light\r\nweapons and by controlling the illicit trade in\r\ndiamonds. We must continue to make the security of\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\npeople our first priority. The Ottawa Convention\r\nbanning landmines and the agreement on the Statute of\r\nthe International Criminal Court are important\r\nmilestones in this respect. In a few days’ time, Canada\r\nwill host an International Conference on War-affected\r\nChildren.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI am also pleased to announce that Canada, with\r\nthe support of interested foundations, is leading the\r\nestablishment of an independent international\r\ncommission on intervention and State sovereignty. Our\r\nForeign Minister will shortly outline the rationale and\r\nmandate of the commission.\r\nAlleviating world poverty is our common cause.\r\nWe must share the benefits of globalization. We must\r\ngive it a human purpose and a human face. The poorest\r\ncountries require access for their goods to export\r\nmarkets. Faster, deeper and broader debt relief should\r\nbe pursued vigorously through the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative. We must ensure that\r\ndevelopment does not degrade the global environment.\r\nWe must also bridge the digital divide. We must\r\nensure that the benefits of the information revolution\r\nare shared by all. That is why Canada endorses the\r\ncreation of a United Nations Information Technology\r\nService. As former Canadian Prime Minister Lester\r\nPearson used to say, the United Nations must be a\r\nsymphony orchestra, not a string quartet. For that to\r\nhappen, it has to be supported in all respects,\r\npolitically and financially. All Members must pay their\r\nbills.\r\nWith the will and the resolve, the United Nations\r\nwill remain the world’s indispensable institution in the\r\ntwenty-first century. Canada is committed to being an\r\nindispensable partner.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Yoshiro Mori, Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Mori (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Fifty-five years have\r\npassed since the United Nations was established.\r\nThroughout this period, and particularly since the end\r\nof the cold war, progress has been made in the efforts\r\nto achieve peace and prosperity. On the other hand,\r\nthere continue to be tensions and conflicts, and\r\nconcerns over the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction are growing as well. While progress in\r\nscience and technology and the advancement of\r\nglobalization are making greater prosperity possible for\r\nhumankind, the gap between the haves and the have-\r\nnots in the international community is widening.\r\nMoreover, common challenges in such areas as the\r\nenvironment and health also demand our attention.\r\nThese are the conditions that prevail as we enter\r\nthe new century. Today, in the limited time available, I\r\nshould like to emphasize two points in particular. The\r\nfirst is the importance of dealing with issues\r\nconfronting the international community from a\r\nhuman-centred point of view, and the second is the\r\nneed to strengthen the functions of the United Nations\r\nin the new century.\r\nAt the dawn of a new century, we are faced with\r\nvarious problems such as conflicts, human rights\r\nviolations, poverty, infectious diseases, crime and\r\nenvironmental destruction, which threaten the\r\nexistence and dignity of each and every person. We\r\nmust deal with these problems from the standpoint of\r\nthe importance of each individual. This is the concept\r\nof human security. With human security as one of the\r\npillars of its diplomacy, Japan will spare no effort to\r\nmake the twenty-first century a human-centred one.\r\nThe United Nations must play, and indeed is\r\nexpected to play, a more active role in promoting such\r\na human-centred approach. Based upon this\r\nrecognition, Japan has to date contributed more than\r\n9 billion yen — or well over $80 million — to the\r\nhuman security fund, which was established at the\r\nUnited Nations in March 1999. In the near future,\r\nJapan intends to make a further contribution to this\r\nfund of approximately 10 billion yen, or roughly $100\r\nmillion. Japan also intends to establish an international\r\ncommittee on human security, with the participation of\r\nworld renowned opinion leaders, and to further develop\r\nand deepen the concept of this human-centred\r\napproach.\r\nNext, it is essential that the functions of the\r\nUnited Nations be strengthened and, in particular, that\r\nthe Security Council be reformed so that it can further\r\nmaintain the peace and security of the international\r\ncommunity, which may well be a prerequisite for\r\nensuring human security in the twenty-first century. It\r\nis clear that the Security Council of today does not\r\nfully reflect the realities of the international community\r\nas it enters the twenty-first century. In order to enhance\r\nthe legitimacy of the United Nations, it is urgently\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nnecessary to reform the Security Council so that it can\r\neffectively fulfil its expected role through its activities\r\nfor the prevention of conflicts and the maintenance of\r\npeace and security.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I strongly appeal to the\r\nrepresentatives of all Member States present: let us\r\ncreate a groundswell of support for the early realization\r\nof Security Council reform, through our discussions at\r\nthis Millennium Summit and the Millennium Assembly\r\nto follow. I am convinced that a large majority of\r\nMember States already support the expansion of the\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership of the\r\nCouncil, as well as the inclusion of both developing\r\nand developed countries in the expanded permanent\r\nmembership. Let us confirm this as a starting point and\r\nbuild up agreements, one by one, on those issues of\r\nSecurity Council reform on which we can agree.\r\nI must also emphasize that in order to strengthen\r\nthe functioning of the United Nations, it is necessary to\r\nurgently secure a sounder financial base. Towards that\r\nend, let us cooperate to realize an effective yet efficient\r\nuse of financial resources and a fairer and more\r\nequitable sharing of the financial burden among\r\nMember States.\r\nThe issues of nuclear disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation must not be forgotten as we think about\r\nthe twenty-first century. At the 2000 Review\r\nConference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, held this spring, a great step forward\r\ntowards realizing the elimination of nuclear weapons\r\nwas made, with unanimous agreement among\r\nparticipating States, including nuclear-weapon States,\r\non practical steps towards nuclear disarmament,\r\nincluding an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-\r\nweapon States to accomplish the total elimination of\r\ntheir nuclear arsenals. Japan, as the only country to\r\nhave suffered nuclear devastation, earnestly desires\r\nthat all countries join hands to free the twenty-first\r\ncentury from the fear and danger of nuclear weapons\r\nand to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. In accordance with that desire, Japan will\r\nsubmit at the Millennium Assembly a new draft\r\nresolution on the elimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nIn order to ensure that the twenty-first century is\r\na more peaceful century in which each person on earth\r\ncan be free from fear and want and enjoy lasting\r\nprosperity, all countries must work together in\r\ncooperation. Strengthening the United Nations is\r\nessential in this regard. Based upon this recognition,\r\nJapan is resolved to redouble its efforts to more\r\nactively fulfil its responsibility and its role in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Girija Prasad Koirala, Prime Minister of\r\nNepal.\r\nMr. Koirala (Nepal): I bring the Assembly warm\r\ngreetings from the Government and people of Nepal\r\nand the best wishes of His Majesty King Birendra Bir\r\nBikram Shah Dev.\r\nSince its inception, the United Nations has been\r\nworking to uphold peace, to promote the rule of law\r\nand to foster development. Yet freedom from want and\r\nfreedom from fear are as distant as ever for many\r\ncountries. The challenge before the world’s leaders\r\ntoday is to bring peace, prosperity and justice to\r\neveryone in an interdependent and globalized world.\r\nWe in Nepal believe that the United Nations can\r\nhelp achieve our goal. It is this belief that keeps our\r\nfaith alive in the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, whose ideals of freedom, equality,\r\nnon-violence and tolerance continue to sustain the\r\nhopes of humanity. That Nepal is active in\r\npeacekeeping as well as in other work of the\r\nOrganization is a clear testimony to that abiding faith.\r\nNever before had the imperative of peace been\r\nmore compelling and prospects of peace so bright as\r\nthey are today because of the unprecedented human\r\ncapacity to destroy and to create. All too often we have\r\nfailed to remove the root causes of conflict, poverty\r\nand exclusion. Poverty and conflict often reinforce\r\neach other. The current wave of globalization, though\r\nholding promise, has widened the disparity between\r\nrich and poor and has facilitated the movements of\r\nterrorists, criminals, drugs, diseases and pollution.\r\nRefugee flows have become alarming due mainly to\r\nintra-State conflicts.\r\nIt is within our collective capacity to change this.\r\nStates must exercise the requisite political will and act\r\ntogether to eliminate the threats of nuclear and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction, to control small and light\r\nweapons, to prevent conflicts and resolve disputes\r\npeacefully, to restore confidence in collective security\r\nthrough robust peacekeeping, to tackle terrorism and\r\ncrime and, above all, to bring inclusive progress.\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nReducing poverty requires sustained growth at\r\nhome and a favourable external climate. Growth entails\r\ninvestment, which the world community should help\r\npoor countries to finance by meeting agreed aid targets,\r\nbroadening debt relief measures and encouraging\r\nforeign investment. Measures must also be put in place\r\nto evenly distribute the benefits of globalization, to\r\nbridge the digital divide and to open markets in rich\r\ncountries for the products and labour of poor countries.\r\nDevelopment should be environment- and\r\nmarket-friendly to make it sustainable. The global\r\nfinancial architecture and the global trading regime\r\nmust be more responsive to the needs of poor\r\ncountries.\r\nThe least developed countries have for far too\r\nlong remained in the shadow of world attention. The\r\nlandlocked among them, like Nepal, are the worst off,\r\nas they continue to slide down. Their development\r\npartners must help them, both with adequate resources\r\nto remove their development constraints and with duty-\r\nfree and quota-free access for their exports. Transit\r\ncountries should provide better transit facilities to\r\nlandlocked countries so that they can join the global\r\neconomic mainstream.\r\nThe United Nations needs comprehensive reform\r\nin order to rise up to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. We must restore an optimal balance between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, and\r\nstrengthen the Economic and Social Council. The\r\nOrganization must bring about greater coordination\r\namong its funds, programmes and activities, as well as\r\nwith the Bretton Wood institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization. If the Organization is to be effective,\r\nMember States must provide it with adequate\r\nresources. The Secretary-General’s millennium report\r\noffers many useful insights to address global problems\r\nand reform the Organization.\r\nWe share a common humanity and face a shared\r\ndestiny. States committed to democracy, human rights\r\nand good governance that are willing to take bold steps\r\nand work with each other, as well as with civil society,\r\ncan make a difference. People shall judge us by our\r\nleadership in promoting peace, prosperity and justice\r\nfor every man, woman and child around the world.\r\nNepal will do its part.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Defence and Public Service of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Mosisili (Lesotho): We are at an important\r\njuncture in human history, a time of reflection on the\r\nrole of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury — the United Nations in which most of\r\nhumankind places much faith and hope for a bright\r\nfuture. Can we say with confidence that such faith and\r\nhope are justifiably placed? Whatever answer we give\r\nto that question, I believe it is within our capability to\r\nmake it so. There is no doubt that when the United\r\nNations was created, in 1945, the expectations of all\r\npeoples of the world were high for an institution that\r\npromised an era of peace and security and the\r\nbetterment of the living conditions of all peoples.\r\nGiven the pall of despair that had descended upon\r\nthe world following a prolonged and brutal war, the\r\nhuman spirit could not but be uplifted by the lofty\r\nwords and intentions of the Charter of the United\r\nNations:\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war”,\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human\r\nrights, in the dignity and worth of the human\r\nperson, in the equal rights of men and women and\r\nof nations large and small, and”\r\n“to promote social progress and better\r\nstandards of life in larger freedom”.\r\nUnfortunately, it was not until 50 years later, in\r\n1994, that institutionalized colour discrimination was\r\ndefeated in South Africa. In a similar vein, the poor\r\ncountries of the South, including my own, are yet to\r\nsee genuine economic emancipation, despite the\r\ncreation of the International Bank for Reconstruction\r\nand Development and the International Monetary Fund,\r\nwhich are meant to give practical meaning to the lofty\r\naspirations of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe attainment of democracy in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica must be accompanied by corresponding\r\neconomic gains and the reduction of poverty. However,\r\nthe majority of us who have embraced democracy are\r\nyet to reap the fruits of that change. We have waited\r\ntoo long, and change must come now. We are unable to\r\nmeet the challenges of globalization and to take\r\nadvantage of the opportunities it offers for\r\ndevelopment and the relief of poverty. We are similarly\r\nunable to take full advantage of the opportunities\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\npresented by advances in information and\r\ncommunications technology, which hold great\r\nprospects for our rapid development. The defining\r\nchallenge of the twenty-first century is how to close the\r\npresent gap in development between the developed and\r\nthe developing nations.\r\nThe renaissance that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has been experiencing in the last three years is\r\nvery gratifying and must be sustained. Its role in\r\ntranslating our aspirations into reality should be\r\nstrengthened. It will therefore be necessary in the\r\ntwenty-first century to rethink the powers of that body\r\nso that it is put on a footing commensurate with its\r\nimportance.\r\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, we must\r\ncontinue to dream of a future filled with hope for\r\nhumanity. A policy framework that is regaining\r\ncurrency is that of a new global human order whose\r\nessential elements are, first, the creation of a new\r\npartnership between developing and developed\r\ncountries, based on full cooperation for their mutual\r\nbenefit; secondly, the promotion of democratic culture\r\nand good governance; thirdly, the adoption of a\r\ndevelopment strategy that is centred on people as\r\nobjects of development, and one that is sensitive to\r\nissues of equity, gender equality, the rights of\r\nindigenous people and the protection of the\r\nenvironment; fourthly, increased productivity and\r\nproduction with equity through the application of\r\nscience and technology; fifthly, the elimination of the\r\ndebt burden for developing countries; sixthly, the\r\nreduction of extreme poverty; and, lastly, the creation\r\nof a global development facility funded by such new\r\nand innovative sources of financing as cuts in military\r\nspending, levies on pollution and a tax on speculative\r\ncapital.\r\nFinally, we would like to join all delegations in\r\ncalling for a United Nations that is strengthened and\r\nequipped with resources to wage war against\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The Right\r\nHonourable Percival James Patterson, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister of Defense of Jamaica.\r\nMr. Patterson (Jamaica): The closing decades of\r\nthe twentieth century have brought mankind to new\r\nhorizons, extending beyond the nation State to create a\r\nwider circle of human identity and building a new\r\nsense of global consciousness. In earlier times,\r\nphilosophers, poets and other visionaries recognized\r\nthe existence of one human family. It is a concept\r\nwhich our people have grown increasingly to accept.\r\nPhotographs from space, showing a single Earth\r\nsuspended in space, have served dramatically to\r\nconfirm the sense of one borderless world, giving a\r\npowerful stimulus to the spread of this perception of\r\nhuman unity and global oneness. Acknowledgement of\r\nthis reality must be the starting point of this Assembly\r\nas we mark the start of a new millennium.\r\nThe establishment of the United Nations was one\r\nof the principal achievements of the century and the\r\nCharter is unquestionably a landmark document, giving\r\na clear signal in the movement to a wider, global\r\nidentity. During the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, several important contributions were made to\r\nstrengthen the capacity of the world community to\r\naddress the major global issues which confront us.\r\nDiscussions on reform were launched, but enthusiasm\r\nwas lacking and inertia triumphed. Reform was\r\nsubverted into a crusade for downsizing and\r\nretrenchment.\r\nAnd so we embark on the new millennium with a\r\nglaring structural deficit: the absence of an organ —\r\ncomparable in standing and authority, but more\r\nrepresentative in its composition — to address major\r\nglobal questions in the economic domain, the social\r\nfield and the environment of our planet. There remains\r\na yawning gap in the institutions of global governance\r\nthat we must quickly fill.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, universal global\r\npeace and security remain under constant threat\r\nbecause of large-scale and persistent poverty;\r\nincreasing instability in the world economy; the\r\nlooming global contest between resources and\r\nconsumption; and the prospect of poor countries’ being\r\nobliged to pay for the indulgence of the rich. Poverty\r\nremains the single greatest challenge facing mankind.\r\nEven as globalization presents new vistas of\r\nopportunities, half of the world\u0027s peoples suffer the\r\ndeprivation, despair and powerlessness of extreme\r\npoverty.\r\nWe must seize this unique moment to forge global\r\npartnerships for decisive action against poverty and\r\nsocial exclusion. We live in a fool’s paradise to think\r\nthat the status quo can be indefinitely maintained. The\r\nchallenges, indeed, are multiplying. The poor have\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nneither the time nor the interest to discuss the theories\r\nof economic globalization. Even as they experience its\r\nharsh realities, the globalized media, with a vastly\r\nextended reach, now enable the poor to see how the\r\nrich actually live. They can observe that, if the roads of\r\nthe cities of the industrialized world are not paved with\r\ngold, they are a gateway to much greater opportunity\r\nthan their present life offers.\r\nThe digital revolution is a demonstrable source of\r\ntremendous benefit to mankind. Yet information\r\ntechnology is dangerously poised to become the new\r\nbarrier — a powerful force of exclusion in the new\r\nmillennium. Let us exploit the digital revolution for\r\nhuman development in the creation of a global\r\nknowledge-based economy. I call for effective and\r\nmeaningful collaboration among all stakeholders in the\r\ninternational community so that information\r\ntechnology can impact positively on the lives of all our\r\npeople. There must be no gender disparity in this new\r\nrevolution. It must embrace our children and youth, the\r\ndisabled, our rural communities and ethnic minorities.\r\nThe challenge that faces this Millennium\r\nAssembly is the age-old one that has faced humanity at\r\nall turning points in history. Do we ignore the signals\r\nof self-destruction or do we heed them and change\r\ncourse? Indisputably, we must respond to them with the\r\nspirit of global solidarity that is essential to their\r\nfulfilment. To do any less is to fail in our duty to our\r\nown and future generations.\r\nAnd there is no better, more practical, more\r\neffective way to start than to endow the United Nations\r\nwith the capacity and competence to bring that spirit of\r\nglobal solidarity to the fulfilment of the long-stated\r\naims and objectives of the Charter. We must strengthen\r\nthe United Nations by making it a truly democratic\r\ninstrument of human progress. Only serious and\r\ncourageous action, and genuine commitment to\r\nchanging the status quo, will be worthy of our coming\r\ntogether here in this commemorative Summit. In the\r\nnew millennium, we must become good stewards for\r\nthis and succeeding generations. Let us begin now.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Roosevelt Douglas, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign, Legal, Labour and Carib Affairs\r\nof the Commonwealth of Dominica.\r\nMr. Douglas (Dominica): What makes the start\r\nof this new century both fascinating and frightening is\r\nthe fact that we can only enjoy the benefit of it,\r\ncognizant of the fact that none of us here will see the\r\nend of it. In short, we will not be present to take credit\r\nfor the achievements, nor to shoulder the blame for the\r\nfailures of our policies.\r\nIt has been said that the century which we are\r\nentering can and must be the century of the common\r\nman and common woman. This is very true, as it is the\r\ncommon man who will judge the efficacy of this\r\ninstitution and will pronounce whether or not we were\r\ntruly successful in fulfilling the promises of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nBut the bigger question is: should we succeed in\r\nleaving the common man a higher standard of living,\r\naccess to affordable health care, peace and security and\r\ngood economic prospects, will he be able to enjoy them\r\non the planet that we will leave to him? I ask this\r\nquestion because the truth is, the common man will\r\njudge us most of all on the state of the planet that we\r\nwill bequeath to him and the generations after him.\r\nThe indiscriminate destruction of our forests,\r\nrampant overfishing of our oceans and the pollution of\r\nthe air and soil take less time to occur than it will take\r\nto repair the damage that has been created. Our concern\r\ncannot be overstated since we, the small States, the\r\nmost vulnerable members of this Assembly, are the\r\nones that will bear the burden of the very real threats of\r\nclimate change and environmental degradation.\r\nThis issue of environmental vulnerability further\r\ncompounds the economic vulnerability with which we\r\nare faced as we enter this new century. Indeed, it is\r\neconomic security that we need to ensure that we\r\nprovide for the common man of generations to come.\r\nFor without economic security, the stability, openness\r\nand good governance to which we all aspire will not be\r\nattainable.\r\nThe viability of this Organization will be called\r\ninto question if a few members are strong while the\r\nmajority are weak, feeble, marginalized and powerless.\r\nI say this because the majority of the countries in the\r\nCaribbean are small, structurally weak, with vulnerable\r\neconomies that lack the financial and human resources\r\nand the institutional capacity necessary to compete in\r\nthis global economy and to benefit from the trade\r\nopportunities which may exist.\r\nMy country, Dominica, presently boasts the living\r\nreality of the world’s two oldest human beings,\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nElizabeth Pampo Israel, 125 years old, in Glanvillia,\r\nDominica, and Rose Charles, 119 years old. Both are\r\nalive and well in Dominica.\r\nWhile we are doing our part to become\r\nincorporated in this new era of globalization, we have\r\nso far been unable to identify any tangible benefits\r\nfrom international agreements such as those that\r\ngovern the World Trade Organization (WTO). Instead,\r\nwe have witnessed the erosion of market access and\r\nexport earnings from bananas. We strongly urge\r\norganizations like the WTO to recognize the unique\r\ncircumstances of small, structurally weak and\r\nvulnerable States and to make special provisions for\r\nthese States in the formulation of their policies and\r\nregulations.\r\nThe difficulties that my country currently faces\r\nwith respect to the banana industry, and to agriculture\r\nin general, has left us no alternative but to intensify our\r\nefforts to diversify the economy, while we stand firm\r\nwith our banana farmers and move, where possible,\r\ninto organic farming. The challenges of diversification\r\ncome at a time when we are losing our valuable human\r\nresources to the more advanced wage markets of the\r\nNorth, when the unstoppable process of trade\r\nliberalization is forcing us back into traditional markets\r\nand, in some countries, when extreme poverty\r\ndemoralizes the majority of the labour force.\r\nIt is very obvious that we cannot afford to let the\r\ninformation technology revolution pass us by. This\r\nwould not only result in the marginalization of\r\ncountries like my own but would also put into question\r\nthe viability and stability of the countries themselves.\r\nThe information technology revolution has widened the\r\ngap between the “haves” and the “have nots”, with the\r\n“haves” enjoying the good life and the “have nots”\r\nfloundering in poverty. Despite the opportunities that\r\nmay exist, we should not forget that well over half of\r\nthe world’s population does not even have access to\r\nbasic telephone services.\r\nIt is the poor, particularly women and children,\r\nwho are most affected by economic crises, epidemics\r\nand natural disasters. We have every reason to be\r\ntroubled by this, as poverty impedes the contribution\r\nthat vast numbers of our populations can make towards\r\nnational development.\r\nThe Millennium Report calls for one billion\r\npeople to be lifted out of poverty by the year 2015.\r\nThis is laudable. However, many developing countries\r\nare unable to fund programmes that eradicate poverty,\r\ndue to the high burden of external debt which serves as\r\nan impediment to sustainable economic development.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations can play a\r\nvital role in shaping and influencing a new regime of\r\nmultilateral economic governance among the\r\ninternational lending agencies, urging them to institute\r\npolicies for debt relief, so as to ensure that the\r\nfundamental, underlying causes of indebtedness are\r\neliminated, thereby ensuring that the cycle of poverty\r\nitself is broken. Dominica is sparing no effort to\r\nupgrade our offshore legislation to reduce and\r\neliminate any possibilities of money laundering. At the\r\nsame time, we demand our sovereign rights and are\r\ncommitted to continuing the development of our\r\noffshore sector, like other countries in the Caribbean.\r\nLess than two centuries ago, slavery was\r\ndefeated. Apartheid and fascism were defeated in the\r\nlast century. It is now our obligation to direct our full\r\nenergy to entomb racism in this century in all its\r\nmanifestations. One of the greatest men of the last\r\ncentury, Martin Luther King, said that the arc of the\r\nmoral universe is long and wide, but it always bends\r\ntowards justice. Real peace will never come without\r\njustice. Dominica is easily one of the most beautiful\r\nislands in the world. It is committed to pursue the\r\ncourse of peace; to play its part in seeking a cure for\r\nthe dreaded AIDS epidemic; to strengthen Caribbean\r\nand Latin American cooperation; and to contribute to\r\nthe strengthening of the unity of all African States and\r\nSouth-South cooperation. Locked in geographically\r\nbetween the French Departments of Guadeloupe and\r\nMartinique, with which we share strong historical ties,\r\nwe have been obliged to seek a new relationship with\r\nFrance and the European Union to ensure our economic\r\nviability.\r\nDominica will always be committed within the\r\nfamily of the United Nations to support the course of\r\npeacekeeping and conflict resolution in the world and\r\nof sustainable development among the poor nations and\r\nthe attainment of popular democracy to ensure popular\r\nparticipation and decentralization at all levels of\r\nsociety, and it will respect the right of the Republic of\r\nChina to adequate representation.\r\nFinally, we salute the bold task being undertaken\r\nby our brother, Kofi Annan, and the United Nations in\r\ninstituting this very timely debate among Member\r\nStates.\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Cheikh\r\nEl Avia Ould Mohamed Khouna, Prime Minister of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania.\r\nMr. Ould Mohamed Khouna (Mauritania)\r\n(spoke in Arabic): I am particularly pleased and\r\nhonoured to address you, on behalf of the President of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Mauritania, Mr. Maaouya Ould\r\nSid’Ahmed Taya, on the occasion of the Millennium\r\nSummit organized under the topic of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century. I would like\r\nat this point to extend my warm congratulations to the\r\nCo-Chairpersons of this historic Summit, Dr. Sam\r\nNujoma, President of the Republic of Namibia and\r\nMiss Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of\r\nFinland. We are convinced that their experience and\r\nwisdom will guarantee the success of our work.\r\nI would also like to express to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan our appreciation for the efforts he has\r\nconstantly been making since he assumed his duties to\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations and to enable\r\nit to fulfil its responsibilities.\r\nEver since its founding, the United Nations has\r\nbeen making important achievements in the political,\r\neconomic and social areas, thus responding to the\r\naspirations of peoples and States to freedom,\r\nindependence and peace. The United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies have, furthermore, played an\r\nessential role in promoting sustainable development in\r\nall economic, social and environmental spheres.\r\nBe that as it may, the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization, marking the end of this century, and the\r\nmagnitude of the challenges facing our world, more\r\nthan ever require more international cooperation and\r\nsolidarity to reach equitable and harmonious\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya, the\r\nPresident of our Republic, said:\r\n“Today’s world, which has become a global\r\nvillage and where distances have been shortened\r\nthanks to scientific and technological progress\r\nand to the communications and information\r\nrevolution, must work to correct the imbalance\r\ndue to the widening gap that separates the rich\r\ncountries from the poor ones”.\r\nToday our world is facing major challenges that\r\nare hindering the development process and increasing\r\nmarginalization and poverty among a large part of\r\nhumanity. Much of the world’s population continues to\r\nsuffer from the effects of poverty, disease, epidemics\r\nand ignorance, as well as those of wars, conflicts and\r\nenvironmental threats such as pollution and\r\ndesertification. Our collective responsibility in this\r\nrespect is to ensure that together we meet these\r\nchallenges in a spirit of cooperation and mutual\r\nassistance among all countries and all peoples.\r\nSince indebtedness is one of the major problems\r\nfacing the developing countries, the international\r\ncommunity must find an urgent and radical solution to\r\nit so that the available resources can be used for\r\ndevelopment efforts. Our country welcomes the recent\r\ninternational initiatives taken to this end.\r\nThe upheavals experienced by the world and the\r\nchallenges confronting humankind require a renewal of\r\nthe methods and structures of our Organization. In this\r\nrespect, reform and restructuring of its bodies are\r\nnecessary so that they can be adapted to new realities.\r\nTo this end we appreciate the initiative taken by the\r\nSecretary-General to reform and restructure the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe also place great hope in the results of the\r\nwork of the Working Group mandated by the General\r\nAssembly to consider expanded representation in the\r\nSecurity Council. We reiterate our support for this idea\r\nand for the idea of increasing the number of its\r\npermanent members by admitting developing countries\r\nand other industrialized countries, in accordance with\r\nthe rules of democracy, transparency and justice, with a\r\nview to ensuring equitable geographical representation\r\nin the Council, so that it reflects the universal character\r\nof our Organization, in accordance with Article 24 of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We are convinced\r\nthat these reforms will allow the United Nations to\r\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nBefore I conclude, I wish to reaffirm the\r\ncommitment of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania to\r\nworking to achieve the noble ideals of the United\r\nNations, with a view to the promotion and\r\nconsolidation of international peace and security and\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation and solidarity among\r\nnations in order to bring about a better world free of\r\nwar, famine and underdevelopment.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Sir James\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nFitz-Allen Mitchell, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines.\r\nSir James Fitz-Allen Mitchell (Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines): The history of our civilization has\r\nbeen an evolving relationship between the organic and\r\nthe inorganic. It has evolved with intimate relationships\r\nbetween all living creatures and the planet Earth, which\r\nwe inherited.\r\nThis intimate relationship among living beings\r\ncreated the concepts and the values of family, home\r\nand nation. Over thousands of years, national\r\nboundaries became demarcated. Rivalries regarding\r\nthese boundaries and the exploitation of resources led\r\nto wars, and then to the search for peace, which gave\r\nrise to the founding of the United Nations.\r\nOur religious heritage has taught us how to reach\r\nacross the boundaries of nations through the very\r\ninspirational guideline, “Love your neighbour as\r\nyourself.” Today we are sensitive to the imperatives of\r\nthe global village, and our neighbours, through the\r\ntechnological revolution, are everywhere. And yet the\r\ncompetition among the peoples of the world has\r\nbecome fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead\r\nand widening the gap between them and poor\r\ncountries. Having access to the markets in the\r\ndeveloped countries is the key to long-term economic\r\ndevelopment for the poor countries.\r\nSmall island States such as our own, with an\r\nenviable record of good governance and human rights,\r\nhave seen the mighty in the banana trade using the\r\ninternational rules — crafted by them — impede our\r\neconomic growth. Similarly, the verdicts that have been\r\nimposed by the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) countries on\r\nour financial services, without our having the right to\r\nbe heard, demonstrate total disrespect. So-called\r\nharmful taxation, so-called harmful tax competition is\r\nabout whose treasury collects the taxes. Where is the\r\nfairness in free trade in all of this?\r\nOffshore financial services is one of our chosen\r\navenues of economic diversification. Since it appears\r\nas though there is no place or space for us in the\r\nproduction of goods, we thought that we should\r\nprovide a financial service to those who do produce\r\ngoods. Our decision to service the wealth generated\r\nelsewhere is part of our attempt at economic survival.\r\nWe recognize that our financial system must\r\nprovide opportunities for the enjoyment of the fruits of\r\none’s labour. However, we want it to be understood\r\nthat we are committed to being responsible members of\r\nthe international community, including playing our part\r\nin the war against the drug trade and money-\r\nlaundering.\r\nEach successive generation of youth must be\r\nprovided with a ray of hope, and in the twenty-first\r\ncentury our world’s leaders must provide meaningful\r\nchange to enhance the quality of life for all the world’s\r\npeople. Development, no matter what we build, is\r\nabout people and the quality of their lives. Only when\r\nthis objective is realized will globalization be accepted\r\nas a practical policy of creating equity of opportunities\r\nfor human development.\r\nThe challenges of the twenty-first century lie in\r\nthe battles against poverty and the HIV virus. The\r\ndevelopment of human capital is the main priority for\r\nsmall nation-States such as St. Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines.\r\nThe United Nations must find a way to focus\r\ncontinually on the equitable distribution of the world’s\r\nwealth. The unilateral imposition of the will of the\r\nstrong and the wealthy on the small, vulnerable and\r\npoor will not produce the stability, security and peace\r\nthat are fundamental to attaining the quality of life to\r\nwhich we all aspire.\r\nThis should be the guiding spirit behind our\r\nreform. With this spirit, we should preserve humanity\r\nwell into the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Mart\r\nLaar, Prime Minster of Estonia.\r\nMr. Laar (Estonia): Despite the fact that the\r\nUnited Nations has indeed achieved a lot over the past\r\n55 years, the Organization has not always lived up to\r\nthe expectations the world had when it was first\r\nfounded. This uneven record is also described in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. Let me give an example of\r\nthe differences between the high expectations and the\r\nreality. In 1972, freedom fighters in the then occupied\r\nEstonia wrote an appeal to the United Nations. They\r\nconsidered the United Nations to be an unquestioned\r\nmoral authority. In the real world, they ended up in the\r\nprison camps of the USSR without any notice from this\r\nhigh body. The USSR happened to be a big Power. The\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nUnited Nations of the new millennium must make\r\nchanges.\r\nTo achieve that important goal, the decision-\r\nmaking and financial procedures of the United Nations\r\nhave to be adapted, and the Organization must be\r\nstreamlined. We need a United Nations that will be an\r\neffective, accountable and representative organization\r\nthat represents us all, large and small countries,\r\nequally. But this has another side as well: Member\r\nStates themselves must be willing to pitch in. It is not\r\nenough to demand that the United Nations do\r\nsomething; we have to provide it with the necessary\r\ntools to do its work. That means that we must lead by\r\nexample. Let me focus on three points that we in\r\nEstonia consider important. First, open government and\r\nopen markets are a precondition for economic recovery\r\nand growth. Secondly, the information technology\r\nsector is a vital conduit to successful development.\r\nAnd thirdly, no country can allow itself to take\r\nadvantage of a discount on security.\r\nOn the first point, the Secretary-General’s report\r\nto the Assembly (A/54/2000) focused on the\r\neradication of poverty and on making the world a more\r\nequal place. This is important. It can be achieved by\r\nalleviating debt and by providing more development\r\nassistance. I think both of those aspects are vital.\r\nHowever, what is crucial is that States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations should commit themselves to good\r\ngovernance and open markets. Without a commitment\r\nto these two elements, no amount of aid and no amount\r\nof debt relief will achieve that aim, an aim we all have\r\nto strive for.\r\nI am convinced that small countries, such as\r\nEstonia, can provide an important example of how to\r\nmanage economic restructuring. We have been able to\r\nshow that opening up our markets to outside\r\ncompetition, cutting and indeed eliminating tariffs,\r\nprivatizing our economy and making the Government\r\naccountable to the people bring tangible benefits. The\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme has provided\r\nperhaps the best illustration of the effectiveness of our\r\napproach. In two years, Estonia has moved 30 places\r\nup in the Human Development Index and we belong\r\ntoday to the group of countries that evince high human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSecondly, in his report, the Secretary-General\r\nhighlighted the need to ensure that the benefits of new\r\ntechnology, especially information technology, become\r\navailable to all. The high-level panel of experts on\r\ninformation and communication technology has called\r\nfor Internet access for all of the world’s population by\r\nthe end of 2004. That is an ambitious goal and\r\ncertainly not an easy task, but it is doable. The Internet\r\nmay not be a cure for all ills; indeed we have to be very\r\ncareful not to overestimate the importance of the\r\nInternet or to underestimate its shortcomings. However,\r\na prerequisite for the spread of the Internet and of the\r\nWorld Wide Web is total and unfettered access. Yet\r\naction to ensure this opportunity is less and less global\r\nin scale: local action is called for, mostly in the hands\r\nof national Governments. Those that embrace openness\r\nare also able to enhance the opportunity of their\r\ncitizens to reach out to qualitatively new horizons.\r\nWe have committed ourselves to promoting\r\ninformation technology through a nationwide\r\nprogramme guaranteeing each and every schoolgirl and\r\nschoolboy in Estonia free access to the Internet. Today,\r\nthe Estonian Government carries out its sessions via\r\ncomputer, and Estonia has risen to be among the 20\r\nmost computerized nations in the world. But this not\r\nenough. Equal distribution of money and information\r\nalone does not guarantee well-being. We have to secure\r\nan environment where it can be enjoyed. The next and\r\ndecisive move for mankind is to invest in ecological\r\ntechnologies that allow us to live in partnership with\r\nnature.\r\nWe know how difficult it is to start such a\r\nprogramme with limited resources. But we also know\r\nwhat benefits can be gained from it. That is why\r\nEstonia is committed to work together with the United\r\nNations to assist other Member States to create new\r\nopportunities for themselves and for the world as a\r\nwhole.\r\nThirdly, just as we in Estonia have come to\r\nunderstand that we must transmit some of the know-\r\nhow we have gained to other United Nations Members,\r\nwe have also reached the position that we cannot live\r\non discounted security. That is why the Estonian\r\nGovernment decided this year to give up the 80 per\r\ncent discount that we have used so far and to pay our\r\ncontribution to peacekeeping in full. It is important that\r\nif we expect the United Nations to perform ever more,\r\nand more complicated, tasks, we must also be willing\r\nto foot the bill. Naturally Estonia’s contribution in\r\nitself is not much in dollar terms. However, if every\r\nMember of the United Nations paid its assessed dues in\r\nfull we would make a considerable step forward.\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nBut paying our dues is not enough, of course. The\r\npeacekeeping system of the United Nations has to be\r\nmade more effective and better adapted to the\r\nchallenges of today, as mentioned in the recent report\r\non peacekeeping (A/55/305). As we have all seen, the\r\nterm “peacekeeping” itself is no longer appropriate at a\r\ntime when what is needed more than keeping the peace\r\nis establishing a peaceful environment. Whether this\r\ntask be delegated to other organizations such as the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, or whether it be\r\nthe United Nations itself that carries out these tasks, we\r\nhave to be able to face the new challenges of the new\r\nmillennium in the peacekeeping field as well. Estonia\r\nfavours giving the United Nations a stronger mandate\r\nto establish and preserve the peace.\r\nI hope we all will consider it our main duty to\r\nhelp the renewed United Nations to make a difference\r\nin the new millennium.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Adolf\r\nOgi, President of the Swiss Confederation.\r\nPresident Ogi (spoke in French): Time did not\r\nstop with the end of the cold war. History continues. As\r\nwe embark on a new millennium, we are writing a new\r\npage in our history. This is an opportunity to go\r\nforward and to make progress. We must seize that\r\nopportunity.\r\nThe twentieth century was one of great scientific,\r\ntechnological, economic and cultural discoveries. But\r\nthe twentieth century was also one of conflict and\r\nhuman tragedy of the most violent, the most murderous\r\nand the most horrendous kind. Yes, we are embarking\r\non a new century and a new millennium. But what we\r\nbequeath to future generations will depend on our\r\ncommon will. If we lack that will, what will our legacy\r\nbe?\r\nSwitzerland shares the objectives of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan’s millennium report. We thank\r\nhim for his vision and commitment. Switzerland is with\r\nhim. Switzerland has the same values as the United\r\nNations — peace, stability, democracy and the\r\nobservance of human rights. This is why Switzerland\r\nintends to enhance its relations with the United\r\nNations.\r\nSwitzerland hosts in Geneva a major headquarters\r\nof the United Nations system. It is a member of most of\r\nthe organizations of the system, and contributes\r\ngenerously to the United Nations budget, but today it\r\nhas only observer status in the General Assembly —\r\nthough peace, security and well-being are the business\r\nof all. The Swiss people will decide about joining the\r\nUnited Nations in 2002.\r\nDespite all our hopes, wars and violence are still\r\nwith us. But within a century the face of war has\r\nchanged. Wars take place less frequently between\r\nStates, but increasingly within States. The participants,\r\ntheir objectives and these conflicts are of a new type.\r\nThe conflicts are most often of a local nature and inter-\r\nethnic, or simply the work of terrorists.\r\nNonetheless, these conflicts can destabilize entire\r\ncountries. Their consequences are felt across borders.\r\nThey have a lasting impact on the people and their\r\nattitudes. It has become more difficult to ensure respect\r\nfor international humanitarian law, because the actors\r\nin conflicts are no longer just States.\r\nWe cannot remain passive in the face of this\r\nsuffering and these tragedies. Unfortunately, traditional\r\ninternational law is no longer sufficient. We must\r\nexplore new approaches and develop new tools — and\r\nperhaps also new structures within the United Nations.\r\nDuring and after the conflicts, after the terror and\r\nintolerance have come to an end, we must seek out and\r\npunish the guilty. This is why I salute the efforts to set\r\nup the International Criminal Court as soon as possible\r\nand to ensure its integrity.\r\nBut we must also heal the wounds left by history.\r\nIn this regard, the Republic of South Africa has given\r\nan excellent example with its Truth and Reconciliation\r\nCommission, chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu,\r\nNobel Peace Prize Laureate. I hope this example will\r\nbe followed elsewhere in the world.\r\nHuman security also requires fighting against\r\npoverty and inequalities. This is one of our priorities,\r\nbecause the fruits of globalization must benefit the\r\nwhole of humankind. The United Nations is called\r\nupon to play a key role so that this objective can be\r\nachieved. It is the only international organization with\r\na truly global perspective on today’s problems:\r\neconomic and social development, environmental and\r\nhealth issues, new technologies, and the promotion of\r\ndemocracy and human rights. Switzerland wants to\r\ntake up this challenge with the Member States. In this\r\nspirit, we support the idea of holding in Geneva a\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nsummit on the new information and communications\r\ntechnologies.\r\nHowever, the resolutions passed at such\r\noccasions are one thing; they also need to be\r\nimplemented. The history of the United Nations shows\r\nthis. Should we not also envisage new structures that\r\ncould take binding decisions and be charged with\r\nseeing that they are carried out? I am thinking of a\r\nstructure akin to the Security Council, but for issues of\r\ncivil society. The States must explore new approaches\r\nto meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow,\r\ntogether — that is, collectively. This is an opportunity\r\nthat we must seize.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Switzerland, before this\r\nAssembly, announces: “We and Geneva are ready to\r\nseek solutions with your countries, with the United\r\nNations and with you.”\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Somsavat Lengsavad, Deputy Prime Minister of\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in Laotian; English text provided by\r\nthe delegation): At the dawn of the new millennium\r\nour world is facing both challenges and favourable\r\nopportunities. In the past half century, the world has\r\nrecorded unprecedented economic achievements,\r\nthanks to the rapid advance of science and technology.\r\nAs a result, many countries have now attained a high\r\nlevel of development. However, unfortunately the gap\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries is\r\nfurther widening. While the living standard in some\r\ncountries has improved, almost half of the world’s\r\npopulation still lives in extreme poverty. In this\r\nrespect, we hope that the developed and more fortunate\r\ncountries will seriously implement the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration to help the least-developed\r\ncountries, the landlocked developing countries and\r\nsmall island developing States rid themselves of\r\npoverty. The Lao Government has given priority to\r\npoverty eradication by integrating it into the national\r\npolicy and programme.\r\nThe issue of heavy indebtedness has become one\r\nof the obstacles to economic development in\r\ndeveloping countries. Therefore, a solution to the debt\r\nproblem in various forms, particularly for the least-\r\ndeveloped countries, is necessary if they are to acquire\r\nbasic resources for building national economic\r\nfoundations for achieving self-sufficiency in the long\r\nrun.\r\nAnother issue of concern to the majority of\r\ncountries in the world, particularly weak nations, is the\r\nconcept of “humanitarian intervention”. This concept\r\ncould quite easily become a cover for gratuitous\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of sovereign States.\r\nTherefore, we are of the view that at the turn of the\r\nnew millennium it is imperative that all general\r\nprinciples of international law and of the United\r\nNations Charter — in particular, the principles of the\r\nsovereign equality of all Member States, respect for the\r\nnational sovereignty of independent States and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States — be\r\nstrictly observed.\r\nMr. Tuomioja (Finland) took the Chair.\r\nBuilding a prosperous, more secure and equitable\r\ntwenty-first century is a task that requires the will and\r\ndetermined efforts of the entire world community. In\r\nthis process, the United Nations has a crucial role to\r\nplay. Therefore, it is imperative to reform the United\r\nNations, in particular its Security Council, so that it\r\nmight gain legitimacy, be more transparent and be in a\r\nmuch better position to carry out its responsibilities.\r\nOn Security Council reform we maintain our firm\r\nposition in favour of the expansion of both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership of the\r\nCouncil, adding seats for both developing and\r\nindustrialized countries. No less important, let us also\r\nresolve to ensure that the United Nations is given the\r\nnecessary resources so that it can live up to its\r\nenormous tasks in development assistance.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic will,\r\ntogether with all peoples all over the world, take\r\nappropriate action to prove its commitment. In this\r\nspirit, I wish the Summit a successful conclusion.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Monie Captan, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLiberia.\r\nMr. Captan (Liberia): On the occasion of this\r\nMillennium Summit, I am honoured to participate in\r\nthis historic session on behalf of His Excellency\r\nMr. Charles G. Taylor, President of the Republic of\r\nLiberia.\r\nPermit me to congratulate our Co-Chairpersons\r\nfor their selection to chair this Millennium Summit.\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nI wish to also salute and extend deepest thanks\r\nand appreciation to the Secretary-General on this\r\nhistoric occasion for his efforts in the search for\r\ninternational peace and understanding.\r\nThis Millennium Summit cannot and should not\r\nfollow the traditional pleasantries of congratulations\r\nand self-indulgence so characteristic of high profile\r\nmeetings of this sort. Rather, this Summit should be a\r\nforum for the members of the international community\r\nto express their concerns as sovereign equals in the\r\nfinest tradition of the universal values of equity, social\r\njustice, freedom and equality.\r\nIf we should, in that process, offend others in our\r\ncommon community because we proclaim our rights as\r\nwell as the responsibility we assume, then we do so\r\nwithout regret. We Liberians, like the rest of you,\r\njoined the United Nations based on respect for the\r\nprinciple of equal rights and the self-determination of\r\npeoples. By equal rights, we pronounced the equality\r\nof cultural identity in a diverse world. We did not view\r\nequality in a context of numerical ratios, but by the\r\nintrinsic equality of the worth of human beings and the\r\nright to self-determination consistent with the cultural\r\nidentity and the value of a free people; a people free of\r\nthe imposition of a perceived superior moral value\r\nsystem, one based upon the narrow view of moral\r\nsuperiority and ethnocentrism.\r\nIn essence, we advocate the coexistence of\r\ncultural diversity based upon the principle of the right\r\nof self-determination. This cultural identity is\r\nembodied in the legal context of the modern nation-\r\nState; an entity that is disparate in geographical size,\r\npopulation, wealth, power and resources, but equal in\r\nthe right of a people to determine their fate.\r\nToday, there is the disparity of bigness; bigness as\r\nit relates to wealth, technology and military power; a\r\nbigness so overwhelming that its wealth, technological\r\nadvancement and military strength could, with ease,\r\nreduce poverty, eradicate disease, educate youths,\r\nprovide basic social services, combat AIDS and\r\nmalaria, care for refugees and provide security. Yet,\r\nthis bigness has been used to sustain disparities\r\nbetween the North and the South. Some have argued\r\nthat the poor must learn to pull themselves up by their\r\nown bootstraps, while others have urged the North to\r\nassist the South because the creation of viable markets\r\nwill serve the self-interest of the North. Yet, any realist\r\nwould easily tell you that no nation guided by the\r\nprinciple of competition would shun disparities.\r\nHowever, the South is so small compared to the\r\nbigness of the North. The disparities are exponential.\r\nRemoving the disparities, even if willed, would indeed\r\nrequire a miracle. What options exist? The first step\r\ncould be to end the debt burden, the bondage of the\r\npoor to the wealthy; a debt burden acquired out of\r\nloans given in the pursuit of influence in the cold war,\r\nand not in the interest of the borrower; a debt burden\r\nthat has denied little children food, education, health\r\ncare and jobs for their parents. The debt burden is a\r\nbondage that will continue to stifle the welfare of the\r\nSouth into the new millennium. We must, however,\r\ncommend those few States that have cancelled the\r\ndebts of the least developed States.\r\nWe must also intercede for the transfer of\r\ntechnology. The bold steps of humanity in the sphere of\r\nresearch were intended to liberate all of humanity from\r\nits backwardness. It was never intended to benefit only\r\na few or to separate humanity. Why are Nobel laureates\r\nhonoured? Is it not because of their dedicated services\r\nto humanity? A technology that liberates only the\r\nNorth and not the South is indeed a mixed blessing; it\r\nis a gun that has been used to both liberate and kill. Are\r\nwe condemned to be raw material suppliers in the new\r\nmillennium? Suppliers of goods, the prices of which\r\nare determined by the buyers and not the sellers? Shall\r\nwe continue to remain in a position where we cannot\r\nafford essential technology in the fields of medicine\r\nand agriculture? We call not for the erasure of the\r\ndisparities created by the buyers of the North, but to\r\nhave access at the baseline, to engage in more equitable\r\nterms of trade.\r\nBigness is further expressed in the information\r\nexchange between the North and South. The Western\r\npress, with its domination of satellite transmission of\r\ninformation and access to the Internet, can through\r\nsheer exposure destroy small States incapable of\r\nmustering the resources to respond to a global public\r\nrelations campaign. The depiction of other cultures of\r\nsmall States is prejudiced by stereotypical portrayals of\r\na hopeless southern hemisphere; a hemisphere\r\nprejudiced by the lack of understanding and\r\ninformation, racism and ethnocentrism. The bigness of\r\nthe Western media and its impact on small States, on\r\ndifferent cultures, is so profound that it threatens their\r\nvery existence and welfare. And yet, because of their\r\npowerful influence, Governments succumb to them,\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nrather than regulate them; sometimes even using them\r\nas instruments of their foreign policy.\r\nWho do we raise these concerns with today? Who\r\nshall guarantee the conditions upon which we\r\ncollectively agreed to associate as a community of\r\nuniversal norms? What is the fate of our community in\r\nthis post-cold-war unipolar system? Should we be\r\nguarded by the words of the United States scholar\r\nGeorge F. Kennan, when he wrote in 1948 that:\r\n“We have 50 per cent of the world’s wealth, but\r\nonly 6.3 per cent of its population ... In this\r\nsituation we cannot fail to be the object of envy\r\nand resentment. Our real task in the coming\r\nperiod is to devise a pattern of relationships that\r\nwill allow us to maintain this position of\r\ndisparity ... We should cease to talk about the\r\nraising of the living standards and\r\ndemocratization. The day is not far off when we\r\nare going to have to deal in straight power\r\nconcepts.”\r\nLikewise, in 1996 at the United States\r\nDemocratic National Convention, James Rubin said,\r\n“The United Nations can only do what the United\r\nStates will let it do.”\r\nPerhaps the former Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, did take a\r\ncue when he asked the question:\r\n“How can we ask nations to accept democratic\r\npractice within their borders if they see no hope\r\nfor democracy among nations?”\r\nOr shall we be optimistic at the new wave of\r\nhumanism characterized by a global coalition for the\r\nprotection of human rights? Optimism must be based\r\nupon sincerity. Immanuel Kant would insist that the\r\nmoral imperative must be categorical and not\r\nhypothetical. Our actions cannot be predicated by mere\r\nexpediency in the calculation of accrued benefit; rather,\r\nour actions must be done because we perceive and\r\nknow them to be right.\r\nAt this juncture, this new millennium, we must\r\ndefend and preserve the universal truths to which we\r\nhave committed our common association. Truths are\r\nsimple and self-evident. If we must succeed in\r\npreserving the integrity of the United Nations, then we\r\nmust reject the inequitable representation of the\r\nworld’s people as reflected by the present structure of\r\nthe Security Council; reject the undemocratic processes\r\nof decision-making in the Security Council; and reject\r\nthe continuous violation of the United Nations Charter\r\nby the powerful. If we fail to make these rejections a\r\nreality in this millennium, then let us agree that all the\r\ntalk of moral imperatives and human rights is but mere\r\npolitical expediency.\r\nNevertheless, we the free people of the world will\r\nalways insist, as the American jurist Learned Hand did,\r\nthat:\r\n“Right knows no boundaries, and justice no\r\nfrontiers; the brotherhood of man is not a\r\ndomestic institution.”\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): The\r\nAssembly will now head an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Charles Gomis, Minister for External Relations of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire.\r\nMr. Gomis (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): At\r\nthe outset, I wish to commend the excellent idea of\r\nhaving this important Millennium Summit co-chaired\r\nby the representatives of two countries, friends of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Namibia and Finland, which play a decisive\r\nrole in the fight for the implementation and the respect\r\nof the fundamental principles of the United Nations.\r\nI wish to assure them of the full support of the\r\ndelegation of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nI also wish to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the United Nations Secretary-General for\r\nhis brilliant report, which will enable us to conduct a\r\nfruitful reflection aimed at rendering our Organization\r\nbetter able to respond to peoples’ expectations.\r\nIn appointing me to represent him at this\r\nMillennium Summit, the President of the Republic of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, General Robert Guéi, asked me to say\r\nfrom this rostrum how sorry he was to be unable to be\r\npresent, being detained by preparations for October’s\r\nelections.\r\nUnder these solemn circumstances, I wish to\r\nexpress on behalf of its Government and people Côte\r\nd’Ivoire’s attachment to the universal principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and its desire to contribute to\r\nstrengthening them.\r\nWe are witnessing an extraordinary acceleration\r\nin the world’s development. Peoples are demanding\r\ngreater well-being, happiness and, above all, freedom.\r\nIn that spirit, the developing countries in general, and\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nthose of Africa in particular, wish to see this Summit\r\nmake resolute commitments to the eradication of\r\npoverty, the right to development and the flourishing of\r\nthe human person.\r\nThat is why we welcome the importance given to\r\nthe situation in Africa in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. We sincerely hope that the appeal on behalf of\r\nthe African continent will be favourably received by\r\nthe international community. My country is one of\r\nthose which are convinced that most of the problems of\r\nthe developing countries are due to poverty and\r\ndestitution. In areas as important as agriculture,\r\neducation, health and training, these countries face\r\nobstacles which impede their development. To these\r\nare added the difficulties of exploiting and managing\r\ntheir immense natural resources, because they lack the\r\nnecessary techniques and technology, and, above all,\r\nbecause they have little weight in decision-making in\r\nfinance and international trade.\r\nHow, then, can we explain the fact that countries\r\nwith potential of all types are languishing in misery\r\nand ignorance while others lacking such resources are\r\nliving in abundance? We believe that a just and\r\nequitable management of world affairs, supported by\r\ndynamic and active solidarity, would contribute to\r\nreducing the gap between the rich and the poor\r\ncountries.\r\nAt this beginning of the third millennium, the\r\nUnited Nations must cease being purely an\r\nadministrative institution and become a centre of\r\nmorality and justice where all the nations of the world\r\nfeel at home, developing a common conscience by\r\nbeing a family of nations. The United Nations of the\r\ntwenty-first century has the historic duty of\r\nencouraging this qualitative step of active solidarity,\r\nnot only as an effective centre for mediation, but also\r\nby promoting values, attitudes and specific initiatives\r\nof solidarity capable of improving inter-State relations.\r\nOur shared Organization must therefore promote\r\nand encourage the political will for the ideas in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report to be quickly implemented\r\non the ground. But, for the United Nations to be truly\r\neffective, it must have the means to meet the many\r\nchallenges which it faces.\r\nThis is the model of the United Nations that we\r\nmust reassert and bring about, adapting it as necessary\r\nto take account of the changes which have occurred\r\nsince its establishment in particular the access of so\r\nmany new peoples to the experience of freedom, and\r\ntheir legitimate aspiration to be present, and to carry\r\nmore weight on the international scene.\r\nBy committing ourselves in that way, we will be\r\nable to overcome the problems which assail us,\r\nwhether they concern respect for the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter, reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, globalization, peacekeeping operations, good\r\ngovernance, debt, the environment, the advancement of\r\nwomen, human rights or the AIDS pandemic, to\r\nmention but a few.\r\nThe time has come for a new experience; we are\r\ninvited to guarantee the future of the women and men\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to take this opportunity\r\nto recall that following the change which occurred on\r\n24 December 1999 Côte d’Ivoire now has a new\r\nConstitution, broadly inspired by the fundamental\r\nvalues and principles of the Charter. This new\r\nConstitution, we are convinced, will permit\r\nconsiderable progress in democracy in our country. The\r\ngeneral elections to be held soon will mark the return\r\nto a civilian regime and democratic normality.\r\nWe sincerely thank friendly countries and the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as its institutions and\r\nspecialized agencies, for their significant assistance in\r\nthe electoral process in Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill next hear an address by His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Kikwete (United Republic of Tanzania): I\r\napologize on behalf of my President for his absence\r\nfrom this historic event. He would have liked to be\r\nhere, but he could not be present because of\r\nunavoidable national commitments.\r\nTanzania considers this Summit to be the new\r\nfoundation for a renewed international commitment to\r\nthe ideals, promise and vision of a twenty-first century\r\nUnited Nations. In its 55 years’ existence, the United\r\nNations has lived its mission and vision. Our\r\nOrganization was created essentially for the\r\nmaintenance of world peace and security. It is\r\nremarkable that since the end of the Second World War\r\nthe world has not experienced another world war, and\r\nhopefully it never will again. The United Nations has\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nbeen able to intervene and resolve a number of wars\r\nand conflicts which have threatened global and\r\nregional, as well as individual nations’, peace and\r\nsecurity. I wonder what the situation of the world\r\nwould have been without the United Nations.\r\nWhile the United Nations has scored noticeable\r\nsuccess in the area of peace and security, much more\r\nwork needs to be done in the field of the prevention\r\nand resolution of conflicts and wars. The existence of\r\nhuge arsenals of nuclear weapons poses a major\r\npotential threat to world peace and security. This has to\r\nbe eliminated for the sake of humanity. The United\r\nNations also needs to deal with the problem of the\r\nillicit traffic and proliferation of small arms. Tanzania\r\nis of the view that for greater success and effectiveness\r\nin dealing with conflicts, the United Nations needs to\r\nwork in close collaboration with regional mechanisms\r\nand initiatives.\r\nThe promotion of human rights, as well as social\r\nand economic development among nations and peoples\r\nof the world, was another important objective of the\r\nUnited Nations. Today, apart from a few enclaves of\r\nNon-Self-Governing Territories, the world is virtually\r\nfree from classical colonialism, and this is one of the\r\nachievements of the United Nations. The United\r\nNations also has to continue the promotion of, and\r\nadvocacy for, the observance of fundamental human\r\nrights, as it has done over the years. We believe that\r\nrespect for human rights forms a firm basis for peace,\r\nsecurity and development in societies and nations.\r\nThere is a need for the United Nations to be more\r\ninvolved in matters relating to social and economic\r\ndevelopment. Tackling the problems of poverty,\r\nespecially in Africa and the least developed countries,\r\nneeds to be given top priority. Perhaps nowhere is the\r\nproblem more compelling than in Africa, where 33 of\r\nthe 48 poorest countries in the world are located. It is\r\nno accident that the overriding development objective\r\nof Africa remains the eradication of poverty, ignorance\r\nand disease.\r\nThe United Nations urgently needs to do much\r\nmore in combating HIV/AIDS in Africa. Otherwise,\r\nuntold misery is bound to result.\r\nThe United Nations has always been a good\r\nadvocate for the poor and the weak in their quest for\r\nmeaningful development. We recall the numerous\r\ninitiatives made by the United Nations in attempting to\r\ncreate a new international economic order and make\r\nthe international community respond positively to the\r\nplight of the poor. Our Organization has to do that\r\nmore forcefully now than ever before because of the\r\nobvious challenges ahead of us. There were\r\nexpectations that globalization and liberalization would\r\nlead to increased growth and development, but they\r\nhave yet to produce tangible results for developing\r\ncountries. It is recognized that there are opportunities\r\nin globalization and liberalization, but the majority of\r\nthe developing countries are still marginalized because\r\nof their weakness, as well as the lack of an\r\ninternational environment conducive to development.\r\nThe specific challenges facing developing\r\ncountries in this regard deserve special attention. The\r\nUnited Nations must help promote measures that would\r\nencourage increased technical assistance and a greater\r\nflow of resources and investment from developed to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThere is also an urgent need for the United\r\nNations to help with comprehensive debt relief\r\nmeasures, particularly for the least developed\r\ncountries. We welcome the awareness of the\r\ninternational community of the need to address this\r\nissue.\r\nFurthermore, we expect the United Nations to\r\ncontinue to call upon the developed countries to\r\nprovide unhindered market access for goods from\r\ndeveloping countries, as well as to make technology\r\navailable to developing countries on a concessional and\r\ngrant basis.\r\nThe United Nations is as relevant today as it was\r\n55 years ago. The world still needs the United Nations,\r\nbut for the United Nations to perform its mission and\r\nrealize its vision, it has to be strengthened in its\r\nstructure and resources. There is a need, therefore, to\r\naddress the serious financial problems affecting the\r\nUnited Nations budget and the financing of the United\r\nNations development programmes. In this regard, I\r\ntake this opportunity to call upon Member States to pay\r\ntheir contributions to the United Nations in a timely\r\nfashion, without any conditionalities.\r\nIn conclusion, it is our view that the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is long overdue. The Council’s\r\ncontinued legitimacy demands that it be urgently\r\ndemocratized through the equitable representation of\r\ndeveloping countries in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories of membership. We also share the\r\nview that the expansion of the Council should include\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nboth developed and developing countries. I believe that\r\nthat would make the United Nations truly our\r\nOrganization. At present, it leaves much to be desired;\r\nthere is much that needs to be done if we are to have an\r\nOrganization that we can truly say belongs to all of us.\r\nI wanted to share those few thoughts as part of\r\nthis important millennium meeting of the United\r\nNations at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Antoine Kolawolé Idji, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Benin.\r\nMr. Idji (Benin) (spoke in French): I should like\r\nat the outset to pay tribute to the memory of the\r\ninternational staff members who recently perished in\r\nWest Timor in the service of the mission entrusted to\r\nthem by the international community.\r\nThe fact that our work is being guided by two\r\neminent personalities from Africa and Europe attests,\r\nin a symbolic fashion, to the international community’s\r\nsupport for the idea that there is a need to pool our\r\nefforts to define a shared vision of our common destiny\r\nand to commit ourselves to a compact of solidarity.\r\nThat is why I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute\r\nto Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization, and to congratulate him on the report that\r\nhe submitted for our consideration, entitled “We the\r\npeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century”. His judicious and clear-sighted analysis,\r\nas well as his well-founded recommendations, once\r\nagain bear witness to his commitment and aspiration to\r\nmake the Organization an effective instrument,\r\ncommensurate with our aspirations, that can meet the\r\nchallenges confronting our peoples.\r\nMore than 50 years after the creation of the\r\nUnited Nations — and thanks to its actions — the\r\nworld can be proud of having spared itself a repetition\r\nof the conflicts on the scale of those that characterized\r\nthe first half of the twenty-first century. However,\r\nparadoxically, it has not been able to protect itself from\r\nthe advent of an even more terrifying threat: the\r\npotential for mass destruction, acquired by certain\r\ncountries, which is capable of wiping out all of\r\nhumanity and our shared home, the earth.\r\nThe United Nations has also done significant\r\nwork to emancipate peoples from the colonial yoke,\r\nand today the international community can legitimately\r\nwelcome that. However, the Organization’s initiatives\r\nto support the majority of these countries that are new\r\nto the international scene are still very flimsy and have\r\nexperienced vicissitudes, often disappointing the hopes\r\nthat they had inspired.\r\nSince 1997, the Organization has been\r\nundertaking an internal process of reform required by\r\nthe new global context so as to make it more capable of\r\nmeeting these new challenges. The initial results of this\r\narduous and painstaking process are encouraging and\r\nreaffirm the need to continue.\r\nWe shall not repeat what the Secretary-General\r\nhas already said so well in his report. We shall limit our\r\nremarks to the role that the people of Benin hope to see\r\nthe United Nations play in the twenty-first century. The\r\nUnited Nations has always been viewed by our people\r\nas the most appropriate and promising instrument for\r\nsetting out the major guidelines for building a human\r\ncommunity that is prosperous and safe. But beyond that\r\nlegitimate concern, the men and women of Benin are\r\nrightly asking questions about the form that\r\nsafeguarding peace and security in the world will take,\r\nand about development and the specific signs of\r\ncooperation and solidarity that will make it possible to\r\nraise their standard of living and to achieve what we in\r\nBenin call the minimum shared social living\r\nstandard — that is, access for every human being,\r\nwherever he or she may be on our planet, to food,\r\nhousing, clothing, medical attention, education and\r\nuseful economic work for society in an environment\r\nconducive to income-producing activity. These, to be\r\nsure, are objectives to which the United Nations, since\r\nits inception, has dedicated considerable resources\r\nthrough numerous initiatives.\r\nIt must be recognized, however, that as of now all\r\nof the plans and programmes drawn up over more than\r\n50 years have not been able to reduce poverty, much\r\nless to stimulate genuine development in those\r\ncountries that we continue, with such old-fashioned\r\nmodesty, to call “developing countries”.\r\nEven more than in the past, the credibility of the\r\nOrganization henceforth will be measured in terms of\r\nits capacity to place human beings and the protection\r\nof human dignity at the centre of its activities.\r\nThere is a need to act rapidly to remedy the\r\nnegative impacts of the globalization of the economy\r\nand of communications, and a need to fill the huge and\r\nunjust gap that has developed between those who have\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\naccess to the potential that technological progress is\r\nmaking available and those who are deprived of or\r\nexcluded from it.\r\nThe economy and means of communication are\r\nnow globalized, but what is now needed is to globalize\r\ndevelopment by mobilizing the international\r\ncommunity to shoulder shared but differentiated\r\nresponsibility and by effectively creating improved\r\nsocio-economic conditions likely to promote the full\r\nflourishing of the human being.\r\nWe have a historic responsibility to update and\r\nextend the vision of the founding fathers of our\r\nuniversal Organization.\r\nOnce again, we must be capable of imagination\r\nand vision and must give thought to posterity.\r\nIn this context, we believe that in the twenty-first\r\ncentury the United Nations should base its action on\r\ncollective responsibility; the right to equally shared\r\ndevelopment and progress; and the universally\r\naccepted duty of solidarity. The enjoyment of these\r\nthree fundamental values by the citizens of the world\r\nrequires the strengthening of genuine partnership\r\nbetween the three protagonists of international life,\r\nnamely, Governments, civil society and the private\r\nsector.\r\nIt is at this price that the imperative needs of\r\ndemocracy, the primacy of law and good governance\r\nwill be advanced and consolidated at the national,\r\nregional and international level.\r\nI conclude by referring to the symbol of the\r\npierced jar, taken from the history of Benin in the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\nKing Guezo, who reigned in Abomey from 1818\r\nto 1858, faced with the difficulties inherent in his\r\nposition, bequeathed us these prophetic words, which\r\ntoday have inspired many mottos: “If all the sons of the\r\nKingdom were to come and with all their hands\r\ntogether stop up the holes of the pierced jar, the\r\ncountry would be saved.”\r\nThe people of Benin have resorted to the\r\nsymbolism of the pierced jar each time it has found\r\nitself at a crossroads, faced with the challenges and the\r\nproblems of its destiny.\r\nThe conference of vital forces of the nation, held\r\nin Cotonou from 19 to 28 February 1990, where\r\nrepresentatives of all regions of the country and all\r\nsectors of national life were together at a time when\r\ngreat dangers were threatening our very existence, is a\r\nrecent and historic illustration of that.\r\nThe contribution of Benin to defining the new\r\nvision of the United Nations for the twenty-first\r\ncentury could be formulated around this symbol, which\r\ncalls for solidarity, tolerance, sharing, commitment,\r\nsocial progress and development, all of them values\r\nthat sum up my thoughts here and that are all to be\r\nfound in those famous words bequeathed to posterity\r\nby King Guezo.\r\nIt is on these various pillars that renewed United\r\nNations action must be based. On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I ask all the inhabitants of the planet earth\r\nto support that jar, which today symbolizes our world,\r\nso that it will never break into pieces in our hands,\r\nwhich must protect it for the generations to come.\r\nLong live the renewed United Nations so that,\r\nthroughout this millennium, the planet earth, which we\r\nhave been given to share, will know peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): I now call on\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jeremiah Manele, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Manele (Solomon Islands): I have the\r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Prime\r\nMinister of Solomon Islands, The Honourable\r\nManasseh Sogavare.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity must remain a major role for the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century. The world entered\r\nthe new millennium with increasing conflicts, in\r\nparticular internal conflicts and wars. My country has\r\nfallen victim to this trend. The crisis of the past 20\r\nmonths has tested the solidarity, security and stability\r\nof our young country. It has exposed the real\r\nchallenges of ethnic differences that exist and can\r\npersist in a culturally rich and diverse society such as\r\nours. To resolve the crisis, my Government has\r\nlaunched a National Peace Plan and a Programme of\r\nAction aimed at achieving a peaceful solution to the\r\nunrest through meaningful dialogue and discussion and\r\nat developing the country on the basis of a number of\r\nprinciples, including the rule of law; equitable sharing\r\nand active participation by our people in the\r\nsustainable development of our national resources;\r\nrespect for human rights; promotion of and respect for\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nour different cultural traditions; and a gender-balanced\r\napproach to education and employment.\r\nA ceasefire agreement was signed by the\r\nconflicting parties on 3 August 2000. The agreement\r\nprovides a conducive environment for peace talks to\r\nproceed. Preliminary peace negotiations have been\r\nundertaken, and the actual peace talks are currently\r\nunder way. My Government is therefore firmly\r\ncommitted to ensuring peace and security for all our\r\ncitizens, foreign friends and visitors. We are equally\r\ndetermined to rebuild our economy and welcome those\r\nwho wish to assist in this endeavour. In this regard,\r\nmay I call on our development partners to adopt a more\r\npositive attitude towards my Government’s genuine\r\nattempts to restore law and order, thus ensuring peace,\r\nsecurity, and stability. During this difficult period,\r\nSolomon Islands, where appropriate, needs your\r\nassistance.\r\nWhile access to information technology could be\r\nthe most rapid means to utilize the benefits of\r\nglobalization and to reduce the development gap\r\nbetween developed and developing countries, for least\r\ndeveloped countries the process must begin with\r\ninfrastructure development. Of particular importance is\r\nthe development of a reliable and efficient energy\r\nsector. Without electricity, access to information and\r\ncommunication technology will remain a distant\r\npossibility for our rural communities. The need for\r\nintellectual capacity to harness the opportunities of the\r\ninformation age is a key prerequisite for closing the\r\ndigital divide. Education, including the eradication of\r\nilliteracy, therefore remains a priority for Solomon\r\nIslands.\r\nSolomon Islands joins those who spoke earlier in\r\nstressing the importance of sustaining the future of our\r\nplanet. Agenda 21 and the related international\r\nprogrammes of action and conventions remain valid\r\nblueprints for sustainable development and\r\nenvironmental management in the twenty-first century.\r\nWe fully endorse the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations on how to address the issues of\r\nclimate change and environmental degradation,\r\nincluding marine pollution. We must not take for\r\ngranted the concerns and needs of the most vulnerable\r\nMembers of our Organization, the small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nOnly a reformed, inclusive and universal United\r\nNations can effectively shoulder the major\r\nresponsibilities placed on it. Flexibility and greater\r\nunderstanding should be demonstrated towards those\r\nwho wish to participate in the work and activities of\r\nour Organization. The Republic of China on Taiwan is\r\na case in point. As well, those Member States that are\r\ncapable and prepared to play a greater role in the\r\nSecurity Council, including Germany and Japan,\r\nshould be accorded permanent membership. Concrete\r\nefforts should now be made on reaching agreement on\r\nthe outstanding issues of Security Council reform.\r\nFinally, we have just parted from a century of\r\nsorrow that saw two World Wars, one of which affected\r\nour islands, and countless other conflicts causing\r\nsorrow and suffering — a century defined by a culture\r\nof violence and intolerance. As we begin the twenty-\r\nfirst century, let us work towards making it a century of\r\nharmony, a century defined by a culture of peace and\r\ntolerance, dialogue and discussion, and prosperity for\r\nall of humanity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Claude\r\nMorel, Chairman of the delegation of Seychelles.\r\nMr. Morel (Seychelles): My delegation\r\ncongratulates the Co-Chairpersons for their dynamic\r\nstewardship of this auspicious and historic Summit\r\nmeeting of the United Nations. Our felicitations also go\r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\r\ncommendable report before us, and for initiating\r\nreform measures to revitalize the United Nations\r\nsystem as we embrace the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nRevitalizing the United Nations would require\r\nproviding it with the effective instruments needed to\r\npursue its noble objectives. This entails ensuring that it\r\nis endowed with the required resources to carry out its\r\nmandates, in particular those of promoting economic\r\nand social progress. This also entails reinforcing the\r\npresent mechanisms in place for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace, security and disarmament,\r\nincluding the United Nations role in peace-making and\r\npeacekeeping activities. It also entails strengthening its\r\nvocation as an indispensable instrument for a more\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world.\r\nThe reform process would be inadequate if the\r\ntransformation of the Security Council into a\r\ndemocratic and representative organ reflecting both its\r\nuniversal character and present-day realities were not\r\nachieved. After seven years of debate, it is of\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nimperative necessity to bridge positions and make\r\nprogress.\r\nEqually important for my delegation is that the\r\nreform process should encompass the enhancement of\r\nthe General Assembly as the supreme policy-making\r\norgan of the United Nations. It is only through the\r\nreinforcement of its role and mandate that the\r\ninternational community can successfully tackle some\r\nof the most pressing issues facing humanity, not least\r\nof which is the process of globalization.\r\nGlobalization has provided many countries,\r\nespecially the strong economies of the North, with\r\nunprecedented opportunities and benefits. However, it\r\nhas also accentuated the North-South divide, and has\r\nexposed the smaller and most vulnerable economies to\r\nmarginalization. My delegation believes that the key to\r\nredressing the unequal impact of globalization is to\r\nstrengthen multilateral action and reinforce the United\r\nNations system in its commitment to international\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation holds the view that\r\nthere should be even closer collaboration and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations system, the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization in addressing the crucial question of\r\ndevelopment. Next year’s United Nations conference\r\non financing for development will be a test case for\r\ninternational solidarity. It is my delegation’s hope that\r\nthe conference will result in a new, genuine and\r\nmeaningful global partnership for development.\r\nThat partnership should be extended to the area of\r\ninternational trade, since in the long term we\r\ndeveloping countries can only finance our development\r\nneeds by gaining greater market access and better\r\nprices for our exports. Of critical importance to us is\r\nthe need for the extension of trade preferences for a\r\nlonger period of time, in order to facilitate our\r\nintegration into the international trading system and\r\nensure that we can also be the beneficiaries of\r\nglobalization, not its victims.\r\nThe post-cold-war period has not delivered the\r\npromised peace dividend. The hopes and expectations\r\nof the developing world, as raised by the United\r\nNations global conferences of the past decade, have not\r\nbeen met. Instead, we have witnessed a weakening of\r\nthe commitment of the countries of the North to\r\nsupport development. More than ever before, we are\r\ntoday living in an interdependent world. The developed\r\nnations therefore have a responsibility to engage with\r\nus so as to deal with the major global, economic, social\r\nand environmental challenges of our time on the basis\r\nof understanding and genuine partnership among\r\nequals.\r\nThat responsibility should include, inter alia,\r\naccepting the vulnerabilities and special needs of small\r\nisland developing States and fully implementing the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action and the decisions of\r\nthe twenty-second special session of the General\r\nAssembly; accepting that the per capita gross domestic\r\nproduct of small island developing States should not be\r\nthe major criterion in assessing their development\r\nneeds; accepting that climate change is a direct\r\nconsequence of unsustainable development policies of\r\nthe North; accepting that the debt and debt-servicing\r\nburden of countries of the South is a principal cause of\r\neconomic stagnation and underdevelopment; accepting\r\nthat there is a need to elaborate a comprehensive\r\nstrategy to promote increased access to science and\r\ntechnology by developing nations; and accepting that it\r\nis unjust for a small percentage of humanity to\r\nconsume an overwhelming share of the world’s\r\nresources.\r\nThe evolution in international relations has\r\nbrought about new realities in the global order. The\r\nMillennium Summit is therefore a timely occasion for\r\nthe entire membership of the United Nations to reflect\r\nupon the articulation of our vision and aspirations of\r\nthe United Nations in the twenty-first century, and to\r\nelaborate fresh approaches to deal with the challenges\r\nof our time. The United Nations is not a perfect\r\ninstitution. But it is the only institution that represents\r\nthe collective conscience of humanity. It remains our\r\ngreatest hope for justice, peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. It remains our only hope for a more\r\ncompassionate world.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an Address by His Royal Highness\r\nPrince Moulay Rachid, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nMorocco.\r\nPrince Moulay Rachid (Morocco) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I have the great honour to convey to the\r\nmembers of the Assembly the greetings and high\r\nesteem of His Majesty Mohammed VI, King of\r\nMorocco. He has asked me to communicate on his\r\nbehalf the royal message, which he should have liked\r\n36\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nto deliver personally before this Millennium Summit,\r\ngiven the special interest he attaches to it.\r\nFollowing is the text of the royal message:\r\n“At the outset, on this rare and\r\nextraordinary occasion, I wish to thank all of\r\nthose who have contributed to organizing this\r\nMillennium Summit. I should like in particular to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, who has\r\nconvened this Summit so that, together, we may\r\ntake stock of the world situation in the context of\r\nan ambitious and bold vision for the future of\r\nhumanity.\r\n“During the century that is now ending, the\r\nworld has known the best and the worst. It has\r\nbenefited from unprecedented breakthroughs in\r\nthe fields of science, technology and global\r\ncommunications, but it has also endured a heavy\r\ntoll of lethal wars, totalitarian regimes and major\r\nupheavals. Today, with the confluence of ideas\r\nemerging throughout the world on the supremacy\r\nof law and the democratic ideal, we have the\r\nopportunity to spare future generations the\r\nscourges of horror and inequality experienced in\r\nthe last century and thus to put an end to the\r\nunbroken chain of misery, ignorance and\r\nexclusion. We, the heads of State and\r\nGovernment, have a duty at this historic event to\r\nmake a solemn commitment as we enter the new\r\nmillennium to open up a new frontier for\r\nhumanity, with real justice and compassion in\r\nsolidarity.\r\n“This new frontier for humanity is based\r\nprimarily on a concept of global human security,\r\nwhich means that no child anywhere will die of\r\nhunger; pandemics will not spread; ethnic tension\r\nwill not erupt into violence; women will not be\r\nvictimized by discrimination or violations of their\r\ndignity; the right of free expression will not be\r\nstifled; immigrants will not suffer exclusion;\r\npeople will not be deprived of education; water\r\nboundaries will not lead to conflict; and sanctions\r\nwill not unduly and unjustly penalize innocent\r\npopulations.\r\n“This new frontier is also based on strategic\r\nand institutional coherence, because local\r\ngovernance can fully succeed only in the context\r\nof true international democracy animated by a\r\nsuccessful United Nations system and with\r\nhuman and financial resources that are adequate\r\nto the global mandates entrusted to the various\r\nagencies. In this respect, it will be necessary in\r\ndue course to reform the United Nations Charter,\r\nupdating some of its obsolete provisions while\r\npreserving the universal principles that prevailed\r\nin the founding of a unique Organization which is\r\ncalled on to play a lead role in the\r\nmacromanagement of world problems.\r\n“It is also necessary to take advantage of the\r\npolitical impulse of this Summit to promote the\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council in order to\r\nallow that most important organ better to reflect\r\nthe new world political architecture, taking\r\naccount of the need for impartiality, effectiveness,\r\nrepresentativeness and irrefutable legitimacy. We\r\nmust recall that, since the most recent reform in\r\n1963, the number of United Nations Member\r\nStates has grown by two thirds. It is therefore\r\ntime to expand the representation of the\r\ndeveloping world on the Council, attaching\r\npriority to the criteria of effective commitment to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\n“The so-called ‘digital divide’ can be\r\nreduced only through a technological democracy\r\nthat recognizes the right to universal access to\r\ninformation technology as a global public right.\r\n“Finally, we strongly believe that an\r\ninternational order of justice and equity must\r\nredress the distortions in the world economy,\r\nreduce the harmful effects of speculative financial\r\nflows and act more decisively against the social\r\nand regional imbalances throughout the world. In\r\nthis context, I should like to recall the appeal\r\nmade on the occasion of the establishment of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994 by my\r\nfather, King Hassan II, in calling for the\r\nimplementation of multilateral global governance,\r\ntaking into particular account the enhanced\r\ncoordination of the activities of the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the WTO.\r\n“The available indicators and statistics and\r\nthe anachronistic trends that characterize the\r\nstructure of the world economy prove that it is\r\nalso imperative to find new sources of financing\r\nfor sustainable development if we do not wish to\r\ncondemn broader segments of humanity to misery\r\n37\r\nA/55/PV.6\r\nwithout end or to generate global upheavals that\r\ncould wipe out recent achievements in\r\ninternational law and the relative attenuation of\r\nideological and geopolitical confrontations.\r\n“The special high-level session to be held\r\nnext year on a world partnership for development\r\nwill offer an exceptional opportunity to design\r\ninnovative formulas and to commit additional\r\nresources to the developing world, which has\r\nbeen caught in a vise between the constraints of\r\nthe donors and the indifference of investors. Such\r\nan initiative, in addition to being a founding act\r\nof multilateral diplomacy for the new generation,\r\nwould spark active solidarity among men and\r\nmark the birth of what I might call ‘planetary\r\npatriotism’. In that respect, the African continent,\r\nwhich has been marginalized in all sectors of\r\ninternational life, needs a multifaceted strategy\r\ninvolving a substantial reduction of its external\r\ndebt; the elimination of protectionist barriers that\r\npenalize its products, which are already\r\nundervalued and poorly remunerated; the\r\nestablishment of adjustment programmes that are\r\ncompatible with the abatement of its conflicts and\r\nan accelerated development of its human\r\nresources; technological transfers adapted to its\r\nspecific needs; and adequately structured\r\nfinancial assistance.\r\n“In that capacity, the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nproposes that the United Nations establish a\r\nstanding high-level mechanism to implement the\r\ndecisions of the international community for\r\nAfrica.”\r\nWe thank you for your kind attention and express\r\nour best wishes for the success of this Millennium\r\nSummit, to which our Secretary-General, as well as the\r\ninternational civil servants as a whole, together with\r\nthe Non-Governmental Organizations Forum, have\r\ndevoted the best of their talents and energies.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.15 p.m.\r\n"
