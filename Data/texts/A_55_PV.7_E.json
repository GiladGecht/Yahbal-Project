As we speak, despite the 50 years of\r\nexistence of the United Nations, the international\r\ncommunity still remains preoccupied with the same\r\nchronic concerns of survival and advancement \r\nobjectives that have always been the subjects of\r\nrecommendations, resolutions and decisions of\r\nvirtually all international meetings. Time and time\r\nagain, the adoption of resolutions and the successful\r\nattainment of objectives set continue to either elude us\r\nor yield only meagre reward for our efforts.\r\nThe convening of this Summit challenges us to\r\ntake far-reaching decisions relating specifically to the\r\nright to development, the fair and equitable\r\nparticipation of developing countries in globalization\r\nand liberalization, practical commitment to poverty\r\neradication, North-South technical and economic\r\ncooperation, and last but not least, the promotion and\r\npreservation of international peace and security. All\r\nthese are desirable and achievable objectives, provided\r\nwe are prepared to agree unreservedly to commit\r\nourselves, our Governments and the required resources\r\nto their attainment.\r\nOur Organization enjoins us world leaders and\r\ncitizens to combine forces to bring about a brighter\r\nfuture for humankind by ushering in a more balanced\r\nand equitable world devoid of social injustice,\r\neconomic deprivation, hunger and diseases, as well as\r\nsenseless wars. This dream can only be realized\r\nthrough the establishment of permanent peace and\r\nsecurity across the globe. It is a fact that democracy,\r\nsocial development and justice can not take place in the\r\nabsence of peace.\r\nInternational peace and security can bring about\r\neconomic wonders around the world, especially in\r\nAfrica. But how do we bring about permanent global\r\npeace and security? This can be achieved only through\r\ntolerance, love and caring for each other. We must\r\nensure an equitable and a just distribution of the\r\nworlds resources and wealth and inculcate the spirit of\r\ncaring and sharing to replace the present world\r\neconomic order. We must replace the rationale of\r\nsuper profit-making with the rationale of super\r\nwelfare or super humanity to bring about the narrowing\r\nof the gap between the rich and poor nations of our\r\nglobal village.\r\nThe present imbalances and lack of fair\r\nadjustments in our participation in the process of\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nglobalization should also be addressed so as to enable\r\ndeveloping countries to take advantage of world\r\neconomic growth by mobilizing both domestic and\r\nexternal resources for sustained economic growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe promotion of peace and democratic values\r\nand principles is linked to the development of good\r\nrelations between Governments. It is for these reasons\r\nthat my Government considers the failure of the United\r\nNations to respect the dignity and rights of 23 million\r\nTaiwanese to membership in our esteemed\r\nOrganization as a serious setback to the professed\r\nuniversality of the United Nations and a gross\r\n`contradiction to the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. In like manner, the economic embargo on Cuba\r\nhas proven to be very counterproductive and it is my\r\nGovernments hope that the international communitys\r\nrecent change of attitude would usher in renewed\r\ncooperation and reconciliation with that great country.\r\nThe United Nations has immense potential to\r\nserve humanity well, within the framework of\r\nmultilateralism. Its effectiveness or failure depends\r\nentirely on Member States and what we make of it.\r\nIndeed, against the backdrop of fundamental changes in\r\nthe international scene, the reforms of the United\r\nNations system, especially reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, require urgent attention to ensure transparency\r\nand fairness, based on proportionate representation and\r\nsharing of responsibilities.\r\nThe United Nations should be the moral standard\r\nbearer of humankind, ensuring justice, equality, peace\r\nand stability around the world and among nations,\r\nirrespective of size, geographical location or economic\r\nstatus in the twenty-first century and beyond. It should\r\nbe a source of hope for the desperate and of solace and\r\nsuccour for the afflicted, and inspire confidence among\r\nthe downtrodden and destitute the world over. In this\r\nway the notion of We the Peoples will have relevance\r\nto our profession of faith in our common humanity.\r\nThen, and only then, can we claim the twenty-first\r\ncentury, strengthened in our resolve to make this planet\r\na better and more productive one where humankind can\r\nlive in dignity and peace.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Miguel\r\nÁngel Rodríguez Echeverría, President of the Republic\r\nof Costa Rica.\r\nPresident Rodríguez Echeverría (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We respond to the call of the United Nations\r\nto celebrate together the dawn of a new era, an era of\r\nprogress and hope for humanity.\r\nFrom the last century, we inherited innumerable\r\nachievements, but also grave shortcomings. Mankinds\r\nwork is unfinished.\r\nWe cannot allow ourselves to feel satisfied.\r\nUrgent challenges demand response. Costa Rica comes\r\nto this Millennium Assembly convinced that we must\r\nwork together to transform those challenges into the\r\nachievements of the new millennium.\r\nWe must not forget that 11 million girls and boys\r\nunder the age of 5 die annually due to preventable\r\ncauses. Over the last two years, Costa Rica was able to\r\nreduce infant mortality by 17 per cent, even though it\r\nhad a low rate to begin with. However, it is too small a\r\ncountry to save those millions of children who die;\r\n30,500 will die today. These deaths demand our\r\ncollective action.\r\nWe must not forget that 130 million girls and\r\nboys do not have access to primary education and that\r\ndue to gender inequality, millions of women see their\r\nright to education hampered. We have an illiteracy rate\r\nof only 4.4 per cent in Costa Rica and we are pleased\r\nto know that it is even lower among women. But we\r\nare a small country and there remains work to do.\r\nCreating a society of opportunities on the entire planet\r\nrequires the effort of all nations.\r\nWe must not forget the millions of lives lost in\r\nthe wars of the twentieth century. My country\r\neliminated the army more than half a century ago to\r\ninvest in education and health. Today our health system\r\nis better even than those of developed countries and we\r\nare the healthiest Latin American society, according to\r\nthe World Health Organization and The Economist.\r\nHowever, our country cannot contribute more so that\r\nthe billions of dollars spent on arms and armies be\r\nredirected to human development, as they should be.\r\nThat requires the commitment of all.\r\nWe must not ignore the damage caused to future\r\ngenerations by the levelling of thousands of square\r\nkilometres of the planets forests. Costa Rica is\r\ndeveloping a national pay system for environmental\r\nservices. However, to mitigate the effects of\r\ngreenhouse gases and to preserve our forests to the\r\nbenefit of humanity, the effective commitment of all is\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nrequired to create an international market for the sale\r\nof environmental services.\r\nKnowledge, information and access to the new\r\ntechnologies are key today to generating well-being.\r\nThe new frontiers today are technological. Thus, as we\r\ndid at the last session of the General Assembly, we\r\nagree with the need to motivate the massive\r\ndistribution of vaccines and medicine in the most\r\nneedy sectors of humanity, before Jeffrey Sachs\r\nfarsighted warning. This year we are united by the\r\ncommitment to reduce the digital divide so that\r\ninjustice and inequality do not increase. That was the\r\nwarning of the Holy See a few weeks ago. On that\r\nsame day, Costa Rica initiated the programme called\r\nCommunication without Borders, and it became the\r\nfirst country to offer free electronic mail to the entire\r\npopulation.\r\nWe must not forget the promotion of democratic\r\nvalues and human rights, deeply rooted in Costa Rican\r\ntradition. For that reason, we celebrate democratic\r\nconsolidation  due to recent elections led by brilliant\r\nGovernment statesmen, after long periods with the\r\nsame governing party  being enjoyed by Mexico and\r\nthe Republic of China in Taiwan, which deserves an\r\nappropriate place within international organizations.\r\nWe highlight the Secretary-Generals support for the\r\nUniversity of Peace to promote those values and we\r\nfirmly support its efforts for all countries to ratify the\r\nhuman right treaties, because enforcement and respect\r\nfor these should be limitless. In this new millennium of\r\nhope, the multilateral application of international law\r\nmust ensure, in addition to sovereignty, the\r\nenforcement of that law based in the dignity of the\r\nhuman being.\r\nToday the worlds poorest societies are\r\nexperiencing the serious consequences of the\r\nartificially driven increase in oil prices. On the\r\naverage, 77 million barrels of oil are consumed daily.\r\nGiven that its overpricing is close to $10 per barrel, at\r\nthe end of one year we would pay more than\r\n$280 billion in excess.\r\nWith that enormous amount of resources, 1,100\r\nmillion people could receive adequate health care.\r\nThus, the infant mortality could be reduced and\r\nlongevity could be increased. With those resources,\r\n28 million housing units could be built, or primary\r\neducation could be offered to 550 million girls and\r\nboys or secondary education could be offered to\r\n430 million youths.\r\nThis is the terrible cost in human terms of oil\r\noverpricing. This source of the impoverishment of\r\nmillions of people must be halted. Today, more than\r\never, we require the commitment of countries and\r\ninternational bodies on this issue that affects the right\r\nof all people to human development. For that reason, I\r\nappreciate the decision made by the Government of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela last night to support\r\nthe Central American and Caribbean countries, which\r\nwill be announced today by President Chávez.\r\nThe United Nations can and must respond to the\r\nchallenges of the new millennium with our political\r\nand material support. To eliminate war, we must\r\nrestructure the Security Council; to promote peace in\r\nterms of social justice, democracy and human\r\ndevelopment, the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme must be on an equal footing with the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nToday I ask the nations of the world to join\r\nefforts so that international solidarity will be the mark\r\nof our times; let every woman and man will feel like a\r\nmember of one race: the human race; and let there be\r\nonly one destiny: human development. Only in this\r\nmanner will this new era be an era of progress and\r\nhope for humanity.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Hugo Banzer Suarez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia.\r\nPresident Banzer Suárez (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMore than half a century ago, when the San Francisco\r\nCharter was signed, different times and other\r\ncircumstances reigned. A war that had shaken\r\nhumanity had ended. The maintenance of peace and\r\ninternational security constituted the essential objective\r\nof the United Nations. The political independence of\r\nnew States and the promotion of democratic values,\r\nrespect for humans rights and cooperation among the\r\npeoples were among its others goals. Disputes would\r\nhenceforth be resolved by peaceful means.\r\nThus an era of hope was ushered in. These\r\nobjectives and principles are still valid. However, the\r\nend of the confrontation between East and West did not\r\nbring substantial benefits in the economic field for the\r\nless developed countries. That conflict has been\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nreplaced by a sort of antagonism between North and\r\nSouth  in other words, between the economic Powers\r\nand the nations that are struggling to improve their\r\nlevels of growth.\r\nIt is certain that, in the period that began in 1945,\r\nthe much-feared nuclear war did not take place, and it\r\nis also certain that important opportunities for\r\ncooperation opened up. In this sphere, the United\r\nNations played an important role. Clearly, however,\r\ntensions persist with other characteristics, generated in\r\nessence by backwardness, poverty and inequalities,\r\nwhich have increased to a dangerous extent. Those\r\nfactors have determined new divisions affecting\r\ncontemporary society, which need urgent correction.\r\nThat is why we are gathered here today  to\r\nconsider a new agenda incorporating the current\r\nchallenges and preparing us adequately to meet\r\neffectively the challenges of the future. However, this\r\nMillennium Summit has to mean much more than that.\r\nIn my opinion, it is urgent that we reach\r\nagreements and assume commitments on a group of\r\nessential topics, because the millennium agenda cannot\r\nbe reduced to a mere wishlist of good proposals. It\r\nshould mean a major commitment of historical\r\nsignificance to leading our countries forward towards\r\nthe common destiny we all seek  a future built upon\r\nthe solid foundations of equity and justice, tolerance\r\nand dialogue, and respect for man, nature and the\r\nvalues of representative and participatory democracy; a\r\nfuture that would lead us to establish conditions that\r\nmitigate the inequalities, the origin of the conflicts of\r\nour times. For obvious reasons, I will touch on only\r\nsome aspects of the reflection that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has requested of us.\r\nThere is ultimately a close relationship between\r\nfreedom and poverty and between poverty and\r\nviolence. Nobody can call free human beings who live\r\nchained to the limitations that destitution imposes upon\r\nmillions of people. There can be neither economic nor\r\npolitical stability if we do not address social\r\nimbalances. Freedom is always threatened when\r\npoverty is present. We must balance the variety of\r\ninterests, within a framework of inclusive prosperity,\r\nbetween those who have more and those who can only\r\noffer their labour. These are the roots of current and\r\nfutures dangers.\r\nSocial demands are unquestionably legitimate.\r\nThe commitment to fighting against poverty must be\r\nmade under the principle of shared responsibility, as it\r\nis with the fight against the drug traffic, a field in\r\nwhich Bolivians have achieved spectacular results that\r\nare internationally recognized. According to the\r\nSecretary-Generals report, more than 1 billion people\r\nsubsist on less than $1 a day. In this era of knowledge,\r\nglobalization must become an instrument to fight that\r\npainful reality and not to exacerbate the crises, as has\r\nrecently happened.\r\nWe have a diagnosis of the problem that cannot\r\nbe contested on technical grounds. I would stress that\r\nwhat is lacking are agreements that allow the\r\npromotion of economic development based on an ethic\r\nof solidarity more universal, more equitable and less\r\nconcentrated and that distributes revenues in a better\r\nway. The shared responsibility that we propose has to\r\nbe expressed in a truly democratic form in the terms of\r\ntrade, where the economically large countries can\r\nclearly contribute in greater measure.\r\nIt is fundamental that, in a so-called open\r\neconomy, markets not be closed with discriminatory\r\nmeasures and protectionist criteria. It is essential that\r\ndifferentiated preferential treatment be applied and that\r\nspecial support be given so that countries with weak\r\ninstitutional structures can move ahead, as Bolivia has\r\ndone. Reforms are needed that will allow them to\r\nattract larger flows of capital. It is vital that debt-relief\r\nprogrammes be enacted to liberate many countries\r\nfrom the stranglehold of debt. Science and technology\r\ncannot become commodities for exclusion. They\r\nshould be the shared wealth of human development in\r\nall corners of the Earth.\r\nOnly thus we will better distribute economic and\r\npolitical power throughout the world, ensuring that big\r\nand small States alike are guided by the same agenda\r\non fundamental issues by means of a true democratic\r\nprocess in which the few may not dictate norms that\r\nthe rest have to accept. Only with this vision will we\r\ncarry through on the commitment that we have all\r\nundertaken at this Millennium Summit to respond to\r\nthe same ethical values in the certainty that there can\r\nbe no stable peace nor security in a world that is built\r\non the foundations of vast disparities.\r\nNow, the execution of such a great mandate\r\nrequires a strengthened institution. The role of United\r\nNations must therefore be given new impetus in the\r\nfinancing of development in order to balance its\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nresponsibilities with the objectives of peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nI hope that those who, 50 years from now, are to\r\nevaluate what we are doing today will confirm that we\r\nhad the capacity to adopt the correct decisions and the\r\nwill to apply them to the benefit of humanity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Emil\r\nConstantinescu, President of Romania.\r\nPresident Constantinescu (spoke in French):\r\nOur conference is called the Millennium Summit. We\r\nmay consider whether we ought, first, to attempt to\r\nsummarize the experience that mankind has\r\naccumulated over the course of the closing millennium\r\nor whether we ought to turn already to the new\r\nmillennium about to start. The historic period that is\r\ncoming to an end requires us to understand that the\r\nhope for an entirely innocent beginning at the threshold\r\nof the new millennium is as unfounded as the\r\nmillennial terror of total catastrophe. We should\r\nembrace in equal measure the certainties of continuity\r\nand aspiration to progress that the experience of a\r\nmillennium inspires.\r\nMankind has just reached a point in its history\r\nthat is not only critical, but full of hope. After the\r\ntragic experiences humanity underwent on a global\r\nscale during this past century, we are seeing the birth,\r\nfor the first time in history, of a universal culture of\r\npeace.\r\nAs a foundation of the culture of peace and\r\nguardian of equity, the United Nations has never ceased\r\nto play an essential role by putting its experience to\r\ngood use. That role makes the United Nations a key\r\nactor in building the future. The calling of the United\r\nNations is not just to be a body that manages spheres of\r\ninfluence. It was also conceived as a pragmatic\r\ninstitution and as an expression of a global vision. This\r\nphilosophy, formulated at the inception of both the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, is the basis of the\r\nOrganizations future projects.\r\nThe United Nations is an extremely important\r\nactor in managing globalization to make it a process\r\nthat provides maximum advantages, with as few\r\nnegative effects as possible, for the development of all\r\nthe worlds societies and cultures. The General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council should\r\ngive priority attention to the effects of globalization,\r\nfor public opinion could gradually become more hostile\r\nto it, and should develop fair common principles and\r\npractices to give globalization a framework for it to\r\nbring about the progress of all mankind.\r\nAs the current Chair of the Conference of New\r\nand Restored Democracies, Romania is directly\r\ninterested in developing efforts aimed at consolidating\r\ndemocracies. This year we initiated and supported at\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights a resolution entitled\r\nPromotion and consolidation of democracy. We\r\nwelcome the initiative of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary\r\nRobinson, in proposing a joint declaration opposing\r\ndiscrimination, racism and all forms of xenophobia.\r\nThe laws that govern our States are based on the\r\npresumption of innocence. Along the same lines, we\r\nneed to adopt a common code of conduct for cultures\r\nand peoples based on a presumption of goodwill.\r\nRomania also has profound respect for United Nations\r\naction aimed at avoiding, or at least restricting, armed\r\nconflict and at guaranteeing dignity and fundamental\r\nrights for every human being.\r\nRomania has unhesitatingly contributed to\r\npeacekeeping operations. Recently over 7,000 officers\r\nand policemen have been participating in United\r\nNations operations in Somalia, Angola, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and Kosovo. In the same spirit, we have\r\ndecided to provide additional concrete proof of our\r\ndesire to participate. I therefore announce, on behalf of\r\nthe Romanian Government, that we are ready to\r\nreconsider Romanias status with regard to the\r\nfinancing of United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nand voluntarily give up the reduction we have enjoyed\r\nas a member of group C.\r\nWe believe that this new stage in international\r\naffairs requires a new consensus, to make the Security\r\nCouncil more energetic and avoid stagnation. One\r\nmatter on which it seems to me agreement is already\r\npossible is the need to emphasize a preventive, not\r\nreactive, culture in the work of the United Nations, and\r\nparticularly the Security Council. As the future\r\nPresident-in-Office of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Romania will\r\nendeavour to promote the principles of such a culture\r\nof prevention, and will give continuous attention to\r\nharmonious and effective cooperation between the\r\nOSCE and the United Nations.\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nWe are firmly convinced that, united, the nations\r\nof the world can confidently look to a common future\r\nof peace and mutual respect, and that the United\r\nNations has both the calling and the capacity to give\r\ninstitutional form to this common hope for progress\r\nand human dignity that inspires us all.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Jorge\r\nBatlle Ibáñez, President of the Eastern Republic of\r\nUruguay.\r\nPresident Batlle Ibáñez (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nare here today to represent our peoples, 6 billion\r\nhuman beings. Without a doubt, we are all equal, but it\r\nis also true that we are all different. What unites us is\r\nwhat we all share, our natural rights, which can be\r\nsummed up by a simple rule that we often forget: do as\r\nyou would be done by.\r\nIn order to put that rule into practice, our\r\ncountry  Uruguay  has taken part in every\r\ninitiative throughout the twentieth century to organize\r\npeoples lives along the lines of peace and freedom. At\r\nThe Hague Peace Conference in 1906 we proposed\r\nmandatory arbitration as a means of settling disputes\r\nbetween nations. Later we became Members of the\r\nLeague of Nations. We were founding members of the\r\nUnited Nations, and took part in drafting the Charter as\r\npart of the core group of drafters. We were the first to\r\nadopt the compulsory jurisdiction of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. Since 1952 we have continuously\r\ntaken part in United Nations peacekeeping missions\r\nand operations.\r\nThe United Nations Charter contains irrefutable\r\npolitical wisdom. Our greatest challenge is to uphold\r\nthe Charter in good faith and without duplicity. If we\r\ndid so many of our problems would be diminished or\r\nwould perhaps even disappear altogether.\r\nMaintaining peace and reducing poverty are\r\nfundamental goals of the international community. But\r\nwar, violence and poverty are the effects of much more\r\ndeep-rooted causes. It is not just by addressing the\r\neffects that we will honour our commitments. It is\r\nessential to address their causes.\r\nFreedom is indivisible. There can be no political\r\nfreedom without all the other freedoms. Throughout\r\ntheir lives, human beings organize themselves into\r\nsocieties  forming families, ensuring the continuation\r\nof the species, giving their children shared moral\r\nvalues, and applying their energies and talents to many\r\ntypes of work. When this vital activity of the human\r\nfamily is thwarted because their fruits are not allowed\r\nto reach world markets, nations are weakened and\r\nimpoverished and become easy prey to demagogy, lies,\r\ninjustice and backwardness, and sink into violence, as\r\nwe saw in the course of the last century. That is why\r\none of the most important tasks of the United Nations\r\nin this millennium must be to guarantee our right to\r\ncreate and produce, as well as our right to offer and to\r\nsell our products. Free trade, about which so much has\r\nbeen said and so little done, is more necessary than\r\never for a planet made smaller and much more\r\ninterdependent by globalization.\r\nOur region, America, including Uruguay, has\r\nalready undergone a period of globalization during the\r\nso-called Atlantic civilization, in the second half of the\r\nnineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury. It served everyone well. We grew and, as a\r\nresult, were able to consolidate a nation in which\r\nequality, justice and freedom prevailed.\r\nThat globalization had one great advantage:\r\nmarkets were open to the fruits of our labour and to the\r\nproducts of our land. Today circumstances are quite\r\ndifferent, which is having adverse effects on the lives\r\nof our people. This political Assembly is a great\r\nAssembly of peoples, whom we, as heads of State and\r\nGovernment, represent. It is in this forum, at the\r\nhighest and most representative level, that we must\r\ntake the decisions and undertake the commitments that\r\nwill determine our future and that of succeeding\r\ngenerations.\r\nUruguay believes that the struggle for that\r\nfreedom is one of the fundamental tasks facing the\r\nUnited Nations in the next millennium.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Alberto Fujimori Fujimori, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru.\r\nPresident Fujimori (spoke in Spanish): At this\r\nMillennium Summit, at which we are collectively\r\nexamining the role that the United Nations is to play in\r\nthe twenty-first century, the Peruvian Government\r\ndeems it necessary to look beyond key general aspects,\r\nwhich can be considered and discussed at a later date,\r\nto the question of securing economic resources, which\r\ncan help to reduce extreme poverty. That is possibly\r\nthe most important goal to emerge from this Summit.\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nTo this end, we have to recognize the enormous\r\nproportions being assumed today by international drug\r\ntrafficking  another issue we have decided to tackle.\r\nWe believe that, without giving short shrift to direct\r\nefforts to eradicate this phenomenon, assets seized\r\nfrom drug traffickers should be used to achieve the\r\naforementioned goal.\r\nTo date little is known of the fate of the\r\nthousands of millions of dollars that are being kept in\r\nsecret accounts. We need mechanisms which, without\r\nviolating the right to privacy of legal bank accounts,\r\nwill nonetheless allow these ill-gotten gains to be\r\nconfiscated for the benefit of poor countries. This\r\nwould represent a major step forward in combating\r\ndrug trafficking as well as a tremendous contribution to\r\nachieving this common goal and alleviating the\r\ndifficulties of poor countries, which suffer the greatest\r\nharm as a result of the actions of criminal\r\norganizations.\r\nIn this way the endlessly postponed crop-\r\nsubstitution strategy could be funded. Crops such as\r\ncoca leaves, opium poppies or marijuana could be\r\nreplaced with alternatives, thus helping the farmers\r\nwho are growing them out of necessity.\r\nI put forward this proposal, which Peru regards as\r\na tremendous and historic challenge for the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century  a century that\r\nmust be a time for action and concrete achievements\r\naimed at ensuring the welfare of peoples and\r\nsafeguarding world peace and security.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Ernesto Zedillo, President of the United Mexican\r\nStates.\r\nPresident Zedillo (spoke in Spanish): Mexico is\r\nattending this Summit confident that here, our United\r\nNations will undertake serious commitments to\r\nconfront the challenges ushered in by the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe greatest challenge facing us is to ensure that\r\nevery woman and every man can fully enjoy the\r\nfundamental freedoms of the human being  freedom\r\nto be educated, freedom to obtain food, freedom to\r\nsafeguard health, freedom to work, freedom to\r\nparticipate in economic trade, freedom to hold beliefs\r\nand to express their opinions, and freedom to\r\nparticipate in public affairs and in decision-making. To\r\nensure that these freedoms are be exercised not only by\r\nthe most privileged among us but by every single\r\nperson in every part of the world, we have at our\r\ndisposal the proposals contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General and in the draft Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which the Government of Mexico\r\nenthusiastically endorses.\r\nMexico welcomes the fact that the Millennium\r\nDeclaration reaffirms basic principles such as respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms, the\r\nsovereign equality of all States and non-interference in\r\ndomestic affairs.\r\nIt is Mexicos conviction that the political\r\nindependence of nations and the self-determination of\r\npeoples must be fully respected, even in this new era of\r\neconomic, financial and information globalization.\r\nMexico agrees with the Secretary-General that\r\nglobalization offers great opportunities but that, for the\r\ntime being, its benefits are being unevenly distributed.\r\nFrom firsthand experience, we Mexicans know\r\nthat globalization is not the problem. Rather, it is the\r\nreverse: globalization can be part of the solution, or, as\r\nthe Secretary-General has said, it must become a\r\npositive force for the entire world population to resolve\r\nthe real problems: poverty, marginalization and\r\ninequality.\r\nThis inequality, both among and within nations,\r\nhas deepened, for while some are participating in\r\nglobalization others are not, or cannot. In some cases,\r\nthey do not participate because of a lack of political or\r\neconomic freedom  because of a lack of democracy.\r\nOthers, even given the presence of democracy, cannot\r\nparticipate because a lack of education, health and\r\nadequate nutrition prevents them from exercising their\r\nfreedoms and from taking advantage of the potential of\r\nglobalization.\r\nHence the great importance of firmly committing\r\nourselves to working hard to achieve the draft\r\nDeclarations targets on education, health, employment\r\nand equality. Mexico supports those targets and\r\nsubscribes to the idea of formulating national and\r\ncollective plans of action to attain them. We support\r\nthe targets because we are confident that we Mexicans\r\nhave the grounding to do our share to attain them. We\r\nsupport them out of a conviction that if we sow\r\nfreedom, we will reap peace and justice, well-being\r\nand harmony.\r\n8\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nEvery country has an unavoidable task of its own,\r\na task it must carry out through its own efforts, but we\r\nall need the encouragement and the cooperation of the\r\nUnited Nations. We cannot make progress towards our\r\ngoals without urgent reform of the United Nations to\r\nmake it more democratic and representative, more\r\nefficient and useful for all, which will give it greater\r\nlegitimacy and authority in the eyes of the peoples of\r\nthe world. Only an Organization that has reformed to\r\nbecome democratic, and has thus been strengthened,\r\ncan contribute to other crucial endeavours, such as the\r\ncreation of a world free of drugs, small arms and\r\nterrorism, a world capable of preventing and\r\nconfronting natural disasters, a world in which our\r\nchildren will have the freedom to forge just and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr.\r\nAbdurrahman Wahid, President of the Republic of\r\nIndonesia.\r\nPresident Wahid: We are gathered in this forum\r\nto celebrate the existence of the United Nations. The\r\nUnited Nations has enabled us to tackle our problems.\r\nEven though not all problems can be solved, the United\r\nNations itself has developed into an institution that is\r\npowerful enough to address the worlds problems. Of\r\ncourse, some people say that the United Nations is\r\nobsolete. I believe that improvements will come in due\r\ntime, and that they will come again and again. The\r\nworld demands that we should work together and\r\ncoordinate our efforts for the benefit of mankind as a\r\nwhole. In that respect, I would like to welcome the new\r\nmillennium as a time when the United Nations can\r\ndevelop into a more powerful body that will represent\r\nall of us in many areas.\r\nThis morning I had breakfast with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and with other heads of State to talk about\r\ninformation technology, and about how the Economic\r\nand Social Council can support the development of\r\ninformation technology for all countries Members of\r\nthe United Nations. That is just one example of the\r\nthings that can be done with United Nations\r\ncoordination.\r\nThe third millennium is important because in this\r\nmillennium we will be able to coordinate and to work\r\ntogether for the benefit of mankind as a whole. Of\r\ncourse, this means that we will have to look at the\r\noverlapping picture and devise a very effective way of\r\ntackling our problems. As members know, regional\r\nassociations, such as the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) for example, must be\r\nconsidered along with entire continents, such as\r\nAsia  I often talk about the identity of Asia  and\r\nwith international forums such as the United Nations.\r\nThe sometimes overlapping workings of all three can\r\naid and support each countrys individual efforts to\r\nattain sustainable development. That is important\r\nbecause, without the existence of the United Nations,\r\ncontinent-wide groupings and regional associations, we\r\nwill never be able to achieve the solidarity needed for\r\nsuch development.\r\nOf course, we have different interpretations of\r\nwhat is taking place, for example the problem between\r\nus and East Timor and developments within the\r\nIndonesian side of Timor. Earlier, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral called for the observance of a minute of\r\nsilence for the death of United Nations personnel in\r\nAtambua; that is an example of the many incidents we\r\nmust address and the many occurrences we must\r\nconsider as an international body.\r\nBeing an optimist, I therefore look forward to the\r\nrest of the new millennium as a time when we will be\r\nable to strive together and to coordinate our efforts to\r\ndevelop together and attain results that will mean an\r\nimproved lot for mankind.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Denis\r\nSassou Nguesso, President of the Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nPresident Nguesso (spoke in French): We\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his relevant\r\nreport (A/54/2000), in which he reflects upon the\r\nproblems and the challenges that the world is facing.\r\nWe are most grateful for that analysis, as well as for the\r\noutcome of the South Summit of the Group of 77,\r\nwhich took place last April at Havana. The issues\r\naddressed there included good governance, peace and\r\nsecurity, globalization, indebtedness and the fight\r\nagainst poverty; these are matters to which the people\r\nof the Congo attach the greatest importance as we\r\nemerge from the catastrophe caused by the repeated\r\ncivil wars we have experienced of late. The Congo has\r\nemerged from these terrible challenges, wounded and\r\ntorn apart.\r\n9\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nIn addition, we have made peace our sole priority.\r\nPeace is the priority because we must rebuild a\r\nshattered country.\r\nIn this regard, my Government has adopted an\r\ninterim three-year post-conflict programme. For it to be\r\nimplemented, international community support is\r\nnecessary. Peace is a priority so as to bring about the\r\nconditions necessary to give new impetus to the\r\ndemocratic process. A major national debate on a draft\r\nconstitution will soon take place as a preliminary to\r\ngeneral elections.\r\nPeace in the Congo will always be fragile unless\r\nCentral Africa quickly regains its footing and stability.\r\nFor this to happen, the conflicts that are still dividing\r\nthe region  and particularly the most worrisome\r\nconflict, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nmust be properly settled. In this regard, the\r\ninternational community has the major responsibility. It\r\nis time to escape the shackles of procrastination and\r\nprevarication and to act in accord with the demands of\r\nhistory so as to save the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and the entire region of Central Africa and the\r\nGreat Lakes. It is time to create, without further delay,\r\nall the conditions necessary and seize every proper\r\nopportunity to come up with a comprehensive peace\r\nand stability settlement that will benefit all the\r\ncountries in the region. It is time and urgent that the\r\nStates in this enormous area come together and\r\ncombine their will and energy to vigorously undertake\r\nthe regional integration process.\r\nAchieving definitive peace will require taking up\r\nthis noble mission. This is why I suggest that we very\r\nquickly consider holding an international conference\r\nthat brings together all the countries in the region of\r\nCentral Africa and the Great Lakes, along with the\r\ninternational community, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity.\r\nIn speaking about the conflict in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, I would like to call attention to\r\nthe fact that a humanitarian catastrophe is occurring in\r\nthe north of my country, in the Likouala region.\r\nBetween 70,000 and 100,000 refugees, fleeing the\r\nconflict in the north of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, have settled  without any sort of assistance\r\nand amid the general indifference of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Headquarters of the United Nations is the\r\nbest possible place to speak about human rights. May I\r\nbe allowed here, from this rostrum of the nations, to\r\nappeal to the international community to take a look at\r\nits past  our common past  to recall what has been\r\ndone on this earth. I am referring to the most enormous\r\nattack on human dignity  the black slave trade and\r\nslavery. Denying men and women their humanity, these\r\npractices were the greatest violation of human rights.\r\nAt this moment when we have just seen the end\r\nof the second millennium during which these tragedies\r\nof universal history were enacted, we appeal to\r\nhumanity, to the international community here\r\nrepresented, to see that the black slave trade and\r\nslavery be acknowledged as crimes against humanity.\r\nWe are not seeking any reparations. Above all, it\r\nis a matter of history, there is an obligation to\r\nremember. It is a matter of the truth and of dignity for\r\nhumanity. Thus the dark page of the millennium that\r\nhas ended can be turned once and for all.\r\nWhen one is at a crossroads, there are signposts\r\nthat one must know how to read, there are symbols that\r\none must know how to interpret, if one is not to be\r\nmisled and make incorrect choices.\r\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads, together\r\nwe must make sure that it is put on the right road to\r\nsave the world from collective regression. This right\r\nroad is that of the reform that has been suggested by,\r\naspired to and demanded by the majority of our\r\nnations. But, unfortunately, this reform continues to be\r\npostponed. The time has come to implement this\r\nreform.\r\nThis reform means arriving at an equitable\r\nrepresentation of all the nations by strengthening the\r\npowers of the General Assembly and increasing\r\nmembership in the Security Council. This reform also\r\nmeans making the Organization more human, to make\r\nman once again the centre of the Organizations\r\nconcerns and interests, so that the United Nations can\r\ntake once more its place at the heart of international\r\nrelations and at the heart of universal issues and\r\nuniversality  for which the United Nations provides,\r\nat the same time, the foundation. This reform also\r\nmeans promoting the Organizations multilateral\r\ncharacter and, above all, acting so that the United\r\nNations can again play its proper role and take up its\r\nproper responsibility in peacekeeping. This reform\r\nmeans finally truly democratizing the United Nations\r\nso that it can be the forum for facilitating the true\r\nrealization of the aspirations of all humanity and so\r\n10\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nthat it can allow the entire community of nations to\r\nparticipate in the real exercise of power within our\r\nOrganization.\r\nAfrica is expecting that, as a result of such\r\ninspired reform, it will take its proper and rightful\r\nplace.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Robert\r\nMugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nPresident Mugabe: We are gathered here to\r\nobserve the new millennium, whose arrival we have\r\nbeen privileged to witness. I want to begin by asking\r\nwhether this passage of time is a marker of qualitative\r\nchange in the human condition and in human relations,\r\nis it human change in qualitative terms? Has the\r\npassage transported us all into a new commonwealth of\r\ndiverse yet truly united peoples of the world living in\r\none village? Are all the peoples of the world truly in\r\nthe twenty-first century by the way they live?\r\nSadly, most of us in Africa and the developing\r\nworld are still stuck in problems dating back to the\r\ndays of slavery and colonialism. We remain burdened\r\nwith the unfinished business of the twentieth century,\r\nincluding even the problem of the colour line.\r\nIn Zimbabwe, and only because of the colour line\r\narising from British colonialism, 70 per cent of the best\r\narable land is owned by less than 1 per cent of the\r\npopulation, which happens to be white, while the black\r\nmajority is congested on barren land. We have sought\r\nto redress this inequity through a land reform and\r\nresettlement programme that will effect economic and\r\nsocial justice, and this in terms of our constitution and\r\nlaws. But what has been the response of former\r\nimperialist quarters?\r\nTheir response has been staggering beyond\r\ndescription. My country, my Government, my party\r\nand my own person have been labelled land\r\ngrabbers, demonized, reviled and threatened with\r\nsanctions in the face of accusations of reverse racism.\r\nW. E. B. Du Bois must be turning in his grave for\r\nhaving thought the problem of the colour line would\r\ndisappear with the twentieth century. But our\r\nconscience, of course, remains clear. We will not go\r\nback. We shall continue to effect economic and social\r\njustice for all our people without fear or favour.\r\nOur world has shrunk into a global village, and\r\ntime, place and distance continue to shrink inexorably\r\nby the day. The biggest challenge for us still remains\r\nnot only cyberspace, nor the great superhighway\r\nresponsible for shrinking our world, but demands of us\r\nan answer to the age-old question, who is my\r\nneighbour? Whichever part of the globe we find\r\nourselves in, the questions that should be asked are\r\nwhether the man, the woman, the country, the region\r\nand the continent on my doorstep are neighbourly and\r\nwhether the culture or civilization of my neighbour\r\ntruly coincides and blends with mine to enable us have\r\npeaceful and friendly coexistence.\r\nThe question my compatriots and I face in\r\nZimbabwe, as put to us by our peasants, is whether a\r\nglobalized environment will enable them to have a\r\npatch of land to till and whether the ugly anomaly\r\nwhich history gave them in respect of land ownership\r\nshall be resolved in order to enlarge their own freedom\r\nso they can begin to be like the rest of mankind. They\r\nask why a predatory political economy that the United\r\nNations rejected and helped fight in the 1960s,\r\nthroughout the 1970s and in the 1980s now has once\r\nagain found so many globalized protectors? They want\r\nto understand why a system which is at the centre of\r\npoverty, at the centre of race relations, at the centre of\r\ndenying developing countries their sense of\r\nsovereignty and democracy is made to appear so right,\r\njust and fair.\r\nWe are either makers of a new world based on\r\nnew democratic principles of economic and social\r\njustice or we remain in the old world with some\r\nconquering nations still set on old agendas of shrinking\r\nthe rights of smaller nations as they enlarge their own\r\nconquests, sanctifying this under the cover of good\r\ngovernance, transparency, anti-corruption, democracy,\r\nhuman rights and digital technology.\r\nWe anticipate the risk of importing the spirit and\r\nthe contradictions of the Victorian era of slavery and\r\ncolonialism into the new millennium and the new\r\nworld order. We also risk accepting the hypocrisy\r\nhidden in the demand for the democratic reform of\r\nnational Governments and institutions in developing\r\ncountries while doing nothing to reform the\r\nundemocratic structures and practices of international\r\nbodies such as the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nindeed our very United Nations itself.\r\nIf the new millennium, like the last, remains an\r\nage of hegemonic empires and conquerors doing the\r\nsame old things in new technological ways, remains the\r\n11\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nage of the master race, of the master economy and\r\nmaster State, then I am afraid we in developing\r\ncountries will have to stand up as a matter of principle\r\nand say no, not again.\r\nThe time has come for the practice of political\r\nand economic dominance of poor nations by the rich to\r\ngive way to the birth of a new interdependent world\r\nthat recognizes and respects the diversity and the\r\ndignity of all cultures and civilizations. In this\r\nconnection, I am pleased that the United Nations has\r\ndeclared 2001 the United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Burhanuddin Rabbani, President of the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Rabbani (spoke in Persian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Allow me at the outset to\r\nexpress our gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his comprehensive, analytical,\r\nforward-looking, visionary and challenging report\r\nentitled We the peoples: the role of the United Nations\r\nin the twenty-first century.\r\nThe numerous specific goals and programmes\r\noutlined in this report could well be considered the\r\nUnited Nations plan of action for the twenty-first\r\ncentury. It is the only multilateral body with universal\r\nmembership and a mandate, derived from its Charter,\r\nencompassing security, development, human rights and\r\nenvironmental protection.\r\nThe founding of the United Nations 55 years ago\r\nmarked the victory of moral principles and the triumph\r\nof democratic values, and Afghanistan joined the\r\nUnited Nations the following year. While the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan remains strongly committed to the\r\nprovisions, purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, this Summit presents a timely\r\nopportunity at the threshold of the new millennium, to\r\nrethink and reassess the United Nations goals,\r\nfunctions, successes and failures around the globe since\r\nits inception.\r\nThe Secretary-Generals report sets out a practical\r\nvision for the Organization in a globalized world, one\r\nthat has changed dramatically over the past 55 years.\r\nAmong the key messages in this report is the need to\r\nmake globalization more inclusive, thus creating more\r\nopportunities for all, and not to leave billions of people\r\nin a state of poverty and exclusion.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan fully agrees\r\nwith the report of the Secretary-General that the\r\ntwentieth century enjoyed unprecedented economic\r\ngains. However, 1.2 billion people still live on less than\r\n$1 a day. The combination of extreme poverty with\r\nextreme inequality within and between countries is an\r\naffront to our common humanity, a tragic situation\r\nrequiring urgent global solidarity. In the past decade,\r\nmore efforts were made for the expansion of global\r\nmarkets than for poverty reduction, human rights and\r\nenvironmental protection. Global solidarity\r\nnecessitates that rich countries further open their\r\nmarkets to poor countries products, as well as provide\r\ndeeper and faster debt relief and better development\r\nassistance.\r\nIn order to cope effectively with these economic\r\nand social challenges, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil should be further strengthened, thus enabling it\r\nto fulfil the duties attributed to it in the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan fully endorses\r\nthe values and goals presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for this Summits consideration.\r\nHaving endured two decades of ceaseless\r\nsuffering, we earnestly wish that the Afghan nation will\r\nenjoy peace and security at the beginning of the\r\ntwenty-first century. We desire the creation of a broad-\r\nbased government in Afghanistan, under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations, so that our nation can start the\r\ntask of reconstruction and development in an\r\nenvironment free from conspiracy and foreign\r\ninterference, which have turned our land into a terrorist\r\ntraining camp, a centre for drug smugglers and a base\r\nfor spreading instability.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Omer\r\nHassan Ahmed Al-Bashir, President of the Republic of\r\nthe Sudan.\r\nPresident Al-Bashir (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme at the outset to express my appreciation for the\r\nefforts and endeavours of the Co-Chairpersons in\r\npreparation for this historic event. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Sudan, and on my\r\nown behalf, allow me also to express our appreciation\r\nto Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, who took\r\n12\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nthe initiative two years ago of convening this\r\nMillennium Summit to explore a new role for the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century. I would like\r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport in which he outlined this role.\r\nIt is the Sudans strong belief that the United\r\nNations continues to represent the ideal mechanism for\r\nthe enhancement of international cooperation and\r\nglobal partnership. The United Nations remains\r\nindispensable and irreplaceable. To achieve its goals,\r\nwe should reaffirm the principles that constitute the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations, as enshrined in the\r\nCharter, foremost among which is respect for\r\nsovereignty of States, non-interference in their internal\r\naffairs and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nWe view with satisfaction the Assemblys final\r\ndocument, which includes important elements such as\r\nsolidarity, tolerance, freedom and pluralism. We should\r\nall endeavour to make this Organization more\r\ndemocratic and representative by reviving the central\r\nrole of the General Assembly and enhancing its\r\nefficiency so that the United Nations can carry out its\r\ntasks.\r\nThere is also a great need to reform the Security\r\nCouncil, to make it more democratic and\r\nrepresentative, and to improve its methods of work,\r\nincluding the issues of decision-making and the right to\r\nveto.\r\nWe appreciate the agreement among all Member\r\nStates to give special attention to Africa, as set forth in\r\nthe Declaration, which calls for effective measures to\r\nenable the African countries to overcome their\r\neconomic difficulties, to achieve stability, to move\r\ntowards development and to meet the challenges of\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe four decades devoted to development have\r\nelapsed without having attained the desired goals for\r\nthe developing countries, and for Africa in particular.\r\nThis failure has been particularly reflected in the\r\nwidening development gap between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, the increased levels of poverty in\r\nsub-Saharan African countries, the decline of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, the deterioration of terms of\r\ntrade and the increase in the levels of external debt.\r\nThe convening of the Millennium Summit revives\r\nour hopes of overcoming the challenges facing\r\ninternational cooperation and development. In order to\r\nrealize this, we call upon the international community,\r\nfirst, to cancel the external debts of the highly indebted\r\npoor countries, as proposed by the Secretary-General in\r\nparagraph 181 of his report (A/54/2000); secondly, to\r\nfacilitate market access of developing countries\r\nexports to industrialized countries; and, thirdly, to\r\nimplement the commitment of 0.7 per cent of official\r\ndevelopment assistance by industrialized countries for\r\ndevelopment of the developing countries.\r\nThe Sudan understands the concerns of the\r\ninternational community regarding the armed conflict\r\nin southern Sudan. Here we reiterate the commitment\r\nof the Government of the Sudan to work for a political\r\nresolution of this conflict on the following basis: first,\r\nan immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in order to\r\nfacilitate delivery of humanitarian assistance to the\r\nneedy and as a necessary prerequisite for confidence-\r\nbuilding and for the success of peace efforts; secondly,\r\nan immediate start to negotiations based on current\r\npeace initiatives; and thirdly, a just settlement that\r\npaves the way for a fair distribution of power and\r\nwealth, establishes rights and duties based on\r\ncitizenship and guarantees total adherence to\r\ninternational human rights standards.\r\nWe take this opportunity to appeal to the\r\ninternational community to support our efforts to\r\nresolve this conflict and achieve peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment. We urge this gathering to use the\r\nMillennium Summit as an opportunity to reinforce the\r\nvalues of peaceful coexistence and to respect cultural,\r\nethical and religious pluralism.\r\nWe assure the Assembly that we in Sudan will\r\nspare no effort to achieve these noble goals and to\r\ncooperate with all Member States on the basis of the\r\nprinciples of respect for the choices of others and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States. In\r\nfact, that is what our tolerant faith and traditions\r\ndictate. In the Koran Allah states:\r\nO mankind! We created\r\nyou from a single (pair)\r\nof a male and a female,\r\nand made you into\r\nnations and tribes, that\r\nye may know each other.\r\nVerily the most honoured of you\r\nin the sight of Allah\r\nis (he who is) the most\r\nrighteous of you.\r\n13\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\n(The Holy Koran, 49:13).\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President and Commander-in-\r\nChief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of\r\nNigeria.\r\nPresident Obasanjo: Humanity has come a long\r\nway out of the ruins of the Second World War thanks to\r\nthis Organization, the United Nations. We have\r\nemerged from the era of cold war and incessant fears of\r\nglobal conflagrations. A new horizon is now in front of\r\nus, predicated on ever-widening possibilities for\r\ndevelopment in all spheres of human endeavours,\r\nresulting from unparalleled advances in science and\r\ntechnology.\r\nBut new challenges have also emerged:\r\nchallenges of poverty and new diseases that have so far\r\ndefied scientific knowledge and cure. The world is also\r\nfaced with the scourge of internal conflicts which\r\nthreaten regional peace and impede social and\r\neconomic development.\r\nAlthough the world has generally become a safer\r\nplace to live in, thanks to the contributions of the\r\nUnited Nations, we must all feel deeply worried that\r\nthe message of hope which the Organization has been\r\nspreading is yet to reach the millions of humankind for\r\nwhom it is intended. For the vast majority of our\r\npeoples, grinding poverty has remained a fact of their\r\neveryday existence.\r\nThe national Governments to whom these\r\nmillions look for succour find themselves in the\r\nunenviable predicament of helplessness, incapable of\r\nbringing meaningful changes in their peoples well-\r\nbeing, due to the heavy burden of external debts which\r\nhave crippled their capacities for national initiatives.\r\nOld diseases, such as tuberculosis, which we all\r\nthought had been eradicated, have reappeared, with\r\ndevastating consequences, especially in developing\r\ncountries. In addition, we now have HIV/AIDS, which\r\ncontinues to defy cure, and has now combined with\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases to\r\nform a lethal nexus with as much potential for\r\ndevastation as war itself, and is thus a modern-day\r\nthreat to world peace and security.\r\nThe new millennium is being shaped by forces of\r\nglobalization that are turning our world into a village.\r\nThus the new millennium will demand of us, more than\r\never before, to live and work together as members of\r\none human family. But up to now globalization has\r\nmeant prosperity only for the chosen few of the\r\nindustrialized countries. For most of us in the\r\ndeveloping world, globalization will continue to ring\r\nhollow and be of dubious value, until we see its\r\npositive effects on our fortunes. In short, globalization\r\nhas to be seen to mean the eradication of poverty.\r\nThen, and only then, will the true spirit of good-\r\nneighbourliness reign in the new global village.\r\nThe world community is challenged to evolve a\r\nnew system of international cooperation that will help\r\nto eliminate abject poverty throughout the world and\r\nintegrate the developing countries into the globalized\r\nworld economy. At the first South Summit of the G-77,\r\nheld in Havana, Cuba, last April, it was resolved that a\r\nnew and meaningful partnership with the industrialized\r\nnations needed to be forged in order to make this earth\r\na better place for all of us.\r\nWe must all be concerned about the persistence of\r\ninternal conflicts, more especially in our region of\r\nAfrica. These conflicts have proved to be very brutal,\r\nsavage and devastating. The unfortunate destruction of\r\nlives and properties and its effects on the weaker\r\nmembers of society, namely, children and women,\r\nremind us, as Members of the United Nations, that our\r\nobjective of world peace is still beyond the reach of\r\nmany communities. Our aim in the new millennium,\r\ntherefore, must include a renewed determination to\r\nresolve these conflicts and prevent new ones so that\r\ntogether all humanity will reap the benefit of peace and\r\nmarch forward in harmony and prosperity.\r\nExternal debt has emerged as the greatest obstacle\r\nto progress in developing countries. Indeed, we note\r\nwith appreciation that a number of initiatives have been\r\nput in place. The reality, however, is that these\r\nmeasures are inadequate. The G-77 strongly urges\r\ncreditor nations to seize this historic moment to\r\nunshackle the economies of developing countries by\r\ncancelling all their external debts. This is the only way\r\nin which these countries can be given the chance to\r\neffectively plan for the improvement of living\r\nstandards for their peoples.\r\nWe are at a new dawn; what it portends we cannot\r\nsay. But this much we owe to ourselves and to\r\nsucceeding generations: a world where all nations, all\r\nraces and all peoples can live in dignity and in peace\r\nwith one another. We must all resolve to strengthen and\r\n14\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nreinvigorate the United Nations for the work and the\r\nworld ahead.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations, in particular\r\nthe expansion and democratization of the Security\r\nCouncil, is therefore a task which can no longer be\r\npostponed if our Organization is to face up to the\r\nchallenges of the new millennium. In this respect, the\r\nGroup of 77 pledges its willingness to enter into\r\nmeaningful dialogue with all our partners so as to re-\r\nenergize the United Nations  indeed, a body for\r\nwhich there is no substitute  to meet the challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century and the third millennium.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Sultan Haji\r\nHassanal Bolkiah, Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan of\r\nBrunei Darussalam.\r\nSultan Hassanal Bolkiah: Sixteen years ago, I\r\nhad the honour of addressing this Assembly for the\r\nfirst time when my country was admitted to the United\r\nNations. It was a different period of world history. The\r\ncold war then divided the world along ideological\r\nlines, and the threat of a nuclear holocaust was real.\r\nThe smaller developing countries were particularly\r\nvulnerable. They were used as pawns in the global\r\nchess game. Brunei Darussalam was one such country.\r\nWe were determined not to be drawn in.\r\nIn the United Nations we found shelter and\r\nassurance. It provided a forum where all Member\r\nStates sovereignty would be respected, and where all\r\nnations, large and small, would have an equal voice\r\nand one vote. The United Nations Charter gave small\r\nnations like my own a sense of hope and security. For\r\nthe last 16 years, Brunei Darussalam has participated in\r\nthe United Nations as a full member of the\r\ninternational community of nations. We have strongly\r\nsupported the United Nations role in international\r\naffairs. We have done what we could to promote the\r\nprinciples and processes of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe are committed to continuing this within the limits\r\nof our resources.\r\nThe post-cold-war era has brought new\r\nchallenges. Globalization, the result of the revolution\r\nin information technology, will break down traditional\r\nbarriers and borders. Dynamic and powerful forces are\r\nat work and will increase economic cooperation and\r\naccelerate growth and development. This can lead to\r\nimproving quality of life, higher standards of living\r\nand greater opportunities for all. The benefits are great.\r\nBut there are downsides to globalization. With\r\nincreased movement across borders, transnational\r\ncrime and terrorism have become serious problems.\r\nThe disparity between North and South continues to\r\ngrow as the poorer nations struggle to keep pace with\r\nthe first world. Globalization could lead to the\r\nmarginalization of the developing and less developed\r\ncountries if they do not adapt themselves in order to\r\nmaximize its benefits. There can be no going back to\r\nthe past. As we begin the twenty-first century, we\r\nshould examine and address the negative effects of\r\nglobalization. These are challenges that go beyond the\r\nability of individual Governments to tackle.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, the United Nations\r\nrole as the conscience of the world is crucial to balance\r\nthe interests of the successful and the less successful\r\nnations in the new economies of globalization. It is a\r\nconscience that needs to moderate the results of the\r\nwinner-take-all paradigm of free-market competition.\r\nBrunei Darussalam faces many of the same\r\nchallenges as the developing nations of Asia, Africa\r\nand Latin America. To meet them, a country needs to\r\nadapt and respond quickly to an uncertain and\r\nconstantly changing external environment. To do this,\r\nits most important resource  its people  needs to be\r\nequipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to\r\ngive it a fighting chance.\r\nI would therefore like to stress the critical\r\nimportance of programmes, in particular those that\r\nfocus on health and education. They play a crucial role\r\nin helping the development of many of the poorer and\r\nless developed countries. By investing in the future of\r\nthe people of these countries, we will lay the solid\r\nfoundation upon which these countries futures can be\r\nconstructed.\r\nWe should do so not merely out of a sense of\r\nmoral obligation. The survival and progress of the less\r\ndeveloped members of the international community is\r\nin our best interest. As globalization makes our world\r\never more interdependent, it is becoming increasingly\r\ndifficult to separate ourselves from events that occur\r\nbeyond our immediate regions. There are few matters\r\nthat are local problems any more. This point was\r\nbrought home in 1997 by the far-reaching effects of the\r\nfinancial crisis that swept through South-East Asia.\r\nWe cannot have a world in which the knowledge-\r\nbased economies are racing along the information\r\nhighway while the less developed countries are lagging\r\n15\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nbehind and struggling with disease, famine and\r\npoverty. The best way to ensure a stable international\r\norder is to provide developing and less developed\r\ncountries with knowledge and opportunities for\r\neconomic, social and technological advancement. This\r\nwill require renewed commitment from all Members of\r\nthe United Nations. It would entail a far greater\r\nresponsibility than we have taken on thus far. This can\r\nbe achieved if we all come together in a concerted\r\neffort. I therefore appeal to all members of the\r\ninternational community to accept this responsibility.\r\nAs we begin a new century and a new\r\nmillennium, let us make every effort to achieve global\r\npeace, freedom, tolerance and prosperity in our time.\r\nWe must allow the United Nations to concentrate its\r\nenergies on making the world as we would all like to\r\nsee it. This, I believe, would be the greatest tribute we\r\ncould offer the Secretary-General and all those who\r\nhave served the United Nations in the last half century.\r\nThank you for allowing me this opportunity to\r\naddress the Assembly and to share some of my\r\nthoughts on the direction and future of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Namibia): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Islam\r\nKarimov, President of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nPresident Karimov (spoke in Russian): Allow\r\nme to express my appreciation for the opportunity to\r\nspeak at the Millennium Summit. On the threshold of a\r\nnew century, international security and stability are still\r\namong the fundamental problems facing the\r\ncontemporary world. The only difference is that instead\r\nof remnants of the cold war and the associated\r\nobstacles, international terrorism, extremism,\r\naggressive nationalism and separatism are the\r\ndangerous detonators that can undermine peace and\r\nstability. Uzbekistan fully supports the basic United\r\nNations principle of the indivisibility of security.\r\nToday it is obvious that there can be no\r\ncomprehensive international security without regional\r\nsecurity and the national security of individual States.\r\nThose  whether in Europe, the Americas or any other\r\nregion  that are trying to create an exclusive security\r\ncordon to isolate themselves from ostensibly alien\r\nproblems are blind to reality: todays world is tightly\r\ninterrelated and indivisible. Experience has shown that\r\nongoing wars, conflicts and confrontations in some\r\nregions or States inevitably extend beyond those\r\nbounds and take on a cross-border, transnational\r\ncharacter, dragging additional territories and Powers\r\ninto the heat of the conflict.\r\nThis may be seen in the Central Asian region,\r\nwhich is at present becoming a target for the\r\nexpansionism and aggression of the forces of\r\ninternational terrorism and extremism, which harbour\r\nthe ambitious goal of diverting the States of the region\r\nfrom their chosen road of democratic, secular\r\ndevelopment, and of setting up despotic clerical\r\nregimes in their place.\r\nIt is self-evident that the war in Afghanistan,\r\nwhich has continued for more than 20 years, is a\r\nprincipal source of that threat. Afghanistan has become\r\na training ground and hotbed of international terrorism\r\nand extremism, and the main source and the warehouse\r\nof world drug production, which earns billions of\r\ndollars and fuels international terrorism. Areas\r\nbordering Afghanistan, first and foremost the States of\r\nCentral Asia, are being turned into one of the easiest\r\nand shortest conduits for transporting hundreds of tons\r\nof heroin, mainly to the countries of Europe and North\r\nAmerica. That example clearly shows the way in which\r\ntwo monstrous phenomena of our time  international\r\nterrorism and drug trafficking  are coalescing.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to say to the\r\nUnited Nations, the Security Council and the\r\ninternational community that the continuing war in\r\nAfghanistan poses as a threat to the security not only of\r\nthe States of Central Asia, but of the whole world. We\r\nmust do our utmost speedily to achieve a peaceful\r\nsettlement of the Afghan problem and to help the long-\r\nsuffering Afghan people to gain the peace for which\r\nthey have waited so long. We support all initiatives to\r\nstabilize the situation in Afghanistan. I stress that the\r\nTashkent Declaration on Fundamental Principles for a\r\nPeaceful Settlement of the Conflict in Afghanistan,\r\nadopted in July 1999 by the members of the Six plus\r\nTwo group set up under United Nations auspices,\r\nremains timely and able to serve as the basis for\r\nnegotiations among the main rival parties.\r\nAlong with the political measures taken in the\r\nframework of the United Nations, it is high time to\r\ndraft an extensive programme for the peaceful post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation of Afghanistan, and for its\r\neconomic and humanitarian renewal.\r\nI turn now to the urgent and central need to\r\nstrengthen the international communitys fight against\r\n16\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nthe growing threat of international terrorism.\r\nUzbekistan welcomes the proposal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for an international\r\nconference on counter-terrorism to be convened under\r\nUnited Nations auspices. I am confident that through\r\njoint efforts we will be able to combat terrorism and\r\nextremism, but only if we fight not only against its\r\nmanifestations but also, and primarily, against\r\ninternational centres with sizeable financial and other\r\ncapacities, which mobilize and direct terrorists, and\r\nprovide them with the most up-to-date weapons and\r\nequipment. It is hard to imagine what the world\r\nsituation would be were those forces to obtain access to\r\ndeadly chemical, biological and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. In that respect it is now important to\r\nsecure, not in words but in practice, the agreement of\r\nthe Group of Eight to eliminate the financial sources of\r\nterrorist activity.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I call on members to support\r\nUzbekistans initiative, put forward at the Istanbul\r\nsummit of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, on the establishment of an\r\ninternational counter-terrorism centre within the United\r\nNations system.\r\nUzbekistan advocates strict and unconditional\r\napplication by all States of the international nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament regime. Without\r\nthis, one can hardly speak about maintaining strategic\r\nstability either on the global or the regional level.\r\nAll of this adds to the importance of Uzbekistans\r\ninitiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\r\nCentral Asia and of its rapid endorsement by the\r\ninternational community. We highly appreciate the\r\nSecretary-Generals support of the activities of the\r\nregional expert group working to complete a regional\r\ndraft treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nIn considering the entire complex of regional\r\nproblems, one cannot ignore the issues of ecological\r\nsecurity and the environment. Both in the United\r\nNations and in other international forums, I have\r\nrepeatedly spoken of the problems of the Aral Sea\r\nbasin. Because of its scope, the Aral crisis has spilled\r\nover the boundaries of the Central Asian region; it has\r\nbecome a problem of global importance; its pernicious\r\ninfluence is seen in climate change and biological\r\nbalance; it has negative effects on health and on the\r\ngene pool of future generations.\r\nI believe that no one needs to be persuaded of\r\nhow dangerous and unpredictable the implications of\r\nthe dying Aral Sea are for Europe and other areas of\r\nthe planet, or of the consequences of indifference to\r\nthis problem. To promote international cooperation in\r\nthe field of ecological security and to enlist the\r\nfinances of international institutions and donor\r\ncountries, I propose the establishment of a council on\r\nthe problems of the Aral Sea and the Aral basin, under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme.\r\nThe current challenges and risks require the\r\ndynamic adaptation of the entire United Nations system\r\nand its mechanisms to the complicated realities and\r\nperspectives and to the elaboration of new approaches\r\nto such issues as the maintenance of peace, security\r\nand stability. We understand United Nations reform,\r\nfirst, as accomplishing a set of measures to enhance its\r\nrole and significance in tackling regional and global\r\nproblems.\r\nIn this context, we think it necessary, first, to\r\nconduct a phased, gradual reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. The number of its permanent members should\r\nbe increased to the benefit of developed and\r\ndeveloping countries alike. It is expedient to increase\r\nthe number of permanent and non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council. As the first step in this\r\ndirection, we propose that Germany and Japan be\r\nincluded in the permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, as those countries play a significant role in\r\ninternational affairs and, moreover, are currently the\r\nmain sponsors of United Nations activities and of\r\nnumerous humanitarian and charity projects and\r\nprogrammes.\r\nSecondly, in order to make the United Nations\r\nreaction to global and regional challenges more\r\noperative and effective, we suggest the expansion of\r\nthe authority of the Secretary-General.\r\nThirdly, in order to strengthen the role and\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council in the prevention\r\nof military conflicts, instruments and mechanisms for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of confrontations and disputes\r\nmust be utilized effectively, in particular through the\r\napplication of so-called peace-building mechanisms in\r\nthe course of settling long-term conflicts.\r\nIn conclusion allow me to congratulate the\r\nSummit Co-Chairpersons, Mr. Sam Nujoma, President\r\nof the Republic of Namibia, and Ms. Tarja Halonen,\r\n17\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nPresident of the Republic of Finland, on their election\r\nto their demanding posts. I am convinced that our\r\nSummit will be successful.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Mr. Bakili Muluzi,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi.\r\nPresident Muluzi: Let me begin by stating that\r\nmy country is happy to endorse the Secretary-Generals\r\nreport, which is full of wisdom and insight and sets out\r\nthe agenda for the United Nations in the years to come.\r\nWe are especially pleased that the report highlights the\r\nmany challenges which Africa continues to face and\r\nthe need for a clear plan of action.\r\nIt is a matter of great concern that poverty\r\ncontinues to be a major challenge to humanity. It is a\r\nshameful scandal for mankind that so many must live\r\nin poverty while others live in extreme wealth. In my\r\ncountry, poverty reduction is the central goal of our\r\npolicies, but our efforts continue to be hampered by\r\nfactors beyond our control, including trade imbalances\r\nand unpredictable weather patterns resulting in\r\nrecurrent drought. Today, Malawis very basis of\r\neconomic survival, tobacco, is likely to be phased out\r\ndue to the international anti-smoking initiative. This is\r\ncompelling my country to face the challenge of\r\neconomic diversification. We have the will to take on\r\nthis challenge, but we will need the sympathy and\r\npartnership of the wider family of nations.\r\nLike other sub-Saharan African countries, Malawi\r\ncontinues to be weighed down by a crippling debt\r\nburden, which we believe is one of the great injustices\r\nof our time. Debt-servicing has diverted my countrys\r\nmeagre resources from effectively improving the\r\nquality of life of our people. While Malawi appreciates\r\nthe benefits of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\nDebt Initiative, we remain convinced that total debt\r\ncancellation would help us much better. The money\r\nused to service these debts, which were inherited from\r\nan earlier generation of leaders, would best be used in\r\nour poverty reduction programmes, such as those\r\nrelating to education, health, sanitation and\r\ninfrastructures. There is much talk at this forum about\r\npoverty reduction, but there cannot be any poverty\r\nreduction if the children of Africa remain heavily\r\nindebted even before they are born.\r\nAnother very serious challenge threatening sub-\r\nSaharan Africas progress is the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nDuring the past decade, HIV/AIDS has inflicted havoc\r\non our modest development plans. Unfortunately, the\r\ncosts of drugs that help decelerate the impact of\r\nHIV/AIDS on patients are very prohibitive. I believe\r\nthat the international community has a moral obligation\r\nand responsibility to ensure that cheaper drugs are\r\navailable to our poor countries through grants and not\r\nloans. I am appealing for grants because our countries\r\nalready have the burden of external debts hanging like\r\na noose around their necks.\r\nIt is also a matter of great concern that conflicts\r\ncontinue to worsen the already existing conditions of\r\npoverty in a number of countries in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. In such countries, most resources are being\r\nspent on weapons of war and destruction rather than on\r\nfood for the people. In this regard, Malawi deeply\r\nappreciates the tireless efforts the United Nations is\r\nmaking towards the promotion of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nWe have also observed with concern the factors\r\nwhich seem to impede the Organizations peacekeeping\r\noperations. In some parts of Africa, for example,\r\nevents have clearly shown the need for a strong\r\nmandate for peacekeeping missions. It is also evident\r\nthat the Organization needs a mechanism by which it\r\ncan take quick decisions on the deployment of\r\npeacekeeping missions during emergencies. Malawi\r\ntherefore welcomes the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General on peacekeeping operations.\r\nWith regard to international trade, difficulties in\r\naccessing the markets of the developed countries\r\npersist. I believe that the developed countries have a\r\nduty to assist us in ensuring that we have the capacity\r\nfor effective access to global markets and meaningful\r\nparticipation in the globalization process. As long as\r\nthis much-touted globalization benefits only a few, the\r\nworld cannot claim to be democratic and those who\r\nbenefit from such imbalances cannot have a clear\r\nconscience.\r\nThe people of Malawi will continue to have\r\nstrong confidence in the United Nations despite the\r\nmany difficulties it is facing. The United Nations has\r\nsuffered some reverses, but it can also look back at\r\nmany triumphs, of which we should all be proud. Long\r\nlive the United Nations. Long live the unity, peace and\r\nprogress of mankind.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): Before calling\r\non the next speaker, I must appeal to representatives to\r\nbe good enough to keep silent in the General Assembly\r\n18\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nHall in order to maintain the dignity of the Assembly\r\nand out of courtesy to the speakers.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address on behalf\r\nof the Captains Regent of the Republic of San Marino\r\nby Captain Regent Her Excellency Mrs. Maria\r\nDomenica Michelotti.\r\nMrs. Michelotti (San Marino) (spoke in Italian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): The Captains\r\nRegent of the Republic of San Marino wish to express\r\ntheir sincere satisfaction at the convening of the\r\nMillennium Summit. Such an event brings together the\r\nmost distinguished representatives of the international\r\ncommunity, who are calling today more than ever for\r\nthe affirmation of those principles that are the basis of\r\npeaceful coexistence among peoples and are essential\r\nfor the effective implementation of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\r\nInternationalization and globalization are by now\r\nirreversible, and respect for the cultural and historical\r\nidentity of each people and individual along with the\r\nrespect for the universality of human rights is\r\nfundamental. That being the case, we favour a\r\nmultilateral approach, where economic and social\r\ndevelopment is a shared responsibility and threats to\r\ninternational peace and security are seen as a common\r\nconcern. The United Nations must play a pivotal role\r\nand be the most effective instrument for cohesion and\r\ncooperation. To that end, a culture of solidarity and\r\ncollaboration that guarantees real development for the\r\nfuture  especially for poor countries  is of\r\nparamount importance.\r\nAt the beginning of this new millennium, fighting\r\npoverty and indigence, which afflict a huge number of\r\nmen and women, is a moral imperative that calls for\r\nstronger commitment on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. Well aware of the need to rethink the\r\ncurrent patterns of development and to reconsider the\r\nexisting form of international cooperation, the Captains\r\nRegent welcome and fully support the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the role of the United Nations\r\nand the challenges facing the international community\r\nin the twenty-first century.\r\nThe technological revolution, which brought\r\nabout radical changes in the life of the twentieth\r\ncentury, cannot provide development opportunities\r\nonly for industrialized countries. On the contrary, as an\r\ninstrument of economic and cultural progress, it should\r\nalso benefit less advantaged countries. Access to digital\r\ntechnologies can therefore play an unexpected and\r\nfundamental role in the education of people in areas\r\nwhere traditional infrastructures and services cannot\r\neasily be introduced. This new scientific breakthrough\r\nwill in fact favour closer and intensified relations and\r\nensure developments in a variety of areas, thus\r\nbridging the gap between North and South.\r\nProud of its 1,700 year history, the Republic of\r\nSan Marino, as a clear example of solidarity, welcomes\r\nand is ready to support the United Nations intention to\r\npromote and finance projects designed to foster the\r\nknowledge of and ensure the use of information\r\ntechnologies in developing countries. San Marino\r\nwould like to contribute to the training of groups of\r\nyoung volunteers who can guarantee wide access to\r\ninformation technologies for those who at present\r\ncannot take advantage of that huge development\r\npotential because of their economic and cultural\r\ncircumstances.\r\nUnderstandably, the whole of the international\r\ncommunity  ourselves included  is now looking at\r\nthe beginning of the century and of the millennium\r\nwith a feeling of both hope and concern. It is to be\r\nhoped that the globalization process will help free\r\ndeveloping countries from the hunger, poverty and\r\nexcessive foreign debt that are crippling their\r\neconomies and their development. We are confident\r\nthat peace will be fostered and protected, thanks to\r\nmore effective action on the part of international\r\norganizations. However, we are deeply concerned\r\nabout the ongoing cases of local conflict, bloodshed\r\nand ethnic and religious intolerance that have\r\ndramatically re-emerged over the last few years.\r\nAgainst that background, the Republic of San\r\nMarino has never questioned the central importance of\r\nthe human being or the need to protect all fundamental\r\nrights, including civil and political rights. San Marino\r\nis committed to the International Criminal Court. It has\r\nstrongly supported the abolition of the death penalty\r\nworldwide and has continuously participated in\r\ninternational solidarity projects to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of men, women and children.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino, which we represent,\r\nbelieves that the United Nations is essential for the\r\nprotection of the lofty ideals of peace, justice and\r\nrespect for the rights of every individual. We believe\r\nthis because of our conviction that it is only through\r\nthe continued exercise of its moral authority that the\r\n19\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nUnited Nations can effectively continue to deal in a\r\nconcerted way with the global issues that are the\r\nburdensome legacy of the recent past and a daunting\r\nchallenge for the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Joseph\r\nE. Estrada, President of the Republic of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\nPresident Estrada: This meeting of Heads of\r\nState and Government of the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations is a watershed in history, and I am\r\ndistinctly honoured to address it. I am also pleased to\r\ncongratulate our Co-Chairpersons  His Excellency\r\nMr. Sam Nujoma, President of the Republic of\r\nNamibia, and Her Excellency Ms. Tarja Halonen,\r\nPresident of Finland. Under their leadership, the\r\nMillennium Summit can be a defining moment in the\r\ndestiny of our peoples.\r\nWe enter the new millennium with the regime of\r\nsuper-Power confrontation behind us. But true peace\r\nremains elusive. While the threat of world war has\r\nreceded, wars and violence between States and within\r\nStates continue to erupt. The new diversity of the\r\ntheatres of battle has made the search for global peace\r\nmuch more complex than before. Terrorism recognizes\r\nno borders, and ethnic and religious conflicts are a\r\ncause of dehumanizing violence. On the other hand, the\r\nvery uncertainties of our present world provide us with\r\na unique opportunity to make a mark. We, the largest\r\nassembly ever of the worlds leaders, can make our\r\ncollective legacy to humanity if we lay the foundations\r\nof an international partnership that will truly advance\r\npeace in this century.\r\nFirst, we should adopt preventive diplomacy as\r\nthe principal global tool for peace. Preventive\r\ndiplomacy must replace the use of military force. But\r\nwhere the use of force is unavoidable and justified, it\r\nshould be guided by clearly defined international legal\r\nnorms and practices. Preventive diplomacy is more\r\ncost-effective than peace operations, which are reactive\r\nin nature. We should transform the United Nations\r\nculture of reaction into a culture of pro-action.\r\nSecondly, we should complete our work on\r\ndisarmament. Progress notwithstanding, the world\r\nremains exposed to nuclear disasters, given the\r\nstaggering inventories of nuclear weapons around the\r\nworld.\r\nIt is startling to note that while 1.2 billion people\r\nstruggle to eke out an existence on less than a dollar a\r\nday, the world spent $145 per person for military forces\r\nin 1997. What is even more distressing is that as\r\nmilitaries amass more deadly weapons, agents of terror\r\ncan procure theirs with impunity. It is time to deal in a\r\ncomprehensive manner with the issues of disarmament,\r\nsmall arms proliferation and transnational crime.\r\nThirdly, we need to pursue the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations with greater vigour. Its most important\r\nelement is the restructuring of the Security Council,\r\nwhich should become truly representative of all\r\ncountries. This means expansion of its membership and\r\ngreater transparency in its work.\r\nWe should also provide the Organization with all\r\nthe resources it needs to do its work. The stability of\r\nUnited Nations operations is incompatible with the\r\nuncertainties of its finances. We must all agree to meet\r\nfaithfully our financial obligations to the United\r\nNations and provide it with the financial security it\r\ndeserves.\r\nFourthly, we should work for the universal\r\nacceptance of human rights. In the words of the\r\nSecretary-General, human rights are foreign to no\r\nculture and native to all nations. Stability should not be\r\nwon by trampling on human rights. Each time an\r\nindividuals rights are upheld, all of humanity gains.\r\nEach time they are violated, all of humanity suffers.\r\nLast but not least, there can be no security amid\r\nstarvation and poverty. There can be no peace without\r\ndevelopment, just as there can be no development\r\nwithout peace. Development is a global concern in a\r\nworld that has become indivisible. Yet, while\r\nunprecedented wealth is being created in a few\r\ncountries, destitution blights most other parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe United Nations should be at the centre of\r\nefforts to establish a global economy that uplifts all\r\npeoples and nations. Our goal is not just a borderless\r\nworld for the unfettered movement of capital, goods\r\nand services. It is to build a global economic regime\r\nthat builds productive capacity, but not income gaps;\r\nthat promotes openness instead of corruption; and that\r\nrewards enterprise, but not greed.\r\nI take this opportunity to request the leaders of\r\noil-exporting nations to consider rationalizing the price\r\n20\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nof crude oil with a view to helping the economies of\r\ndeveloping nations.\r\nAs we, the leaders of 189 nations, meet at this\r\nsummit, the worlds peoples will want to know what\r\nfuture we are shaping for them, and whether we plan to\r\nget there together or separately, as adversaries or as\r\npartners.\r\nThe five components of common resolve \r\npreventive diplomacy, true disarmament, United\r\nNations reform, promotion of human rights, and\r\nequitable global development  are the building\r\nblocks of our partnership agenda. We can lay the\r\nfoundations today through our strong endorsement of\r\nthe many initiatives the Secretary-General has placed\r\nbefore us. If we do that, 6 billion souls will know that\r\nwe want the world to have peace, but only with\r\nfreedom; that we want our peoples to savour prosperity,\r\nbut only with fairness; and that we want our nations to\r\nenjoy stability, but only with openness.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Azali\r\nAssoumani, President of the Islamic Federal Republic\r\nof the Comoros.\r\nPresident Assoumani: Peace. The world needs\r\npeace, real peace  a peace that creates conditions for\r\nworldwide stability, secures prosperity for our peoples,\r\nputs an end to conflicts and to the upheavals that\r\nvictimize the worlds peoples, and, finally, a peace that\r\nallows for solidarity and harmony between the most\r\nprivileged and the most vulnerable.\r\nThe Millennium Summit must first of all be a\r\nforum where we come together to exchange views and\r\ndiscuss social and economic inequalities and all of the\r\nother scourges besetting the world. This Summit has\r\nthe historic responsibility of charting the course for the\r\nnascent millennium.\r\nThis millennium must be an era of solidarity, of\r\ndevelopment, of increased well-being. But what\r\nsolidarity are we to build, and what relations are we to\r\nconstruct between North and South? What are the\r\nconditions that need to be met to bring about a culture\r\nof peace where democratic values are respected,\r\nkeeping in mind that the modalities of implementation\r\ncannot be entirely identical between one country and\r\nanother continent?\r\nNo solidarity, no development, no democracy, no\r\ngood governance can be possible in a world where\r\npoverty, ignorance, disease and debt pose a crushing\r\nburden to some countries.\r\nI believe that these are the fundamental\r\nchallenges we are facing today, and it is for that reason\r\nthat all of our citizens are looking to us here in this\r\nforum. Our decisions consequently must meet the\r\nexpectations placed in us.\r\nThe United Nations must be enabled to play its\r\nfull role as a catalyst in order to lay down solid\r\nfoundations for a new equilibrium  a new world\r\norder based on respect between peoples, the\r\nsovereignty of States, and trust and confidence among\r\nus all.\r\nThe reforms that have been so eagerly awaited\r\nmust apply to the United Nations system as a whole,\r\nand they must embrace the full spectrum of\r\ninternational partnership. To be credible, however, this\r\nrush of optimism must be based on the genuine will of\r\nthe multilateral and bilateral partners. The reforms\r\nmust go hand in hand with, and in practical terms\r\nsupport, States in their development efforts.\r\nI am very pleased here to see the highest leaders\r\nof the world express their willingness to share the joys\r\nand the concerns of our peoples about todays realities.\r\nI am also pleased to see them stress the increasingly\r\ndynamic role that our Organization must play in the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security. Good-neighbourly\r\nrelations are better than ever among peoples in this\r\nworld, driven as it is by a globalization process over\r\nwhich we must exert greater control and which we\r\nmust make more humane.\r\nThis means that the United Nations must listen\r\nmore attentively to each and every inhabitant of the\r\nglobal village; it must listen constantly, completely,\r\nobjectively and impartially, in keeping with the\r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWhen it listens, it must pay heed to the imperative of\r\nparticipation by countries in the decision-making\r\nprocess involving all continents in managing world\r\naffairs.\r\nConflicts anywhere in the world have adverse\r\neffects that are not confined to the theatres of crisis.\r\nTheir consequences are felt world wide. They place a\r\nheavy burden on the lives of every citizen. These are\r\nalways human consequences because they are\r\neconomic and social in nature. In Africa, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity is making major efforts\r\n21\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nto eliminate the hotbeds of tension that are scourging\r\nit. Such activities are costly but necessary. We know\r\nthat they are necessary, and we know that peace is\r\nbeyond price. Peace is the responsibility of States; it is\r\nour responsibility. I wish here to pay well deserved\r\ntribute to our continental organization and to its\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, whose\r\nentire focus is on peace in Africa.\r\nBut peace is a matter for us all, and therefore\r\ncalls for local initiatives. The people of Comoros know\r\nthis, and have put it into practice. The inter-Comorian\r\ndialogue, which I myself initiated, gives us hope for a\r\npeaceful solution to a crisis that has endured for some\r\nthree years. I urge the entire international community\r\nto support us in this process, which will open the way\r\nto a just and equitable solution to the Comorian crisis.\r\nI cannot fail in closing to convey warm\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, on the in-depth reforms he\r\nhas undertaken to modernize the Organization and\r\nimprove its performance. May peace be our objective,\r\nand may we be illuminated by its light.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Sir Mekere Morauta, Prime Minister of\r\nPapua New Guinea.\r\nSir Mekere Morauta (Papua New Guinea): It is\r\nan honour for me to address the Millennium Summit\r\nnot only on behalf of Papua New Guinea, but as a\r\ncitizen of the South Pacific. Although we occupy\r\nthousands of islands remote from global centres such\r\nas this, new forces unleashed by change,\r\ninterdependence and globalization remind us that no\r\nman is an island. Our future is intertwined with the rest\r\nof the world. That is the greatest challenge, and the\r\ngreatest opportunity, that we have faced. The risks are\r\nenormous. Left unmanaged, they threaten our\r\nexistence.\r\nWe have adapted to the first wave of modern\r\nchange, colonialism and the encroachment of the\r\ndeveloped worlds ideas and practices. But that was a\r\nripple in a pond compared with what confronts us\r\ntoday. One of our fathers of independence wrote that he\r\nhad had to deal with 1,000 years of progress in a single\r\nlifetime. He was being conservative. In less than 200\r\nyears, Papua New Guineans have moved through the\r\nmetal age and the industrial age and are now grappling\r\nwith the information age.\r\nBut the cyclonic forces unleashed by the\r\ninformation revolution and globalization have created a\r\ntidal wave that may drown us. Small States such as\r\nPapua New Guinea are already living on the edge. To\r\nus, poverty, illiteracy and illness, conflict and crime,\r\nenvironmental devastation and political instability are\r\nmore than concepts. They are part of our daily lives.\r\nCan the world comprehend the reality of these\r\nsimple facts and develop new structures and processes\r\nto cushion their effects? Pacific island States dependent\r\non natural resources such as fisheries and timber\r\nrequire mechanisms that promote sustainable\r\nexploitation. The United Nations and the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) should take the lead.\r\nPapua New Guinea remains committed to free\r\ntrade and investment by 2020. So we were\r\ndisappointed by the failure to start a new WTO round\r\nin Seattle. Talk of new preferential trading\r\narrangements is also disappointing. Once some nations\r\nare treated as more equal than others, the weakest will\r\nbe neglected. There is already an unacceptable wealth\r\ngap between the developed and the developing worlds.\r\nAllowance must be made for the fact that commitment\r\nby vulnerable economies to free trade and investment\r\nfurther exposes them.\r\nWe are also concerned at the prospect of new\r\nlinks between trade rights and social and environmental\r\nconditions. It is reasonable to expect a commitment to\r\ninternational standards, but it is not reasonable to\r\ncontemplate sanctions against those that are unable to\r\nmeet arbitrarily imposed additional criteria.\r\nIn the longer term, sustained development\r\nrequires the Pacific islands to build robust economies.\r\nPapua New Guinea has begun to do so, increasing\r\ninvestment in human resources and economic\r\ninfrastructure. Pacific islands need capital and\r\ntechnology from the developed world. But the funding\r\nguidelines and policies of multilateral development and\r\nfinancial institutions need to be more flexible and\r\nrelevant to our requirements and our capacity.\r\nOur needs are not confined to trade and\r\ninvestment. For many, our very existence as nations\r\nwill be under threat unless the rising sea level is dealt\r\nwith at once. Not all Governments have accepted the\r\nemissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\r\nand not all will meet the agreed targets. The United\r\n22\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nNations has to orchestrate further efforts with greater\r\nurgency and seriousness.\r\nPapua New Guinea must not only adapt to rapid\r\neconomic, social and environmental transformations. It\r\nfaces political change to the east and the west that is\r\njust as dramatic. It is obvious that mechanisms for\r\ndealing with threats to stability are inadequate. They\r\nneed to be strengthened, not only to resolve conflicts\r\nbut, more important, to prevent them. Our own\r\nexperience on Bougainville and our efforts to help the\r\nSolomon Islands and Fiji arrive at their own solutions\r\nto their crises show that with the cooperation of our\r\nneighbours and multinational bodies, progress can be\r\nmade.\r\nRepresentative bodies and individual States have\r\ntoo often confronted conflict after the event, commonly\r\nwith destructive and expensive political and economic\r\nweapons. Moreover, it is clear that effective\r\nintervention requires an intimate understanding of a\r\ndomestic society. The adoption of this approach in the\r\nSouth Pacific will be a starting point.\r\nThe United Nations itself needs critical self-\r\nappraisal. The lack of attention it has paid to the South-\r\nWest Pacific has already been costly. In particular, the\r\ncircle of the Security Council needs to be expanded to\r\ninclude a voice for Asia and the Pacific.\r\nAll multilateral agencies  not just the agencies\r\nof the United Nations  must rebuild their structures\r\nand processes to reflect the rapidly changing\r\ncircumstances of the world, of regions and of\r\nindividual nations. The price of not doing so is\r\nincreased human suffering, and that is unacceptable.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Royal Highness Prince\r\n′Ulukalala Lavaka Ata, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Defence of the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nPrince ‘Ulukalala Lavaka Ata: This Summit\r\nmarks an historic milestone that with the hindsight of\r\nthe past affords us the opportunity to chart the future\r\ndirection of our Organization by addressing the issues\r\nof concern to our Organization and peoples.\r\nAccordingly, the outcome of this Summit ought to be\r\nmeeting our needs and concerns and the realization of\r\nour collective aspirations.\r\nI congratulate the Secretary-General on the\r\nquality of his report We the Peoples. He poses for us\r\npoignant issues deserving our earnest attention. These\r\nrange from the new challenges to globalization and\r\nfreedom from want and fear, to sustaining our future\r\nand renewing the United Nations. The report\r\nculminates in four significant initiatives: freedom from\r\npoverty, freedom from the scourge of war, freedom\r\nfrom the danger of living on a planet spoiled by human\r\nactivities, and making our Organization a more\r\neffective instrument in the hands of the worlds\r\npeoples. We ought to dedicate our energies, resources\r\nand policies to improving education, protecting our\r\nenvironment, bringing an end to poverty, promoting\r\ngender equality, increasing security and promoting\r\ngood governance, human rights and the rule of law. I\r\ntherefore concur with the issues raised in the report and\r\nthe initiatives that the Secretary-General sets for the\r\nnew century to achieve our priorities, and to this end, I\r\nsee the need for an action-oriented programme.\r\nI welcome the commitment by Member States to\r\ncombat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as I do\r\nthe commitment by the member States of the G-8 to\r\ncancel the debt burden of the heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries. We look forward to this commitments\r\nurgent implementation.\r\nFor the past century and a half, Tonga has\r\ninvested heavily in education. While this has been a\r\nboon for us, we now find it altogether imperative that\r\ndeveloping countries lock onto the information and\r\ncommunication technologies. In this respect, I welcome\r\nthe Ministerial Declaration dealing with information\r\ntechnology of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nWhile my son sees information technology as\r\nthe way to go, it is clearly the way to communicate;\r\nit is a significant means to enhance the education of all\r\nour people, and it enables them to participate in what is\r\nhappening in the world. This, in part, is also the reason\r\nfor our support of the SIDSnet. In particular, I welcome\r\nthe offer of Japan to establish a dedicated information-\r\ntechnology programme in Okinawa and appreciate the\r\nresources they have earmarked for that purpose. The\r\noffer and the mechanics for its operation are deserving\r\nof our thoughtful consideration.\r\nI am cognizant of the special needs of small\r\nisland developing States, needs that ought to be\r\nresolved by implementing the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction and the outcomes of the twenty-second special\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Consequently, we\r\ncall on the international community to make a focused\r\ncommitment to meeting those needs.\r\n23\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nI welcome the inclusion of economic\r\nvulnerability as a factor for determining the least-\r\ndeveloped-country category, but also recognize that\r\nsmall island developing States are vulnerable to\r\nenvironmental changes. I therefore commend to the\r\ndelegations the work on the environmental\r\nvulnerability index currently being carried out by the\r\nSouth Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission, and I\r\nregister my appreciation for those Member States who\r\nhave made available the resources for the completion\r\nof this study.\r\nSmall island developing States are sea-locked,\r\nwith the inherent problems that this entails. They are\r\nacutely vulnerable to globalization, for the benefits are\r\nnot yet equally shared and remain prone to the vagaries\r\nof market forces. They are ocean-bound, so the efforts\r\nto harvest the living and non-living resources of the\r\noceans are especially important to them. Thus, the\r\nactivities this year and in the immediate future of the\r\nStates Parties to the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, of the open-ended informal\r\nconsultative process on oceans and the Law of the Sea,\r\nand of the International Seabed Authority are of utmost\r\nsignificance to small island developing States, and\r\nthese activities form the basis for pursuing\r\narrangements that return a fair share of the harvest.\r\nThe conclusion of the recent Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Review\r\nConference seems to give hope that at some time soon\r\nnuclear disarmament might be possible; however, the\r\nshipment of nuclear waste through the waters of small\r\nisland developing States needs to be regularly\r\nconsidered to ensure that it meets the highest\r\ninternational safety standards.\r\nTonga supports the endeavours of the Security\r\nCouncil and of the General Assembly to find solutions\r\nand bring enduring peace to the troubled regions of the\r\nworld. In supporting the peacekeeping activities of the\r\nUnited Nations, we endorse the call to review the\r\nformula for assessing our contribution on the basis of a\r\nfair and equitable arrangement and on the principle of\r\ncapacity to pay. We also commend to the delegations\r\nthe recommendations of the Brahimi report.\r\nFinally, I support the effort to reform the Security\r\nCouncil through an expansion of the number of\r\npermanent seats and non-permanent seats that would\r\ninclude both developed and developing countries in\r\norder to reflect todays realities and to deal with\r\ntodays needs and pressing issues. Without such reform\r\nwe shall be dealing with todays problems with the\r\nmachinery of yesteryear.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Samdech Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom\r\nof Cambodia.\r\nMr. Hun Sen: I have prepared a long speech for\r\nthis Summit with the intention of apprising this forum\r\nof our aspirations, needs and concerns with regard to\r\nthe challenges to the development of the humanity and\r\nthe creation of a new world order in the age of\r\nglobalization. I have asked for the distribution of the\r\nwhole text for the delegations information.\r\nOverall, there is a common view that humanity\r\nhas witnessed unimaginable, enormous and\r\nimmeasurable changes and progress in the last one\r\nthousand years, in particular during the last century.\r\nYet our achievements also mask many continuing\r\nfailings and seem to give rise to more dangers for the\r\nfuture. Many leaders used to highlight these issues at\r\nimportant international forums. May I pick up for\r\ncomment just a few main concepts, which I think could\r\nmake a contribution to the discussions at this\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nFirst, our biggest concerns at this time are to\r\nrapidly reduce poverty, the gaps between the rich and\r\npoor and the huge economic divide that resulted from\r\nthe negative impacts of globalization, which is under\r\nway and continuing to spread to regions and throughout\r\nthe world. The most important challenge is to provide\r\nopportunity and create conditions for poor countries to\r\nbenefit appropriately from globalization. This requires\r\ngreater transfers of financial, technical and\r\ntechnological resources, so as to provide developing\r\ncountries the opportunity to participate fully and\r\nequally in free trade by providing them with favourable\r\naccess to developed markets without hidden\r\nconditionalities and domestic subsidies.\r\nWe must consider a new partnership between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries to produce\r\nmeasures allowing the latter to meet effectively the\r\nchallenges of globalization. At the same time, special\r\ncare should be taken to design policies and establish a\r\nfavourable environment to promote increased flows of\r\ninvestment, technologies and new knowledge to\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\n24\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nSecondly, as one of the poorest countries in the\r\nworld, we are concerned about the overall decreasing\r\ntrends of official development assistance. We think that\r\nin providing financing facilities, more grant funds\r\nshould be provided to poor countries to boost\r\ndevelopment until they reach a minimum threshold. In\r\nthis sense, we fully support the strides made to fulfil\r\nthe yet to be attained internationally agreed target of\r\n0.7 per cent of the gross national product of the\r\ndeveloped countries for overall official development\r\nassistance as soon as possible.\r\nThirdly, excessive external debt is a heavy burden\r\nfor poor countries and constitutes a major impediment\r\nto economic growth and investment in their human\r\nresource development. The G-8 countries have agreed\r\nto write off the heavy burden of outstanding debt of the\r\npoorest countries. This initiative has been warmly\r\nwelcomed by the people of all walks of life and should\r\nbe further developed by providing extra funds to help\r\nthe heavily indebted poor countries and by expanding\r\nits coverage to many other poor countries.\r\nIn this regard, a number of countries, including\r\nCambodia, have made the utmost efforts to reschedule\r\nold debts, especially those contracted in the 1970s. It\r\nis, however, regrettable that these debts were\r\ncontracted during the cold war to finance the hot wars\r\nin the country and the region. Under those\r\ncircumstances, most of the loans were not utilized for\r\ndevelopment. Therefore, there should be political will\r\nto write off these debts. Some countries appear to have\r\nshared this vision and have adopted this approach by\r\nnot requiring payback. At the same time, we highly\r\nappreciate the generosity of donor countries and\r\ninternational financial institutions in granting new\r\nconcessional loans to poor countries, such as\r\nCambodia, to promote development and reduce\r\npoverty.\r\nFourthly, human resource development is the\r\nmost important and decisive factor for development\r\nand social progress. Thus, priority should be given to\r\nthe enhancement of the capacities of the least\r\ndeveloped countries, such as Cambodia, for them to\r\nachieve the ultimate goals of social and economic\r\ndevelopment and to participate effectively and equally\r\nin regional and world affairs.\r\nFifthly, Cambodia agrees with the initiative to\r\npush for the creation of a new world order by\r\nestablishing a new institution and putting forward a\r\nnew agenda, or improving and redirecting the existing\r\none in order to ensure that all developing countries can\r\nbenefit fairly and equitably from globalization. This\r\nalso includes the necessity to reform the United\r\nNations. The reform of the Security Council should be\r\nconducted in a spirit which allows the United Nations\r\nto discharge its responsibilities in determining the\r\ndestiny of the world more efficiently and with full\r\nlegitimacy in the eyes of nations and peoples in all\r\nregions and at all levels of development. In this sense,\r\nCambodia welcomes the initiative of expanding the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, and expresses full\r\nsupport for Japan and India as candidates to occupy\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council.\r\nI am confident that this Millennium Summit will\r\nreaffirm the commitments of all Member States in\r\nrespect of the common visions for the world in the new\r\nmillennium. We will all show our strong determination\r\nabout this commitment through follow-up actions to be\r\ntaken after the Summit.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Göran\r\nPersson, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sweden.\r\nMr. Persson (Sweden): We are living at a historic\r\njuncture where global progress is a real possibility: a\r\ncombined wealth never seen before; scientific advances\r\nin medicine and technology; political freedom and\r\ndemocratic accountability becoming the norm; an end\r\nto the belief that States have inherent enemies; access\r\nto many cultures and the inspiration of diversity; and\r\nsocial liberation for entire populations, and for women\r\nin particular.\r\nThere are good reasons for optimism, or even\r\npride, but not for satisfaction. Human progress should\r\nbe measured not by the achievements of the most\r\nprivileged, but by the life that the most disadvantaged\r\namong us can live and enjoy.\r\nWe are painfully aware that a great part of\r\nhumankind is left behind progress, each and every day\r\nhaving to struggle for survival and justice. Poverty is\r\nthe prime challenge of this Summit and the backdrop of\r\nall international efforts.\r\nWe, the peoples, have enough knowledge and\r\nresources to act as responsible citizens of the world.\r\nOur task as leaders is to provide the political, social\r\nand economic context.\r\n25\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nRepresenting one of the richer countries in the\r\nworld, known for its stable democratic tradition, I have\r\nto highlight a threat to our ability to take common\r\nresponsibility. In many democracies, democracy itself\r\nis questioned. Too many do not care to vote and resent\r\npolitical participation. Social rifts and unemployment\r\nare sowing distrust. Dark forces of racism and anti-\r\nsemitism are harvesting support. Some blame\r\nunfettered globalization and come to hail insular\r\nnationalism.\r\nThis Summit can point in a more hopeful\r\ndirection. It can become a reference for all those\r\nwilling to act together for a better future. The future is\r\nnot decreed by fate; it is people in cooperation that\r\nshape it.\r\nThe choice is ours. Some say that equality is a\r\nbrake on development. But take a look around: nations\r\nthat put the tools of development in the hands of all\r\npeople are making more lasting progress. A well-\r\neducated population, fair distribution of income, a\r\nsocial safety system encouraging enterprise and\r\nmobility  those are keys to success in the new\r\neconomy.\r\nAnd now globalization calls for a wider social\r\ncontract, making market forces serve people better.\r\nWhen home again, can we match words with\r\ndeeds? Systematic efforts and consistent political will\r\nare essential. Our Secretary-General is providing\r\ninvaluable and persistent leadership. His Millennium\r\nReport serves as an excellent reference for checking\r\nwhether our homework has been properly done.\r\nHave we come closer to halving extreme poverty\r\nby 2015? This is a goal for which debt relief is\r\nnecessary. What about providing clean drinking water\r\nand air? Or education for all children, investing as\r\nmuch in girls as in boys? Are we responding well\r\nenough to disastrous climate change and killer diseases\r\nlike HIV/AIDS? Are we tackling organized crime and\r\ncorruption? Do we respect the free will of our people,\r\nenforcing universally applicable human rights? Do we\r\nseek to encourage participation in new and old\r\ndemocracies alike? What about guarding conventions\r\nwe have signed, disarming as we have declared, and\r\npreventing conflicts or resolving them with arguments\r\nrather than arms?\r\nThe United Nations needs the renewed strength of\r\npeoples trust and their mandate in order to be a\r\npurposeful organization with adequate resources. Are\r\nwe paying our fees before profiting? Are we honouring\r\nour commitments to aid development? And to\r\npeacekeeping, a duty well spelled out in the Brahimi\r\nreport, which deserves everyones full support.\r\nColleagues, the answer should be a resounding \r\nYes! There is no room for hesitation. Only resolute\r\nsteps taken down these already agreed upon paths can\r\nrestore confidence in the unity of nations to defend\r\nhumanity  all of humanity.\r\nPresent and aspiring members of the reformed,\r\nenlarged Security Council that we need must live up to\r\nthe trust we place in them  a restricted veto  a\r\nfarewell to nuclear arms  more sophisticated\r\nsanctions.\r\nEquality and development go hand in hand.\r\nDevelopment will be stronger when everyone is part of\r\nit. We will all be better off if no one is left out. We\r\nhave a future; we have it in common. This should be\r\nthe powerful message of the Millennium Summit.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Poul\r\nNyrup Rasmussen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nDenmark.\r\nMr. Rasmussen (Denmark): The United Nations\r\nis the sum of our efforts, our commitments, our\r\ncontributions. The United Nations is what member\r\ncountries make it. Our guiding light should be equal\r\nworth and social fairness for everybody. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has delivered, to my mind, the analysis of the\r\nglobal trends we face. The Secretary-General has made\r\na strong case for the future of the United Nations.\r\nGlobal problems have to be tackled globally; therefore,\r\nwe need a stronger United Nations.\r\nLet me add that globalization cannot only be\r\nlarger markets. Around the world, untold millions live\r\nin poverty, at the outskirts of change, where the future\r\nseems a dead-end street. Africa, in particular, seems\r\nlocked in a vicious circle of desolation and despair. No\r\none  no one  can justify fatalistic and cynical\r\nacceptance. We must act; and we must support Africas\r\nrenaissance. Investments, transfer of knowledge and\r\nresources are necessary for development in Africa.\r\nWe need to create a human framework for the\r\ninternational market forces of the economy, as we have\r\ndone in our national economies. We need to put people\r\nbefore money and the market. When multinational\r\n26\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\ncorporations make money at the expense of social\r\nprogress, we have an obligation to provide the right\r\nbalance. There can never be an exchange rate between\r\nmoney and human suffering.\r\nAt the Copenhagen Summit in 1995, poverty and\r\nsocial progress were at the top of the development\r\nagenda. May I underline that only if the private and the\r\npublic sectors work hand-in-hand to ensure an even\r\ndistribution of the benefits will we be able to realize\r\nthe truly global promise of globalization.\r\nThe United Nations is what we, the leaders, want\r\nit to be. Our support forms the destiny of the United\r\nNations. We need to do more.\r\nI welcome the emphasis on global solidarity and\r\nsocial responsibility in the Secretary-Generals report.\r\nThe least developed countries need action on trade,\r\ndebt, and aid in order to catch up. Developing countries\r\nshould enjoy the advantages of international trade.\r\nSubstantially improved market access for their\r\nproducts  and in my view, all their products \r\nshould be at the centre of the upcoming World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Round. Everybody should honour\r\nthe demands and requirements of the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO) concerning labour rights.\r\nWe, from the richer part of the world, should assist\r\ndeveloping countries to realize those concerns.\r\nDebt relief has the potential to make substantial\r\nresources available for investment in poverty\r\nreduction, education, and health. Both bilaterally and\r\nmultilaterally, creditors should cover their share of the\r\ncosts. The long-term decline in aid needs to be\r\nreversed. Far  and I underline, far  too few\r\ncountries live up to our modest commitment. If\r\nDenmark, my country, can meet and exceed the targets,\r\nothers may as well. The United Nations process of\r\nfinancing for development offers an opportunity for\r\nrenewed commitment and action. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral can count on our support.\r\nBut I also have to underline that debt, aid or trade\r\nare not separate issues. Improving one and cutting back\r\non another is meaningless. We can only make\r\ndevelopment sustainable if we take a coherent\r\napproach. Therefore, I urge those countries that could\r\nreally make a difference  countries among the most\r\ndeveloped and fortunate  to make an extra effort.\r\nFollowing the Rio Summit in 1992, it is evident\r\nthat sustainable development is the sum of many parts,\r\nincluding social, economic and environmental aspects.\r\nHeads of State and Government should come\r\ntogether and discuss the next steps to be taken. We\r\nmust promote an agenda for further cooperation with a\r\nstronger emphasis on the needs of the developing\r\ncountries. We have to narrow the gap between rich and\r\npoor. This requires a major effort by the industrialized\r\ncountries and, let us be honest at this Millennium\r\nSummit, too many times we have set new deadlines to\r\nreach old goals. Now is the time to act. Now is the time\r\nto let action follow words.\r\nEffective cooperation requires solidarity and a\r\nstrong, well-functioning United Nations. We want an\r\neffective United Nations capable of meeting its\r\nmandate. We need reforms and dues need to be paid by\r\neverybody. That includes both small and big nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General deserves credit for making\r\nthe United Nations both leaner and more effective. His\r\nquiet revolution of 1997 must maintain momentum.\r\nNow is the time to dismantle obsolete bodies and\r\nactivities. The Secretary-General can count on\r\nDenmarks support.\r\nReform of the Security Council is overdue as\r\nwell. The number of both permanent and elected\r\nmembers reflects the past. It should reflect the present\r\nand the future.\r\nThe United Nations needs a sizeable and robust\r\ncapacity for peace operations. It must be able to\r\nrespond quickly and with credible force. The report\r\nfrom Ambassador Brahimis panel provides both a\r\nstrong case and frank recommendations for putting\r\nthings right. The Secretary-General can count on our\r\nsupport. And let me add that those committed\r\nindividuals who every day serve the United Nations as\r\npeacekeepers or humanitarian workers have a right, a\r\nright to safety and protection. The very recent atrocious\r\nmurders in West Timor is another sad reminder of this\r\nneed.\r\nBut preventive actions should always come first.\r\nThus, I am pleased to announce, therefore, that a\r\nDanish contribution of $l million to the Trust Fund for\r\nPreventive Action has been decided.\r\nFor almost half a century, the United Nations has\r\nremained our pre-eminent common forum for\r\npromoting peace and social progress. In this spirit I\r\n27\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nwelcome the recent landmark decision to establish a\r\npermanent forum for indigenous issues.\r\nMay I conclude by saying that it would be unfair\r\nto blame the United Nations for having failed our\r\nexpectations. The fact remains that only if we, the\r\nleaders of the world, are ready, individually and\r\ncollectively, to take action, only if we give the United\r\nNations the necessary authority and adequate\r\nresources, only then can we move forward towards a\r\nbetter world for all.\r\nLet us recognize today that we can do better, all\r\nof us, together.\r\nAs I said in my introduction, the United Nations\r\nis the sum of our efforts, our commitments and our\r\ncontributions.\r\nDenmark remains ready to assume her share of\r\nthis responsibility and I urge all colleagues to do the\r\nsame.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency, the\r\nHonourable Edward Fenech-Adami, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Malta.\r\nMr. Fenech-Adami (Malta): Homer, the first\r\ngreat poet of humanity, chose the state of siege as the\r\nbasic image of the human condition in his first epic, the\r\nIliad. He later moved to another metaphor for human\r\nlife in his second epic, the Odyssey, where human\r\nexistence becomes a sea voyage as opposed to one\r\nmarked by the stagnation and corruption which can so\r\noften produce war.\r\nI believe that there has been a somewhat similar\r\nchange in the worlds self-image as indicated in the\r\nSecretary-Generals report. The root of this change\r\nclearly stems from a desire to distance ourselves from\r\nthe siege mentality out of which the Organization was\r\ninevitably born, and to begin the new Millennium\r\naware that we  the whole of humanity  are\r\nembarked on the same voyage, on the same ship, and\r\nwith very similar, if not precisely, the same goals.\r\nThe Secretary-Generals report also embodies full\r\nrecognition of the interconnectedness of the economic,\r\nenvironmental and ethical dimensions of global\r\nsecurity. It focuses on current developments that, to a\r\nlarge extent, may be termed issues of common interest,\r\nissues that form part of the common heritage of\r\nmankind. The Summit commitment to ensure free\r\naccess to information on the human genome sequence\r\nis indeed very welcome in this regard.\r\nGlobalization is clearly and rapidly emerging as\r\nan impressive force that offers potentially positive\r\nopportunities in the economies of the world. It is,\r\nhowever, not a panacea that can be expected to resolve\r\nall the challenges caused by underdevelopment. The\r\nbenefits therefrom, if equitably distributed, could and\r\nwould help the healing process of the wounds opened\r\nby the devastating consequences of underdevelopment\r\nand poverty.\r\nGlobalization has served to heighten our\r\ninterdependence. It has helped us to realize that no\r\ncountrys problems are strictly its own. Its onset has,\r\nhowever, coincided with changes in our manifestations\r\nof the value of solidarity. At home many of us are\r\nreassessing the viability of our welfare systems while\r\nabroad official development assistance has fallen rather\r\nthan risen.\r\nGlobalization must not be allowed to overwhelm\r\nour value of solidarity but rather allow for a new vision\r\nof this fundamental value for the new century.\r\nSolidarity must have new manifestations whereby\r\nadvances in various fields, including those of science\r\nand medicine, are shared because in an interdependent\r\nworld it is in our common interest that they are so\r\nshared.\r\nWe have to act swiftly to prevent a widening of\r\nthe digital divide between the globalized few and the\r\nmarginalized many. Failing to do so would ensure the\r\nfurther exacerbation of the scourge of poverty that\r\noften, indeed too often, is the root cause of most\r\nconflicts.\r\nEqually important is the reaffirmation of our\r\ncommitment to the United Nations and its Charter as\r\nthe foundation of a more peaceful, prosperous and just\r\nworld. Our final declaration at this Millennium Summit\r\ncarries with it a commitment to make the United\r\nNations a more effective instrument, an instrument that\r\ncan promote the forces necessary for change. To ensure\r\nthat the United Nations can do this, however, it has to\r\nhave the necessary means at its disposal.\r\nAt present, the United Nations is effecting both\r\ninternal and external reforms to ensure that it has\r\nadequate resources to meet its mandates. An area,\r\nwhich exacts an ever-increasing demand on resources,\r\nis the United Nations peacekeeping role. I would like\r\n28\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nto express Maltas support for the initiatives under way\r\nin this respect. I hereby signal our intention to\r\nsignificantly increase our peacekeeping contribution\r\nthrough a voluntary move from group C to group B.\r\nI would also like to offer Maltas commitment to\r\nthe World Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,\r\nscheduled for late next year. My Government\r\nundertakes not only to sign the declaration entitled\r\nTolerance and diversity  A vision for the 21st\r\ncentury, but also to ensure that we have a valid and\r\nrelevant contribution to make at the convening of that\r\nConference.\r\nI would like to end by confirming Maltas\r\ncommitment to the underlying principles of this\r\nOrganization and our trust that this Millennium\r\nSummit will provide the impetus to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations becomes a more effective instrument in\r\nthe hands of we, the peoples of the United Nations, not\r\nsolely in words but also in deeds.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill next hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Atal\r\nBehari Vajpayee, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nIndia.\r\nMr. Vajpayee (India) (spoke in Hindi;\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to address the Millennium Summit of the\r\nUnited Nations. My heartiest congratulations to both of\r\nthe Co-Chairpersons.\r\nWe are gathered here to voice the aspirations and\r\ndreams of 6 billion people for the twenty-first century.\r\nWe cannot have development without peace between\r\nnations and democracy within them. Peace, democracy\r\nand development secure each other.\r\nThe danger of nuclear war remains a serious\r\nthreat to global peace and security in the new era\r\nwhose arrival is marked by this Summit. During the\r\nlast half of the century gone by, India was at the\r\nforefront of the campaign for universal nuclear\r\ndisarmament, but we raised our voice to no avail. India\r\nwas forced to develop these weapons in 1998 because\r\nthe principal nuclear-weapon States refused to accept\r\nthe almost-universal demand for disarmament.\r\nMoreover, the spread of nuclear weapons in our\r\nneighbourhood made us especially vulnerable.\r\nIndias bitter experience has taught it that it has to\r\nbe strong to defend peace. Nevertheless, our policy is\r\nbased on responsibility and restraint, and our\r\ncommitment to universal, verifiable nuclear\r\ndisarmament remains undiminished. We support the\r\nSecretary-Generals proposal for an international\r\nconference to address nuclear dangers.\r\nOf all threats to democracy, development and\r\npeace in our times, the most diabolic is international\r\nterrorism, with its links to religious extremism, drug\r\ntrafficking and commerce in illicit arms. Terrorism\r\nfeeds on violence against innocent people and seeks to\r\nundermine pluralistic, open societies.\r\nStanding before this gathering of leaders who\r\nhave come together to chart a new course of\r\ninternational cooperation in the twenty-first century, I\r\ncall upon the international community to act against\r\nterrorism before it is too late. We urge the early\r\nadoption and implementation of the comprehensive\r\nconvention against terrorism that will be negotiated at\r\nthe session of the General Assembly that follows this\r\nSummit.\r\nMany statesmanlike words have been delivered\r\nfrom this high tribune. Unfortunately, some of them are\r\na mockery of the truth. The world must see reality as it\r\nis. The acid test of sincerity of purpose is not words but\r\ndeeds. Terrorism and dialogue do not go together.\r\nIn the last half-century, the world has changed, as\r\nhas the international order. But these changes are not\r\nreflected in the structure of the Security Council, which\r\nwill continue to have a rather special role to play in the\r\nnew century. Therefore, it is necessary that the Security\r\nCouncil should be more representative of the new\r\nrealities. India is ready to play its role in an expanded\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThis is a unique Summit, being held at a unique\r\npoint in history. As the world transits from one era to\r\nanother, let us pledge to bring nations together in a\r\nglobal family, united by peace and prosperity.\r\nI end with an ancient Indian invocation:\r\nMay all live happily\r\nMay all enjoy good health\r\nMay all see auspiciousness\r\nMay none experience distress\r\nMay peace prevail everywhere!\r\n29\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Yeshey\r\nZimba, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the\r\nKingdom of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Zimba (Bhutan): It gives me great pleasure\r\nto felicitate the two leaders who have been elected to\r\njointly and equally preside over the Millennium\r\nSummit. Their representation of separate geographic\r\nregions and cultural and economic backgrounds is an\r\nexpression of our collective will to usher in an era of\r\ngreater understanding, peace and cooperation in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nI would also like to express my delegations\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor his concise report, which is both reflective and\r\nstimulating. It fulfils the expectation of a\r\ncomprehensive basis for our common endeavour to\r\nenvision the future of our planet in the new century.\r\nIt is now five years since we celebrated the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, and a new\r\nmillennium has begun. Yet the world is still not rid of\r\nthe scourge of war, and there continues to prevail those\r\nvery causes which compel sections of our society to\r\nseek change through the perpetration of violence\r\nagainst each other. These include insecurity, inequities,\r\npoverty and despair. But does this mean that the United\r\nNations has failed? Certainly not.\r\nFor all its imperfections, the United Nations is an\r\ninstitution for which there is no alternative. It has given\r\nhope in times of instability, crisis and war. For the\r\nsmaller and more vulnerable nations, the world body\r\nhas served to safeguard sovereignty and freedom.\r\nAbove all, the United Nations today is vital to the\r\npromotion and conduct of international relations and\r\nbehaviour. The wisdom of committing ourselves to the\r\nstrengthening of our Organization must therefore be\r\nupheld.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, I would urge that the time\r\nhas come to do more than pay lip service to the reform\r\nand expansion of the Security Council. Let us work to\r\nmake it happen. Let us ensure that, among other things,\r\nthe United Nations is on firm financial footing and that\r\nthere is equitable geographic representation of\r\npermanent members in the Council.\r\nGlobalization is a revolution that is all-embracing\r\nand irreversible. We in Bhutan accept it as a natural\r\noutcome of the continuing evolution of human society,\r\naccelerated by the miracles of technology. We believe\r\nthat, just as all human institutions and cultural\r\nexpressions are of our own making, so must the\r\ndirection, pace and impact of globalization be guided\r\nto ensure that it serves to enhance our greater common\r\ninterests and values.\r\nThe alleviation of material poverty and spiritual\r\nhunger, which undermine human dignity and the value\r\nof human life, remains a great challenge for all our\r\nGovernments. We see people-centred, holistic\r\ndevelopment as an effective way to overcome the\r\nproblem. In this context, Bhutan has evolved a\r\nphilosophy and concept of development aimed at\r\npromoting gross national happiness  not just\r\nsimply gross national product. Besides socio-economic\r\ndevelopment under conditions of equity and\r\nsustainability, it prescribes environmental conservation,\r\nthe promotion of basic human values and good\r\ngovernance. It requires that, in the process of\r\npromoting development and ensuring freedom from the\r\nuncertainty of survival and want of basic needs,\r\nhumanity must not lose its soul.\r\nWhen we speak about the eradication of poverty,\r\npeacekeeping, or the promotion of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, finance is a constraining factor, not\r\nbecause of an absolute lack of it, but for want of a\r\ngreater political will to share available resources. In\r\nthis regard, we must not be oblivious to the\r\ndiminishing role and capacity of the United Nations,\r\ndue mainly to lack of support and funds. My delegation\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank and\r\ncommend the few developed countries that have met or\r\nsurpassed the internationally agreed official\r\ndevelopment assistance annual disbursement target of\r\n0.7 per cent of gross domestic product, and we appeal\r\nto others to do the same.\r\nPeace and security are prerequisites for human\r\ncreativity and productivity. These are the foundations\r\nfor social and economic advancement. This Summit is\r\nhistoric not only in the context of the new millennium\r\nbut because of the affirmation of the relevance and\r\nimportance of this world body by the largest-ever\r\nnumber of heads of State or Government in its history.\r\nThis, then, is the moment to rededicate and commit our\r\ncountries and peoples to the high aims and ideals of the\r\nUnited Nations. Let this be the occasion from which\r\nwill rise a more purposeful, strong and effective United\r\nNations  a United Nations that will succeed in\r\n30\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\ncreating the preconditions for human growth and\r\nhappiness.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Julio\r\nCésar Franco, Vice-President of the Republic of\r\nParaguay.\r\nMr. Franco (Paraguay): It is a great pleasure for\r\nme  as well as for my country, Paraguay  to be\r\nhere in this Hall and to participate in this lofty forum\r\nof heads of State and representatives, who are gathered\r\nhere with the goal of establishing a link between\r\npolicy-making and deliberation.\r\nThe beginning of this millennium is more than\r\njust a date in history. It is providing us with the\r\nopportunity to rethink our policies and to anticipate the\r\nchanges our countries will have to make in order to\r\nachieve a level of sustainable development that\r\nrespects human dignity and the need to preserve the\r\necosystem.\r\nThe recognition of the need for reform and to\r\neffect change, both domestically and internationally, is\r\na sign of the times. The complexity of our global world\r\nis such that nothing is certain and nothing is stable.\r\nGlobal society requires us to adopt a development\r\nmodel in our countries that not only takes account of\r\nour comparative advantages but also attaches\r\nimportance to the development of competitive\r\nadvantages.\r\nDeveloping countries such as mine, with their\r\nweak infrastructures, must be prepared to meet the\r\nchallenges of a global society that is characterized by a\r\npolitical and military hierarchy, social stratification and\r\nasymmetrical interdependence.\r\nWithout discounting the external factors that\r\nnegatively affect our development opportunities, I\r\nwould urge that countries with a more limited capacity,\r\nsuch as mine, elaborate a development strategy that\r\nenhances the capacity of our domestic institutions.\r\nWe need to focus on our endogenous processes\r\nand enhance their efficiency and effectiveness. Our\r\nchallenge is to create institutional models and adopt\r\npolitical management styles that will enable us, from a\r\ncomprehensive development perspective, to promote\r\npublic policies that give priority to economic growth,\r\nthe equitable distribution of wealth, environmental\r\npreservation and the achievement of gender equality.\r\nWe must reaffirm our commitment to the human\r\ndevelopment paradigm. This will require us to rethink\r\nand re-evaluate the mechanisms and courses of action\r\nnecessary for us to set up institutional arrangements\r\nthat promote social participation, give greater\r\nresponsibility to civil society and establish machinery\r\nthat will enable us to transform, in an equitable\r\nmanner, our individual and collective efforts into social\r\nprogress.\r\nWe must focus with all our will on preparing a\r\nmodel for society in which political stability and\r\neconomic growth leave no room for inequality and\r\nsocial exclusion. The immediate target of our collective\r\neffort must be on meeting social demands. Poverty and\r\nmarginalization violate the principles of the ethic of\r\nsolidarity, obstruct opportunities for democratic\r\ndevelopment and stifle the will and the progressive and\r\nentrepreneurial spirit of our societies. The breakdown\r\nof society internalizes the sense of irrelevance, the\r\nanomy, of national communities and weakens\r\nindividual commitment to the common, collective\r\nfuture. Societies that lose their sense of identity are\r\nless able to rise to the challenge of global capitalism.\r\nIn that context, I take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nParaguays position with regard to the entry of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan as a full Member in the\r\nUnited Nations. Paraguay requests once again that this\r\ndemocratic and progressive country be made part of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nSimilarly, we believe that the re-establishment of\r\ndialogue between the United Kingdom and the\r\nArgentine Republic on the Malvinas Islands is essential\r\nto finding a peaceful and lawful solution to that\r\nproblem.\r\nFinally, I wish to refer once more to the dawn of\r\nthe new millennium. At the start of any new era,\r\noptimism struggles with pessimism. There are reasons\r\nfor skepticism and justification for the disillusionment\r\nof those who claim there is no hope. We believe that\r\nthere is a need to enhance the quality of our policy-\r\nmaking and we need to consider that this involves more\r\nthan a mere struggle for power. It requires us to focus\r\non creating material and moral conditions that are not\r\nhostile to the full exercise of human rights in this\r\nworld.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by Her Excellency Mrs. Lydie\r\n31\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nPolfer, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Luxembourg.\r\nMrs. Polfer (Luxembourg) (spoke in French):\r\nThe gathering in New York of the leaders of the\r\npeoples of our planet is a powerful gesture, because it\r\nbroadcasts the image of a common will, an affirmation\r\nof unity and the interdependence of our nations.\r\nThis meeting is important. We need landmarks to\r\nappreciate what unites us and to measure the distances\r\nthat separate us. If they can be measured, they become\r\nless daunting.\r\nKofi Annan spoke to us of the potential of\r\nfreedom in the face of fear, hunger, disease and\r\nignorance. Will the wise man be heard? Societies long\r\nago defined the instrument that provides a lasting hold\r\nover the happiness that wisdom brings: these are rights\r\nand their issue, the law  not the law of the strongest,\r\nbut that which defines and accepts partners equal in\r\nrights. International legality, on which the actions of\r\ninternational society are based, is certainly not an\r\nimmutable principle. International society, like the\r\nsocieties of different States, is constantly evolving. It is\r\nup to us to ensure that our actions and the instruments\r\navailable to us to implement them are adequately\r\nadapted.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the\r\naspiration to peace and prosperity remains at the heart\r\nof our commitment, while many sources of tension\r\npersist throughout the world. In recent decades, our\r\nOrganization has developed its activities to control\r\nthese crises, either by deploying United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations or by launching international\r\ncrisis-management actions in cooperation with regional\r\norganizations. The results of these efforts have been\r\nmixed and should be critically assessed with a view to\r\nimproving their effectiveness in the future. The role of\r\nthe United Nations, however, cannot be limited to that\r\nof an international fire brigade.\r\nWith the Brahimi report, our Organization has\r\nundertaken a global exercise of reflection on the way in\r\nwhich it addresses conflict and we must develop a\r\nglobal international crisis-management strategy on the\r\nbasis of this reflection. We will need greater\r\nimagination and perseverance and to devote our joint\r\nefforts to improving conflict prevention.\r\nOne of the best ways of achieving this objective\r\nin the years to come will be to pursue our action on\r\nbehalf of balanced and sustainable development, which\r\nreduces disparities between the various continents and\r\nwhich will be reflected in an effective improvement of\r\nthe living standards of the populations concerned. In\r\nthis context, the fight against poverty is one of the\r\ncentral axes of international action. I wish to inform\r\nthe Assembly that, beginning this year, my country will\r\ndevote 0.7 per cent of its gross national product to\r\nofficial development assistance programmes.\r\nThe ongoing process of the globalization of the\r\neconomy should offer new opportunities to working\r\nand thinking people and to entrepreneurial freedom in\r\nthe context of systems that are better balanced and\r\nendowed with effective self-monitoring mechanisms.\r\nGlobalization will be a success only if the international\r\ncommunity can develop the regulatory framework\r\nnecessary to give countries and social groups a more\r\nharmonious and equitable access to the incredible\r\nopportunities offered by communication technologies.\r\nThe promotion of the values of peace, justice and\r\nsolidarity is another essential pillar of United Nations\r\naction. In the course of recent years, our Organization\r\nhas striven to codify through international conventions\r\nthe principal rights and duties that permit the\r\ndevelopment of democratic and tolerant societies which\r\naccept differences and respect the individual.\r\nIndeed, the tragedies that continue to afflict far\r\ntoo many regions of our planet result not from the\r\ndifferences between individuals and peoples, but from\r\nthe lack of respect of some for others. Contempt and\r\ndenial of equality are incompatible with the building of\r\na stable society, be it at the national or the international\r\nlevel.\r\nWithout a deep-rooted sense of equality, how can\r\nwe imagine authentic, sincere and staunch harmony\r\nbetween groups and peoples, regions and countries,\r\nnations and States? Without a confidence rooted in the\r\nmost diverse cultures, languages and traditions, how\r\ncan we bring ourselves to accept an outstretched hand?\r\nHow can we act without trust, how can we share the\r\nburden of decision-making without mutual\r\nrecognition?\r\nIt will be up to the instrument of the United\r\nNations system  which is incomparable because\r\nuniversal  to endow itself with the means to ensure\r\nthat these rights and values are effectively implemented\r\nand benefit those for whom they are destined. In order\r\nto discharge better in the future the important tasks that\r\n32\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nhave been assigned to it, the United Nations will have\r\nto pursue and intensify the internal reform that has\r\nbeen begun and overhaul relations between its various\r\norgans: the General Assembly, where we all meet\r\ntogether; the Security Council, which should be\r\nenlarged in order to be more representative; and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, which should be\r\nrevitalized.\r\nBut the responsibility for this necessary effort of\r\nadaptation cannot be limited to the initiative of our\r\nSecretary-General and to the work and commitment of\r\nour representatives here in New York. Such a\r\ncommitment must necessarily concentrate the\r\ndetermination of Governments and will also require the\r\ncooperation and assistance of civil society, whose\r\ncontribution is invaluable.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to express the hope that\r\nthe Millennium Summit will be an important stage\r\nalong the road to the achievement of our common\r\nobjective of an international society that is more just,\r\nmore equitable and more tolerant, and has greater\r\nsolidarity, for the common good of the peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Eriya\r\nKategaya, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uganda.\r\nMr. Kategaya (Uganda): This is a historic\r\nmoment ripe with opportunities and challenges. The\r\nlast hundred years have seen tremendous developments\r\nin science and technology, and man has made\r\nsignificant progress. Yet at the same time the majority\r\nof humankind still does not enjoy the fruits of that\r\nprogress, for a number of reasons, one being the lack of\r\npeace and another poverty.\r\nWe, the leaders gathered here, have an obligation\r\nto ensure that a conducive environment for peace is\r\ncreated and sustained. We must therefore deal seriously\r\nwith the root causes of conflict and act to prevent those\r\ncauses by promoting good governance and accessibility\r\nof opportunities for every citizen.\r\nThe international community must remember that\r\nthe most horrendous violations of human rights in this\r\ncentury, the Holocaust against the Jews and the\r\ngenocide in Rwanda and Kosovo, were the creation of\r\na leadership that instigated ethnic hatred and religious\r\nintolerance. We must therefore collectively develop\r\nzero tolerance for such leadership. In the words behind\r\nthe United Nations Charter Never again must be\r\nNever again.\r\nPoverty eradication is yet another challenge that\r\nwe face. The majority of people living in poverty are in\r\ndeveloping countries. The celebrated globalization\r\npresents many opportunities, but has always presented\r\nunfair terms of trade. In our view, globalization has\r\nalways existed. The era of the slave trade, when human\r\nbeings were exchanged for trinkets and whisky, was a\r\nform of globalization, but an unfair one. It was an\r\nexchange of value for no value. What is needed,\r\ntherefore, are fair terms of trade.\r\nHowever, fair terms of trade are not enough. For\r\nus, as developing countries, the era of being mere\r\nproducers of raw materials must come to an end. We\r\nmust focus on adding value to all goods before putting\r\nthem on the market. This, in our view, is the only way\r\neverybody can benefit from globalization and, in the\r\nlong run, eradicate poverty. We must work to ensure\r\nthat nobody continues to live in abject poverty.\r\nGlobalization should not leave any country or anybody\r\nbehind.\r\nWith respect to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, it is our\r\nexperience that this is a multisectoral problem that\r\nthrives best in poverty. It is therefore not surprising\r\nthat the most alarming rates of HIV/AIDS infection are\r\nin sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Poor diet and poor\r\nmedical services or a lack of them, contribute to\r\nmaking the situation worse. Even where medical\r\nfacilities are available, the cost of drugs is so\r\nprohibitive that only a few privileged people can afford\r\ntreatment. There is therefore a need for a deliberate\r\neffort to make these drugs affordable. This is our moral\r\nobligation.\r\nAlthough, we would not like to advocate debt\r\nforgiveness per se, the debt burden is a real problem,\r\nbecause the resources spent on repaying the debts\r\nshould be used for investing in poverty eradication\r\nprogrammes, education and health. We also need to\r\nmobilize new and additional resources to address such\r\nissues as appropriate technological transfers, increasing\r\nagricultural productivity and, most urgently, the\r\nindustrialization of developing countries and their\r\ntransformation from largely peasant societies into\r\nmiddle-class societies.\r\nWhile welcoming the recent initiative by the G-7\r\nto significantly reduce the debt burden of highly\r\n33\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nindebted countries, the initiative itself is not a panacea\r\nfor the problems of development. The relief will\r\nprovide the poor countries with the fiscal resources to\r\nincrease spending on poverty eradication programmes,\r\nbut the effective exit from debt problems will require\r\nrich countries to open up their markets to exports from\r\npoor countries.\r\nIn the medium- and long-run, what will get poor\r\ncountries out of the aid/poverty trap is investment and\r\ntrade. The private sectors of developing countries must\r\nbe promoted and strengthened. Therefore, developed\r\ncountries must fully open their markets to us. However,\r\nhighly indebted poor countries should increase their\r\nproduction capacity so that once there is market access\r\nthere are goods available for supply. It goes without\r\nsaying that without the availability of goods, trade is\r\nimpossible. Countries cannot trade what they do not\r\nproduce.\r\nThe lesson to be learned from our experience in\r\nUganda is that debt relief is necessary to free up\r\nresources for investment and poverty eradication. But,\r\nif it is to be effective in improving economic and social\r\nconditions in the poorest countries, it must be\r\naccompanied by sound domestic economic and\r\nbudgetary policies.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Surin\r\nPitsuwan, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand.\r\nMr. Pitsuwan (Thailand): Allow me first to\r\ncommend the far-sighted initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in organizing this historic Millennium Summit\r\nand producing a most insightful report (A/54/2000)\r\nwhich serves as an excellent basis for our current\r\ndeliberations. On the whole, Thailand is supportive of\r\nthe principles and recommendations laid out in the\r\nSecretary-Generals timely report, We the peoples ...,\r\nparticularly his emphasis on human-centred\r\ndevelopment. The report rightly identifies the new\r\nchallenges confronting us all as we enter the new\r\ncentury.\r\nIn Thailands view, such challenges are of far-\r\nreaching magnitude and scope, ranging from a complex\r\nphenomenon such as globalization all the way to the\r\nmore immediate problem of high energy and oil prices\r\non the present world market. We in Thailand are deeply\r\nconcerned about the negative repercussions of high oil\r\nprices on the global economy. It is our earnest hope\r\nthat the international community will be able to find a\r\nmutually satisfactory resolution to this problem before\r\nit gets out of hand and leads to another worldwide\r\neconomic crisis.\r\nAs we prepare to face the intricate challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century, we must all do our part to\r\nmake this a better world in which to live. As far as\r\nThailand is concerned, we have striven to play a\r\nconstructive role and to make a meaningful\r\ncontribution to global peace and prosperity.\r\nIn the international arena, Thailand has sought to\r\nplay a proactive role in achieving a more just and\r\nequitable global order. In this quest, our Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Commerce, Mr. Supachai\r\nPanitchpakdi, will be assuming the post of Director-\r\nGeneral of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in\r\nSeptember 2002. We also helped foster the Spirit of\r\nBangkok during the successful tenth session of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) earlier this year in our common effort to\r\nforge better understanding and help bridge the\r\ndangerous gap between the developed and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nAlong the same lines, Thailand also supports\r\nthe convening of a high-level international\r\nintergovernmental event on financing for development\r\nat the highest level possible next year, in the belief that\r\nsuch a conference would help address the national,\r\ninternational and systemic issues relating to financing\r\nfor development in a holistic manner.\r\nIn the political sphere, Thailand has strongly\r\nsupported and participated in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in virtually all regions of the\r\nworld. We are honoured that a Thai military officer,\r\nLieutenant-General Boonsrang Niumpradit, has been\r\nappointed Force Commander of the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor.\r\nThailand also welcomes the recent release of the\r\nreport of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations, headed by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. We look\r\nforward to the implementation of many of the practical\r\nrecommendations proposed by the Panel with a view to\r\nstrengthening the capacity of the United Nations to\r\nconduct efficient peacekeeping operations and mount a\r\nquick response to potential threats to international\r\nsecurity.\r\nAs the primary organ responsible for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and stability, the Security Council\r\n34\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nmust also be reformed to enable it to carry out its tasks\r\nmore effectively. In line with the increased membership\r\nof, and mounting challenges to, this world\r\nOrganization over the decades, Thailand supports the\r\nexpansion of Security Council membership in both\r\npermanent and non-permanent seats, based on the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation,\r\nefficiency and readiness to share the responsibilities.\r\nIn closing, I would like to reiterate Thailands\r\nsupport for the Secretary-Generals millennium report\r\nand our pledge to work with the international\r\ncommunity in realizing the practical recommendations\r\ncontained in it. It is our earnest hope that the outcome\r\nof the deliberations at this historic Millennium Summit\r\nwill help chart a new course for closer partnership\r\namong all nations, international organizations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, civil society, parliaments\r\nand private corporations in the quest for a better and\r\nbrighter future for all of us and for posterity.\r\nThe Co-Chairperson (Finland): The Assembly\r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdurrahman Shalghem, Secretary of the General\r\nPeoples Committee for Foreign Liaison and\r\nInternational Cooperation of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya.\r\nMr. Shalghem (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): As we meet at this\r\nhistoric Summit in an attempt to formulate an\r\nappropriate vision for the future of humanity in the\r\nnext millennium, we express the hope that the past\r\ncentury  with all of its scientific achievement and\r\nprogress in all fields, as well as the negative impact it\r\nhas had on peoples and on the environment  will\r\nprovide us with guidelines to shape our aspirations and\r\nour dreams of a world that is free from oppression,\r\nexploitation, the destruction of the planet and nature,\r\nthe marginalization of millions of people and disrespect\r\nfor human rights.\r\nWe believe that the foundation of the world of the\r\nnew millennium must be the achievement of equality\r\nfor all human beings, the prevention of all forms of\r\ndiscrimination and the consecration of the human being\r\nas the most valuable and precious creature on earth. On\r\nthis basis, greater attention must be accorded to\r\nchildrens health and education. Children must be\r\nprovided with circumstances that allow them to grow\r\nup to be healthy, creative, free and strong human\r\nbeings. This desirable state of affairs will require laws\r\nthat safeguard the rights of mothers and their children\r\nand the right of every human being to his or her own\r\nhome and to be a partner in shaping his or her own life.\r\nIn order to prevent the return of colonialism, the\r\ncolonizing States should compensate the peoples they\r\ncolonized for the persecution inflicted on them, the\r\ndestruction caused to their environment and the\r\nplundering of their resources and cultural properties.\r\nThe objective behind the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is the punishment of the\r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes against\r\nhumanity and against international security. However,\r\nthe Rome Statute is designed to try only the weak.\r\nSuch a Statute cannot be accepted, and neither can it be\r\nsigned or ratified unless it is modified in a manner that\r\nguarantees that justice is meted out to all those who\r\nperpetrate acts of aggression, drug smugglers and their\r\ntrade partners, those responsible for mass killings of\r\ninnocent people, and those who commit aggression\r\nagainst international forces.\r\nThe Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction deals only\r\nwith simple weapons of limited effect. As a third-world\r\npeople, unable to defend our borders and our lands\r\nagainst powerful nations that possess aircraft carriers\r\nand aircraft that refuel during flights, we believe that\r\nhumanity should be more preoccupied with the\r\ndestruction of nuclear, chemical, biological and\r\nballistic weapons rather than with mines, which are a\r\nsimple type of weapon.\r\nTerrorism has taken on many forms.\r\nInternationally imposed sanctions and external debt are\r\nforms of terrorism. The use and the threat of use of\r\nnuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction all\r\nconstitute forms of terrorism, as do the conditions\r\nimposed by the World Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.\r\nTherefore, in order for the international community to\r\ncombat terrorism, we should first and foremost define\r\nit and its causes as well as all acts of violence.\r\nIn this respect, it is imperative that the following\r\nprinciples be upheld.\r\nFirst, a distinction must be made between the\r\nvarious forms of terrorism and peoples struggle for\r\nfreedom, as well as the struggle waged by persecuted\r\n35\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\ngroups against their oppressors, which is seen by some\r\nas terrorism.\r\nSecondly, all States must undertake to accept the\r\nrepatriation of all persons living in exile and all\r\nrefugees and to guarantee their safety and assist them\r\nin resettling.\r\nThirdly, compensation must be provided for\r\npeoples, as well as individuals and their families, that\r\nfall victim to terrorism and violence.\r\nFourthly, all abducted persons and detainees must\r\nbe released, and all persons being sought by the\r\ninternational police must be surrendered.\r\nMr. Tuomioja (Finland) took the Chair.\r\nWithout agreement on all such issues, it is certain\r\nthat the signing or ratification of any international\r\nconvention or agreement on international terrorism will\r\nbe to no avail.\r\nThe creation of a world in which prosperity\r\nprevails requires commitment to the implementation of\r\ninternational agreements on maternal and child care\r\nand protection. And a world free from aggression and\r\nhostilities requires the prohibition of all manifestations\r\nof violence. Furthermore, in order to achieve a world\r\nfree from epidemics and disease, we need to fight\r\nvigorously against dangerous diseases such as cancer,\r\nAIDS, poliomyelitis and malaria. There must also be an\r\neffort to combat the use of white poisons  cocaine\r\nand heroin  and the treatment of addicts. Moreover,\r\nin order to protect our planet from the dangers that\r\nthreaten it, we should work to stop desertification and\r\nto eradicate crop pests. We should also strive to\r\nestablish low-cost water desalination systems. Here, we\r\npropose the creation of a United Nations fund to which\r\nall countries would contribute.\r\nMeeting Africas special needs means refraining\r\nfrom exploiting its resources, plundering its riches and\r\nsquandering its wealth. It also requires non-\r\ninterference in its internal affairs, and ceasing to\r\nimpose on the African continent concepts that are alien\r\nto its culture and traditions. Furthermore, States which\r\ncolonized Africa and enslaved its peoples must\r\napologize to the continent and pay full compensation\r\nfor the damages inflicted by colonialism.\r\nWe feel that the United Nations cannot play an\r\neffective role in meeting the challenges posed by\r\ninternational problems unless it undergoes a radical\r\nreform compatible with its Charter. For this reason, the\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly must be binding.\r\nThe Assembly must also exercise control over all other\r\nUnited Nations organs, including the Security Council,\r\nwhich must be accountable to the Assembly. The\r\nCouncil should act as an executive tool for the\r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions. The\r\nAssembly should approve the resolutions adopted by\r\nthe Security Council. The right of veto should also be\r\nsubject to review in a manner that leads either to its\r\nabolition or to its possession by the general\r\nmembership of the Council.\r\nThe United Nations should establish\r\nsubcommittees covering most parts of the world and\r\nresponsible for the inspection, implementation and\r\nfollow-up of United Nations programmes.\r\nThat is our vision of how the world should look\r\nin the third millennium. We need a world in which\r\npeace and security have been achieved, in which\r\nstability and prosperity have been enhanced, in which\r\ndisease, ignorance and poverty have been eradicated,\r\nand, first and foremost, in which the will of all peoples\r\nis respected.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Muratbek Imanaliev, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMr. Imanaliev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nWe had been looking forward to the opening of the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly: the\r\nMillennium Assembly. It was expected that the\r\ndiscussions would be about the future of mankind \r\nand todays discussions are indeed about the future,\r\nwhich depends on us. It is highly desirable that long-\r\nterm positive results and favourable consequences for\r\nall peoples should flow from the ideas and\r\nrecommendations of this global forum.\r\nThe people of Kyrgyzstan are impressed by the\r\nconcepts and the concrete proposals set out by the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, in\r\nhis report entitled We, the peoples: the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century\r\n(A/54/2000). We also agree with his point that the\r\nMillennium Summit gives world leaders an\r\nunprecedented opportunity to rebuild the United\r\nNations in keeping with the tasks of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\n36\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nThe United Nations has always been a unique\r\nglobal forum. In keeping with its universal character\r\nand with historic agreements, it needs to broaden its\r\nmandate to solve vital issues of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the promotion and\r\nstimulation of development and the mobilization of the\r\nefforts that the international community must carry out\r\nto combat future challenges and threats.\r\nThe globalization process has both positive and\r\nnegative features. With any new system, anxieties are\r\nbound to arise, particularly among those who feel\r\noppressed by the process, and especially if we commit\r\nerrors and permit misunderstandings to occur. The\r\nmain role in preventing that anxiety should lie with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThose are some of the reasons why the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic favours increasing the overall effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations, which should be a results-oriented\r\norganization. We envision a United Nations with better\r\nmanagement and a well ordered structure, an\r\norganization better prepared to cope with humanitarian\r\nand political crises. We also understand the need for\r\noverall, effective reform of the United Nations,\r\nincluding the expansion of the Security Council in both\r\nits categories, and we support such reform. Reform\r\nshould be solidly grounded in respect for all United\r\nNations bodies that have already proven their\r\nendurance.\r\nThe aim of Kyrgyzstans participation in world\r\naffairs is safe and friendly coexistence with all\r\ncountries. This proceeds from the idea of the\r\ninterdependence of the world, and mutually beneficial\r\nactivities, on an equal footing, on the part of all\r\ncountries and peoples. That is the basis for President\r\nAskar Arkaevs concept of Silk Road diplomacy.\r\nRestoring the Silk Road is the central idea of a wide\r\nrange of active historical processes based on a\r\nuniversal and creative dynamic that is founded on the\r\nneeds of mankind. The realization of that concept will\r\nbe impossible without the strengthening of friendly,\r\ntrusting, fruitful relationships among all States, not\r\nonly those along the great Silk Road. This concept can\r\nbe realized only on the basis of universal access to all\r\nthe achievements of human civilization. Our vision of\r\nthe restoration of the Silk Road involves a new culture\r\nof peace and a new culture of human existence in a\r\nclean environment free from suffering, hunger, poverty\r\nand illiteracy.\r\nAs it crosses the threshold of the third\r\nmillennium, Kyrgyzstan, like other Central Asian\r\nStates, has been facing various threats, such as\r\ninternational terrorism and religious extremism.\r\nTerrorism is most often accompanied by illegal\r\ntrafficking in weapons and in drugs. These factors pose\r\na genuine, grave threat to stability and security  and\r\nnot only in our region. We in Kyrgyzstan are convinced\r\nthat no individual country can cope on its own with\r\nthese evils. Collective measures are necessary to\r\novercome these problems. Terrorism has ceased to be\r\nthe problem of any one State but rather represents a\r\nthreat to the entire world community.\r\nThat is why the efforts of our countries should be\r\nsupported by the international community, as the\r\nleaders of Central Asian countries have repeatedly\r\ndeclared. And the role of the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council in this process is especially\r\nimportant. First and foremost, my country will actively\r\nsupport the creation of an international system of\r\nmeasures for controlling terrorism and other forms of\r\nextremism.\r\nI would like to highlight the situation in\r\nAfghanistan. The people of that country continue to\r\nbear many burdens, and to be the victims of violence\r\nand death. Moreover, that country has become a source\r\nof terrorism, drug trafficking and myriad other\r\nproblems. Kyrgyzstan supports efforts undertaken by\r\nthe United Nations, and also welcomes other useful\r\ninitiatives. We express the hope that effective measures\r\nwill be undertaken radically to improve conditions in\r\nAfghanistan. For our part, we sincerely wish to\r\npromote the prompt establishment of peace in\r\nAfghanistan and stability in the region as a whole.\r\nAccordingly, the Kyrgyz Republic reaffirms its\r\nreadiness to host a peace conference on Afghanistan\r\nunder United Nations auspices.\r\nWe all agree that dialogue and a desire to solve\r\njointly all our common issues is far better than conflict\r\nand war. That is an absolute truth. During the summit\r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) held at Istanbul in November 1999, the\r\nPresident of Kyrgyzstan put forward the idea of\r\norganizing a forum-dialogue between the OSCE and\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference on matters\r\nof security, peace and sustainable development.\r\nKyrgyzstan considers that such a forum-dialogue could\r\npromote the development of mechanisms for jointly\r\nconfronting the threats and challenges that the States of\r\n37\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nan extensive region now face. The forum-dialogue\r\nwould strengthen mutual understanding and respect\r\namong peoples, and would continue the fruitful\r\ndialogue among civilizations.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic believes that the\r\nMillennium Summit represents a unique opportunity\r\nnot only to discuss the problems facing us but also to\r\nadopt the correct programme of action. That is how we\r\nview the draft Millennium Declaration of the Summit.\r\nOne can only understand a journey by embarking on it.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Lakshman Kadirgamar, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Special Envoy of the President of\r\nSri Lanka.\r\nMr. Kadirgamar: I have the honour to deliver,\r\non behalf of the President of Sri Lanka, Her Excellency\r\nChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the following\r\nmessage to the Millennium Summit:\r\nForty four years ago, when the United\r\nNations was still young and full of hope, a former\r\nPrime Minister of Sri Lanka, my late father,\r\nS.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, addressing the General\r\nAssembly from this very podium said\r\nthe prevention of war is a necessary\r\nfactor for peace, but peace is\r\nsomething much more positive than\r\nthat. In its true sense it means human\r\nunderstanding, human friendship and\r\ncooperation out of which, indeed,\r\npeace in its true form alone can rise.\r\nThe United Nations is the one machine\r\navailable to mankind today through\r\nwhich it can express this\r\nunconquerable spirit of man in his\r\nefforts to achieve that peace,\r\nfriendship and collaboration.\r\nAs the new millennium opens I ask\r\nmyself  is the world a better place to live in\r\ntoday than it was 40 years ago? In some ways\r\nyes, in other ways no. Stark contrasts still\r\nabound. The unconquerable spirit of man remains\r\nundimmed. He has dived to the bottom of the\r\noceans; he and his machines have soared to the\r\nhighest heavens. Medical and surgical miracles\r\nhave prolonged his life. Technological marvels in\r\nthe fields of information and communication\r\ncontinue to dazzle us. But while undreamed of\r\nwealth and affluence have been generated in some\r\nquarters of the globe, in others mankind has\r\nplunged deeper into the abyss of poverty, hunger,\r\ndisease and squalor. These problems remain to be\r\naddressed  and addressed urgently. We have\r\nbeen spared the horrors of another global war \r\nan achievement for which the United Nations\r\ndeserves great credit  but there is turmoil all\r\naround us. New threats have arisen to the stability\r\nand security of States. That is the problem I wish\r\nto address today.\r\nPeace among all States and peace among\r\nall peoples within States so that all, and not only\r\nsome, may in safety, without fear, in dignity,\r\nwithout humiliation, in good health, and in\r\nmaterial and spiritual well-being enjoy the\r\nwonders of life on this miracle we call the planet\r\nEarth  such is my dream, such is my hope for\r\nthe future at this Millennium Summit.\r\nHowever, how do we all  all States and\r\nall peoples within States  go from dream to\r\nreality? Of the problems that could then arise \r\nthe problems of limited resources, competing\r\npriorities, cost-effective procedures, catastrophic\r\ndisruptions  I shall not speak today. But I\r\nwould like to speak today on the fundamentals of\r\nthe United Nations structure  the fundamentals\r\nthat we must protect and preserve for the future.\r\nIt is here in the General Assembly that\r\nrepresentatives of Governments, of peoples, of\r\nStates gather in solemn assembly, governed by a\r\nCharter that assures States of their sovereign\r\nequality, their political independence, their\r\nterritorial integrity. States, peoples, Governments,\r\nrepresentatives, the Charter of the United\r\nNations  these are the fundamentals of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThis Organization, essential and pragmatic\r\nbut still very fragile, reflects those fundamentals\r\nin its origins and composition, in its structure and\r\ncapacities, and in its limitations. And always at\r\nthe core, we find the entity we know as the State.\r\nThat is as it should be. States are the principal\r\norganizational entities into which the peoples of\r\nthis planet have gathered, and the inter-States\r\nsystem is the principal organizational edifice of\r\nthe international community. If States weaken, so\r\n38\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nwill this Organization. If States are diminished,\r\nso will this Organization be diminished; for the\r\nentity we know as the State, there is no substitute.\r\nLet us remember that States are corporate\r\nentities of enormous complexity, differing\r\nentirely from the corporate entities of the private\r\nsector that are usually of single or limited\r\npurpose, and often authoritarian in management\r\nstyles. If the management of a developed State\r\nwith more than adequate resources can be a\r\ncomplex undertaking, how much more complex\r\nwould be the management of a multi-ethnic,\r\nmulti-religious, post-colonial, developing State,\r\nwhere the legacies of centuries of a colonial past\r\ntake more than one generation to erase?\r\nWhere there is the use of armed force\r\nagainst a State, as in my country, the complexities\r\nwithin a State compound themselves many times\r\nover. My country, Sri Lanka, has had for many\r\nyears an armed conflict within its territory that\r\nhas complicated the lives of the entire population\r\nof the country. It is a conflict of an extraordinary\r\nnature. A very small group, schooled in and\r\ntotally devoted to violence, standing outside the\r\nprocesses of peaceful society and participatory\r\ngovernance, achieving through the practice of\r\nsystematic terror a national and international\r\nnotoriety, rejecting all overtures for settlement of\r\ndifferences through dialogue, sustained by\r\nmassive funding and other support from\r\nexpatriates settled in countries of goodwill and\r\nopen heart, continues to battle the State.\r\nThis phenomenon is not indigenous to Sri\r\nLanka alone. The Secretary-General in his report\r\nto the General Assembly in 1997 that contained\r\nhis proposals for United Nations reform referred\r\nto the powerful threats to government authority\r\nand civil society from networks of crime,\r\nnarcotics, money-laundering and terrorism.\r\nWhen the security and integrity of one\r\nState is threatened by an armed group within it, it\r\nsurely behoves all other States to deny that armed\r\ngroup any encouragement, succour or safe haven.\r\nThat is my plea today on behalf of Sri Lanka.\r\nA democratic State  because of its\r\nopenness, its laws, traditions and practices, its\r\ncommitment to tolerance and dissent  is\r\nespecially vulnerable to the deployment of force\r\nagainst it by any group within its boundaries. An\r\ninternal armed challenge to any State anywhere is\r\na challenge to all States everywhere. Unless all\r\nStates, and democratic States in particular, agree\r\nto come to the aid of a State thus in peril,\r\ndemocracy itself will be imperilled everywhere.\r\nDemocracy will not survive.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Séverin Ntahomvukiye, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Burundi.\r\nMr. Ntahomvukiye (Burundi) (spoke in French):\r\nIt is a privilege for me to take the floor at this solemn\r\nMillennium Summit, on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Burundi and the delegation\r\naccompanying me, and on my own behalf.\r\nSince our allotted time is short, I wish to limit\r\nmyself to informing the General Assembly on the\r\ndevelopment of the situation in my country, which, as\r\nis known, has been experiencing the horrors of civil\r\nwar for seven years. Consideration of the other\r\ninternational issues is developed in the text of my\r\nstatement, which will be distributed.\r\nTwo years ago, from this same rostrum, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, Mr. Pierre\r\nBuyoya, spoke on the comprehensive and inclusive\r\npeace process that had just been launched. Everyone,\r\ninside and outside the country, was skeptical about the\r\npositive outcome of this difficult enterprise.\r\nWhere are we today? The Burundian people are\r\nin the process of turning a page in their history. The\r\nagreement on peace and national reconciliation was\r\nsigned on 28 August in Arusha, Tanzania, before the\r\neyes of the entire world, which hailed the occasion.\r\nThat was a qualitative leap forward towards a better\r\nfuture for the Burundian people.\r\nThe Government pays a tribute to the tireless\r\nefforts of the Burundian negotiators of all leanings. It\r\nurges them to permanently bury the hatchet of war, to\r\nconsolidate the gains of national unity and to lead the\r\npeople on the path of development.\r\nThe Government of Burundi also expresses its\r\ngreat appreciation to the entire international\r\ncommunity, and to the countries of the region in\r\nparticular, for the assistance, advice and facilitation\r\nprovided throughout this long and painful struggle for\r\npeace.\r\n39\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nA special tribute goes to Mwalimu Julius\r\nNyerere, the engineer and catalyst of the peace process\r\nat its outset, as well as to Nobel Peace Prize winner\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela, whose skill, matchless\r\nmediation and unequalled determination succeeded in\r\nwearing down mistrust. He succeeded, and in fact it is\r\nthe people of Burundi as a whole who won.\r\nEverything has not yet been resolved. Major\r\nchallenges remain to be met. Aside from some\r\nreservations expressed by certain parties, which have\r\nbegun to be addressed, the greatest remaining\r\nchallenge is ending the war, without which the\r\nimplementation of the agreement is practically\r\nimpossible. The meeting between the Government\r\narmy and the armed groups, to be held on 20\r\nSeptember at Nairobi, Kenya, will be critical in this\r\nregard. Subsequently, the firm commitment of all\r\nparties will be necessary to implement the accord\r\nstrictly in the nations general interest.\r\nBurundi is drained, destroyed and ruined after\r\nseven years of war, three years of embargo and the\r\nfreezing of international assistance. The unavoidable\r\nprerequisite for renewing cooperation has always been\r\nthe signature of the peace accord. This has been done.\r\nWe launch a heartfelt appeal to all bilateral and\r\nmultilateral partners to renew unreservedly their\r\nsolidarity with Burundi.\r\nIt is our hope to attain a fair and sustainable\r\npeace. In that way, Burundi will be able to make its\r\nmodest contribution to the realization of this\r\nOrganizations primary objective: the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nI will end here. As I stated earlier, the rest of my\r\nstatement addresses Burundis view on the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century, particularly\r\nin connection with changing the Security Council\r\nthrough the equitable representation of all regions of\r\nthe planet. It also addresses the struggle against\r\npoverty and international peace and security.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. João Bernardo de Miranda, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Angola.\r\nMr. Miranda (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): This Summit\r\nprovides us with an opportunity to address in-depth\r\nissues that are critical for the development and the\r\nwell-being of all peoples of the world. Poverty and\r\nproblems associated with it, such as unemployment,\r\nunderemployment and lack of access to basic\r\neducation, health and clean water, continue to increase\r\nin many countries.\r\nArmed conflicts and local wars caused by social\r\nand political factors persist and endanger the lives of\r\nmillions of people, widening the gap between rich and\r\npoor countries. They are among the main barriers to\r\ndevelopment. Over the last few years, economic,\r\nscientific and technological advances, unprecedented in\r\nthe history of mankind, have been made. But they have\r\nbenefited only a fifth of the worlds population. This\r\nsmall percentage controls 86 per cent of the worlds\r\nproduction, 82 per cent of export markets, 68 per cent\r\nof foreign direct investment and 74 per cent of all\r\ntelephone lines on the planet.\r\nFar from reducing poverty, initiatives in\r\ndeveloping countries to counter this income\r\nconcentration trend through structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes have ended up increasing inequalities\r\nbecause they promote only growth and not human\r\ndevelopment. This is happening primarily in African\r\ncountries, where almost half the population survives on\r\nless than $2 a day.\r\nAlthough globalization has had a major impact on\r\ninternational relations, affecting all areas of human life,\r\nand especially the development process in poor\r\ncountries, these nations still lack the capacity to face\r\nthe challenges engendered by this process and are\r\nunable to take advantage of the opportunities being\r\ncreated or to minimize its unfavourable aspects.\r\nIn fact, what we are witnessing is the imposition\r\nof equal rules for countries at different stages of\r\ndevelopment, thus limiting competitiveness for the\r\nweak. To benefit all, a new, fair and more sustainable\r\neconomic order is necessary, as well as a change in the\r\npresent international financial order to make it capable\r\nof reducing the gap between rich and poor.\r\nIn this process of increasing inequality, we also\r\nneed to take into account the external debt. Far-\r\nreaching programmes intended to solve economic\r\nproblems in developing countries have only increased\r\npoverty, misery and marginalization, further deepening\r\nthe vicious cycle of debt, poverty and under-\r\ndevelopment.\r\n40\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nIn a global context, Africa is the poorest of all\r\ncontinents. It should, therefore, receive global\r\nassistance, including debt re-scheduling, and even debt\r\nrelief or forgiveness. Africas development should be\r\nfinanced by a global assistance fund that would link\r\neconomic reform to poverty eradication.\r\nMany previous speakers have stressed the need to\r\nreform our Organization so that it can meet the present\r\nchallenges of todays world. Angola fully concurs.\r\nEspecially important are current proposals for greater\r\ndemocratization and strengthening of the United\r\nNations so that it can achieve its unique mission of\r\npromoting a more dignified, prosperous and peaceful\r\nworld, preserving and reinforcing the legitimate\r\ninterests of all.\r\nAngola reiterates its firm support for the African\r\ncommon position on equitable representation in and\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council, designed to\r\nsecure two permanent and two non-permanent seats for\r\nAfrica on an enlarged Security Council.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm Angolas\r\ndetermination to contribute to a more secure and\r\nprosperous world for all in this third millennium.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): The\r\nAssembly will next hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Sélim Tadmoury, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nLebanon.\r\nMr. Tadmoury (Lebanon): Lebanon is\r\nparticularly proud to participate in this historically\r\nsignificant Summit, especially after the recent\r\nliberation of its southern part, thanks to the\r\nsteadfastness and the resistance of the Lebanese people\r\nand to the support of the international community. The\r\nIsraeli occupation, which lasted for more than 22 years,\r\nwitnessed the loss of thousands of innocent civilian\r\nlives and inflicted extensive damage on the countrys\r\nmost vital infrastructures. Insidiously, it paralyzed\r\nLebanons economy on the whole, impeded its socio-\r\neconomic development and inhibited its historic\r\ncontribution to human civilization, a contribution\r\nwhich Lebanon had been extending for 5,000 years.\r\nLebanon considers the liberation of its territory\r\nfrom the Israeli occupation an incomplete step. It must\r\nbe followed by a solution to the question of the\r\nPalestinian refugees, particularly those whom Lebanon\r\nhas been hosting on its soil for more than 50 years. Our\r\nultimate objective is to reach a just, comprehensive and\r\nlasting peace, based on the Israeli withdrawal from the\r\nGolan Heights up to the line of 4 June 1967, according\r\nto resolutions of international legitimacy and to the\r\nterms of reference of the 1991 Madrid Conference.\r\nLebanon also calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to enable the Palestinian people to exercise\r\ntheir inalienable rights and, above all, the right to self-\r\ndetermination and to establish their independent State\r\nof Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nWhile we gather today to reaffirm our belief in\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter, Lebanon confirms the objective correlation\r\nbetween the establishment of international peace and\r\nsecurity and the development process and peace-\r\nbuilding as well. It is so obvious that armed conflicts\r\nhave prevented and continue to prevent countries and\r\npeople from involving their human and economic\r\nresources in the process of development and peace-\r\nbuilding. Enhancing the United Nations mechanisms of\r\npeacemaking and promoting proper conditions for\r\nsustainable development require the reform of the most\r\nimportant bodies of our Organization  namely, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nBy doing so, the United Nations system can contribute\r\nto the improvement of the living conditions in\r\ndeveloping countries. The reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, extensively debated among Member States,\r\nshould be based on transparency, rationalization of\r\nworking methods and equitable representation in light\r\nof the political, demographic and economic\r\ndevelopment that has occurred since the end of the\r\nSecond World War, although, in order to achieve this\r\ngoal, the international community is invited to adopt a\r\ncourageous action in this direction.\r\nWe equally view the necessity to reform the\r\nEconomic and Social Council by re-evaluating and\r\nrevising its role and its mandate in a manner that both\r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil could function in a harmonious system\r\nresponding effectively to the needs of our century. No\r\none today can separate our right to enjoy peace and\r\nsecurity from our right to achieve development.\r\nThe long march of the United Nations has,\r\nparticularly during the last two decades, witnessed\r\nvaluable achievements in the human rights arena. A\r\nsignificant number of international treaties, mostly\r\nrelating to the protection of women, children, refugees,\r\nand conventions relating to peace and war, have been\r\n41\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nadopted. In addition to those treaties, a number of\r\nUnited Nations bodies have been created to fulfil the\r\ntreaties objectives. This current Millennium Summit\r\nshould uphold the unprecedented international and\r\nuniversal achievements which will be conducive to a\r\nnew global human order.\r\nHowever, in spite of the progress accomplished in\r\nthe human rights domain, Arab territories remain under\r\nIsraeli occupation, their inhabitants suffering\r\ncontinuously under the deliberate and violent\r\ninfringements of the occupying forces. We remind the\r\ninternational community of the long ordeal of Lebanese\r\ncitizens, who have been detained for years in Israeli\r\nmanned jails as hostages, denied due process of law, in\r\ndefiance of the principles of international laws and\r\nconventions, particularly the Fourth Geneva\r\nConvention of 1949. We call for their immediate\r\nrelease.\r\nLebanon strongly hopes that the final declaration\r\nto be issued pursuant to our Summit will be a renewed\r\nact of faith in the Charter of the United Nations, that its\r\ncontents will accurately reflect fair, peaceful and\r\nconstructive solutions to the uncertainties and\r\npredicaments of the people of all nations, and that its\r\nheadlines will bear witness to the Secretary-Generals\r\nceaseless endeavour for peace and to his tireless efforts\r\nto re-direct the United Nations to a position of high\r\ncompatibility with the aspirations of future generations.\r\nThe Acting Co-Chairperson (Finland): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Michel Kafando, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nBurkina Faso.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nIt is a signal honour for me to address this Millennium\r\nSummit on behalf of President Blaise Compaore, who\r\nvery much wished to participate in this. Unfortunately,\r\npressing engagements have prevented him from doing\r\nso.\r\nThe occasion which brings us together today is\r\nunprecedented and provides us all with special\r\nopportunity to ask about the future of humankind at the\r\ndawn of the third millennium.\r\nThe past century saw the birth of the United\r\nNations which set itself the goal of saving us from the\r\nscourge of war and of forging between people and\r\nnations links of solidarity, friendship and cooperation\r\nof a new kind. Despite this political will, strongly\r\nexpressed at San Fransisco, the United Nations did not\r\nsucceed in saving the world from the cold war and the\r\nunbridled arms race.\r\nWe, the small nations, in bodies such as the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, have ceaselessly drawn attention\r\nto the dangerous and harmful consequences of this\r\nbalance of terror. Our leitmotif has always been to\r\nreverse this trend and to devote the vast resources\r\nwhich it swallowed up to activities of developing the\r\npoor countries.\r\nWe are obliged to note that these repeated appeals\r\nhave not been heard and that the gap between poor and\r\nrich countries is today wider than ever.\r\nThe phenomenon of globalization seems already\r\nto have relegated to oblivion what we have\r\nexperienced. For us, the developing countries, the same\r\nquestions, the same concerns remain. Our peoples\r\nwonder what globalization can bring them that is more\r\nor better. They wonder what impact it can have on their\r\ndaily concerns and their quest for well-being.\r\nThus, for us, it is not a question of coming here to\r\nfollow a ritual, but rather to share our vision of the best\r\nway of managing globalization in the clear interest of\r\npeoples and nations.\r\nIt is a fact that whilst the end of the cold war rang\r\nthe death knell on East/West antagonism, it in no way\r\nreduced the imbalance between rich and poor countries.\r\nThus we should ask what today is the level of\r\ncommitment of willingness and the political will of the\r\nrich countries, who hold the capital and the technology,\r\nto carry out specific actions so as to avoid globalization\r\nbecoming yet another occasion to marginalize the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe are convinced that globalization must go hand\r\nin hand with a greater democratization of international\r\nrelations and with a profound reform of the decision-\r\nmaking procedures within the organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations system, first of all, at the level of the\r\nSecurity Council. By thus giving all nations, small and\r\nlarge, the opportunity to make their contribution to\r\nbuilding a more just and fairer world, we will increase\r\nour chances of reducing frustrations, sources of\r\ntensions and conflicts and we will then better serve the\r\ncause of peace, since that is the mission given to our\r\nOrganization.\r\n42\r\nA/55/PV.7\r\nFor all of these reasons, Burkina Faso appeals to\r\nthe conscience of humankind so that the Republic of\r\nChina quickly regain its place within the United\r\nNations so as to guarantee the fundamental right of its\r\ntwenty-three million inhabitants to participate in the\r\nmanagement of the activities of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn conclusion, we welcome the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the role of the United Nations in\r\nthe twenty-first century which advocates major actions\r\nto be taken in order to equip ourselves better to cope\r\nwith the major challenges and the concerns of our\r\npeoples.\r\nThese ideas are taken up in the draft declaration\r\nof the Millennium which will be submitted for our\r\nadoption at the end of our work.\r\nOur hope is that the Summit will develop, based\r\non this declaration, a plan of action and will create a\r\nfollow-up mechanism to ensure its effective and\r\ndiligent implementation.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2 p.m.\r\n"
