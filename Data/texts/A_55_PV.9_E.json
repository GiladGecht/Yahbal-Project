(Finland)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nThe President: Twice already, I have urged\r\ndelegations to be in the General Assembly Hall on\r\ntime, and I do so once more.\r\nBut owing to the absence of a quorum, I am\r\nobliged now to suspend the meeting.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.20 a.m. and resumed\r\nat 11.20 a.m.\r\nItem 8 of the provisional agenda\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nfirst report of the General Committee (A/55/250)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now consider\r\nthe first report of the General Committee, which has\r\nbeen circulated in document A/55/250. I shall refer to\r\nspecific sections and paragraphs of the report which\r\ncontain recommendations for consideration by the\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn paragraph 2 of its report, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to the provisions reproduced in annexes V,\r\nVI, VII and VIII to the Assembly’s rules of procedure.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nthose provisions?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 3 of its report, the\r\nGeneral Committee took note of annex I — entitled\r\n“Guidelines on the rationalization of the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly” — to General Assembly resolution\r\n48/264 of 29 July 1994, entitled “Revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly”; of the annex to\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/241 of 31 July 1997,\r\nentitled “Strengthening of the United Nations system”;\r\nand of paragraph 1 of resolution 52/163 of\r\n15 December 1997, entitled “Amendment to rule 103\r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly”.\r\nThe provisions of the resolutions are reflected in the\r\ndocument before the General Assembly under the\r\nrelevant sections.\r\nIn paragraph 4 of its report, the General\r\nCommittee took note of the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the implementation of General Assembly\r\nresolutions 48/264 (A/52/856) and 51/241 (A/52/855).\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nparagraph 4 of the report?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We shall now examine section II\r\nof the report, which deals with the organization of the\r\nsession.\r\nWe turn first to section II.B, which deals with the\r\nrationalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nIn paragraph 7 of its report, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution\r\n45/45, recommending that certain Main Committees\r\nshould meet in sequential order.\r\n2\r\nA/55/PV.9\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of paragraph 7 of the report?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 8, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the Assembly to\r\nparagraphs 30, 31 and 36 of the annex to resolution\r\n51/241, providing that the Main Committees should\r\nhold organizational meetings before the\r\ncommencement of the general debate and should meet\r\nin substantive session only after the end of the general\r\ndebate; and that the First and Fourth Committees\r\nshould meet, to the extent feasible, in a sequential\r\nmanner.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nparagraph 8?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 9, the General\r\nCommittee took note of paragraph 1 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 52/163, which amends the first\r\nsentence of rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to read as follows:\r\n“Each Main Committee shall elect a\r\nChairman, three Vice-Chairmen and a\r\nRapporteur”.\r\nIn paragraph 10, the General Committee took\r\nnote of the fact that measures introduced to reduce\r\ncosts relating to overtime would be strictly enforced.\r\nWe now turn to section II.C, on the closing date\r\nof the fifty-fifth session.\r\nIn paragraph 11, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the Assembly that the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the General Assembly should recess no later than\r\nTuesday, 5 December 2000.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 12, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the General Assembly to\r\nthe fact that the closing date of the fifth-fifth session\r\nwill be subject to a decision of the Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nparagraph 12?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 13, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the Assembly that the First\r\nCommittee should complete its work by Friday,\r\n3 November; the Special Political and Decolonization\r\n(Fourth) Committee by Thursday, 9 November; the\r\nThird Committee by Friday, 10 November; the Sixth\r\nCommittee by Tuesday, 21 November; and the Second\r\nand Fifth Committees by Friday, 1 December 2000.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves the\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Next, we turn to section II.D,\r\nconcerning the schedule of meetings.\r\nIn paragraph 14, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the General Assembly that morning\r\nmeetings should start at 10 a.m. promptly for all\r\nplenary meetings and meetings of the Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to remind members\r\nthat, for the afternoon meetings, I intend to begin\r\npromptly at 3 p.m.\r\nIn the same paragraph, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the Assembly that, as a cost-saving\r\nmeasure, plenary meetings and meetings of the Main\r\nCommittees, including informals, be adjourned by 6\r\np.m. and that no meetings be held on weekends, with\r\nthe exception of the general debate. The Committee\r\nfurther recommends that this cost-saving measure\r\nshould also apply, for the remainder of 2000, to\r\nmeetings on the calendar of conferences and meetings\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 15, the General\r\nCommittee recommends that, in order to avoid the late\r\nstart of meetings, the General Assembly should waive\r\nthe requirement of the presence of at least one third of\r\nthe members to declare a plenary meeting open and\r\npermit the debate to proceed, and of at least one quarter\r\nof the members to declare a meeting of a Main\r\nCommittee open and permit the debate to proceed.\r\n3\r\nA/55/PV.9\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In that connection, I should like\r\nto endorse strongly the practical suggestion made at\r\nprevious sessions, for each delegation to designate\r\nsomeone to be present at the scheduled time. I\r\ngenuinely hope that all delegations will cooperate.\r\nIn paragraph 16, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the General Assembly that delegations\r\nshould be reminded of the utmost importance of\r\npunctuality.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In that regard, I should like to\r\nimpress upon members that a 10-minute delay of the\r\nstart of every meeting at Headquarters would result in a\r\nwaste of approximately $800,000 a year. I therefore\r\nsincerely hope that all delegations will make a special\r\neffort to cooperate in this regard, so that all meetings\r\ncan start promptly at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.\r\nIn section II.E, concerning the general debate, the\r\nGeneral Committee took note of the fact that the\r\ngeneral debate would be held from Tuesday, 12\r\nSeptember, to Saturday, 16 September 2000, and from\r\nMonday, 18 September, to Friday, 22 September 2000.\r\nIn paragraph 18, the Committee draws the\r\nattention of the Assembly to paragraph 21 of the annex\r\nto resolution 51/241, where the Assembly indicated a\r\nvoluntary guideline of up to 20 minutes for each\r\nstatement in the general debate.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nparagraph 18?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In that regard, I should like to\r\nremind delegations of the request by the Secretariat\r\nthat speakers deliver their statements at a normal speed\r\nwithin the given time-frame at all times to allow for\r\nproper interpretation.\r\nIn paragraph 19, the General Committee endorsed\r\nthe suggestion of the Secretary-General that the list of\r\nspeakers in the general debate be closed on Thursday,\r\n14 September, at 6 p.m.\r\nIn view of the very large number of speakers\r\nalready inscribed on the list, I urge representatives to\r\ntake the floor in the order in which they appear on the\r\nlist of speakers in the general debate. Those who are\r\nunable to speak at the scheduled time will be put at the\r\nend of the list for that meeting.\r\nIn paragraph 20, the General Committee draws\r\nthe Assembly’s attention to a previous decision of the\r\nAssembly to strongly discourage the practice of\r\nexpressing congratulations inside the General\r\nAssembly Hall after a speech has been delivered. The\r\nCommittee recommends that this provision should also\r\napply during the fifty-fifth session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee also\r\nrecommends to the Assembly that, after delivering\r\ntheir statements, speakers in the general debate should\r\nleave the General Assembly Hall through room GA-\r\n200, located behind the podium, before returning to\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly also approves\r\nthat recommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We shall now turn to section II.F.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the\r\nprovisions concerning explanations of vote and right of\r\nreply contained in paragraph 21?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I further take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to limit points of order\r\nto five minutes, as recommended in paragraph 22?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 23, in connection\r\nwith the length of statements, the General Committee\r\ndraws the attention of the General Assembly to\r\nparagraph 22 of the annex to resolution 51/241, which\r\nprovides that outside the general debate, there shall be\r\na 15-minute time limit in plenary meetings and in the\r\nMain Committees.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 24, the Committee\r\ndraws the attention of the Assembly to paragraph 23 of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the\r\n4\r\nA/55/PV.9\r\nimplementation of resolution 51/241 (A/52/855), which\r\nstates that since in plenary meetings the length of\r\nstatements in debates other than the general debate\r\naverages eight minutes, the General Assembly may\r\nwish to review the recommendation contained in\r\nparagraph 22 of the annex to resolution 51/241.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of paragraph 24 of the report of the General\r\nCommittee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of the provisions regarding the length of\r\nstatements contained in paragraph 25?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.G deals with records of\r\nmeetings.\r\nIn paragraph 26, the General Committee took\r\nnote of the fact that verbatim records would be\r\nprovided during the fifty-fifth session for the plenary\r\nmeetings of the General Assembly and for the meetings\r\nof the First Committee, and that summary records\r\nwould be provided for the meetings of the General\r\nCommittee and the other Main Committees of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves the\r\nrecommendation contained in paragraph 26 concerning\r\ntranscriptions of the debates of some of the meetings of\r\nthe Special Political and Decolonization Committee\r\n(Fourth Committee)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\napproves the recommendation also contained in\r\nparagraph 26 that the practice not to reproduce in\r\nextenso statements made in a Main Committee be\r\nmaintained for the fifty-fifth session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.H concerns concluding\r\nstatements in the General Assembly and the Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of that section?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.I concerns resolutions.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of the provisions contained in paragraphs 28 to\r\n31?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to section II.J,\r\nconcerning documentation.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of the provision relating to reports of the\r\nSecretary-General or subsidiary organs contained in\r\nparagraph 32?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 33, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to paragraph 6 of its resolution 48/264 and to\r\nparagraph 5 of Section C of resolution 54/248 of 23\r\nDecember 1999, which emphasize that documentation\r\nbe available in accordance with the six-week rule for\r\nthe distribution of documents simultaneously in each of\r\nthe six official languages of the General Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nparagraph 33?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 34, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to paragraph 32 of the annex to resolution\r\n51/241, appealing to all bodies to exercise restraint in\r\nmaking proposals containing requests for new reports\r\nand to biennialize and triennialize the presentation of\r\nreports.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of that paragraph?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.K refers to questions\r\nrelated to the programme budget.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of the provisions contained in paragraphs 35 to\r\n37?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 38, which concerns\r\nsubparagraph 13 (d) of decision 34/401, the General\r\nCommittee draws the Assembly’s attention to the\r\nobservations of the Secretary-General regarding the\r\nfact that the preparation of a statement of programme\r\n5\r\nA/55/PV.9\r\nbudget implications by the Secretary-General may take\r\na few days. In addition, the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee need adequate time to review the\r\nprogramme budget implications of a draft resolution\r\nbefore the draft resolution can be acted on by the\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General thus considers it desirable\r\nthat Member States submit proposals sufficiently in\r\nadvance to avoid the cancellation of meetings and the\r\npostponement of consideration of items.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the\r\nobservations of the Secretary-General contained in\r\nparagraph 38?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 39, the General\r\nCommittee, at the suggestion of the Secretary-General,\r\nalso draws the attention of the General Assembly to\r\nsection VI of its resolution 45/248 B of 21 December\r\n1990, on procedures for administrative and budgetary\r\nmatters, and to resolution 52/220 of 22 December\r\n1997, by which the provisions of resolution 45/248 B\r\nwere reaffirmed.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of the provisions contained in paragraph 39?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.L concerns\r\nobservances and commemorative meetings.\r\nWe turn first to paragraph 40. The General\r\nCommittee recommends that, with the exception of the\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, the General\r\nAssembly should adopt the suggested format for\r\ncommemorative meetings, including limiting each\r\nstatement to 15 minutes.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves the\r\nrecommendations contained in paragraph 40?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\nalso approves the recommendation contained in\r\nparagraph 41 regarding the scheduling of observances\r\nand commemorative meetings?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I now invite the General\r\nAssembly to turn to section II.M, which refers to\r\nspecial conferences.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves the\r\nrecommendations referred to in paragraphs 42 and 43?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In section II.N, concerning\r\nmeetings of subsidiary organs, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the General Assembly, on the strict\r\nunderstanding that meetings would have to be\r\naccommodated within available facilities and services,\r\nthat the subsidiary organs referred to in paragraph 44\r\nbe authorized to meet during the main part of the fifty-\r\nfifth session.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly approves\r\nthat recommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We now turn to section III of the\r\nreport of the General Committee, which contains\r\nobservations on the organization of future sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly. In paragraph 45, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to paragraph 17 of the annex to resolution\r\n51/241, which states, inter alia, that the\r\n“plenary meetings of the General Assembly shall\r\nbe formally opened every year on the first\r\nTuesday following 1 September”.\r\nIn that connection, the Committee also draws the\r\nattention of the Assembly to the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the implementation of resolution\r\n51/241 (A/52/855), in particular to paragraphs 16 and\r\n17, which highlight the subsequent action that needs to\r\nbe taken and the difficulty that will be encountered in\r\nimplementing that provision. As stated in paragraph 17\r\nof the Secretary-General’s report, in recent years the\r\nclosing date has been the Monday before the opening\r\nof the next session. Were the General Assembly to\r\nretain this practice, the closing date would consistently\r\nfall on an official holiday of the Organization, for\r\nwhich financial and other implications may need to be\r\nconsidered. Paragraph 17 of that report further states\r\nthat the General Assembly may wish to decide on a\r\nclosing date for future sessions that will fall on a\r\nworking day.\r\nIn paragraph 46, the General Committee, noting\r\nthe ad hoc decisions that had to be taken by the\r\n6\r\nA/55/PV.9\r\nGeneral Assembly concerning the opening and/or\r\nclosing dates of the fifty-second, fifty-third, fifty-\r\nfourth and fifty-fifth sessions, recommends to the\r\nAssembly that it address, during its fifty-fifth session,\r\nthe question of the opening and closing dates of future\r\nregular sessions with a view to deciding on a formula\r\nto determine the opening and closing dates of future\r\nregular sessions.\r\nIn paragraph 47, the General Committee, taking\r\ninto account the opening date of the regular sessions,\r\nalso recommends to the Assembly a review of the\r\nquestion of the mandatory deadline for the submission\r\nto the Fifth Committee of all draft resolutions having\r\nprogramme budget implications.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of paragraph 45 and approves the\r\nrecommendations contained in paragraphs 46 and 47?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We now turn to section IV of the\r\nreport of the General Committee, relating to the\r\nadoption of the agenda. It starts at paragraph 48.\r\nI would first recall rule 23 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, which provides that:\r\n“Debate on the inclusion of an item in the\r\nagenda, when that item has been recommended\r\nfor inclusion by the General Committee, shall be\r\nlimited to three speakers in favour of, and three\r\nagainst, the inclusion”.\r\nI should like to stress that at this time we are not\r\ndiscussing the substance of any item.\r\nWith regard to paragraph 49, may I consider that\r\nit is the wish of the Assembly to direct its Main\r\nCommittees to review their agendas with a view to\r\nstreamlining their programme of work, as suggested in\r\nthat paragraph?\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Again, may I urge members of\r\nthe Assembly to give careful thought to the suggestion\r\nby the Secretary-General, taking into account\r\nespecially paragraphs 23 to 26 of the annex to\r\nresolution 51/241, to consider deferring to a later\r\nsession items for which decisions or action are not\r\nrequired at the present session.\r\nIn paragraph 51, the General Committee\r\nrecommends that the consideration of item 59 of the\r\ndraft agenda, “Question of the Comorian island of\r\nMayotte”, should be deferred to the fifty-sixth session\r\nand that the item should be included in the provisional\r\nagenda of that session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 52, the General\r\nCommittee recommends that the consideration of item\r\n93 of the draft agenda, “Question of the Malagasy\r\nislands of Glorieuses, Juan de Nova, Europa and\r\nBassas da India”, should be deferred to the fifty-sixth\r\nsession and that the item should be included in the\r\nprovisional agenda of that session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 53, in connection\r\nwith items 171, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181\r\nand 187 of the draft agenda, the General Committee\r\nrecommends the inclusion in the agenda of the current\r\nsession of one single item, entitled “Scale of\r\nassessments for the apportionment of the expenses of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 54, in connection\r\nwith item 172 of the draft agenda, “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of\r\nEurope”, the General Committee recommends its\r\ninclusion in the agenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 55, in connection\r\nwith item 173 of the draft agenda, “Observer status for\r\nthe Inter-American Development Bank in the General\r\nAssembly”, the General Committee recommends its\r\ninclusion in the agenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\n7\r\nA/55/PV.9\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 56, in connection\r\nwith item 182 of the draft agenda, “Observer status for\r\nthe International Institute for Democracy and Electoral\r\nAssistance in the General Assembly”, the General\r\nCommittee recommends its inclusion in the agenda of\r\nthe current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In respect of paragraph 57, the\r\nGeneral Committee decided not to recommend the\r\ninclusion of item 183.\r\nIn paragraph 58, in connection with item 184 of\r\nthe draft agenda, “Towards global partnerships”, in\r\nparagraph 15 of document A/55/250, the item number\r\nreferred to should read “184”. A corrigendum to the\r\ndocument will be distributed. The General Committee\r\nrecommends the inclusion of this item in the agenda of\r\nthe current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 59, the General\r\nCommittee recommends that item 185 of the draft\r\nagenda, “World drug problem”, be deleted from the\r\nagenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 60, in connection\r\nwith item 186 of the draft agenda, “The role of the\r\nUnited Nations in promoting a new global human\r\norder”, the General Committee recommends its\r\ninclusion in the agenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 61, in connection\r\nwith item 188 of the draft agenda, “The role of\r\ndiamonds in fuelling conflict”, the General Committee\r\nrecommends the inclusion of this item in the agenda of\r\nthe current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 62, in connection\r\nwith item 189 of the draft agenda, “Financing of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea”, the\r\nGeneral Committee recommends its inclusion in the\r\nagenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to the agenda which\r\nthe General Committee recommends for adoption by\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nIn accordance with past practice, we shall follow\r\nthe numbering given in paragraph 63 of the General\r\nCommittee’s report (document A/55/250) and, where it\r\nseems appropriate, we shall consider items in groups. I\r\nshould like to remind members once again that, at\r\npresent, we are not discussing the substance of any\r\nitem, except when such discussion can assist the\r\nAssembly in deciding whether or not to include an item\r\nin the agenda.\r\nItems 1 to 6 have already been dealt with.\r\nWe turn to items 7 to 50. May I remind\r\ndelegations that we are dealing only with the question\r\nof the inclusion of the items. May I take it that these\r\nitems are included in the agenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that items 51 to 64\r\nare included in the agenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I now invite members to turn to\r\nitems 65 to 81, relating to disarmament.
