(Republic of Korea)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Sevilla\r\nSomoza (Nicaragua), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/56/1 and Corr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Kastrup (Germany): Later this afternoon,\r\nour Belgian colleague is going to speak on behalf of\r\nthe European Union. I would like to make some\r\nadditional remarks. Let me begin by thanking the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff for their thorough and\r\ndetailed report. This report impressively shows the\r\nwork done by the United Nations across a broad array\r\nof responsibilities. It includes new and fascinating\r\nchapters on recent developments in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe opening of this fifty-sixth General Assembly\r\nhas been postponed owing to the tragic events here in\r\nNew York, in Washington and in Pennsylvania. The\r\nwork of the United Nations came to a halt — but only\r\nfor a few hours. The Security Council then stated\r\nunanimously in its seminal resolution 1368 (2001) that\r\nthe terrorist attacks perpetrated against the people of\r\nthe United States of America present a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security, thus confirming a\r\nlegal basis for resolute action against the perpetrators,\r\norganizers and sponsors of the attacks. The General\r\nAssembly in its first resolution, after the tragic events\r\nin New York, Washington and Pennsylvania,\r\ncondemned those unprecedented and barbaric terrorist\r\nacts.\r\n“Achieving peace and security” is the title of the\r\nfirst chapter of the Secretary-General’s report. Peace\r\nand security are at stake, as the faceless and barbaric\r\nacts of terrorism were directed against the very fabric\r\nthat defines our nations: respect for human life and\r\nhuman dignity and the values of liberty, tolerance,\r\ndemocracy and peaceful resolution of conflicts.\r\nChancellor Schröder said in the German\r\nParliament a couple of days ago that the issue is not a\r\nclash of civilizations. The issue is whether there will be\r\ncivilization in this one world or not. The attacks are the\r\nexpression of a criminal mindset, which can target any\r\nof our nations, regardless of faith or social order. There\r\nmust be no doubt that there is no political or religious\r\njustification for terrorist violence. And no Member\r\nState of the United Nations should protect or harbour\r\nthose criminals.\r\nThe leaders of the European Union met last\r\nFriday in an extraordinary session. They discussed\r\nways and means of integrating as many countries as\r\npossible in a worldwide system of security and\r\nprosperity. Issues addressed included the provision of\r\nincentives within the framework of development\r\ncooperation to States that cooperate in the battle\r\nagainst terrorism. A particular priority in this context is\r\nthe creation of a basis for political and economic\r\nstabilization in the crisis regions. Above all, we must\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\ndo everything we can to achieve a breakthrough for\r\npeace in the Middle East.\r\nEuropean Union member States realize that\r\nterrorism must be fought on a global front. The\r\nEuropean Union has, therefore, called for the broadest\r\npossible global coalition against terrorism, under the\r\nUnited Nations aegis. The United Nations has a central\r\nrole in coordinating and reinvigorating the international\r\nresponse to terrorism. We trust that the Security\r\nCouncil and this General Assembly will live up to this\r\nrole. Members of the United Nations can rely on the\r\ncooperation of my delegation in combating terrorism.\r\nWe are ready to enter into negotiations on a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nThe Secretary-General has most pertinently\r\nunderlined that the United Nations must have the\r\ncourage to recognize that there are common aims, but\r\nalso common enemies. Our work on different aspects\r\nof globalization, and our desire to find answers to the\r\nchallenges of globalization, must include a resolve to\r\nglobally fight terrorism. Our work of implementing the\r\nMillennium Declaration should give high priority to\r\nour commitments in paragraph 9 to take concerted\r\naction against international terrorism and to accede as\r\nsoon as possible to all the relevant international\r\nconventions.\r\nThe United Nations must engage its full potential\r\nto identify and eventually eradicate the roots of\r\nterrorism. Development questions should therefore be\r\naddressed ever more vigorously. In this respect, we\r\nmust make sure that international terrorism must not\r\ninfringe on our common efforts and commitments\r\naimed at promoting sustainable development, an\r\nequitable distribution of the benefits of globalization\r\nand the achievement of the millennium goals, above all\r\npoverty eradication.\r\nWe must work for the full and timely\r\nimplementation of the plan of action adopted during\r\nthe Third United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, hosted by the European Union in\r\nBrussels in May. We must ensure the success of the\r\nongoing process, as well as of the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nin Monterrey next spring, and we must strive for a\r\nsuccessful, development-oriented round of the World\r\nTrade Organization in Doha in November.\r\nThe Secretary-General has widely stated in his\r\nreport, with a particular view to Central Asia, that the\r\nsearch for peaceful solutions to regional conflicts,\r\nwhich all too often are a breeding ground for terrorism,\r\nmust be identified. We should accelerate our pace\r\ntowards the establishment of the International Criminal\r\nCourt, as a timely response to combat impunity for\r\ncrimes against humanity. The dialogue among and\r\nwithin civilizations must be promoted as an antidote to\r\nblind and savage terror, bigotry and hatred. And the\r\nplight of those who suffer from terrorism, be it as\r\nimmediate victims or refugees, must be addressed.\r\nLet us use this session of the General Assembly\r\nto combine our efforts to make the United Nations\r\nwork and to take the necessary steps to implement the\r\nMillennium Declaration, including its reform package\r\nfor the United Nations. Streamlining our work and\r\nmaking the United Nations more responsive to global\r\nneeds and pressing problems remains high on the\r\nagenda. Germany stands ready to work in the General\r\nAssembly towards a successful fifty-sixth session.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): Before delivering my\r\nstatement on the agenda item before us, I should like\r\nonce again, on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Indonesia, to express to the people and\r\nthe Government of the United States our deep feelings\r\nof sorrow at the tragic events that took place on 11\r\nSeptember this year.\r\nOur grief at this unconscionable loss of life and\r\nmaterial devastation has no bounds, as the attacks took\r\nthe lives of people from many countries, including\r\nIndonesia. We strongly condemn such terrorist attacks\r\nand horrific acts of premeditated violence. Our deepest\r\ncondolences go to the bereaved families, and our\r\nsympathy goes to the countless victims affected by\r\nthese terrible events.\r\nIndonesia welcomes the annual report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization,\r\nwhich offers a comprehensive review of the activities\r\nthat have been carried out during the past year. It\r\nshows how the mandates of the Member States are\r\nbeing fulfilled in responding to the new challenges of a\r\nchanging world and embodies ideas and proposals that\r\ncould contribute to the further effectiveness and\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. It also depicts the\r\nfunctioning of the Organization and its\r\nmultidimensional aspects and the challenges the\r\ninternational community must confront at the\r\nbeginning of the millennium. From the details\r\ncontained therein we can see both its strength and\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nweaknesses, as well as a clear direction for the United\r\nNations in the future.\r\nThe Secretary-General reminds us that peace and\r\nsecurity remain an essential part of the Organization’s\r\nglobal responsibility and rightly highlights\r\ndevelopment cooperation as an overriding challenge\r\nsince a majority of the world population is mired in\r\npoverty. He has warned that in the era of globalization\r\ncritical issues cannot be resolved by States acting\r\nalone, but on the basis of cooperation, partnerships and\r\nburden-sharing among the Member States, the United\r\nNations, regional organizations and civil society.\r\nThus, when we speak of globalization, we speak\r\nof threats, weapons, communication, environment,\r\neconomy and other pertinent issues in a global context.\r\nAll this means far-reaching changes are taking place in\r\nworld affairs. No nation is immune to them. They\r\nrequire that we make fundamental adjustments in our\r\napproaches to global issues of concern and interest to\r\nall nations through a strengthened and democratized\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIndonesia’s participation in the Organization has\r\nbeen predicated on a firm commitment to the principles\r\nand objectives of the Charter. Beyond this, however,\r\nwe have attached particular importance to\r\nmultilateralism, whether regional or global, in\r\npeacefully resolving the myriad problems confronted\r\nby the international community.\r\nMy delegation is gratified to note the reference\r\nmade in paragraph 37 of the report to the ongoing\r\nendeavours being made by my Government in dealing\r\nwith a wide range of issues facing our nation. We\r\nregard our multi-party democracy and the existence of\r\nhuman rights as the central legitimizing tenets of good\r\ngovernance. We are now undergoing a profound\r\ndemocratic process based on openness, tolerance and\r\ninclusiveness.\r\nIn realizing the goals of a political system\r\nresponsive to the interests of our people, in\r\naccelerating economic recovery and in preserving\r\nsocial harmony, we have naturally attached high\r\npriority to the preservation of our national unity,\r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty, which precludes\r\nfissiparous tendencies. The national vision of Indonesia\r\nin the millennium would be the preservation of\r\ndemocratic pluralism and cultural diversity and the\r\ncreation of a modern State that will provide\r\nopportunities for its people regardless of ethnicity,\r\nreligion or other differences.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the importance given\r\nin the report to conflict prevention and peacemaking as\r\nan integral part of the Organization’s concerted efforts\r\nto maintain international peace and security. This dual\r\napproach would uphold the core mandate of the United\r\nNations and its mission to forestall conflicts, review\r\nmechanisms and institutions and formulate a strategy\r\nfor protecting humanity from indiscriminate violence\r\nand armed conflicts. The vital role of all parts of the\r\nUnited Nations system in reducing and eradicating the\r\nunderlying causes of conflicts has to be acknowledged.\r\nAppropriately, the crucial role of regional and\r\nsubregional organizations in preventive and\r\npeacemaking strategies is recognized in the report, as\r\nconflicts are inseparable from their regional contexts.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s intention to take a\r\nnumber of initiatives to forestall conflicts and to build\r\nan edifice of peacemaking, in particular, through the\r\ndevelopment of regional prevention strategies together\r\nwith the various agencies of the United Nations.\r\nIn this regard, the report has drawn our attention\r\nto the modalities adopted by the United Nations in\r\nAfrica and elsewhere. These include, inter alia,\r\nidentifying potential sources of conflict, promoting\r\ndemocratization, assisting in the political,\r\ndevelopmental and humanitarian fields, demobilizing\r\nand disarming combatants, fostering national\r\nreconciliation among the warring parties and\r\ndemonstrating the utility of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. Taken\r\ntogether, they offer some valuable lessons in the efforts\r\nspearheaded by the United Nations to achieve the twin\r\nobjectives of conflict prevention and peacemaking.\r\nWith regard to disarmament, the report has noted\r\nthe uncertainties concerning strategic relationships and\r\nthe persistence of diverse views on priorities.\r\nConsequently, there is little doubt that the question of\r\nnuclear disarmament has entered a new, dangerous era,\r\nas commitments undertaken at the 2000 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons have remained\r\nunfulfilled. Further compounding the situation is the\r\ndeadlock in the Conference on Disarmament.\r\nMeanwhile, it is disturbing to learn from the report that\r\nglobal military expenditure has registered a steep\r\nincrease in many parts of the world. These ominous\r\ndevelopments call for the resumption of negotiations\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\non the priority issues of disarmament, with the\r\ndetermination to reach agreement.\r\nAs for the economic sphere, we fully support the\r\nSecretary-General’s assertion, in paragraph 8 of the\r\nreport, that “development cooperation is a solid\r\nfoundation on which to build stability, economic justice\r\nand social development”. Certainly the work of the\r\nOrganization in assisting development and helping to\r\neradicate poverty and inequality will contribute greatly\r\nto establishing the building blocks of sustainable\r\npeace.\r\nThe defining moment for the United Nations in\r\nthe field of economic development in the past year was\r\nprobably the historic reaffirmation by Member States\r\nof the purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nand the adoption of the Millennium Declaration. In a\r\nworld of rapid globalization and economic integration,\r\nflexibility is imperative. We therefore agree with the\r\nreport that, in meeting the new demands on the United\r\nNations, the tradition of innovation should be\r\npreserved while the principles of the Charter are\r\nmaintained. Thus, in addressing the unbridled forces of\r\nthe market unleashed by globalization, including a\r\nwidening economic gap, we fully concur with the\r\nSecretary-General that unprecedented levels of\r\nfinancial commitment and international cooperation\r\nwill be required. I would even go further to say that if\r\nsuch an increase in international cooperation is not\r\nforthcoming, the economic gap will continue to widen,\r\nthe digital divide will not be bridged and the plight of\r\nthree quarters of humankind will further deteriorate,\r\nresulting in further poverty and deprivation for the\r\ndeveloping countries and instability for all.\r\nIn addressing such global problems, we could not\r\nagree more with the Secretary-General that the efforts\r\nto render globalization inclusive and equitable will\r\npose a daunting challenge in the years ahead and that if\r\nthe goals of development and poverty eradication are to\r\nbe met, economic growth must be accelerated in the\r\ndeveloping countries. Positive steps taken over the past\r\nyear in that direction include the cooperation of the\r\nUnited Nations in the formulation of national poverty-\r\nreduction strategies in 60 countries and its help in the\r\nwriting of comprehensive poverty-reduction strategy\r\npapers in others. Such positive steps can be clearly\r\nseen in the activities of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group, under the chairmanship of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nprime agency of the United Nations for promoting\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is encouraging that public sector management\r\nprogrammes in 78 countries have resulted in civil\r\nservice reform, national action to tackle corruption, the\r\npromotion of transparency and the adoption by some\r\nGovernments of results-based management to advance\r\npublic sector efficiency and accountability. We fully\r\nsupport these programmes and consider them to be\r\nextremely relevant to Indonesia in its current efforts to\r\nbuild strong democratic institutions and processes.\r\nIn this connection, UNDP, at its Executive Board\r\nmeeting in New York early this month, endorsed the\r\nsecond country cooperation framework for Indonesia\r\n(CCF). We appreciate the way in which the CCF has\r\nbeen prepared, involving broad-based consultations and\r\ndiscussions inclusive of government, civil society, the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations.\r\nIndonesia’s national priorities and four basic\r\ndevelopment goals were well reflected in the process of\r\nformulating the second CCF. These include the\r\nlegitimization of democratic governance, poverty\r\nreduction and institutionalized mechanisms for\r\nmanaging both social and ethnic conflicts and\r\nenvironmental sustainability.\r\nIn this context, we commend the full involvement\r\nof the United Nations in the forthcoming International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and its\r\npreparatory process. We also are thankful to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on this issue, which\r\nincludes a comprehensive set of 87 recommendations\r\non all key aspects of financing for development. We\r\nalso commend the Secretary-General for appointing the\r\nHigh-level Panel on Financing for Development,\r\nchaired by Mr. Ernesto Zedillo. The report of the Panel,\r\ntogether with other input at the national level,\r\nintergovernmental initiatives at regional and\r\ninternational levels and substantive contributions from\r\nother major stakeholders, should greatly help to\r\nenhance understanding and facilitate the tackling by\r\nMember countries of the issues and concepts of the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment.\r\nWith regard to access to information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICT), we agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that such access is an important\r\ninstrument for reaping the potential benefits of\r\nglobalization. Thus, we welcome the launching of the\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nUnited Nations ICT Task Force, which represents a\r\nmajor outcome of the 2000 high-level segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. We fully support the\r\nactivities and mission of the Task Force and trust that it\r\nwill vigorously promote accessibility and connectivity\r\nfor people from the developing countries, with\r\nparticular attention being paid to the rural poor and\r\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises.\r\nAs for the critically important issue of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, we are pleased to note from the report\r\nthat numerous initiatives and activities have been\r\nundertaken by communities at all levels in\r\nimplementing Agenda 21 and the relevant outcomes of\r\nthe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development. It is also encouraging that a growing\r\nnumber of companies have adopted sustainable\r\ndevelopment as an essential element of corporate\r\nstewardship. In this regard, we believe that all progress\r\nachieved on normative and institutional issues should\r\nbe coupled with the full implementation of\r\ncommitments undertaken, particularly by the developed\r\ncountries, as stipulated in Agenda 21.\r\nIndonesia, as a developing country that has\r\ndeveloped its own national Agenda 21 and sectoral\r\nAgenda 21, considers the support of the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations system to be crucial\r\nif we are to achieve our common objectives.\r\nFurthermore, since poverty and unsustainable patterns\r\nof production and consumption are considered to be\r\noverriding causes of environmental degradation, it is\r\nimportant that a bottom-up approach has been taken to\r\nthe preparatory process for the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, as that will best enable us to\r\nidentify ways and means of addressing those problems.\r\nLikewise, the launching of a poverty and environment\r\ninitiative will be of crucial importance in identifying\r\npractical policy measures to advance the twin goals of\r\npoverty reduction and environmental regeneration.\r\nWith regard to the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held in September 2002, Indonesia\r\nwould like to reaffirm its full support for the\r\noverarching goals of reinvigorating the global\r\ncommitments to sustainable development at the highest\r\nlevel and of ensuring the full implementation of\r\nAgenda 21. While taking note of the progress that has\r\nbeen achieved at local, national, subregional and\r\nregional levels, we are of the view that there is an\r\nurgent need to ensure that the approach will be able to\r\nidentify progress achieved and constraints faced, as\r\nwell as to provide practical and applicable solutions for\r\nachieving the full implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nIn this context, we believe that international\r\ncooperation, including that secured through the\r\npromotion of partnership, is crucial in ensuring the\r\nachievement of our common goals. Moreover, as\r\nChairman of the Preparatory Committee for the World\r\nSummit, Indonesia is deeply committed to the success\r\nof the preparations in the lead-up to a successful\r\nSummit. In the same vein, we share the view expressed\r\nin the report that there is a need to ensure the\r\nimplementation of all targets set by all of the heads of\r\nState, as outlined in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nIn the area of humanitarian relief, the report\r\nappropriately notes the need to achieve greater\r\nefficiency on the part of the aid community. In the days\r\nahead, this need will not diminish, but may, in fact,\r\nbecome more acute. Furthermore, my delegation would\r\nlike to note the progress that has been made in recent\r\nyears in protecting civilians threatened during armed\r\nconflict. That progress must not be lost, and every\r\neffort must be made to safeguard and protect civilian\r\npopulations, particularly women and children.\r\nIndonesia, for its part, will continue to contribute\r\ntowards achieving what the Secretary-General has\r\ntermed a culture of protection. We look forward to\r\nstrengthening our relationships at the national level,\r\nwhere Indonesia is still in great need of support, as\r\nwell as at the international level, in support of the\r\nprinciples of international humanitarian law. Thus, in\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance during armed\r\nconflicts, we must take fully into account the\r\ncontinuum from relief to development and the\r\ntransition from conflict to peace. As has been clearly\r\nindicated, failure to plan for and improve the transition\r\nbetween relief and development can undo short-term\r\nresults. We would therefore like to reaffirm our belief\r\nthat for disaster management to be effective, it should\r\ntake place in the context of poverty eradication and\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General also touches\r\non the issues of immunization and health. I would\r\ntherefore like to take this opportunity to note that,\r\nalthough the twenty-seventh special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been postponed, our efforts on\r\nbehalf of children must continue to move forward.\r\nIndonesia will continue to work towards achieving a\r\nworld fit for children. In that context, I am pleased to\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nreport that Indonesia has signed the two Optional\r\nProtocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nWe would like to applaud the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) for its tireless efforts in\r\npromoting the implementation of the Convention and\r\nfor ensuring the survival, protection and development\r\nof children everywhere, including in Indonesia.\r\nIndonesia hopes that during these uncertain times\r\nthe aspirations of those in vulnerable groups will not be\r\noverlooked. The Second World Assembly on Ageing,\r\nto be held next year, will offer an important\r\nopportunity to update and refocus our attention on this\r\nissue after 20 years. Likewise, issues relating to the\r\ndisabled and to youth must also not be lost in the days\r\nahead.\r\nThe Secretary-General has also appropriately\r\ntouched on the issue of gender and population, noting\r\nthe relationship between women’s inequality and their\r\nhealth, education and social and economic\r\nparticipation. Of equal importance, mention is made of\r\nthe zero-tolerance policy on violence against\r\nwomen — a policy that Indonesia has adopted and\r\nfully endorses.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, adopted last\r\nSeptember, our heads of State and Government\r\nsolemnly pledged to take concerted action against\r\ninternational terrorism and called upon States to accede\r\nas soon as possible to all of the relevant international\r\nconventions. Indonesia would like to underscore that\r\nterrorism increasingly threatens our democratic\r\nprocesses and national security. Hence, we look\r\nforward to the forthcoming deliberations in the General\r\nAssembly leading to the adoption of concrete measures\r\nof international cooperation to combat global terrorism.\r\nFinally, we are aware of the unprecedented\r\ncircumstances under which the general debate has been\r\npostponed and the consequent dislocation of the regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly. This has no doubt\r\nnecessitated a rearrangement and readjustment of the\r\nschedule and of the agenda of the current session, with\r\nthe cooperation and coordination of the President, the\r\nMember States and the Secretary-General. We remain\r\nhopeful that this will not necessarily constitute a\r\nprecedent and that the future work of the General\r\nAssembly can be conducted according to schedule.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): Allow me at the outset\r\nto extend to Mr. Han our warm congratulations on his\r\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-sixth session\r\nof the General Assembly. I would like to assure him of\r\nthe full cooperation and support of the Namibian\r\ndelegation.\r\nIt is significant that this body is considering the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization at a time when the crucial role of the\r\nUnited Nations will become even more evident, as the\r\nworld community ponders how to deal effectively with\r\nthe scourge of terrorism following the barbaric and\r\nindiscriminate terrorist attacks on New York,\r\nWashington and Pennsylvania on 11 September of this\r\nyear. We are saddened by the loss of innocent lives and\r\nthe destruction of property.\r\nI would like, therefore, to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress once again our profound sympathy and\r\nheartfelt condolences to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States of America, and to the\r\nbereaved families in particular. Namibia strongly\r\ncondemns this heinous crime and demands that the\r\nperpetrators be brought to justice.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive and all-encompassing\r\nreport. In our view, the report provides an important\r\nreflection on the significant achievements and other\r\nessential ongoing activities of the United Nations. It\r\nalso points to the problems and difficulties encountered\r\nduring the period under review. We subscribe to many\r\nof the thoughtful ideas of the Secretary-General on the\r\nefforts to enhance and strengthen the role of the United\r\nNations, but, at the same time, we share the deep\r\nconcerns he has about menaces such as conflicts and\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nWe are considering this report in the wake of the\r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration, in which our\r\nheads of State and Government pledged their collective\r\nresolve and responsibility to eradicate poverty,\r\nunderdevelopment and disease, and to uphold the\r\nprinciples of human dignity, equality and equity at the\r\nglobal level. In this connection, we note with gratitude\r\nthe Secretary-General’s road map, which offers a\r\nprogramme for the implementation of the objectives of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nAs time does not permit me to deal with all the\r\nimportant issues in the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nI wish to comment on some of them which are of\r\nparticular concern to my delegation.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nOn conflict prevention and peacemaking, my\r\ndelegation agrees with the importance that is placed on\r\nthe concept of conflict prevention, especially in the\r\nlight of the numerous conflicts afflicting the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General in his efforts to\r\nmove the United Nations from a culture of reaction to a\r\nculture of prevention. While it is the primary\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations to prevent armed\r\nconflict, in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, we believe that regional and\r\nsubregional organizations also play a crucial role. We\r\ntherefore call for improved coordination of efforts\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations.\r\nIn this connection, proactive approaches to conflicts\r\nhave already resulted in positive results in a number of\r\ninstances where multiple causes were threatening to\r\nexplode into much wider, devastating conflicts, which\r\nhad the potential to destabilize whole regions.\r\nHowever, as correctly noted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the development and humanitarian agencies of\r\nthe United Nations system, together with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, have a vital role to play in creating\r\na peaceful environment, as well as in addressing the\r\nroot causes of conflicts at early stages. The\r\ninternational community must furthermore begin to\r\nmatch rhetoric with action. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation looks forward to a further discussion of the\r\nimportant recommendations by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report on the prevention of armed conflict.\r\nWith regard to Africa, we agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that “efforts to enhance African\r\npeacekeeping capacity cannot become a justification\r\nfor reduced engagement in the continent” (A/56/1,\r\npara. 49). The United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole should continue to provide the\r\nnecessary resources to peacekeeping operations in\r\nAfrica, just as it does with peacekeeping operations\r\nelsewhere.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for\r\nexample, the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire\r\nAgreement is progressing smoothly. The ceasefire has\r\nbeen holding for some time now, and the parties are\r\nwithdrawing in line with their commitments under the\r\nKampala plan and the Harare sub-plans for the\r\ndisengagement and redeployment of forces.\r\nFurthermore, there is remarkable progress with regard\r\nto the inter-Congolese dialogue.\r\nDespite all these positive developments, phase II\r\nof the United Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) has not\r\nyet been completed. My delegation is of the view that\r\nin order to prevent a vacuum in the current favourable\r\nconditions, it has become critical for the deployment of\r\nphase III of MONUC to be approved speedily, with due\r\nconsideration of the complexity and enormity of the\r\npeacekeeping operation in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo. At the same time, it is important for the\r\ninternational community to assist the people of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in their efforts to\r\nrebuild their country.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Western Sahara,\r\nmy delegation has noted with deep concern the\r\nproposed framework agreement on the status of\r\nWestern Sahara. I wish to reiterate the position of my\r\ndelegation that the question of Western Sahara is a\r\nquestion of decolonization. Therefore, the aspirations\r\nof the people of Western Sahara to self-determination\r\nand national independence cannot be compromised. We\r\ntherefore believe that the United Nations settlement\r\nplan for Western Sahara, which has been accepted by\r\nboth parties, remains the only legal instrument through\r\nwhich to resolve the question of Western Sahara.\r\nEfforts should therefore be made to implement it and\r\nnot to undermine it.\r\nAs stated by the Secretary-General, the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic remains a catastrophe of global\r\nproportions. While we agree that the disease is\r\nspreading with alarming speed, it is most encouraging\r\nthat the international community is fighting back and\r\nthat, in their Millennium Declaration, world leaders\r\nresolved to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by\r\n2015. In this regard, my delegation welcomes the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS. We\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for the initiative to\r\nestablish a Global AIDS and health fund aimed at\r\nmobilizing resources to address the epidemic. We trust\r\nthat the international community will contribute\r\ngenerously to this fund. We support the establishment\r\nof a high-level inter-agency task force on HIV/AIDS\r\nwith the responsibility of strengthening coordination\r\nwithin the United Nations system.\r\nDevelopment and poverty eradication remain an\r\nimportant priority for the United Nations and\r\nindividual countries. The African continent bears a\r\ndisproportionate burden in overcoming these problems\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nof great priority. In his acceptance speech, the\r\nPresident made the development of Africa one of his\r\npriorities during his tenure of office as President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We\r\nwholeheartedly welcome that commitment. For its part,\r\nAfrica is showing its resolve to overcome its\r\ndevelopment challenges. The adoption of the New\r\nAfrican Initiative by the Organization of African Unity\r\nis proof in this regard. My delegation is extremely\r\ngratified by the decision of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to rally behind the unified framework that\r\nAfrican leaders have launched. We call on the rest of\r\nthe international community to do the same.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\nupcoming high-level International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey, which we\r\nbelieve should be convened within the context of the\r\ncommitments made at the Millennium Summit. We\r\nequally attach great importance to the upcoming World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development to take place next\r\nyear in South Africa. This will afford the international\r\ncommunity an excellent opportunity to review in a\r\ncomprehensive manner whether we, the Member\r\nStates, have implemented fully the commitments we\r\nmade at the Rio Summit. My delegation will continue\r\nto participate actively in the preparatory processes and\r\nlooks forward to a positive outcome of these meetings,\r\nwhich must fully take into account the needs of all\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nOnce again, my delegation wishes to assure the\r\nPresident of our support during his presidency, and we\r\nlook forward to actively participating in the rest of the\r\nwork of this session.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): Allow me to convey our\r\ncongratulations to the President on his assuming the\r\noffice of the President of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that his wise and able leadership will guide\r\nus through a session that has begun under a terrible\r\nshadow. We also place on record our appreciation for\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri’s stewardship of the last General\r\nAssembly. May I also thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization and for his\r\ntireless efforts in promoting peace and development.\r\n11 September was a dark day for humanity. We\r\ngrieve over the loss of so many innocent lives. We\r\nshare the pain, the outrage and the revulsion of the\r\npeople of the United States at the barbaric and\r\nsenseless attack on them.\r\nNearly half of the membership of the United\r\nNations is embraced in that grievous and colossal\r\ntragedy. We know, from our own bitter experience, the\r\ntoll terrorism exacts, particularly from open, liberal,\r\npluralistic and democratic societies. Over the last\r\ndecade, tens of thousands of our citizens — at work, at\r\nprayer, in schools and in hospitals — have died at the\r\nhands of terrorists; 250 more died on 11 September in\r\nthe World Trade Center. The human cost exacted from\r\nthe murdered and the maimed is incalculable. Left\r\nunchecked, the cancer of terrorism will spread,\r\nbringing more deaths and more destruction to more\r\ncountries. Condemnations do not touch terrorism. Its\r\nroots run deep and wide; they can be uprooted only\r\nthrough global cooperation and concerted action\r\nagainst terrorists as well as those who aid, abet,\r\nfinance, train, harbour or in any manner assist them.\r\nThere is no justification for terrorism, and none should\r\nbe accepted.\r\nWe would suggest that future reports of the\r\nSecretary-General should focus more closely on the\r\nissue of terrorism, given the universal condemnation\r\nand commitment to eradicate this evil that we have\r\nseen. We also hope that the comprehensive convention\r\nagainst international terrorism now under negotiation\r\ncan be finalized at this session of the General\r\nAssembly. Its early adoption and entry into force will\r\nprovide a framework for international action against\r\nterrorism.\r\nArmed conflict is the traditional threat to peace,\r\nprosperity and security. Studies show that the number\r\nof armed conflicts has dropped in the last few years,\r\nbut they still create instability and inflict suffering on\r\nmillions. While we agree with many of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the prevention of armed conflict, we believe\r\nthat action is required to strengthen and spread\r\ndemocratic governance, to remove poverty and to\r\nseriously address the question of disarmament. Above\r\nall, there must be respect for the principles of inter-\r\nState relations and a commitment to settle disputes\r\nthrough peaceful negotiations.\r\nIntegral to our efforts to end terrorism and\r\nprevent armed conflict is the denial to the perpetrators\r\nof access to arms and ammunition. We share the\r\nSecretary-General’s assessment that the Programme of\r\nAction adopted by the United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nAll Its Aspects is a significant first step, but we must\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nurgently and fully implement it while building a\r\nconsensus on the outstanding issues, particularly on the\r\nsupply of weapons to non-State actors, the risks of\r\nwhich are self-evident. We call on all States to join in\r\nkeeping weapons out of the hands and the reach of\r\nterrorists and non-State actors.\r\nBut while we address the problem of small arms\r\nwe must remember that complete and global nuclear\r\ndisarmament continues to remain an unfulfilled\r\npromise. The Secretary-General is right in reminding\r\nus that at the Millennium Summit our leaders resolved\r\nto strive to eliminate weapons of mass destruction,\r\nparticularly nuclear weapons. We will look carefully at\r\nthe strategies proposed in the road map for the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe have followed very closely, and supported,\r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to improve the\r\nSecretariat’s ability to support peacekeeping\r\noperations. We continue to be among the leading\r\ncontributors of troops and police to those operations.\r\nBut peacekeeping cannot be a substitute for the task of\r\nnation-building. Therefore, while we support the\r\nproper coordination of all elements in a complex\r\npeacekeeping operation, we continue to believe that the\r\nmandates of a peacekeeping operation should not be\r\nconfused with those of a post-conflict peace-building\r\nmission. Blurring the distinction between peacekeeping\r\nand post-conflict peace-building not only leads to\r\nunrealistic expectations and unachievable mandates,\r\nbut also prevents a clear exit strategy for United\r\nNations peacekeepers.\r\nThe crisis in the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone last year clearly reinforced the need for a\r\nstrengthened partnership between the Security Council\r\nand troop-contributing countries. While we are aware\r\nthat the Council has tried to address this problem since\r\nthen in its resolutions, unless the recommendations of\r\nthe Brahimi Panel — which have been amplified in\r\nproposals made by a number of troop-contributing\r\ncountries — are implemented, there are few prospects\r\nfor such a partnership emerging. The absence of\r\ncooperation between the Council and troop-\r\ncontributing countries has been a bane of United\r\nNations peacekeeping and needs to be comprehensively\r\naddressed at the earliest.\r\nWhile terrorism and armed conflict pose dramatic\r\nand violent threats, endemic poverty is the single most\r\nimportant challenge confronting humanity. In the\r\nMillennium Declaration our leaders resolved to reduce\r\nby half the number of people who live in absolute\r\npoverty by 2015. The Rural Poverty Report 2001 of the\r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development\r\n(IFAD) finds that this goal will not be met, as 30\r\nmillion people must escape poverty each year if it is to\r\nbe met, but only 10 million are able to do so. With a\r\nmuch sharper focus on poverty eradication, the United\r\nNations must strive to ensure that justice is done for\r\nthe members of the world’s population who earn less\r\nthan $2 a day. We note what it has been possible to do\r\nin the United Nations system so far, but we believe we\r\nneed to do much more.\r\nIn Africa the failure to eradicate poverty has been\r\nthe most acute. The rate of poverty eradication there,\r\naccording to IFAD, is six times too slow to meet the\r\n2015 deadline. The New African Initiative, adopted on\r\n11 July 2001 at the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) Summit, centred on African ownership and\r\ncalled on the rest of the world to complement its\r\nefforts. We note from the Secretary-General’s report\r\nthat entities of the United Nations have remained\r\ndeeply involved in a wide range of African\r\ndevelopment issues during the period under review. In\r\nour view, it is also important to ensure that African\r\npriorities and concerns are fully reflected in that\r\nengagement and that the process does not become\r\ndonor-driven.\r\nWhere have the development resources of the\r\nUnited Nations system been diverted to? The United\r\nNations Development Programme, the flagship of the\r\ndevelopment efforts of the United Nations system, is\r\nmentioned in 24 paragraphs of the Secretary General’s\r\nreport — in those dealing with crisis and post-conflict\r\nsituations, human rights, good governance and the\r\nGlobal Compact — but, curiously, never once in the\r\ncontext of technical assistance for capacity-building in\r\nareas that would have a direct impact on poverty\r\neradication.\r\nWe need to work collectively to ensure the\r\nsuccess of the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development, which is described as a unique\r\nintergovernmental process in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. For the first time, we will address development\r\nin a holistic manner from the perspective of finance.\r\nWe must use the opportunity provided by the\r\nConference to establish concrete measures and\r\nmechanisms that will ensure adequate, secure and\r\npredictable financial resources for development. An\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nequitable basis for global development has become the\r\ncrucial requirement in the management of the process\r\nof globalization.\r\nLinked to the outcome of that Conference will be\r\nthe success of the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, where the international community will\r\nidentify accomplishments and constraints in the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 in the last 10 years. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations system should help\r\nMember States and regional and other bodies\r\ncontribute to the preparatory process.\r\nWe are of the view that the integrity of the three\r\npillars of sustainable development must be maintained,\r\nand that environment cannot be de-linked from\r\ndevelopment. The global partnership forged at Rio is\r\nbased on that principle. The discussions under way on\r\ninternational environmental governance, mentioned in\r\nthe report, should take that into account. We believe\r\nthat the implementation of multilateral environmental\r\nagreements is essential for the protection of our\r\ncommon environment.\r\nThe advancement and empowerment of women is\r\nan important goal of the United Nations. It is a pity,\r\ntherefore, that there is nothing in the report on the\r\nprogress made in building on the outcome of the\r\ntwenty-third special session of the General Assembly,\r\non women, which was held last year. We are also\r\nmystified by paragraph 158, which claims that a non-\r\ngovernmental organization introduced a resolution at\r\nthe March 2000 session of the Commission on Human\r\nRights. We thought that only Member States introduced\r\nresolutions. We hope that has not changed.\r\nWhile the initiatives of the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) are\r\nimportant, the report restricts itself only to efforts to\r\nmonitor human rights. On the promotional side, an area\r\nthat is important to the developing world, the report is\r\nsilent, as it is on resolutions addressed to the\r\nSecretariat, for example on the issue of equitable\r\ngeographical representation in OHCHR.\r\nEqually important, the sections of the report on\r\nOHCHR’s activities do not reflect constraints\r\ndeveloping countries face in generating resources to\r\nimplement various rights, particularly economic, social\r\nand cultural rights. There is too much stress on the\r\nlegal aspect of international instruments rather than the\r\ndevelopmental aspect. There is an undue emphasis on\r\nthe question of legal instruments, rather than on the\r\nprogressive attainment of the goals of human dignity\r\nand freedoms, through the promotion and protection\r\nnot only of civil and political rights, but also of\r\neconomic, social and cultural rights.\r\nThe United Nations role in providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance is important. The report states\r\nthat the growing need for this assistance requires\r\ngreater efficiency in relief efforts. This may be so, but\r\nit misses the more important point that additional\r\nresources are required. The report notes that, as of June\r\n2001, less than 33 per cent of the requests listed in the\r\nconsolidated appeals for 2001 had been met. What is,\r\nhowever, even more troubling is that this seems to\r\nconfirm a trend. In 1994, 80 per cent of the\r\nrequirements were met; only 59 per cent were met last\r\nyear.\r\nThe report refers to the Guiding Principles on\r\nInternal Displacement as an over-arching framework,\r\nbut these do not have inter-governmental approval. The\r\nguiding principles for humanitarian assistance outlined\r\nin Section 1 of the annex of resolution 46/182,\r\nhowever, do have such approval. We therefore find it\r\nsurprising that there is no mention of them in the\r\nreport. The Economic and Social Council has this year\r\nagain noted that Member States reaffirmed the\r\nimportance and continuing validity of the framework\r\nprovided by the guiding principles established in\r\nresolution 46/182. These are what should guide the\r\nOrganization’s work.\r\nWe have taken note of what the United Nations\r\nhas done over the past year to harness information and\r\ncommunication technologies to advance the\r\nmillennium development goals. We recognize, as does\r\nthe last Human Development Report, that the belief\r\nthat there is a technological bullet that can solve\r\nilliteracy, ill-health and economic failure reflects scant\r\nunderstanding of real poverty. A judicious blend of\r\nbasic social, education and health services with the\r\ndevelopment of both brick and “click” industries is\r\nrequired for sustained human development and poverty\r\nreduction. Information and communication technology\r\n(ICT) is important in this context. Our own experience\r\nattests to this. We, therefore, strongly commend the\r\nSecretary-General on the establishment of the ICT Task\r\nForce. It can, in our view, play an invaluable role in\r\nbridging the digital divide, in fostering digital\r\nopportunity and in firmly placing ICT at the service of\r\ndevelopment for all.\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nOn enhancing management in the Organization,\r\nwe are heartened to note the Secretary-General’s\r\nassertion that the United Nations is now equipped to\r\noperate more efficiently and effectively, and to make\r\nthe best use of its financial and human resources.\r\nBut efficiency will not be able to make up for\r\ninadequacy of resources. We are therefore alarmed at\r\nthe news from the Secretariat earlier last month at the\r\nextremely precarious financial situation and cross-\r\nborrowing from the peacekeeping account to pay\r\nsalaries to staff members. We hope that the collective\r\nefforts put in by the membership of the United Nations\r\nlate last year will be rewarded, and that the financial\r\nsituation will improve in the next few months. We\r\nattach significance to this, as a country to which the\r\nOrganization owes the largest amount of peacekeeping\r\ndues.\r\nLastly, while peacekeeping continues to be\r\nstrengthened vigorously, including through the\r\nprovision of additional post and non-post resources to\r\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO),\r\nwe should, in this General Assembly, also strengthen\r\ndepartments that service economic and social sectors,\r\nwhere the biggest challenges to the international\r\ncommunity lie.\r\nMr. Satoh (Japan): I would like to extend my\r\nheartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Dr. Han\r\nSeung-soo, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of\r\nthe Republic of Korea, on his assumption of the office\r\nof President of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. The Government of Japan will fully support\r\nPresident Han, who brings abundant experience and\r\nkeen insight to this important office. I would also like\r\nto pay high tribute to His Excellency Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, former Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nFinland, for his leadership as President of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. And on this occasion,\r\nI am pleased once again to congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan on his reappointment as Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations.\r\nAt the outset, I cannot but express my outrage at\r\nthe series of terrorist attacks that occurred in New\r\nYork, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11\r\nSeptember. On behalf of the Government of Japan, I\r\nwould like to extend my most profound condolences to\r\nthe victims who have left homes and families in many\r\nparts of the United States as well as in many other\r\ncountries. My most sincere sympathy goes as well to\r\nthe bereaved families, and indeed to all the people and\r\nthe Government of the United States of America.\r\nThese acts of terror must be seen not only as\r\nassaults against the United States, but also as crimes\r\nagainst democracy and freedom, and more\r\nfundamentally, against humanity itself. The Member\r\nStates of the United Nations must remain in strong\r\nsolidarity with each other and committed to the words\r\nof Security Council resolution 1368 (2001) and\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1 in cooperating to\r\nbring to justice those responsible for the heinous acts\r\nand to strengthen our fight against terrorism. In\r\naddition, it is our solemn responsibility to work\r\ntowards the early adoption of the two remaining anti-\r\nterrorism conventions, namely, the comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism and the\r\nconvention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism.\r\nAs mentioned in the introduction of the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization,\r\nthe Millennium Declaration adopted at the Millennium\r\nSummit clearly laid out the challenges and objectives\r\nfor the international community in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The road map towards the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration, which the\r\nSecretary-General presented last week, provides\r\nguidelines for achieving those objectives. I shall\r\ntherefore present Japan’s views on the challenges\r\nconfronting the United Nations, focusing in particular\r\non the issues referred to in the Declaration. I would\r\nalso like to take this opportunity to request President\r\nHan to convene a meeting of the General Assembly to\r\ndiscuss the road map.\r\nThe terrorist attacks against the United States,\r\nwhich I touched upon earlier, pose a new and\r\nheightened threat to international peace and security.\r\nHowever, the world is not yet free from more\r\ntraditional threats to international security. On the\r\nKorean peninsula, for example, the old military stand-\r\noff still remains, with serious implications not only for\r\nregional but also for global security. It is for this reason\r\nthat the leadership of President Kim Dae-jung of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, which resulted in the historic\r\nSouth-North summit meeting held in June last year, is\r\nof a global significance. In the same vein, it is\r\nencouraging that with the fifth South-North ministerial\r\nmeeting, which took place from 15 to 18 September,\r\ngenuine progress is being made in the dialogue and\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nexchanges between the two parties on the Korean\r\npeninsula.\r\nThe Government of Japan will continue to\r\nsupport the tolerant policies of President Kim Dae-\r\njung, which have generated this momentum. At the\r\nsame time, while maintaining close cooperation with\r\nthe Republic of Korea and the United States, Japan will\r\nremain steadfastly engaged in negotiations with the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, with the aim\r\nof normalizing our diplomatic relations in such a way\r\nas to contribute to the peace and stability of North-East\r\nAsia.\r\nIn the Middle East, another hot spot with direct\r\nimplications for global security, the vicious cycle of\r\nviolence between Israel and Palestine has continued\r\nsince last year. The ceasefire measures taken by both\r\nsides on 18 September are a welcome development,\r\nand we urge the parties concerned to get back on track\r\nto implement the Mitchell report in order to achieve\r\ngenuine peace.\r\nFrom Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo to Kosovo and East Timor, the United\r\nNations is faced with a growing demand for\r\npeacekeeping. In view of the prospect of increased\r\nnumbers and expanded scope of operations, the\r\nJapanese Government is now considering further\r\nstrengthening its contributions to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. Japan will also continue to\r\nlead efforts to enhance the safety and security of all\r\npersonnel engaged in peace activities. Furthermore,\r\nrecognizing that addressing the small arms issue is\r\nincreasingly important in preventing the occurrence\r\nand the recurrence of conflicts, we are going to host an\r\nexperts group meeting early next year with the aim of\r\nensuring the steady implementation of the Programme\r\nof Action adopted at the United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nAll Its Aspects.\r\nNeedless to say, it is imperative for us to maintain\r\nand strengthen the arms control, disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation regimes. In particular, the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is an important pillar\r\nof the international nuclear non-proliferation regime\r\nbased on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. That regime provides a set of\r\nrealistic and concrete measures towards achieving a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free world. With this recognition, the\r\nGovernment of Japan will make its utmost efforts in\r\norder to attain the early entry into force of the CTBT.\r\nThis year, Japan will again submit to the General\r\nAssembly a draft resolution on nuclear disarmament t[-\r\nhat will outline a concrete path towards a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. I would therefore like to take this\r\nopportunity to ask Member States to extend their\r\nsupport to our proposal, as they did last year.\r\nI would also like to stress the importance of\r\nstrengthening the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production and Stockpiling of\r\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\ntheir Destruction (BWC). The new threat of globally\r\norganized terrorism, which we have witnessed here in\r\nNew York, makes our task all the more urgent. I\r\ntherefore hope that Member States will engage in a\r\nconstructive discussion at the Fifth Review Conference\r\nin order to make the BWC more effective in the\r\ncoming years.\r\nIn addition to issues relating to peace and\r\nsecurity, the international community is faced with a\r\nwide range of global issues, such as those relating to\r\npoverty, environmental degradation, refugees and\r\ndisplaced people, public health, narcotic drugs and so\r\nforth. While each one of them requires the cooperation\r\nof the international community, as the Millennium\r\nDeclaration has stressed, two issues — global\r\nenvironmental degradation and HIV/AIDS and other\r\ninfectious diseases — demand our urgent attention.\r\nNegotiations to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol\r\nwill go into effect in 2002 are at a critical stage. While\r\nI assure the Assembly that the Japanese Government\r\nwill spare no effort to attain that broadly shared goal of\r\nthe seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange, we also believe that it is important for all\r\nStates to follow the same rule as they implement\r\nmeasures to curb global warming. We therefore\r\ncontinue to seek the understanding and cooperation of\r\nall relevant countries, particularly the United States, in\r\norder to reach an agreement in time.\r\nI would also like to stress here that it is important\r\nto adopt at the Johannesburg Summit guidelines on\r\ninternational environmental efforts in such areas as the\r\nutilization of scientific technologies and water issues,\r\nwhere additional measures are necessary.\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nPromoting international cooperation in combating\r\nthe scourge of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases\r\nis yet another priority policy objective of Japan. On the\r\noccasion of the G-8 Summit meeting it hosted last year,\r\nthe Japanese Government announced the Okinawa\r\nInfectious Disease Initiative, under which it will extend\r\nfinancial and technical assistance amounting to $3\r\nbillion over the next five years to help combat\r\nHIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases in developing\r\ncountries. More recently, Japan has committed itself to\r\ncontributing $200 million to the Global AIDS and\r\nHealth Fund.\r\nWe believe that in order to address the issue of\r\nHIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, it is important\r\nfor the international community to develop a well-\r\ncoordinated approach to respond to the needs of each\r\ncountry in a wide range of areas, including education,\r\nprevention, treatment, the establishment of sanitation\r\nsystems and research and development.\r\nIn summary, what the Secretary-General refers to\r\nas the “war chest” will be essential to combat these\r\ndeadly pandemics. I would therefore like to take this\r\nopportunity to make an appeal for increased support for\r\nthe Global AIDS and Health Fund.\r\nIt is beyond debate that, unless the problems\r\nstemming from conflict and poverty in Africa are\r\neffectively addressed, there will be neither stability nor\r\nprosperity in the world in the twenty-first century. With\r\nthis recognition, since 1993, the Government of Japan\r\nhas been promoting the so-called TICAD process, the\r\nprocess launched by the Second Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development (TICAD II), with\r\nthe aim of enhancing the ownership of the development\r\nprocess by the countries of Africa and their partnership\r\nwith the international community. To further advance\r\nthe process, in December of this year Japan will hold a\r\nministerial meeting in Tokyo to prepare for a third\r\nTICAD summit, to be held within the next few years.\r\nThe Government of Japan welcomes the New\r\nAfrican Initiative launched by African countries, which\r\nis indeed a strong manifestation of African countries’\r\nownership of their own future. We look forward to\r\nhaving a substantive discussion at the forthcoming\r\nTICAD ministerial meeting on how the international\r\ncommunity can best support this initiative.\r\nPoverty, environmental destruction, infectious\r\ndiseases and other issues that I have discussed are all\r\nglobal in scope and cannot be resolved by any one\r\ncountry alone. It is thus becoming increasingly\r\nimportant to address these issues through global\r\ncooperation. In this context, Japan advocates the\r\nimportance of addressing these issues with a particular\r\nfocus on human security, that is, protecting the lives\r\nand dignity of people. Human security is the basic\r\nrequirement of humanity, no matter where people live.\r\nIt is our hope that the Trust Fund for Human\r\nSecurity, which the Japanese Government has\r\nestablished at the United Nations, will help advance a\r\nhuman-centred approach towards global issues in the\r\nyears to come. We also look forward to the valuable\r\ncontributions to be made by the International\r\nCommission on Human Security, co-chaired by\r\nMrs. Sadako Ogata and Mr. Amartya Sen, which has\r\ncommenced its work with the firm support of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan.\r\nThe debates last year during the Millennium\r\nSummit and the Millennium Assembly clearly\r\ndemonstrated that an overwhelming majority of United\r\nNations Member States support Security Council\r\nreform, including the expansion of both its permanent\r\nand non-permanent membership. Although the need is\r\nurgent and the momentum strong, we have seen no real\r\nprogress towards reform this year, the eighth year of\r\nour discussions.\r\nWe have to cooperate in order to move forward\r\non this important issue. The statement made by\r\nPresident Holkeri on the closing day of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly is highly significant\r\nin this context. In that statement, President Holkeri\r\noffered three suggestions, namely, that the discussion\r\nbe moved to a higher political level; that Governments\r\nmay want to consider approaching the goal of a\r\ncomprehensive reform in a focused way and by moving\r\nforward step by step; and that the question of the veto\r\nneeds to be part of these discussions.\r\nThe Government of Japan believes that these\r\nsuggestions merit our thorough consideration. We also\r\nconsider it advisable for our future discussions on the\r\nquestion of the size of the expanded Council to be part\r\nof a focused step-by-step approach towards the\r\nattainment of a final reform package.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to draw the\r\nattention of the Assembly to the two giant screens\r\nbehind this rostrum, the high-definition cameras behind\r\nrepresentatives’ seats and the two projectors on either\r\nside of the balcony. As the Assembly may recall, last\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nyear, NHK, a Japanese public broadcasting corporation,\r\ninstalled this equipment on a temporary basis for the\r\nMillennium Summit and the general debate.\r\nResponding to the wishes of the Secretary-General and\r\nmany Member States, NHK has generously agreed to\r\nlend the equipment to the United Nations on a\r\npermanent basis, free of charge. We all hope that this\r\nequipment will bring speakers and audience closer\r\ntogether, making our discussions more intimate and\r\nlively.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I should\r\nlike at the outset to congratulate the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the members of the Bureau on\r\ntheir election to their important posts at the helm of the\r\nAssembly for this session. I should like to express our\r\nthanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General, and\r\nto pay tribute to him for his report, which is under\r\nconsideration today.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General is\r\ncomprehensive, covering the activities of the United\r\nNations over the past year. The report refers to many\r\nimportant issues, including the attainment of peace and\r\nsecurity, the fulfilment of humanitarian commitments,\r\ncooperation for development, international law and\r\norder and human rights. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations is trying to build a\r\nworld based on justice and order. We also agree that\r\nthis can be achieved only through respect for the rule\r\nof law in international affairs, as there is no other way\r\nto ensure that brute force will not prevail at the\r\nexpense of the rule of law and the sovereignty and\r\neconomic and political independence of States.\r\nI should like to make several observations on the\r\nreport insofar as it relates to Iraq. First, in paragraph 31\r\nof the report, the Secretary-General expresses concern\r\nthat, since December 1998, the United Nations has not\r\nbeen able to verify Iraq’s compliance with Security\r\nCouncil resolutions regarding weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We would like to state that this conclusion\r\ndoes not reflect the reality of the situation or the true\r\nconcerns of the United Nations with regard to Iraq,\r\nwhich should be focused on the complete lifting of the\r\nunjustifiable sanctions. There can be no justification\r\nfor punishing an entire people. We had hoped that the\r\nSecretary-General would ask the Security Council to\r\nlift those inhumane sanctions, as the imposition of such\r\nsanctions is a practice of the Security Council that\r\ngreatly detracts from the credibility of the United\r\nNations and has transformed it into a tool of American\r\nforeign policy, which is hostile to Iraq.\r\nSecondly, the Secretary-General has expressed\r\nconcern about the halting of monitoring activities since\r\n16 December 1998. However, he has not expressed any\r\nconcern about the aggression unleashed against Iraq\r\nfrom 16 to 19 December 1998 by two permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, the United States and\r\nthe United Kingdom. This aggression took many\r\ninnocent civilian victims and destroyed numerous\r\ncivilian installations and facilities, such as hospitals,\r\ndesalination plants, schools and homes. The United\r\nNations has not taken any measures against that blatant\r\naggression — the State terrorism carried out by those\r\ntwo States.\r\nOn the other hand, several officials from the\r\nformer United Nations Special Commission, as well as\r\nCommission documents, acknowledge that the\r\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency were used by the United States, the United\r\nKingdom and the Zionist entity as a means of spying\r\non Iraq. They also acknowledge that crises were staged\r\nto justify the continuous aggression against Iraq by\r\nthose States, which falsified facts relating to earlier\r\nIraqi programmes, even going so far as to use the\r\nSpecial Commission to contaminate remaining Iraqi\r\nwarheads with VX chemicals.\r\nYet the United Nations — following American\r\npolicy, which is inimical to Iraq — has not taken any\r\nmeasures to investigate this shameful exploitation of its\r\nwork and mechanisms, nor has it taken any steps to\r\nbring justice to Iraq; to halt the use of United Nations\r\nmechanisms to harm it; or to punish those who are\r\nresponsible for harming it.\r\nThirdly, all fair-minded States — including three\r\nof the permanent members of the Security Council —\r\nhave stated that the file on the disarmament of Iraq has\r\nbeen closed, and that the time has come to implement\r\nparagraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687\r\n(1991), on the establishment of a zone free of weapons\r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East, and paragraph\r\n22, on the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq. Those\r\ntwo paragraphs have not yet been implemented.\r\nInstead, the United States and Britain have left no stone\r\nunturned in the process of rewriting Security Council\r\nresolutions, through, for example, the adoption of\r\nresolution 1284 (1999), whose very authors recognized\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nits inapplicability and which itself was not a solution.\r\nThat resolution, in effect, was stillborn.\r\nAn attempt was made to bring about the adoption\r\nof a resolution on so-called smart sanctions, which are\r\nactually intended to tighten sanctions against Iraq and\r\nto exempt the Security Council from fulfilling its\r\nobligations to Iraq — obligations that are set out in its\r\nown resolutions, in particular resolution 661 (1990)\r\nand resolution 687 (1991).\r\nFourthly, since 1991 the United States and Britain\r\nhave imposed no-fly zones on Iraq through a unilateral\r\nresolution and have used military power to enforce\r\nthem. They attack Iraqi civilian installations and homes\r\non a daily basis, and they have carried out widespread\r\nmilitary aggression five times since 1991. This\r\nunilateral use of force is a continuous, flagrant\r\nviolation of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nHowever, once again, the United Nations has\r\ntaken no steps to put an end to it, despite the fact that\r\nthe Secretary-General on more than one occasion has\r\nstated that there is no basis in the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions for the imposition of no-fly zones\r\nin Iraq.\r\nWith regard to the question of missing persons,\r\nthe Secretary-General has called for Iraq’s cooperation\r\nwith a “high-level coordinator” to return all Kuwaiti\r\nnationals and nationals of third States to their\r\nhomeland. We regret that the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has ignored the numerous Iraqi initiatives to\r\nresolve the question of the Iraqi, Saudi, Kuwaiti and\r\nother missing persons, the most recent of which was\r\nthe letter (S/2001/804) sent by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Iraq to the Secretary-General on 16\r\nAugust 2001, in which Iraq expressed the wish to\r\nresume the work of the Tripartite Commission on\r\nmissing persons, under the auspices of the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and with the\r\nparticipation of those States that hold files of missing\r\npersons.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General has also\r\noverlooked Iraq’s initiative to address the question of\r\nIraqi, Saudi and Kuwaiti missing persons in a direct\r\nbilateral framework or in the framework of the League\r\nof Arab States in coordination with the ICRC.\r\nA coordinator has been appointed to ascertain the\r\nfate of Kuwaiti and Saudi missing persons, but the\r\nsituation of Iraqi missing persons is being ignored,\r\ndespite the fact that their number is double that of the\r\nother two groups combined. This is a blatant example\r\nof the double standard used in Security Council\r\nresolutions vis-à-vis Iraq, even in cases of\r\nhumanitarian nature.\r\nThe question of missing persons is a humanitarian\r\none and requires cooperation on the part of us all to\r\nascertain their fate, regardless of their nationality. Yet\r\nresolution 1284 (1999), which was stillborn,\r\noverlooked that fact and dealt only with Kuwaiti\r\nmissing persons, disregarding those from Iraq, even\r\nthough international mechanisms, established by the\r\nGeneva Conventions of 1949, exist to deal with this\r\nhumanitarian issue.\r\nFifthly, the report referred to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s preparedness to resume dialogue with Iraq.\r\nWe would like to recall that it was Iraq that proposed\r\nthat a dialogue with the Secretary-General be initiated.\r\nThe first round was held in February 2001, and it was\r\nagreed that the second round would be held the\r\nfollowing month. However, the Secretary-General\r\ncalled for the postponing of that dialogue and, on 23\r\nJuly 2001, declared that the second round of the\r\ndialogue would be held once the Security Council had\r\nfinalized its deliberations. He also said that beginning\r\nanother round of dialogue would have adverse\r\nconsequences at a time when the Council was\r\nattempting to determine which direction to take.\r\nFor our part, we believe that dialogue with the\r\nSecretary-General must not be linked to political\r\npressures brought to bear in the Security Council —\r\npressures that have prevented the Council from\r\nfulfilling its commitments to Iraq. This is because of\r\nthe American threat of the use of the veto against any\r\ndraft resolution aimed at restoring Iraq’s rights, in\r\naccordance with the resolutions of the Security Council\r\nitself. In this connection, I should like to recall here the\r\nresponsibilities of the Secretary-General under Article\r\n99 of the Charter.\r\nSixth, the Secretary-General, in paragraph 109 of\r\nthe report, refers to the “oil-for-food” programme. In\r\nthis connection, we would like to make the following\r\ncomments.\r\nFirst, the Secretary-General states that the\r\nGovernment of Iraq’s delays in contracting\r\nhumanitarian supplies and equipment are of great\r\nconcern. Regrettably, that reference is inaccurate.\r\nDespite the tremendous difficulties and complex\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nbureaucratic mechanisms surrounding the contracting\r\nprocess, beginning with the dispatch of tenders to firms\r\nand ending with the dispatch of those contracts to the\r\nCommittee established under Security Council\r\nresolution 661 (1990), the Iraqi side has signed all the\r\nallocations for all the various sectors, at all stages of\r\nthe process. Indeed, the Office of the Iraq Programme\r\nwarned recently that some of the contracts actually\r\nexceed their allocations.\r\nThis is at a time when the implementation of the\r\nMemorandum of Understanding and the “oil-for-food”\r\nprogramme is experiencing continuous obstacles from\r\nthe United States and Britain as contracts worth more\r\nthan $4 billion are put on hold. These are humanitarian\r\ncontracts. More than $2 billion in contracts have been\r\nhindered by the Office of the Iraq Programme, under\r\nthe pretext of review. This is in addition to the\r\nsubversive role played by the representatives of the\r\nUnited States and Britain in the sanctions committee\r\nestablished under Security Council resolution 661\r\n(1990) with regard to the implementation of the\r\ndifferent aspects of the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding. They have objected to expanding the\r\n“green lists”, they have impeded the adoption of oil\r\npricing and cash earmarked for improving the oil\r\nsector, and lately they have tried to use this programme\r\nto collect information about Iraq and to threaten its\r\nsecurity and safety.\r\nIn this connection, we would like to refer to\r\nparagraph 56 of the Secretary-General’s note, entitled\r\n“The right to food”, document A/56/210, which states,\r\n“With regard to the principle that food\r\nshould not be used as an instrument of political\r\nand economic pressure, the case of Iraq is\r\nimportant. There can be little doubt that\r\nsubjecting the Iraqi people to a harsh economic\r\nembargo since 1991 has placed the United\r\nNations in a clear violation of the obligation to\r\nrespect the right to food of people in Iraq. This is\r\nthe opinion of, among others, Denis Halliday, a\r\nformer Assistant Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and former Humanitarian Coordinator for\r\nIraq, and of Marc Bossuyt, in his working paper\r\non the adverse consequences of economic\r\nsanctions on the enjoyment of human rights,\r\nsubmitted to the Subcommission on the\r\nPromotion and Protection of Human Rights in\r\n2000.”\r\nThis behaviour and these policies mar the role of\r\nthe United Nations in Iraq. The international\r\nOrganization and its Secretariat must, therefore, adopt\r\nan equitable and impartial position towards Iraq. The\r\ncontinuation of this situation victimizes innocent\r\ncivilians in Iraq. United Nations sanctions have killed\r\nmore than 1.5 million Iraqi citizens. The situation\r\nsubstantially diminishes the credibility of the United\r\nNations and its role, as specified in the Charter. It also\r\ncreates a dangerous precedent by allowing the use of\r\nfood as a means of social and economic pressure, and\r\nby ignoring continuous aggression over a 10-year\r\nperiod against an independent State and a founding\r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to draw\r\nthe attention of the General Assembly to the fact that\r\nStates are not allowed to exaggerate or distort the\r\nSecretary-General’s report to serve their own interests.\r\nThis is what the representative of Kuwait did when he\r\nclaimed that the Secretary-General in his latest report\r\nhas held the Iraqi Government responsible for lack of\r\nprogress and for delays in lifting sanctions against Iraq.\r\nThis is not contained in the report. The representative\r\nof Kuwait used the report of the Secretary-General to\r\noffend my country. This happens at a time when the\r\nrepresentative of Kuwait and his Government should\r\nbe governed by logic and not participate in daily\r\naggressions against Iraq, and not allow its territory to\r\nbe used by American and British aircraft to bomb Iraqi\r\ncivilians. Kuwait could have accepted Iraq’s offer to\r\npeacefully resolve the question of Iraqi and Kuwaiti\r\nmissing persons through the Arab League. That is logic\r\nitself.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation is of the view that\r\nthe United Nations must pay due attention to the\r\nquestion of Palestine because of its direct and serious\r\nimpact on international peace and security. Regrettably,\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General does not reflect this\r\nmatter in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.\r\nThe report does not refer to the long-standing atrocious\r\nterrorist practices carried out by the Zionist entity\r\nagainst the defenceless Palestinian people. Similarly,\r\nthe report does not refer to the Security Council’s\r\nfailure to provide international protection for the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): First of all, I would like to\r\ncongratulate the President on his election. Norway\r\nstands ready to cooperate fully with him as he carries\r\nout his important responsibilities.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor his excellent report on the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAt the outset of the report, the Secretary-General\r\nstates that the United Nations, during the past year, has\r\nwitnessed striking contrasts on the international scene,\r\nboth encouraging developments and dangerous threats.\r\nOn 11 September, we witnessed acts of heinous\r\nterrorism here in our host country. Those who lost their\r\nlives or were injured on that fateful day will always\r\nlive in our memories.\r\nThe Secretary-General has underlined the need to\r\nmake prevention the focal point of this Organization.\r\nThe Security Council has joined in these efforts, and its\r\nPresident issued a statement on 20 February saying, “a\r\nwell planned and coordinated peace-building strategy\r\ncan play a significant role in conflict prevention”\r\n(S/PRST/2001/5).\r\nNorway strongly endorses this approach to\r\ninternational peace-building, realizing that the world\r\nneeds to examine the underlying causes of conflicts in\r\norder to build a lasting peace. Fighting poverty,\r\nunderdevelopment and environmental degradation must\r\nbe at the top of our agenda. The world must also be\r\nwilling to meet its humanitarian commitments.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General states that the\r\nturn of the millennium, sadly enough, has not been\r\naccompanied by a reduction in the suffering caused by\r\nnatural disasters and complex emergencies throughout\r\nthe world. Vulnerable civilian populations continue to\r\nbe deliberate targets of violence. The report refers to\r\nthe conflicts that have continued in Afghanistan,\r\nAngola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nSomalia and Sudan, while crises have escalated or\r\nerupted in, for example, Burundi, Indonesia, Liberia\r\nand the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nAs in earlier reports, the Secretary-General deals\r\nextensively with the situation in Africa. As outlined by\r\nthe Secretary-General, the United Nations is involved\r\nin a large number of development programmes and\r\nother activities in Africa. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that Africa’s problems must remain of the\r\nhighest priority to the Organization.\r\nNorway continues to be gravely concerned over\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, which the Secretary-General\r\ncalls a catastrophe of global proportions. By late 2000,\r\nover 36 million adults and children were living with\r\nHIV/AIDS, while 22 million had died of the virus. We\r\nshare the Secretary-General’s concern that this is\r\nresulting in the destruction of the social fabric in the\r\nmost affected countries, reversing years of declining\r\ndeath rates.\r\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS. In sub-Saharan Africa the\r\nepidemic is now the leading cause of death. There has\r\nalso been a rapid increase in HIV infections in Eastern\r\nEurope and South and East Asia. The overall situation\r\nis of the greatest concern to us all.\r\nOn 11 September the world witnessed horrifying\r\nterrorist attacks here in the United States. The attacks\r\nwere not merely aimed at the American Government;\r\nthey were also aimed at hurting and weakening the\r\ndemocratic world as a whole. The world needs to stand\r\nunited in the fight against terrorism. Both the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council acted with urgency\r\nand determination after the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember. More needs to be done. Norway therefore\r\nlooks forward to the discussion on this issue here in the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 1 October.\r\nA natural focal point in the United Nations in the\r\ncontinuation of this process is to give even higher\r\npriority to the development and strengthening of the\r\ninternational legal order. In the work of preventing\r\nfurther atrocities like the attacks of 11 September, it is\r\nof the utmost importance that the international\r\ncommunity is able to identify and hold accountable\r\nthose responsible.\r\nNorway notes, and shares, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s optimism regarding the ratification process\r\nfor the Rome Statute for the International Criminal\r\nCourt. The International Criminal Court has the\r\npotential to become a vital instrument of international\r\nlaw and justice, and Norway welcomes its early\r\nestablishment.\r\nIn the first chapter of his report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral gives a broad description of the work done by\r\nthe United Nations around the world in its peace-\r\nbuilding efforts. The elections recently held in East\r\nTimor are among the many successes in those long-\r\nterm efforts. Nonetheless, the situation elsewhere —\r\nand especially in the Middle East — raises serious\r\nconcern. The Secretary-General describes the situation\r\nin the region as the worst crisis since the signing of the\r\nOslo Agreement in 1993.\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nThe outbreak of violence in occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory and in Israel since late September 2000 has\r\nbrought extensive loss of life on both sides. Norway\r\nfully supports the Secretary-General in his decision to\r\ndevote much of his time to addressing this particular\r\ncrisis, and encourages him to continue his efforts in\r\nthat respect.\r\nFinally, we appreciate the Secretary-General’s\r\ncontinued efforts in pursuing management reform\r\nwithin the United Nations. It is crucial for the\r\nOrganization to be able to address the shifting and\r\nchallenging tasks that lie ahead, and to do so in an\r\neffective manner. In saying that, I should add that we\r\nare impressed by the Secretary-General’s tireless\r\nefforts in streamlining the United Nations system.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia): We, too, commend the\r\nSecretary-General on his report.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to again extend\r\nAustralia’s condolences to those who suffered as a\r\nresult of the attacks in this city on 11 September.\r\nThe international environment has undergone a\r\nfundamental, paradigm shift in the two weeks since 11\r\nSeptember. Member States of the United Nations, and\r\nthe Organization as a whole, now face unprecedented\r\nand demanding challenges. This fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly will be like no other before it.\r\nThere is an immediate need to reassess our priorities\r\nand to refocus our energies in order to maintain and\r\nimprove the United Nations capacity to find\r\nconstructive solutions to urgent global issues.\r\nAustralia joined with other nations in\r\ncondemning the outrageous and cowardly terrorist\r\nattacks in this city and Washington earlier this month.\r\nWe believe strongly that Article 51 of the United\r\nNations Charter and Security Council resolution 1368\r\n(2001), of 12 September, give the necessary legal\r\nauthority to respond to those acts, including through\r\nthe use of armed force.\r\nFor the first time ever, we in Australia have\r\ninvoked the Security Treaty between Australia, New\r\nZealand and the United States (ANZUS), and stand\r\nready to support the United States and other allies in\r\ntaking whatever steps are judged necessary to bring the\r\nperpetrators of this and other acts of international\r\nterrorism to justice.\r\nThe fight against terrorism requires international\r\ncooperation. The international community has\r\nexpressed its opposition to terrorism many times,\r\nperhaps most notably in the United Nations Declaration\r\non Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism,\r\nwhich states the “unequivocal condemnation” by all\r\nStates Members of the United Nations\r\n“of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism,\r\nas criminal and unjustifiable” (resolution 49/60,\r\nannex, para. 1).\r\nAs important as those words are, they are not\r\nsufficient. Despite universal condemnation of\r\nterrorism, some States appear to have maintained their\r\nlinks with terrorist groups, and a few are still willing to\r\noffer sanctuary to terrorist leaders. This is unacceptable\r\nand cannot continue. Australia calls on all States to\r\nsever those links and to join the fight in deed as well as\r\nin word.\r\nExisting instruments and institutions provide a\r\nsound starting point for strengthened international\r\ncooperation. We note paragraph 224 of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, which welcomes the ratifications of\r\nand accessions to the 12 existing global conventions\r\nfor the suppression and elimination of international\r\nterrorism, and notes the continuing work towards a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism. Australia\r\nis already a party to 9 of the 12 existing conventions,\r\nand is actively considering becoming a party to the\r\nremaining instruments. We consider that a concerted\r\neffort must be made to conclude the negotiations on a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism at the\r\nforthcoming session of the working group in order to\r\nstrengthen the international regime. Australia will give\r\nits full support to that objective.\r\nAustralia stands ready to support all efforts to\r\nbring perpetrators of terrorist acts to justice. We urge\r\nthe United Nations as a whole to attach the highest\r\npriority to this issue at the current session and beyond.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has stated, one of the\r\nstrengths of the United Nations system is its capacity to\r\nadjust to changing international conditions. He has\r\nrightly observed that the Organization can remain\r\neffective only if it preserves that tradition of\r\ninnovation. Nowhere is this more strongly illustrated\r\nthan in the United Nations role in East Timor.\r\nTwo years ago, the Security Council entrusted the\r\nUnited Nations with comprehensive responsibility for\r\nmanaging and supporting East Timor’s transition to a\r\nstable, viable and democratic State governed by an\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\neffective administration. With the support of the\r\ninternational community, the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET)\r\nhas made significant progress towards fulfilling that\r\nmandate, including through the progressive transfer of\r\ngovernment responsibilities to the East Timorese. The\r\nelection on 30 August of a Constituent Assembly and\r\nthe swearing in of the new transitional Government on\r\n20 September were further critical milestones in that\r\nprocess.\r\nTo date, East Timor has been a success story for\r\nthe United Nations, but the Organization’s role is not\r\nyet complete. Australia fully endorses the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s judgement in his report that East Timor will\r\nrequire a substantial international presence after\r\nindependence if the transition to an effective\r\ndemocratic administration is to be completed. We fully\r\nshare the Secretary-General’s view that this\r\ninternational presence should be provided through an\r\nintegrated United Nations mission comprising civilian,\r\ncivilian police and peacekeeping components under a\r\nsingle Security Council mandate and funded from\r\nUnited Nations assessed contributions.\r\nThat is the most coherent and practical approach\r\nthat can be taken to handle the tasks and challenges\r\nthat still lie ahead. Its implementation will require the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole to take further innovative\r\nand creative approaches to East Timor, notably in the\r\nmatter of resources. It would be tragic to jeopardize a\r\nlonger-term peaceful and sustainable outcome for East\r\nTimor, and to waste the significant investment the\r\ninternational community has made so far, by failing to\r\nprovide adequate support after independence.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations as the\r\ncaretaker of East Timor’s transition is at stake. The\r\nOrganization and all of its Members have a\r\nresponsibility to protect that credibility, including\r\nthrough sensible but creative decisions on critical\r\nissues about the future United Nations presence in the\r\ncoming months. Australia will do all it can to support\r\nsuch decisions.\r\nFinally, I turn to another urgent global issue to\r\nwhich the United Nations will need increasingly to\r\napply a constructive, innovative and flexible approach.\r\nThat is the issue of people-smuggling, and, although it\r\nis not specifically addressed in this report of the\r\nSecretary-General, we hope it will attract increased\r\nattention in the future. This is a growing area of\r\ntransnational criminal activity that trades on people’s\r\nhopes and fears and exploits existing international\r\nagreements that were designed for humanitarian\r\npurposes.\r\nPeople-smuggling is an issue of particular\r\nimportance in Australia, but it is also of increasing\r\nglobal concern. It is a problem that is beyond the\r\nability of any country or organization to solve\r\nunilaterally. As such it must be addressed nationally,\r\nregionally and globally. A coordinated international\r\napproach is required both at the source of the\r\nproblem — where many factors cause people to leave\r\nand, in many cases, to flee their homes — and in transit\r\nand destination countries that facilitate smuggling\r\noperations. We need also to examine existing\r\ninternational conventions and norms to ensure that they\r\ndo not inadvertently create opportunities for people-\r\nsmugglers.\r\nThe United Nations has an important and\r\nincreasing role to play in dealing with critical elements\r\nof that new and disturbing situation, including through\r\na renewed focus and more coordinated response to the\r\ncriminal gangs that prey on people’s hopes and fears.\r\nAustralia also supports efforts to address the\r\nproblem of outflow at its source. Accordingly, we\r\nwelcome the joint initiative by Mr. Lubbers, the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to\r\nconvene a forum on Afghan refugees following the\r\nmeeting of the Executive Committee of the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR) to be held in Geneva early next month. For\r\nour part, in addition to Australia’s considerable\r\nnational and regional efforts to address the issue of\r\npeople-smuggling, we strongly encourage a renewed\r\nand more coordinated focus on the issue by the United\r\nNations as a whole and by UNHCR in particular.\r\nMr. de Ruyt (Belgium) (spoke in French): I\r\nmake this statement on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe associated countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia — and the associated countries of\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nAllow me, first of all, to congratulate the\r\nPresident and the members of the Bureau on their\r\nelections, and to wish them every success in their tasks.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nThe President has already demonstrated, in the first\r\ntwo weeks of the fifty-sixth session, remarkable\r\nefficiency and speed of action in the face of the tragic\r\nevents that upset the plans he had drawn up for the next\r\nfew months.\r\nThe entire world agrees that the terrorist attacks\r\nof 11 September marked a turning point in the history\r\nof our times. The world has changed and nothing will\r\never be exactly the same again. The challenge before\r\nus is one of global proportions. The solidarity we have\r\nshown towards the United States must also be shown in\r\nthe fight we shall have to wage against terrorism. For\r\nmy country and the members of the European Union —\r\nand, I believe, for the great majority of States\r\nrepresented here — it is now clear that that the United\r\nNations will have to play an essential role in that fight\r\nand that, in the weeks and months to come, our\r\nenergies will have to be focused on the consequences\r\nof those unspeakable acts of aggression.\r\nAs the heads of State and Government of the\r\nEuropean Union stated on the occasion of their\r\nextraordinary Council session last Friday, the attacks of\r\n11 September are an assault on our open, democratic,\r\ntolerant and multicultural societies, and are a challenge\r\nto the conscience of every human being. The European\r\nCouncil considered that, on the basis of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1368 (2001), a response by the\r\nUnited States was legitimate. It also decided that the\r\nUnion would cooperate with the United States to bring\r\nto justice and punish the perpetrators, sponsors and\r\naccomplices of those barbaric acts.\r\nThe member States of the European Union are\r\nprepared to undertake such action according to their\r\nindividual means. Those actions must be targeted and\r\ncould be directed against States abetting, supporting or\r\nharbouring terrorists. Our commitment is therefore\r\nunambiguous, as should be that of the entire\r\ninternational community in the face of actions for\r\nwhich no justification is acceptable.\r\nAs this meeting has replaced the general debate,\r\nwhich should have taken place this week, allow me, in\r\nthe name of the European Union, to extend my sincere\r\ncondolences to the representative of the Government of\r\nthe United States, as well as to the many who have\r\nbeen directly or indirectly affected by this tragedy. I\r\nwould also like to extend my condolences to the\r\nrepresentatives of States whose citizens are among the\r\nvictims. Those of us who by virtue of our profession\r\nare New Yorkers by adoption will for a long time\r\nremain traumatized by the events that took place two\r\nweeks ago. That emotion should help us to respond\r\nstrongly and with unity to the desire of our\r\nGovernments that the United Nations should play a\r\nprominent role in the struggle against terrorism.\r\nLike many leaders throughout the world, the\r\nheads of State and Government of the European Union,\r\nat their meeting last Friday, called on us to set up,\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations, the largest\r\npossible global coalition against this scourge. The\r\nprimary responsibility lies, without any doubt, with the\r\nSecurity Council, which last week adopted a very\r\nstrong resolution, but since the call is addressed to all\r\nStates, it is essential that we also act in our Assembly.\r\nAs I said earlier, the response to the terrorist\r\nthreat can only be global and multilateral, and it is in\r\nthat spirit that the European Union has requested that a\r\nsubstantial debate on the fight against international\r\nterrorism take place in the Assembly beginning next\r\nweek. We sincerely wish to thank the President and,\r\nthrough him, all the Member States of the United\r\nNations that have unanimously accepted this proposal.\r\nI call upon everyone to prepare carefully for that\r\ndebate, which will itself help to prepare for the general\r\ndebate in November, which we would also like to see\r\nfocused on this subject.\r\nThe current debate on the report on the work of\r\nthe Organization gives us an opportunity to speak on\r\nthe activities of the United Nations during the past\r\nyear, but it also allows us to state our views on what\r\nshould be the priorities for its future activities. We are\r\npleased that the President inscribed this item as the\r\nfirst of the plenary session of the General Assembly.\r\nClearly, the first priority is the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the road map that has just been\r\npresented to us for implementation. The clear and\r\nprecise aims solemnly reaffirmed by our heads of State\r\nand Government at the Millennium Summit should be\r\npursued with perseverance, in particular those\r\nregarding the maintenance of peace and security,\r\ndevelopment, poverty eradication, and respect for\r\nhuman rights, for democracy and for good governance.\r\nWith that road map, we now have at our disposal\r\nan instrument that is both analytical and operational,\r\none that will guide most of the work carried out under\r\nthe aegis of the Assembly. We can accept the document\r\nas it is, but that does not mean that we entirely agree\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nwith every aspect. However, it is an indispensable tool\r\nfor maintaining unity of action and the spirit of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. We therefore call for it to be\r\nused to the full.\r\nThe European Union, just like the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the report before us, is deeply concerned by\r\nthe persistence of humanitarian crises in several\r\nregions of the world. Civilian populations continue to\r\nbe the first victims of armed conflict and to bear the\r\nheaviest burden. Together with the Secretary-General,\r\nthe European Union is outraged at, and concerned\r\nabout, acts of violence carried out against humanitarian\r\npersonnel, and therefore supports the process under\r\nway in the United Nations to reinforce the safety of\r\nhumanitarian personnel. It calls upon all Member\r\nStates and actors involved to respond to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal for a return to a culture of protection\r\nfor civilians. It also welcomes the work undertaken by\r\ninter-organizational networks aimed at improving the\r\nsituation of internally displaced persons.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the European Union\r\nalso places particular importance on the defence and\r\npromotion of human rights. It welcomes the\r\nreinforcement of the partnership between the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and other parts of the\r\nUnited Nations system. This has enabled humanitarian\r\nand peacekeeping operations to be more aware of\r\nhuman rights violations. We welcome the entry into\r\nforce of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen and the signature of the Optional Protocols to\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child. Finally, we\r\nheartily encourage the process of gender\r\nmainstreaming under way in the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nIn response to the Secretary-General’s appeal, the\r\nEuropean Union is committed to maintaining the\r\npolitical momentum in defence of the rights of the\r\nchild on the occasion of the next special session on\r\nchildren.\r\nWith regard to the Durban Conference against\r\nRacism, the European Union played an important role\r\nand is proud to have contributed, after long and\r\ndifficult debate, to the success of the Conference —\r\nsomething that was essential given the hopes raised\r\namong those who today still suffer from the effects of\r\nlong-standing racist attitudes or who are still subject to\r\nracial discrimination in their daily lives.\r\nDevelopment, sustainable development, the fight\r\nagainst poverty and specific action to benefit the least\r\ndeveloped countries remain, as indicated in the report,\r\npriority objectives of our Organization. We welcome\r\nthe efforts made in the past year. We were particularly\r\npleased with the success of the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on AIDS, which put the fight\r\nagainst this scourge at the forefront of our concerns,\r\nboth at the level of States and at the levels of private\r\nindustry and the medical community.\r\nThe European Union was particularly active in\r\nthe preparations for, and holding of, the conference on\r\nthe least developed countries, which took place in\r\nBrussels in May this year. We are therefore particularly\r\ninterested in the follow-up to the decisions taken at that\r\nconference, particularly in the area of trade\r\nliberalization. We also attach particular importance to\r\nthe preparations for the Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment. In that respect, we would like to draw\r\nthe attention of partners to the substantial efforts that\r\nare still necessary to identify priority areas of action\r\nwhere progress could be made in Monterrey, and to\r\nmobilize the attention and political will of our\r\nGovernments.\r\nI would like to conclude by recalling the\r\nremarkable progress made by the United Nations in the\r\nyear under review to improve the efficiency of the\r\nOrganization in the areas of peacekeeping and crisis\r\nmanagement.\r\nThe Brahimi report served as the launch pad for\r\nour work, whose results, although not entirely meeting\r\nour expectations, will make it possible for the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations to respond\r\nbetter to the challenges before it, challenges whose\r\nscope continues to surpass our collective means. But\r\nthe United Nations has also done good work in the\r\nfield in the past year. Among other things, I wish to\r\nmention the restoring of the difficult operation in\r\nSierra Leone, the success of the operations in East\r\nTimor, Ethiopia and Eritrea and, finally, the long-\r\nawaited launch of the United Nations Organization\r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n(MONUC), an operation closely followed by the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo has substantially improved over recent months.\r\nWe hope that the Congolese parties will be able to\r\nsustain the momentum of the Gaborone meeting, and\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nthat the signatories to the Lusaka Agreement will\r\ncommit themselves to solving through dialogue the\r\nproblems standing in the way of the full\r\nimplementation of the commitments undertaken.\r\nThe United Nations, with the European Union,\r\nthe United States and other actors, bears a large\r\nresponsibility in the actions of the international\r\ncommunity to restore peace in the Balkans.\r\nCooperation between international organizations\r\nfunctioned well throughout the past year. It was\r\nintended, among other things, to help the Republic of\r\nYugoslavia to manage the post-Milosevic era. Above\r\nall, it enabled us to contain the growing crisis in the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which\r\nthreatened to destroy all the efforts to maintain multi-\r\nethnicity as a basic tenet, together with respect for\r\nborders and regional cooperation, on which the future\r\nof this still too unstable region must be built.\r\nThe elections to take place soon in Kosovo are a\r\nnew and difficult step on the road that should lead all\r\ncountries in the region towards the European Union.\r\nWe have full confidence in the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which to\r\ndate has carried out its task in a remarkably balanced\r\nand determined way to help the inhabitants of that\r\nterritory to learn to live together on the basis of\r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\nBeyond what I have mentioned, there remain\r\nworrying trouble spots in the world where, for various\r\nreasons, our Organization is less present. I am thinking,\r\nfor example, of Burundi, West Africa and, of course,\r\nthe Middle East, where the attention of the entire\r\ninternational community remains focused even after the\r\nevents of 11 September.\r\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, beyond the\r\nsuffering it brings to the civilian populations, also\r\nweighs heavily on the stability of the region. We\r\nstrongly encourage the parties to seize the opportunity\r\nbefore them today to rejoin the path of peace through\r\ndirect dialogue on the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Fact-Finding Committee,\r\nwhich should allow the earliest possible resumption of\r\nnegotiations on the final status of the occupied\r\nterritories.\r\nMost of the problems mentioned in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report continue to mobilize our\r\nOrganization’s efforts. We should give him the means\r\nto carry out his task effectively, which involves not\r\nonly fighting against waste and bad management, but\r\nalso making available adequate financial resources.\r\nThe events of 11 September affected us all\r\ndeeply. They should now cause us to close ranks, to\r\ndevelop deeper solidarity, and to have more recourse to\r\nmultilateralism to meet not only the challenge of\r\ninternational terrorism, but also all the challenges born\r\nof the growing globalization of international relations.\r\nThe European Union will actively contribute to\r\nmeeting the major challenges before us and to develop\r\nits solidarity in all aspects of United Nations action.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nThese are not propitious times. Since yesterday, when\r\nthe debate began on the work of the Organization, the\r\ntragic events of 11 September have coloured our\r\ndeliberations, and quite rightly so, given that over 60\r\ncountries have their nationals on the missing list as a\r\nconsequence of the attack on, and the subsequent\r\ncollapse of, the World Trade Center towers. Our host\r\nhas suffered immeasurably. On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I send heartfelt sympathy and sincere\r\ncondolences to all the families who have lost their dear\r\nones, and to the Government and people of the United\r\nStates of America. Our hearts go out to them and our\r\nprayers are with all of them.\r\nAllow me to express our sincere congratulations\r\nto the President on his election to his high position. He\r\ncan count on my delegation’s support and cooperation.\r\nTanzania wishes to commend Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for the manner in which he has presented\r\nthe report on the work of the Organization. The report\r\nreviews the efforts of the Organization in terms of\r\nfinding constructive solutions to the fundamental\r\nproblems of our time, and with a sober recognition of\r\nthe complexities of the tasks facing the Organization,\r\nand, more important, it attempts to underline the\r\nenduring significance of the United Nations as an\r\ninstrument of global cooperation for the common good.\r\nMany delegations have made some commendable\r\ncontributions and raised some very interesting and\r\npertinent concerns, whose perspectives we share. On\r\nthe other hand, we agree with the Secretary-General’s\r\ncontention that\r\n“One of the United Nations strengths is its\r\ncapacity to adjust to changing international\r\nconditions … We must prepare for the\r\npossibilities of the future and meet the new\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\ndemands made on the United Nations.” (A/56/1,\r\npara. 3)\r\nHowever, we wish to specifically underscore\r\nsome of our own concerns, one of which is Africa’s\r\nchallenge of protecting and assisting refugees. As is\r\nwidely known, Tanzania has over the years continued\r\nto be host to thousands of refugees from neighbouring\r\ncountries. Their presence in the country creates an\r\nadditional, heavy financial burden for my country, to\r\nsay nothing of the security concerns, environmental\r\ndegradation, and theft and violence perpetrated against\r\nour people. Anybody reading paragraph 115 of the\r\nreport might conclude that Tanzania is hosting only\r\naround 100,000 refugees. The truth of the matter is that\r\nwe are currently hosting over 500,000 from Burundi,\r\nover 170,000 from the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and over 10,000 from Rwanda. The point that\r\nmy delegation would like to make is that there is an\r\nurgent need to ascertain the correct number of refugees\r\nworldwide and to recognize the tremendous burden on\r\nhost countries.\r\nMy Government is very appreciative of the\r\nassistance it receives from the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\r\nand other non-governmental organizations, as well as\r\nother Governments. The needs of refugees are great,\r\nbut those of the nationals in the regions hosting them\r\nare even greater. It is therefore important that the\r\nquestion of refugees should receive serious attention\r\nfrom the international community. A piecemeal\r\napproach, while offering temporary respite, does not\r\naddress the really critical questions.\r\nLet me turn to my dear continent, Africa. The\r\nreport of the Secretary-General devotes 12 paragraphs\r\nto Africa. I wish here to emphasize that now that\r\nAfrican leaders have adopted the New African\r\nInitiative as the beacon of a continental strategy for\r\ndevelopment, and bearing in mind the appeal of world\r\nleaders in the Millennium Declaration of September\r\n2000 for support for Africa, the stage is now set for\r\nmeaningful cooperation. Africa is determined to be the\r\nmaster of its own development. It is incumbent upon\r\nthe international community and the United Nations to\r\nform a new partnership that will speed up the\r\ndevelopment engine. Africa needs additional resources\r\nand technology.\r\nThe issues of conflict prevention, peacemaking\r\nand peace-building are very important to the African\r\ncontinent, where civil wars and conflicts have\r\ncontinued to be the order of the day in many countries.\r\nWe are happy that the Secretary-General devoted a\r\ngood portion of his report to discussing this important\r\nissue. Indeed, we share the Secretary-General’s view\r\nthat\r\n“While comprehensive and coherent conflict\r\nprevention strategies offer the greatest potential\r\nfor promoting lasting peace, they have never been\r\neasy to formulate or to implement.” (ibid.,\r\npara. 20)\r\nNonetheless, it is my delegation’s hope that all\r\nthe agreements that have been concluded after very\r\npainstaking negotiations will be adhered to by all\r\nconcerned. We owe it to the peoples affected to give\r\npeace a chance.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report touches on the\r\nthorny issue of poverty. In paragraph 129 we are made\r\nto understand that the international community\r\nresolved to wage war on poverty by launching a\r\nsustained campaign to make the right to development a\r\nreality for everyone. The Millennium Declaration\r\nraised the expectations of over 1 billion people living\r\non less than $1 per day. Concrete programmes and\r\nactions need to be worked out as a matter of urgency.\r\nBut, as the report goes on to underline, if the\r\ninternational community is to meet its goals of\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication, economic growth\r\nin developing economies must accelerate. Again, while\r\nwe recognize that the challenge is primarily ours,\r\ninternational support is critical in our common fight\r\nagainst poverty. This will entail, among other things,\r\nforging partnerships with other members of the\r\ninternational community. Africa and the least\r\ndeveloped countries will continue to bank on the\r\nsteadfast support and understanding of the developed\r\ncountries until our countries have attained the level of\r\nself-reliance necessary to enable them to make\r\nsignificant contributions on their own.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to make some brief\r\nremarks about the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which\r\ncontinues to be, as the Secretary-General correctly put\r\nit in paragraph 146 of his report, “a catastrophe of\r\nglobal proportions”. While it is true that the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic is a global problem, Africa is the continent\r\nmost profoundly affected by it. More than 25.3 million\r\npeople are living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nAfrica, thus making it the leading cause of death in that\r\npart of the globe.\r\nGiven its limited capacity, Africa cannot afford to\r\nbe left on its own in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In\r\nother words, in order to be able to halt the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS by the year 2015, as the world leaders\r\nresolved to undertake at the Millennium Summit had\r\nresolved to undertake to do, Africa must be assisted in\r\nterms of building its capacity to tackle the spread of the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and of other infectious diseases\r\nassociated with it. We wish to commend the efforts\r\ndeployed by the United Nations in terms of pursuing\r\nvarious initiatives aimed at assisting Governments in\r\ndefeating this scourge. We also wish to commend and\r\nexpress our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor the continued system-wide efforts to address the\r\nvarious aspects of the HIV/AIDS crisis.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report shows that a lot\r\nhas been achieved and that a great deal more remains\r\nto be done. The goals have been set, and the direction\r\nis clear. It is our considered view that, without\r\nadequate follow-up mechanisms, many of the goals\r\nwill remain pure rhetoric. Let us resolve to move to the\r\nnext level.\r\nMr. Kerim (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): Since this is the first time that I am taking\r\nthe floor during this session of the General Assembly,\r\nallow me to congratulate Mr Han on his assumption of\r\nthe presidency of the fifty-sixth session. My delegation\r\nis confident that under his skilful guidance, we will\r\nbring this challenging session of the General Assembly\r\nto a successful conclusion. Let me assure him also of\r\nmy delegation’s full support. My congratulations go\r\nalso to the other members of the Bureau.\r\nI would like also to avail myself of this\r\nopportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General\r\nupon his re-election. The report we are discussing is\r\nfurther proof that the right decision has been made.\r\nIn the wake of the tragic events of 11 September,\r\nour debate cannot be regarded as business as usual. I\r\nwould rather call it an hour of trial. Once again we are\r\nconfronted with the sad truth and a bitter\r\ncomprehension of the dark side of human nature. The\r\nperpetrators of this odious crime were blinded by\r\nhatred. We, for our part, must always keep our eyes\r\nwide open and not allow our conscience to be\r\nawakened only on occasion. Therefore, it is necessary\r\nto scrutinize the consequences of international\r\nterrorism and to undertake appropriate measures in\r\nboth the short and long run.\r\nLet me express, on behalf of the Government and\r\nthe people of the Republic of Macedonia, our deepest\r\nsympathy to the families and friends of all the innocent\r\nvictims of those barbaric terrorist attacks and convey\r\nour full solidarity and support to the Government of the\r\nUnited States and the American people.\r\nThis merciless carnage and senseless destruction\r\nwas, at the same time, an attack against the\r\nfundamental values of our Organization and what it\r\nstands for — that is, democracy, freedom, tolerance\r\nand humanity. My country, the Republic of Macedonia,\r\nwill work closely with the United States, the European\r\nUnion and all partners to combat international\r\nterrorism. All international organizations, particularly\r\nthe United Nations, must be engaged in the forefront of\r\nthis struggle.\r\nI should now like to come back to the actual topic\r\nof our discussion today, the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization. In our view,\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report and the road map\r\ntowards the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration should be considered as a whole. The\r\nSecretary-General deserves special acknowledgement\r\nfor taking an approach which makes the report less of a\r\nreview and more of a forward-looking document. The\r\nreport is comprehensive and coherent, and it provides\r\nan opportunity to devote special attention to the issues\r\nwe consider as being of utmost priority for the work of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nIt goes without saying that the role of the United\r\nNations, and that of the Security Council in particular,\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nremains of paramount importance. In our increasingly\r\nglobalized world, none of the crucial issues we are\r\ndealing with, in particular those related to peace and\r\nsecurity, can be resolved solely within a national\r\nframework. As rightly pointed out in the road map,\r\nthere is a need for concerted action against\r\ninternational terrorism. This can be accomplished, in\r\nour view, by not only signing and ratifying all of the\r\nrelevant international conventions and by completing\r\nwork on the remaining texts that are being drafted, but\r\nalso by setting up an international anti-terrorism\r\nnetwork that will operate worldwide.\r\nMy delegation supports the efforts to strengthen\r\nthe capacities of the United Nations peacekeeping\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\noperations and to improve coordination within the\r\nUnited Nations system, as recommended in the report\r\nof the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations. The\r\nfocus should be on conflict prevention. The Republic\r\nof Macedonia, as the host of the first preventive\r\nmission in United Nations history, is ready to share its\r\npositive experience to that effect.\r\nFurthermore, let me stress the need for enhanced\r\ninstitutional cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional and subregional organizations, as set out\r\nin the Millennium Declaration, to cope with the\r\nemerging challenges in different parts of the world.\r\nWhile recognizing the fact that the Security Council\r\nhas primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, we believe that the\r\nUnited Nations in general can only benefit from\r\nstrengthening institutionalized cooperation with the\r\nrelevant regional and subregional organizations.\r\nWe agree with the view of the Secretary-General\r\nthat the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade\r\nin Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects\r\nand the Programme of Action that was adopted there\r\nrepresent a significant first step at the global level\r\ntowards the goal of preventing, combating and\r\neradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons. However, we deem that there is a need for an\r\nenhanced follow-up process. The problem of small\r\narms and their proliferation has been of particular\r\nconcern to the Republic of Macedonia and the broader\r\nregion, especially after the civil unrest in Albania and\r\nthe conflict in Kosovo. This poses a serious threat not\r\nonly to the security and stability of my country, but\r\nalso to the broader region. Therefore, it is necessary to\r\ntake strong action to combat the illicit flow of small\r\narms and light weapons.\r\nIn terms of priorities, enhancing the capacities of\r\nthe United Nations in mobilizing resources for\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication deserves our\r\nspecial attention. In this regard, my delegation has high\r\nexpectations that the preparation process leading to the\r\nFinancing for Development Conference in Monterrey\r\nin March 2002 will have a positive outcome and will\r\naddress the specific concerns of countries with\r\neconomies in transition.\r\nThere is a need to build stronger partnerships\r\nwith other relevant organizations beyond the United\r\nNations system, such as the World Trade Organization,\r\nthe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the\r\nbusiness community, non-governmental organizations\r\nand others, in order to have them closely engaged in\r\nthe process. The fact that every fourth Member State of\r\nour Organization is classified as a least developed\r\ncountry is certainly no credit to us all. That is why this\r\nissue has to be given the highest priority. We also look\r\nforward to the upcoming Conference on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held next year in Johannesburg,\r\nSouth Africa, to review the progress in the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21.\r\nFinally, allow me to make a few comments on the\r\nparts of the report related to my country, the Republic\r\nof Macedonia. At the very outset of the crisis, the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia approached the United Nations,\r\nasking for close cooperation in order to prevent\r\nspillover effects from the immediate neighbourhood\r\nand to secure the northern border of Macedonia from\r\nthe Kosovo side, and recalling the need for full\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999). The Security Council and Secretary-General\r\nresponded in a timely manner, and resolution 1345\r\n(2001) was adopted. Within this context, we deem it to\r\nbe of crucial importance to emphasize the role of the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission in\r\nKosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in\r\ncombating organized crime and terrorist activities\r\noriginating from Kosovo.\r\nThe Framework Agreement, aimed at overcoming\r\nthe serious political and security crisis in the Republic\r\nof Macedonia, envisages an active role for the\r\ninternational community in facilitating, monitoring and\r\nassisting in its implementation. Within this context, it\r\nis necessary to ensure the return of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons to their homes within the shortest\r\npossible time frame. In that regard, we highly value the\r\ncontinuous assistance that the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR) and the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) are providing.\r\nThe lessons that have to be drawn from the\r\nsituation in the Republic of Macedonia are as follows:\r\nMacedonia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must\r\nbe preserved; there are no territorial solutions to ethnic\r\nissues; the use of violence in the pursuit of political\r\naims should be rejected completely; the multi-ethnic\r\ncharacter of society must be preserved. These\r\nprinciples, in our view, should serve as the basis for the\r\nassessments and activities of the United Nations,\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nparticularly the Security Council and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in their future activities, in a spirit of close\r\ncooperation with the Macedonian authorities.\r\nIn conclusion, once again I would like to assure\r\nthe Secretary-General of my delegation’s full support\r\nin his endeavours to strengthen the role and relevance\r\nof our Organization in the forthcoming period.\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): I should\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor his comprehensive and insightful annual report on\r\nthe work of the United Nations and for his important\r\nstatement to begin our discussion of this agenda item.\r\nMy delegation is very grateful that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s annual report contains a thorough review of\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations, which has been done\r\nin order to identify sustainable and workable solutions\r\nto the many challenges that confront humanity as a\r\nwhole. In light of the complexities of the challenges,\r\nwe also commend the Secretary-General for the\r\nprogramme of work he proposed in his report\r\n(A/56/326) to the General Assembly entitled “Road\r\nmap towards the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration”. My delegation will give its comments on\r\nthat report when the Assembly considers it later this\r\nyear.\r\nThe report clearly shows that, in our increasingly\r\nglobalized world of today, the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the promotion of\r\nsustainable development and social justice are closely\r\nlinked, and that the critical issues we are facing cannot\r\nbe resolved solely within a national framework. We\r\nfully support the Secretary-General’s view that\r\ndevelopment cooperation is a solid foundation on\r\nwhich to build stability and economic and social\r\ndevelopment. We further add that the United Nations is\r\nthe most suitable instrument to galvanize the common\r\nefforts of nations in this task.\r\nI wish to underline that my country fully supports\r\nthe essential role of the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of world peace and security. We welcome\r\nthe focus of the United Nations on conflict prevention\r\nand peace-building, and emphasize that the United\r\nNations should make greater efforts to address the root\r\ncauses of conflicts in a comprehensive and consistent\r\nmanner. It is true that in peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding central priority should be given to conflict\r\nprevention, as it would be much more costly and harder\r\nto settle conflicts once they have occurred. We note\r\nwith satisfaction that a good number of steps have been\r\ntaken by the United Nations in this direction.\r\nThe report also touches upon the question of\r\nsanctions, underscoring that they should not precipitate\r\nhumanitarian distress that undermines the viability of\r\nthe policy and of the instrument itself. The report also\r\nhighlights the adverse effects of such regimes on\r\ninnocent populations and third parties. Viet Nam\r\nstrongly believes that sanctions are blunt instruments\r\nand should be invoked only with caution, and with\r\nwell-defined objectives and time frames. Indefinitely\r\nimposed, such tools will be counter-productive and\r\nserve no legitimate purposes. In this connection, we\r\nwelcome the recent efforts made by the Security\r\nCouncil to develop benchmarks for smart sanctions.\r\nWe urge the Council to put these regimes under regular\r\nperiodic reviews and to lift those sanctions that have\r\nbrought about unwanted and adverse impacts,\r\nparticularly on innocent people and neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nViet Nam has been a persistent proponent of\r\nnuclear disarmament, and we are pleased that the\r\nSecretary-General reiterates the world leaders’ resolve\r\nand endeavour to eliminate weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons. Viet Nam\r\nshares the concerns that the continuing divergence of\r\nviews among States on priorities and perspectives\r\ncontinues to block further progress on global security\r\nand disarmament.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to join the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in calling on Member States to work together\r\nto realize the historic agreements reached at the 2000\r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We share as\r\nwell his concerns over the plans to deploy national\r\nmissile defences, which may lead to another arms race.\r\nAs regards the United Nations Conference on the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects, Viet Nam fully supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal to States to work harder on the issues\r\non which the Conference failed to achieve consensus,\r\nas well as to act upon the key recommendations agreed\r\nin the Programme of Action.\r\nA great portion of the report deals with the\r\nquestions of cooperation for development. We fully\r\nagree that development is a huge challenge to many\r\ncountries and to the United Nations itself. The report\r\nonce again emphasizes the determination of the\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\ninternational community to wage war on poverty and to\r\nlaunch a sustainable campaign to make the right to\r\ndevelopment a reality for everyone. In this campaign,\r\nthe report focuses on the efforts to render globalization\r\ninclusive and equitable as a key way to reach the goals\r\nof development and poverty eradication. We fully\r\nsubscribe to this approach.\r\nAlthough there is now much less enthusiasm\r\nabout the benefits of globalization as more adverse\r\nimpacts are revealed, there is no question that\r\nglobalization remains a powerful and dynamic force for\r\ngrowth and development. Globalization opens up\r\nmarket opportunities, expands technological transfers\r\nto developing countries and gives them much-needed\r\nfinancial resources through investments. It is of utmost\r\nimportance that a favourable environment for\r\ndevelopment be created to enable the developing\r\ncountries to take part in the global economy.\r\nMy delegation is satisfied with the thematic and\r\nanalytical overview of the work of the Organization\r\npresented in the report of the Secretary-General. Let\r\nme conclude by stressing once again our continued\r\nsupport for the Secretary-General’s leadership in his\r\nsecond term of office in our efforts to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations, to make our Organization a better\r\ninstrument of all Member States and to enable it to deal\r\neffectively with the challenges of our world today.\r\nFinally, I wish to join the Secretary-General and\r\nmany others who have spoken before me to express our\r\nprofound sympathy to the victims of the vicious\r\nterrorist attack and to the people and Government of\r\nthe United States of America.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item\r\nfor this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I\r\nremind members that, in accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 34/401, statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Bilman (Turkey): I apologize for taking the\r\nfloor at this hour, but I can assure the Assembly that I\r\nwill be very brief.\r\nIt has come to my delegation’s attention that,\r\nduring this morning’s debate, a speaker took the floor\r\nand, with reference to paragraph 39 of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, repeated a litany of his well-known\r\nallegations regarding the Turkish Cypriots. I just want\r\nto say that I believe that the Turkish Cypriot authorities\r\nwill properly respond to those allegations in due\r\ncourse.\r\nMr. Al-Awdi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): A few\r\nminutes ago, my delegation heard the statement made\r\nby the representative of Iraq. It is important for us to\r\nunderline some of the misinformation contained in that\r\nstatement.\r\nFrom the outset, my delegation wishes to stress\r\nits full commitment to the statement made yesterday by\r\nthe Ambassador of Kuwait. I reaffirm that Kuwait did\r\nnot affront Iraq in its statement. We merely referred to\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on Iraq’s non-\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions, as\r\nreflected in paragraph 31. We call on Member States to\r\nreread that paragraph. We neither misquoted it nor\r\ndistorted any fact, as the representative of Iraq alleged.\r\nAs for the issue of Kuwaiti missing persons and\r\nprisoners of war, we would make the following points.\r\nRelevant Security Council resolutions on Iraq and\r\nKuwait in no way refer to Iraqi missing persons.\r\nHowever, resolutions 686 (1991), 687 (1991) and 1284\r\n(1999) call on Iraq to extend all necessary cooperation\r\nto the International Committee of the Red Cross to\r\nfacilitate the repatriation of all Kuwaiti and third\r\ncountry prisoners of war and missing persons. Nowhere\r\nis reference made to Iraqi missing.\r\nNevertheless, the Tripartite Commission,\r\nentrusted with the humanitarian follow-up to the issue\r\nof Kuwaiti prisoners of war, agreed to discuss the issue\r\nof Iraqi missing. Iraq’s accusation that the Security\r\nCouncil is biased and has ignored the issue of Iraqi\r\nmissing is therefore false. The Tripartite Commission,\r\ncreated by the Security Council and to which Iraq is a\r\nparty, has taken up the issue, although the Council\r\nitself has never raised the issue of Iraqi missing. The\r\nTripartite Commission was established under\r\nresolutions of the Security Council in order to\r\nrepatriate Kuwaiti missing.\r\nSince the end of the war to liberate Kuwait, we\r\nhave yet to see our missing. The issue of Kuwaiti and\r\nthird country missing can be resolved only through\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Iraq’s so-called peaceful\r\novertures are merely attempts to circumvent the\r\nSecurity Council’s resolutions. We want the problem of\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\nKuwaiti missing persons to be resolved in conformity\r\nwith Security Council resolutions. The initiatives\r\nclaimed by representatives of Iraq are nothing more\r\nthan an attempt to evade Security Council resolutions:\r\ninitiatives are announced, then immediately withdrawn\r\nthe minute that there is any insistence on compliance\r\nwith relevant Council resolutions.\r\nWe firmly reject persistent Iraqi accusations\r\nagainst Kuwait concerning the use of United States and\r\nBritish aircraft flying from Kuwait to attack Iraqi\r\ncivilians. No aircraft take off from Kuwait to attack\r\nIraqi civilians. We all recall that at one time it was\r\nIraqi aircraft that attacked Iraqi civilians.\r\nMr. Hadjiargyrou (Cyprus): I regret that I have\r\nto take the floor in response to the statement made by\r\nthe representative of the Republic of Turkey. The\r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Turkey referred to the\r\nstatement of one delegation — meaning the statement\r\nof the Republic of Cyprus made earlier this morning —\r\nwith reference to paragraph 39 of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General. Paragraph 29 refers to the situation\r\nin Cyprus, which has been on the United Nations\r\nagenda for a very long time. It is there because, for\r\nalmost three decades, the Republic of Turkey has\r\ncontinued to militarily occupy part of Cypriot territory\r\nin violation of United Nations resolutions, including\r\nresolution 3212 (XXIX) of 1974, which was adopted\r\nunanimously.\r\nThe representative of Turkey, furthermore, stated\r\nthat they would respond with a letter from the Turkish\r\nCypriot authorities. I simply wanted to remind the\r\nAssembly that what the representative of Turkey means\r\nby “the Turkish Cypriot authorities” is an entity which\r\nhas been declared legally invalid and which has no\r\nstanding in this Organization. I want furthermore to say\r\nthat this is not the first time that we have witnessed this\r\npractice by the Republic of Turkey, that is, circulating\r\ndocuments issued by an entity which has been\r\ncondemned by the Security Council.\r\nMr. Al-Kadhe (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation is taking the floor to clarify some facts\r\nconcerning the points raised a moment ago by the\r\nKuwaiti delegation. When the delegation of Kuwait\r\nyesterday attacked my country, Iraq did not ask to\r\nexercise its right of reply, because the item under\r\ndiscussion related to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization. But my\r\ndelegation has now been forced to exercise its right of\r\nreply in the light of the misinformation and distortions\r\nuttered by the Kuwaiti delegation.\r\nI say once again that States are not entitled to\r\ninterpret in an exaggerated or distorted way statements\r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his annual report;\r\nthat would run counter to the diplomacy involved in\r\nour discussion of the report of the Secretary-General.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the Kuwaiti delegation that\r\nStates should have a chance to read the text of Kuwaiti\r\nspeech and that of the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nespecially paragraph 31. The Secretary-General did not\r\nhold Iraq internationally responsible, but the statement\r\nof the representative of Kuwait included a remark that\r\nwas untrue: that the Secretary-General holds Iraq\r\ninternationally responsible. That distorts the words of\r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nLet me turn now to the question of Iraqi missing\r\npersons. Iraq abides by Security Council resolutions.\r\nFor four years, Iraq participated in meetings of the\r\nTripartite Commission and the Technical Subcommittee\r\nto discuss the matter of missing persons from Kuwait\r\nand from other States. In response to a request from the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and\r\nin implementation of international humanitarian law,\r\nthe matter of Iraqi missing persons has become part of\r\nthe work of the Tripartite Commission, which\r\nperiodically meets at Geneva, and of the Technical\r\nSubcommittee, which meets monthly in the Iraq-\r\nKuwait border area. It was agreed to discuss the fate of\r\nIraqi and Kuwaiti missing persons in line with\r\ninternational humanitarian law. Iraq then stated the\r\nneed to give special attention to Iraqi missing\r\npersons — like that given to Kuwaiti and other missing\r\npersons. Within the United Nations, we do not disagree\r\non that matter, because it conforms to international\r\nhumanitarian law and with the work of the ICRC.\r\nIraq has taken many initiatives, but the\r\nrepresentative of Kuwait says that we are evading our\r\nresponsibilities and commitments. I want to state here\r\nthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq has\r\nproposed that a bilateral dialogue between Iraq and\r\nKuwait be held under the auspices of the League of\r\nArab States. Kuwait did not agree to that proposal. I\r\ncall here upon Kuwait to respond positively to the\r\ninitiative put forward by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs; we await a response. Only then will we know\r\nwho is trying to evade discussion of this subject and\r\nwho is seeking to exploit this humanitarian issue with a\r\nview to making political gains to harm Iraq and to\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.10\r\ncontinue the sanctions imposed on it, thus inflicting\r\npain and suffering on the Iraqi people. More than 1.5\r\nmillion citizens have been victims, which runs counter\r\nto the principles and purposes of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Kuwait, who wishes to speak a\r\nsecond time in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Al-Awdi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I am\r\nsorry to take the floor again, but I am obliged to do so\r\nin the light of certain facts. I did not attack Iraq in my\r\nstatement, as the representative of Iraq has said; our\r\nstatement is here and everyone has access to it.\r\nRegarding the Secretary-General’s information,\r\none has only to look at paragraph 31, which addresses\r\nIraq’s non-compliance with Security Council\r\nresolutions and asks Iraq to reconsider its position if\r\nthe sanctions against it are to be lifted. That country\r\nshould read this paragraph in order to know what is\r\ncontained therein. It refers to missing persons. Iraq\r\ntalks about international and humanitarian law, and yet\r\nit did not wish to participate in the work of the\r\nTripartite Commission. For political reasons, which I\r\nwill not go into at present, Iraq does not shoulder its\r\nobligations. As we have said, it is Iraq that is not\r\nresponding to the bilateral dialogue on Kuwaiti missing\r\npersons, including the latest initiative on a bilateral\r\ndialogue. We inform the Secretary-General that for us\r\nto sit down in a bilateral dialogue with Iraq, we must\r\nhave assurances from Iraq that it possesses information\r\non Kuwaiti missing persons. It is pointless to sit down\r\nin a bilateral dialogue with Iraq if Iraq does not have\r\ninformation. We have been involved in a dialogue thus\r\nfar without obtaining anything. They have told us that\r\nthey have 126 Kuwaiti prisoners but that they do not\r\nknow where they are located.\r\nMy delegation has said, and repeats, that we have\r\nwitnessed Iraq’s attempts to evade its obligations\r\nregarding international humanitarian law and the\r\nGeneva Conventions in connection with Kuwaiti\r\nmissing persons. This involves Security Council\r\nresolutions and the principles of international\r\nhumanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions. I\r\nrepeat this, and one needs only to read paragraph 31 of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report to assess the veracity of\r\nmy statements.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Iraq, who wishes to speak a\r\nsecond time in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Al-Kadhe (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\napologize for taking the floor again. However, I am\r\ncompelled to do so to show the real truth.\r\nParagraph 31 of the Secretary-General’s report\r\nincludes much information. However, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral never stated that Iraq is internationally\r\nresponsible. While the statement made by the\r\nAmbassador of Kuwait quotes the Secretary-General as\r\nsaying that Iraq is internationally responsible, that is\r\nerroneous. I repeat, erroneous. I leave it to States to\r\nascertain the text of this paragraph. The report is before\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nIn this Hall, I say and I repeat, there is not one\r\nKuwaiti or non-Kuwaiti prisoner in Iraq. The Tripartite\r\nCommission and the Technical Subcommittee are\r\nlooking into the issue of missing persons, not prisoners\r\nof war. As members all know, in Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991), the ceasefire resolution enjoined\r\nIraq to release all prisoners of all nationalities. Iraq has\r\nindeed released all prisoners of war to the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They numbered\r\nover 5,000. Meetings were held in Riyadh, attended by\r\nKuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, as well as by the ICRC,\r\nfollowing the ceasefire in order to release the prisoners\r\nto the ICRC, and therefore that resolution was\r\nconsidered to have been implemented. The release of\r\nprisoners of war was one of the ceasefire conditions.\r\nSurely the representative of Kuwait knows that.\r\nAs for the statement that Iraq never provided any\r\ninformation on Kuwaiti prisoners of war, that is\r\nincorrect. Kuwait provided 5,000 names through the\r\nICRC to the Government of Iraq, and we provided the\r\nrelevant information to the Kuwaiti delegation. Out of\r\n5,000 names on the initial list provided by Kuwait, 598\r\nnames remain. The current number of missing persons,\r\naccording to Kuwaiti files, is 598. I call on the ICRC\r\nand on its representative, if it has a representative in\r\nthis Hall, to kindly confirm or refute what I have just\r\nstated: 598 names remaining from a list of over 5,000\r\nprovided in 1991. That shows how much Iraq has\r\ncooperated in providing information to the ICRC. We\r\nare prepared to continue considering the issue of\r\nmissing persons. It is definitely a humanitarian issue as\r\nlong as it is not exploited for political ends, as is the\r\ncase now with Kuwait.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
