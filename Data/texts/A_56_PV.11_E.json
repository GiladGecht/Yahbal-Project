(Republic of Korea)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Ileka\r\n(Democratic Republic of the Congo), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/56/1 and Corr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): The despicable acts of\r\nviolence committed on 11 September in New York,\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania have cast a\r\nsombre shadow over the opening of this year’s General\r\nAssembly session. The outrage of the Government and\r\nthe people of Jamaica at the terrible toll in death and\r\ninjury has already been conveyed to the Government\r\nand the people of the United States of America, but I\r\nwish to reiterate our sincere sympathy and profound\r\ncondolences to the bereaved families. The orchestration\r\nof the attacks forcefully underscores the need for the\r\ninternational community to urgently take effective\r\nmeasures to eliminate terrorism in all its forms. It is\r\ntherefore fitting that the General Assembly will hold a\r\ndebate on this issue on 1 October.\r\nI should like to extend my warmest\r\ncongratulations to the Foreign Minister of the Republic\r\nof Korea on his election as the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session and assure him of\r\nthe full cooperation and support of the Jamaican\r\ndelegation. I would also like to express our deepest\r\nappreciation to Mr. Harri Holkeri for his excellent\r\nleadership of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-\r\nelection as Secretary-General and to reaffirm Jamaica’s\r\nsupport for and confidence in him and in his vision for\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI should also like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive and analytical report on the\r\nwork of the Organization over the past year, and for the\r\nframework for action which he set out to deal with our\r\nchanged realities. We have noted with satisfaction the\r\nreport’s attention to conflict prevention, peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building, within the wider mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nAn important achievement during the past year\r\nwas the Organization’s action to improve the way in\r\nwhich peacekeeping operations are designed and\r\nimplemented, so as to enhance the immediacy of\r\nresponse and the efficiency and effectiveness of the\r\ndelivery of assistance in conflict areas. This includes\r\nefforts to improve the system of consultation between\r\nthe Security Council and troop-contributing countries.\r\nWe therefore welcome the adoption of the report of the\r\nUnited Nations Panel on Peace Operations and its\r\nimplementation plan, and have sought to play an active\r\npart in its operationalization.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nJamaica also welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\ndemonstrated commitment to promoting a culture of\r\nprevention. Within this context, assiduous attention to\r\nthe root causes of conflict is critical to a proactive,\r\npreventive strategy in pre-conflict situations.\r\nExperience has shown that effective conflict prevention\r\ndemands an integrated approach to sustainable\r\neconomic development, the promotion of social justice\r\nand the protection of human rights. Jamaica will\r\ntherefore continue to advocate a coordinated approach\r\nto conflict prevention, involving the entire United\r\nNations system.\r\nThe strengthening of civilian missions to enhance\r\npost-conflict peace-building strategies is also deserving\r\nof greater attention. We continue to be concerned at the\r\nrelative paucity of resources earmarked for the\r\nrebuilding of post-conflict societies. Without this much\r\nneeded support to make adequate provision for the\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of former combatants\r\nand to ensure the establishment of sound institutional\r\ninfrastructure, the significant investment made in the\r\npeacekeeping phase of operations may result in\r\nprecious little return. We believe that regional and\r\nsubregional organizations can play an important\r\nsupportive role. We welcome the multidisciplinary\r\napproach taken by the Secretary-General, particularly\r\nin regard to situations in West Africa, in cooperation\r\nwith the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), and the proposed establishment of a\r\nUnited Nations Office in West Africa to enhance the\r\nOrganization’s capacity for monitoring, early warning\r\nand conflict prevention in the subregion.\r\nIn regard to our own region, Jamaica places great\r\nstore in the continued work of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States and of the Caribbean Community in\r\nHaiti, in cooperation with the United Nations.\r\nThe urgency of humanitarian concerns in conflict\r\nareas has brought into sharper focus the need to protect\r\ncivilians affected by armed conflict. Deliberate attacks\r\nagainst civilians, humanitarian workers and other non-\r\ncombatants demonstrate that there is a clear need for\r\nthe Organization to continue to insist on full respect at\r\nall levels for the principles of international law,\r\nparticularly human rights and humanitarian law. It is\r\nincumbent on the international community to ensure\r\nthat those who target civilians are brought to justice. To\r\nthis end, we strongly support the work of the\r\ninternational criminal tribunals and look forward to the\r\nearly establishment of the International Criminal Court.\r\nJamaica is also particularly gratified at the\r\nincreased sensitivity to the disproportionate effects of\r\nwar on women and children, and at the growing\r\nappreciation for the valuable contribution that women\r\ncan make towards the prevention and resolution of\r\nconflict. Efforts to ensure adequate representation of\r\nwomen at all levels of the decision-making process,\r\nfrom conflict prevention to peace-building, must\r\ntherefore be pursued. In this regard, the decisions of\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly to\r\nincorporate a gender perspective in peacekeeping\r\noperations are welcome.\r\nThe international community, at its historic\r\nMillennium Assembly last year, set the foundation and\r\nframework for a people-centred development agenda.\r\nWe committed ourselves to the implementation of a\r\nstrategy to enrich and sustain the quality of life of the\r\nbroadest cross-section of the world’s people,\r\nparticularly the poor.\r\nAs we now seek to consolidate the institutional\r\npriorities for the United Nations, let us ensure that the\r\nsecurity and well-being of the individual continues to\r\nassume a central place on our agenda. The Secretary\r\nGeneral’s “Road map towards the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration” (A/56/326) is an\r\nimportant contribution. So, too, are the\r\nintergovernmental processes that engaged our attention\r\nover the past year.\r\nIn July, the pledge of the international community\r\nto implement measures aimed at eradicating extreme\r\npoverty was reaffirmed in the Brussels Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action, adopted at the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.\r\nOur engagement in the preparatory processes for the\r\nspecial session on children, the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development has\r\ndemonstrated, at the very least, a readiness to grapple\r\nwith the vexing issues and the challenges that represent\r\nthe spectrum of the development agenda.\r\nWe also reviewed, as a matter of urgency, the\r\nalarming spread of HIV/AIDS and its devastating\r\neffect on seriously affected States. Our attention was\r\ngiven in particular to the plight of Africa, where the\r\nravages of the disease overwhelm the health-care\r\nsystems, destroy the social fabric, undermine the\r\ndevelopment capacity of many economies and decimate\r\npopulations. The fortunes of the countries of the\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nCaribbean are but one step removed from that of\r\nAfrica, our subregion claiming the second fastest\r\nprevalence rate in the world.\r\nIt is appropriate that the threat of HIV/AIDS is\r\nbeing addressed as a development challenge — one\r\nthat threatens not only the future growth and prosperity\r\nof the affected countries, but also the security of States.\r\nJamaica welcomed the plan of action adopted at the\r\ntwenty-sixth special session in June, which expresses a\r\nglobal commitment to battling this epidemic at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. It is our\r\nhope that this international commitment will find\r\nexpression in technical and financial support on the\r\npart of the United Nations system.\r\nThe importance, too, of this year’s review of the\r\nimplementation of the Habitat Agenda should not be\r\noverlooked. For in this new urban millennium, in\r\nwhich more than half of the people of the world will\r\nlive in large cities, urbanization will present formidable\r\nchallenges for sustainable human development.\r\nIncreasing urban poverty, particularly in developing\r\ncountries, has resulted in exponential growth of\r\nsquatter settlements, taxing physical and social\r\ninfrastructure, with serious attendant environmental\r\nproblems. Indeed, to achieve effective human\r\nsettlement is to address integrally the urban issues of\r\npoverty, homelessness, unemployment and the\r\nmarginalization of the most vulnerable groups in our\r\nsocieties.\r\nLet us therefore use the momentum of Istanbul+5\r\nto renew our commitment to improving the state of our\r\nhuman settlements; to ensuring adequate shelter for our\r\npoor; and to promoting urban development and\r\nrenewal. In this effort we encourage a participatory\r\napproach, with Governments working in partnership\r\nwith all local stakeholders, the private sector and\r\ncommunity groups.\r\nJamaica remains deeply concerned at the\r\nalarming spread of the illicit arms trade, which\r\ncontributes to the escalation and perpetuation of\r\nviolence in the communities of Member States,\r\nundermining human rights and increasing the threat to\r\nboth personal security and the stability of society. We\r\ntherefore welcomed the Programme of Action adopted\r\nby the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade\r\nin Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. It\r\nrepresents an important first step on the part of all\r\nMember States towards embracing a meaningful\r\nstrategy to combat the illegal trade in small arms at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nThe open debate on small arms convened by the\r\nSecurity Council in August also acknowledged the\r\nproliferation of small arms as a critical factor\r\nundermining the efforts of the international community\r\nto maintain international peace and security. The\r\nindiscriminate use of these weapons in conflict and\r\npost-conflict areas has contributed to the breakdown of\r\npeace agreements and to the frustration of\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building efforts. The readiness\r\nof the Security Council to consider taking integrally\r\ninto account the impact of the proliferation of small\r\narms on its work is, in our view, a very promising sign,\r\nand one that is long overdue. We believe that the time\r\nhas come for all of the organs of the United Nations\r\nsystem to pursue a more comprehensive and\r\ncoordinated strategy, so as to fashion an effective\r\nresponse to what has increasingly become a complex\r\nchallenge to disarmament, development, democracy\r\nand human security.\r\nConsideration of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization should not be\r\nconsidered complete without an assessment of the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to implement the\r\nmandates of the General Assembly. That there has been\r\nno budgetary growth for the past four bienniums has\r\ndisturbing implications for the ability of the\r\nOrganization to respond to new mandates and emerging\r\nissues. As the Secretary-General has reminded us, we\r\nmust prepare for the possibilities of the future and meet\r\nthe new demands made on the United Nations. The\r\ncontinued recourse to borrowing from the\r\npeacekeeping accounts because of the shortfalls in the\r\npayments of contributions by Member States is\r\ntherefore disconcerting.\r\nOur collective goal must be to ensure that the\r\nOrganization is well placed to discharge its\r\nresponsibilities effectively. The dictates of the present\r\nglobal environment demand it.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nFirst, we wish to thank the Secretary-General, Kofi\r\nAnnan, for the report contained in document A/56/1.\r\nWe consider it to be a very thorough and lucid account\r\nof the wide range of activities conducted by the United\r\nNations during the last year. We feel perhaps that the\r\nreport lacks a connecting idea, which some of the\r\nprevious reports had. However, we recognize that the\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nyear covered by the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly was an exceptional period, marked at its\r\noutset by the historic Millennium Summit and, over the\r\nyear’s course, by several important events, including\r\nthe extremely smooth and well-deserved re-election of\r\nthe Secretary-General to a second term.\r\nNobody could have imagined that the year would\r\nend with an event that has shaken us all, occurring, as\r\nthe Secretary-General himself reminded us in the\r\naddendum of 14 September, just 24 hours after the\r\npublication of the report. The terrorist acts of 11\r\nSeptember, to which the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council reacted immediately, will surely have\r\nimplications of primary importance for our daily lives,\r\non international relations and on the United Nations.\r\nWe will begin the examination of the subject on 1\r\nOctober. For that reason, I will refrain from speaking\r\non this subject until that occasion, though it is on all of\r\nour minds and is the backdrop to the discussions of\r\nthese days.\r\nHowever, the situation we face does allow us to\r\nunderline, still more than ever, the indispensable nature\r\nof the United Nations, or, as the Secretary General put\r\nit, “its enduring significance” as the only universal\r\norganism at our disposal for collectively dealing with\r\nthe common challenges we face. We are concerned that\r\nthis so very fundamental idea is questioned in many\r\ncircles, as became clear, for example, from the\r\nreactions encountered at, and even the confrontations\r\narising in, the recent World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance. We therefore wish to reaffirm that\r\ntoday we need the United Nations more than ever. The\r\nrange of issues covered in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, combined with recent events that have\r\naffected us deeply, are the most eloquent confirmation\r\nof that.\r\nThere is much in the report to commented on and\r\nso little time to do so. As a result, I would just like to\r\nsignal a few aspects of the report of particular interest\r\nto my country.\r\nFirst, the extraordinary contribution that peace\r\noperations have made in keeping and building peace in\r\nseveral regions in the world, particularly in Africa. For\r\nour part, we fully appreciate the presence of the United\r\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala, and we\r\ntake due note of and agree with the statement by the\r\nSecretary-General contained in paragraph 65 of the\r\nreport.\r\nSecondly, we also applaud the extensive work of\r\nthe Organization in the area of humanitarian aid. My\r\ncountry has witnessed the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations in dealing with natural disasters, which,\r\nunfortunately, have afflicted my region\r\ndisproportionately in recent years.\r\n.Thirdly, we believe that one of the most\r\nimportant achievements of last year was the holding of\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly on\r\nHIV/AIDS and the Declaration of Commitment\r\napproved there. The implementation of the agreement\r\nwill impact on public awareness and will undoubtedly\r\nhelp to deal with the effects of the pandemic and of\r\nrelated diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria.\r\nFourthly, in our ongoing effort to contribute to\r\ndisarmament, we regret that the results of the\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects have fallen short of\r\nour expectations.\r\nFifthly, we agree with the Secretary-General on\r\nthe importance of fully implementing the\r\nrecommendations of the United Nations Panel on Peace\r\nOperations and on the importance of considering the\r\nproposals before us to strengthen the peacekeeping\r\ncapacity of the United Nations.\r\nSixthly, we stress the importance of the work of\r\nthe Organization for fomenting cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, we believe that one of the\r\nactivities of greatest relevance and potential at our\r\ndisposal is the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development, to be held in Monterrey, Mexico,\r\nnext March. In this connection, I would also like to\r\nmention the Rio+10 summit to be held in\r\nJohannesburg.\r\nSeventhly, we believe that the report, in chapter\r\nIII, underestimates the contribution and potential of the\r\nregional commissions towards the work of the\r\nOrganization. Notable in this context is the report’s\r\nvirtual omission of the activities of the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nEighthly, we share the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to make ourselves more open to our respective\r\ncivil societies. In this regard, we support the more\r\nactive participation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in\r\nour deliberations.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nNinthly, having had the privilege of presiding\r\nover the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly\r\nduring its fifty-fifth session, we wish to ratify the\r\nelementary principle that all Member States must pay\r\ntheir dues on time, in full and without conditions\r\nattached. We feel too that the time has come to\r\nabandon the zero-growth policy in the budget for the\r\nbiennium 2002-2003 if the Organization is to fully\r\nmeet its obligations.\r\nFinally, in spite of the events of 11 September, we\r\nbelieve that a long-term vision for the work of the\r\nOrganization is appropriately set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. We look forward eagerly to action on the\r\nSecretary-General’s plan for the full implementation of\r\nthe various elements of that Declaration.\r\nMr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I wish\r\nat the outset to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his report to the General Assembly on the\r\nwork of the Organization, document A/56/1. That\r\ncomprehensive and complete report outlines the\r\nchallenges facing the United Nations in its quest for\r\npeace, security and development. It thus helps advance\r\nour discussion about possible approaches to future\r\ncollective action by the international community. The\r\nSecretary-General’s contribution should form a basis\r\nupon which we can unite our efforts to strengthen the\r\nwork of the Organization.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\npursuit of international peace and progress requires the\r\nsustained commitment and engagement of the\r\ncommunity of nations, but our task today is to work to\r\nmake a reality of the principles of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which aroused such high hopes and which\r\ncalls upon us to set the priorities of an international\r\ncommunity which expects greater justice, progress and\r\nfreedom.\r\nIn the chapter entitled “Achieving peace and\r\nsecurity” — two key spheres of United Nations\r\nactivity — priority is given to the prevention of armed\r\nconflict. It is indeed time to make prevention central to\r\ninternational efforts towards peace and development.\r\nWe must promote a true culture of prevention. In that\r\ncontext, we welcome last June’s report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the prevention of armed conflict\r\n(A/55/985-S/2001/574 and Corr.1). As members are\r\naware, Tunisia is strongly committed to the United\r\nNations so that the international community can catch\r\ndisputes before they descend into open conflict.\r\nAmong that report’s recommendations are some\r\nthat the Secretary-General reiterates in the report\r\nbefore us today, notably on an integrated strategy to\r\nstrengthen the capacity of United Nations bodies and\r\nagencies, to include increased use of multisectoral fact-\r\nfinding missions and confidence-building measures in\r\nvolatile regions.\r\nHere, with respect to paragraph 19, I want to\r\nstress that we agree that a well-planned and\r\ncoordinated peace-building strategy can play a\r\nsignificant role in conflict prevention. That approach\r\nhas the further advantage of saving human lives — not\r\nto mention the budgetary resources of the Organization.\r\nBefore moving on from the chapter on peace and\r\nsecurity, I want to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\noverview of developments in various areas of tension\r\nthroughout the world where the United Nations is\r\npresent in one way or another. I want also to say that at\r\na time when there has been progress in the situation in\r\nsome of those areas, it is frustrating to note that in the\r\nMiddle East there has been a serious deterioration in\r\nthe situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. The\r\npeace process remains blocked, and the Mitchell report\r\ncannot even be implemented owing to the policies and\r\npractices of the Tel Aviv Government. While our\r\nappreciation goes to our wise Secretary-General for his\r\nefforts to help resolve the crisis, we stress the need for\r\naction by the international community towards\r\nresuming negotiations between the parties. We also\r\nreaffirm the urgent need for a comprehensive, just and\r\nlasting solution of the Middle East conflict on the basis\r\nof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973) and on the basis of the principle of land for\r\npeace.\r\nTurning to development — which is synonymous\r\nwith peace — we note with interest the chapter entitled\r\n“Cooperation for development”. We agree with the\r\nSecretary-General’s analysis of the international\r\nsituation and the prospects for collective action in this\r\nsphere. As the Secretary-General observes, the United\r\nNations continues to dedicate substantial resources to\r\nsupporting Governments in the implementation of their\r\ndevelopment objectives and priorities. The United\r\nNations is more than an essential forum; it is an\r\nirreplaceable tool for stimulating and catalysing\r\ninternational cooperation for development.\r\nThere are so many challenges, such as: the\r\nextreme poverty and destitution that are widespread\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nthroughout the world; underdevelopment; appalling\r\ninequality; devastating pandemics; environmental\r\ndegradation; the digital divide; and many others. The\r\nsituation is such that, in this era of globalization, we\r\nwonder, along with some economists, whether it would\r\nbe better for many, many countries first of all to be\r\nintegrated into the international economy. Is it not time\r\nfor the international community, at the dawn of the new\r\ncentury, to redouble its efforts and accelerate the many\r\nkinds of cooperation to meet all these challenges, with\r\nrespect for human dignity, equality and equity, as\r\nadvocated by world leaders in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration?\r\nAs the Secretary-General notes, there are many\r\nways for the international community of nations to act.\r\nThese include the mobilization of resources for\r\ndevelopment and for poverty eradication; the creation\r\nof new opportunities for the poorest and least\r\ndeveloped nations; the promotion of social\r\ndevelopment and of sustainable development; and other\r\nkinds of action as well. In due course, my country will\r\nreaffirm its proposals on this subject.\r\nWe endorse the Secretary-General’s analysis in\r\nparagraphs 138 and 139 of the report, which rightly\r\nhighlights the intrinsic link between the crucial areas of\r\nfinancing, trade and development. Hence the urgent\r\nneed for robust action to find satisfactory solutions to\r\nthe problems of indebtedness of the developing\r\ncountries and the access of their commodities to the\r\nmarkets of the developed countries; hence, too, the\r\nimportance of significantly increasing foreign direct\r\ninvestment and of reversing the downward trend of\r\nofficial development assistance so that we may again\r\nprogress towards achieving the goal of 0.7 per cent of\r\nthe gross national product of the developing countries.\r\nIn this context, the upcoming International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nfrom 18 to 22 March 2002 in Monterrey, Mexico, is of\r\nvery special importance. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s decision to establish a High-Level Panel On\r\nFinancing For Development to draft a report to assist\r\nGovernments in fine-tuning their proposals for the\r\nMonterrey Conference. The Summit scheduled to be\r\nheld in South Africa in 2002 will give the international\r\ncommunity another opportunity to reinvigorate its\r\ncommitment to sustainable development.\r\nMaking globalization a positive force for all\r\nmankind is the major challenge before us today,\r\naccording to the Millennium Declaration. The fruits of\r\nglobalization cannot benefit everyone unless we find\r\nappropriate responses to the structural problems of the\r\ndeveloping countries. On this will depend the balance\r\nof societies in the world that we wish to build for the\r\nfuture, for the current and coming generations — a\r\nworld that must be just and equitable and in which the\r\nvalues of liberty, equality and solidarity will ultimately\r\nfind full expression.\r\nTo that end, the ever-renewed commitment and\r\nresolve of nations are desirable — indeed, necessary —\r\nin building tomorrow’s world, rekindling hope and\r\nrepulsing such threats as poverty and destitution.\r\nHuman dignity is one and indivisible. It is therefore\r\nentirely appropriate that the Secretary-General, at the\r\nvery beginning of his report, stresses the importance of\r\nthe ongoing commitment of the community of nations.\r\nAfrica requires special attention, as called for in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. It has made enormous\r\nsacrifices to carry out the necessary structural,\r\npolitical, economic and social reforms. It has clearly\r\ndemonstrated its determination to take charge of its\r\ndestiny, as the Secretary-General recalls. Nonetheless,\r\nthe many challenges facing the continent are thwarting\r\nits efforts, inescapably requiring a substantial\r\ncontribution from the international community. The\r\nUnited Nations is the forum towards which Africa\r\nnaturally turns. I wish to reiterate here our appeal for\r\nincreased mobilization on the part of the international\r\ncommunity on behalf of Africa, its peoples and their\r\nhuman rights, including their right to development and\r\nprosperity.\r\nIn the chapter on the international legal order, the\r\nSecretary-General stresses important developments in a\r\nnumber of issues related to the consolidation of the rule\r\nof law. Terrorism is one of those issues. The\r\nhorrendous terrorist attacks perpetrated on 11\r\nSeptember against facilities in the United States of\r\nAmerica shed a drear light on the question of\r\ninternational terrorism and prompt a number of\r\nquestions of crucial importance, among which: What\r\nshould we do to protect ourselves against this\r\ndevastating scourge? While we wait for a response to\r\nemerge from the necessary discussion, one thing is\r\nsure: the international community cannot afford to\r\ncontinue to address this question as it has done\r\nheretofore. We must acquire the means to defend\r\nourselves against this scourge. On 1 October, we will\r\nreturn to this idea in the debate on this subject.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nIn conclusion, I take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nto Mr. Kofi Annan our heartfelt congratulations on his\r\nunanimous election to a second term of office as\r\nSecretary-General. We wish him every success in his\r\ntask, which is enormous but within his capacities to\r\ntackle.\r\nMr. Mbanefo (Nigeria): I would like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election and,\r\nthrough him, his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for a\r\nvery successful fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I wish to assure the President and members\r\nof the Bureau of the cooperation and support of my\r\ndelegation towards the successful completion of this\r\nsession under his presidency.\r\nMy delegation congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his re-election and\r\nexpresses its profound appreciation for his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization. The report discusses\r\nclearly some of the most pressing issues currently\r\nconfronting humanity, such as violent conflicts,\r\ninternational terrorism, human rights abuses,\r\ndeplorable humanitarian conditions, increased numbers\r\nof refugees and internally displaced persons, the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and the problems of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe issue of conflicts and the achievement of\r\nglobal peace and security remains one of the greatest\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. While my\r\ndelegation recognizes the fact that the United Nations,\r\nthrough the Security Council, has the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, a successful conflict prevention\r\nstrategy will require the cooperation of all.\r\nMy delegation therefore commends the efforts of\r\nthe Secretary-General in his use of the tools of quiet\r\ndiplomacy, such as fact-finding and confidence-\r\nbuilding missions, an informal network of eminent\r\npersons, mediation, conciliation and arbitration, in the\r\nsearch for peace. We support the recommendation in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on the use of\r\ninterdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building\r\nmissions to volatile regions and particularly commend\r\nthe recent mission dispatched to West Africa, the\r\nCentral African Republic and the Democratic Republic\r\nof Congo.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration called for enhanced\r\ninstitutional cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional and subregional organizations in the\r\nsearch for the peaceful resolution of conflicts. We are\r\ndelighted to note the success of such an approach, as\r\ndemonstrated in West Africa, where the United\r\nNations, in active collaboration with the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\r\nMano River Union countries, participated in addressing\r\ncomplex humanitarian, political and security situations\r\naffecting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The United\r\nNations continues to support ECOWAS initiatives in\r\nthe promotion of dialogue among the three countries in\r\nthe belief that, without such dialogue, efforts to address\r\nthe root causes of the subregion’s problems will remain\r\nineffective.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation therefore welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation to develop\r\nregional strategies that will include regional actors in\r\nfinding solutions to conflicts. I appeal for financial and\r\nlogistical assistance to such regional and subregional\r\norganizations in order to enhance their effectiveness.\r\nFurthermore, considering the importance of an\r\neffective Secretariat to the overall success of conflict\r\nprevention, we request that the necessary funds be\r\nmade available to the Secretary-General on request to\r\nenable the Secretariat cope effectively with the\r\ncomplexities of today’s conflicts.\r\nNigeria is deeply concerned about acts of\r\ninternational terrorism, of which we have all been\r\nvictims recently. It will be recalled that our delegation\r\nparticipated in the preparation of the General Assembly\r\nDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate International\r\nTerrorism, in 1994, and the supplementary Declaration,\r\nyears later. Nigeria is ready to cooperate with other\r\nmembers of the international community through\r\nbilateral and multilateral efforts to suppress all forms\r\nof terrorism. We condemn in the strongest terms all\r\nacts of terrorism and stress that terrorists should not be\r\nallowed political haven as asylum-seekers or granted\r\nrefugee status in any country. It is also important that\r\nwe expose those who support those terrorists under\r\nwhatever guise. Furthermore, we support current effort\r\nto adopt a convention on the suppression of acts of\r\nnuclear terrorism.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration our leaders\r\nresolved to eliminate weapons of mass destruction,\r\nparticularly nuclear weapons, and to reduce the global\r\nrisk posed by small arms and landmines. The continued\r\nproliferation of small arms is a source of concern for us\r\nand, indeed, for all developing countries. The\r\ninternational community should not fail to take\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\ncognizance of the correlation between instability, the\r\nproliferation of small arms and the incidence of\r\nconflict. Africa remains the most affected region,\r\nconsidering the devastation that small arms-aided\r\nconflicts have wreaked on communities, societies and\r\nStates. It is against this background that we welcome\r\nthe objectives of the recently concluded United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects. We urge the\r\ninternational community to take concrete steps to\r\nensure effective control of the circulation of small\r\narms.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose\r\nserious challenges to our developmental efforts. We\r\nappreciate the efforts of the United Nations and the\r\ncontributions of the international community in\r\ncombating the HIV/AIDS scourge, particularly in\r\nAfrica. We endorse the call made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral during the twenty sixth special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, on HIV/AIDS, for a new global\r\ncampaign in the fight against HIV/AIDS. We also\r\nendorse the Plan of Action adopted at the special\r\nsummit of the Organization of African Unity on AIDS,\r\nwhich was intended to translate into concrete initiatives\r\nthe commitments made by African leaders to intensify\r\ntheir efforts and mobilize resources for the prevention,\r\ncare and treatment of the disease. We further endorse\r\nthe proposal by the Secretary-General for the\r\nestablishment of a Global AIDS and Health Fund in\r\norder to mobilize the funds necessary to address the\r\nAIDS epidemic.\r\nOne of the greatest scourges confronting mankind\r\ntoday is poverty. A situation where more than half of\r\nthe world’s population lives on less than $2 per day is\r\nnot only totally unacceptable. It is also an indictment\r\non humanity and globalization. While globalization has\r\nrapidly integrated countries through trade, investment\r\nflows and information and communications\r\ntechnologies in our era of a knowledge-based global\r\neconomy, it is vital that its benefits should no longer be\r\nconfined to the prosperity of a few developed countries\r\nand peoples. The increasing level of poverty in\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, remains a\r\nburden on the resources available to those countries for\r\ndevelopment. That is why Nigeria welcomes the\r\ndecision of world leaders to wage a war on poverty by\r\nlaunching a sustained campaign to make the right to\r\ndevelopment a reality. African leaders have established\r\na new initiative based on a common vision and shared\r\nconviction that we have a pressing duty to eradicate\r\npoverty and to put our countries on the path of\r\nsustainable socio-economic growth and development.\r\nWe therefore look forward to the support and enabling\r\npartnership of the international community for the\r\nsuccess of the New African Initiative.\r\nI cannot conclude this statement without making\r\nreference to the issue of human rights. Bridging the gap\r\nbetween human rights norms and their implementation\r\ncontinues to pose a substantial challenge for our\r\nOrganization. My delegation therefore endorses the call\r\nby the Secretary-General for Member States to ratify\r\nthe six core United Nations human rights treaties and\r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court. We also\r\nsupport the need to strengthen the International Court\r\nof Justice as a vital organ in the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation is pleased to note\r\nthat commendable efforts have been made by the\r\nSecretary-General to implement reforms aimed at\r\nstrengthening the effectiveness of the Organization. In\r\ngeneral, we are satisfied with the various initiatives\r\nbeing undertaken by the Secretary-General. We pledge\r\nour continued cooperation in the efforts to strengthen\r\nour Organization.\r\nMr. Petrič (Slovenia): Allow me to congratulate\r\nPresident Han Seung-soo on his assumption of the\r\npresidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. He and the Bureau have the full confidence\r\nand support of my country in carrying out their\r\nimportant tasks.\r\nI would also like to thank Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan for yet another comprehensive and concise\r\nannual report on the work of the Organization. We are\r\ninspired by his resolution to bring the United Nations\r\ncloser to all people and to revive confidence in our\r\nglobal partnership. We are glad that his leadership,\r\nexperience, vision and humanity will continue to be\r\ndevoted to our Organization in the coming years.\r\nThe annual report makes a good presentation of\r\nour past achievements and provides a number of ideas\r\non how to conduct the activities of United Nations in\r\nthe future. Together with the road map towards the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the annual report provides us an\r\nopportunity to present our views on the issues before\r\nus and to chart the action to be taken by the United\r\nNations and the General Assembly.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nWe are still horrified by the loss of the lives of\r\nfellow New Yorkers and others caused by brutal\r\nterrorists. The United Nations has a great role to play\r\nin the fight against terrorism. Close cooperation in the\r\nsuppression of terrorism is in the interest of every\r\ncivilized nation, as terrorism is an international and\r\nglobal scourge affecting the lives of each and every one\r\nof us. We must now stand together and make sure that\r\nthe perpetrators are brought to justice, wherever they\r\nmay be. No country should be allowed to provide safe\r\nhaven for terrorists anymore. The Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly should take appropriate further\r\nsteps to make that happen. It is a difficult task and may\r\ntake some time to realize, but it fits the United Nations\r\nperfectly. The United Nations role is indeed central\r\nhere, since combating terrorism in the long run also\r\nmeans eradicating its roots — hatred, racism and\r\npoverty in particular.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity is the fundamental purpose of the United\r\nNations. Peacekeeping operations are of particular\r\nimportance. We are pleased that the Brahimi\r\nrecommendations have been well received and are\r\nsupported by the Security Council. As a way of\r\ncontributing to ensuring adequate resources for\r\npeacekeeping, Slovenia decided last year to voluntarily\r\nrelinquish the discount in the peacekeeping scale of\r\nassessments that it has enjoyed. It is encouraging that\r\nthe Secretariat is now finalizing a practical guide for\r\nHeadquarters support for the missions in the field by\r\nformulating coherent peace-building strategies. Those\r\nare, indeed, essential in conflict prevention. We are\r\nalso pleased that such strategies increasingly include\r\nprotection of civilians, in particular women and\r\nchildren.\r\nTo prevent tragedies of massive proportions such\r\nas those in Rwanda and Srebrenica, Slovenia pointed\r\nout last year the need to prepare the ground for\r\nadequate preventive action, including humanitarian\r\naction, if and when it becomes necessary. We are still\r\nof the opinion that the United Nations, and the Security\r\nCouncil in particular, should be the framework for such\r\naction. However, we should not run the risk of neglect\r\nof the problem of humanitarian action resulting in a\r\ntendency for our Organization to be bypassed when\r\nsuch action is taken.\r\nConflict prevention and human security should be\r\ncentral among the United Nations preoccupations.\r\nDuring our presidency in November 1999, Slovenia\r\ninitiated the first open session of the Security Council\r\non conflict prevention. It gives us great pleasure now to\r\nwelcome the first report (A/55/985) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on conflict prevention and the report’s tangible\r\nand comprehensive recommendations. We agree that\r\neffective conflict prevention should address the root\r\ncauses of conflicts and embrace both short- and long-\r\nterm political, economic, humanitarian and other\r\nmeasures. We consider this report an important step on\r\nthe road to establishing a working culture of\r\nprevention.\r\nThe Secretary-General in his annual report\r\npointed out that the international tribunals have made\r\nsignificant advances. We share the view that they\r\nindeed contribute to peace and justice.\r\nA large majority of States have clearly\r\ndemonstrated their will to put an end to impunity by\r\nadopting the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court. We hope that the Statute will enter into\r\nforce soon. For the first time, those responsible for the\r\nmost heinous crimes of genocide, crimes against\r\nhumanity and war crimes will be brought to justice, no\r\nmatter where the crimes have been committed. This\r\nshould most certainly improve the future conduct of\r\nboth States and individuals.\r\nThe capacity to adjust to new conditions is crucial\r\nfor the future role of the United Nations. When\r\nreforming our main organs — and we should reform\r\nthem — we should stick less to our own perceptions\r\nand try harder in the coming years to reach a consensus\r\nthat will enable our Organization to best adapt to the\r\nchanging world. It is also important that the members\r\nof the Security Council understand that the legitimacy\r\nof their decisions rests on the support of the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations, and that\r\ntransparency of the Security Council’s work can often\r\ncontribute to better compliance with its decisions.\r\nGlobalization is an ongoing and unavoidable\r\nprocess. To reap the benefits of globalization and\r\ndiminish its negative effects, we have to be able to\r\nresponsibly master this phenomenon through ever-\r\ncloser dialogue and partnerships among all sectors of\r\nour societies. The challenge of globalization does not\r\nbear only on its economic, financial and social aspects.\r\nIt brings also new challenges to the maintenance of\r\npeace and security and to the establishment of a\r\ncommon system of values. We in the United Nations\r\nbear a special responsibility to ensure that the benefits\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nof globalization be spread equitably and that the non-\r\nprivileged will not suffer its ill consequences.\r\nIn the past year there have been important\r\ninternational conferences at which the United Nations\r\naddressed some crucial contemporary questions facing\r\nthe international community. These include the General\r\nAssembly special session on HIV/AIDS, the World\r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance and the\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects. We consider that\r\nthese conferences made an important contribution and\r\nare proof of the vitality of our Organization.\r\nLet me mention also the recent Managua meeting,\r\nwhich was an important step in the framework of the\r\nOttawa Convention to eradicate anti-personnel land\r\nmines from the face of the earth. I am proud to report\r\nagain on Slovenian endeavours in this field. The\r\nInternational Trust Fund for Demining and Mine\r\nVictims Assistance, based in my capital, continues to\r\nbe the most important actor in demining in the Balkans.\r\nIn conclusion, let me point out that another world\r\nsummit for children is an initiative particularly close to\r\nthe heart of Slovenia, and we look forward to its\r\nconvening as soon as practicable. We in Slovenia\r\ntraditionally give great attention to our children and to\r\nthe activities of the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF). Slovenia decided this year to double its\r\ncontribution to UNICEF. An investment in the care of\r\nand compassion for children is an investment in\r\nenhancing the values of the civilization and human\r\nsecurity of tomorrow. Therefore, we are particularly\r\npleased that care for children is gaining ever more\r\nattention within the entire United Nations system.\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): I first congratulate the President\r\non his assumption of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session.\r\nMy delegation expresses its great appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for presenting his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express once again\r\nour deep regret over the tragic terrorist incidents that\r\noccurred in the United States on 11 September and the\r\nmany innocent lives that were lost.\r\nMy delegation has followed with close attention\r\nthe issues of international security, conflict prevention\r\nand the eradication of poverty, as dealt with in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General. We share his view that\r\nit is the major task of the United Nations to ensure\r\npeace and security for all countries in the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nAs we entered the new millennium, arguments\r\ndesigned to destroy the concept of sovereignty and\r\npromote “humanitarian intervention” presented major\r\nchallenges to the independent development of\r\nhumankind. Acts threatening and violating State\r\nsovereignty have become undisguised, and most\r\nconflicts remain unresolved because of external\r\ninterference. Where the sovereignty of States is\r\nviolated, rights to economic development — and even\r\nthe right to survival — are seriously infringed.\r\nThe Charter defines the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security as the main purpose of\r\nthe Organization and the recognition of and respect for\r\nthe sovereign equality of all Member States as its\r\nfundamental principle. This principle was reaffirmed at\r\nthe Millennium Summit last year.\r\nThe United Nations should pay particular\r\nattention to ensuring that big countries refrain from\r\nthreatening the sovereignty of small and weak\r\ncountries and from taking advantage of conflicts to\r\nachieve domination. The nuclear-weapon States should\r\ncreate the confidence necessary to realize\r\ncomprehensive and complete disarmament, by taking\r\nsuch practical measures as presenting a timetable for\r\nscrapping nuclear weapons.\r\nIn order to address the challenges facing the\r\ninternational community, the application of a double\r\nstandard should be rejected and fairness and\r\nimpartiality should be ensured in United Nations\r\nactivities. In international relations the exercise of\r\npower by big countries is tacitly accepted now, whereas\r\nthe self-defence measures of small countries are\r\nsubject to becoming targets of sanctions and pressure.\r\nIf we are to check this unfairness and the use of double\r\nstandards, the leading role of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the functions and the role of the General\r\nAssembly, should be enhanced. The General Assembly,\r\nas the highest United Nations organ, should decide on\r\nall issues related to international peace and security, so\r\nthat the other organs do not adopt any resolutions that\r\nrun counter to the will of the Member States. We\r\nconsider it necessary to take appropriate steps for the\r\nSpecial Committee on the Charter of the United\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nNations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the\r\nOrganizations to take up this issue and present\r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly.\r\nIf United Nations activities are to be\r\ndemocratized, the Security Council should be\r\nreformed. In this regard, it will be appropriate to make\r\na breakthrough in reform by, above all, reaching\r\nagreement on increasing the non-permanent\r\nmembership, a matter that can be agreed somewhat\r\neasily.\r\nA year has passed since the Co-Chairpersons of\r\nthe Millennium Summit issued their statement\r\n(A/55/PV.4) and the General Assembly unanimously\r\nadopted a resolution (55/11) supporting the historic\r\nPyongyang inter-Korean summit and the North-South\r\njoint declaration. The miraculous events that took place\r\non the Korean peninsula last year resulted from the\r\nindependent politics and the idea of great national unity\r\nof our respected General Kim Jong Il. North and South\r\nKorea have jointly presented the agenda item “Peace,\r\nsecurity and reunification on the Korean peninsula”\r\nagain this year, with a view to achieving independent\r\nand peaceful reunification, in the spirit of the North-\r\nSouth joint declaration.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express thanks\r\nto those countries that extend support and solidarity to\r\nour efforts to implement the joint declaration, free from\r\noutside interference.\r\nMs. Cedeño Reyes (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On behalf of the delegation of Venezuela, I\r\nwish to congratulate the President on his election. His\r\nproven experience and skill in exercising high-level\r\npublic responsibilities guarantee that under his\r\nleadership we will be able to move forward in dealing\r\nwith the topics on the Assembly’s agenda. He can\r\ncount on our cooperation to work constructively and\r\nflexibly in this regard.\r\nWith respect to the topic before us, I thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the timely submission of his\r\nannual report on the work of the Organization. The\r\nSecretary-General thus fulfils his responsibility to\r\nbring to the attention of the Member States the most\r\nimportant world issues and the state of this\r\nOrganization during the period under review. While\r\nrecognizing his contribution in this respect, we also\r\ncongratulate him on the sincerity of his diagnosis and\r\non the strength of convictions that supports his\r\nmanagement at the head of the United Nations.\r\nThe comments made by the Secretary-General\r\nrequire the attention of our authorities, since they are\r\nthe ones who must guide the Organization and provide\r\nit with a safe direction in the period of transition the\r\ninternational system has gone through in the past few\r\nyears. In this regard, we must join efforts to ensure that\r\nthere is no repetition in this century of tragedies such\r\nas the recent terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001,\r\nwhich my country categorically condemns. We are\r\nconvinced that the General Assembly can make an\r\nimportant contribution to this review.\r\nThe United Nations finds itself facing an\r\ninternational reality that is as promising as it is\r\nparadoxical. On the one hand, it is felt that in the\r\ncontext of growing interdependence and globalization,\r\nthe management of global matters and the search for\r\nsolutions to problems of common interest are\r\nobjectives that can only be promoted through United\r\nNations action that provides a balance of different\r\nviewpoints and articulates the interests of States.\r\nHowever, those expectations are often limited as a\r\nresult of the lack of necessary support of its members\r\nand of adaptation of its structures to the signs of these\r\nnew times.\r\nAs the Secretary-General points out, the\r\nMillennium Summit, which brought together a large\r\nnumber of heads of State and Government, made\r\npossible a renewed faith in multilateralism, particularly\r\nthe United Nations. It also spoke of the need for\r\nrelevant reforms so that, with the proper resources and\r\nbased on observance of the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter, it may respond in a timely and decisive\r\nmanner to the problems posed in the areas of peace and\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nDespite the major efforts of the Organization to\r\nresolve conflict situations in some regions of the world,\r\nwe note with concern the continuation of unusually\r\nviolent conflicts in which the civilian population has\r\nbecome a political objective of groups or factions that\r\ndefy the basic norms of international humanitarian law.\r\nConflict prevention through the eradication of the\r\nsocial and economic causes of conflict is an urgent,\r\ninescapable objective for the international community,\r\ngiven the economic and human benefits that can be\r\nrealized through such a strategy, based on agreed\r\nprinciples of international relations, such as non-\r\nintervention, respect for sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity, the peaceful resolution of conflicts and\r\nrespect for the standards of international law.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nsuccess of the United Nations in the field of prevention\r\ndepends on the support of Member States, which have\r\nthe ongoing primary responsibility for dealing with the\r\ncauses of conflict of an internal nature. We believe that\r\nwe cannot talk about the delegation of responsibilities,\r\nbut that, rather, we should guide the Organization in\r\npromoting a better practice geared towards\r\ninternational cooperation in the areas of conflict\r\nprevention and humanitarian emergencies.\r\nIn the area of disarmament and arms control, the\r\nbalance sheet has been mixed. The policies created in\r\nthe early 1990s, with the passing of multilateral\r\nagreements in this area, have been weakened due to the\r\nabsence of a sustained effort by certain countries with\r\nspecific responsibilities in this area and the\r\ndevelopment of certain events that affect the\r\nnegotiating climate.\r\nVenezuela believes that the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to convene an international conference on the\r\nreduction of nuclear dangers is a positive initiative\r\naimed at identifying ways and means to eliminate\r\nnuclear arms in the near future, as agreed at the Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nThe problem of illicit trafficking in small arms\r\nand light weapons is one of the issues that have been\r\nadded to the multilateral disarmament agenda. This\r\nphenomenon aggravates conflicts that are developing in\r\nvarious regions, threatening the security of States, as\r\nwell as the economic and social future of peoples\r\naffected by such wars.\r\nVenezuela is convinced of the need for the\r\ninternational community to adopt measures, on the\r\nbasis of international cooperation, to eliminate such\r\nillicit activity, which is supported by groups and\r\nindividuals on the fringes of the law. In this\r\nconnection, we believe that the agreements reached at\r\nthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,\r\nwhich took place in July this year, are a positive step\r\non the path towards disarmament and the prevention of\r\nconflict.\r\nGlobalization is an inexorable force in these\r\ntimes of change and far-reaching transformation. It has\r\ncreated opportunities, such as the expansion of trade\r\nand the fast-paced development of information\r\ntechnology. Even when the benefits of the process can\r\nbe clearly seen, however, it cannot be denied that they\r\nare spread unevenly, as the worsening of extreme\r\npoverty among large sectors of the global population\r\nshows. In order to redress such imbalances, the\r\ninternational community must take concerted action\r\nleading to the adoption of concrete measures to prevent\r\nmarginalization and the social exclusion of those who\r\nremain outside that process.\r\nThe Millennium Summit made it possible to\r\nreassert the objectives of the social platform as set out\r\nby the United Nations Conferences on issues such as\r\nthe environment, social development, women and\r\npopulation, which placed human beings at the centre of\r\ndevelopment. We must ensure that the objectives set\r\nout in the declarations and programmes of action are\r\ntransformed into specific actions to reduce extreme\r\npoverty by half, as agreed. Measures taken by national\r\nGovernments for the promotion of social objectives\r\nshould be supported by sustained international\r\ncooperation, in a spirit of solidarity, to ensure that\r\nefforts to this end are carried out effectively and\r\nspeedily, thereby helping to overcome deprivation,\r\nhunger and poverty.\r\nIn the context of this approach based on shared\r\nresponsibility, Venezuela believes that the convening,\r\nin March 2002 in Monterrey, of an International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, will\r\nprovide an ideal opportunity for both developing and\r\ndeveloped countries to act jointly in adopting a series\r\nof political measures to promote financial stability and\r\nreach consensus on the need to set up a new financial\r\narchitecture. My country believes that that Conference\r\nshould also consider the possibility of mobilizing\r\nnational and international resources for social\r\ndevelopment with a view to implementing the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action,\r\nadopting trade-related measures and providing debt\r\nrelief.\r\nAlthough progress has been made with regard to\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms as a result of\r\nthe consolidation and strengthening of democracy in\r\nthe world, we are concerned about the fact that signs of\r\nracism and xenophobia still persist. We had thought\r\nthat such manifestations, which run counter to human\r\nrights and undermine human dignity, were dead and\r\nburied. The recent World Conference against Racism,\r\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related\r\nIntolerance, which took place in South Africa, provided\r\na unique opportunity for the international community\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nto adopt measures in response to discrimination on the\r\nbasis of race, colour or ethnic origin.\r\nWith regard to the consolidation of an\r\ninternational order based on the validity of the norms\r\nof international law, Venezuela supported from the\r\noutset the establishment of an International Criminal\r\nCourt, and we took part in the process to establish the\r\nCourt, on the basis of principles of universality,\r\ncomplementarity and autonomy. In that spirit,\r\nconvinced of the contribution that the Court can make\r\nto the cause of peace and respect for international law,\r\nthrough the prosecution and punishment of those\r\nresponsible for international crimes, and to the\r\nprevention of impunity, in June last year the\r\nGovernment of Venezuela deposited its instrument of\r\nratification of the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court. This act reflects the priority that our\r\ncountry places on improving and ensuring the\r\ncredibility and transparency of justice in the\r\ninternational sphere. We hope that this legal instrument\r\nwill enter into force in the near future so that the Court\r\ncan be set up and begin to function.\r\nLet us put this Organization at the service of\r\npeoples by the resolute promotion of the objectives of\r\npeace and social and economic development. The\r\nobjectives agreed at the Millennium Summit by our\r\nheads of State or Government must be achieved within\r\nthe time frame that has been set out. Now is the time\r\nfor us to take action in order to give concrete form to\r\nhopes for a more equitable and just world, in which the\r\neradication of poverty and the promotion of\r\ndevelopment are a genuine expression of international\r\npeace and stability.\r\nVenezuela agrees with the Secretary-General that\r\nthe United Nations must become a vehicle for the\r\nprogress of humankind. To that end, Member States\r\nshould, through international dialogue and cooperation,\r\ndirect their efforts in order to respond to the challenges\r\nof globalization, at the same time taking advantage of\r\nthe opportunities that it provides. If it is to fully\r\nshoulder its responsibilities, the United Nations will\r\nhave to engage in constant renewal and adaptation to\r\nthe realities of the day, and it will need the support and\r\nunderstanding of its Member States.\r\nMr. Babaa (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I should like first of all to congratulate\r\nMr. Han, and his country, the Republic of Korea, on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits current session. We are sure that, thanks to his skill\r\nand wisdom, our work will be successful.\r\nThe General Assembly is beginning its work this\r\nyear in an atmosphere of sadness and unusual\r\ncircumstances because of the terrorist attacks that took\r\nplace on 11 September. My delegation would once\r\nagain like to convey its deepest sympathy and\r\ncondolences to the people of the United States and to\r\nthe families of the victims, whether in the United\r\nStates or elsewhere, and to express our solidarity with\r\nthem.\r\nMy country and my people understand better than\r\nmany others the nature of true suffering and the\r\nambiguity of feelings in the wake of such tragedies.\r\nRaids on my country in 1986, in which more than 100\r\naircraft took part and which caused a great deal of\r\ndestruction and took the lives of many innocent\r\nvictims, made us aware of such feelings. We welcome\r\nand will be taking part in the special debate on\r\nterrorism next week, during which my delegation will\r\njoin others in discussing the subject in detail.\r\nWe condemn terrorism in all of its forms and\r\nmanifestations. However, let me reiterate once again\r\nthat we believe that terrorism has become a global\r\nproblem — one that is not restricted only to certain\r\nreligions or cultures. That is a truth that everyone can\r\nunderstand: terrorist acts occur in all parts of the world.\r\nThe hatred for Islam, for Arabs, for Muslims that we\r\nsee in certain parts of the world must be condemned\r\nvehemently, just as we condemn terrorism, hatred and\r\nracism, wherever they occur.\r\nInternational terrorism has become a worldwide\r\nscourge. Accordingly, the international community\r\nmust jointly combat its heinous crimes, which target\r\ninnocent victims. Coordination and cooperation are\r\nrequired. However, dealing with this scourge requires\r\nnot only that we redouble our efforts in seeking justice,\r\nnot revenge, but also that international action be based\r\non international law and legitimacy, and that no double\r\nstandards should exist.\r\nThe international community must also draw a\r\ndistinction between terrorism directed against innocent\r\npeople and a legitimate struggle against foreign\r\ndomination and occupation. We therefore call for the\r\nconvening of an international conference to define\r\nterrorism and the means to eliminate it, after\r\ndetermining its diverse causes. That conference should\r\nbe free from political considerations. As was stated by\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nthe Secretary-General just two days ago when he\r\nintroduced his report, we should not jump to the\r\nconclusion that combating terrorism means a clash\r\nbetween civilizations, religions or cultures. As the\r\nSecretary-General said in an article that was published\r\nin The New York Times and reproduced in the\r\ninternational press, in taking steps against the\r\nperpetrators of terrorist acts, we must also deal with the\r\npolitical, economic and social conditions and causes\r\nunderlying this kind of hatred and aberration in order\r\nto restore peace, justice and security in the world.\r\nIn the weeks, months and years to come, we will\r\nneed to base ourselves on international legitimacy and\r\non the United Nations, which we have accepted as\r\nbeing the proper institutional framework for dealing\r\nwith the global scourges of armed conflict, terrorism,\r\npoverty and so on. The heads of State and Government,\r\nin adopting the Millennium Declaration, reaffirmed\r\ntheir resolve to work towards a world free of conflict,\r\nilliteracy, poverty and disease — a more just and\r\ndeveloped world. That historic document reaffirmed\r\nthe elementary principles of human dignity, justice and\r\nequality, as well as the need to resolve disputes by\r\npeaceful means, in keeping with the principles of\r\njustice and international law and the right of people\r\nunder occupation to self-determination.\r\nThe international community must therefore\r\nreaffirm those principles and enhance the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations to discharge the tasks incumbent\r\nupon it in this ever-changing international situation.\r\nWe also agree with the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that, in this globalized world, cooperation and\r\npartnerships are key and that we must share tasks and\r\nresponsibilities — between nations, Governments and\r\nregional and international organizations — so that we\r\ncan benefit from globalization while averting its\r\nnegative effects.\r\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General on his\r\nelection to a new term of office. We applaud his\r\nenthusiasm and his efforts as well as his initiatives and\r\ndedication in trying to strengthen the United\r\nNations — this Organization that is so necessary for\r\ndealing with the challenges of the international village\r\nin which we all live.\r\nIn the context of our efforts to prevent armed\r\nconflicts and deal with their underlying causes; provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance for the more vulnerable sectors\r\nof society; encourage international cooperation; protect\r\ndisadvantaged peoples and strengthen international\r\njustice and legality, attempts are being made to\r\nmarginalize this lofty Organization, whose founding\r\nfathers, more than half a century ago, were determined\r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar. We are also seeing attempts to prevent the\r\nSecurity Council from discharging its task — that is,\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nFor instance, we have seen the Security Council\r\nparalysed in recent weeks because one permanent\r\nmember was threatening to use its veto during the\r\ndiscussion of a chronic problem. As a result, the\r\nsituation in the region under consideration deteriorated,\r\nleading to a greater loss of human life than would have\r\noccurred otherwise.\r\nWe need to accelerate the reform of the United\r\nNations, particularly that of the Security Council. We\r\nshould increase the Council’s membership so that it can\r\ndischarge its mandate without being held hostage to the\r\ndomination of one Member State.\r\nWe endorse the view of the Secretary-General,\r\nexpressed in his report, regarding the deterioration of\r\nthe situation in the Arab countries and the need to find\r\na just, lasting and comprehensive solution to the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict on the basis of the relevant decisions\r\ntaken by the United Nations. The spiral of violence in\r\nthe Arab region is the result of the Zionist military\r\noccupation of Palestinian land for more than 34 years.\r\nThe occupying forces have attempted to expropriate\r\nmore land and expand existing settlements; to destroy\r\nPalestinian infrastructure; to humiliate and subjugate\r\nthe people; to impose collective sanctions on them; to\r\nuproot trees; and to assassinate Palestinian symbols of\r\nlegitimate resistance.\r\nThe debate on sanctions and their effectiveness\r\nmust continue. As the Secretary-General says,\r\nsanctions have untold humanitarian consequences. We\r\nare opposed to their imposition, and we call for the use\r\nof peaceful means and constructive dialogue in\r\nresolving disputes. As stated in the Charter, sanctions\r\nmust be the last resort after other measures have been\r\nattempted.\r\nThe political objectives of one State must not\r\nprevail over those of others. Sanctions must be lifted as\r\nsoon as the reasons for their imposition cease to exist,\r\nand no pretexts must be used to maintain them. Our\r\ncountry, for example, has suffered from unjust\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nsanctions, and, as all are aware, all segments of the\r\nLibyan population have been affected by them as well.\r\nAlthough our country has discharged all its\r\nobligations pursuant to the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, sanctions have not yet been totally lifted.\r\nThe Security Council must restore its credibility by\r\ntruly seeking to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity pursuant to the Charter; it must not be the\r\npolitical tool of the strongest countries.\r\nWe welcome the study of the political and\r\ndevelopment problems of Africa through the\r\nelaboration of a strategy to treat the real reasons for\r\nconflict, in the context of cooperation with the regional\r\nand subregional organizations. We also welcome\r\nUnited Nations initiatives to give priority to the\r\ndevelopment issues of Africa. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration required the United Nations to be a catalyst\r\nin mustering resources for the development of all the\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe welcome the fact that last July at its high-\r\nlevel segment, the Economic and Social Council\r\nendorsed the New African Initiative, adopted at the\r\nLusaka summit. We welcome the creation of the new\r\nAfrican Union in Lusaka and the declaration by\r\nAfrican States reaffirming their commitment to fighting\r\nfor sustainable development and to overcoming the\r\npresent challenges. We hope that, following these\r\ninitiatives, the General Assembly can take the\r\nnecessary decisions to resolve African problems,\r\nalleviate poverty, relieve debt, deal with diseases such\r\nas AIDS and malaria, and develop human and other\r\nresources.\r\nFinally, I should like to stress that in our twenty-\r\nfirst century, the world has become a small global\r\nvillage. Every part of the world suffers the\r\nconsequences, positive or negative, of whatever\r\nhappens elsewhere. We cannot live separate from each\r\nother. Any pressure, any injustice, any social or\r\neconomic problem, any disease has repercussions\r\nthroughout the world. Therefore, international political\r\nwill and international resources must be pooled to\r\nextinguish these small fires so that they do not develop\r\ninto a huge conflagration. Poverty and hunger must be\r\ndealt with and overcome. The resources directed to\r\ndeveloping lethal weapons must be employed to restore\r\npeace, security and justice and a better world in this\r\nnew millennium.\r\nMr. Lancry (Israel): At the outset, I would like\r\nonce again to express my deepest condolences to the\r\npeople of the United States and to all those affected by\r\nthe devastating terrorist attacks of 11 September. The\r\nGovernment and the people of Israel, like people all\r\nover the world, were shocked and horrified by these\r\ntragic events. This is a day that will always live on in\r\nour memories, and these memories, to a great extent,\r\nmust guide our deliberations over the course of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nAllow me to congratulate the Secretary-General\r\non his annual report on the work of the Organization.\r\nThe report clearly describes the challenges facing the\r\ninternational community in our ever-changing world\r\nand outlines the ways in which the Organization can\r\ncontinue to act for the betterment of humanity, based\r\non a commitment to the principles of the Charter.\r\nThe report correctly focuses on the overriding\r\ntheme of globalization and the increased\r\ninterconnectedness and interdependence of our world.\r\nIt reflects the recognition that globalization not only\r\naffords new opportunities but carries with it new\r\nthreats and new challenges as well. Neither the\r\nproblems nor the potential of globalization can be\r\naddressed by one nation alone, but, rather, require\r\ncooperation among States and international\r\norganizations. The United Nations has the potential to\r\nserve as the primary forum in which the necessary\r\npartnerships can be created to address the challenges\r\nthat confront all of humanity.\r\nAs was horrifyingly demonstrated less than two\r\nweeks ago in New York and Washington, D.C., the\r\nworld faces a grave threat from international terrorism.\r\nIt must now be clear that terrorism is not confined to a\r\nparticular region or a particular conflict. The forces\r\nthat have brought the world’s information,\r\ntransportation and financial networks closer together\r\nhave also brought the threat of terrorism to everyone’s\r\ndoorstep. This is a threat unlike any the world has ever\r\nseen before, and it has the potential to undermine our\r\nway of life and the survival of freedom and liberty. The\r\ninternational community must mobilize now to\r\nconfront this threat, to contain it and, ultimately, to\r\neradicate it.\r\nIn this regard, the United Nations has a crucial\r\nrole to play. Terrorism cannot survive for long without\r\nthe support of States and leaders in different parts of\r\nthe world who have vowed to inspire, and even\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nepitomize, the terrorist creed. Terrorists require safe\r\nhavens in which to escape the rule of law; they require\r\nterritories in which they can train; and they require\r\nfinancial assistance to fund their operations. These\r\nthree elements can be provided only by States that\r\neither directly support or turn a blind eye to the actions\r\nof terrorist groups.\r\nThe international community must take the lead\r\nin declaring that such behaviour will no longer be\r\ntolerated. States that refuse to suppress terrorists that\r\noperate in their territory must not be regarded as\r\nmembers in good standing of the family of nations.\r\nThose States must be further prevented from assuming\r\nleadership roles in international organizations. The\r\nUnited Nations must persevere in the creation of\r\nmechanisms with which to identify and take action\r\nagainst States that lend their support to terrorism.\r\nIndeed, no challenge is more pressing or more requires\r\nconcerted international cooperation than the threat of\r\nterrorism, and no action more urgently needs our\r\nattention.\r\nBut the threat of terrorism emerging from certain\r\nregions of the world, while a matter of utmost urgency,\r\nis far from the only issue with global repercussions.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a catastrophe of global\r\nproportions. It is destroying the social and economic\r\nlife of the most affected countries, but is by no means\r\nlimited to those particular countries. While sub-\r\nSaharan Africa is the region most severely afflicted,\r\nthe virus is also spreading at an alarming rate in other\r\nparts of the world. As the nature and consequences of\r\nthe problem are global in scope, so must our response\r\nbe global. All nations, Governments, international\r\norganizations, the private sector and individuals must\r\nresolve to unite in a comprehensive worldwide effort to\r\nhalt the spread of AIDS and to care for those already\r\nsuffering from it.\r\nIn that connection, Israel welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s global call to action as well as the\r\nestablishment of a High-level Inter-Agency Task Force\r\non HIV/AIDS to coordinate the response of the United\r\nNations to this crisis. We further support the\r\nestablishment of a Global AIDS and Health Fund to\r\ncombat AIDS, which will position the United Nations\r\nto lead the worldwide effort against the spread of the\r\ndisease.\r\nIsrael strongly supports the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative to move the Organization from a culture of\r\nreaction to one of conflict prevention. Focusing on\r\npreventing conflicts is not simply an exercise in the\r\nmore efficient allocation of resources — which it most\r\ncertainly is; it also represents a far more effective\r\nmethod of ridding humanity of the scourge of violence\r\nand conflict.\r\nAs was made clear in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on prevention of armed conflict (A/55/985),\r\nprimary responsibility for conflict prevention rests with\r\nnational Governments. The main role of the United\r\nNations should be to support the efforts already under\r\nway at the national level. Parties must be encouraged to\r\nsettle disputes through peaceful means, rather than\r\nthrough violence, in accordance with Article 33 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nTo that end, we support the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts to foster development and humanitarian projects\r\nin troublesome regions, to promote partnerships\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\r\nand civil society, and to send multidisciplinary\r\nmissions to areas of tension before situations spiral out\r\nof control.\r\nTo increase the effectiveness of such endeavours,\r\nthe report also deals with modifications of practices\r\nwithin the United Nations system itself. Clearly, a more\r\nefficient use of resources, a greater focus on harnessing\r\nthe power of information technology, and increasing\r\naccountability and oversight are all welcome\r\ninitiatives. In particular, in an organization as vast and\r\ndiverse as the United Nations, special attention must be\r\ndirected to facilitating improved communications\r\namong departments and agencies, and among United\r\nNations personnel in distant parts of the world. Proper\r\nfunctioning within the United Nations system will\r\nvastly improve the ability of the Organization to fulfil\r\nits mandate around the globe.\r\nGlobalization presents a host of new challenges\r\nand new opportunities. The emergence of powerful new\r\ntools for communications, for finance and for trade\r\nhave brought the diverse peoples of the world closer\r\ntogether, provided extraordinary new economic\r\nopportunities, and offered the least developed nations a\r\npathway out of poverty. But there are other vicissitudes\r\nas well. Globalization can serve to exacerbate\r\ninequities, to deepen adverse impact of the digital\r\ndivide and to benefit some at the expense of others. We\r\nmust ensure that globalization serves the common\r\ngood, that it uplifts nations and peoples, and that the\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nincreased openness and freedom of our societies does\r\nnot become the seed of our destruction. In short, we\r\nmust work together, both within the United Nations and\r\nwithout, to meet the demands of this new world.\r\nIsrael is gratified that the recognition of the\r\nnecessity of international cooperation is continually\r\nreinforced throughout the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nJust as steps are taken to streamline and improve\r\nmanagement within the United Nations system, so must\r\nwe work to improve our collective management of the\r\nforces that are reshaping the world. Only by working\r\ntogether can we ensure that globalization conforms to\r\nthe highest aspirations of humankind.\r\nThat is an objective that is far more achievable\r\nthan it may appear. Globalization is an opportunity to\r\nbring diverse peoples together and to foster an\r\nappreciation of our differences and a respect for our\r\ncommon values. It is those values that must be\r\nstrengthened in all our endeavours, as they form the\r\nbasis of our quest to rid mankind of the scourge of war\r\nand to foster peace and coexistence among all the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nIsrael remains committed to the United Nations,\r\nto the principles upon which it was founded and to its\r\nbroad agenda in all the varied areas of human\r\nendeavour. We are eager to engage in productive\r\npartnerships, to foster greater cooperation among\r\nMember States and to do our part to realize the noble\r\nobjectives for which the Organization was established.\r\nMr. Ouch (Cambodia): At the outset, allow me to\r\nexpress my sincere congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo on his unanimous election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. We are\r\nconfident that under his able guidance the work of this\r\nsession will be a landmark on the new international\r\nscene in terms of facing the new challenges for peace,\r\ndemocracy and progress.\r\nI would take to take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nthe profound condolences and deepest sympathy which\r\nthe Royal Government of Cambodia has conveyed to\r\nour host country, the United States of America. My\r\ndelegation condemns strongly those criminal acts of\r\nterrorism and supports the inclusion of item 166,\r\nentitled “Measures to eliminate international\r\nterrorism”, on the Assembly’s agenda at this session. It\r\nis anticipated that this issue will be a great challenge in\r\nour debate next week.\r\nI would like to join other speakers in thanking the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization contained in document A/56/1. The report\r\ngives a concise overview of the activities of the United\r\nNations in the areas of peace and security,\r\nhumanitarian assistance, development, international\r\nlaw, human rights and the reform of the Organization.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report makes reference\r\nto the Millennium Declaration, whose main thrust is\r\nthe war against poverty, which should be all-pervasive\r\nand all-encompassing. For developing countries, in\r\nparticular the least developed countries such as\r\nCambodia, one of the main challenges in that war is\r\nhow to deal with the irreversible process of\r\nglobalization. The crucial problem is how we can make\r\nglobalization work to our advantage and how we can\r\nintegrate our countries into the ever-accelerating\r\nprocess of globalization so that we will not be left\r\nbehind and continue to be marginalized. The process of\r\nglobalization, driven by advances in information and\r\ncommunications technology, the increased mobility of\r\ncapital, reductions in the barriers of trade and the cost\r\nof international transactions, is an unprecedented\r\nreality, leaving no country immune or able to escape its\r\nimpact.\r\nIt is clear for all to see that the impact of\r\nglobalization benefits primarily the States that already\r\nhave a strong grip on their economies, while leaving\r\nthe least developed countries, such as Cambodia, with\r\nfew resources, if any, and little assistance to cope with\r\nsuch a crisis. In the end, the rich countries are getting\r\nricher and the poor countries are getting poorer.\r\nTherefore, my delegation is of the view that all\r\ncountries of the world should unite their efforts and\r\nresources to make sure that the benefits of\r\nglobalization are spread more equally among the\r\ninternational community and to minimize the negative\r\nimpact of this phenomenon, enabling least developed\r\ncountries to continuously develop and provide the\r\nnecessary tools in order for their peoples to have better\r\nlives in years to come.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General has also\r\nplaced emphasis on the disaster caused by HIV/AIDS\r\nthroughout the world. As one of the countries most\r\nseriously affected by the worldwide HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, Cambodia was very pleased by the adoption\r\nof the Declaration of Commitment at the twenty-sixth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the\r\nproblem of HIV/AIDS in June 2001, in accordance\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nwith resolution 55/13, which, in paragraph 1, called on\r\nthe General Assembly,\r\n“as a matter of urgency, to review and address the\r\nproblem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects, as well as\r\nto secure a global commitment to enhancing\r\ncoordination and the intensification of national,\r\nregional and international efforts to combat it in a\r\ncomprehensive manner”.\r\nHowever, the largest burden of such efforts must\r\nfall to the domestic leadership, which must mobilize all\r\nelements of society. The special session has created a\r\nglobal awareness of the problem, which we all should\r\ntake seriously. Its Declaration of Commitment should\r\nbe translated into national platforms to combat this\r\nproblem in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nIn regard to conflict prevention and peace-\r\nbuilding, the United Nations has been discussing this\r\nissue since the early 1990s. As the United Nations\r\nseeks to move from a culture of reaction to one of\r\nprevention, there is a growing consensus that an\r\neffective United Nations prevention strategy requires a\r\nconcerted multi-actor strategy with a focus on long-\r\nterm economic and social factors. There is generally a\r\nconsensus that timely action by the international\r\ncommunity to prevent violent conflict can be difficult\r\nfor a variety of reasons. One is that it is hard to identify\r\nsituations that are appropriate for preventive action;\r\nsecondly, mobilizing resources for preventive action is\r\na challenge in the absence of actual violence; and\r\nthirdly, external intervention is often not welcomed by\r\npotential belligerents.\r\nThere have emerged two schools of thought on\r\nthe future role of the United Nations in the prevention\r\nof violent conflicts. One school maintains that the\r\nUnited Nations should continue to play a central role in\r\npreventive diplomacy. This could be achieved by\r\nstrengthening the United Nations, through its\r\nSecretary-General, the Department of Political Affairs,\r\nkey partners within the United Nations system and a\r\ngreater willingness of the Security Council to act\r\npreventively. The other school would argue that the\r\nresponsibility for prevention should devolve to regional\r\norganizations and other actors. Cambodia’s experience\r\nseems to point to the second alternative as the more\r\nplausible course to follow.\r\nOf course, the proliferation of small arms is\r\nconducive to conflict and fighting, but the root cause of\r\nthe problem is not small arms, which can be supplied\r\nby eager traffickers anytime and anywhere when the\r\nfertile ground of potential conflict is there. Just as we\r\ntreat a sick person, we should combat this illness with\r\ndrugs and, sometimes, with surgery. However, to\r\nprevent illness, that person should do regular exercise\r\nand generally follow a lifestyle that is conducive to\r\ngood health and to building up his or her resistance\r\nagainst illness. Likewise, conflict prevention should\r\nnot only mean preventive diplomacy and peacemaking\r\nafter conflict, but should also address structural\r\nconflict prevention, which deals with the underlying\r\ncauses of conflict, such as the lack of democracy,\r\nhuman rights and economic and social development.\r\nThus, we should not focus only on providing United\r\nNations resources for preventive action. We should\r\nlook upon the collective efforts of peace-building by\r\nthe entire United Nations family and other actors to\r\ndevelop the country, which should also be categorized\r\nas building a culture of prevention.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to join other\r\nrepresentatives in expressing my sincere\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to\r\nthe post of Secretary-General. His long and extensive\r\nexperience in the United Nations has afforded him a\r\ndeep insight into the challenges that the United Nations\r\nhas faced. I am convinced that, with his humble skills,\r\ncommitment and his outstanding vision and leadership,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan will be able to accomplish his noble\r\nmission successfully.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): I wish, first of all, to\r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the work of the Organization.\r\nI wish also to congratulate him on his election for a\r\nsecond term.\r\nHis report has been rendered more relevant by the\r\ntragic events of 11 September and the heinous act of\r\nterrorism that not only affects our host city and\r\ncountry, but has also seriously impacted the work of\r\nour Organization. We therefore welcome the decision\r\nto discuss, on 1 October in the plenary, measures to\r\neliminate terrorism. Myanmar would like to put on\r\nrecord that we oppose terrorism in all forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report underlines the\r\nimportance of strengthening our Organization’s role in\r\nsafeguarding peace and security and the need to\r\nstrengthen its capacity to adjust to changing\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\ninternational circumstances. He terms this the\r\n“tradition of innovation”.\r\nThe United Nations is the universal Organization\r\nbased on state sovereignty. I therefore fully agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General that, in preserving this tradition\r\nof innovation, the principles of the Charter must be\r\nmaintained. As we look to the future to meet the new\r\nchallenges, the Charter’s principles must form the\r\nbedrock of our Organization.\r\nIn our search for peace and security, arms control\r\nand disarmament are of critical importance. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report has again underscored the\r\nfact that in the Millennium Declaration the world’s\r\nleaders committed themselves to the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\r\nweapons. Myanmar therefore shares the\r\ndisappointment expressed in the report regarding the\r\nlow level of international cooperation in disarmament,\r\nparticularly at the Conference on Disarmament.\r\nMyanmar looks forward to the commencement of\r\nnegotiations on disarmament on a non-discriminatory,\r\nmultilateral and internationally and effectively\r\nverifiable treaty banning the production of fissile\r\nmaterials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear\r\nexplosive devices, on the basis of the report of the\r\nSpecial Coordinator and the mandate entrusted to him.\r\nWe once again call upon the Conference on\r\nDisarmament to establish on a priority basis an ad hoc\r\ncommittee to deal with nuclear disarmament and to\r\ncommence negotiations for a phased programme of\r\nnuclear disarmament leading to the eventual\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. In that regard, the\r\nconvening at an early date of an international\r\nconference on disarmament in all its respects would\r\nenable us to identify and deal with concrete measures\r\nto achieve nuclear disarmament.\r\nLet me now turn to another issue, an issue of\r\ncritical importance to the international community.\r\nThis is the HIV/AIDS pandemic, to which the\r\nSecretary-General paid personal attention through his\r\nrecent initiative. The recently concluded twenty-sixth\r\nspecial session, on HIV/AIDS, underscored the need\r\nfor a global effort to combat the disease. The\r\ninternational community has confirmed its commitment\r\nto intensify efforts nationally, regionally and\r\ninternationally.\r\nMyanmar is also fully aware of the tremendous\r\ntoll that the disease could exact, not only on the people\r\naffected but also on society as a whole. HIV/AIDS has\r\ntherefore been designated as a disease of national\r\nconcern in Myanmar, and, accordingly, we are\r\ncommitted to using all available resources to combat it.\r\nWe will also continue to cooperate with national,\r\nregional and international partners on this matter.\r\n Let me now turn to another issue of importance\r\nhighlighted in the report of the Secretary-General:\r\nsustainable development. The Secretary-General\r\nreports that despite the efforts of Governments in both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, of the United\r\nNations system and of the private sector, the challenge\r\nof achieving sustainability remains to be met. Myanmar\r\nviews sustainable development as the harmonious\r\nintegration of a sound and viable economy, responsible\r\ngovernance, social cohesion and harmony and\r\necological integrity to ensure that development is a\r\nlife-enhancing process. At the national level we have\r\ndevoted considerable energy and resources in the\r\nimplementation of Myanmar Agenda 21. National\r\naction, as well as regional and international action, is\r\nindispensable in addressing the challenge of achieving\r\nsustainable development. We therefore look forward to\r\ncooperating with the international community at the\r\nforthcoming World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held at Johannesburg in 2002.\r\nAnother, equally important, international\r\nconference is to be held in Monterrey, Mexico, in\r\nMarch 2002. That is the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development. That Conference will give\r\nus an opportunity to address the issue of economic\r\ndevelopment in a comprehensive and holistic manner.\r\nIt will be the first time that trade, finance and\r\ndevelopment authorities will have a chance to sit down\r\ntogether to find ways and means to address\r\ndevelopment issues in all their aspects. We hope that\r\nthe Conference will result in concrete, substantial and\r\nmeaningful outcomes.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor the report he has submitted to us on the work of the\r\nOrganization in document A/56/1, which offers a\r\nframework for reference and discussion on the broad\r\nagenda being carried out by the United Nations. The\r\nreport is a clear sign that the United Nations, and the\r\nSecretary-General in particular, are moving forward\r\nwith the mandate given to them by the Member States.\r\nThat is why I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nto Mr. Kofi Annan the complete satisfaction of the\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Paraguay at his election\r\nto a second mandate. We are convinced that with his\r\nleadership he will bring the United Nations closer to\r\nthe peoples and adapt the Organization to new and\r\nimportant challenges and to the new reality imposed on\r\nit today by international politics and events.\r\nIn paragraph 4 of his report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral states:\r\n“During the past year, we have witnessed\r\nstriking contrasts on the international scene, both\r\nencouraging developments and dangerous\r\nthreats.”\r\nWho could have imagined that this reflection would\r\nhave materialized in the tragic events of 11 September,\r\nto which we were eyewitnesses? The Government of\r\nthe Republic of Paraguay believes that the cowardly\r\nterrorist acts perpetrated against the United States of\r\nAmerica are also an attack on the free, democratic,\r\ncivilized and peace-loving world. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has correctly said, those attacks were not only\r\nattacks against New York and the United States; they\r\nwere attacks against the entire world. Therefore we\r\nmust remain united in our struggle against terrorism in\r\nall its forms.\r\nThese horrible events have given a distinctive\r\nturn to what we thought at the beginning of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. For this reason the community of nations\r\nmust assume a resolute and firm commitment in favour\r\nof international peace and progress so as to preserve\r\nfor future generations a legacy of democracy, peace\r\nand security, as established by the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nNext week in this very Hall, Member States will\r\nhave an opportunity to debate agenda item 166, entitled\r\n“Measures to eliminate international terrorism”. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the decision to do so and stands\r\nready to participate actively in the discussions. We also\r\nwish to pledge our wholehearted and decisive support\r\nso that the Organization may play its proper role\r\nfirmly, energetically and unequivocally with regard to\r\nthis issue.\r\nThe areas covered by the report are certainly very\r\nimportant, but, given the time allotted to us, we shall\r\nfocus on a few elements we consider to be priorities for\r\nour country.\r\nThe implementation of the goals set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the other commitments\r\nundertaken in other forums of the Organization in the\r\ncontext of development is still among the greatest and\r\nmost urgent challenges to be met in the years to come.\r\nIn this connection, two important meetings will\r\ntake place next year. The International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, which is to be held in\r\nMonterrey, Mexico, will offer an unprecedented\r\nopportunity to collectively examine with all the actors\r\ninvolved the issue of mobilizing development resources\r\nand using them effectively. Likewise, the Rio+10\r\nSummit, which is to be held in Johannesburg, will give\r\nthe international community an opportunity to examine\r\nall aspects of sustainable development in a\r\ncomprehensive manner.\r\nWe are pleased with the fact that the report\r\ndevotes a section to the situation of least developed\r\ncountries and to the important conference held in\r\nBrussels in May of this year. Nevertheless, we believe\r\nthat the report should have made some mention of the\r\nsituation of landlocked countries and small island\r\ndeveloping States. Due to their physical and\r\ngeographic circumstances, which hamper their\r\ndevelopment, these are the most disadvantaged\r\ncountries among developing States. They therefore run\r\na greater risk of being marginalized and of not having\r\nthe same access to the benefits of globalization as other\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe fully agree with the Secretary-General — and\r\nwith most of the speakers that have spoken before\r\nme — that the eradication of poverty is the most\r\ndifficult battle facing the Organization and the\r\ninternational community. That was clearly and firmly\r\nhighlighted at the highest level during the Millennium\r\nSummit. Globalization must be the instrument that\r\nenables all nations to develop within an inclusive and\r\nequitable framework so that all may benefit from its\r\nmany advantages.\r\nWe also agree with the Secretary-General that we\r\nmust accelerate the economic growth of developing\r\ncountries to eradicate poverty. But how can that be\r\ndone? How are we going to achieve economic\r\ndevelopment — and therefore overcome poverty — if\r\ndeveloping countries, and landlocked countries in\r\nparticular, are at a greater disadvantage with regard to\r\ninternational trade and are more isolated from global\r\nmarkets.\r\nAs everyone knows, one of the most serious\r\nproblems faced by landlocked countries is the cost of\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\ntransportation. It is also well known that this is a\r\ndecisive factor in the foreign trade of any country, and\r\nthat it has a serious impact on the possibility of\r\nexpanding trade and, as a result, of achieving more\r\naccelerated economic development. Until developed\r\ncountries and other developing countries open their\r\nmarkets to the goods and commodities of poor\r\ncountries, lift their non-tariff measures and dismantle\r\ntheir farming subsidies, no effort to reduce poverty will\r\nbe successful and we will not be able to reach the goals\r\nset in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThat fact was emphasized by the special high-\r\nlevel meeting of the Economic and Social Council with\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions — which took place in\r\nMay of this year and which is also mentioned in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General. At the same meeting it\r\nwas also acknowledged that the trade protectionism\r\npractised by developed countries, particularly that in\r\nthe agricultural sector, prevent developing countries\r\nfrom fully benefiting from trade. Developing countries\r\nmust have fair access to markets in order to benefit\r\nequally from the multilateral trading system.\r\nMy delegation believes that one of the most\r\nstriking developments of the past year was the\r\nsubmission by the Secretary-General of the report on\r\nthe prevention of armed conflict. We fully agree with\r\nhim that early prevention of armed conflict forces us to\r\nlook at the deep-rooted and structural causes of crises.\r\nRegrettably, we see that this has not received the same\r\nconsideration and analysis from Member States that the\r\nBrahimi report did. We feel that we should begin an\r\nexhaustive study of the report as soon as possible and\r\nreview its recommendations in order to move from a\r\nculture of reaction to one of prevention.\r\nWe also reiterate the importance of promptly\r\nestablishing the International Criminal Court,\r\nespecially at this time. Paraguay ratified the Rome\r\nStatute as a sign of its commitment to justice, peace\r\nand international law. We await its entry into force.\r\nThis year’s report also reflects the United Nations\r\nefforts in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nThe holding of the special session of the General\r\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS — whose purpose was to\r\nexamine all aspects of the problem for the first time at\r\nthe highest level — and the results achieved by it, are\r\nto be commended. In this connection, we reiterate our\r\nsupport for the proposal to establish a global fund\r\nagainst AIDS to support in particular the countries\r\nmost affected and having the greatest need.\r\nFinally, I would like to reiterate our thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for the report under consideration,\r\nas that report will be a useful instrument in the work to\r\nbe done in the future in the various areas of activity of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nMr. Naidu (Fiji): My Government highly\r\ncommends the incisive report of the Secretary-General.\r\nHowever, Fiji laments the fact that its charismatic\r\nimpact has been severely overtaken by the cold-\r\nblooded, vicious terrorist attacks that took place two\r\nweeks ago in our host country — although it helps us\r\nperhaps to understand some of the context of those\r\nattacks. Nonetheless, we congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his many tireless efforts, which are\r\ncandidly summarized in this report.\r\nThere are many lessons to be learned from our\r\nvarying experiences of horror and anger due to the\r\nrecent tragedies. There are also a good number of\r\ninsightful thoughts and narratives in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. The reflections of my delegation will\r\nrefer primarily to the numerous efforts to maintain\r\ninternational security and peace. Most important\r\namong those is the new cultural direction envisaged by\r\nthe report. It is a timely shift, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral now wishes to reinforce, for the United\r\nNations to move from a culture of reaction to one of\r\nprevention. Although this vision preceded the\r\ndeplorable terrorist attacks, the attacks more than\r\nunderscore the urgency of undertaking preventive\r\ndiplomacy in the complexities of modern political\r\ninteractions.\r\nFiji has in the past drawn on its extensive\r\nexperience in peacekeeping. We have increasingly\r\nspoken of the value of maintaining peace in preventing\r\na situation from building into conflict when the need\r\nfor peacekeeping becomes imminent. Peace\r\nmaintenance should be our prior goal, failing which,\r\npeacekeeping, in the planned reforms, should be\r\nreoriented and re-equipped to lay the groundwork for\r\nmore profound and lasting peace-building. Our position\r\nresonates well with the view of the President of the\r\nSecurity Council in February, that a well-planned\r\npeace-building strategy has a positive role in conflict\r\nprevention.\r\nWe echo the Secretary-General’s sentiments about\r\nthe increasing role that Member States and regional\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nand subregional organizations can play, in partnership\r\nwith the United Nations, in peace-building,\r\npeacekeeping and peacemaking. Close cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and relevant regional\r\norganizations has so far yielded productive results\r\ntowards that goal. Fiji is confident that similar progress\r\nstands to be gained in cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Pacific Islands Forum, which will be\r\ndiscussed under a new agenda item at the fifty-sixth\r\nsession.\r\nThe report correctly reflects the prevailing winds\r\nof peace blowing in our Asia-Pacific region. Amicable\r\nrelations and perseverance between the respective\r\nparties have brought about a peaceful settlement in\r\nBougainville. Likewise, we endorse the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s earnest plea to administering agencies to\r\nseek peaceful resolutions to their troubled respective\r\nterritories, and his view that the best solutions for these\r\ncan be found from within each State, in the democratic\r\nnorms and human rights framework to which all\r\nMember States adhere. In our region, we will continue\r\nto support United Nations efforts to assist in ongoing\r\ndemocratic reforms, as indeed we have in East Timor.\r\nWe look forward to continuing progress in the reform\r\nprocess and to witnessing its positive impact on the\r\nremaining territories that are identified in the report.\r\n The report continues to remind us that the\r\ngreatest losers in any conflict are commonly the\r\ninnocent, helpless victims who are ordinarily\r\nvulnerable and who fare the worst in conflict situation.\r\nWomen, children, the aged and the disabled form a\r\nsizeable portion of any population, easily fall prey to\r\nbattles between warring parties and are often\r\ndefenceless.\r\nWe applaud the inroads being made by the\r\nwomen’s lobby in the area of international peace and\r\nsecurity. The gender perspective they have added to the\r\nworld view of conflict is a positive dimension that is\r\nnow triggering cultural change. We celebrate that\r\npositive change, which is taking place in our lifetime\r\nand only one year since the Security Council debate on\r\nthat subject, the subsequent conference and the\r\nadoption of a resolution.\r\nWe cannot agree more about the need for\r\nsustained peacekeeping in Africa in the foreseeable\r\nfuture. Again, Fiji reiterates its willingness to commit\r\nits peacekeeping resources and to apply the skills and\r\nexperience it has gained from numerous United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe report properly reflects on the scale of the\r\nsizeable humanitarian operations that directly result\r\nfrom conflicts or civil unrest. The direct correlation\r\nbetween the two is getting out of control in some areas,\r\nand continues to escalate. Cultivating a culture of\r\nconflict prevention and of peace is an ideal way to\r\naddress some of these difficult questions. This renewed\r\nvision may increasingly see the delivery of\r\npeacekeeping and of humanitarian services in tandem,\r\nas opposed to their being discrete and independent of\r\neach other.\r\nAgain, our congratulations go to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the hard work of the past year and on the\r\nresulting comprehensive report.\r\nMr. Fruchtbaum (Grenada): Once again the\r\nSecretary-General and his associates have performed\r\nthe miracle of preparing their report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/56/1). It is a document that reviews\r\nthe recent past, illuminates the present and indicates\r\nthe issues that are well on the way to becoming crucial\r\nin the near future. In paragraph 5, for example, the\r\nSecretary-General observes that\r\n“universal ideas — the sovereignty of the people,\r\naccountability of leaders, individual rights, and\r\nthe rule of law — are spreading around the\r\nworld”.\r\nSome of the implications of that for our work here have\r\nlong been apparent, but an idea such as the sovereignty\r\nof the people will require us and those who come after\r\nus to think in new directions.\r\nRecent events underscore the importance of one\r\nof the major themes of the report: the rule of law in\r\ninternational affairs. In paragraph 9, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral states that\r\n“The quest of the United Nations to build a\r\nworld of order and justice can be achieved only\r\nthrough respect for the rule of law in international\r\naffairs. The growth of international law, the\r\nratification of international treaties, and the\r\nprosecution of war criminals by international\r\ntribunals will help to ensure that ruthless force\r\ndoes not prevail.”\r\nMy delegation read with considerable interest the\r\nsection on “Enhancing the rule of law” beginning with\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.11\r\nparagraph 216. The Secretary-General observes in\r\nparagraph 219 that\r\n“Many States fail to sign or ratify treaties,\r\nnot because of any lack of political will, but\r\nbecause of a simple shortage of technical\r\nexpertise when it comes to the implementation of\r\ntreaty provisions.”\r\nFor my delegation, the efforts of the Office of Legal\r\nAffairs, in cooperation with the United Nations\r\nInstitute for Training and Research, to address this\r\nproblem are welcome indeed. The demands of the\r\nreporting obligations of treaties, however, will remain\r\nfor a significant number of States a serious difficulty\r\nthat will require assistance to overcome.\r\nMy delegation wholeheartedly agrees with the\r\nSecretary-General when he writes this in paragraph\r\n221: “That the law should be accessible to those whom\r\nit is meant to guide is a central precept of the rule of\r\nlaw”, and we note with satisfaction the undertaking by\r\nthe Office of Legal Affairs to make available on the\r\nInternet the complete texts of the over 50,000 treaties\r\nthat were registered with the Secretariat before May\r\n1998.\r\nAs useful as this will be to those with an interest\r\nin international law, an even greater effort is required.\r\nThe United Nations system, working in cooperation\r\nwith Governments and intergovernmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, must mobilize the\r\nnecessary resources to create a long-term programme\r\ndesigned to make an introduction to the basic concepts\r\nand principles of international law and international\r\nhumanitarian law a fundamental part of every young\r\nperson’s education. Without such an undertaking, our\r\nquest, to quote the Secretary-General, “to build a world\r\nof order and justice … through respect for the rule of\r\nlaw in international affairs” (A/56/1, para. 9) is\r\nunlikely to succeed. We will have more to say about\r\nthis proposal in other forums.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. May I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: We have concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 10.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12. 45 p.m.\r\n"
