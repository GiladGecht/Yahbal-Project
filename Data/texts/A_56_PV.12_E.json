(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 166\r\nMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/160 and\r\nCorr.1 and Add.1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that, at its\r\n3rd plenary meeting, on 14 September 2001, the\r\nGeneral Assembly decided to hold the initial debate on\r\nthis item in the plenary, on the understanding that the\r\nconsideration of the technical aspects of the item will\r\nremain in the Sixth Committee.\r\nI should like to make a brief statement.\r\nWe meet today almost three weeks after the worst\r\nterrorist assault in the history of the world. I know I\r\nspeak for all of us in conveying once again my deepest\r\nsympathy and condolences to the families and loved\r\nones of the more than 6,000 innocent victims.\r\nAs stated in Security Council resolution 1368\r\n(2001) of 12 September and reaffirmed by its\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September, these vicious\r\nattacks, unprecedented in scale and brutality, pose a\r\ndirect threat to international peace and security. More\r\nthan that, these actions were aimed not just at physical\r\ntargets, but indeed at the very structure of the civilized\r\nvalues — peace, freedom, tolerance and human\r\nrights — around which the international community is\r\norganized.\r\nThe General Assembly responded to this\r\nchallenge with alacrity and spoke in strong,\r\nunmistakable tones. On the very first day of the\r\nsession, 12 September, the Assembly unanimously\r\nadopted resolution 56/1, condemning the most heinous\r\nterrorist attacks and calling for greater international\r\ncooperation to prevent and eventually eradicate\r\ninternational terrorism. I am confident that our\r\nmeetings during the next few days will provide a\r\ntimely impetus for achieving the objectives set forth in\r\nresolution 56/1.\r\nIn fact, the issue of international terrorism has\r\nbeen on the agenda of the General Assembly for many\r\nyears. An important step was taken in 1994 when the\r\nAssembly adopted the Declaration on Measures to\r\nEliminate International Terrorism. In 1996, the\r\nAssembly adopted a Declaration to Supplement the\r\n1994 Declaration and established an Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee to address the issue. This Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee, along with a working group of the Sixth\r\nCommittee, was given a mandate to elaborate draft\r\nconventions against international terrorism.\r\nIn recent years, the Assembly has contributed to\r\nthe development of a comprehensive legal framework\r\nof anti-terrorism conventions by adopting two key\r\ninstruments. They are the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, adopted by\r\nAssembly resolution 52/164, which entered into force\r\non 23 May this year, and the Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, adopted by\r\nAssembly resolution 54/109, which so far has gained\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\n45 signatories and four ratifications, requiring 18\r\nadditional ratifications before its entry into force.\r\nBased on such progress in building an effective\r\ninternational framework for combating terrorism, the\r\nMember States are now discussing a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism. This convention,\r\nonce finalized, along with the existing 12 anti-terrorist\r\nconventions dealing with various aspects of terrorism,\r\nwill greatly enhance the ability of the international\r\ncommunity to combat terrorism in all its forms.\r\nTherefore, I would like to take this opportunity to urge\r\nthe Member States to strengthen their efforts to achieve\r\nan early conclusion of the comprehensive convention.\r\nAt the same time, I wish to encourage those Member\r\nStates that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the\r\nexisting conventions as soon as possible.\r\nLast but not least, I want to emphasize that the\r\nfight against terrorism is an issue that transcends\r\ncultural and religious differences, while terrorism itself\r\nthreatens people of all cultures and religious faiths. We\r\nmust never forget that terrorism is not a weapon\r\nwielded by one civilization against another, but rather\r\nan instrument of destruction through which small bands\r\nof criminals seek to undermine civilization itself.\r\nThe United Nations has designated this year as\r\nthe Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. Terrorism is\r\none of the gravest and most urgent of many\r\ninternational issues that can be effectively addressed\r\nonly in the spirit of intercultural dialogue. Through\r\nsuch dialogue, the peoples of the world can unite\r\naround their common interests and shared values, so\r\nmany of which are directly menaced by international\r\nterrorism.\r\nNothing can make amends for the senseless loss\r\nof life on 11 September, but I hope that this\r\nunspeakable tragedy will serve to strengthen our\r\nresolve to one day eliminate the threat of international\r\nterrorism once and for all.\r\nI now give the floor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: On Friday night, the\r\nSecurity Council adopted unanimously a broad\r\nresolution aimed at targeting terrorists and those who\r\nharbour, aid or support them. That resolution requires\r\nMember States to cooperate in a wide range of areas,\r\nfrom suppressing the financing of terrorism to\r\nproviding early warning, cooperating in criminal\r\ninvestigations and exchanging information on possible\r\nterrorist acts. I applaud the Council for acting so\r\nswiftly to enshrine in law the first steps needed to carry\r\nthis fight forward with new vigour and determination.\r\nNow all Member States must make greater efforts\r\nto exchange information about practices that have\r\nproved effective and lessons that have been learned in\r\nthe fight against terrorism so that a global standard of\r\nexcellence can be set. The implementation of this\r\nresolution will require technical expertise at the\r\nnational level. I encourage States that can offer\r\nassistance in this regard to do so — and to do so\r\ngenerously — and without delay.\r\nThus far, the international community has been\r\nable to act with unprecedented speed and unity. On 12\r\nSeptember, both the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council adopted strong resolutions\r\ncondemning the attacks and calling on all States to\r\ncooperate in bringing the perpetrators to justice. Now, a\r\nsecond and more detailed resolution has been adopted\r\nby the Security Council, building swiftly on the first.\r\nToday, this Assembly meets to deliberate its own\r\nresponse to the events of 11 September.\r\nThe reason for this response and unprecedented\r\nunity is clear. The terrorist attacks against the United\r\nStates, resulting in the deaths of some 6,000 people\r\nfrom 80 countries, were acts of terrible evil which\r\nshocked the conscience of the entire world.\r\nBut out of evil can come good. Paradoxically,\r\nthese vicious assaults on our common humanity have\r\nhad the effect of reaffirming our common humanity.\r\nThe very heartlessness and callous indifference to the\r\nsuffering and grief caused to thousands of innocent\r\nfamilies has brought a heartfelt response from millions\r\nof ordinary people all over the world in many different\r\nsocieties.\r\nThe task now is to build on that wave of human\r\nsolidarity to ensure that the momentum is not lost and\r\nto develop a broad, comprehensive and above all\r\nsustained strategy to combat terrorism and eradicate it\r\nfrom our world.\r\nThis important meeting of the General Assembly\r\nhas a critical role to play in this. It must not be merely\r\nsymbolic. It must signal the beginning of immediate,\r\npractical and far-reaching changes in the way this\r\nOrganization and its Member States act against\r\nterrorism.\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nToday, the shock of this crime has united the\r\nworld, but if we are to prevent such crimes from being\r\ncommitted again, we must stay united as we seek to\r\neliminate terrorism. In this struggle, there is simply no\r\nalternative to international cooperation. Terrorism will\r\nbe defeated if the international community summons\r\nthe will to unite in a broad coalition, or it will not be\r\ndefeated at all. The United Nations is uniquely\r\npositioned to serve as the forum for this coalition, and\r\nfor the development of those steps Governments must\r\nnow take — separately and together — to fight\r\nterrorism on a global scale.\r\nThe global reaction to the attacks should give us\r\ncourage and hope that we can succeed in this fight. The\r\nsight of people from every religion gathering in cities\r\nin every part of the world to mourn, and to express\r\nsolidarity with the people of the United States, proves\r\nmore eloquently than any words that terrorism is not an\r\nissue that divides humanity, but one that unites it. We\r\nare in a moral struggle to fight an evil that is anathema\r\nto all faiths. Every State and every people has a part to\r\nplay. This was an attack on humanity, and humanity\r\nmust respond to it as one.\r\nThe urgent business of the United Nations must\r\nnow be to develop a long-term strategy in order to\r\nensure global legitimacy for the struggle ahead. The\r\nlegitimacy that the United Nations conveys can ensure\r\nthat the greatest number of States are able and willing\r\nto take the necessary and difficult steps — diplomatic,\r\nlegal and political — that are needed to defeat\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Member States that are represented here have\r\na clear agenda before them. It begins with ensuring that\r\nthe 12 conventions and protocols on international\r\nterrorism, already drafted and adopted under United\r\nNations auspices, are signed, ratified and implemented\r\nwithout delay by all States.\r\nTwo of these conventions, in particular, can\r\nstrengthen the fight against terrorism. First, the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings, which entered into force on 23\r\nMay this year; and, secondly, the 1999 Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which\r\nso far has 44 signatories and four ratifications. It\r\nrequires 18 additional ratifications to enter into force,\r\nand I hope it will now be seen as a point of honour for\r\nMember States to ratify this vital Convention as soon\r\npossible.\r\nWhile no one imagines that these conventions,\r\neven when implemented, will end terrorism on their\r\nown, they are part of the legal framework needed for\r\nthis effort. I wish to propose to all Member States that\r\nthey make it their first order of business during the\r\ngeneral debate to sign all the conventions on terrorism\r\nand pledge to work for their ratification and\r\nimplementation without delay.\r\nIt will also be important to obtain agreement on a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nIn the post-11 September era, no one can dispute the\r\nnature of the terrorist threat or the need to meet it with\r\na global response. I understand that there are\r\noutstanding issues, which until now have prevented\r\nagreement on the convention. Some of the most\r\ndifficult issues relate to the definition of terrorism. I\r\nunderstand and accept the need for legal precision. But\r\nlet me say frankly that there is also a need for moral\r\nclarity. There can be no acceptance of those who would\r\nseek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent civilian\r\nlife, regardless of cause or grievance. If there is one\r\nuniversal principle that all peoples can agree on, surely\r\nit is that.\r\nEven in situations of armed conflict, the targeting\r\nof innocent civilians is illegal, as well as morally\r\nunacceptable. Yet, as I have stated in my two reports on\r\nthe protection of civilians in armed conflict, civilian\r\npopulations are more and more often deliberately\r\ntargeted. Indeed, civilians have become the principal\r\nvictims of conflict, accounting for an estimated 75 per\r\ncent of all casualties.\r\nThis demands from all of us an increased\r\nattention to the civilian costs of conflict. It requires\r\nMember States to live up to their responsibilities under\r\ninternational law. They must deal firmly with the\r\nreality of armed groups and other non-State actors that\r\nrefuse to respect common principles of human dignity.\r\nIt is hard to imagine how the tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember could have been worse. Yet the truth is that\r\na single attack involving a nuclear or biological\r\nweapon could have killed millions. While the world\r\nwas unable to prevent the 11 September attacks, there\r\nis much we can do to help prevent future terrorist acts\r\ncarried out with weapons of mass destruction. The\r\ngreatest danger arises from a non-State group, or even\r\nan individual, acquiring and using a nuclear, biological\r\nor chemical weapon. Such a weapon could be delivered\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nwithout the need for any missile or any other\r\nsophisticated delivery system.\r\nIn addition to measures taken by individual\r\nMember States, we must now strengthen the global\r\nnorm against the use or proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. This means, among other actions,\r\nredoubling efforts to ensure the universality,\r\nverification and full implementation of key treaties\r\nrelating to weapons of mass destruction, including\r\nthose outlawing chemical and biological weapons, and\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons; promoting cooperation among international\r\norganizations dealing with such weapons; tightening\r\nnational legislation over exports of goods and\r\ntechnologies needed to manufacture weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and their means of delivery; and developing\r\nnew efforts to criminalize the acquisition or use of\r\nweapons of mass destruction by non-State groups.\r\nIn addition, we need to strengthen controls over\r\nother types of weapons that pose grave dangers through\r\nterrorist use. This means doing more to ensure a ban on\r\nthe sale of small arms to non-State groups; making\r\nprogress in eliminating landmines; improving the\r\nphysical protection of sensitive industrial facilities,\r\nincluding nuclear and chemical plants; and increased\r\nvigilance against cyber-terrorist threats.\r\nAs we summon the will and the resources to\r\nsucceed in the struggle against terrorism, we must also\r\ncare for all the victims of terrorism, whether they are\r\nthe direct targets or other populations who will be\r\naffected by our common effort. That is why I have\r\nlaunched an alert to donors about the potential need for\r\nmuch more generous humanitarian assistance to the\r\npeople of Afghanistan.\r\nThis appeal is only the most urgent part of our\r\ndetermination to continue to care for those suffering\r\nfrom poverty, disease and conflict around the world.\r\nThe work of the United Nations in promoting\r\ndevelopment, resolving long-standing disputes and\r\nfighting ignorance and prejudice are even more\r\nimportant today than they were before 11 September.\r\nThe victims of the attacks on 11 September were,\r\nfirst and foremost, the innocent civilians who lost their\r\nlives and the families who now grieve for them. But\r\npeace, tolerance, mutual respect, human rights, the rule\r\nof law and the global economy are all among the\r\ncasualties of the terrorists’ acts.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that repairing the\r\ndamage done to the fabric of the international\r\ncommunity — restoring trust among peoples and\r\ncultures — will not be easy. But just as a concerted\r\ninternational response can make the work of terrorists\r\nmuch harder to accomplish, so should the unity born of\r\nthis tragedy bring all nations together in defence of the\r\nmost basic right: the right of all peoples to live in\r\npeace and security. This is the challenge before us as\r\nwe seek to eliminate the evil of terrorism.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform Members\r\nthat in a letter dated 28 September 2001, addressed to\r\nthe President of the General Assembly, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Greece to the United Nations, in his\r\ncapacity as chairman of the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States for the month of September,\r\nrequests that the General Assembly hear in plenary\r\nmeeting a statement by the observer of Switzerland in\r\nthe debate on agenda item 166, “Measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism”. In view of the importance\r\nattached to the issue under discussion, it is proposed\r\nthat the General Assembly should take a decision on\r\nthat request.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the\r\nproposal to hear a statement by the observer of\r\nSwitzerland in the debate on this item?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nfirst speaker on the list of speakers for this item, I\r\nshould like to recall for the Assembly’s attention that in\r\nthe report contained in document A/56/250, the\r\nGeneral Committee drew the attention of the Assembly\r\nto paragraph 22 of the annex to resolution 51/241,\r\nwhich states,\r\n“Outside the general debate, there shall be a\r\nfifteen-minute time limit in plenary meetings and\r\nin the Main Committees.”\r\nAs delegates may know by now, there are at this\r\npoint 156 speakers already inscribed on the list for this\r\nitem. In order that we may hear all the speakers in good\r\ntime and to avoid meetings late at night, it will be most\r\nhelpful if speakers do their utmost to limit their\r\nstatements to less than 15 minutes, and preferably to 10\r\nminutes. This will facilitate our consideration of this\r\nitem in a timely manner and help us maintain our\r\nprogramme of work for this week. I honestly ask for\r\nthe cooperation of all.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nMay I also remind the Assembly that the ringing\r\nof cellular phones in the Hall disturbs the proceedings\r\nof the plenary. Therefore, I would like to advise\r\nrepresentatives once again to turn off cellular phones or\r\nto switch them to courtesy mode.\r\nMr. Aguirre Sacasa (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Before I begin, President Han, allow me to\r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am\r\ncertain that your personal capability and professional\r\ncompetence will successfully guide us during this\r\nsession. At the same time, I wish to express our\r\nappreciation of and gratitude to the Republic of Korea\r\nfor its profound friendship with Nicaragua.\r\nI also wish to commend your predecessor, Mr.\r\nHarri Holkeri of Finland, for the excellent work he did\r\nduring the fifty-fifth session. Likewise, I wish to pay\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who\r\nwas re-elected to a second mandate, thanks to his\r\ndedication and the great talent with which he has\r\ndirected our Organization.\r\nLast night in the wind and rain, I walked the\r\nstreets of this great metropolis, which, as a sign I saw\r\nread, has been hit but not destroyed by the events of 11\r\nSeptember. I also visited in a subway station one of the\r\nwalls of mourning that the people have spontaneously\r\nassembled to recognize, remember and keep vigil for\r\nthe thousands of missing persons. That was the first\r\ntime that I fully understood and felt the enormity and\r\nhorror of 11 September and the necessity of preventing\r\nevents like that from happening again.\r\nAmbassador Negroponte, I want you to know that\r\nthe people and the Government of Nicaragua share the\r\nsuffering of the people and the Government of the\r\nUnited States, and that we are completely at your side,\r\nready to do anything within our modest reach to\r\neradicate forever the accursed scourge of terrorism.\r\nA few minutes ago, we listened to the moving\r\nwords of The Honourable Rudolph Giuliani, who\r\npersonifies the invincible spirit not only of New York\r\nCity but also of all the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica. His excellent work in the face of the recent\r\nemergency deserves our highest recognition, as do the\r\nbrave members of the Fire Department, Police\r\nDepartment and rescue teams for the exemplary\r\ndetermination they have shown and the ultimate\r\nsacrifice they have made.\r\nThe eyes of the world were fixed on this city,\r\nwatching, almost live, the entire tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember. I was in Lima at a meeting of the Foreign\r\nMinisters of our hemisphere when those savage images\r\nwere engraved in my memory forever. I will always\r\nremember the courage and selflessness with which the\r\nAmerican people, and especially New Yorkers, were\r\nable to deal with this tragedy, in which more than 6,000\r\ninnocent people lost their lives — among them\r\nhundreds of Central Americans — some of them while\r\nfighting heroically to save other lives.\r\nThe gravity of these criminal acts has imposed on\r\nus new and greater challenges, which we need to face\r\nunited. In that regard, Nicaragua considers that all the\r\nMembers of the United Nations need to apply a\r\ncoordinated strategy that will make us effective in our\r\nbattle against international terrorism.\r\nWe must be aware that we now face a common\r\nenemy, an enemy that operates clandestinely, in\r\ncowardly fashion but with great sophistication, an\r\nenemy frequently linked in suspicious ways to other\r\ntransnational crimes, such as drug trafficking, money\r\nlaundering and the diverse forms of organized crime\r\nthat facilitate and finance the commission of these\r\ncriminal acts.\r\nFor this reason, in order to safeguard security for\r\nhumanity and the fundamental values of our\r\ncivilization, we need to press forward, to rise without\r\nhesitation from this trial and to strengthen cooperation\r\nin order to declare together a world war on terrorism, a\r\ncommon enemy of all peoples, of all beliefs and\r\nreligions and of peace and democracy. This is our duty.\r\nThis, I repeat, is an imperative for the community of\r\nnations.\r\nThe first step towards winning the war against\r\nterrorism is not to allow ourselves to be frightened by\r\nits actions. For this reason, Nicaragua decided to\r\nproceed with the Third Meeting of States Parties to the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of Use, Storage,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non their Destruction, held in Managua from 17 to 21\r\nSeptember, despite other international conferences\r\naround the world being cancelled. Nicaragua decided to\r\ngo ahead with the meeting because we did not want to\r\nsurrender to terrorism; we did not want to allow\r\nourselves to be cornered by these sinister forces that\r\nattempt to interrupt normality, paralyze us and turn us\r\ninto hostages of fear, all in the name of causes that are\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\npresented as being noble objectives. We were very\r\nhappy to receive the more than 90 delegations that had\r\nto make tremendous sacrifices and efforts to reach\r\nManagua wishing to express their firm support for\r\npeace, peaceful solutions to conflicts and to\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to the millions of\r\ncitizens who live in countries such as ours affected by\r\nthe presence of anti-personnel mines.\r\nNicaragua has committed itself to being\r\nimplacable against terrorism. We are taking concrete\r\nmeasures, because we are not going to allow our\r\nterritory to be used as a platform for committing such\r\nabominable acts as took place on 11 September.\r\nMore specifically, in order to give a resounding\r\n“NO” to terrorism, we have taken the following\r\nactions: first, our President, Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo,\r\nheld an emergency meeting with his Central American\r\ncounterparts this past 19 September in Honduras to\r\nendorse the Central America United Against Terrorism\r\nDeclaration in which the countries of the isthmus\r\nstrongly condemned any link between groups or sectors\r\nof the Central American region and international\r\nterrorism, and defined immediate actions such as\r\nstrengthening the information- and intelligence-\r\nexchange mechanisms, strengthening border security,\r\nstrengthening control of migratory flows, reforming\r\npenal legislation to make association with terrorist\r\ngroups or persons criminal, freezing and eventually\r\nconfiscating the financial resources of terrorist\r\nnetworks or groups — one of the key points that was\r\nmentioned by Mayor Giuliani — and ensuring the full\r\nforce of all international instruments pertaining to this\r\nmatter.\r\nSecondly, as the host of the Third Conference of\r\nthe States Parties of the Ottawa Treaty, Nicaragua\r\npromoted a declaration with an energetic condemnation\r\nof the horrible terrorist attacks of 11 September, in\r\nwhich we urged all countries to work together to bring\r\nto justice the perpetrators of these despicable acts, as\r\nwell as those who assist and support them. We also\r\nappealed to the international community to augment\r\nthe efforts to frustrate terrorism through an increase in\r\ncooperation and the full implementation of\r\ninternational conventions and Security Council\r\nresolutions, including the Council resolution of 12\r\nSeptember 2001 and that of the General Assembly of\r\nthe same day.\r\nAt the Organization of American States (OAS),\r\nNicaragua co-sponsored the Brazilian initiative to\r\nconvene immediately the organ of Consultation of the\r\nInter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. In\r\nkeeping with this position, Nicaragua joined the States\r\nof the hemisphere in approving concrete measures\r\nagainst terrorism, among them the creation of a draft\r\nfor the inter-American convention against terrorism,\r\nwith the aim of protecting our common values and the\r\nright of our citizens to live in peaceful and secure\r\nsurroundings.\r\nLastly, this past 27 September, at a meeting of the\r\nCentral American Security Commission, the countries\r\nof the isthmus agreed to create new mechanisms of\r\nsecurity and coordination between the armed forces,\r\nimmigration and police institutions of Central America\r\nin order to present a united front against terrorism.\r\nI wish to recall that the ideal that brings us\r\ntogether in this Headquarters is none other than to\r\ncombine our efforts for the benefit of humanity to\r\neradicate the terrorist threat. There is no doubt that this\r\nevil has advanced to use more destructive forms. But\r\nwe cannot allow more innocent human beings to\r\nperish; we cannot allow terrorists to sow desperation,\r\nfear and anxiety. For this reason, as you, Mr. Secretary-\r\nGeneral, recently affirmed, “the United Nations must\r\nhave the courage to recognize that just as there are\r\ncommon aims, there are common enemies”. In this\r\nscenario, there is no room to be neutral. No one can\r\nremain passive or indifferent.\r\nFor this reason, Nicaragua supports the draft\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism,\r\nfor which negotiations were initiated based on the draft\r\npresented by the Government of India, an initiative\r\nwhich we consider extremely important. Equally, we\r\nare very satisfied with and fully support resolution\r\n1373 (2001), which was unanimously adopted last\r\nFriday by the Security Council, and which establishes a\r\nwide-ranging framework for combating all aspects of\r\nterrorism.\r\nNicaragua supports the considerations of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General, who has recognized\r\nour Organization as the natural forum for building a\r\nuniversal coalition, giving long-term global legitimacy\r\nto the fight against terrorism.\r\nNevertheless, the universal calling of our\r\nOrganization cannot be complete as long as there is a\r\nState with profound democratic roots that cannot\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nparticipate as a full member in the work of the United\r\nNations system. I am referring to the Republic of\r\nChina, Taiwan. Like all the citizens of the world, its 23\r\nmillion inhabitants suffer the effects of terrorism and\r\nshould, in the United Nations, add their own\r\nexperience, technology and actions to the universal\r\nefforts against these acts that threaten world peace and\r\nthe security of all peoples.\r\nMay I refer to the efforts that my own country has\r\nundertaken to build a political system based on the\r\nvalues of full respect for democracy, leaving behind the\r\nculture of violence as a means of resolving our\r\ndifferences. In this respect, I would like to emphasize\r\nthat the next presidential election to be held in my\r\ncountry, on 4 November, will be the third consecutive,\r\nfree and democratic presidential election in our history,\r\nonce again giving evidence of the growing political\r\nmaturity of the Nicaraguan people and their firm desire\r\nto continue the destiny of the nation on the path of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nWe have initiated the preparations for these\r\nelections with the certainty that they will be a\r\ntranscendental step in strengthening our young\r\ndemocracy. Nevertheless, to ensure the transparency\r\nand the credibility of this process, we have invited\r\nmany of the countries represented here to send\r\nelectoral observer missions. This morning I want to\r\nreiterate this invitation and to thank the countries that\r\nhave already decided to send observers to participate\r\nwith the Nicaraguans in this joyful civic exercise.\r\nIn conclusion, Nicaragua, which has been the\r\nvictim of war, with its aftermath of pain and suffering,\r\nshares the mourning of the families of the victims of 11\r\nSeptember, and we harbour the hope that with their\r\nunbreakable faith in the future, they will be able to\r\nrecover from this tragedy.\r\nThe cold-blooded murder of many innocent\r\npeople and the wave of fear caused by these terrorists\r\nthroughout the world show us the need to fight in unity\r\nagainst the scourge of terrorism. We should, I repeat,\r\ndeclare a world war against it.\r\nOur aim should be to carry out joint actions in the\r\nframework of our universal Organization, in order to\r\ngive no respite or quarter, in order not to allow\r\nnegotiation or discussion on a right of all humankind:\r\nthe right to live free of the fear of terrorism.\r\nMr. Negroponte (United States of America):\r\nThis session of the General Assembly, as members all\r\nknow, was meant to implement the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, issued one year ago this month. In it, we\r\ndeclared certain fundamental values to be essential to\r\ninternational relations in the twenty-first century:\r\nfreedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for\r\nnature and shared responsibility.\r\nEveryone here has stood in my place, making his\r\nor her first remarks to the General Assembly, so I am\r\nsure all can well understand how pleased I would have\r\nbeen to address these inspiring themes. With the breach\r\nbetween the United States Congress and the President\r\nover how to best support the United Nations now\r\nhealed, I could have used my time with the Assembly\r\nthis morning to describe the United States renewed\r\ncommitment to a world reborn in the spirit of peace\r\nand cooperation. That is a speech I am committed to\r\ndeliver, I assure the Assembly, but not today.\r\nTragically, the heinous terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 have led us, all of us, not to the\r\nMillennium Declaration but back to our original\r\ndeclaration of 25 June 1945. We expressed our political\r\nwill then in terms that were firm and clear, and I would\r\nbe hard pressed to improve upon them. But if I may\r\nadd a single word to the preamble of the Charter of this\r\ngreat body, let me say that “We the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations remain determined to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war”.\r\nThe barbarities of 11 September — the\r\nunspeakable loss of life, the destruction of the World\r\nTrade Center, the suicidal flight into the walls of the\r\nPentagon, the horrifying crash of a commercial airliner\r\nin a field in Pennsylvania — were very different from\r\nthe scourge of war our predecessors knew and pledged\r\nto end, but they were acts of war nonetheless. And as\r\nPresident Bush has said, we will meet this violence\r\nwith justice that is patient, but “whether we bring our\r\nenemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies,\r\njustice will be done”.\r\nOn 11 September, the world witnessed the final\r\ntransformation of terror from agony to crisis. We knew\r\nwe had cancer. Now we know it has metastasized. The\r\nAl-Qaeda terrorist network reached into the very\r\nsystems of cooperation and communication that we\r\nhave painstakingly established to bring the world\r\ncloser together — from civil aviation to\r\ntelecommunications, to the transfer of money, to the\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nfree movement of people — and turned the building\r\nblocks of peace into weapons of war. Men suicidally\r\nintoxicated with a vision of the void perverted the basic\r\nelements of civilized life and dared call their deeds the\r\nworks of God. Some power possessed them, but not a\r\nhigher power; some power that rendered the impact of\r\nthese assaults exponentially greater than anything we\r\nhave ever witnessed before; some power that is the\r\ndark antithesis of the light we all want to see at the\r\ndawn of the new millennium.\r\nThe attacks of 11 September took place within the\r\nterritory of the United States, but the grief has spread\r\nfar beyond our borders. My delegation is not the only\r\none that mourns. Scores of nations lost their citizens,\r\ntheir brothers and sisters, their parents and their\r\nchildren. Our deepest sympathies go to all of them.\r\nAnd let me say that the offers of support we have\r\nreceived in return — specially trained Asian\r\nfirefighters, European burn teams, Latin American\r\nurban rescuers, Arab physicians and African trauma\r\nmanagers — have touched the people of the United\r\nStates deeply.\r\nAs we meet here today, I know all present join me\r\nin asking, “What more can we do?” “What more must\r\nwe do?” Despite the urgency and the anger we feel,\r\nsome answers to those questions will take time in\r\ncoming. After all, 11 September is only a few weeks\r\npast. But more than time — and this is the heart of my\r\nmessage to members today — the answers to those\r\nquestions will require the sustained application of\r\npolitical will, a vital commitment to one another that\r\ninfuses all of the measures that we take today and will\r\ngive us the courage to undertake unforeseeable actions\r\ntomorrow. I know we can muster that political will\r\nbecause the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil both showed it in their swift resolutions of 12\r\nSeptember: an unprecedented manifestation of our\r\ncollective outrage and condemnation.\r\nThe struggle we face will be lengthy. Its progress\r\nwill be erratic. Already we see heartening results\r\nthrough effective law enforcement around the world,\r\nbut this war will not be over until we shatter the global\r\nterrorists’ ability to share information, techniques,\r\npersonnel, money, and weapons. And as we dismantle\r\nthe terrorists’ ability to leverage their resources by\r\ncross-border subterfuge, we must also shut down their\r\nactivities in each and every Member State. We cannot\r\nlet them act together; we cannot let them act alone; we\r\ncannot let them act at all.\r\nThree days ago the Security Council spelled out\r\nour immediate tasks in resolution 1373 (2001). It is an\r\nurgent call to action. All of us must emphasize to our\r\nGovernments the critical need to implement the\r\nmeasures it mandates. Resolution 1373 (2001) goes to\r\nthe heart of how terrorism operates — it will deny the\r\nterrorists financing, safe haven and other forms of\r\nsupport; the Security Council itself will closely\r\nmonitor its implementation. Yes, resolution 1373\r\n(2001) will impose on all of us the highest standards of\r\nvigilance, but vigilance is the price of freedom. And\r\nfreedom, the first value of the new millennium, is\r\nworth the price of vigilance and more.\r\nPresident Bush has made our policy clear:\r\n“We will direct every resource at our\r\ncommand — every means of diplomacy, every\r\ntool of intelligence, every instrument of law\r\nenforcement, every financial influence, and every\r\nnecessary weapon of war — to the disruption and\r\nto the defeat of the global terror network.”\r\nThe United States, like all members, has the right to\r\ndefend itself. But we do not feel alone in our struggle,\r\nand we are not proceeding alone. In this great house of\r\nnations, we have many friends. We know that.\r\nWe also know that the war we wage is not a battle\r\nagainst Islam. The terrorists we confront cannot\r\ndeceive us by attempting to wrap themselves in Islam’s\r\nglorious mantle. Islam’s great leaders and scholars tell\r\nus otherwise. Our own history and experience tell us\r\notherwise. We helped defend Muslims in Kuwait. We\r\nhelped defend Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo. We\r\nremain the largest single provider of humanitarian aid\r\nto Afghanistan. There are over 1,200 mosques and 2\r\nmillion Muslims in the United States, and their faith is\r\na gift we revere and cherish. So we must be prepared to\r\nrepeat again and again the simple truth: there is no\r\ndivision between the United States and Islam; the\r\ndivision that exists is between the civilized world and\r\nterror, between the rule of law and the chaos of crime,\r\nbetween a world at peace and a world in peril.\r\nI have spent my adult life as a diplomat, much of\r\nthe time abroad, but I lived here in New York from\r\nchildhood until I was 21. I lived here during the\r\nSecond World War. I lived here during the Korean War.\r\nAnd I lived here during some of the worst moments of\r\nthe cold war. During those difficult times we New\r\nYorkers came to believe that we had a special\r\nrelationship with the world through the vision of men\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nlike Churchill and Roosevelt, Hammarskjöld and\r\nU Thant. What they dreamed, and what they built, right\r\nhere in my hometown, was an institution that rejected\r\nconflict and embraced cooperation.\r\nNow our spirit of cooperation is going to be\r\ntested. In the months and perhaps years ahead, we often\r\nwill be frustrated, we often will be disappointed. But\r\nyou, too, live in the city where the tragedy was\r\ngreatest. You, too, have seen this disaster with your\r\nown eyes, and you know there is no way to prevent\r\nsuch a thing happening again unless we make common\r\ncause. Justice demands that global terrorism be\r\nsilenced so that the Millennium Declaration of the\r\nUnited Nations can be heard. Through shared\r\nresponsibility, the last of the Millennium Declaration’s\r\nfundamental values, I am sure that goal will be\r\nachieved.\r\nMr. de Ruyt (Belgium) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated\r\nwith the European Union — Bulgaria, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,\r\nRomania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the associated\r\ncountries of Cyprus, Malta and Turkey align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nAllow me first of all, Mr. President and\r\nMr. Secretary-General, to commend you for giving us\r\nthe opportunity to address this issue today, which\r\nmobilizes us all within this Assembly.\r\nThe terrorist attacks perpetrated in New York,\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11 September\r\nare an assault not only on the United States, but on all\r\nour open, democratic, tolerant and multicultural\r\nsocieties. They are a challenge to the conscience of\r\nevery human being. The Union condemns with the\r\nutmost forcefulness the perpetrators and sponsors of\r\nthese barbarous acts and reaffirms its complete\r\nsolidarity with the American Government and people\r\nin the face of these attacks. This condemnation is,\r\nfurthermore, unanimous, as demonstrated by the\r\nactions already taken in our Organization, such as\r\nresolution 56/l and Security Council resolution 1368\r\n(2001), adopted the day after the attacks, as well as\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), adopted last\r\nFriday. The Union and its member States will be\r\nunstinting in their efforts to help identify, bring to\r\njustice and punish those responsible for these heinous\r\nacts and their accomplices. The Union will cooperate\r\nclosely with the United States and the entire\r\ninternational community to combat international\r\nterrorism.\r\nTerrorism is a real challenge to the whole world.\r\nCombating it also means ensuring respect for\r\ndemocracy. The heads of State and Government of the\r\nEuropean Union, meeting in extraordinary session on\r\n21 September 2001, decided to make the fight against\r\nterrorism a priority of the Union. It will step up its\r\naction against terrorism through a coordinated and\r\ninterdisciplinary approach embracing all Union\r\npolicies. It will ensure that that approach is reconciled\r\nwith respect for the fundamental freedoms that form\r\nthe basis of all civilization. Moreover, this fight against\r\nterrorism should be coupled with the search for\r\nsustainable solutions for the human and political\r\ntragedies that are factors in the instability that feeds\r\nterrorists groups.\r\nThe fight against terrorism requires the broadest\r\npossible global coalition. That coalition should be\r\nformed under the auspices of the United Nations,\r\nwhich remains the most appropriate forum for\r\nrevitalizing and strengthening our coordinated efforts\r\nto eliminate international terrorism. The United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies have in the past\r\nsuccessfully elaborated a series of sectoral anti-terrorist\r\nconventions which, taken together, constitute the\r\ninternational legal framework for combating terrorism.\r\nIn particular, there are 12 conventions which cover\r\nspecific categories of terrorist acts. The most recent\r\ninstruments are the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, adopted respectively in 1997\r\nand 1999.\r\nEradicating international terrorism will be\r\npossible only if all countries are unreservedly\r\ncommitted to the fight. Universal accession to anti-\r\nterrorist conventions is essential. It is therefore crucial\r\nthat all States become parties to those conventions as a\r\nmatter of urgency.\r\nThe International Convention for the Suppression\r\nof the Financing of Terrorism is especially important.\r\nCombating the funding of terrorism is a key aspect of\r\nEuropean anti-terrorism policy. Vigorous international\r\naction is needed to ensure that the fight is completely\r\neffective. To that end, the European Union has decided\r\nto take all necessary measures to combat all forms of\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nfinancing of terrorist activities. Those measures follow\r\nthe spirit of the provisions adopted in that regard by the\r\nSecurity Council in its very important resolution 1373\r\n(2001). The European Council has called on the States\r\nmembers of the European Union to sign and ratify, as a\r\nmatter of urgency, the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Measures\r\nwill be taken against uncooperative countries and\r\nterritories identified by the Financial Action Task\r\nForce.\r\nThe international legal framework of anti-terrorist\r\nconventions is solid, but it contains loopholes and gaps\r\nwhich must be closed. To that end, the special Sixth\r\nCommittee working group and the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nestablished by the General Assembly in its resolution\r\n51/210 were requested by the Assembly to elaborate a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nThe European Union thanks India for taking the\r\ninitiative to present a proposal to that end, and calls\r\nupon all Member States to work together to arrive at a\r\nsatisfactory outcome on the unresolved questions. It\r\nunderlines once again that such a comprehensive\r\nconvention should bring added value to the existing\r\nsectoral conventions, in particular by filling the gaps\r\nwhile preserving their achievements. The European\r\nUnion also calls on Member States to conclude the\r\nnegotiations on a draft convention for the suppression\r\nof acts of nuclear terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations Convention against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime, adopted in 2000, and\r\nits Protocols, are an important addition to the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. Although the Convention does not\r\nspecifically address terrorism, it deals with financial\r\ncrime, money laundering and corruption. Those wide-\r\nranging provisions will unquestionably assist the\r\ninternational community in its fight against terrorism\r\nby preventing and combating criminal activity in\r\nsupport of terrorism. I should like to point out here that\r\nall the States members of the European Union have\r\nsigned the Convention.\r\nWe take note of the adoption on 6 September of\r\nthe revised draft plans of action for the implementation\r\nof the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice, a\r\nchapter of which is devoted to specific\r\nrecommendations for national and international action\r\nagainst terrorism. We support the adoption of the draft\r\nplans by the General Assembly.\r\nClearly, the implementation of these conventions\r\nis just as important as their ratification. The European\r\nUnion calls on all countries to take the measures\r\nnecessary to implement these instruments as a matter\r\nof urgency. It also asks the States Members of the United\r\nNations to consider possible ways to introduce a\r\nmechanism for monitoring their implementation in the\r\nUnited Nations framework. We attach great importance\r\nto this kind of monitoring mechanism and we note with\r\ninterest that such a monitoring instrument was\r\nestablished by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\r\nof 28 September 2001 in order to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of that resolution.\r\nIn the meantime, the European Union considers\r\nthat it would be useful to give a higher profile to the\r\nSecretariat’s annual report on the status and\r\nimplementation of multilateral, regional and bilateral\r\nagreements on international terrorism. The European\r\nUnion intends to ask the Secretariat to publish that\r\nreport on the United Nations web site.\r\nIn addition to such efforts, the United Nations\r\nmust continue to explore other ways of combating\r\nterrorism. Until now, the emphasis has been, quite\r\nrightly, on judicial cooperation in prosecuting and\r\nextraditing those guilty of terrorist acts in all their\r\naspects. Other forms of cooperation could be envisaged\r\nor strengthened, for instance in the areas of preventive\r\nmeasures and exchange of information. Furthermore,\r\nwe are convinced that the integration of all countries\r\ninto a fair world system of security, prosperity and\r\nimproved development is a condition for a community\r\nthat will be strong and sustained in its fight against\r\nterrorism. The fight against the scourge of terrorism\r\nwill be all the more effective if it is based on an in-\r\ndepth political dialogue with all the world’s countries\r\nand regions. In that regard, conflict prevention should\r\nmore than ever be a priority on the international\r\nagenda.\r\nThe prospect of seeing terrorists acquire means of\r\nmass destruction is among the most terrifying of all.\r\nThe international community must increase its efforts\r\nto intensify cooperation on non-proliferation regimes\r\nfor nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.\r\nThe European Union considers that strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation must go hand in hand with\r\nstrengthening regional cooperation. It calls for\r\nstrengthened regional cooperation in the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism, as a matter of urgency. In that\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nregard, the European Council has adopted a plan of\r\naction aimed at bolstering European policies to combat\r\nterrorism in various fields. Here, strengthening judicial\r\nand police cooperation is a crucial element. The\r\nEuropean Council has agreed to establish a European\r\narrest warrant and to adopt a common definition of\r\nterrorism. The European warrant will replace existing\r\nextradition arrangements among European Union\r\nmember States and will allow wanted persons to be\r\nhanded over directly from one judicial authority to\r\nanother. Fundamental rights and freedoms will be\r\nguaranteed. The detailed arrangements for that\r\nagreement will be finalized soon, in December 2001.\r\nIn parallel with strengthening judicial\r\ncooperation, measures have also been taken to\r\nstrengthen police cooperation. In particular, the\r\nEuropean Council has called for the identification of\r\npresumed terrorists in Europe and of organizations\r\nsupporting them, with a view to drawing up a common\r\nlist of terrorist organizations. European Union member\r\nStates will also share with the European Police Office\r\n(EUROPOL), systematically and without delay, all\r\nuseful information on terrorism. Within EUROPOL, a\r\nteam of anti-terrorism specialists will be set up as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nThe European Council has decided that measures\r\nshould be taken to increase air transport security. These\r\nwill relate to weapons classification, technical training\r\nof crews, baggage checks, protection of cockpit access,\r\nand monitoring the quality of the security measures\r\ntaken by member States. In particular, the effective and\r\nuniform application of air security measures will be\r\nensured by reciprocal checks, which will be set up\r\nwithout delay.\r\nThe members of the European Council have\r\nappealed to the international community to pursue\r\ndialogue and negotiation in all multilateral forums with\r\na view to building, in Europe and elsewhere, a world in\r\nwhich peace, tolerance and the rule of law will prevail.\r\nIn that respect, we would also like to stress the need to\r\ncombat any nationalist, racist or xenophobic\r\ntendencies, and we firmly reject any attempt to equate\r\nterrorism with the Arab or Muslim world.\r\nThe task awaiting us is of the utmost importance.\r\nThe European Union is convinced that together and\r\nspeaking with one voice, through our joint efforts and\r\nour common will, we will realize our goal: to eradicate\r\nthe scourge of terrorism, in order to preserve\r\nhumankind, as well our common values and liberties,\r\nfrom its odious ravages.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): A year\r\nago, during the Millennium Summit, here in the\r\nAssembly and in this very city — which has been so\r\nsorely tried but is still upright and more determined\r\nthan ever in the face of adversity — we made a solemn\r\ncommitment to build for future generations a world\r\nfree of fear, hunger and ignorance. This was, no doubt,\r\na magnificent show of generosity and solidarity. What\r\ncould be more uplifting for humankind to share the\r\nsame dreams and the same hopes?\r\nIndeed, the compassion and the sincere and\r\nspontaneous outpouring of sympathy from peoples\r\nthroughout the world for the victims of the terrible\r\nattacks on New York and Washington have shown that\r\nwe are more than ever linked by a common destiny and\r\nthat, in difficult times, we know how to transcend our\r\ndifferences. That is why, when terrorists struck the\r\nUnited States — and every time they strike\r\nelsewhere — the target is that sacrosanct link we all\r\nhave to the same human family.\r\nIt is thus important and necessary that, in the\r\naftermath of the horrible terrorist attacks which have\r\nplunged not only the American nation but the entire\r\nhuman family into mourning, that the General\r\nAssembly — as the Security Council has done —\r\nvigorously condemn these heinous acts.\r\nToday, now that it has understood the true nature\r\nof terrorism and the seriousness of the threat it poses to\r\nall of humankind — without any distinction as to race,\r\nculture or religion — it is imperative that the\r\nAssembly, which has decided to deal directly with this\r\ncrucial issue, adopt as soon as possible a concerted,\r\nwell-thought-out strategy and agree on the ways which\r\nwill enable it to triumph over this new scourge of\r\nmodern times.\r\nWho other than this Organization, which\r\ncomprises all of the nations of the world, has the\r\nlegitimacy, the political determination and the\r\nnecessary capacity to wage this campaign successfully?\r\nLet me note, however, that it has taken many\r\ninnocent victims and many isolated struggles —\r\nincluding that which my country has waged for many\r\nyears now — for us finally to become aware of the fact\r\nthat terrorism is not inherent to a particular area of the\r\nworld but is a global threat to which no country is\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nimmune. Putting an end to terrorism will require the\r\nmobilization and commitment of all nations of the\r\nworld.\r\nIf there is an observation to be made following\r\nthe terrible attacks of 11 September, it is that\r\nterrorism — above and beyond what we might have\r\nfeared or imagined — has been able to adapt itself to\r\nthe political, economic and technological changes that\r\nthe world has seen in recent years. It has taken full\r\nadvantage of the fresh prospects offered by\r\nglobalization in terms of the free movement of\r\nindividuals, goods, ideas and capital. It has been able\r\nalso to use to its benefit the knowledge and the\r\ncommunications facilities that new information\r\ntechnologies have made available to all of us. Finally,\r\nit has been able to establish and consolidate its links\r\nwith international crime, which for its part, thanks to\r\nglobalization, has been able to develop its methods and\r\nincrease its capacity for action.\r\nWhat the international community is henceforth\r\nfacing is terrorism of a new type. This new terrorism\r\nhas sophisticated means and methods; it is organized\r\ninto a myriad of cells and support or action networks,\r\nwhich have joined up and formed an alliance with\r\ndrug-trafficking and money-laundering circles; it has\r\nunlimited financial resources at its disposal; and it will\r\nstop at nothing in the all-out war it has declared against\r\nall of humankind.\r\nIn face of such a challenge, the international\r\ncommunity is in duty bound to present a common front,\r\nto join ranks and to act with determination in a fight\r\nthat will be lengthy and costly but that we must win.\r\nWhat form should this fight take? How should we\r\nconduct it? What are the objectives we should assign\r\nourselves? What are the means to be mobilized in order\r\nfor it to succeed? These are the questions we must ask\r\nourselves and to which we must respond collectively,\r\nin a spirit of solidarity and with the determination that\r\nthe scope of the challenge requires of us.\r\nThis fight must take on various forms, which all\r\nmust find their place and their full expression in a\r\nrenewed, strengthened and broadened international\r\ncooperation involving all international actors, and\r\nwhich the United Nations must plan and implement. In\r\nthis decisive struggle, States, international,\r\nintergovernmental and regional organizations, financial\r\nand business circles, civil society and the media must\r\nbecome involved, and each and every one must\r\ndischarge its role and live up to its responsibilities.\r\nThe objectives are clear. We must eradicate\r\nterrorism in all of its forms and endeavour to root it out\r\nby attacking resolutely both its manifestations and the\r\nsupport for it — be it overt or covert — as well as its\r\nunderlying causes and its roots. We must not declare\r\nwar against any individual people, religion, culture or\r\ncivilization, especially given that terrorism, like\r\nextremism and fanaticism, is not characteristic of any\r\none determined religion or civilization but is,\r\nunfortunately, a universal evil. Terrorism must be\r\nunderstood, therefore, in its universality; no selective\r\nor differentiated approach, depending on the location\r\nor on its victims, can be taken. In order to be effective\r\nand consensus-based, the fight against this\r\nphenomenon cannot be limited simply to an\r\ninstrumental policy, and approaches that could entail\r\ndisastrous consequences for relations between peoples\r\nand civilizations cannot be tolerated.\r\nWith respect to the measures to be taken, it is\r\nvital once and for all to adapt official anti-terrorist\r\nrhetoric to the reality on the ground, and to call on\r\nthose who have been lax with regard to terrorism to\r\nhenceforth speak with determination and to honour the\r\ncommitments they have entered into.\r\nFrom this standpoint, we believe that the time has\r\ncome for all States the world over to take a zero-\r\ntolerance approach to terrorists. Until recently,\r\nterrorists had been abusing the right of asylum that had\r\nbeen generously granted them on the basis of a certain\r\nview of human rights, and they had been claiming\r\nresponsibility, with full impunity, for their crimes from\r\nmajor world capitals, where they had found refuge and\r\nsometimes were even prospering.\r\nMoreover, the 12 international instruments on\r\nterrorism must be scrupulously implemented and the\r\ncountries that have not yet done so must ratify the\r\nvarious conventions as soon as possible, including\r\nthose on bombings and on the financing of terrorism.\r\nWe should also provide countries victims of\r\nterrorism with the appropriate means and equipment to\r\nenable them effectively to combat terrorism. We should\r\nreserve the same treatment meted out to those who\r\ncarry out terrorist acts for their commanders and\r\naccomplices, regardless of where such acts occur and\r\nthe nationality of the guilty.\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nFinally, we must urgently adopt collective\r\nmeasures that should be implemented without delay,\r\nparticularly with regard to judicial cooperation and the\r\nexchange of information between the services\r\nconcerned, including banking, and we must strengthen\r\nInterpol’s capacity to act. All of this will allow us to\r\nact firmly, diligently and effectively against the\r\nlogistical, financial, political and arms-supply support\r\nnetworks of terrorist groups established in various\r\ncountries throughout the world.\r\nFrom this standpoint, my delegation welcomed\r\nthe adoption by the Security Council on 28 September\r\nof a briskly worded resolution against terrorism and\r\ncalls for the strict implementation of measures set forth\r\ntherein, especially those concerning the financing of\r\nterrorist acts, active or passive support for terrorist\r\ngroups and the prevention of terrorist acts through the\r\nexchange of information, the denial of safe haven to\r\nthose who commit, plan, finance or support terrorist\r\nacts, the use of any other’s territory for the financing,\r\nplanning or preparation of terrorist acts, the monitoring\r\nof borders to prevent the passage of terrorists and the\r\ndenial of asylum or political refugee status to those\r\ninvolved in terrorist acts.\r\nOn a different level, that of international law,\r\nthere is an entire panoply of legal instruments that\r\nserve as a normative basis for all efforts to codify or\r\ndraft a common global anti-terrorism strategy. This\r\narsenal has been strengthened at the international level\r\nin recent years, especially within the United Nations,\r\nwhere a series of conventions have been negotiated and\r\nfinalized. The most recent of these are the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\r\nand the International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nthe Financing of Terrorism, whose entry into force\r\nmust now be accelerated. Negotiations are under way\r\non the draft comprehensive convention submitted by\r\nthe delegation of India, which enjoys our full support,\r\ngiven that it fully reflects the Algerian call for a global\r\nconvention on terrorism in all its aspects and in all its\r\nforms and manifestations and that it would complete\r\nthe existing arsenal in this regard and offer a juridical\r\nframework broad enough to cover the various aspects\r\nof the terrorist phenomenon. This text also ensures a\r\nholistic and consistent approach to all terrorist acts,\r\ninstead of the piecemeal and fragmentary approach\r\ntaken to date.\r\nThis draft is founded on the general principle of\r\n“prosecute or extradite” and on that of the\r\ndepoliticization of terrorist acts. It seeks to prevent\r\nsuch acts, whatever their specifics and particular\r\ncharacteristics, and to take on new forms of terrorism\r\nthat have not been foreseen in the existing sectoral\r\nconventions. It not only fills the gaps in the current\r\nlegal framework, but is also innovative in extending its\r\nscope of implementation to threats of terrorist acts and\r\nto acts in preparation, which are not covered by certain\r\nsectoral conventions.\r\nMy country urges all countries to cooperate to\r\nensure that this important legal instrument can be\r\nadopted, if possible, at this session. No one should\r\nassume the political or moral responsibility of\r\nhindering the completion and adoption of that\r\ninstrument, which the international community so\r\nsorely needs.\r\nUnilateral and even bilateral or regional action is\r\ninsufficient, as we have said, to fight this global\r\nmenace. It is possible to wage an effective fight against\r\nterrorism only through the joint, coordinated action of\r\nStates within the framework of the United Nations,\r\nwhich, given its universality, is in the best position to\r\ncoordinate the activities of Member States in this\r\nsphere. The General Assembly has indeed shown the\r\nway by adopting, on 9 December 1994, the Declaration\r\non Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, the\r\nimportance of which has been continuously reaffirmed\r\never since. The United Nations should continue to play\r\na more dynamic role in promoting international\r\ncooperation in the prevention and suppression of\r\nterrorist acts. In this regard, my country fully supports\r\nthe proposal to convene, under United Nations\r\nauspices, a high-level conference to draft an organized\r\nand joint response to terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nThe fight against terrorism has made equally\r\nsignificant progress in regional bodies. In this regard,\r\nmy country believes that regional consultations and\r\ncooperation are essential to establishing effective\r\nsecurity and juridical arrangements to complement\r\ninternational efforts. In this respect, we are pleased to\r\nnote that such cooperation is beginning to take shape in\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\nIdentical efforts, in which my country has\r\nactively participated and which it has sometimes\r\ninitiated or called for, have been made in the League of\r\nArab States, the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, which have\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\ndrafted anti-terrorism instruments that my country has\r\nsigned and ratified.\r\nAlgeria is firmly committed to the campaign\r\nagainst terrorism, entertains no ambivalence on the\r\nissue and is a party to almost every international\r\nconvention on terrorism. We intend to pursue the fight\r\nagainst this scourge with determination, in strict\r\nrespect for our national laws and the principles and\r\nnorms of international law. We also intend to involve\r\nourselves fully in cooperation at every level: bilateral,\r\nregional and international.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to stress our special interest\r\nin the debate beginning today, which we expect to end\r\nwith an unequivocal condemnation of terrorism and\r\nwith concrete commitments to fighting it. Not to do so,\r\nand failing to take advantage of the incredible new\r\nawareness of the true nature of terrorism that arose\r\nfrom the tragic events of 11 September, would send the\r\nwrong signal to terrorists and their leaders. We do not\r\nhave the right to fail, out of respect for the hundreds of\r\nthousands of victims of terrorism and out of duty to our\r\nchildren, whom we must protect from this scourge of\r\nmodern times.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): The terrorist attacks\r\nagainst New York and Washington are a crime against\r\nhumanity. I would like to express my deepest sympathy\r\nto the victims, to their families and friends and to the\r\nAmerican people.\r\nTerrorism is a crime against the innocent. The\r\npurpose of terrorism is to spread fear and destruction.\r\nThe random selection of victims is the very essence of\r\nterror; it can strike at any place and at any time.\r\nTerrorism transcends national borders; it strikes at the\r\ncore of the values that we hold to be universal,\r\nindependent of our belief systems and religious\r\naffiliations.\r\nJust as the people of New York stood united in\r\ngrief, bravery and determination, so must we, the\r\ninternational community, stand united in confronting\r\ninternational terrorism. We must bring the criminals\r\nresponsible for these abhorrent acts to justice.\r\nThe killing and maiming of innocent people are\r\nuniversally condemned. That is why an attack against\r\none must be considered as an attack against us all. That\r\nis why we must make the fight against international\r\nterrorism our common cause. International terrorism is\r\na threat to international peace and security.\r\nInternational law confirms the right to self-defence.\r\nNorway is fully committed to contributing to the broad\r\nalliance that is now forming.\r\nOur war on terrorism must be fought on many\r\nfronts. A comprehensive strategy must include military,\r\npolitical, diplomatic, legal and economic means. As the\r\nonly Organization with universal membership and a\r\ncomprehensive agenda, the United Nations must\r\nassume the responsibility for elaborating a broad long-\r\nterm strategy for combating international terrorism.\r\nNorway will participate actively in this work.\r\nIntensified and concerted international efforts are\r\nneeded to effectively seek out and hold accountable\r\nthose who support, harbour and protect terrorists, and\r\nto prevent any future assaults. There can be no\r\nsanctuary for terrorists. We welcome and strongly\r\nsupport Security Council resolution 1368 (2001),\r\nwhich reconfirms the right to individual or collective\r\nself-defence. We further welcome Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), adopted last week, which\r\ncontains clear steps and measures that all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations must now implement in\r\norder to prevent and suppress terrorist activities.\r\nThe competent organs of the United Nations, as\r\nwell as regional organizations, must consolidate and\r\nfurther develop international mechanisms that will\r\nenhance our collective capacity to fight impunity. It is\r\nagainst this background that Norway has called for the\r\nspeedy establishment of the International Criminal\r\nCourt in The Hague.\r\nIt is equally important that the financial networks\r\nfeeding the terrorists are cut off. Norway has ratified\r\nall the United Nations conventions against international\r\nterrorism that are in force. Later today, we will sign the\r\nUnited Nations Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism.\r\nInternational terrorism is also closely linked to\r\norganized crime. The early entry into force of the\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime\r\nwill be important in impairing the financing of terrorist\r\nnetworks. In order to remove this threat, the\r\ninternational community must redouble its efforts\r\naimed at eliminating the known breeding grounds of\r\nterrorism: violent conflict, poverty, intolerance and\r\nreligious fanaticism.\r\nWe must strive for democratization and for\r\nuniversal adherence to human rights. We must redouble\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nour efforts to fight poverty and social exclusion and to\r\npromote good governance. We must move to\r\nimplement the action plan agreed at the Millennium\r\nSummit last year. Globalization must be made into a\r\nvehicle for growth and prosperity for all nations and all\r\npeople.\r\nThe humanitarian tragedy now unfolding in and\r\naround Afghanistan is a direct result of these terrorist\r\nattacks. Our response must include protection of, and\r\nassistance to, the many victims. Norway is considering\r\npositively the United Nations appeal for increased\r\nhumanitarian aid to Afghanistan, to be discussed in\r\nGeneva on Thursday. Norway has also urged the donor\r\ngroup for Afghanistan to mobilize additional resources\r\nto aid the people of Afghanistan.\r\nOut of the ashes — a few blocks from where we\r\nare gathered — we have witnessed the rise of an\r\ninternational coalition of nations truly united in the\r\nquest for peace and security. If the intention of the\r\nterrorists was to split the international community, the\r\nopposite has been achieved. We will not succumb to\r\nterror and fear. We will stand united and we will win\r\nthe war on international terrorism.\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): The start of the new\r\nmillennium has been marred by a tragedy of enormous\r\nproportions. The terrorist attacks of 11 September,\r\naimed primarily against civilians, have become a direct\r\nchallenge not only to the people of the United States,\r\nbut to the entire civilized world. Those responsible\r\nhave put themselves beyond the laws of human\r\ncivilization and deserve a just and inevitable\r\npunishment. Ukraine, together with other nations of the\r\nworld, mourns the victims of the attacks and expresses\r\nits full solidarity with the people of the United States.\r\nBy joining the international anti-terrorist coalition, my\r\ncountry has confirmed its readiness to do its utmost in\r\nthe global effort to eliminate this scourge. I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to reiterate the proposal made\r\nby my delegation to declare the tragic day of 11\r\nSeptember an “International Day to Combat\r\nTerrorism”.\r\nThe brutality and scale of the 11 September\r\nterrorist attacks have profoundly changed our\r\nperception of the global challenges facing mankind.\r\nDespite all the imperfections and built-in weaknesses\r\nof our increasingly globalized world, the international\r\ncommunity cannot afford to remain ill-prepared and ill-\r\nequipped in the face of new threats. Fully\r\nacknowledging the magnitude and implications of the\r\nrecent events, Member States and policy makers must\r\ndevelop new definitions, new terms and new strategies\r\nto stand up to new realities.\r\nLast week the Security Council adopted a historic\r\nresolution designed to enhance the international\r\nresponse to threats of terrorism. It is a timely and\r\nnecessary measure. In our view, its full implementation\r\nwill give a strong impetus to our fight against\r\nterrorism. The complex character of the tasks put\r\nforward by the Council will compel Member States to\r\nconstantly revisit the progress of their implementation.\r\nI am sure that the views expressed during the current\r\ndebate will provide valuable guidance to the Security\r\nCouncil in its further work. It would also be\r\nworthwhile to consider convening a ministerial meeting\r\nof the Council, specifically during the forthcoming\r\ngeneral debate in the Assembly, to discuss the next\r\nsteps.\r\nToday terrorists are using new and sophisticated\r\nmeans to commit their hateful acts. One can imagine\r\nthe consequences if tomorrow they get hold of weapons\r\nof mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical or\r\nbiological, or use computer technologies to disrupt the\r\ndaily activities of society. That could well be the next\r\nstage, and it might bring about a catastrophe of global\r\nproportions. Ukraine therefore considers that the\r\nproblems of the non-proliferation of weapons such as\r\nthose I have mentioned, their means of delivery and\r\nrelated technologies acquire additional significance.\r\nMeasures to combat computer terrorism should also be\r\nproperly reflected in future legal instruments.\r\nUkraine has repeatedly condemned, in the\r\nstrongest possible terms, international terrorism in all\r\nits forms and manifestations. We have consistently\r\nsupported the concerted efforts by the United Nations\r\nto eradicate this crime. My country has ratified most of\r\nthe instruments of universal character in this field. Last\r\nyear, Ukraine signed the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. The\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombing is to be ratified in the near future.\r\nWe consider the adherence and the full implementation\r\nof the relevant international instruments by Member\r\nStates to be an essential contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\r\nalso hope that negotiations on two new universal\r\ninstruments in this field will be concluded shortly. At\r\nthe same time, we realize that legal instruments alone\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nare not sufficient; there is a need for a strong\r\ncommitment by States and genuine cooperation\r\nbetween Governments and their law enforcement\r\nagencies in fighting terrorism.\r\nTerrorist attacks constitute a clear violation of\r\nrecognized norms of international law. Their main\r\npurpose is to undermine international stability and to\r\nprovoke a vicious circle of violence in international or\r\ninter-ethnic relations. The world community should\r\nnot, in any circumstances, give way to such\r\nprovocations. All national and international means of\r\ncombating and suppressing terrorism are necessary\r\ntools that may be used for this purpose.\r\nOf particular concern is the fact that terrorist\r\norganizations are financed through other criminal\r\nactivities, including arms smuggling, drug production\r\nand trafficking, and money laundering. It is regrettable\r\nthat the treatment of these diseases lags far behind the\r\nchallenges they represent. It is our deep conviction that\r\nan increased international effort towards their virtual\r\nelimination would also be instrumental in our fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nWhat happened in New York, Washington, D.C.\r\nand Pennsylvania last month incontestably proves that\r\nno State — big or small, rich or poor — can feel safe\r\nagainst the threat of terrorism, which knows no\r\nboundaries and makes no distinction between children\r\nand military targets, or between diplomatic and\r\nhumanitarian missions. Nor should any State be left\r\nalone in its struggle against terrorism. As the Mayor of\r\nNew York, Rudolph Giuliani, has just mentioned, it is\r\nonly through the concerted efforts of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole that we can effectively\r\nwithstand this challenge.\r\nThe role of this Organization will become even\r\nmore crucial in setting new frameworks for cooperation\r\nin this field. We welcome the recent adoption by the\r\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\r\nof a set of recommendations on specific national and\r\ninternational actions against terrorism. At the same\r\ntime, my delegation is convinced that the enhancing of\r\nthe potential of the United Nations in fighting\r\ninternational terrorism can still go beyond the task of\r\nmerely strengthening the Terrorism Prevention Branch\r\nof the United Nations Office for Drug Control and\r\nCrime Prevention. We continue to maintain that there is\r\na need for proper institutional arrangements to\r\ncoordinate the individual efforts of Member States in\r\ncombating international terrorism and to ensure that the\r\nlegal instruments we elaborated are implemented in the\r\nmost efficient manner. We fully realize that more time\r\nis needed to consider this idea, and we hope that the\r\nAssembly will come back to this matter in due time.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): The decision by the\r\nGeneral Assembly to convene this important meeting\r\nin the aftermath of the recent horrific events in the\r\nUnited States of America is testimony to our collective\r\ndetermination to bring an immediate end to terrorism.\r\nOn behalf of the South African Government and\r\npeople, I wish to extend again our sincerest\r\ncondolences to the Government and people of the\r\nUnited States of America, and to other Governments\r\nand people directly affected by the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\nAs a result of these tragic events, President Thabo\r\nMbeki and the South African cabinet issued a statement\r\non 19 September 2001 reflecting the position of the\r\nSouth African Government, which I would like to read\r\nto you:\r\n“First, South Africa condemns terrorism\r\nwithout any equivocation. Attacks against\r\ncivilians cannot be justified. This approach is\r\nintegral to the humanitarian values that inspired\r\nour struggle and governed its conduct. These\r\nprinciples inform the core values of our\r\nconstitution.\r\n“Secondly, South Africa will cooperate with\r\nall efforts to apprehend the culprits and bring\r\nthem to book. Justice must be done and it must be\r\nseen to be done.\r\n“Thirdly, South Africa therefore recognizes\r\nthe right of the United States Government to track\r\ndown the culprits and bring them to justice. Any\r\naction taken should be informed by thorough\r\ninvestigations and incontrovertible evidence.\r\n“Fourthly, acts of vengeance or mobilization\r\ndirected against individuals, communities or\r\nnations simply because of their faith, language or\r\ncolour cannot be justified. They go against the\r\nhumanitarian and civilized norms that the\r\nterrorists seek to undermine and destroy. They\r\ncan, in fact, play into the hands of these wicked\r\nforces. Whatever the pain the world may be going\r\nthrough, we should avoid temptations of racism,\r\nIslamophobia, anti-Semitism and any other forms\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nof prejudice and discrimination that the recent\r\nWorld Conference against Racism so eloquently\r\nwarned against.\r\n“Fifthly, the world should unite in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. In this effort, the immediate\r\ntask is to ensure that the perpetrators meet their\r\njust desserts. In the medium term, the challenge is\r\nto understand the root causes of these despicable\r\nacts and to eradicate them worldwide.\r\n“Sixthly, in the least, the terrorists should be\r\nisolated through international cooperation to\r\nbuild an equitable world order. This medium-term\r\nchallenge includes concerted efforts to resolve\r\nconflicts in all parts of the globe, including the\r\nsearch for lasting peace in the Middle East. It\r\nincludes a joint commitment throughout the world\r\nto eradicate poverty and underdevelopment.\r\n“The concrete actions are as follows:\r\n“South Africa has, like many other\r\ncountries, offered such support and assistance as\r\nmay be required and within the limits of our\r\ncapacity. Morally and spiritually, we are the\r\nvictims, as well as the people and Government of\r\nthe United States and other nations that lost their\r\ncitizens in these events.\r\n“Government, through its mission in the\r\nUnited States, and working with relevant United\r\nStates authorities, is continuing the search for\r\nSouth Africans who have not as yet been traced,\r\nwho may have been in the hijacked planes or in\r\nthe vicinity of the affected areas.\r\n“To the extent that the current\r\ninvestigations into these acts of terror may\r\nrequire concrete intelligence information that\r\nSouth Africa may have at its disposal, our\r\nsecurity agencies will continue to cooperate with\r\ntheir United States counterparts.\r\n“South Africa has not considered any\r\nmilitary involvement in the operations envisaged\r\nby the United States Administration. The matter\r\nhas not been raised; and, within the context of our\r\napproach to both the immediate and longer-term\r\nchallenges in dealing with the scourge of\r\nterrorism, the issue does not arise.\r\n“South Africa will take part in discussions\r\non the course of world action on this issue, within\r\nthe context of regional and other multilateral\r\norganizations to which we belong, including the\r\nUnited Nations. Further, working together with\r\nother countries within the United Nations system,\r\nwe will continue to make our contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of relevant international\r\nconventions on the fight against terrorism.\r\n“Our approach to this matter is informed by\r\nour values as a nation; and Government is of the\r\nfull conviction that it is in the national interest.”\r\nSouth Africa, like all United Nations Members, is\r\nstill examining the very wide-ranging implications of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), which was\r\nadopted over the weekend.\r\nIn closing, let me take this opportunity to\r\nreiterate that South Africa is committed to working\r\nclosely with the Security Council and with the United\r\nNations General Assembly in order to ensure a\r\nconcerted response to the challenge of seeking\r\nappropriate means to eliminate the common scourge of\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): We\r\nare all honoured that Mayor Giuliani joined the\r\nSecretary-General and ourselves to open the debate this\r\nmorning and to inspire us with his call for unity against\r\nterrorism. Though we in this Assembly come from all\r\nquarters of the globe, New York is our — the United\r\nNations — city. We suffer with, and for, the victims of\r\n11 September and their families: New Yorkers,\r\nAmericans and citizens of more than 80 other\r\ncountries. And we pay tribute to the heroes who gave\r\ntheir lives trying to save others.\r\nAs Prime Minister Blair told the British\r\nParliament three days later, the crime of 11 September\r\nwas\r\n“an act of wickedness for which there can never\r\nbe justification. Whatever the cause, whatever the\r\nperversion of religious feeling, whatever the\r\npolitical belief, to inflict such terror on the world,\r\nto take the lives of so many innocent and\r\ndefenceless men, women and children can never\r\nbe justified”.\r\nWith the smoke still rising from the ruins of the\r\nWorld Trade Center, we must now act quickly,\r\nresolutely and collectively to make sure such outrages\r\nare prevented in future. Terrorists operate without\r\nregard for borders or the citizenship of their victims\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nand so the fight against terrorism has to be a global\r\none. Organizing this global response must be central to\r\nour efforts at the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council has already responded.\r\nFirst, in resolution 1368 (2001), to condemn the recent\r\nattacks as attacks on the United States and on\r\ninternational peace and security, and to express the\r\nCouncil’s readiness to take steps in response. Secondly,\r\nin its ambitious resolution 1373 (2001), to set out the\r\nmeasures which we must all now take to prevent and\r\ncombat terrorists wherever they are found. We must all\r\ntake steps, nationally and jointly, to prevent the flow of\r\nfinance and funds to terrorists; to stop terrorists from\r\ncrossing borders; to apprehend them; to put them on\r\ntrial or extradite them to countries that will put them on\r\ntrial; to share information; and to cease to tolerate\r\nStates or entities that support or protect terrorists.\r\nBut this is just the start. Now it is time for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to act. While we, as the Members of\r\nthe United Nations, must act collectively through the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, we as\r\nMember States must also act nationally and\r\nindividually. The United Kingdom strongly supports\r\nthe Secretary-General’s call this morning for a broad\r\ncoalition against terrorism. Encouraged and\r\ncoordinated by the work of the General Assembly,\r\nevery State should ratify the existing 12 United Nations\r\nand international conventions against terrorism, in\r\nparticular the United Nations Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which the\r\nUnited Kingdom ratified in February 2001. Secondly,\r\nwork must be accelerated on the draft global terrorism\r\nand nuclear terrorism conventions, which are under\r\nnegotiation here in the General Assembly. We should\r\nset firm benchmarks for a conclusion of the\r\nnegotiations. As a first step, the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nshould report by mid-November on progress in\r\nnegotiating the global convention. And the Assembly\r\nshould take stock again itself before the end of the\r\nyear. Thirdly, we must each take steps to ensure that\r\nthose responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring\r\nterrorists are held accountable. Fourthly, we must each\r\nreinforce and extend international cooperation\r\narrangements in the field of justice, policing and law\r\nenforcement.\r\nThis is a considerable agenda for the Assembly,\r\nover and above the obligations set out in Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001). A road map is taking\r\nshape for each individual Member State. All States owe\r\nit to the victims of the terrorist atrocities to implement\r\nthese measures. A number of them are already in force\r\nin the United Kingdom through the Terrorism Act\r\n2000, the United Kingdom’s tough anti-terrorism law\r\npassed in February of this year. We are, nonetheless,\r\nconsidering urgently what further changes in domestic\r\nlegislation may be required in responding to resolution\r\n1373 (2001). We will certainly be willing also to\r\nrespond to the Secretary-General’s call this morning to\r\nassist others to react swiftly to that resolution and to\r\ndevelop the cooperative effort necessary.\r\nNational efforts must, however, be welded into a\r\nglobal framework. With our partners in the European\r\nUnion, we will pursue collective European action\r\nacross all our territories, as the earlier address of the\r\nrepresentative of Belgium set out on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. The agreement of the European\r\nUnion’s Economic and Finance Ministers to rapid and\r\ncoordinated initiatives to combat the financing of\r\nterrorism will in itself be an upfront contribution to\r\nmeeting the objectives of resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nBefore concluding, let me touch on one\r\ncontroversial area where this Assembly has a job to do.\r\nIncreasingly, questions are being raised about the\r\nproblem of the definition of a terrorist. Let us be wise\r\nand focused about this. Terrorism is terrorism. It uses\r\nviolence to kill and damage indiscriminately to make a\r\npolitical or cultural point and to influence legitimate\r\nGovernments or public opinion unfairly and amorally.\r\nThere is common ground among all of us on what\r\nconstitutes terrorism. What looks, smells and kills like\r\nterrorism is terrorism. Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001) sets out clear, urgent and acceptable measures\r\nfor every Member State to deal with it, collectively,\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nBut there are also wars and armed struggles\r\nwhere actions can be characterized, for metaphorical\r\nand rhetorical force, as terrorist. This is a highly\r\ncontroversial and subjective area, on which, because of\r\nthe legitimate spectrum of viewpoints within the\r\nUnited Nations membership, we will never reach full\r\nconsensus.\r\nWar in human history has, for the most part,\r\nthank goodness, engaged human honour: there are\r\nrules. At the edges, dishonourable actions may share\r\nsome of the characteristics of terrorism. Let the corpus\r\nof international humanitarian law deal with that. Our\r\njob now is to confront and eradicate terrorism pure and\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nsimple: the use of violence without honour,\r\ndiscrimination or regard for human decency. In\r\nfollowing up the implementation of Friday’s Security\r\nCouncil resolution, the 1373 Committee must focus on\r\nwhat we all agree is terrorism without subjective\r\ninterpretation, and filter out prejudice and\r\nunilateralism. That will be the approach of the United\r\nKingdom.\r\nOne last point. There is a humanitarian crisis in\r\nAfghanistan, made worse by the instability engendered\r\nby the attacks of 11 September. Already severe, the\r\ncrisis is likely to get worse in the coming weeks. The\r\npeople of Afghanistan have already suffered too much\r\nfrom the appalling Taliban regime. Our justified focus\r\nin combating terrorism must not divert us from acting\r\nto help the Afghan people when they need us. The\r\nUnited Kingdom has in recent days disbursed $40\r\nmillion to this cause, and more is in the pipeline. I urge\r\nevery one of us to support the Secretary-General’s\r\nappeal for funds, not with pledges, but with cash now.\r\nThat need, too, is acute and urgent.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nIt is clear that the General Assembly decided to hold a\r\nspecific debate today on terrorism because of the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001, whose universal\r\nconsequences and repercussions will long affect the\r\nhuman conscience.\r\nIt is often said that repetition is confirmation. My\r\ncountry wishes to reiterate to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States, and more generally to the\r\ncountries and families that are also victims of this\r\ntragedy, its great sorrow and profound compassion.\r\nIn the face of such a disaster, it is hardly\r\nnecessary to recall the importance and the relevance of\r\nour debate today. From the outset, it is fitting to recall\r\nthat this is not the first time the international\r\ncommunity has had to address the question of\r\nterrorism. In fact, the first international Convention on\r\nterrorism dates back to 1963. So far 171 countries — in\r\nother words, almost all the Member States of our\r\nOrganization — have become parties to that\r\nConvention, signed in Tokyo, whose objective is to\r\ncombat offences and certain other acts committed on\r\nboard aircraft. Many other conventions, such as those\r\nof The Hague, Montreal, New York, Rome, Vienna and\r\nso forth, have strengthened the legal arsenal established\r\nin order to thwart international terrorism. In addition to\r\nthose preventive legal measures, the question regularly\r\nappears on the agenda of the Sixth Committee.\r\nUnfortunately, it must be recognized that, even with\r\nsuch a structure in place, what we are dealing with is a\r\nshadowy, changing phenomenon, which recalls the\r\nmyth of Sisyphus, for the fight against terrorism\r\nrequires eternally starting again.\r\nIn fact, despite all the Draconian measures taken\r\nin airports, on aircraft and ships, in diplomatic\r\npremises and elsewhere, terrorists operate with\r\nparticularly disconcerting ease and even sophistication.\r\nThe commanders and the operators seem together to\r\nhave designed strategies and methods that our societies\r\ncannot stop. Worse, a new type of terrorism has just\r\nemerged that is as dangerous as it is treacherous: the\r\nsuicide attack. The struggle against this kind of terror\r\nis yet more formidable.\r\nWe are well aware of this. More than two weeks\r\nafter the tragic events, the United States and the world\r\ncoalition against terrorism are still hesitating, because\r\nit is difficult to identify the real originators, and they\r\ndo not know precisely against whom to take reprisals.\r\nEven if the guilty were clearly identified, how is it\r\npossible to get to them without hitting innocent people?\r\nThe futility of the anti-missile shield is becoming\r\nobvious, since no State, even the most powerful, can\r\nfeel protected, certain of invulnerability. The anti-\r\nmissile shield is conceivable as long as the missiles\r\ncome directly from outside, from an adversary in a\r\nspecific geographical location or one that is clearly\r\nidentifiable. But when that adversary attacks from\r\nwithin the victim’s territory, using its own\r\ninfrastructures, as was the case on 11 September, the\r\ncounter-offensive is rarely productive. What can really\r\nbe done against someone who considers death to be the\r\njust price of a mission accepted as a vocation and as a\r\nguarantee of eternal happiness?\r\nThe big question before us today, therefore, is\r\nwhat can be done to eradicate an elusive evil.\r\nIn our humble opinion, the first requirement is\r\nthat all States have the same definition and the same\r\nunderstanding of terrorism. Unfortunately, what do we\r\nsee? Depending on their interests, States do not have\r\nthe same concept or the same view of terrorism and of\r\nrelations with terrorists. What is described as a terrorist\r\nact in one State will be interpreted as a nationalist\r\nclaim in another. Does that mean that we are to believe\r\nthat there are good and bad terrorists? The need to\r\nspeak the same language is therefore the sine qua non\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nfor victory over international terrorism, because for\r\nthis struggle to be effective it can brook no exception\r\nor compromise. From this standpoint, it seems that the\r\ntragedy of 11 September has harmonized and unified\r\nviews.\r\nThe second lesson to be learned is that the\r\nterrorist phenomenon cannot be effectively combated\r\nwithout a broad-based anti-terrorist fight; in other\r\nwords, with international cooperation in all areas —\r\npolitical, economic, financial, legislative, legal and so\r\nforth. That presupposes as a first obligation that all\r\nStates adhere to the various international treaties and\r\nprotocols on terrorism. Such unanimity would greatly\r\ncontribute to defusing the terrorist bomb.\r\nI wish also to place emphasis on the preventive\r\nstruggle, which requires cooperation in information\r\ngathering and investigation. In our globalized world,\r\nnational interests cannot be conceived in isolation.\r\nUnder United Nations auspices, a very high-level\r\nconference could be convened to explore all\r\npossibilities for an effective fight against this evil of\r\nthe century.\r\nLastly, it seems to us that the international\r\ncommunity must take fully into account the human\r\ndimension of the problem. Suicide attacks are clearly\r\nthe expression of a despair linked to certain\r\nfrustrations, such as a sense of injustice, imprisonment\r\nin poverty and powerlessness in the face of arrogance\r\nand repression. Psychologists tell us that the act of\r\ncompensating for such frustrations knows no scruples.\r\nIt is therefore obviously the humanization of\r\ninternational relations that is called for. We must see to\r\nit that the less powerful and those left aside are also\r\nconsidered and respected. Let us therefore work\r\ntowards the building of a more just and humane world.\r\nIf others feel that they are heard and understood, there\r\nwill be no reason for them to take the path of violence.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that\r\nBurkina Faso is prepared, together with the other\r\nnations of the world, to categorically say no to\r\nterrorism and to close off the terrorists’ path once and\r\nfor all.\r\nMr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): We\r\nwelcome the decision of the most representative body\r\nof the United Nations and your personal efforts,\r\nMr. President, to place the fight against international\r\nterrorism among the main and most urgent items on the\r\nagenda. There is no doubt that this will allow us to\r\ndefine the most effective and timely steps for\r\ncounteracting any manifestations of terrorism in the\r\nmodern world.\r\nThe shock caused by the barbarity and cruelty of\r\nthe acts of terrorism committed in New York,\r\nWashington and Pennsylvania on 11 September this\r\nyear will long remain a part of the everyday life of\r\npeoples of the civilized world. The acts of terrorism in\r\nthe United States took many innocent civilian victims\r\nand constituted a challenge to the entire international\r\ncommunity by those who are striving to rule the world\r\nand achieve political, religious, ethnic and other goals\r\nwith terror and force, in violation of the main\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nThe people, President and Government of the\r\nRepublic of Belarus immediately responded to the\r\ntragic events, sharing in the general grief of the\r\nAmerican people and sincerely offering their\r\ncondolences to the families of the people who died as a\r\nresult of the recent events.\r\nIt is important that the grief of humankind and\r\nmemory of lost lives form the basis for efficient\r\nmeasures to be taken by the international community\r\nagainst acts of international terrorism, which have\r\nbecome a shocking reality of the modern world. We are\r\nconvinced that the United Nations, as a unique and the\r\nlargest forum of nations, must take the lead in the\r\nprocess of devising such measures. We are convinced\r\nthat only under such conditions will there be the\r\nnecessary restraint and responsibility for the future of\r\ncivilization, in full observance of the Charter, which\r\nthe overwhelming majority of world’s States has\r\npromised to respect. The collective wisdom of the\r\nUnited Nations, which takes into consideration the\r\nopinions and experience of various peoples and is\r\nbased on the constructive dialogue of civilizations, will\r\nallow us to come up with the necessary measures under\r\nthe present circumstances.\r\nBelarus is convinced that the response of the\r\ninternational community should be directed at the\r\nperpetrators and organizers of the acts of terrorism that\r\nwere committed — terrorist organizations and their\r\nsponsors, not entire countries and peoples. Only such\r\nan approach will allow us to avoid the loss of more\r\ncivilian victims and make the process of responding a\r\nmanaged and therefore predictable one. The decision to\r\nuse military force in response to the terrorist activities\r\nof certain States, if there is sufficient proof of their\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\ncarrying out and promoting such activities, must be\r\nwell founded and in accordance with provisions of the\r\nCharter. The possibility of any military intervention to\r\ncombat international terrorism on the territories of\r\nother States today can and must be considered from the\r\npoint of view of threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, exclusively by the Security Council, which\r\nhas been given authority for this under the Charter.\r\nBelarus welcomes the steps that have already been\r\ntaken in this field by the Council and supports the\r\nprovisions of resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September,\r\none of whose measures provides for the establishment\r\nof a Committee of the Security Council to combat\r\nterrorism. We believe that this measure, together with\r\nother measures provided for under the resolution, will\r\nmake it possible to create a necessary, permanent,\r\neffective mechanism of the Security Council for\r\nfighting terrorism. Such a mechanism should begin to\r\nfunction as quickly as possible if the work of the\r\nCouncil as a whole is to be effective.\r\nThe events in the largest cities of the United\r\nStates of America confirm the deep concern about the\r\nincreasing scope of the means of spreading acts of\r\nterrorism in the world. The acquisition by terrorists of\r\nnew types of weapons and advanced scientific and\r\ntechnological means, as well as the internalization of\r\nmany aspects of international life, lead to\r\ncircumstances under which international terrorism is\r\nbecoming a global problem of the modern world and\r\none of the main threats to the peaceful development of\r\nhumankind in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus, which has suffered\r\ngreatly several times in its history from the\r\nconsequences of treacherous attacks and wars,\r\nresolutely condemns international terrorism, including\r\nState terrorism, and consistently advocates expanding\r\ncooperation to combat this social ill, which cannot be\r\njustified under any circumstances. For Belarus, which\r\nis situated at the crossroads of the main European and\r\nworld trade routes, the problem of fighting terrorism\r\nhas an everyday, practical dimension.\r\nOur State is a party to all the main international\r\ntreaties on the struggle against terrorism that are\r\ncurrently in force. The Republic of Belarus undertook\r\nthe appropriate steps to become a party to two new\r\nUnited Nations conventions in the field — the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings and the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. It is\r\ndeeply symbolic that just today, 1 October, the\r\nRepublic of Belarus deposited with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral its instrument of ratification of the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings. The Republic of Belarus plans to\r\nsign the International Convention for the Suppression\r\nof the Financing of Terrorism during this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Foreign-policy support for the anti-\r\nterrorist struggle is harmoniously being carried out and\r\ncoordinated with the domestic policy of the Belarusian\r\nState on combating terrorism and crime in general,\r\nwhich is based on progressive international experience.\r\nFrom this podium, we associate ourselves with\r\nthe appeal to States that have not yet done so to\r\nbecome parties to all the anti-terrorist conventions. We\r\nare convinced that the implementation of these\r\nconventions by the overwhelming majority of States\r\nwill provide an opportunity to organize action against\r\nterrorism throughout the world and contribute to its\r\nelimination.\r\nTo increase the efficacy of the implementation of\r\nthe anti-terrorist conventions and to involve the United\r\nNations more broadly in suppressing terrorism, we\r\nconsider it worthwhile to establish, on the basis of an\r\nappropriate resolution of the General Assembly, a\r\nUnited Nations centre for combating terrorism, with\r\nresponsibility for ensuring that States parties fulfil their\r\nobligations within the framework of these treaties and\r\nalso, through the Secretary-General, giving them help\r\nin promoting collaboration on preventing and fighting\r\nterrorism. We propose that such a centre have special\r\nsubdivisions for preventing terrorism and for fact-\r\nfinding, as well as for operational responses to terrorist\r\nactivities.\r\nThe establishment of such an anti-terrorist centre\r\nby the General Assembly, which is composed of all the\r\nMembers of the United Nations, would be a substantial\r\naddition to the measures undertaken by the Security\r\nCouncil in combating terrorism and would promote the\r\nbroadest interaction possible within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations on the issue. The General Assembly\r\nhas the necessary authority, under Article 11 of the\r\nCharter, to take such a decision.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Committee established by General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/210 on 17 December 1996,\r\nwhich is also preparing a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism, would be a proper forum to\r\ndiscuss the above initiative.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nThe Republic of Belarus would like to express its\r\nhope that, in the light of the terrible events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001, the Ad Hoc Committee will\r\naccelerate the preparation of the draft comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism and make\r\nprogress in setting dates to convene a high-level\r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations to\r\nadopt the comprehensive convention and to formulate a\r\njoint organized response on the part of the international\r\ncommunity to combat terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to say that, in our\r\nview, the fight against terrorism will be effective only\r\nif the international community adheres to the following\r\nmain approaches.\r\nFirst, terrorism is a negative social phenomenon\r\nand is unjustifiable on any grounds, be it on political,\r\nreligious, ethnic or any other grounds. It will be\r\nuniversally condemned.\r\nSecondly, individuals guilty of organizing,\r\ncommitting and financing acts of terrorism must\r\ninevitably be punished. That also includes extradition\r\nto States with grounds to prosecute those persons in\r\naccordance with their criminal laws.\r\nThirdly, peacekeeping operations are needed in\r\nall regions of the world to prevent conflicts that give\r\nrise to acts of terrorism.\r\nFourthly, countermeasures against terrorism will\r\ncomply strictly with the United Nations Charter and\r\nnorms of international law.\r\nFifthly, cooperation and mutual confidence will\r\nbe strengthened among countries to eliminate\r\nterrorism.\r\nSixthly, there should be universal adherence to\r\nexisting treaties to combat internal terrorism. New\r\ntreaties should also be developed at the multilateral,\r\nregional and bilateral levels.\r\nWe are convinced that, given the consensus in the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the steps taken by the Security\r\nCouncil, there are grounds to be optimistic about the\r\nimplementation of these measures. The Government of\r\nthe Republic of Belarus will contribute to that to the\r\nmaximum extent possible.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is meeting today under the shadow\r\nof the horrific tragedy that continues to loom large over\r\nthis great city and, in fact, over the skies of this\r\nfriendly country and, I might add, the skies of the\r\nentire world. We condemn that crime. The criminal\r\nterrorist acts have highlighted shortcomings to us in\r\nEgypt, both with regard to the new measures that the\r\ninternational community must put in place and with\r\nregard to old measures that must be taken out of\r\nmothballs to reinvigorate ways and means to combat\r\nand root out terrorism.\r\nThose acts have also proven that all States and\r\npeoples, irrespective of their political systems or\r\ngeographic locations, are vulnerable to terrorist attacks.\r\nThose who struck the World Trade Center and other\r\ntargets did not injure the United States and its people\r\nalone. They committed murder against the nationals of\r\nover 60 States, including Egypt. Furthermore, the\r\nattacks violated the principles observed by the\r\ninternational community and all of humanity, principles\r\nenshrined in all religions and cultures, especially in the\r\nIslamic faith.\r\nToday we are debating the agenda item entitled\r\n“Measures to eliminate international terrorism”, as well\r\nas discussing the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthose measures. In that regard, I would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report. We note with\r\nsatisfaction his efforts to carry out the functions\r\nmandated to him by the General Assembly in\r\ncombating terrorism. We would like to refer in\r\nparticular to his efforts to ensure coordination between\r\nthe specialized agencies of the United Nations and\r\nother international organizations.\r\nWe would also like to express our satisfaction\r\nwith the contents of the report regarding the increasing\r\nnumber of States that have signed, ratified or acceded\r\nto conventions to combat terrorism. We take this\r\nopportunity to invite States that have not yet done so to\r\nfollow that example, in an effort to ensure that the legal\r\ninstruments to combat terrorism attain universality. I\r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to recall that\r\nEgypt has submitted data for all Member States\r\nregarding the measures it has taken at the national,\r\nregional and international levels to prevent and\r\nsuppress international terrorism.\r\nEgypt was one of the leading States to sound the\r\nalarm of the advent of the new criminal phenomenon of\r\ninternational terrorism on the international scene.\r\nEgypt led, and continues to lead, a long and sustained\r\ncampaign against terrorism at all levels.\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nIn the national sphere, Egypt spared no\r\nadministrative or legislative efforts to suppress\r\nterrorism by enforcing national plans at the cultural,\r\nsocial, economic and security levels. Regionally, Egypt\r\nwas a driving force behind the conclusion of the Arab\r\nConvention on the Suppression of Terrorism and the\r\ntwo conventions to combat international terrorism\r\nadopted within the framework of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC). At the international level,\r\nEgypt has signed, ratified or acceded to 14\r\ninternational and regional agreements, all of which are\r\nconsidered enforceable domestic law in my country.\r\nEgypt also participates actively in all ongoing\r\nnegotiations aimed at drafting new provisions to\r\nsuppress this heinous phenomenon.\r\nThe Security Council adopted an enormously\r\nsignificant resolution on the evening of 28 September,\r\none that enjoyed the unanimous approval of the\r\nmembers of the Council. We support its provisions and\r\ngeneral framework. We shall follow closely reactions\r\nand analyses in that regard and monitor the moves of\r\nthe Council in its methodology and implementation of\r\nthe resolution.\r\nIn particular, our attention was drawn to the\r\naffirmation in the resolution — which we support — to\r\nrefrain from providing safe haven to fugitives\r\nimplicated in acts of terrorism. We were also struck by\r\nthe provision that maintains that claims of political\r\nmotivation are not recognized as grounds for refusing\r\nrequests for the extradition of alleged terrorists. Egypt\r\nhas had bitter experiences with regard to that particular\r\npoint. For quite some time, Egypt has cautioned against\r\nharbouring fugitive terrorists wanted under the\r\njurisdiction of our laws. Unfortunately, we see today\r\nthe invalidity of the positions and approaches of the\r\nStates that denied extradition. It is our great hope that\r\nall States will comply fully with all the provisions of\r\nthe resolution.\r\nBut we continue to have serious questions about\r\nthe resolution that we must pursue. One has to do with\r\nthe components of the mandate given to the Committee\r\ncharged with implementation formed under the\r\nresolution. What are the mechanisms, mandates and\r\npowers of that Committee? What is the dividing line\r\nbetween its role in monitoring and its ability to act?\r\nWhat are the implications of the resolution on the\r\nseries of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council itself in this regard, not to\r\nmention international conventions dealing with the\r\nissue? There are many other points that will require\r\nclarification, especially with regard to the contractual\r\nobligations in place among States under other\r\ninternational laws and national legislation. We have\r\nlistened closely and with appreciation to the statement\r\nmade by the representative of the United Kingdom in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe war against terrorism requires an enormously\r\nwide range of tools in the legal, economic, social and\r\ncultural spheres, to name but a few. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the political dimensions and root causes\r\nof terrorism must be at the centre of our focus if\r\ninternational action against this pernicious evil is to be\r\neffective.\r\nUnambiguously, candidly, sincerely and without\r\nequivocation, I wish to stress that the question of\r\nPalestine is first among the political and humanitarian\r\nissues that must be at the centre of our efforts. That\r\nquestion must be settled in a fair manner that restores\r\nthe legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people.\r\nLet me add that the thinking among certain parties in\r\nIsrael that there is now an opportunity to crush\r\nPalestinian resistance to occupation by taking advantage\r\nof the conditions now gripping the entire world is a\r\ngrave mistake that would have incalculable\r\nimplications and dire consequences.\r\nUsing the religion or culture of Islam to justify\r\nterrorist crimes that harm innocent people is a cause for\r\ndeep distress. But it is truly harmful, regrettable and\r\ndisturbing that some groups and circles have quickly\r\nseized on these criminal terrorist acts to stigmatize a\r\nparticular culture or civilization by name, or even to\r\nclaim that one culture is superior to others. There is\r\nmuch that we could say on that subject, but I do not\r\nwish to diverge from the subject of today’s debate. We\r\nintend, however, to address this issue at the appropriate\r\ntime, and our carefully considered presentation will\r\noutline the depth of experience of civilizations, and the\r\nconstructive role of dialogue among cultures.\r\nIn the wake of these perilous events, the President\r\nof Egypt, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, reiterated Egypt’s\r\ninitiative related to the convening within the\r\nframework of the United Nations of an international\r\nconference on terrorism. There is no doubt that world\r\nleaders’ attendance at such a summit, at the proper\r\ntime, with a view to sending a clear message in the\r\nfight against terrorism and to adopting a full range of\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nmeasures to eradicate that phenomenon, which spares\r\nno society, would be a great contribution to the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. It is time for the General Assembly,\r\nat this session, to adopt a resolution reviving the idea\r\nof such a conference, enacting measures to prepare for\r\nconvening it at the proper time, and earnestly engaging\r\nin the preparatory work, which we believe would take\r\nsome time. The most important thing now is to work in\r\nearnest to translate these ideas into reality.\r\nIn conclusion, we appreciate the importance of\r\ncooperation and coordination towards a systematic,\r\ncollective, effective response in the United Nations\r\nframework, through a broad consensus on eradicating\r\nterrorism, and we call on all States to follow the\r\nexample of those States that have already committed\r\nthemselves to rooting out terrorism. Perhaps this\r\nsession of the General Assembly will be an opportune\r\noccasion to begin an intense dialogue that will\r\ncontribute to creating an integrated collective system to\r\ncombat terrorism in the political, economic,\r\ntechnological and legal spheres, and to address the root\r\ncauses that provide fertile soil for the spread of this\r\nphenomenon.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): On 11 September,\r\nwhile we were praying for global peace at an\r\ninternational prayer breakfast right here at United\r\nNations Headquarters in New York, the twin towers\r\nwere deliberately targeted and brought down. The\r\npeace bell that the Secretary-General should have rung\r\nthat day remained silent. The next day it rang in\r\nmemory of the unknown number of victims of the\r\nterrorist attacks. The terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nwere inflicted on parents, children, spouses, friends,\r\nneighbours, employees and citizens from more than 80\r\nnations, some of them of Croatian ethnic origin as well.\r\nThat crime against humanity, aimed at killing as many\r\nunknown persons as possible, was committed by a\r\nbrutal and organized terrorist network.\r\nMy country recently went through war. The shock\r\nof unselective killings coupled with physical\r\ndestruction, and the pictures of missing persons, are,\r\nunfortunately, all too familiar to us. However, this did\r\nnot make us less, but rather more sensitive to the\r\ncrimes committed in New York, Washington, D.C., and\r\nPennsylvania. Once again we express our deepest\r\ncondolences and profound solidarity to the families of\r\nthe victims, to the American people and to the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America. Croatia is\r\nfully committed to fight terrorism until its\r\nextermination is complete.\r\nThe perpetrators of these crimes must be brought\r\nto justice and prevented from causing another tragedy.\r\nOur Charter indicates that terrorism is a threat to\r\ninternational peace and that every country has the\r\nsolemn right to defend itself, its citizens and their\r\npeace and security. Therefore, such a right on the part\r\nthe United States should not be questioned. Yet, as the\r\nSecretary-General put it so eloquently in his op-ed\r\narticle in The New York Times of 21 September 2001,\r\n“The terrorists who attacked the United States on\r\nSeptember 11 aimed at one nation but wounded an\r\nentire world”. So the response to these acts should\r\ncome from all over the world. Our motto in this\r\nchallenging task should be: multilateralism against\r\nterrorism. We should set aside many of our differences\r\nand concentrate on a common goal: the global\r\neradication of terrorism, once and for all.\r\nWhat is the key role of the United Nations in this\r\nendeavour, and what can we expect from this debate?\r\nWe strongly support the Secretary-General’s view that\r\nthe United Nations is uniquely positioned to advance\r\nthe common fight against terrorism. Individual\r\ncountries will be fighting terrorism in different ways,\r\nand will be entering different regional or other\r\ncoalitions and arrangements against terrorism.\r\nHowever, it is vital to show that there is a clear\r\ncommon denominator against terrorism, and that basic\r\nvalues and commitments against terrorism are shared\r\nby all. The President of Croatia recently launched an\r\nappeal to make these core values and principles of the\r\nglobal coalition against terrorism transparent and\r\nexplicit.\r\nThe fight against terrorism will be long and\r\ncomplex. We have to prosecute terrorists wherever they\r\nare, cut their financing and isolate countries that are\r\naiding, supporting or harbouring them. To ensure the\r\nlong-term eradication of terrorism, however, the fight\r\nagainst it must be accompanied by a fight against\r\nconditions which favour the spread of terrorism, such\r\nas long-lasting conflicts, unresolved crises, inequality,\r\npoverty, ignorance and injustice. Our overall success,\r\ntherefore, relies heavily on coordinated efforts on the\r\npart of the principal organs of the United Nations,\r\nnamely the General Assembly, the Security Council\r\nand the Economic and Social Council.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.12\r\nWe do not have much time. Our condemnation of\r\nterrorism should be swiftly transformed into practical\r\nsteps against it. The 12 United Nations conventions\r\nagainst terrorism already provide a good framework for\r\nthe prosecution and extradition of offenders and against\r\nmoney laundering. The Security Council resolution that\r\nwas recently adopted will provide a major new impetus\r\nto this process, not only by taking a further step\r\ntowards defining the obligations of countries in their\r\ncooperation against terrorism under Chapter VII, but\r\nalso by establishing a mechanism for monitoring\r\nnational implementation.\r\nThe Government of Croatia welcomes this far-\r\nreaching anti-terrorist resolution and intends to speed\r\nup ratification of the relevant United Nations anti-\r\nterrorist conventions to which it is not yet a party. It\r\nalso expresses its readiness to fully cooperate in the\r\nimplementation of various anti-terrorist international\r\ninstruments and in practical activities to eradicate\r\nterrorism.\r\nCroatia, as a party to the Rome Statute, also\r\nsupports the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of\r\nEurope in its view that the new International Criminal\r\nCourt is the appropriate institution to consider terrorist\r\nacts, when needed. With the establishment of a\r\npermanent International Criminal Court now in sight, it\r\nis encouraging to know that, even in the absence of an\r\nadequate response from some States, the international\r\ncommunity will have the means to bring the\r\nperpetrators of these specific crimes against humanity\r\nto justice. The ongoing International Criminal Court\r\nPreparatory Committee is a welcome opportunity to\r\ndiscuss these pertinent legal issues.\r\nMy Government is committed to the fight against\r\nterrorism as an international evil, regardless of its\r\nperpetrators. Any attempt to equate terrorism with\r\nspecific religious or ethnic groups is totally\r\nunacceptable to us. Throughout history, terrorists have\r\ncalled upon different religions or ideologies to embrace\r\nand justify their crimes.\r\nTerrorism has always threatened humankind, but\r\ngiven current technological and scientific\r\ndevelopments, the magnitude of the threat we face\r\ntoday is unprecedented. We were prevented from\r\nconvening the special session of the General Assembly\r\non children this September because of the terrorist\r\nattacks. Nevertheless, we now have a chance to do\r\nsomething of utmost importance for the future of our\r\nchildren: to commit ourselves to leave them a world\r\nfree of terrorism. It will be a long and arduous battle,\r\nbut our children’s future rests upon it.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
