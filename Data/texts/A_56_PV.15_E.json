(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 166 (continued)\r\nMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/160 and\r\nCorr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Pradhan (Bhutan): The General Assembly\r\nmeets this year under exceptionally grave\r\ncircumstances in New York to consider the agenda item\r\non terrorism. Hence, allow me at the outset to join\r\nother speakers in thanking The Honourable Rudolph\r\nGiuliani, Mayor of New York, for having taken time\r\nfrom his exceedingly difficult and busy responsibilities\r\nand call of duty to make a historic visit to the United\r\nNations and address the General Assembly. My\r\ndelegation, like many others, was moved by his appeal\r\nto the international community to fight unambiguously\r\nagainst terrorism. The impact that he made was\r\nimmense. We thank the Mayor for his outstanding\r\nleadership of our host city and the effective and\r\nhumane manner in which he is conducting the rescue\r\nand recovery operations at ground zero. This is indeed\r\nthe darkest hour in the history of our host city, and the\r\nMayor’s leadership has been nothing short of crucial.\r\nAt the start of our deliberations on terrorism, my\r\ndelegation would like to once again convey the deepest\r\ncondolences of the Government and the people of\r\nBhutan to the Government and the people of the United\r\nStates for the tragedy of 11 September. The terrorist\r\nattacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon and the\r\ncrash of the hijacked aeroplane in Pennsylvania have\r\nleft all of us shocked and horrified.\r\nIt is gratifying that in these most trying of times,\r\nwe, the Member States of the United Nations, are\r\ncoming together and mobilizing our efforts in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. While the international legal\r\nframework is being established and built upon,\r\ncooperation in intelligence, intensification of\r\nintelligence gathering, sharing and analysing\r\ninformation and timely pre-emptive action will go a\r\nlong way in preventing terrorist acts. This is something\r\nwe have to now undertake vigorously and with the\r\ngreatest of unity.\r\nThen there is the long-term war against terrorism.\r\nBut the question is, how do we go about it? This is\r\nobviously a very difficult task and may even sometimes\r\nseem elusive. This war against terrorism, as the United\r\nStates President, Mr. George W. Bush put it, has to be\r\nfought on several fronts.\r\nOne of the major fronts would be the fight against\r\nextremist beliefs and organizations that justify their\r\nviolence and killings on the basis of political and,\r\nunfortunately, distorted religious grounds. Such\r\njustifications, again, regrettably attract support and\r\nsympathy among groups in some countries that may\r\neven subscribe to, aid and abet, maintain silence about\r\nor turn a blind eye to such activities in view of political\r\nor other pressures.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nWhen it comes to terrorism, we are most\r\nconcerned with beliefs and mindsets involved in\r\nterrorist acts leading to the destruction of innocent\r\nlives and the peaceful functioning of the economic,\r\nsocial, cultural and political aspects of societies.\r\nWe are apprehensive that peaceful coexistence, a\r\nfundamental principle of the United Nations Charter\r\nand the Non-Aligned Movement, will be cast to the\r\nwinds. We are concerned with the survival and the\r\ncontinuance of all of the world’s civilizations that we\r\ncherish. We are worried that the economic development\r\ninto which we are putting our hearts and minds in an\r\neffort to remove poverty, fight the worldwide scourge\r\nof HIV/AIDS and raise the living standards of our\r\npeople will be seriously jeopardized. Above all, we\r\nsubscribe to peaceful coexistence and tolerance. We\r\ndemand no less from other nations and peoples.\r\nThe investigations carried out thus far by the\r\nUnited States and other countries and organizations\r\nreveal how deep the tentacles of terror have spread\r\naround the world. Its strength and reach, and more\r\nsurprising, the human beings who are willing to\r\nindulge in such activities and sacrifice their own lives,\r\nseem to be growing by the day. This, without a doubt,\r\nis due to the inculcation of extremist beliefs through\r\nbrainwashing. We were alarmed to learn of the so-\r\ncalled training camps in Afghanistan and other\r\ncountries. How inhuman can one get?\r\nBefore the terrorist attacks on the United States,\r\nthe Taliban bombarded to pieces the ancient Buddhist\r\nstatues in Afghanistan, which were in fact a valuable\r\ncultural and historical legacy of the Afghan people\r\nthemselves, and also of the world at large. The appeals\r\nby civilized people the world over, including many\r\nbrotherly Muslim countries, called on the Taliban to\r\nrespect the sentiments of Buddhists and the\r\ninternational community alike. But, as we all know,\r\nthose appeals fell on deaf ears.\r\nHow can peaceful coexistence be possible in\r\nthese circumstances? How can peaceful coexistence be\r\npossible when the distorted mindsets of some give\r\nthem a sense of superiority over other people on the\r\nplanet and cause them to work for their destruction?\r\nThese are vital questions to which we need answers.\r\nAlthough we have individually condemned the\r\nterrorist attacks and collectively adopted resolutions in\r\nboth the Security Council and the General Assembly,\r\nthis gives little or no solace to the thousands of\r\nvictims, to those who have lost their near and dear\r\nones, to those whose lives have been forever changed\r\nas a result of these heinous attacks.\r\nWhat the international community must now\r\ndemonstrate is the requisite political will and a\r\nrenewed commitment to fight this menace. Today\r\nterrorists used jet aircraft as human-guided missiles;\r\ntomorrow, they will use chemical, biological or even\r\nnuclear weapons. These are weapons of mass\r\ndestruction that will wipe out entire cities and\r\npopulations. We must therefore undertake sustained\r\nand vigorous efforts for a comprehensive strategy to\r\ncombat and eliminate such terrorism. Pre-emptive\r\naction based on sound information will be of the\r\nessence.\r\nBhutan has faced its own share of terrorism.\r\nDespite our limited resources, we have taken a firm\r\nstand against such activities. We have an adequate legal\r\nframework to deal with those who commit such crimes.\r\nWe are increasing our capabilities to fight against this\r\nmenace. Above all, the entire Bhutanese people,\r\nirrespective of ethnic or religious origin or background,\r\nhave joined hands to fight against this scourge.\r\nIn our region of South Asia, terrorism has been\r\nrife for many years. Even we in the remote Himalayan\r\nmountains have not been spared. In an effort to counter\r\nit jointly, the seven countries of South Asia adopted the\r\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation\r\n(SAARC) Regional Convention on Suppression of\r\nTerrorism in 1987. Bhutan is a State party to that\r\nConvention.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to end my presentation\r\nwith a quotation from the sixteenth-century English\r\npoet John Donne, who put it so eloquently when he\r\nsaid:\r\n“No man is an island, entire of itself; every man\r\nis a piece of the continent, a part of the main …\r\nany man’s death diminishes me, because I am\r\ninvolved in mankind; and therefore never send to\r\nknow for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”\r\nMr. Zackheos (Cyprus): I should like at the\r\noutset to reiterate my delegation’s profound sorrow and\r\nsense of solidarity with the Government and the people\r\nof the United States in the face of this calamity which\r\nhas befallen them, and to condemn unequivocally these\r\ncriminal and barbaric acts, which we consider an attack\r\non all of humanity. Our sympathy also goes to the\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nfamilies of the victims and to all the countries whose\r\nnationals perished or are missing as a result of this\r\nheinous assault against the fundamental principles of\r\ncivilization.\r\nThe date of 11 September will go down in history\r\nnot only as a day of infamy but also as the day on\r\nwhich the international community was energized to\r\ntackle this scourge once and for all and eliminate it\r\nfrom the face of the Planet. To do so will require a long\r\nand sustained effort at all levels: national, regional and\r\ninternational. This multifaceted phenomenon can be\r\nattacked and contained only through effective action on\r\nmany fronts. It is a phenomenon that transcends\r\nnational borders, religions, cultures and civilizations.\r\nThat is why it is imperative that it be addressed\r\nthrough a global and multilateral approach. The\r\nprimary responsibility in the fight against terrorism\r\nundeniably lies with the United Nations, which,\r\nthrough the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, immediately responded to the shocking\r\nevents of 11 September with determination, adopting\r\nthe relevant resolutions of almost two weeks ago, and\r\nin particular Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nadopted last Friday.\r\nThe fight against terrorism must unite all\r\nhumanity and cannot be allowed to fall victim to\r\npoliticization or ephemeral considerations. Cyprus\r\ncategorically rejects any such attempt and any tendency\r\nto equate terrorism with the Arab or Muslim world. In\r\nthis respect, we commend the outstanding efforts of\r\nPresident George W. Bush to safeguard the culture of\r\ntolerance and multiculturalism which is the cornerstone\r\nof American society and the source of its strength.\r\nThe Government of Cyprus has aligned itself with\r\nthe conclusions and plan of action of the extraordinary\r\nEuropean Council meeting of 21 September, and my\r\ndelegation also aligns itself with the statement made\r\nearlier in the debate by the Permanent Representative\r\nof Belgium on behalf of the European Union.\r\nCyprus fully shares the view of the European\r\nUnion and others on the need for a global mobilization\r\nagainst terrorism under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. We also agree with the European Union on the\r\nneed for the international community to work in\r\ntandem to prevent and resolve regional conflicts such\r\nas the situation in the Middle East and in Cyprus.\r\nResolving the Cyprus problem will restore stability in\r\nthe eastern Mediterranean, usher in a new era of Greco-\r\nTurkish relations and thereby strengthen anti-terrorist\r\nefforts. We also support the integration of all countries\r\ninto an equitable world system of security, prosperity\r\nand development as the precondition for a strong\r\ncommunity for combating terrorism.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to join forces with\r\nall Governments in the struggle to eliminate the\r\nscourge of international terrorism. That determination\r\nhas been explicitly stated at the highest level, with the\r\nassurance that all practical measures will be taken in\r\ncooperation with the international community and the\r\nobligations deriving from the relevant international\r\ntreaties to which we have acceded. Cyprus has ratified\r\nor acceded to nine of the 12 international conventions\r\npertaining to international terrorism, including the\r\nthree basic conventions related to terrorism: the\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings;\r\nthe Convention against the Taking of Hostages; and the\r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of\r\nCrimes against Internationally Protected Persons,\r\nincluding Diplomatic Agents. It is, furthermore, one of\r\nthe 44 signatories to the most recent Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, whose\r\nratification will follow in the very near future.\r\nCyprus also supports the efforts for a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism, which\r\nwould enhance the ability of the international\r\ncommunity to respond more effectively to this ugly\r\nphenomenon. We hope that the negotiations currently\r\nunder way within the context of the United Nations\r\nwill be concluded soon, so that the General Assembly\r\ncan take the necessary steps for its realization.\r\nThe terrorist attacks on 11 September were a\r\nwake-up call to us all. They brought into sharper focus,\r\nin the most brutal and horrific manner, our\r\nvulnerability and the indiscriminate nature of terrorism.\r\nThis event dictated upon all of us the need to review\r\nsecurity and other measures in existence. I wish to\r\ninform the Assembly that the Council of Ministers of\r\nCyprus approved on 20 September a comprehensive\r\nproposal for the establishment of a task force to combat\r\ninternational terrorism, including illegal arms sales and\r\nbrokerage. This unit will, inter alia, have the authority\r\nto investigate, upon information or suspicion, the\r\nactivities, books and dealings of companies registered\r\nin Cyprus and the assets and accounts of any individual\r\nwho might be involved in the sponsorship of terrorism,\r\nincluding, for example, illegal arms sales, financial\r\ninvolvement and transhipment. The unit will also have\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nthe authority to take any action that might be deemed\r\nnecessary, such as freezing assets and/or accounts,\r\nrevoking company licences and confiscating cargoes.\r\nIn the murky world of terrorism, one of our major\r\ntasks is that related to its financing, which requires the\r\nconstant vigilance of all countries to ensure that their\r\nfinancial institutions will not be allowed to be used by\r\nterrorist networks, which are often connected in one\r\nway or another to international criminal cartels, such as\r\nthose involved in the drug trade and the trafficking of\r\narms. Cyprus, cognizant of the dangers associated with\r\nits status as a major regional financial centre, has for\r\nmany years now been actively engaged in establishing\r\na strong anti-money-laundering regime. According to\r\nthe United States Department of State International\r\nNarcotics Control Strategy Report,\r\n“the Central Bank has in place a strict regulatory\r\nframework aimed at preventing abuses within the\r\noffshore sector”.\r\nThe Report further notes the cooperation that exists\r\nbetween Cyprus and the United States in fighting this\r\ngrowing international phenomenon. Last year, the\r\nFinancial Action Task Force conducted a review of\r\nCyprus’ anti-money-laundering regime against 25\r\nspecific criteria. Cyprus was not identified as a non-\r\ncooperative country in the fight against money\r\nlaundering, while the Report clearly states that Cyprus\r\nhas a comprehensive anti-money-laundering system.\r\nI would also like to mention that, despite the size\r\nof our offshore banking sector, the Forum for Harmful\r\nTax Practices of the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development, in a list of tax havens\r\npublished in June last year, did not include Cyprus in\r\nthat list. Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund,\r\nin its most recent report on its assessment of banking\r\nsupervision in respect of the offshore sector, released in\r\nJuly of this year, commented positively on the situation\r\nin Cyprus.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate the determination of\r\nthe Republic of Cyprus to support the universal fight\r\nagainst terrorism, which is nothing more than an\r\nassault on civilization with the purpose of sowing fear\r\nin our collective consciousness. We do so in the firm\r\nbelief that, in order to safeguard civilization as we\r\nknow it, it is imperative to stand shoulder to shoulder\r\nin this common struggle.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave underestimated the capacity of terrorism to\r\nsurreptitiously infiltrate our borders and our cities. We\r\nhave underestimated its lethal and destructive power.\r\nWe have underestimated the force with which hatred\r\ncan lead a terrorist to commit acts of homicidal\r\nmadness that know no limits. Today we are paying the\r\nconsequences of our failure to foresee such things.\r\nOn 11 September, we began to see more clearly.\r\nWe have not seen the face of the enemy, but we know\r\nthat he can be identified. We do not know where to find\r\nhim, but we know that he is among us. We do not know\r\nwhat it is that he seeks, but we know that he is ready to\r\nstrike at any moment. On 11 September, we learned\r\nwith astonishment the dark depths of criminal\r\ndegradation to which terrorism can descend and the\r\nextent to which we are still unprepared to confront it.\r\nOur goal now is to prevent the recurrence of other\r\nBlack Tuesdays. We must eradicate terror from the face\r\nof the Earth. We must begin to act immediately, here\r\nand now. The measures recently adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council, and which Uruguay is committed to\r\nimplementing, as well as the numerous conventions,\r\ndeclarations and resolutions we have already adopted,\r\nare but a part of the response. We must do much more.\r\nIndividually or collectively through this Organization,\r\nwe must, among other things, ratify or adhere to\r\nexisting conventions on terrorism; promote strict\r\ncompliance with the provisions of those conventions;\r\nand expedite the conclusion of the instruments to\r\ncombat terrorism that are currently being negotiated\r\nwith a view to ensuring their entry into force at an\r\nearly date.\r\nWe must further consider the possibility of\r\nnegotiating a convention to identify as an international\r\ncrime, for which individuals are criminally liable, the\r\nknowledge or tolerance by Governments of terrorists or\r\nterrorist activities in their territories. We need to\r\nexpand judicial cooperation in the field of terrorism\r\nthrough, inter alia, the reciprocal recognition of court\r\nawards on terrorism and to promote the adoption of\r\nnational legislation on terrorism, establishing\r\nprocedures and mechanisms for the identification,\r\ndetention, prosecution and punishment of terrorists.\r\nIn countries that already have appropriate\r\nlegislation, we should consider the possibility of\r\nimposing more severe penalties on the perpetrators of\r\nterrorist acts, excluding the death penalty. We must\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nsimplify the procedures for the extradition of persons\r\naccused of terrorism and increase international\r\ncooperation to provide States with anti-terrorist\r\ntechniques and strategies, including measures for the\r\nprevention of terrorism.\r\nWithin the structure of the United Nations, we\r\nneed to establish a unit responsible for receiving,\r\ncentralizing and disseminating information concerning\r\nterrorism, including information provided by\r\nGovernments on the fulfilment of their international\r\nobligations in this area. In this respect, I wish to inform\r\nthe Assembly that, last week, the States members of the\r\nCommon Market of the South decided to create a\r\npermanent working group to organize and assess joint\r\nand coordinated actions of the four member States —\r\nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — against\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe must establish an obligation for States to\r\ntransmit to the aforementioned unit all information on\r\nterrorists and terrorist activities and on the measures\r\ntaken by the State to prevent or eliminate such\r\nactivities, as well as on domestic legislative activities\r\nand on the discharge of international obligations and\r\ncommitments undertaken in this area. We should also\r\nestablish mechanisms for the strict monitoring of\r\naccess by non-state actors to conventional weapons,\r\nweapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical and\r\nbacteriological weapons and so on.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nIn implementing these measures, we must bear in\r\nmind that our Governments have an enormous\r\nresponsibility to protect their peoples from terrorism.\r\nWe must therefore begin our work without delay so as\r\nto put an end as soon as possible to the era of terror.\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran): Terrorism is\r\na global menace. The tragic events of 11 September\r\nindeed shocked and outraged the international\r\ncommunity. They illustrated the scope and magnitude\r\nof our common vulnerability — the vulnerability of\r\neach and every one of us to the barbarism and\r\ninhumanity of a perverted response to injustice and\r\nexclusion.\r\nAllow me at the outset to use the words of\r\ncondemnation and sympathy of President Khatami in\r\nhis message of 11 September:\r\n“On behalf of the Iranian Government and\r\nnation, I condemn the hijacking and terrorist\r\nattacks on public centres in American cities,\r\nwhich have killed a large number of innocent\r\nhuman beings. My deep sympathy goes out to the\r\nAmerican nation, particularly those who have\r\nsuffered from the attacks, and also to the families\r\nof the victims. Terrorism is doomed, and the\r\ninternational community should take effective\r\nmeasures in a bid to eradicate it.”\r\nUnder these tragic circumstances, empathy is the\r\nonly human response. We cannot but set aside our\r\ndifferences and share the pain and anguish of not only\r\nthousands of families who lost their loved ones, but an\r\nentire nation that has been traumatized by the terror of\r\nthis crime. To feel emotional and angry is only human;\r\nbut we need a great deal of collective reflection and\r\nwisdom for a rational and far-sighted response — a\r\nresponse that should focus not only on this horrific\r\ncrime, but on terrorism in general, wherever and\r\nwhenever it occurs and, more importantly, on the root\r\ncauses of injustice and exclusion that can be exploited\r\nby demagogues to inflict so much harm on innocent\r\nhuman beings.\r\nThis requires vision, serious political will and the\r\nactive participation and cooperation of all. As a global\r\nmenace, terrorism needs a global response, founded on\r\ninclusion, fairness and international legitimacy. The\r\nresponse to a tragedy caused by blind hatred cannot be\r\nindiscriminate retribution, putting many innocent lives\r\nat risk; it should focus on bringing the culprits to\r\njustice. Terrorists should not be allowed to set the\r\nagenda or dictate our response.\r\nTerrorism is a heinous product of the outdated\r\nparadigm of international relations. That paradigm was\r\nfounded on the “will to power” and the arrogance that\r\nwas associated with it, that is, that “might makes\r\nright”. As might ruled, injustice prevailed and hatred\r\nflourished, and some who were dispossessed became\r\ninclined to resort to terror and violence. We must\r\neradicate terrorism by changing the prevalent mentality\r\nthat provided a fertile ground for the growth of this\r\nmenace. All those who are serious about fighting\r\nterrorism, especially if they are in a position of global\r\npower, would be well advised not to resort to\r\nstatements and policies emanating from emotions\r\nintertwined with the arrogance of power, which can\r\nonly further entrench the mentality that produced\r\nterrorism.\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nThe international community has been moving\r\naway from that paradigm to a new paradigm founded\r\non equality, stakeholding and the dispersion of power.\r\nThe purposes and principles set out in the United\r\nNations Charter and the decision of the Assembly to\r\ndesignate this year as the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations reflect the will of the\r\ninternational community to move forward to this new\r\nparadigm. Allow me to quote from the final draft of a\r\nforthcoming book that has been prepared by a group of\r\neminent persons selected by the Secretary-General to\r\ndefine the parameters of a new paradigm of dialogue\r\namong civilizations:\r\n“The existence of common dangers —\r\nindeed, terrorism — has created this equality in\r\nvulnerability that seems to beg as an answer a\r\nstronger adherence to common norms, common\r\nbehaviour and common values, for the dangers\r\nwe are talking about ... can only be minimized by\r\na universal alliance of rules of behaviour and\r\nvalues.\r\n“Dialogue brings with it equal footing ... as\r\nit is a process by which we accept, as much as we\r\nwant to be accepted. We include, as much as we\r\nwant to be included. We listen, as much as we\r\nwant to be listened to.\r\n“In these terms, dialogue can perhaps\r\neventually usher in a new paradigm of global\r\nrelations because it challenges the old paradigm\r\nof hegemonism, the politics of power — in other\r\nwords, of ‘might makes right’ ... dialogue can be\r\na framework where the weakest is accorded the\r\nprivilege to be listened to, and where the\r\nstrongest finds it necessary to explain its case to\r\nothers.”\r\nThis Organization and this body provide a unique\r\nmechanism to mobilize the international community to\r\naddress terrorism at its roots. My delegation fully\r\nconcurs with the comments of the Secretary-General in\r\nhis thoughtful editorial in The New York Times that\r\n“The United Nations ... provides the forum\r\nnecessary for building a universal coalition, and\r\ncan ensure global legitimacy for the long-term\r\nresponse to terrorism.”\r\nIt is, indeed, an effective mechanism that can draw\r\nupon the resources and capabilities of each and every\r\nMember State within a rule-based and non-\r\ndiscriminatory framework, thus forging an international\r\nconsensus in the fight against terrorism.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is fully prepared to\r\nparticipate in and contribute actively to a global\r\ncampaign against terrorism led by the United Nations.\r\nIn his letter of 16 September to the Secretary-General,\r\nPresident Khatami proposed that comprehensive and\r\ninclusive negotiations should commence to articulate\r\npractical and serious global policies and strategies to\r\neradicate the menace of terrorism. He also called for\r\nthe convening of a global summit, at the earliest\r\npossible date, to register and demonstrate the highest\r\ninternational political will to root out terrorism.\r\nIn our view, the General Assembly should\r\nconsider a multifaceted approach to terrorism, which\r\nshould include, as one of its major components, a\r\ncomprehensive legal framework. In this context, we\r\nneed to articulate objective criteria which would enable\r\nthe international community to identify and combat\r\nterrorism, regardless of who the victims or culprits may\r\nbe. Legitimacy, as well as the sustainability of the\r\nglobal struggle against terrorism, rests on applying a\r\nsingle set of standards to all. It is not acceptable that\r\npatterns of alliance, rather than actual engagement in\r\nterrorist activities, should become the determining\r\nfactor. Thus the credibility of the campaign against\r\nterrorism is seriously undermined when policies and\r\npractices designed to instil terror and fear among the\r\nentire Palestinian people receive acquiescing silence,\r\nwhile resistance to foreign occupation and State\r\nterrorism is conveniently demonized.\r\nA comprehensive legal framework should also\r\ninclude appropriate guidelines for a rational and rule-\r\nbased approach across the board, so that no terrorist, no\r\nmatter where he or she commits his or her acts of\r\nterror, can find refuge, a source of support, financing or\r\nrecruitment in any member of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee and the Sixth Committee Working Group\r\nshould speed up their efforts to prepare the necessary\r\nlegal documents for adoption by the proposed global\r\nsummit. The draft comprehensive convention on\r\ncombating international terrorism is certainly one of\r\nthe appropriate documents that could be considered by\r\nthe Ad Hoc Committee and the Working Group. We\r\nshould endeavour to arrive at a consensus on the key\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nissues of the proposed convention and pave the way for\r\nits adoption.\r\nBut the work of the General Assembly on legal\r\nframeworks should not lead us to lose sight of\r\nfundamental issues of conflict prevention and\r\nappropriate political, social and economic strategies to\r\naddress the mentality that breeds terrorism, as well as\r\nthe root causes that nurture it.\r\nTerrorism has no religion, no nationality or ethnic\r\nbackground. It is indeed the negation of everything\r\nreligions stand for. Attempts to attribute the recent acts\r\nof terror and violence even to a misguided\r\ninterpretation of Islam are not only dangerous, but\r\nutterly false. Intolerance, extremism and violence have\r\nno place in Islam or among its adherents. We must not\r\npurport to accord any legitimacy to these acts by\r\nassociating them with even a misguided reading of\r\nIslam, a religion which categorically condemns the\r\nkilling of a single innocent human being, equating it\r\nwith genocide against entire mankind. The leader of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, in his speech of 17\r\nSeptember, clearly articulated the Islamic position,\r\nwhen he said:\r\n“killing of innocent people, in any place and with\r\nany type of weapon, be it long-range missiles or\r\nnuclear, chemical or biological weapons, carried\r\nout by any organization, country or individual, is\r\ncategorically rejected and condemned.”\r\nMore recently, in his speech of 26 September,\r\nAyatollah Khamenei articulated that fighting against\r\nterrorism is a religious responsibility of all Muslims,\r\namounting to jihad, and called on the Islamic world to\r\ntake the lead in a serious and comprehensive campaign\r\nto eradicate terrorism. Muslim scholars from across the\r\nIslamic world have taken similar positions.\r\nIt is a source of deep concern that the events of\r\n11 September have given rise to a new wave of\r\nIslamophobia and bigotry against Muslims and Arabs.\r\nDisturbing trends have surfaced to bring about a clash\r\namong civilizations and prevent the realization of\r\ndialogue at the national and international levels. The\r\nrecent event should not be utilized to further stimulate\r\nchronic cultural and political misperceptions,\r\nmisconceptions, stereotypes and prejudices.\r\nFurthermore, the abuse of this catastrophe, exemplified\r\nby the portraying of an artificial clash between Islam\r\nand the West and the increasing suppression of the\r\nPalestinian people by Israel, would only exacerbate and\r\naggravate its bitter and inhuman dimensions and\r\nimplications.\r\nAllow me to conclude by quoting again from the\r\ndraft work of the Group of Eminent Persons of the\r\nUnited Nations Dialogue among Civilizations:\r\n“The tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nmake the call for a dialogue among civilizations\r\neven more compelling ... Whether we are moving\r\ntowards a clash of civilizations or towards greater\r\nhuman solidarity against those who murder\r\ninnocents only because they are different is really\r\nup to each of us. The choice is neither\r\npredetermined nor unavoidable; that is why each\r\nof us individually chooses and takes personal\r\nresponsibility. We can let the small minority take\r\nover and throw us into continuous conflict at all\r\nlevels; or we can enlarge the coalition of those\r\nwho respect each other’s dignity and common\r\nhumanity, who value the life of our family\r\nmembers as well as the life of our fellow human\r\nbeings on the other side of the planet.”\r\nMr. Mangoaela (Lesotho): The events of 11\r\nSeptember have shocked and saddened us all. While\r\nthese horrendous terrorist attacks on the World Trade\r\nCenter and the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania were\r\ncarried out on American soil, their effects have touched\r\nall members of the international community and\r\nimmediately galvanized the legislative organs of the\r\nUnited Nations to pass General Assembly resolution\r\n56/1 and Security Council resolution 1368 (2001) just a\r\nday after the events. We are thus grateful for the\r\nconvening of these meetings at this difficult time and\r\njoin other peace-loving nations around the world in\r\noffering our deepest sympathies to the Government and\r\npeople of the United States and in particular to all\r\nvictims and the families of those who lost their lives.\r\nOur heartfelt sympathies also go to the families of all\r\nother nations that lost citizens in these attacks.\r\nWe pay tribute to all those who dauntlessly\r\ncarried out rescue efforts amidst such devastation.\r\nThroughout this ordeal, the American people have\r\nshown their resilience as they embark on rebuilding\r\nand reassuring terror-stricken citizens of their safety, as\r\nwell as guarding against further attacks.\r\nSometimes opportunities present themselves in\r\nunique — and often painful — ways. However painful\r\nthe events of the last three weeks have proven to be,\r\nthey have presented an opportunity for the international\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\ncommunity to unite with a view to putting an end to the\r\nscourge of terrorism. There can be no justification for\r\nunprovoked attacks on innocent civilians. The\r\ninternational community needs to strengthen the rule of\r\nlaw to counter terrorism so that all those who initiate,\r\norganize and perpetrate these acts, as well as those who\r\naid, support, finance and/or assist these cowardly acts\r\ncan be held accountable. Since criminal acts of terror\r\ndo not respect boundaries, enforcement of criminal law\r\nagainst them cannot be the exclusive competence of\r\nStates.\r\nIn this regard, it is worth noting that a new\r\ninstitution, the soon to be established International\r\nCriminal Court, will be able to prosecute the kind of\r\ncrime against humanity carried out three weeks ago.\r\nThis Court will be merely part of the bigger project for\r\nestablishing international peace and criminal justice by\r\npunishing grave violations of law such as the ones we\r\nhave just witnessed.\r\nThese vicious attacks against innocent civilians\r\nfrom more than 80 countries underscore the need for\r\ninternational cooperation for the early establishment of\r\nan international criminal justice institution that will\r\nbring justice by holding accountable individuals who\r\ntarget innocent civilians, in complete disregard of\r\nhumanitarian standards of warfare. All States should\r\ntherefore extend practical cooperation to the machinery\r\nof international criminal justice if we are to eliminate\r\nindiscriminate violence against innocent people.\r\nBut, of course, there are many more ways to fight\r\nterrorism, whenever and by whomsoever it is\r\ncommitted. Terrorism is not only a global menace; it is\r\nalso a threat to international peace and security. No\r\ncountry can hope to win the war against terrorism\r\nalone; hence, enhanced international cooperation\r\nremains indispensable if we are to succeed in this war.\r\nThe Security Council has once again\r\ndemonstrated its determination to fight terrorism by\r\nunanimously passing resolution 1373 (2001). Full\r\nimplementation of this resolution is of utmost\r\nimportance. The General Assembly should urgently\r\nendorse the expanded mandate of the Terrorism\r\nPrevention Branch of the Centre for International\r\nCrime Prevention and provide the Branch with the\r\nnecessary resources to enable it to carry out its\r\nmandate efficiently and effectively.\r\nIn the wake of the earlier attacks on the United\r\nStates embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, as well as the\r\n11 September attacks, it is now evident that terrorist\r\ngroups will stop at nothing to achieve their goals of\r\nwinning attention by the very atrocity of their tactics.\r\nOur efforts to fight this faceless enemy are constrained\r\nby the fact that terrorist groups do not possess a visible\r\neconomy, land area or identified population; hence,\r\nthey are less vulnerable to international sanctions.\r\nAdvances in technology have also made it difficult to\r\ntrace their covert networks and to police false\r\ndocuments and transhipment through bogus companies.\r\nRaising public awareness of the nature and scope of\r\ninternational terrorism and its relationship to organized\r\ncrime and drug trafficking, among other things, has\r\nthus become the international community’s urgent\r\npriority.\r\nNow that we live in a world where terrorist acts\r\nof violence have become commonplace, it is no longer\r\nfar-fetched nor far off for terrorists groups to acquire\r\nand use weapons of mass destruction with devastating\r\nconsequences for our world order. The indiscriminate\r\nnature of these weapons and their extraordinary range\r\nof destruction multiplies the challenges and threats we\r\nare facing.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Committee established by the\r\nGeneral Assembly to frame an international convention\r\nfor the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism has\r\nover the years endeavoured without success to resolve\r\nthe outstanding issues relating to the draft convention.\r\nThe conclusion of negotiations on this convention and\r\nits submission to the General Assembly at this session\r\nhave now become imperative.\r\nA number of international anti-terrorist\r\nconventions that empower national courts to prosecute\r\nor extradite terrorist suspects have been concluded over\r\nthe years. However, like all laws, a treaty without\r\nenforcement becomes useless. Universal adherence to\r\nthese instruments is essential for the fight against\r\nterrorism, but unfortunately, most of these important\r\nconventions have remained a dead letter; hence the\r\nurgent need to take steps to raise awareness about these\r\ninstruments, to encourage States to sign and ratify them\r\nand to provide assistance, where needed, for their\r\nimplementation.\r\nConsolidation of all international instruments on\r\nterrorism with a view to closing all existing gaps and\r\nloopholes will be necessary to enable law enforcement\r\nagencies to effectively cooperate and to enable national\r\ncourts to investigate and prosecute these crimes. It is\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nthus imperative for the Ad Hoc Committee established\r\nby General Assembly resolution 51/210 to complete its\r\nnegotiations on a draft comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism and to submit the convention to\r\nthe General Assembly for adoption.\r\nThe need to finalize the question of convening a\r\nhigh level conference under the auspices of the United\r\nNations to formulate a joint organized response of the\r\ninternational community to terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations has now become urgent. The Sixth\r\nCommittee should finalize this issue at the current\r\nsession and submit its recommendations to this\r\nAssembly without further delay.\r\nLesotho fully supports all efforts of the\r\ninternational community to combat and eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism. As we refine our strategies for\r\nan effective response to terrorism, we must be careful\r\nnot to violate human rights and international law. Our\r\nefforts must preserve the distinction between the guilty\r\nand the innocent, between the perpetrators and the\r\ncivilians and between those who commit atrocities and\r\nthose who simply share their religious beliefs, ethnicity\r\nor national origin. If we allow these distinctions to be\r\nblurred and if we abandon the basic principles of law,\r\nthen we will descend to the level of perpetrators, even\r\nwhile purporting to seek justice. The logic of terrorism\r\nis that the ends justify the means, but in our fight\r\nagainst terrorism, the ends cannot justify the means.\r\nWe must continue to uphold the principles that\r\nterrorism seeks to destroy: to strengthen democracy\r\nand promote its core values and principles, to respect\r\ninternational law and prevent violence and crimes\r\nagainst humanity. This is the way to deny the\r\nperpetrators of this crime their ultimate victory.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia): The Australian people are\r\nshocked and outraged at the heinous attacks on the\r\nUnited States on 11 September. These attacks and the\r\ncatastrophic loss of life, injury and destruction are\r\nutterly repugnant and inhumane. They can never be\r\njustified and must never be repeated. It is incumbent\r\nupon all of us to take definitive action to bring the\r\nperpetrators of these attacks to justice.\r\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play in\r\nensuring that all Member States cooperate in taking the\r\nnecessary steps to combat international terrorism. We\r\nfully support the measures and strategies outlined in\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373\r\n(2001). We urge all States to take immediate steps to\r\ncomply with these resolutions.\r\nLast week, the Prime Minister of Australia\r\nannounced far-reaching measures to freeze the\r\nfinancial assets of terrorists and terrorist groups. We\r\nare now looking at what further measures are necessary\r\nto give full effect to Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001).\r\nEffective implementation and enforcement of the\r\nUnited Nations-sponsored anti-terrorist conventions\r\nwill create a formidable international legal regime that\r\nwill starve terrorists of funds and ensure that those\r\ninvolved in terrorist activities are swiftly brought to\r\njustice. We must all work relentlessly to ensure that\r\nthese conventions have a real and abiding impact.\r\nAustralia is party to nine of the 12 United\r\nNations-sponsored anti-terrorism conventions. We are\r\nnow taking steps to become a party to the remaining\r\nconventions as a matter of priority.\r\nThis existing framework of subject-specific\r\nconventions can, however, be strengthened. The\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism which supplements the existing conventions\r\nwould strengthen and broaden the international law\r\nframework. Therefore, we believe negotiations on the\r\ncomprehensive convention against international\r\nterrorism should be concluded without delay. Australia\r\nis determined to work towards this end at the\r\nforthcoming meeting of the working group. There can\r\nbe no doubt that there is a need for such a convention\r\nnow. We should all commit to making the adoption of\r\nthis convention one of the key objectives of this\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe know that the battle against international\r\nterrorism will not be easy or quick. It will require\r\ndetermination and patience, dedication and vigour — a\r\nconcerted and united approach by us all. Australia’s\r\ncommitment to this common endeavour is — and will\r\ncontinue to be — steadfast and unwavering.\r\nMr. Kastrup (Germany): The eleventh of\r\nSeptember has changed the international agenda. The\r\nstruggle against terrorism has become a top priority for\r\nall of us.\r\nThe criminal attacks in New York, Washington\r\nand Pennsylvania have challenged us as members of\r\nthe civilized world. The unprecedented, faceless and\r\nbarbaric acts were directed against the very fabric that\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nunites humanity: respect for human life and human\r\ndignity, the values of liberty, tolerance, democracy and\r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts.\r\nWe welcome wholeheartedly the swift reaction by\r\nthe General Assembly, and we fully stand by the\r\nSecurity Council, which stated in its resolution 1368\r\n(2001) that the terrorist attacks on New York and\r\nWashington were a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity, thus meeting the conditions under\r\ninternational law for resolute action against the\r\nperpetrators, organizers and sponsors of the attacks.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the terrorist threat, Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) has sent out a\r\nremarkably vigorous signal of strength. We have\r\nalready begun, jointly with our partners in the\r\nEuropean Union and at the national level, to implement\r\nit.\r\nMy Belgian colleague yesterday discussed the\r\nEuropean Council’s landmark declaration of 21\r\nSeptember, which takes a holistic approach to the\r\nscourge of terrorism. Indeed, the European Union\r\nproposes to integrate as many countries as possible in a\r\nworldwide system of security and prosperity.\r\nDesigning and implementing a comprehensive\r\npolitical, social and developmental strategy for\r\nregional conflict prevention must now be, more than\r\never, a priority on the international agenda. This\r\nincludes the creation of a basis for political and\r\neconomic stabilization for the regions of crisis in the\r\nMiddle East and Central Asia.\r\nGermany will adopt all necessary measures, at the\r\nnational, European and international levels, to combat\r\nterrorism. We shall improve the efficiency of our\r\nstruggle against terrorism, inter alia, through\r\namendments to criminal law, through optimizing the\r\nsafety of air traffic both on the ground and in the air\r\nand through measures to seek out and to disrupt the\r\nfinancial structures of terrorists. Our police continue to\r\nwork, together with the American Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation, to dismantle a terrorist network which\r\nestablished footholds in Germany, in other European\r\ncountries and in the United States, abusing their\r\nfreedoms and their hospitality. Our intelligence\r\nservices have done a good job thus far combating\r\ninternational terrorism, also with regard to disclosing\r\nterrorist financial structures. Their investigations also\r\nbrought about the arrest of Osama bin Laden’s\r\nthen-finance chief.\r\nOur struggle against terrorism is a defence of our\r\nopen and free society and will be conducted with full\r\nrespect for the rule of law. Terrorism will not induce us\r\nto abandon the very values we defend. It will not stop\r\nus from passing a modern immigration law aimed at\r\nthe integration of foreigners. My country is aware, as\r\nmuch as other countries are, that now is the time for\r\ndecent people to unite against hate and violence,\r\nregardless of their origins, their race or their creed. In a\r\nstatement to the German Parliament on 19 September,\r\nFederal Chancellor Schroeder was unequivocal in\r\nstating that the attacks in New York and Washington\r\nhave nothing to do with religion. They are the\r\nexpression of a criminal mindset. Islamic States and\r\nreligious communities, too, have been and are targeted\r\nby this indiscriminate terrorism. There must be no\r\ndoubt that there is no political or religious justification\r\nfor terrorist violence. What we are confronted with is\r\nnot, and should not be perceived as, a clash of\r\ncivilizations. What we are confronted with is the\r\nterrorists’ clash with civilization.\r\nThe United Nations is uniquely positioned to\r\ncoordinate and to invigorate the international response\r\nto terrorism. In the face of terrorist violence, hate and\r\nchaos, the United Nations is called upon to demonstrate\r\nthat a world in which humanity can live free from fear\r\nand want is not only a common aspiration, but an\r\nachievable goal. The Millennium Declaration has laid\r\nout the way to go. The peaceful resolution of conflicts,\r\nthe rule of law, the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, equitable distribution of the benefits of\r\nglobalization and poverty eradication are indispensable\r\nlandmarks. We trust that the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly will live up to their responsibilities\r\nin this regard. Failure to do so would seriously\r\ncompromise the credibility of the Organization.\r\nThe United Nations must engage its full potential\r\nto identify and eventually eradicate the deeper roots of\r\nterrorism. We must work on the full and timely\r\nimplementation of the plan of action adopted during\r\nthe Third United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, hosted by the European Union in\r\nBrussels in May. We must ensure the success of the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Monterrey next spring, and\r\nwe must strive for a successful, development-oriented\r\nround of the World Trade Organization in Doha in\r\nNovember.\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nThere is, in our view, a clear opportunity for\r\nnegotiations on a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism to be brought to a successful\r\nconclusion, if a spirit of compromise and a sense of\r\ncommon purpose prevail in the Sixth Committee. In a\r\nnumber of areas, the convention would offer a\r\nsignificant added value to existing conventions.\r\nWe should also accelerate our pace towards the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, as a\r\ntimely response to combat impunity for crimes such as\r\nthose perpetrated on 11 September. Mary Robinson was\r\nright in characterizing these crimes as crimes against\r\nhumanity. The Security Council made a pertinent call\r\nfor maximum adherence to the existing anti-terrorist\r\nconventions. Germany, for its part, has signed all 12\r\nconventions, has ratified 10 and is in the process of\r\nratifying, as a matter of urgency, the two remaining\r\nones. Irrespective of the date of ratification, we are\r\nalready implementing all United Nations conventions\r\nin full.\r\nMore than ever, the United Nations is called upon\r\nto uphold the values of tolerance, dignity and social\r\njustice through concrete action and through the\r\npromotion of a dialogue among and within\r\ncivilizations. And the plight of all those who suffer\r\nfrom terrorism must be addressed. This includes\r\nnotably the people of Afghanistan. They should know\r\nthat the entire world will assist them in building a\r\nbetter, more humane and more prosperous future, once\r\nthey have escaped the vicious circle of oppression and\r\nmisery. I invite the Assembly to work with us to\r\nconvey this message also through the resolutions on\r\n“Emergency international assistance for peace,\r\nnormalcy and reconstruction of war-stricken\r\nAfghanistan and the situation in Afghanistan and its\r\nimplications for international peace and security”, of\r\nwhich Germany has been and will continue to be the\r\nmain sponsor.\r\nMy delegation stands ready to cooperate with\r\nother delegations in living up to the high expectations\r\nthat the world is now placing on the United Nations.\r\nMr. de Saram (Sri Lanka): The Foreign Minister\r\nof Sri Lanka regrets that he is unable, because of other\r\npressing commitments, to be here to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the subject of terrorism. He has\r\nrequested me to read to the Assembly on his behalf the\r\nstatement he would have made. I have now the honour\r\nto do so. It reads as follows:\r\n“On behalf of the delegation of Sri Lanka, I\r\nconvey to the President warmest congratulations\r\non his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. To his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\nI would also convey Sri Lanka’s appreciation for\r\nthe careful and devoted manner in which he\r\npresided over the affairs, and the extremely busy\r\nschedule, of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nAssembly.\r\n“The horrors of the morning of Tuesday, 11\r\nSeptember, the spectacle of international\r\nterrorism in action, viewed live on television\r\nscreens the world over, has cast a heavy pall on\r\nall of us and on humanity as a whole.\r\n“We are all still deeply moved by what\r\nhappened in the United States that tragic\r\nmorning. We will always be affected by the\r\nmemories we shall carry with us for as long as we\r\nlive.\r\n“The President, the Government and the\r\npeople of Sri Lanka have conveyed to the\r\nPresident, the Government and the people of the\r\nUnited States, and all those bereaved, Sri Lanka’s\r\nprofound condolences. On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Sri Lanka, I would also today\r\nconvey to the delegation of the United States the\r\nvery deepest of sympathies.\r\n“The terrorism of 11 September, so\r\nshocking as it was, gave rise to a coming together\r\nof the people of this great city of New York in the\r\nfinest traditions of humanity.\r\n“On 12 September, the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly convened to express their\r\ncollective condolences; an unqualified\r\ncondemnation of the terrorism; a determination\r\nthat those responsible should not go unpunished;\r\nand firm concurrence that terrorism threatened\r\nthe foundations of human society and order and\r\nwould need to be, and must be, globally removed.\r\n“Let us hope that such a deep sense of the\r\ntogetherness of all of humanity at times of great\r\ncrises will continue to be pervasive.\r\n“To ensure that those responsible for the\r\nterror of 11 September are brought to justice and\r\nare deprived of their support and their resources,\r\nwhatever and wherever that may be, is a matter of\r\nimmediate urgency.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\n“Sri Lanka has assured the Government of\r\nthe United States of every possible assistance Sri\r\nLanka could provide.\r\n“Terrorism is, sadly, no stranger to Sri\r\nLanka. We in Sri Lanka know terrorism,\r\nunfortunately, only too well.\r\n“We know the horrific direct consequences\r\nof an act of terrorism: the carnage; the horror; the\r\nthousands of unsuspecting innocent lives lost or\r\nmaimed, in the flash of an explosion; the\r\nthousands of families then left bereaved; the\r\ncountless personal tragedies that terrorism leaves\r\nin its wake.\r\n“There are also the larger disruptions of\r\nnational stability and order — of the economy, of\r\ninfrastructures, of the customary ways of life.\r\n“Yet we must not forget the elaborate\r\nfunding, support, and preparation — in a word,\r\nthe logistics — that lie behind a single act of\r\nterrorism: the extensive secret collection\r\norganizations, their associates, their collectors,\r\ntheir enforcers, their many other supporters,\r\nmisguided or otherwise; the ability to transfer\r\nmillions, perhaps just by word of mouth; the\r\nnumerous connections to the underworld of\r\ncrime; the deliberate fanning of the flames of\r\ndifference or discord in societies into the fanatical\r\nhatred from which crucible a suicide mission is\r\nborn; and above it all there looms the reclusive\r\nleader who attracts and directs the misguided and\r\nthe impressionable.\r\n“The elimination of the supportive financial\r\nsystems on which terrorism depends must, in Sri\r\nLanka’s view, be a principal objective, and that\r\nwill require a global undertaking — complex,\r\ndifficult, multifaceted and long-term.\r\n“However, because of the events of 11\r\nSeptember, important beginnings are now being\r\nmade for that purpose, beginnings which,\r\nhopefully, will be of assistance as well to those of\r\nus who have known the heavy hand of terrorism\r\nfor many years past.\r\n“May I recall here my words delivered\r\nalmost exactly a year ago to the Millennium\r\nAssembly about Sri Lanka’s experience with\r\nterrorism:\r\n“‘A criminal organization — whether\r\ninvolved in rebellion against a State or\r\nnot — must depend for its sustenance\r\noutside the law. For its massive operations,\r\nand massive weaponry, massive collections\r\nof funds are continually required. As funds\r\navailable for criminal activities within a\r\nState, especially a developing State, are\r\ninevitably small, and the monitoring of their\r\ncollection and disbursement relatively\r\nsimple, fund-collection for such activities is\r\ncarried out abroad — through international\r\ncriminal networks, of course — and also, as\r\nin all criminal enterprises, through knowing\r\nor unknowing front organizations or other\r\nentities that now proliferate in many forms,\r\nin many countries — often in the guise,\r\nsadly, of charitable groups or groups\r\nostensibly concerned with human rights or\r\nethnic, cultural or social matters.’\r\n“I also said:\r\n“‘The magnitude of the collection of\r\nfunds abroad ... and the extensiveness of the\r\nreach of the international networks\r\ndeveloped for that purpose, boggle the\r\nmind. Their receipts seem to exceed the\r\nreceipts of many transnational\r\nconglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues\r\ncome, of course, from the customary illegal\r\ntrade in drugs, arms or other merchandise,\r\nincluding the smuggling of humans.\r\n“‘But there also exists a far more\r\nabundant and seemingly limitless reservoir\r\nof funds — namely, expatriates of similar\r\nethnicity settled abroad. As the western\r\nmedia has reported over the past few years\r\nfrom time to time, collections from\r\nexpatriates abroad for the armed group\r\nknown as the Tamil Tigers, which is battling\r\nthe Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering\r\nin their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a\r\nmonth from one country; $600,000 a month\r\nfrom another, $2.7 million a month from yet\r\nanother; and large additional funds from\r\nexpatriates in still other countries.’\r\n(A/55/PV.21, p. 26)\r\n“Let me recall also the following sentences\r\nfrom a report submitted by the Secretary-General\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nin 1997, which often come to our minds in Sri\r\nLanka:\r\n“‘Government authority and civil\r\nsociety are increasingly threatened by\r\ntransnational networks of crime, narcotics,\r\nmoney-laundering and terrorism. Access by\r\nunderworld groups to sophisticated\r\ninformation technologies and weaponry as\r\nwell as to the various instrumentalities\r\nthrough which the global market economy\r\nfunctions are vastly increasing the potential\r\npower and influence of these groups, posing\r\na threat to law and order and to legitimate\r\neconomic and political institutions.’\r\n(A/51/950, para. 143)\r\n“The many disparate forces of international\r\nterrorism do not come together in one monolithic\r\nwhole. They are variously interconnected in\r\nnumerous ways, and their international networks\r\nare extensive. They are mutually supportive and\r\ncommunicate through the global underworld of\r\ncrime when special missions are afoot. If\r\ninternational terrorism is ever to be removed from\r\nour midst, we must begin with the recognition\r\nthat international terrorism is a form of global\r\ncriminality. We must not let ourselves be\r\ndeceived by the artfully crafted cloaks and\r\nmantles of false pretensions. It is the method of\r\nterrorism — the murder of innocent civilians and\r\nthe defiance of the sanctity of life — that defines\r\nterrorism.\r\n“The eradication of such a global criminal\r\nphenomenon requires a global governmental and\r\nnon-governmental endeavour in many fields.\r\n“There will have to be numerous bilateral,\r\nsubregional, interregional and global\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental\r\narrangements.\r\n“To such a global endeavour, this\r\nOrganization, the United Nations, must\r\ncontribute. The United Nations is no stranger to\r\nthe development and administration of global\r\nprogrammes.\r\n“One of the magnificent achievements of\r\nthe Organization in the last half century has been\r\nthe transformation that has taken place in global\r\nopinion on the relationship that should obtain\r\nbetween the governing and the governed, between\r\nthe Government and the citizen. It was on the\r\nbasis of the moral authority of the General\r\nAssembly’s Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, and the determined endeavours of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights, that this\r\ntransformation was achieved. The dignity of the\r\nindividual has now — largely as a result of\r\nUnited Nations leadership in the field of human\r\nrights — been placed, as it should be, among the\r\nprimary priorities of national and international\r\nattention.\r\n“The achievement is due, in large part, to\r\nthe remarkable multifaceted and powerful\r\nstructure that has been developed within the\r\nUnited Nations system of organizations and\r\nagencies over the past 50 years for the protection\r\nand promotion of human rights. We know of the\r\nlarge number of general multilateral conventions\r\nthat were concluded. We are acquainted with their\r\nreporting requirements and monitoring\r\ncommittees. We know of the many special\r\nrapporteurs. There are training programmes and\r\ncentres on human rights. We have had special\r\nsessions of the General Assembly and special\r\nconferences. Numerous trust funds supplement\r\nand often exceed the allocations from the regular\r\nbudget of the United Nations. There is an\r\nenormous public relations programme on human\r\nrights. There is a High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights. The list of United Nations entities that\r\nmake human rights one of their major concerns\r\ncould go on, and they would still not include the\r\nhundreds of governmental and non-governmental\r\nnational and international groups that are\r\nthemselves engaged in the protection and\r\nadvancement of human rights, and we have not as\r\nyet come to the international and national print\r\nand electronic media.\r\n“If only such a powerful edifice would turn\r\nits attention to the eradication of the horrors of\r\nterrorism that afflict so many in developed and\r\ndeveloping countries alike.\r\n“Moreover, let us remember in this\r\nconnection that the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights is not limited in scope to ensuring\r\nthe observance of human rights by Governments\r\nalone.\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\n“The Declaration has a far wider purpose:\r\nthe observance of human rights by all —\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental alike. One\r\nneed only look to the explicit prescription in\r\narticle 3 of the Universal Declaration, which\r\nrequires that everyone has the right to life, and to\r\nthe provisions of article 30, which prescribe:\r\n“‘Nothing in this Declaration may be\r\ninterpreted as implying for any State, group\r\nor person any right to engage in any activity\r\nor to perform any act aimed at the\r\ndestruction of any of the rights and\r\nfreedoms set forth herein.’\r\n“An act of terrorism by a non-governmental\r\nentity against civilians is surely one of the most\r\nheinous violations of the human rights of its\r\nvictims and, surely, a crime against humanity as\r\nwell.\r\n“Sri Lanka pledges to follow closely, and\r\ncooperate fully in, the work of the United Nations\r\non terrorism. Sri Lanka will, of course, do so\r\npursuant to the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil, and in particular resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nadopted by the Security Council last Friday night,\r\n28 September.\r\n“Sri Lanka will also follow closely and\r\ncooperate fully with such other United Nations\r\nprogrammes against terrorism as shall, hopefully,\r\nalso develop within the United Nations system, in\r\nthe knowledge that it is the prevention of the\r\nterrorist’s strike that should be the principal focus\r\nof a global endeavour against terrorism, and that\r\nfundamental to such prevention is the interdiction\r\nof terrorism’s life-blood, the provision of funds\r\nmade available in millions — knowingly or\r\nunknowingly, wilfully or otherwise, directly or\r\nindirectly, overtly or covertly — in circumstances\r\nin which it is possible that such funds may be\r\nutilized to further terrorism’s purpose.\r\n“It is surely morally unacceptable in\r\ncontemporary times, whether there be specific\r\nlegal provision in international conventions to\r\nthat effect or not, that funds should flow in their\r\nmillions — or tens of millions, would perhaps be\r\nmore exact — from territories under the\r\njurisdiction of one State for the slaughter of\r\ninnocents in another.\r\n“Sri Lanka will, of course, continue in its\r\nactive role as the Chair of the General\r\nAssembly’s Ad Hoc Committee on the\r\nelimination of international terrorism, established\r\nby resolution 51/210, which was reconvened in\r\nFebruary 2001, with a view to concluding, under\r\nthe auspices of the Sixth Committee, international\r\nconventions on particular aspects of terrorism and\r\neventually developing an appropriate\r\ncomprehensive and focused international legal\r\nframework in the light of which Governments\r\nwould bring to justice those who are responsible\r\nfor acts of terrorism.\r\n“The world before 11 September was not\r\nalways encouraging to the Ad Hoc Committee.\r\nTwo examples should suffice to make that point:\r\nthe International Convention for the Suppression\r\nof the Financing of Terrorism, adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 9 December 1999, shows as\r\nof now only 44 signatories and just four States\r\nparties, of which Sri Lanka is one; the\r\nInternational Convention against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly, on 15 November 2000, shows as of\r\nnow 123 signatories and just three States parties.\r\n“We know also that our negotiations on\r\ninternational conventions, which often conclude,\r\nafter lengthy and exhaustive sessions, with\r\nlowest-common-denominator provisions leavened\r\nby ‘constructive ambiguity’, have not been as\r\neffective as they ought to be. They may salve our\r\nconsciences, but they contain loopholes through\r\nwhich millions of dollars could pass in\r\nquestionable transactions in the real world.\r\n“Yet that was the world we knew before 11\r\nSeptember. Let us hope that things will now\r\nchange for the better.\r\n“Sri Lanka, a party to all the major United\r\nNations conventions relating to terrorism, will\r\ncontinue to urge the widest possible participation\r\nin the international conventions that have already\r\nbeen formulated under the auspices of the United\r\nNations on a number of aspects of terrorism. Sri\r\nLanka will also pursue the fullest possible\r\nparticipation in the formulation of the\r\nconventions that remain on the agenda of the Ad\r\nHoc Committee on the elimination of\r\ninternational terrorism.”\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nMr. Dragonov (Bulgaria) (spoke in French): I\r\nwish first of all to convey my congratulations to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession and to wish him all success in his important\r\nmission. I also pay tribute to the President of the\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session, His Excellency\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, who enhanced the effectiveness of\r\nour work.\r\nMy deepest condolences go to the families of the\r\nvictims of the barbarous 11 September attacks, among\r\nwhom were citizens of many of the countries\r\nrepresented in this Hall. Bulgaria is full of admiration\r\nfor the outstanding courage of New Yorkers and of the\r\nentire people of the United States at this difficult\r\nmoment.\r\nBulgaria has already associated itself with the\r\nEuropean Union statement on terrorism; today I should\r\nlike to highlight a number of points on behalf of my\r\ncountry.\r\nWe are convened at New York for the first session\r\nsince the adoption of the historic Millennium\r\nDeclaration. But this is also a tragic moment marked\r\nby events that pose an unprecedented challenge to the\r\ninternational community and to civilization itself.\r\nIn the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist\r\nattacks against the United States, terrorism may be\r\nseen more than ever as a global threat to world order,\r\npeace and security. Clearly, terrorism undermines the\r\nvery foundations of modern society, which is founded\r\non the values of democracy, humanism and freedom.\r\nHence, our present debate does not deal solely with the\r\nfight against terrorism. We are discussing a deliberate\r\nattack on what the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nhas called\r\n“our shared values [and] everything this\r\nOrganization stands for: ... the very idea of a\r\nunited human family”. (A/56/PV.7)\r\nIt was an attack against mankind, and mankind must\r\ntherefore unite to conquer the forces that launched it.\r\nWe are convinced that the proper response would\r\ninclude the creation of a global system against\r\nterrorism. The United Nations must formulate a\r\ntargeted and effective mechanism to find legitimate\r\nways and means to prevent terrorism and to track down\r\nand punish terrorists, along with all those who support\r\nor back them. Bulgaria believes that terrorism in any\r\nform or manifestation is inadmissible, but it believes\r\nno less firmly that no region, nation or religion in the\r\nworld should be singled out. The scourge of terrorism\r\nthreatens all the world’s societies and countries\r\nirrespective of religion, belief or ethnicity. The\r\ncommitment of States and Governments from all\r\ncultural and geographic regions to act firmly against\r\nterrorism must be at the heart of the global response.\r\nAs an irreplaceable forum for formulating a long-term\r\nstrategy, the United Nations has a unique role to play in\r\neffecting that response.\r\nThe Republic of Bulgaria has consistently\r\ncondemned all forms of terrorism without exception,\r\nwhether they are national or international in origin,\r\nincluding those that seek legitimacy in political,\r\nreligious, ethnic or social arguments. My country\r\nstrictly adheres to the norms and principles set out in\r\nthe Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International\r\nTerrorism adopted in 1994 by the Assembly by\r\nresolution 49/60 and reaffirmed in Security Council\r\nresolution 1269 (1999). Bulgaria unequivocally stands\r\nby the United Nations in its support for the common\r\ninternational effort and in its condemnation of the\r\nrecent terrorist attacks, which may have targeted one\r\nnation but which wounded the entire world.\r\nIn a solemn declaration, the National Assembly\r\nof the Republic of Bulgaria voiced its firm support for\r\nthe establishment of a global coalition against\r\nterrorism. The parliamentary declaration states my\r\ncountry’s support for joint efforts to combat terrorism\r\nand recognizes that the fight against terrorism will be a\r\nlong-term priority.\r\nBulgaria welcomed the Security Council’s\r\nadoption of its resolution 1368 (2001), which\r\ncondemned terrorism in the wake of the 11 September\r\nattacks, with great satisfaction. In our view, Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which was adopted soon\r\nafterward, forcefully reaffirms the spirit of earlier\r\nCouncil resolutions and of the 12 universal conventions\r\nagainst terrorism. Because of its binding, obligatory\r\nnature, it constitutes a major step forward.\r\nThis resolution strikes in particular at the\r\nfinancing of terrorism and spells out with\r\nunprecedented clarity the obligations of States in this\r\narea. Funding is at the heart of every war, including\r\nthat which terrorism is waging against humankind.\r\nDrying up sources of financing is a task that will\r\ninvolve daily coordination and cooperation among\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nStates at all levels — national, subregional, regional\r\nand international.\r\nBulgaria notes with satisfaction that resolution\r\n1373 (2001) recognizes the serious nature of the\r\nsymbiosis that exists between terrorism and organized\r\ncrime. My country deems it of the highest priority that\r\nthe follow-up mechanism to the resolution functions\r\neffectively, and it intends to make its full contribution\r\nto that end.\r\nWe believe it imperative to create a clear, specific\r\nand consistent legal framework for the international\r\nwar on terrorism. As stated in resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nit is urgent that all States Members of the United\r\nNations become active parties to United Nations\r\nconventions in this field.\r\nFor its part, Bulgaria has now acceded to 13\r\nconventions, including all of those dealing with air\r\nsafety as well as the Convention on the Physical\r\nProtection of Nuclear Materials. On 19 March 2001,\r\nthe Republic of Bulgaria signed the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism, adopted by the General Assembly on 9\r\nDecember 1999. All necessary legal procedures\r\ntowards its ratification are now under way, so that\r\nBulgarian legislation can be brought into line with that\r\nConvention. All of the procedures for the early\r\nratification of the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings have also been\r\nundertaken.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm Bulgaria’s\r\ncommitment to acting together with Member States to\r\nforge a consensus against all forms of terrorism. We\r\nfervently believe that the United Nations must play a\r\npivotal role in this respect. As an active and\r\nresponsible Member of our universal Organization,\r\nBulgaria is ready to shoulder its responsibilities in the\r\nquest to create a safer and more prosperous world.\r\nMr. Baja (Philippines): The terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember were attacks on us all. We, as one\r\nindivisible human family, cannot allow the scourge of\r\ninternational terrorism to stand, first, because it is\r\ncowardly and deliberately indiscriminate, as it targets\r\ninnocent and defenceless civilians; secondly, because it\r\nis inhuman — a crime against humanity — and violates\r\nthe right of human beings to go about their daily lives;\r\nand, thirdly, because it is ineffective and senseless, for,\r\ninstead of intimidating us, it strengthens our resolve to\r\ncombat the viciousness of a few and to join together in\r\nrooting out this menace and bringing its perpetrators to\r\njustice.\r\nInternational terrorism is an aberration in the\r\npolitical framework of global cooperation. It thwarts\r\nthe aspiration of the international community to\r\nachieve a world of peace, harmony, equality and\r\ncharity. The irony was not lost on us that the attacks\r\ncame when the United Nations was observing the\r\nInternational Day of Peace and was poised to open the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the Assembly, whose key goals\r\nare to stanch conflict and promote peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe Philippines itself has been the victim of\r\nterrorist acts in the past, and Filipino lives were lost in\r\nthe 11 September tragedy. We condemn in unequivocal\r\nterms international terrorism, its perpetrators and its\r\nnetwork of supporters and sympathizers. We will\r\nactively join efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations, for terrorism is a threat to every\r\nsociety and nation.\r\nOur strong and unwavering stand against\r\nterrorism commits us to the responsibility clearly\r\narticulated by the President of the Philippines, Gloria\r\nMacapagal-Arroyo. In a policy speech last 26\r\nSeptember, President Arroyo announced the following\r\ncourses of action to manifest Philippine solidarity with\r\nthe global war against terrorism.\r\nFirst, the Philippines will join the international\r\ncounter-terrorism coalition.\r\nSecondly, we will work closely with the United\r\nNations and other members of the coalition on\r\nintelligence and security matters concerning terrorism.\r\nThirdly, if and when required, the Philippines will\r\nmake available its airspace and other facilities as\r\ntransit or staging points.\r\nFourthly, the Philippines is prepared to contribute\r\nlogistical support to the coalition in the form of food\r\nsupplies, medicines and medical personnel.\r\nFifthly, the Philippines, if asked and upon\r\nfulfilment of its constitutional and legal requirements,\r\nwill provide combat troops to the coalition.\r\nAnd sixthly, the Philippines will prevent the flow\r\nof funds to terrorist groups, particularly those operating\r\nin the country. Last Saturday, President Arroyo signed\r\nthe newly enacted Philippine law against money\r\nlaundering. Let this attest to our resolve to fight\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nterrorism on all fronts, in response to Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which the Council adopted last\r\nFriday, 28 September.\r\nThe impact of our involvement in the war against\r\nterrorism will be measured to a great degree by our\r\nown achievements in defeating terrorism within our\r\nterritorial boundary.\r\nWe are addressing our own home-grown terrorist\r\ngroup with full determination. Since our President\r\nannounced last July an intensified crackdown against\r\nthe Abu-Sayyaf group, more than 150 people have been\r\narrested or have surrendered, many of them ranking\r\nmembers. We will not relent in this campaign.\r\nIn a few weeks, the General Assembly, through a\r\nworking group of the Sixth Committee, will resume\r\nnegotiations on a comprehensive convention against\r\ninternational terrorism. These negotiations will be a\r\ncrucial test of our resolve to strengthen international\r\ncooperation against this evil.\r\nWe cannot afford to fail this test. We should build\r\nupon past successes, from the first legally binding\r\nConvention on Offences and Certain Other Acts\r\nCommitted on Board Aircraft, adopted almost four\r\ndecades ago, and through the 12 existing international\r\nconventions and various other international, regional\r\nand national instruments against this menace. We need\r\nto tighten the global legal regime. We need a\r\ncomprehensive convention in which the international\r\ncommunity can identify terrorism as a crime against\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe Philippine delegation stands ready to support\r\nfurther initiatives in the United Nations to eradicate\r\ninternational terrorism. To show our political will and\r\nresolve, the United Nations should begin seriously to\r\nexplore at the highest political level a global strategy\r\nthat will effectively deal with this problem.\r\nIn this regard, we must bear in mind that curing\r\nthe symptoms alone will not suffice; we need to\r\naddress the conditions that spawn and permit the\r\ngrowth of terrorism and hatred. It is also important to\r\nstrengthen international coordination on related issues,\r\nsuch as the sharing of intelligence, coordinated police\r\nactions, combating money laundering and the financing\r\nof terrorism.\r\nIt is without equivocation that the Philippines will\r\nextend full support to our common fight for democracy,\r\nfreedom and justice. Terrorists wish to instigate a\r\nreligious war. The terrorists who pose as Muslims have\r\nbeen denounced by true Muslims as traitors to the\r\nteachings of the Koran. Islam is a religion of peace,\r\nforbearance and tolerance. We must make this an\r\nopportunity to forge religious understanding,\r\necumenism and solidarity. As we do so, we must\r\nbroaden inter-faith dialogue to promote Christian and\r\nMuslim solidarity.\r\nWe should and shall fight terrorism together until\r\nit is eradicated.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): Three weeks ago, this\r\ncity experienced horrendous terrorist attacks that\r\nshocked the world. The Austrian Government reaffirms\r\nits unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations, whatever its motives and\r\norigin. Terrorism constitutes a threat to internal and\r\ninternational security, to peaceful relations between\r\nStates, to the development and functioning of\r\ninstitutions throughout the world and to the enjoyment\r\nof human rights. We confirm our steadfast\r\ndetermination to combat this evil. Terrorist attacks in\r\nwhatever form, for whatever reason and by whoever\r\ncommitted are criminal, unjustifiable acts.\r\nOn behalf of the Austrian Government, I would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to renew our deepest\r\nsympathies to the victims and their families and to\r\nexpress our total solidarity with our host city, New\r\nYork, and our host country, the United States of\r\nAmerica. 11 September was one of the darkest days in\r\nworld history. It is now our common obligation not\r\nonly to the victims, but also to future generations to\r\ndemonstrate that we do not accept terrorism and that\r\nwe stand up collectively against barbarism.\r\nThe events of 11 September have brought\r\nterrorism to the top of the international agenda. In\r\nlooking for effective, long-term global solutions, the\r\nworld turns to the United Nations for guidance and\r\nleadership. We all agree that the United Nations has so\r\nfar lived up to these legitimate expectations. The\r\nresponses of the Secretary-General, the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly were immediate.\r\nWithin 48 hours, resolutions strongly condemning the\r\nattacks and calling for action against the perpetrators,\r\nsupporters and financiers of terror were adopted.\r\nLast Friday, the Security Council adopted\r\nunanimously resolution 1373 (2001) to combat\r\nterrorism globally. That resolution demonstrates clearly\r\nthe unity, solidarity and determination of the United\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nNations in the fight against terrorism. Once\r\nimplemented, the resolution will cut off terrorists from\r\ntheir various forms of support and facilitate global\r\ncooperation to defeat this threat to the peace and\r\nsecurity of our nations.\r\nThe activity of the Security Council has been\r\ncomplemented and supported forcefully by the General\r\nAssembly. The scheduling of this plenary debate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly demonstrates the absolute priority\r\nthe family of nations gives to this issue. Again, the\r\nsense of unity, solidarity and determination to act is\r\noverwhelming. This debate proves our commitment to\r\ntaking measures for the immediate future to counter\r\nterrorism and to eliminate its roots, motives, resources\r\nand support. We are looking forward to a statement or\r\ndraft resolution by the President of the General\r\nAssembly to give clear direction to the work ahead of\r\nus.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to identify the\r\nmeasures which, from an Austrian perspective, are now\r\nessential in the global response to terrorism.\r\nFirst, all States must implement without delay\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28\r\nSeptember 2001, in close cooperation with the Security\r\nCouncil. Resolution 1373 (2001) is a powerful\r\ninstrument and must be applied prudently and\r\nresponsibly by all States.\r\nSecondly, all States that have not yet done so\r\nshould sign, ratify and implement the existing universal\r\nConventions against Terrorism. I am pleased to\r\nannounce in this respect that Austria, by signing the\r\n1999 International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nthe Financing of Terrorism on 24 September 2001, has\r\nnow signed all 12 universal conventions endorsed by\r\nthe United Nations. The other 11 conventions have\r\nalready been ratified by the Austrian Parliament and\r\nwe will ratify the Convention on the financing of\r\nterrorism very soon.\r\nThirdly, all States should redouble their efforts to\r\nfind consensus on the Indian-sponsored project of a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism. As the\r\nSecretary-General so rightly pointed out in his\r\nstatement yesterday, the necessity for legal precision\r\nmust not stand in the way of moral clarity, which\r\nrequires that we recognize no excuse whatsoever for\r\ntaking innocent civilian life.\r\nFourthly, during this session of the General\r\nAssembly, the Sixth Committee must attach the highest\r\npriority to agenda item 166 and ensure that the draft\r\nresolution on terrorism incorporates the important\r\ndevelopments in the United Nations that have occurred\r\nsince the tragic events of 11 September.\r\nFifthly — and this is a very important point —\r\nthe United Nations must pay particular attention to the\r\nbroader aspects of the fight against terrorism,\r\nespecially to the root causes, and contribute to a frank\r\nand inclusive dialogue between and within\r\ncivilizations. The United Nations is the ideal\r\norganization to meet this challenge and to develop\r\ncomprehensive strategies based on the multitude of\r\nexisting initiatives and projects in this field. One such\r\ninitiative, which Austria supported from the beginning,\r\nis the dialogue among civilizations. Just a few weeks\r\nago, at the Salzburg Dialogue among Civilizations,\r\nnew paradigms of international relations were\r\ndiscussed. There was consensus that additional efforts\r\nto counter intolerance and violence based on religion or\r\nbelief were needed. Without any doubt, the dialogue\r\namong civilizations and other initiatives against\r\nintolerance are more relevant today than ever before.\r\nSixthly, in paragraph 4 of resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nthe Security Council emphasizes the connection\r\nbetween international terrorism and transnational\r\norganized crime, illicit drugs and other illegal\r\nactivities. In this context, we welcome the statements\r\nof numerous delegations that have referred to the\r\nCentre for International Crime Prevention in Vienna.\r\nDelegations will be aware that, only one week\r\nbefore the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the\r\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\r\nadopted, by consensus, the Plans of Action for the\r\nimplementation of the Vienna Declaration on Crime\r\nand Justice. In chapter VII of that document, specific\r\nnational and international measures against terrorism\r\nare recommended.\r\nThe Centre for International Crime Prevention is\r\nthereby mandated to take steps to raise awareness of\r\nthe relevant international instruments and encourage\r\nStates to sign and ratify such instruments; to take\r\nmeasures to raise public awareness of the nature and\r\nscope of international terrorism and its relationship to\r\ncrime, including organized crime; to continue to\r\nmaintain existing databases on terrorism; to offer\r\nanalytical support by collecting and disseminating\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\ninformation on the relationship between terrorism and\r\nrelated criminal activities; and to draw up concrete\r\nproposals to strengthen its capacity to develop and\r\nadminister the terrorism prevention component of its\r\nactivities.\r\nWith these Vienna Plans of Action, the Centre for\r\nInternational Crime Prevention and its Terrorism\r\nPrevention Branch have received a focused mandate,\r\nwhich can serve as a solid basis for enhancing the\r\ncapabilities of the United Nations in the prevention of\r\nterrorism. The substantial changes in national\r\nlegislation required by Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) constitute a concrete example of a case in\r\nwhich the Terrorism Prevention Branch could\r\nimmediately provide assistance to States. To this end,\r\nits personal and financial resources will have to be\r\nstrengthened significantly. Taking into account the\r\nurgency of focused United Nations action, Austria will\r\nmake a substantial contribution to help the Terrorism\r\nPrevention Branch in its efforts to assist States with the\r\nimplementation of conventions against terrorism. We\r\nhope that other countries will follow suit in providing\r\nfinancial and other support to the Centre in Vienna. As\r\na further initiative, Austria will host a workshop on\r\nhow to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations\r\nby adopting a comprehensive approach in its fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nFinally, all States must support the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations by adopting additional measures at the\r\nnational level. In this regard, Austria will be guided by\r\nthe conclusions of the European Council meeting on 21\r\nSeptember 2001. Last week, the Austrian Government\r\ncomplemented that package of European counter-\r\nterrorism policies with a comprehensive national\r\nAction Plan on combating terrorist networks, which\r\nincludes provisions to enhance cooperation between\r\nStates and their law-enforcement agencies, to share\r\ninformation and intelligence, to track down terrorists’\r\nassets and to suppress the financial support of terrorist\r\ngroups.\r\nIn conclusion, let me stress once more that\r\nterrorism is an attack on humanity — on our values and\r\nour freedom. The Vienna Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action on human rights stipulate that acts, methods\r\nand practices of terrorism are activities aimed at the\r\ndestruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and\r\ndemocracy. It is our solemn duty to defend these\r\ncornerstones of our common humanity and to combat\r\nterrorism wherever it occurs. We owe this not only to\r\nthe victims of terrorism, but to all of our citizens and\r\nfuture generations, who deserve to live in a free, safe\r\nand peaceful world.\r\nMr. Ould Deddach (Mauritania) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I should like at the outset, until a more\r\nauthoritative voice can do so, to congratulate Mr. Han\r\non his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session and to assure him of\r\nthe full cooperation of the delegation of Mauritania.\r\nI should also like to express to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America and to the\r\ncity of New York, which affords our Organization such\r\ngenerous hospitality, the condolences of our delegation\r\nas well as of the Government and the people of\r\nMauritania.\r\nThe world is today facing a multiplicity of\r\nsituations and problems whose consequences go\r\nbeyond borders and threaten peace and security at the\r\nnational, regional and international level. They thus\r\njeopardize the progress that has been made towards\r\neconomic and social development. Terrorism is one of\r\nthe most contemptible manifestations of these various\r\nproblems. The recent events have served as a summons\r\nto the international community, which must fight\r\nterrorism with all the legal means that the human\r\nconscience will allow.\r\nThat is why, in the context of this tragedy, my\r\ncountry, which has always condemned and fought\r\nagainst terrorism, would like to reaffirm today more\r\nstrongly than ever our condemnation of terrorism,\r\nwhatever its origin and whatever form it takes. In this\r\nconnection, we also call upon the international\r\ncommunity to strengthen cooperation and coordination\r\nso that it can resolutely and forcefully combat this\r\nscourge. Furthermore, our Government has included\r\nthe struggle against terrorism among its chief policy\r\nobjectives, in the knowledge that only stability based\r\nupon the rule of law will allow for the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of our country.\r\nThe hateful crimes that were committed recently\r\nin front of our very eyes against the United States of\r\nAmerica have been rightly condemned by the entire\r\ninternational community, which has, for once, spoken\r\nwith unanimity. The Government and the people of\r\nMauritania, shocked by such unjustifiable atrocities,\r\nimmediately and unreservedly condemned those\r\nbarbarous acts and expressed their sympathy and\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nsupport to the grieving American Government and\r\npeople at this exceptional time.\r\nOur Government, of course, subscribes without\r\nreservation to Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)\r\nof 12 September and 1373 (2001) of 28 September and\r\nwe endorsed the General Assembly resolution of 12\r\nSeptember that condemned the terrorist attack on the\r\nUnited States. I should like to reaffirm to the Assembly\r\nthe resolute will of the Mauritanian Government to\r\nfully implement the provisions of Security Council\r\n1373 (2001). I should like to recall once again that that\r\nresolution fully accords with our Government’s desire,\r\nexpressed in the General Assembly, for the\r\ninternational community to commit itself to concerted\r\nand resolute action to effectively fight terrorism.\r\nFurthermore, in this regard, our Government has\r\ntaken an active part in all regional and international\r\ninitiatives aimed at jointly combating the phenomenon\r\nof terrorism. To this end, we have lost no time in\r\nsigning and ratifying certain legal instruments relative\r\nto the prevention and suppression of international\r\nterrorism. The international community can thus rest\r\nassured that in its struggle to totally eradicate terrorism\r\nit can count on the full cooperation of my country.\r\nMr. MacKay (New Zealand): We welcome this\r\ndebate at an early stage of this General Assembly\r\nsession, particularly as the general debate has been\r\npostponed.\r\nMay I again, on behalf of all New Zealanders,\r\nexpress our deepest sympathy to the families of the\r\nvictims of the attacks of 11 September, and to President\r\nGeorge W. Bush and the Government and people of the\r\nUnited States. We also pay tribute to Mayor Giuliani\r\nfor his inspirational leadership during these saddest of\r\ndays for this great city, and to its resilient people of so\r\nmany races and faiths.\r\nThree weeks ago we witnessed acts of callous and\r\nbrutal mass murder. The terrorist attacks here in our\r\nhost city, in Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania\r\nkilled many thousands of innocent people, men and\r\nwomen, young and old, even infants. No cause can\r\njustify these horrors, which were so meticulously\r\nplanned, coordinated, well funded and intended to\r\nattack the heart of our society. Those who assisted in\r\nany way with this evil should know that they have put\r\nthemselves beyond the boundaries of civilized\r\nbehaviour and humanity. None of us, acting alone, can\r\neradicate this scourge. Because its ramifications are\r\ntruly global, the foundations for an enduring response\r\nmust be laid as broadly as possible by the international\r\ncommunity, and this Organization should command a\r\nrole bestowed cooperatively and effectively by all\r\nGovernments.\r\nSince 11 September the General Assembly has\r\nadopted resolution 56/1, which, among other things,\r\nstressed the accountability of those responsible for\r\naiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators,\r\norganizers and sponsors of terrorist acts. And the\r\nSecurity Council has adopted two strong resolutions,\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), which\r\ntogether require every one of us to implement a wide\r\nrange of measures to prevent and suppress such acts.\r\nThe question now is what further value the General\r\nAssembly can add under the current item and through\r\nits Ad Hoc Committee on terrorism and the Working\r\nGroup.\r\nMember States have previously made\r\ncommitments in the General Assembly to tackle\r\ninternational terrorism, notably in the Declaration on\r\nMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism\r\n(resolution 49/60, annex). This Declaration, which\r\nelaborates on the application of the United Nations\r\nCharter to terrorist acts, strengthens the moral and legal\r\nfoundations for international action against terrorism.\r\nNew Zealand is convinced that international legal\r\ninstruments are a key element in combating\r\ninternational terrorism. The existing 12 international\r\ntreaties provide a strong framework for action and\r\ncooperation at the national and international level. All\r\nStates should become party to them as a matter of\r\npriority. We ourselves are attempting to fast-track our\r\ndomestic processes for becoming party to the terrorist\r\nbombing Convention and for ratifying the terrorist\r\nfinancing Convention, in response to the events of 11\r\nSeptember.\r\nBut possible gaps remain in that international\r\nframework, for example, in relation to the threshold for\r\nwhat is an “international” terrorist act. There are also\r\nquestions, possibly, about how far the Conventions\r\nextend to attacks on private facilities. My Government\r\nbelieves there is scope for more robust mechanisms for\r\ncooperation on the detection, prevention and\r\ninvestigation of terrorist acts than is found in some of\r\nthe earlier Conventions. We should also consider as a\r\nmatter of urgency the need for a comprehensive\r\nterrorism convention when the working group meets\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nlater this month. Such a convention might seek to cover\r\nthe gaps in existing instruments, while being careful to\r\navoid undermining or weakening them.\r\nIt goes without saying also that international\r\nagreements must be rigorously enforced by Member\r\nStates. Terrorists must be deprived of training, funding,\r\nsupport and shelter. Those States which assist or even\r\nknowingly tolerate the presence of international\r\nterrorists on their soil will have to face the\r\nconsequences.\r\nThe United Nations can contribute to the fight\r\nagainst terrorism in many practical ways, including by\r\naddressing the underlying causes of injustice that give\r\nrise to the killing of civilians all over the world — in\r\nEurope and Asia, as well as the Middle East. It is\r\nimportant to try to address the alienation of the young\r\nin situations of economic deprivation and political\r\ntension and uncertainty so that they do not, through a\r\nsense of injustice and lack of hope, become fertile\r\nground for terrorist recruitment.\r\nThe United Nations contribution can also involve\r\ninformation collection and exchange and technical\r\nadvice in best practice methods and technologies for\r\ncombating terrorism. The efforts of the Terrorism\r\nPrevention Branch of the Centre for International\r\nCrime Prevention, as well as the International Civil\r\nAviation Organization (ICAO) and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continue to be very\r\nimportant. They deserve enhanced political and\r\nfinancial support.\r\nThe battle against terrorism must be fought on\r\nmany fronts, because it is a complex phenomenon.\r\nMeasures to halt the illicit trade in narcotics and small\r\narms and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction are all part of the struggle. So are steps to\r\nimprove aviation security, to prevent money-laundering\r\nand to ensure the safety of hazardous — including\r\nchemical and biological — materials.\r\nThe alarm sounded on 11 September. We must\r\ncollectively confront the brutal and ruthless forces\r\nwhich drive international terrorism and ensure that the\r\ninternational community is protected in future from\r\nterrorist acts.\r\nFinally, like many who have spoken previously,\r\nNew Zealand is deeply concerned at the humanitarian\r\ncrisis in Afghanistan, which has been exacerbated by\r\nthe terrorist attacks of 11 September. I am pleased to\r\nannounce that on 1 October the New Zealand\r\nGovernment decided to provide a contribution of\r\n1 million New Zealand dollars to the United Nations\r\nConsolidated Appeal for Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Shobokshi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nThe disgraceful terrorist acts committed against the\r\nUnited States on 11 September 2001 were, by any\r\nstandards, ugly crimes. They should be condemned by\r\nevery person with a grain of faith, and by all peace-\r\nloving peoples who believe in human rights and uphold\r\nprinciples and values.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, its monarch,\r\nGovernment and people have condemned the criminal\r\nacts that resulted in great loss of life, tremendous\r\ndestruction and property damage. The Government has\r\nissued a declaration condemning this criminal act as\r\ncontrary to all religious values and humanitarian\r\ncultural concepts. The Custodian of the Two Holy\r\nMosques sent the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica a message in which he underlined his strong\r\ndenunciation and condemnation of such acts. His\r\nMajesty also conveyed his sincere condolences to the\r\nfamilies of the victims and to the friendly people of\r\nAmerica. He confirmed Saudi Arabia’s solidarity with\r\nthe international community in confronting terrorism\r\nand fighting it in all its forms and manifestations. In a\r\ntelephone conversation, His Royal Highness, the\r\nCrown Prince, First Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nCommander of the National Guard, conveyed his\r\ncondolences to the President of the United States and\r\nto the American people for the fallen victims of these\r\npainful acts of terrorism, acts condemned and rejected\r\nby all religious faiths. Prince Abdullah expressed Saudi\r\nArabia’s complete readiness to cooperate with the\r\nAmerican Government in all its efforts to uncover the\r\nidentities of the perpetrators and to bring them to\r\njustice.\r\nCondemnation of these criminal terrorist acts was\r\nnot limited to the official authorities; it included all\r\nsegments of Saudi society. The Grand Mufti — the\r\nchief Islamic jurist in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and\r\nChairman of the Senior Ulema, Islamic scholars —\r\naffirmed that the explosions that took place in the\r\nUnited States, the plane hijackings that frightened\r\npeaceful people, or unjustly killed people, were forms\r\nof aggression and oppression that Islamic law does not\r\ncondone. Indeed, it considers them a major sin.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nThe Chairman of the Supreme Judicial Council in\r\nthe Kingdom affirmed that the horrific, barbaric act\r\nthat took place in the United States was beyond\r\ncomprehension. Scenes of the carnage were beyond\r\nwhat any Muslim mind could accept or comprehend.\r\nHe added that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, home to\r\nthe Two Holy Mosques and governed by the teachings\r\nof Islam, condemned those brutal acts. So it is no\r\nwonder that the Kingdom considers it anathema for\r\nMuslims to commit such deeds or protect such\r\ncriminals. He said that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\r\nhad declared, through its religious leaders, before any\r\nSaudi aircraft was ever hijacked, that such acts were\r\ncriminal, regardless of whether the passengers were\r\nMuslim or not. They considered such acts to be\r\noppressive and said that aggression and terror against\r\npeople were among the greatest of sins.\r\nWhile my country denounces this inhumane\r\nterrorist act, it also emphasizes the need to avoid\r\nlinking terrorist acts with any particular religion or\r\nethnic group, whether such linkage is made by\r\nGovernment bodies or the news media. Such linkage\r\nwould not help in effectively combating terrorism, and\r\nis an affront to truth and reality. Saudi Arabia is\r\nconcerned about the attempts of some news media and\r\npoliticians to exploit this tragedy in order to arbitrarily\r\naccuse Islam and Muslims. Islam is absolutely innocent\r\nof such criminal acts; they are gross and flagrant\r\nviolations of Islamic values and moral principles.\r\nMy country is deeply concerned about certain\r\nwidespread phenomena in some societies that aim to\r\ndiscriminate against religious beliefs, especially Islam.\r\nThere is also an attempt to link Islam with some\r\nnegative phenomena, such as terrorism and fanaticism,\r\nforgetting that Islam rejects these anomalies, while it\r\npromotes tolerance and cooperation.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has suffered from\r\nterrorist acts in the past. Therefore, it sympathizes with\r\nwhat the United States is going through now. The\r\nKingdom has exerted sustained efforts for a long time\r\nto combat this dangerous phenomenon. We have taken\r\nappropriate measures on all levels. At the national\r\nlevel, we have enacted laws that punish perpetrators of\r\nterrorist acts. Combating terrorism became a principal\r\nsubject in the curriculum of our colleges and\r\nuniversities. At the regional level, the Kingdom was\r\namong the first signatories of the pan-Arab Convention\r\non the Suppression of Terrorism, which was adopted by\r\nthe League of Arab States in 1998. It also signed the\r\nanti-terrorism Convention of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference. At the international level, the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia has acceded to numerous\r\nUnited Nations Conventions relating to terrorism.\r\nThese include the Convention for the Suppression of\r\nUnlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation —\r\nthe Montreal Convention. The Kingdom is well on its\r\nway to acceding to or signing the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\r\nand the Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism.\r\nMy Government believes that accession to anti-\r\nterrorism conventions should be accompanied by\r\nsincere and serious intentions to combat this dangerous\r\nphenomenon and eradicate it. We call upon all Member\r\nStates to categorically condemn all terrorist acts that\r\nconstitute a grave violation of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations, threaten international\r\npeace and security and endanger friendly relations\r\namong States, as well as impede cooperation among\r\nthem.\r\nConcerned about this pernicious scourge, and\r\nbeing fully determined to combat it, the Kingdom of\r\nSaudi Arabia supports all efforts by our Organization\r\nthrough its relevant resolutions and conventions,\r\nparticularly Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)\r\nand 1373 (2001), both of which condemn categorically\r\nand in the strongest terms the horrible terrorist attacks\r\nthat took place in the United States of America.\r\nMy country’s delegation, in its efforts to combat\r\nthis dangerous phenomenon, supports the convening of\r\nan international conference on terrorism. We believe\r\nthat the need is urgent and that the time has come to\r\nconvene such a conference. It should have as one of its\r\nmain objectives an accurate definition of terrorism that\r\ndifferentiates between terrorism as a dangerous\r\nphenomenon posing a threat to the security and\r\nstability of the international community and the right\r\nof peoples to struggle against and resist occupation,\r\naccording to international law and the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nAlthough the Arab and Muslim peoples are\r\ntargets of terrorist acts, there are vicious attempts to\r\nfalsely accuse Arabs and Muslims of terrorism. Some\r\nbiased media repeat unjust hearsay about Islamic\r\nterrorism, an Islamic threat and an Islamic bomb. It is\r\nas if only Muslims commit terrorism. We have not\r\nheard or read that bombs have religions and terrorism\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nhas religious sects. Nobody would repeat such lies\r\nunless he or she was arrogant, malicious or ignorant of\r\nhistory. Arabs and Muslims cannot be accused of\r\nterrorism because some person or a group from among\r\nthem commits terrorist acts. Terrorists are found among\r\nevery sect and religion and in all human societies.\r\nIslam prohibits terrorism because God Almighty cannot\r\nbe but just and He forbids injustice against human\r\nbeings.\r\nGod criminalizes oppression and aggression\r\nagainst non-criminals. Killing the innocent is a major\r\nsin; it is considered similar to perversion on Earth and\r\ndestruction of crops and progeny. God Almighty says,\r\n“Let not\r\nThe hatred of others\r\nTo you make you swerve\r\nTo wrong and depart from\r\njustice. Be just: that is\r\nNext to piety.” (Holy Koran. V:8)\r\nIslam considers inflicting collective punishment\r\nan act of abomination, aggression and wickedness.\r\nIslamic law was aware of this danger 14 centuries ago.\r\nIt established the first complete law against terrorism.\r\nThus, Islamic jurisprudence considers oppression and\r\nbanditry as forms of terrorism. The Supreme Judicial\r\nCouncil in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia imposed\r\ncapital punishment on those who committed crimes of\r\nterrorism and sabotage. This was based on God’s words\r\nin the Holy Quran:\r\n“There is the type of man\r\nWhose speech\r\nAbout this world’s life\r\nMay dazzle thee,\r\nAnd he calls Allah to witness\r\nAbout what is in his heart;\r\nYet is he the most contentious\r\nof enemies.\r\nWhen he turns his back,\r\nHis aim everywhere\r\nIs to spread mischief\r\nThrough the earth and destroy\r\nCrops and progeny\r\nBut Allah loveth no mischief.”\r\n(Holy Koran. II:204, 205)\r\nGod Almighty says again,\r\n“That if any one slew\r\nA person — unless it be\r\nFor murder or for spreading\r\nMischief in the land —\r\nIt would be as if\r\nHe slew the whole people.” (Holy Koran. V:32)\r\nArab Governments and peoples condemn\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. This\r\nposition is based on their faith and culture.\r\nNevertheless, the Arabs call for avoiding any confusion\r\nbetween terrorism and the right of people to defend\r\ntheir independence, freedom and human rights when\r\nthey are subject to foreign occupation, dominance and\r\noppression, which are violations of international law\r\nand norms of conduct.\r\nGeneral condemnation of terrorism necessarily\r\nextends to State terrorism, as practised by Israel\r\ncontinuously against the Palestinian people. Paragraph\r\n6 of General Assembly resolution 40/61, adopted at the\r\nfortieth session in 1985, referred to official terrorism\r\npractised by some States. This resolution makes a clear\r\ndistinction between terrorism, which is a criminal act\r\nand an unlawful form of warfare, and armed resistance\r\nto colonialism, racism and foreign occupation, which is\r\na legitimate struggle based on the principle of self-\r\ndetermination, which is embodied in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, international law and other\r\ninternational resolutions. In paragraph 9, the resolution\r\ncalls upon all Member States to work, individually,\r\ncollaboratively and with relevant United Nations\r\norgans, towards the gradual elimination of the causes\r\nof international terrorism.\r\nThere is no doubt that States where terrorist acts\r\ntake place have the right to pursue the wrongdoers,\r\narrest them and put them on trial. The objective should\r\nbe to eradicate all forms and manifestations of\r\nterrorism not to exact revenge on the people. The\r\nhistory of terrorism shows us that the best way to\r\nsuppress it is to explore its roots, identify the causes\r\nthat engender it and find just solutions to the various\r\nconflicts.\r\nWhat happened in the United States places great\r\nresponsibilities before the international community.\r\nTerrorism was not born on 11 September 2001 and will\r\nnot be eradicated by military and security means alone.\r\nIt requires concerted efforts by the international\r\ncommunity to use all means available to fight this evil.\r\nThe international community is required to deal\r\nwith terrorism in all its aspects in a spirit of\r\nresponsibility and seriousness. The best context for\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nsuch action is the United Nations, which embodies the\r\ninternational community. It alone is entitled to define\r\nterrorism and to make international decisions to fight\r\nit. International law should be the basis for dealing\r\nwith terrorism and for deciding what measures to take\r\nagainst it. The mere use of force could lead to the\r\narrest of a few suspects while inflicting mass pain and\r\nsuffering on multitudes of innocent people.\r\nIn confronting terrorism, international\r\ncooperation in facing terrorism requires an agreed\r\ndefinition of the phenomenon in legal terms, not a\r\nwhimsical definition based on personal interests and\r\nobjectives. All faiths, creeds and values must be\r\nrespected and cannot be tarnished under the pretext of\r\ndefending freedom of speech. Human rights issues\r\nshould not be politicized, and attempts to impose on\r\nother nations values that might contradict their beliefs\r\nand principles should cease. No double standards\r\nshould be used in dealing with international problems.\r\nTherefore, international laws and legitimacy should be\r\nrespected.\r\nTerrorism has become a universal phenomenon\r\nthat is not limited to one ethnic group, people or faith.\r\nIt exists in every culture and in almost all States.\r\nCombating it also needs to be universal in nature and\r\nextent. Only through a coordinated plan in the context\r\nof the United Nations can our common efforts bear\r\nfruit, eradicate terrorism, protect the lives of the\r\ninnocent, maintain the sovereignty of States and the\r\nsecurity and stability of the world.\r\nMr. Al-Hinai (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is meeting today to discuss a matter\r\nof utmost importance and seriousness: measures to\r\neliminate international terrorism, which coincides with\r\npresent incidents and world developments that have\r\nnever before been witnessed. The world was shocked\r\nby the events of 11 September, and my Government\r\nwas stunned and deeply saddened by the terrorist\r\nattacks that took place in Washington, D.C., New York\r\nand Pennsylvania and the resulting human and material\r\nlosses.\r\nMy Government, while condemning these terrible\r\nacts, is confident that the American people will\r\novercome the suffering resulting from these terrorist\r\nacts. Expressing its complete solidarity with the United\r\nStates, my Government fully believes that justice will\r\nbe served on those who perpetrated these attacks, and\r\nthat the international community would undoubtedly\r\nstand with the United States to preserve the peace and\r\nsecurity of all peoples in the world in a more\r\ntransparent manner.\r\nI am greatly honoured in this context to quote His\r\nMajesty the great Sultan, may God preserve him, in his\r\nopening address at the regular session of the Council of\r\nOman on Tuesday, 25 September 2001, at which His\r\nMajesty said:\r\n“In foreign policy, the basic principle is to\r\nstand on the side of truth and justice and of the\r\nstrengthening of brotherhood and bonds of\r\nfriendship, and to participate in ensuring\r\ninternational security and peace. We are confident\r\nthat the establishment and maintenance of peace\r\nin the world are essential for the benefit of all\r\nmankind. Peace can be maintained among all\r\nnations of the world only when it is founded on a\r\nsolid basis of justice, cooperation and\r\nunderstanding among all countries. We are\r\nconvinced that all forms and manifestations of\r\nterrorism, and from whatever source, are an\r\nattack against peace, which is so cherished by all\r\nof mankind, and against international peace and\r\nsecurity, which we seek with other nations to\r\nconsolidate. Proceeding from this — as we have\r\nalways done throughout our blessed\r\nrenaissance — we condemn and reject terrorism.\r\nWe call upon all to counter terrorism and remedy\r\nits causes.”\r\nIn the light of these developments, it has become\r\nclear that terrorism is a world phenomenon that knows\r\nno borders and is not confined to specific geographical\r\nlocations. On the contrary, its activities are widely\r\nspread, come in numerous forms, and reach countries\r\nand peoples all over the world — especially with\r\ntoday’s increasing tendency towards globalization and\r\nthe attendant increase in the technological abilities to\r\ntranscend borders in an unprecedented manner. We\r\nmust, therefore, find the means to prevent this danger\r\nand root it out, so that terrorism is not allowed the\r\nopportunity to wreak havoc on the resources of nations\r\nand so that peace and prosperity may prevail in all\r\nparts of the world.\r\nFirmly convinced of the danger of terrorism and\r\nits negative effects on international peace and security,\r\nmy Government believes that combating this\r\nphenomenon can only be achieved through concerted\r\ninternational efforts and strengthening cooperation\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\namong States. My country has joined numerous\r\nconventions relevant to combating this phenomenon.\r\nAnd in this context, my delegation feels that attempts\r\nto combat terrorism will only succeed through the\r\ncommitment of all States to the principles and\r\nprovisions of international law and the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and through firm resolve in standing up\r\nto terrorism. This requires placing importance on\r\nmonitoring the implementation of all provisions of\r\nrelevant international conventions, especially given\r\nthat this phenomenon could become more dangerous\r\nand complicated in the light of the resurgence of\r\nextremist tendencies, whether they be national, ethnic,\r\nreligious or doctrinal.\r\nMy delegation also calls for the non-use of\r\ndouble standards in dealing with terrorist acts. It also\r\ncalls on States not to confuse such activities with the\r\nright of peoples to struggle against occupation and to\r\ndefend their land, because such a struggle is a right\r\nguaranteed under international law. At the same time,\r\nwe reaffirm that the principles of Islam and the\r\nteachings of its tolerant shariah call for tolerance and\r\nfor the renunciation of all forms of violence, terrorism\r\nand extremism. My delegation calls for the\r\nrenunciation of any link between terrorism and Islam,\r\nso that this war against terrorism not be transformed\r\ninto a conflict among religions and civilizations.\r\nWhile my delegation supports the efforts exerted\r\nto combat the phenomenon of terrorism, we hope that\r\nsuch efforts will not discourage the international\r\ncommunity from continuing its endeavours to find final\r\nand equitable solutions to numerous chronic questions.\r\nForemost among them is the Palestinian question and\r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict, especially in the light of the\r\nincreased acts of violence by Israeli forces against the\r\nunarmed Palestinian people, using the preoccupation of\r\nworld public opinion with the developments unfolding\r\non the international arena.\r\nFinally, my delegation, while reaffirming its\r\ncondemnation of terrorism, believes that it is of the\r\nutmost importance that an international conference be\r\nheld on terrorism, with the aim of considering the\r\nviews and proposals of countries, and in the hope of\r\neradicating this international scourge. We also reaffirm\r\nthe importance of concerted international efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism within the scope of international law\r\nand under the umbrella of the United Nations so that\r\nsuch efforts can be crowned with the desired success.\r\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing Djibouti’s deepest and most profound\r\nsympathies to the Government and people of the\r\nUnited States of America and to other nations and\r\npeople directly affected by the tragic events on 11\r\nSeptember.\r\nThe Government and the people of Djibouti\r\nswiftly and unreservedly condemned the terrorist\r\nattacks that took place in New York, Washington and\r\nPennsylvania on 11 September, and we vehemently\r\nexpressed our revulsion at such ghastly and evil acts\r\nperpetrated against innocent civilians. The resolve of\r\nthe international community was, and continues to be,\r\nunanimous, as demonstrated by the overwhelming and\r\ninstant reactions and decisive resolutions taken by the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. As stated\r\nby the American Red Cross, “Disasters create an abrupt\r\nchange in reality”.\r\nIndeed, we are living in a new reality. We need to\r\ncoalesce and fashion together new approaches to\r\ninternational peace, security and stability. We welcome\r\nthe timely Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nadopted last Friday, which demands that all countries\r\ndeny safe haven to terrorists, sever financial, political\r\nand military ties with terrorist organizations and freeze\r\ntheir assets everywhere.\r\nThe action by the Security Council last Friday,\r\nand the decision by the General Assembly to hold this\r\ncrucial meeting — both in the aftermath of those\r\ndeliberate and deadly attacks carried out against the\r\nUnited States — clearly underscore the emerging\r\ninternational determination and solidarity to fight\r\nterrorism. What happened on 11 September was mass\r\nmurder against innocent people of all nationalities,\r\nfaiths and walks of life. We are all touched. For most\r\nof us this could be the most dramatic thing that has\r\nhappened in our lifetime. We are all still in a state of\r\nshock and disbelief. As one doctor, overwhelmed by\r\nthe degree of the carnage, put it, there is a limit to what\r\nthe mind can take.\r\nAs so many have accurately described, 11\r\nSeptember was truly the day the world changed. The\r\nsheer heroism, selflessness and tireless efforts by so\r\nmany, including average New Yorkers and\r\nWashingtonians desperately seeking to save those\r\ncaught in the maelstrom, will forever form an indelible\r\nand inspiring memory in the hearts of mankind. It will\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\ntake us months, if not years, to fathom what has\r\nhappened. We are all changed by this calamity.\r\nAs nations and peoples, we have all suffered from\r\nterrorism at one time or another. In fact, many of us\r\nstill do, in the form of either domestic terrorism or\r\ninternational terrorism. Djibouti suffered from\r\nterrorism. It has also cared for victims of calamities\r\nand terrorism in other countries — the last instance\r\ninvolved the victims of the attack on the USS Cole, in\r\nAden. But it is perplexing how a terrorist group could\r\nturn aeroplanes into missiles and master the training,\r\nlogistics and coordination required to execute such a\r\nsinister plot. How they could do that for years without\r\nbeing detected boggles the imagination. The sheer\r\nmagnitude of this level of terrorism, its sophistication\r\nand its chosen instruments send a signal to the world\r\nthat a new day has indeed begun.\r\nWhile the Al Qaeda group, under the control of\r\nOsama bin Laden, is suspected to be the perpetrator,\r\nthe reality of terrorism goes far beyond any particular\r\nborder, faith, creed or political system. In the case of\r\nthe attack on America there was obviously a large,\r\ninternational network, huge hoards of cash and\r\nsufficient time and patience to target several American\r\nnational symbols for simultaneous destruction. Terror\r\non this scale was inconceivable, unseen and unheard\r\nof.\r\nGiven the sheer magnitude of these heinous acts\r\nof terrorism, the toll in human tragedy and the material\r\nand moral damage inflicted, we are today all united to\r\nwork together to eliminate terrorism. However, the\r\ncommitment to eradicate or contain terrorism — which\r\nis an ominous threat to peace, stability and security\r\neverywhere — is beyond the capacity of any one\r\ncountry.\r\nThe response of the Taliban movement in\r\nAfghanistan has so far been unclear, and at times\r\ncontradictory to the direction of the Security Council,\r\nwhich in its earlier resolutions demanded the handing\r\nover of the main suspect and the closing of all\r\nclandestine training camps in the territories under its\r\ncontrol. We strongly urge them to comply with all\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, including the latest one\r\nadopted on Friday, so that the question of bin Laden’s\r\nguilt or innocence can be judiciously established prior\r\nto the commencement of any hostilities in their\r\ncountry.\r\nThe people of that wretched country,\r\nAfghanistan, are once again gripped by desperation and\r\nfear as they flee the cities and towns because of the\r\npotential threat of attacks. A major disaster is shaping\r\nup. Millions of refugees are leaving the country, and\r\nmillions are facing starvation inside the country. The\r\nsituation is so serious that no one can say with\r\ncertainty what the extent of the looming crisis will be,\r\ngiven the impending strikes, severe food shortage,\r\nremoval of international aid workers and the closure of\r\nborders by all the neighbouring countries. We laud the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General to enhance\r\ninternational awareness about the plight of the Afghan\r\npeople and to prepare the ground for the impending\r\nexodus. His appeal for urgent humanitarian assistance\r\nneeds to be seriously heeded by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWhile these unprecedented attacks took place\r\nhere in the United States, there is widespread concern\r\nthat the next attack could be almost anywhere, with the\r\npossibility of multiple strikes. Such a possibility\r\nunderscores the need for collective, coordinated\r\ninternational preparedness and response. In such\r\nsituations separate and unilateral responses will be\r\nineffective, cumbersome and impossible to carry out\r\nunless there is a suitable international mechanism in\r\nplace. The sophisticated movement and training of\r\npeople, communications, funds and materiel require a\r\nrobust system of surveillance and monitoring.\r\nWe therefore concur with the Secretary-General\r\nin calling for a central role for the United Nations. The\r\nOrganization provides the forum necessary for building\r\na universal coalition and, equally important, ensures\r\nglobal legitimacy for the medium- to long-term\r\nresponse to terrorism. Additionally, there are a dozen\r\ninternational conventions and protocols in existence\r\ndesigned to address different facets of terrorism. They\r\nneed to be looked at all over again with a view to\r\nharmonizing and streamlining them. International\r\ncooperation cannot be seen as a formality, a rubber\r\nstamp, a routine, or a one-way street in which everyone\r\nis expected to comply, with the exception of a few.\r\nTerrorism of course does not exist in a vacuum.\r\nTherefore, beyond the issue of acts of terrorism and\r\nwhat must be done to prevent them, we need to focus\r\non the deep root causes and their accompanying\r\nattitudes, frustrations and attendant economic and\r\npolitical conditions. We need to examine the possible\r\nassociation with poverty, marginalization, economic\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\ndecline, political oppression, denial and repression. We\r\nmust direct extraordinary efforts toward resolving\r\nintractable conflicts, particularly the Palestinian\r\nquestion, which, without a doubt, is the breeding\r\nground for most manifestations of ill will,\r\ndisenchantment and despair.\r\nIf the new global order means anything to huge\r\nsectors of mankind, and if terrorism is to be\r\ncontained — if not prevented — then we must begin to\r\ndeal with the possible underlying causes in an earnest\r\nway. We cannot afford to brush them aside forever.\r\nIf, however, we fail to find the time and patience\r\nneeded to examine them seriously, then the world will\r\nindeed change, and not for the better. It need not be so;\r\nit cannot be so. That seems to be the message contained\r\nin the recent action of the Security Council, and the\r\nmeaning of this extraordinary series of General\r\nAssembly meetings on terrorism. If in the end we are\r\nsuccessful, even in a small way, in containing the evil\r\nphenomenon of terrorism, it will at least represent\r\nsomething positive emanating from the terrible tragedy\r\nin the United States.\r\nFinally, I wish to state again that the Government\r\nand the people of Djibouti firmly and explicitly stand\r\nwith the United States of America in particular and\r\nwith the international community in general in fighting\r\nterrorism.\r\nMr. Dangue Réwaka (Gabon) (spoke in French):\r\nThe terrorist acts perpetrated on United States soil on\r\n11 September 2001 strikingly remind us of the urgent\r\nneed for the international community to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nTo be sure, today’s item, entitled “Measures to\r\neliminate international terrorism”, has been on the\r\nAssembly’s agenda since 1972, but work towards the\r\nformulation and adoption of a binding international\r\nlegal instrument on this subject still remains to be\r\ndone. The numerous existing conventions on the\r\nsuppression of acts of terrorism can be useful reference\r\npoints here. In my view, completion of this task would\r\nhonour the memory of innocent victims of acts of\r\nterrorism worldwide.\r\nAt this solemn time my thoughts naturally go first\r\nto all the victims whose precious lives were callously\r\ndestroyed before the stunned and powerless eyes of\r\nmillions of television viewers on all continents on that\r\nday of infamy, 11 September 2001.\r\nLet me reaffirm the position of my country on\r\nthis item. Gabon most firmly and unreservedly\r\ncondemns terrorism in all its forms. Because it violates\r\nthe fundamental right of every human being to life,\r\nbecause it arbitrarily and indiscriminately strikes\r\ninnocent victims and because it feeds on the terror that\r\nit spawns, terrorism poses a genuine, grave threat to\r\npeace and security both for individuals and for nations.\r\nLet us make no mistake. Because of the myriad\r\nthreats it poses and its evil consequences in every\r\nsphere of international relations, including global\r\neconomic relations, there must be broad international\r\ncooperation to put an end to terrorism, its ramifications\r\nand the support from which it benefits. For its part,\r\nGabon is determined to join the rest of the international\r\ncommunity in all agreed initiatives to deal with this\r\nqualitatively new scourge. Our services are ready to\r\ncooperate with those of all other countries to that end,\r\nfor in the name of what cause could one reasonably\r\njustify the perpetration of large-scale terrorist crimes?\r\nHow can we accept, without renouncing universal\r\nhuman ethics, that the end can always and everywhere\r\njustify recourse to such extreme means? That is why\r\nwe are convinced of the need to accelerate the process\r\nof negotiations in the General Assembly’s Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee to draft a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nWe can already welcome the consensus that has\r\nformed on the need for an effective international anti-\r\nterrorism regime. Here, the international community\r\nmust act with dispatch and with unity. It is necessary\r\nand of the highest priority to search for effective\r\nresponses sufficient to slay this modern-day dragon.\r\nThe international community must now therefore focus\r\non this issue — but without omitting discussion of\r\nquestions of substance. We would hope to gain\r\nunderstanding so as to be able to take better action, but\r\nwithout engaging in justification. We need to\r\nunderstand in order better to restore the balance that\r\nmay have been disturbed.\r\nWe must therefore focus on this subject in a\r\nframework that is not only political, but also\r\nscientific — analytical and multisectoral — thus\r\nmaking it possible to attain a unified view of terrorism\r\nfrom all perspectives. Such a unified viewpoint can\r\nresult only from a comprehensive approach to the\r\nsubject. Here, we hail the international community’s\r\nefforts thus far, both in the General Assembly and in\r\nthe Security Council.\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.15\r\nBut we must note that the solutions proposed to\r\ndate have been fragmentary or limited. Their political\r\nnature has a considerable effect on their expected\r\neffectiveness, because they consistently depend on our\r\nvarious national legal systems for implementation. Our\r\nStates have different legal systems, apart from the fact\r\nthat they have freedom with respect to endorsing the\r\nrecommendations of the international community. This\r\nraises the question of the effectiveness of existing\r\nmeasures aimed at eradicating terrorism.\r\nIn the present context, the international\r\ncommunity must spare no effort to study terrorism in\r\ndepth. It is now or never: the international community\r\nmust adopt a coherent, practicable legal framework that\r\nwould address the entire structure of terrorism, from\r\nfact-finding to framing legal definitions to punishment.\r\nTo that end, a commonly accepted definition is needed,\r\nand we must articulate all the elements of the legal\r\nframework for the international community’s\r\nsuppression of acts of terrorism.\r\nThe General Assembly could convene a special\r\nsession for the definition of terrorism and could also\r\nrequest the International Law Commission to devote\r\none of its upcoming sessions exclusively to the\r\ntechnical aspects of a system for the suppression of\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
