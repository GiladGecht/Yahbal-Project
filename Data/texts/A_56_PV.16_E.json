(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 166 (continued)\r\nMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/160 and\r\nCorr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Koonjul (Mauritius): We are thankful to the\r\nMayor of the city of New York, Mr Giuliani, for his\r\ninspiring statement on Monday morning. We take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate to him and to the people of\r\nNew York our deepest sympathy following the tragedy\r\nof 11 September. We commend the people of the\r\nUnited States for the courage and resilience they have\r\ndemonstrated and continue to demonstrate following\r\nthe terrorist attacks.\r\nThe terrorist acts carried out on that fateful day in\r\nNew York and Washington, D.C., remind us of the\r\nvulnerability of all countries, regardless of their state\r\nof preparedness. No country is immune from this kind\r\nof attack. It is a reminder that terrorists can, at the most\r\nunexpected moment, hit at the very heart of a free and\r\npeaceful society, causing tremendous human and\r\nmaterial damage.\r\nIn the modern world of freedom, democracy and\r\ntolerance, it is simply unimaginable that some people\r\nchoose to have recourse to such evil methods to\r\nexpress any form of anger and frustration, if there is\r\nany at all. In fact, there is no justification whatsoever\r\nfor terrorism and no concession can be made to those\r\nwho commit terrorist acts. Terrorism is simply evil and\r\ninhuman. It flouts the principles and objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. As such, it is an ever-present\r\nthreat to international peace and security. This is why it\r\nis important for the international community and all\r\npeople who believe in freedom, justice, peace,\r\ntolerance and democratic values to take a determined\r\nresolve to combat and eradicate this scourge.\r\nWith the numerous international conventions on\r\nterrorism, one would have hoped that we had adequate\r\nmeasures at our disposal to deal with terrorism.\r\nUnfortunately, this is not the case. It goes on to prove\r\nthat either the instruments are not comprehensive\r\nenough or that, more importantly, we have failed in\r\nimplementing them fully and effectively.\r\nLast Friday, the Security Council took a bold and\r\nhistorical step by adopting the comprehensive and far-\r\nreaching resolution 1373 (2001) to deal with all aspects\r\nof terrorism in a global and holistic approach. The\r\nresolution, inter alia, calls upon Member States to\r\nbecome parties to the relevant international\r\nconventions relating to terrorism, including the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism of 9 December 1999. We urge\r\nall Member States to take immediate action to give\r\neffect to the provisions of the resolution.\r\nAll States must make a firm commitment to\r\nrefrain from providing any form of support, active or\r\npassive — including political, moral or diplomatic\r\nsupport — to any terror group, irrespective of the\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nideologies and convictions it represents. This is all the\r\nmore important in order to prevent terrorists from using\r\nthe territory of one Member State to perpetrate acts of\r\nterror in the territory of another State.\r\nTerrorists have no human or moral values, no\r\nrespect for human rights and, in fact, no religion. The\r\nonly religion they profess is to terrorize, maim and\r\ninflict maximum human suffering and material damage.\r\nIt is therefore important not to confuse terrorism with\r\nany ethnic group or religion. The fight against\r\nterrorism is a fight by all nations, and should be\r\nundertaken in the framework of international solidarity\r\nand cooperation. It must be as comprehensive and as\r\nbroad-based as possible, in terms of both action and\r\nsupport, if it is to be viable and successful. It must also\r\nbe carried out in accordance with international law so\r\nas to deny terrorists sympathy from any quarter.\r\nIt is time for each of us to take action at the\r\nnational level and for all of us, collectively, to take\r\naction at the international level, to pin down all\r\nterrorists and prevent them from planning and carrying\r\nout their shameful and heinous acts. In this regard, it is\r\nessential for all States to be able to fully implement the\r\nexisting conventions on international terrorism.\r\nLikewise, it is important that procedures for\r\ninternational search and arrest be harmonized in order\r\nto bring the perpetrators of terrorist attacks to justice. It\r\nwill also be very important for all States to cooperate at\r\nthe international and the regional level to exchange\r\ninformation and intelligence on the activities of\r\nsuspected groups.\r\nIt is important, however, to realize that many of\r\nus may not have the necessary expertise to frame\r\nappropriate legislation incorporating the provisions of\r\ninternational conventions into our own domestic laws.\r\nWe call on the Secretary-General and those countries\r\nwhich have such expertise to provide the necessary\r\ntechnical assistance to countries in need.\r\nWe are fully aware of the close and complex link\r\nbetween terrorism, organized crime, drug-trafficking,\r\nthe illegal exploitation of natural resources and the\r\nillegal trafficking and easy availability of small arms\r\nand light weapons. At the United Nations Conference\r\non the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\r\nin All its Aspects, held last July, many States rightly\r\npressed for the inclusion in the Programme of Action\r\nof measures that would stop States from selling small\r\narms and light weapons to non-State actors. Despite\r\nour efforts and determination, small arms and light\r\nweapons continue to get into the hands of terrorist\r\ngroups, rebels and other unlawful elements. Coming\r\nfrom the African continent, we daily witness the\r\nimmense havoc caused by such weapons. The recent\r\ntragedy has once more demonstrated that all nations\r\nshould act in a decisive and coherent manner to stop\r\nthe sale of small arms and light weapons to non-State\r\nactors. We cannot possibly achieve success in fighting\r\nterrorism if we do not take comprehensive steps to\r\nprevent all kinds of weapons, including biological,\r\nchemical and other weapons of mass destruction, from\r\nfalling into the hands of terrorist groups.\r\nWe are grateful to the delegation of India for\r\npresenting the draft comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism. We are equally appreciative of\r\nthe draft convention to combat nuclear terrorism,\r\nsubmitted by the Russian Federation. We support the\r\nproposals contained therein and hope that all Members\r\nwill approach both drafts in a constructive and\r\nproductive manner with a view to their early adoption.\r\nMy country has always been supportive of all\r\ninternational initiatives designed to combat\r\ninternational terrorism. We were among the first few\r\ncountries to sign the United Nations Convention\r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime last year. We\r\nrecently enacted the Economic Crime and Anti-Money-\r\nLaundering Act, which allows for the screening and\r\nconstant monitoring of all operations in our offshore\r\nsector. We have ratified a number of important\r\nconventions dealing with international terrorism, and\r\nwe are in the process of ratifying the remaining ones.\r\nWe once again pledge our full commitment to\r\nwork together with the international community to\r\neradicate forever terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations and make this world a safer place for\r\nfuture generations.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil): I should like to reiterate\r\nour profound sympathy for and solidarity with all those\r\nwho have suffered as a result of the tragic loss of life\r\ncaused by the grievous terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember. Those despicable acts were viewed with\r\noutrage in Brazil. Our thoughts go out to the victims\r\nand their families.\r\nThe attacks on the United States sought to sow\r\nfear and paralysis. They failed to do so. The sober but\r\ndetermined response of the American people has\r\ninspired respect and solidarity and helped forge a\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nglobal sentiment that the time has come to deal\r\ndecisively with terrorism.\r\nThe international community is meeting here to\r\nreaffirm our categorical condemnation of terrorism and\r\nlay out a comprehensive strategy to combat terrorism\r\nin all its forms and manifestations. There can be no\r\njustification whatsoever for terrorist acts. They are\r\ncowardly and barbaric acts that cannot be admitted\r\nunder any pretext, whether political, religious or\r\nideological. The perpetrators of terrorist attacks must\r\nbe brought to justice, along with those that provide\r\nthem with support and harbour them.\r\nThe Brazilian position on this issue is clear and\r\nunequivocal. The federal Constitution of Brazil\r\nestablishes the repudiation of terrorism and racism as\r\nbeing among the principles governing our international\r\nrelations. It also places terrorism among those heinous\r\ncrimes whose perpetrators cannot benefit from the\r\npossibility of bail, grace or amnesty.\r\nAs stated by the Brazilian Minister of External\r\nRelations, Ambassador Celso Lafer, the terrorist attack\r\non the United States on 11 September represented a\r\ndirect threat to all civilized nations and to our\r\ndemocratic values.\r\nBrazil endorsed the prompt action taken by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and by the Security Council in\r\ncondemnation of the attacks and reaffirmed our\r\ndetermination to combat terrorist actions with all\r\nmeans at our disposal, as such attacks represent a threat\r\nto international peace and security. We welcome the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1368 (2001),\r\nestablishing the foundations for concerted international\r\naction, and also the adoption last week of resolution\r\n1373 (2001), encompassing a set of measures under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter to enhance international\r\ncooperation in a vast array of areas, including measures\r\naimed at rooting out the far-flung networks of support\r\nand financing used by terrorists.\r\nWe must spare no effort to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of those resolutions, as well as to take\r\nany additional measures required by the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council. Brazil will\r\npromptly take all necessary measures to comply fully\r\nwith those provisions.\r\nWe must also reinforce our cooperative efforts at\r\nthe regional level in the fight against terrorism. In the\r\nface of the aggression against the United States, Brazil\r\nsupported the immediate convening of a ministerial\r\nmeeting of the Organization of American States.\r\nSpecific measures were then adopted to strengthen\r\nhemispheric cooperation in bringing perpetrators of\r\nterrorist acts to justice.\r\nAdditionally, Brazil took the initiative of\r\ninvoking the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal\r\nAssistance. In recognition of the fact that the terrorist\r\nattacks suffered by the United States represent an\r\nattack on all American States, the mechanisms for\r\nmutual assistance were called into force. It was also\r\ndecided, as a matter of urgency, that a draft inter-\r\nAmerican convention against terrorism be submitted to\r\nthe next General Assembly of the Organization of the\r\nAmerican States.\r\nThis commitment to strengthening our collective\r\nsecurity system in the face of terrorist threats builds on\r\nanti-terrorist measures adopted over the years at the\r\nregional and national levels. The Declaration and Plan\r\nof Action of Lima to Prevent, Combat and Eliminate\r\nTerrorism of 1996, as well as the Mar del Plata\r\nCommitment of 1998, laid the foundation for\r\nenhancing cooperation among the member states of the\r\nOrganization of American States. At the subregional\r\nlevel, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay have\r\nworked together effectively to integrate cross-border\r\ncounter-terrorist police and intelligence activities.\r\nWithin the wider framework of measures adopted\r\nover the years by the United Nations, more specifically\r\nthrough General Assembly resolutions 49/60 and\r\n51/210, we have created a network of interlocking\r\nconventions on judicial cooperation to ensure that the\r\nperpetrators of such crimes are held responsible. Brazil\r\nis taking measures to ensure that it is party to every one\r\nof these conventions.\r\nBrazil welcomed the adoption of the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism. It provides a novel and much needed\r\napproach in addressing the intricate financial schemes\r\nthat support terrorist activities. The Convention also\r\npaves the way for concerted preventive action between\r\nlaw enforcement and financial authorities around the\r\nworld. We also urge all delegations to decisively move\r\nahead in the negotiation of a comprehensive\r\nconvention against terrorism.\r\nThese initiatives give a clear picture of the\r\nsignificant ground already covered by the United\r\nNations in the struggle against terrorism. Yet this is\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nstill not enough. We must guarantee that such atrocities\r\nnever happen again. And for that purpose, as the\r\nSecretary-General stressed yesterday, it is urgent that\r\nthe United Nations develop a long-term strategy, in\r\nwhich every Member State will have a part to play.\r\nThis strategy must encompass actions on all\r\nfronts, from immediate repression to long-term\r\nprevention, including a comprehensive legal\r\nframework, as called for in General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/60. It must also rely heavily on the role\r\nof the Security Council in conflict resolution, as the\r\nsole international body entitled to authorize coercive\r\nactions.\r\nThe fight against terrorism will necessarily be a\r\ndifficult, drawn-out battle that goes beyond the\r\nrepression and prosecution of perpetrators. Repressive\r\nactions to crack down on terrorist cells are certainly\r\nnecessary. In many instances, they are the only\r\neffective means immediately available to restore\r\nsecurity and remove the imminent threat of terrorist\r\nstrikes.\r\nBut the tragic events of 11 September highlight\r\nhow essential preventive measures are in dealing with\r\nterrorist threats. Cooperative efforts must necessarily\r\ninvolve the sharing of information among intelligence\r\nagencies, strict border controls on suspected\r\ntransactions, the dismantling of the financial network\r\nthat supports terrorist activities, and enhanced security\r\nin transportation systems. The great strides in\r\ncommunications and transportation technology ushered\r\nin by globalization have made terrorist groups even\r\nmore elusive, including in their links to other\r\ncontemporary scourges, such as drug trafficking and\r\nthe illicit trade in arms.\r\nWe must also find the cooperative ways to cope\r\nwith the dramatic effects terrorist acts have on the\r\neconomies of all countries, big or small, as we have\r\nwitnessed in the past few weeks.\r\nTerrorism will certainly fail and reason will\r\nundoubtedly prevail if we ensure that the foundations\r\nof international stability are based on tolerance, justice\r\nand the pursuit of prosperity and peace for all. As\r\nPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso recently put it,\r\nwe must ensure that globalization does not become a\r\nsynonym for extreme inequalities, but rather a means to\r\nensure greater participation for all.\r\nUltimately, security lies in building a better, more\r\nequitable world around us. A world in which we make\r\nfull and effective use of the Charter instruments for\r\nconflict resolution and conflict prevention.\r\nWe fully agree with Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan that the United Nations is uniquely placed to\r\nface these challenges. It provides the forum for\r\nbuilding a global coalition that can legitimately\r\ndevelop a long-term response to terrorism and its\r\ncauses.\r\nThis debate offers an opportunity for the\r\ninternational community to demonstrate its resolve to\r\ndefeat terrorism. It should draw on the vast experience\r\nand know-how of the several relevant United Nations\r\norgans and specialized agencies, as well as regional\r\nand other organizations directly involved at all levels.\r\nThe international community should come\r\ntogether at this time to solemnly undertake certain\r\nfundamental steps that would signal our resolve to deal\r\ndecisively with the menace of terrorism. These might\r\ninclude the following: first, ensuring the universal\r\nadoption and full implementation of the existing\r\ncounter-terrorism conventions; secondly, redoubling\r\nefforts to conclude negotiations on the draft\r\ncomprehensive terrorism convention; thirdly,\r\nrequesting the Secretary-General to prepare a report\r\nrecommending measures to enhance the role of the\r\nUnited Nations, international agencies and regional\r\norganizations in combating terrorism; fourthly,\r\nadhering strictly to measures of non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and, particularly, implementing fully those\r\nmeasures contained in the international conventions on\r\nchemical and biological weapons; fifthly, considering\r\nadditional measures to enhance cooperation in such\r\nareas as border controls, financial institutions,\r\ninformation-sharing and law enforcement; and finally,\r\nensuring that the international response to terrorism, in\r\nparticular, when involving the use of force and the\r\nimposition of coercive measures, shall be guided by the\r\nprinciples set out in the Charter and in international\r\nlaw.\r\nMr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(spoke in French): I would like to add my voice to\r\nthose of other speakers at this tribune to convey to you,\r\nSir, my keen and heartfelt congratulations on the\r\noccasion of your election to the presidency of the fifty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nthat your wisdom, intellectual ability and diplomatic\r\ntalents will see us through to a successful conclusion of\r\nthis session tarnished by the terrible events of 11\r\nSeptember.\r\nAllow me to express my regard for the merit of\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri and congratulate\r\nhim for the know-how and ability with which he\r\ncarried out his difficult task during his presidency over\r\nthe fifty-fifth General Assembly.\r\nFinally, allow me to congratulate once more\r\nMr. Kofi Annan for his outstanding re-election as\r\nSecretary-General and to convey to him the full\r\nsupport of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for\r\nthe outstanding efforts he ceaselessly performs in the\r\ndefence of human rights and the principles and goals of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, and for his numerous and\r\npraiseworthy initiatives for peace and international\r\nsecurity throughout the world, and in my country, in\r\nparticular.\r\nThe present debate is additional proof, if such\r\nwere necessary, that the tragedy of 11 September 2001,\r\nwhich has plunged the American Government and its\r\npeople into mourning, does not affect Americans alone.\r\nThe great number of victims of widely varying origins\r\nsays much. There are also many among us whose\r\nrelatives or friends were among the victims.\r\nFrom the very first hours following the tragedy,\r\nHis Excellency Major-General Joseph Kabila,\r\nPresident of the Republic, expressed the full sympathy\r\nand solidarity of the Congolese population for their\r\ngood friends, the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica. On that occasion, he asked that the\r\nperpetrators of that horrible crime be located, brought\r\nto justice and receive exemplary punishment.\r\nWe deplore the horrendous consequences of this\r\ntragedy, which had proved once again — as if there\r\nwere any need to do so — that international terrorism\r\nis a matter of utmost seriousness and that joint action\r\non the part of the entire international community and\r\nall peace-loving States is required in order to put an\r\nend to it.\r\nMy delegation believes that the participation of\r\nthe entire international community in the struggle\r\nagainst this scourge depends on the commitment of all\r\nStates to respect international conventions in this area,\r\nthrough adherence to these instruments and the taking\r\nof the necessary measures at the national level to\r\nensure their full implementation.\r\nAlthough the provisions of our penal code do not\r\ninclude a clear definition of terrorism, as is the case in\r\na good number of countries, my country has always\r\nadvocated a policy of prevention and suppression of\r\ninternational terrorism, at the domestic, regional and\r\ninternational levels. At the domestic level — and this\r\nhas been the case since 21 February 1950 — the decree\r\ninstalling a regime for firearms and ammunition, as\r\namended, subjects to the authorization of the President\r\nof the Republic the importing of firearms, their deposit\r\nin State armories and public storehouses, their\r\nwithdrawal from these sites, and their transport,\r\ntrafficking, possession, licensing, donation,\r\nabandonment and sale. Since that time, Congolese law\r\nhas forbidden anyone who is not engaged in military\r\nservice to possess firearms, in particular revolvers,\r\npistols, submachine guns, rifles or any kind of\r\nautomatic firearm capable of firing in bursts.\r\nAt the regional level, my country is party to the\r\nOrganization of African Unity Convention of 14 July\r\n1999 on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism. In\r\nits foreign policy, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo understands that the use of force cannot settle\r\nthe problems confronting the world today and that in\r\nthe struggle against terrorism there is a need to create a\r\nuniversal conscience and a universal union that can\r\neliminate this scourge and others that threaten the very\r\nsurvival of the human race.\r\nIt is for this reason that my country has signed\r\nand ratified several global conventions dealing with the\r\nquestion of international terrorism. These include the\r\nTokyo Convention of 14 September 1963 on Offenses\r\nand Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft;\r\nthe Hague Convention of 16 December 1970 for the\r\nSuppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the\r\nMontreal Convention of 23 September 1971 for the\r\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of\r\nCivil Aviation; the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected\r\nPersons, including Diplomatic Agents, adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 14 December 1973; the\r\nInternational Convention against the Taking of\r\nHostages, also adopted by the General Assembly on 17\r\nDecember 1979; and the Montreal Protocol of 24\r\nFebruary 1988 for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of\r\nViolence at Airports Serving International Civil\r\nAviation, supplementary to the Convention for the\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of\r\nCivil Aviation.\r\nMoreover, consultations are now under way for\r\nmy country’s accession to other relevant instruments to\r\ncombat terrorism, including, inter alia, the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings,\r\nadopted by the General Assembly on 15 December\r\n1997, and the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, adopted by\r\nthe Assembly on 9 December 1999.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has\r\nalways advocated fighting terrorism in all of its aspects\r\nand manifestations. It therefore welcomes the adoption\r\nby the Security Council of resolution 1373 (2001) of 28\r\nSeptember 2001, which in our view is an important\r\nfirst step towards stemming and then eradicating this\r\nscourge. However, my delegation believes that a draft\r\nconvention for the suppression of acts of terrorism\r\nwould be of considerable assistance and would serve to\r\nsupplement significantly the existing anti-terrorist\r\nconventions and serve as an effective legal framework\r\nto fight and deter acts of terrorism. It would be\r\ndesirable for the delegations involved to moderate their\r\npositions so as to make it possible for the General\r\nAssembly to adopt this convention as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\nMy delegation also believes that the concept of\r\nterrorism must not be limited solely to acts carried out\r\nby individuals or isolated groups. It must cover a much\r\nbroader concept that also includes large-scale\r\norganized acts that States use as a political instrument,\r\nthe nature and consequences of which are extremely\r\nserious. It is this State terrorism, with incalculable\r\nconsequences, that countries neighbouring ours, having\r\ncrossed our borders in order to besiege the territory of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, in violation of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, are now practising against\r\nthe peaceful Congolese people with total impunity.\r\nIf the Congolese people and Government have\r\nhastened to demonstrate their solidarity with the\r\nfriendly people of the United States following the 11\r\nSeptember tragedy, it is because the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and its people have been living\r\nfor more than three years now with armed aggression\r\nand the occupation of their territory by those\r\nneighbouring countries, and are therefore aware of the\r\ngenuine meaning of the word “horror”.\r\nThe manifestations of that daily horror are daily\r\nmassacres of the civilian population, summary and\r\nextrajudicial executions, the deportation of entire\r\npopulations, the taking of hostages, hijacking, the\r\nillegal capture and destruction of aircraft, the\r\nsystematic rape and burying alive of women,\r\ndestitution, other serious violations of human rights\r\nand international humanitarian law, the deliberate and\r\ncriminal spread of HIV/AIDS, and so forth. Horror has\r\ntherefore become a familiar phenomenon to the people\r\nof my country because of the regular armies of those\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nAt the head of one of these aggressor terrorist and\r\nrogue States is an unbalanced individual who did not\r\nhesitate for one minute to commit his country to the\r\npath of State terrorism. This individual, who has\r\ncontinued to flout the entire Great Lakes region and the\r\ninternational community, bears primary responsibility\r\nfor the death of millions of Congolese citizens. He is\r\nalso at present the sole obstacle to the restoration of\r\nlasting peace and dignity to the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo. His hatred of the majority of his own\r\nfellow citizens does not allow him to see that the time\r\nis now right for the establishment and building of\r\npeace, justice and democracy in our region, for the\r\nbenefit, of course, of the peoples who live there.\r\nThe events of 11 September must be of the\r\ngreatest concern to us. At a time of such colossal\r\nsuffering and grief we need more than ever to renew\r\nour dedication to the cause of peace. My delegation\r\nbelieves that it is called for to speed up and rapidly\r\nconclude the debate on the adoption of a universal\r\ndefinition of terrorism, as well as to draw up a detailed,\r\ncomprehensive anti-terrorism convention. This idea has\r\nalready received the unanimous backing of the member\r\nStates of the Non-Aligned Movement, to which my\r\ncountry belongs, whose Twelfth Summit, held in\r\nDurban, South Africa, in 1998 reaffirmed the will of\r\nmember States to refrain from organizing or facilitating\r\nacts of terrorism on the territory of other States or from\r\nparticipating in them. On the same occasion, the\r\nSummit unequivocally condemned all political,\r\ndiplomatic, moral or material support for terrorism in\r\nall of its forms and aspects.\r\nAt its fifty-third session, the General Assembly\r\ndecided to convene a high-level conference in the year\r\n2000 to formulate an appropriate response on the part\r\nof the international community to the phenomenon of\r\ninternational terrorism and to all its forms and\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nmanifestations. So far that dream has not been realized,\r\nand my delegation has good reason to believe that the\r\ntime has finally come to give serious thought to this.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to pay a stirring\r\ntribute to Mr. George Pataki and Mr. Rudolph Giuliani,\r\nrespectively the Governor of New York State and the\r\nMayor of New York City, as well as to the population\r\nof the city, for their outstanding and responsible actions\r\nin the face of this terrible ordeal they are enduring.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe beginning of this session we welcomed the decision\r\nof the General Assembly to examine the item before us\r\ntoday and pledged our full and firm support so that our\r\nOrganization might assume its rightful role, with a\r\nfirm, vigorous and unequivocal stand with regard to\r\ntaking all measures necessary to combat and eliminate\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of our Charter and\r\nnorms of international law.\r\nThat decision of the Assembly resulted from the\r\ntragic events of 11 September, which cast into\r\nmourning not only the United States, but the entire\r\ncivilized world, and affected the security of nations.\r\nEvents of this nature are inconceivable and\r\nunjustifiable, and remind us of our vulnerability to\r\nindividuals and groups of individuals that commit\r\nindiscriminate and barbaric acts of violence\r\nunthinkable for civilized human beings. These horrible\r\nacts, whose extremely grave consequences affected\r\nmore than 80 nations, including Paraguay, which lost\r\ntwo of its nationals, have definitively changed the\r\ninternational context in which this new century is\r\nbeginning. Therefore, the community of nations must\r\nassume the firmest commitment and resolve for\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIt would be difficult to forget the moments of\r\npain, powerlessness and grief of millions of persons\r\nthroughout the world, of the families of the victims and\r\nof those who heroically lost their lives saving others,\r\nwhose distressing images were seen the world over and\r\nare still very much on our minds.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Paraguay, Luis\r\nÁngel González Macchi, expressed on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of my country, as soon as the\r\nevents became known, condemnation of and outrage at\r\nthe tragedy. He also expressed solidarity with the\r\npeople and the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica and the families of the victims. He pledged\r\nthe complete and resolute support of the Government\r\nof Paraguay for the United States Government in all its\r\nefforts to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators,\r\nas well as those who provide shelter to and support\r\nthese criminals. These acts are intolerable in the\r\nbuilding of an international order based on the\r\nprinciples of justice, international law and human\r\nrights. This is the opinion of the Government of\r\nParaguay. Thus we are not neutral, nor shall we be\r\nambiguous in the face of such a cowardly crime that\r\ntook so many innocent lives. We shall continue to\r\nsupport all the efforts of this Organization and the\r\ninternational community to root out these criminal\r\npractices.\r\nOn 23 September the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Paraguay, José Antonio Moreno Ruffinelli, went\r\nfrom Washington to New York to see what remained\r\nafter the brutal attack on the World Trade Center and,\r\nas one more citizen, to express his solidarity with New\r\nYork and the victims of this terrible tragedy.\r\nAs soon as the events occurred, the Government\r\nof the Republic of Paraguay adopted internal measures\r\nfor greater control and security regarding entry to and\r\ndeparture from our territory and for a broader exchange\r\nof information and greater coordination between the\r\nvarious Government departments, within the norms of\r\nour domestic law and those of freedom of movement.\r\nIn the framework of the judiciary, under the\r\nauspices of the Supreme Court of Justice, in close\r\ncooperation with the interior ministry, we are preparing\r\nand studying a preliminary draft of a law to include in\r\npenal legislation the definition of the crime of\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn the regional framework, Paraguay had the\r\nhonour of presenting to the Permanent Council of the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) the resolution,\r\nagreed by consensus by the 34 members, convening the\r\nTwenty-third Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of\r\nForeign Affairs of the hemisphere, with a view to\r\nurgent consideration of this subject within the OAS.\r\nParaguay also supported Brazil’s timely initiative\r\nto request the convening of the consultative body of the\r\nInter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, a\r\ncollective-defence mechanism of the American\r\ncountries. It was agreed there that terrorist attacks\r\nagainst the United States of America are considered to\r\nbe attacks against all the States of the hemisphere and\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nthat therefore effective reciprocal assistance must be\r\nprovided in order to counter such attacks.\r\nIn the subregional context, my country requested\r\nthe convening on 28 September of the Interior\r\nMinisters of the countries of the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) — Argentina, Brazil,\r\nParaguay and Uruguay — to undertake the broadest\r\npossible cooperation among ourselves and with other\r\ncountries for an exchange of information, studies and\r\nactions against terrorist activities; establish a standing\r\nworking group to evaluate joint and coordinated action\r\nagainst terrorism; and consider action to be included in\r\nthe regional security plan, in accordance with the\r\nresolution adopted by the Ministers of the Interior. The\r\nassociated MERCOSUR countries of Bolivia and Chile\r\nwere also invited to participate in this work.\r\nSince the twenty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, in 1972, the item on measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism has constantly, but timidly, been\r\non our Organization’s agenda. Various factors,\r\nincluding ideological ones that prevailed during the\r\ncold war, obstructed decision-taking and valid\r\nmeasures against the unjustifiable practices of\r\nterrorism. We have had to experience the tragedy that\r\nwe witnessed first-hand to mobilize a consensus on the\r\nurgent need to have a rapid and perhaps drastic\r\nresponse to these types of criminal acts. The damage is\r\nmeasured not only in the loss of thousands of lives and\r\nmajor losses to the international economy and finance.\r\nIn addition — and this, too, is a serious matter —\r\nthrough the technology of the communications media,\r\nwhich showed the entire world live and direct the\r\ndistressing images from New York, Washington and\r\nPennsylvania, an entire generation of children and\r\nadolescents has been marked by fear and insecurity;\r\nunable to find reasons, they ask themselves why these\r\ninhuman acts occurred and what kind of future awaits\r\nthem.\r\nOur Organization cannot wait another 30 years to\r\nfind an answer to how to confront and eradicate\r\nterrorism. It must also make every effort to take\r\neffective collective action to prevent and eradicate\r\nthreats to peace, as called for by the Charter.\r\nThe United Nations, through the resolutions\r\nadopted on 12 September by the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly, has reacted rapidly and\r\nunanimously with expressions of unequivocal\r\ncondemnation of the events of 11 September, and has\r\nthus given clear evidence of its determination to begin\r\nthe fight against this terrible evil. Last Friday the\r\nSecurity Council unanimously adopted resolution 1373\r\n(2001), which undoubtedly marks a new stage in the\r\nCouncil’s work, which, in fulfilment of the\r\nresponsibilities given to it by our Charter, shows its\r\nfirm resolve to contribute to the eradication of acts,\r\nsuch as those committed on 11 September, that\r\nconstitute a threat to international peace and security.\r\nThe resolution binds all States to unite and act jointly\r\nto combat all means of terrorism, the perpetrators, their\r\naccomplices and those who harbour them. In this\r\nrespect, Paraguay is determined to act in accordance\r\nwith the above-mentioned resolution and, in keeping\r\nwith the principles and norms of international law and\r\nits own internal law, to adopt measures and take actions\r\nthat are necessary for the effective implementation of\r\nthat resolution.\r\nIn the current circumstances, it is imperative that\r\nan international legal framework function effectively in\r\norder to prevent and respond to terrorist and criminal\r\nacts efficiently and rapidly. In this respect, we have a\r\nbasis of international conventions on the subject\r\nadopted under the auspices of our Organization.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Paraguay has\r\nauthorized me to sign, in the coming days, the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, adopted by this Assembly in\r\n1999, which, once adopted by our Congress, will be\r\npart of internal law in my country. Furthermore, my\r\ndelegation considers that progress must be made to\r\nconclude the two conventions that are now under\r\ndiscussion in the Sixth Committee: the comprehensive\r\nconvention on terrorism, submitted by the delegation of\r\nIndia, and the draft convention on nuclear terrorism, an\r\ninitiative of the Russian Federation. Any time that we\r\nmay lose in the strengthening of our legal framework\r\nwill be an opportunity for terrorists to increase their\r\nown power.\r\nThe fight against terrorism requires protracted\r\nand concerted efforts by the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community, just as it necessitates\r\nstrengthening and deepening international cooperation\r\nat every level. In this respect, we appeal to the\r\ndeveloped countries to give those States that so request\r\nthe needed assistance in technology and training and\r\nfinancial assistance in order to help them increase their\r\nanti-terrorist capacities. Likewise, my delegation\r\nbelieves it to be of fundamental importance to give the\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nrelevant units of the Secretariat the resources needed in\r\norder to strengthen and enhance their capacity to\r\ncollect and analyse information; it is equally important\r\nto give help to those countries that need cooperation —\r\nin particular, in order to implement the recently\r\nadopted resolution 1373 (2001) of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn conclusion, this General Assembly, the\r\nuniversal organ of the United Nations, must take the\r\npolitical decision to act collectively, effectively and\r\nconcretely in the face of the current circumstances, and\r\nassume its responsibility in the fight against terrorism\r\nin all its manifestations. The discussion on the issue\r\nthat is before us today must be a first step in that\r\ndirection. At this session the Assembly must go beyond\r\nmere statements of condemnation and solidarity. We\r\nmust pledge today — in a joint, coordinated and\r\nconcerted way, and for the medium and long term — as\r\nis expected of this Organization, to fulfil our moral,\r\nlegal and political obligation to construct, for ourselves\r\nand for future generations, a legacy of democracy,\r\nfreedom, peace and security.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): The course of human\r\nhistory was altered on 11 September when the world\r\nwas shocked into disbelief at the despicable acts of\r\nterrorism perpetrated in New York, Washington, D.C.,\r\nand Pennsylvania. This was an attack not only against\r\nthe United States but against all of humanity. Jamaica\r\ncondemns all acts of terrorism. We condemn those who\r\ncarry out such acts and those who provide terrorists\r\nwith support of any kind. My country, like many others\r\nin this Hall, suffered the loss of lives of our citizens,\r\nand we all grieve together. All acts of terrorism are\r\ncriminal and are contrary to societal norms. No just\r\ncause can be served by acts of terrorism.\r\nSince 11 September, the international community\r\nhas focused on the many challenges we face in dealing\r\nwith this scourge of the society of nations. So far, our\r\nactions have been resolute and unequivocal, but we\r\nhave only just begun. We have taken only the first\r\nsteps, albeit important ones. The true test will be the\r\nlevel of effectiveness achieved in implementing the\r\ndecisions we have already taken and those to come.\r\nOn Friday last, the Security Council adopted\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), reaffirming the will of the\r\ninternational community to rid the world of terrorism\r\nand, in so doing, to establish a legal framework for\r\naction by Member States. This decisive action by the\r\nSecurity Council followed that taken on 12 September\r\nby the Security Council as well as by the General\r\nAssembly, whereby we declared our intentions to work\r\ntogether to put an end to the scourge of international\r\nterrorism, which threatens international peace and\r\nsecurity. Terrorism threatens us all, and as recent\r\nevents have demonstrated, no member of the\r\ninternational community is far removed from its\r\neffects. It also confirmed our belief that international\r\nterrorism can be defeated only if we work together, in a\r\ncollective effort, to eliminate the sources of support for\r\nterrorists.\r\nWe believe that it is imperative for all nations and\r\nall peoples of the world to join in a concerted and\r\nunremitting course of action, or series of actions, to\r\ndefeat terrorism. We must reconfirm our commitment\r\nto ensure that those who carry out or support terrorist\r\nacts are once and for all brought to account. There\r\nmust be no refuge or safe haven for terrorists and those\r\nwho support, aid or abet them.\r\nWe must be guided by the principle established\r\nby the General Assembly in its resolution 2625 (XXV)\r\nof October 1970, which bears repeating:\r\n“Every State has the duty to refrain from\r\norganizing, instigating, assisting or participating\r\nin … terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing\r\nin organized activities within its territory directed\r\ntowards the commission of such acts”.\r\nThis is an affirmation of good-neighbourliness and\r\ncomity among nations. These are our basic obligations\r\nif we are to ensure that the rule of law and justice\r\nprevails throughout the global community.\r\nJamaica has stated in the past, and reiterates\r\ntoday, that the most effective response to these heinous\r\nacts continues to be full cooperation at the international\r\nlevel. It is in this context that we fully support the\r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive and effective legal\r\nframework to combat terrorism. This includes the work\r\nbeing undertaken by the Ad Hoc Committee on\r\nterrorism to draft a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism. Such a universally accepted\r\nlegal framework will provide for the level of\r\ncooperation and coordination recognized as essential\r\nfor effective action by Member States. We urge the\r\nCommittee to move quickly to decide on the major\r\noutstanding issues so that action on the convention may\r\nbe taken by the General Assembly at this session.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nThere are already a number of international\r\nconventions that provide a basis for concerted action\r\nagainst terrorism. Taken together, those legal\r\ninstruments provide a foundation for addressing\r\nterrorism through appropriate cooperation and\r\ninformation exchange. Jamaica is undertaking a review\r\nof those conventions with a view to signing and, where\r\nappropriate, ratifying and fully implementing those not\r\nalready in effect in our country. We urge all Member\r\nStates to do likewise.\r\nIn the meantime, there are a number of important\r\nsteps we can take to combat terrorism and the\r\nsupporters of terrorism. Globalization and the\r\nrevolution in communications technology, which now\r\ndefine much of our lives, have presented us with new\r\nchallenges in the fight against terrorism. In that\r\ncontext, last week Jamaica, along with a number of\r\ncountries from the Caribbean Community, signed the\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime.\r\nTransnational organized crime, which manifests\r\nitself in several forms of criminal activity — including\r\nillicit narcotics production and trafficking, money\r\nlaundering and illegal arms transfers — has taken\r\nadvantage of advances in technology to broaden its\r\nreach across international boundaries. The international\r\ncommunity must also take advantage of technological\r\nadvances and available expertise to wage our battle\r\nagainst terrorism. In advancing our cause, those who\r\nhave the know-how must be prepared to share it with\r\nthose who lack it. To that end, our focus must take into\r\nconsideration all aspects of terrorism and effectively\r\ndeal with all instruments at the disposal of terrorists.\r\nIn any consideration of terrorism particular\r\nattention must be paid to efforts aimed at countering\r\nthe traffic in small arms and light weapons, which\r\nundoubtedly contribute to the spread and escalation of\r\nterrorism. The international community must move\r\nforward in concert on this most important issue.\r\nThere are a number of immediate actions required\r\nof us as Member States. We must take action to prevent\r\nand suppress the financing of terrorists. We must\r\nremove their ability to move funds across borders to\r\nfacilitate their activities and to traverse the globe with\r\nsuch ease. We must deny access to funds used by\r\nterrorists and their supporters without delay. We must\r\nrefrain from providing any form of support at the State,\r\ngroup or individual level. We must eliminate all safe\r\nhavens for terrorists and their supporters. We must\r\nshare vital information necessary to work effectively in\r\na coordinated and cooperative international effort to\r\ncombat terrorism. We must serve the cause of justice\r\nby eliminating impunity for all terrorist acts, utilizing\r\nall lawful means at our disposal. We must always be\r\nmindful of the fact that terrorism largely visits\r\nsuffering upon innocent civilians — including women\r\nand children, who are often killed, maimed or orphaned\r\nas a result, thereby causing humanitarian tragedies.\r\nThe international community must now act\r\nresolutely and deliberately to secure a safe world for\r\nourselves and for the generations to come. We must act\r\nin step with each other, and together as the community\r\nof nations, in carrying out the decisions we take in the\r\nUnited Nations. We must assert and support the\r\nleadership role of the Organization in the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism. The Security Council has begun\r\nthe work necessary for effective action; the General\r\nAssembly must act likewise. Let us go forward from\r\nthis Hall united in our determination. Let us reaffirm\r\nour collective will and let our actions in pursuit of this\r\ncause surpass our words.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to associate the Jamaican\r\ndelegation with the statement that will be delivered\r\nlater in this debate on behalf of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity.\r\nMs. Rasi (Finland): I wish to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your election to preside over this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. You have the full\r\nsupport of the delegation of Finland in your very\r\ndemanding work.\r\nFinland fully subscribes to the statement made on\r\nbehalf of the European Union by the representative of\r\nBelgium, Mr. Jean de Ruyt, as well as to the\r\nconclusions and the plan of action adopted by the\r\nEuropean Council at its extraordinary meeting in\r\nBrussels on 21 September.\r\nWe condemn unequivocally the terrorist attacks\r\nin New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, and we\r\nexpress our solidarity with the United States. I also\r\nwish to express my Government’s deep sympathy and\r\nsincere condolences to the victims and their families,\r\nas well as to the people and Government of the United\r\nStates. The horrendous events of 11 September have\r\nprofoundly shocked all nations, big and small.\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nWhile those events were unprecedented and\r\nunimaginable in many respects, they also share a\r\nnumber of common traits with other terrorist attacks in\r\nrecent years. One such trend is the increasing lethality\r\nof the attacks. Their anonymity is another new\r\nphenomenon, as those who commit such acts rely on\r\nnetworks of undetermined groups and organizations.\r\nThe lack of discernible organizational structures and\r\npolitical programmes makes those groups and\r\norganizations invisible adversaries. The first, and by no\r\nmeans the easiest, challenge for counter-terrorism is\r\noften that of identifying and locating the adversary.\r\nAny Government’s ability to craft an effective\r\nresponse to terrorist attacks will, in those\r\ncircumstances, depend on international support,\r\ncoordination and cooperation. The European Union has\r\ncalled for the broadest possible global coalition against\r\nterrorism and has rightly emphasized the primordial\r\nrole of the United Nations in that respect. Terrorist acts\r\nconstitute a threat to international peace and security.\r\nThe resolutions and statements of the Security Council,\r\nin particular last Friday’s resolution 1373 (2001), send\r\na powerful message that terrorism must be combated\r\ndecisively.\r\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations has\r\ndone important and indispensable work in recent years\r\nto build a consensus on the basic principle that terrorist\r\nacts, wherever and by whomever they are committed,\r\nare criminal and unjustifiable by any political, religious\r\nor philosophical considerations. Terrorism may grow\r\nout of inequality and oppression, but such\r\ncircumstances do not justify terrorist acts. There is no\r\njust terrorism, whatever the causes. At the same time,\r\nunderstanding and eradicating the underlying causes of\r\nterrorism pose a challenge to societies and to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWhile terrorist organizations increasingly seek\r\ntheir inspiration in different religions, it is clear that no\r\nreligion can condone terrorism. The European Union\r\nhas categorically rejected any equation of groups of\r\nfanatical terrorism with the Arab and Muslim world.\r\nActs of terrorism pose a serious challenge to States and\r\nGovernments all over the world. It is the global reach\r\nof the problem that makes it necessary for the\r\ninternational community to respond to it in a\r\ncoordinated manner.\r\nWhile no category of response which is in\r\naccordance with international law can be excluded,\r\nefforts to suppress terrorism must always respect\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe 12 conventions elaborated under United\r\nNations auspices to prevent and suppress terrorist acts\r\nprovide an essential framework for the fight against\r\nterrorism. We join the call upon all countries to sign\r\nand ratify and to fully implement those conventions.\r\nFinland has signed all 12 conventions and will soon\r\nhave ratified 10 of them. The internal preparations\r\nrequired for the ratification of the two most recent\r\nconventions will be carried out as a matter of priority.\r\nThe 1997 International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings covers all attacks\r\nby means of explosive or other lethal devices,\r\nincluding radioactive materials and chemical or\r\nbiological agents and toxins directed against\r\ngovernment or infrastructure facilities, public\r\ntransportation systems or places of public use. It is a\r\nparticularly effective instrument which expands the\r\nlegal basis for international cooperation in the\r\ninvestigation, prosecution and extradition of persons\r\nwho engage in terrorist crimes.\r\nOrganizing the attacks of 11 September would not\r\nhave been possible without established transnational\r\nnetworks of support and funding. As a matter of fact,\r\nmost terrorist crimes would not be possible without\r\nfinancial resources from supporters. The 1999\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism acknowledges that those who\r\nfinance terrorist crimes are equally responsible and\r\nshould be treated as severely as those who commit the\r\ncrimes. The Convention applies to the wilful collection\r\nor provision of funds, legally or illegally, with the\r\nintention, or in the knowledge, that they are to be used\r\nfor terrorist acts. Once in force and fully implemented,\r\nthat Convention will significantly improve the ability\r\nof Governments to work together to reduce the threat\r\nof terrorism.\r\nEven though the scope of the existing\r\nconventions is fairly comprehensive, there are still gaps\r\nto be filled. The discussions on a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism, on the basis of a\r\ndraft text submitted by India, are under way in the\r\nSixth Committee. Such a convention would strengthen\r\nthe comprehensive network of conventions and would\r\nenhance the impact of the measures taken in the United\r\nNations over the past quarter of a century. All efforts\r\nshould be concentrated on the upcoming third round of\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nnegotiations on finding solutions that will make the\r\nconvention generally acceptable. The draft convention\r\nfor the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism should\r\nalso be completed as soon as possible.\r\nThe few weeks since 11 September have seen a\r\nunanimous condemnation of the terrorist attacks as a\r\nviolation of the fundamental values of the United\r\nNations. Success in the fight against terrorism will to a\r\nlarge extent depend on continued and continually\r\nstrengthened international cooperation. A whole array\r\nof different means — legal, law enforcement and\r\ndiplomatic — will be needed, along with close and\r\neffective cooperation at practical levels.\r\nFinland unequivocally condemns terrorism in all\r\nits forms and manifestations. We will participate both\r\nnationally and as a member of the European Union in\r\nformulating and implementing a coordinated and\r\ncoherent response to the threat of terrorism.\r\nThe President: I assure the representative of\r\nFinland that, in discharging my responsibilities as\r\nPresident, I shall do my best to follow the tradition set\r\nby her compatriot, His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri.\r\nMr. Aboud (Comoros) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\nwritten in the Holy Koran,\r\n“Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind,\r\nenjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong,\r\nand believing in Allah.” (III:110)\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAt the outset, my delegation would like to\r\nassociate itself with the statement made yesterday by\r\nthe representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on\r\nbehalf of the Arab Group. And, since my country is the\r\nvictim of occupation, my delegation fully supports\r\nwhat he said in that connection, that\r\n“we maintain that foreign occupation is the\r\ngreatest enemy of freedom — the freedom of\r\ncountries, peoples, territories and humankind.”\r\n(A/56/PV.14)\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI wish, on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros, to convey heartfelt condolences to the\r\nfamilies of the victims of the 11 September attacks and\r\nto the people and the Government of the United States.\r\nThrough our head of State, Colonel Azali Assoumani,\r\nthe Government of the Comoros has condemned those\r\nattacks on human dignity, and we do so again today.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, and on my own\r\naccount, I wish to say how delighted we are, Sir, to see\r\nyou presiding over the work of the General Assembly.\r\nThe highest authorities of my country will congratulate\r\nyou on your election in the course of the forthcoming\r\ngeneral debate. Now, let me reaffirm my delegation’s\r\nconfidence and support as you work to discharge your\r\nresponsibilities as President.\r\nThe work of the Organization has been seriously\r\ndisturbed in many respects. But, more than our work, it\r\nis our hearts that have been profoundly touched. In our\r\ndignity and our humanity, we have all been shaken by\r\nthe sad events of 11 September. The inhuman acts of\r\nrare barbarity that struck New York and other places\r\nwere intended to harm all of humankind.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, held last year in this\r\nvery Hall, our heads of State or Government evoked\r\nthe true cause of the terrorism that threatens democracy\r\nand freedom in all our countries. They concluded that it\r\nwas necessary to eradicate it by all means possible.\r\nHere, the Government of the Comoros is pleased at the\r\ndetermination shown by the Security Council. We\r\nunreservedly endorse the Council’s support for the\r\nstruggle against terrorism, and in particular last week’s\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (1201), which clearly\r\nand unequivocally condemns all acts, methods,\r\nfinancing and practices of terrorism, and which\r\nhighlights the need for the international community\r\neffectively and efficiently to respond to terrorism.\r\nOf course, to combat the globalization of\r\nterrorism — a scourge that transcends the geographical\r\nborders of our countries and that crosses all lines of\r\nreligion and custom — only international cooperation\r\nand solidarity can ensure the success of this vast\r\nenterprise. My Government believes that, in order to\r\neffectively combat this scourge, which threatens our\r\ncultures and our societies, integrated coordination on\r\nthe part of our States and, more specifically, within the\r\nframework of our universal Organization, is the most\r\neffective and reliable course ahead.\r\nMy Government urgently calls for cooperation on\r\nthe part of the international community in order\r\neffectively to fight terrorism in all its forms. Only\r\ninternational determination, in the context of respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms, will make\r\nit possible to put an end to these heinous acts. Indeed,\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nterrorism spares no region of the world and no sector of\r\nsociety.\r\nThe Government of Comoros believes that we\r\nmust urgently consider taking objective and concrete\r\naction aimed at combating the evil of terrorism by\r\ntackling its very roots. Regrettably, terrorism is not a\r\nnew phenomenon, but, in the conflagration of 11\r\nSeptember, it reached proportions that are beyond\r\ncomprehension.\r\nThe search for adequate, global and lasting\r\nsolutions must become a priority in the struggle that\r\nhas now begun against this evil. Towards that end, my\r\ndelegation endorses the statement made by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan at the opening of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession:\r\n“No effort should be spared in bringing the\r\nperpetrators to justice in a clear and transparent\r\nprocess”. (A/56/PV.7)\r\nThe clear, comprehensive and concise report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization,\r\nwhich warrants our full attention, should continue to\r\nserve as a crucial tool that will help guide our thinking\r\nand rationally direct our future work. My delegation\r\nsupports the broad lines underlying that document, and\r\nwe are glad to welcome and vigorously support the\r\nwise proposals of the Secretary-General.\r\nThe same concerns as in the past, unfortunately,\r\nare part of the picture. Conflicts seem to persist in\r\nmany regions. We recall the wisdom that prevailed at\r\nthe Millennium Summit, during which it was stated\r\nthat peace and international security could never be\r\ndissociated from the underdevelopment that prevails in\r\nmany of our countries.\r\nThe conflicts in these countries stem from diverse\r\ncauses that are related, to varying degrees, to problems\r\nof underdevelopment. This means that we need a\r\nmultifaceted response and that we must propose global\r\nand concrete action.\r\nThe need to intensify multifaceted international\r\ncooperation is clear. We must meet the challenges\r\nposed by the need to strengthen national and regional\r\ncapacities for sustainable human development.\r\nThe report of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme this year shows that we are still far from\r\nmeeting our objectives, even though the eradication of\r\npoverty by the year 2015 remains one of our priorities.\r\nPoverty, AIDS, problems related to public health,\r\nclimate change and the damage done to our\r\nenvironment, problems related to education and to the\r\nrights of the child, and terrorism — all of these\r\nquestions deserve our particular attention and adequate\r\nresponses. To this end, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and subregional organizations\r\nmust be as broad-based and intensive as possible.\r\nWe must extend, through concrete and consistent\r\noperations, the multifaceted presence of the\r\ninternational community in countries that have already\r\nbegun the process of détente, are seeing an\r\nimprovement in their situations and have already\r\nstarted out on the road of peace and reconciliation, in\r\nparticular Sierra Leone, Burundi, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Macedonia, and, to a lesser\r\nextent, the Comoros and its Fomboni reconciliation\r\nprocess.\r\nMy country, the Comoros, has been the victim in\r\nrecent years of continuing interference, through\r\nEuropean mercenaries, that has led to the successive\r\nassassinations of two heads of State. Another one was\r\ndeposed, and yet another was deported to an island in\r\nthe Indian Ocean. Not only that, but now we are\r\nplagued by the evil of separatism. Nonetheless, we are\r\nprepared to move forward.\r\nLet us encourage all of those countries, as well as\r\nthe Middle East peace process, to move ahead with\r\nstrict respect for the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nthe resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I should like to\r\nemphasize once again that my country is committed to\r\nthe fight against terrorism and will continue to combat\r\nit firmly, with strict respect for the principles of\r\ninternational law. We are prepared to support all\r\nregional and international initiatives to develop\r\ncooperation and coordination aimed at combating and\r\neliminating terrorism in all its forms.\r\nIn this context, my Government has taken\r\nnational measures, and it has also signed and ratified\r\ninstruments for the struggle against terrorism —\r\ninstruments prepared, inter alia, by the League of Arab\r\nStates, the Organization of African Unity, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation has always been in favour of\r\nequitable international justice. In this respect, we are\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nnow participating in the discussions of the eighth\r\nsession of the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, and we have pledged,\r\nafter having signed it, to ratify the Rome Statute in the\r\nnear future.\r\nOnce again the Government of the Comoros\r\ncondemns in the most forceful terms terrorism in all of\r\nits forms. We express our horror at such acts, which\r\nindiscriminately kill innocent civilians.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its support for the\r\nSecretary-General. We encourage him to pursue\r\nrelentlessly his fight for a world of peace and\r\ntolerance, and we invite all delegations of fraternal and\r\nfriendly countries to work together in their common\r\naspiration to maintain peace and international security,\r\nwith respect for the principles of human rights,\r\ndemocratic freedoms and good governance, in order to\r\nachieve harmony in the world and in the best interests\r\nof human civilization.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\ncannot begin my statement without expressing the\r\noutrage of the Peruvian Government and people at the\r\nbarbaric attack that we witnessed last 11 September.\r\nThat attack was conceived in such a machiavellian and\r\ncruel fashion as to take the largest possible number of\r\nhuman lives and cause the greatest physical damage\r\npossible.\r\nPeru, which has lost more than 25,000 human\r\nlives and valuable material resources to terrorism, and\r\nthe many other countries that are also victims of this\r\nscourge feel, as if it were their own, the pain,\r\nhelplessness and the indignation experienced by a\r\nnation when it is attacked in such an infamous manner\r\nby a faceless enemy. We therefore extend our solidarity\r\nand our sincerest condolences to the people and\r\nauthorities of the United States, and we wish them\r\nstrength and wisdom in overcoming these difficult\r\ntimes.\r\nWhile globalization has brought undeniable\r\nbenefits and advantages, it has also spread throughout\r\nthe world problems that once affected only certain\r\ncountries or regions. It is clear that the same thing has\r\nhappened as concerns the phenomenon of terrorism; it\r\nhas become globalized. Today, no country can be\r\nimmune to the devastating effects of terrorism.\r\nBut we must understand terrorism. It is a complex\r\nphenomenon. Fanaticism is often intimately related to\r\ndrug trafficking and common crime. We often cannot\r\ntell where crime begins and terrorism ends. This is a\r\nnew, difficult struggle that requires innovative and\r\nsophisticated methods. It can never, ever be won by\r\nmilitary force. It can be won by intelligence and by an\r\nalliance of the majority of citizens who seek to lead a\r\nsafe and decent life.\r\nTerrorism is the main violator of human rights\r\nand constitutes a crime against humanity. Its bloody\r\npractices, its innocent, random victims and its disdain\r\nfor human life make it entirely condemnable. Any\r\ncause that might be invoked to justify a terrorist act\r\nloses its legitimacy forever because of the inhuman\r\nmethods and nature.\r\nThe item of terrorism within the United Nations\r\nwas added to the General Assembly’s agenda in 1972.\r\nSince then, this subject has been discussed in this\r\nOrganization on two basic levels. First, various\r\nresolutions of political condemnation of terrorism have\r\nbeen adopted and, secondly, attempts have been made\r\nto establish a balanced legal framework to prevent\r\nmanifestations of terrorism, punish those responsible\r\nand reinforce international cooperation.\r\nAlthough 12 conventions have been adopted\r\nwithin this Organization against different aspects of\r\nterrorism, we note with concern that the number of\r\nStates parties to those conventions is far from\r\nrepresenting the broad consensus that supports the\r\npolitical messages rejecting and condemning this\r\nscourge. It is indispensable that, in the struggle against\r\nterrorism, the political discourse be reified within an\r\nappropriate legal framework. In this respect, special\r\nmention should be made of the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism, which seeks to combat terrorist activities in\r\ntheir most sensitive aspect: the supply, collection and\r\ntransfer of funds to support them. We hope that the\r\nprovisions of that Convention will enter into force as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nThe conventions that are still being negotiated\r\nwithin the Ad Hoc Committee established by resolution\r\n51/210 — the draft convention for the suppression of\r\nacts of nuclear terrorism and the draft comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism — must be\r\nconcluded soon in order to send a clear message of the\r\nshared resolve to defeat terrorism. Any delay in their\r\nadoption might send the wrong message of the\r\ninternational community’s weakness or lack of unity.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nIn designing the global legal framework against\r\nterrorism, the complexity and scope of the definition of\r\nterrorism should not and must not hinder the\r\ninternational community’s adoption of urgent, practical\r\nand effective measures to prevent and punish acts of\r\nterrorism and to establish appropriate punishment for\r\ntheir perpetrators. Among these urgent, practical\r\nmeasures in the struggle against terrorism, extradition\r\nmust be compulsory to facilitate the prosecution of\r\nthose who commit terrorist acts and of those who seek\r\nrefuge or protection in other countries.\r\nMy Government welcomes the recent approval by\r\nthe Security Council of resolution 1373 (2001), which\r\nestablishes a Committee to oversee a number of\r\nnecessary practical and effective measures with a view\r\nto the elimination of terrorism. In the near future, my\r\nGovernment will also report to that Committee on the\r\nmeasures it has taken and will take in the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism. We assure the Committee of our full\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn this struggle, possibly more than in any other,\r\nthe States need each other because of the unsuspected\r\nmagnitude of the networks for the preparation, supply,\r\nfinancing and sheltering of terrorist groups. In this\r\nscenario, international cooperation in intelligence,\r\npolice work, legal practice, the regulation of financial\r\ntransfers and extradition, inter alia, becomes simply\r\nindispensable. It is indispensable, but it is not enough.\r\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan affirmed recently,\r\nthe only way to face this common enemy is through\r\ncooperation and partnership among all the social forces\r\nof a nation: the State; the private sector, including\r\nbanks and financial institutions; the academic sector,\r\nwith its research capacities; and civil society, with its\r\nadvocacy of human rights in all forms.\r\nThe struggle that Peru waged against terrorism in\r\nthe past would have been easier and would have\r\nclaimed many fewer human lives had the international\r\ncommunity understood at that time the urgent need for\r\nthat partnership. In spite of this, we managed to\r\novercome terrorism and we are willing to place our\r\nown experience at the service of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nTerrorism so affected my own country that Peru\r\nconvened the First Inter-American Specialized\r\nConference On Terrorism in 1996. It culminated in the\r\nadoption of a Declaration in which the members of the\r\nOrganization of American States reiterated their most\r\nforceful condemnation of all terrorist methods and acts;\r\nwherever they are committed, whomever may be their\r\nagents and whatever the methods and motivation with\r\nwhich they attempt to justify them. At the same time,\r\nand in accordance with that Declaration, a Plan of\r\nAction to prevent, fight and eliminate terrorism was\r\napproved, serving as the basis for the subsequent\r\nestablishment of an Inter-American Committee on\r\nTerrorism at the Second Inter-American Conference on\r\nthe subject held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, in\r\nNovember 1998.\r\nRecently, at the twenty-third Meeting of\r\nConsultation of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the\r\nAssembly of American States held in Washington,\r\nD.C., on 19 September, a resolution was adopted that,\r\nin addition to forcefully rejecting terrorism, proposed\r\npractical measures to eradicate it. It notes that the\r\nstruggle against terrorism must be conducted — and\r\nthis is important — in full respect for the law, human\r\nrights and democratic institutions in order to preserve\r\nthe rule of law and democratic values and freedoms. At\r\nthat time, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru\r\nproposed the elaboration of an inter-American\r\nconvention against terrorism, which should contain\r\nclear obligations with regard to cooperation in the\r\nexchange of information and in the prosecution,\r\nextradition, judging and punishment of those involved\r\nin terrorist acts. Peru will continue to coordinate action\r\nat the inter-American level to make this convention\r\nagainst terrorism a reality as soon as possible.\r\nPeru has shown its commitment to the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism by recently undertaking a number of\r\ninternational measures in this respect, including\r\nsigning the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism; acceding to\r\nthe Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts\r\nagainst the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the\r\nContinental Shelf; acceding to the Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of\r\nMaritime Navigation; and acceding to the International\r\nConvention against the Taking of Hostages.\r\nFurthermore, the parliament of Peru is in the\r\nprocess of considering draft legislation to accede to the\r\n1997 International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings and to ratify the 1999 International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism.\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nPeru has always been involved in the fight against\r\nterrorism; we have suffered from terrorism and we\r\nhave overcome it. That is why we are ready to engage\r\nin intensive international cooperation to prevent acts of\r\nterror and punish the terrorists.\r\nMr. Widodo (Indonesia): My delegation deems\r\nthe convening of the General Assembly to debate this\r\nissue to be both timely and appropriate, given the tragic\r\nsequence of events on 11 September in New York,\r\nWashington D.C. and Pennsylvania. Even today, more\r\nthan three weeks later, the enormity and gravity of that\r\ncarnage is still becoming clear. Indonesia, together\r\nwith the rest of the international community, was\r\nshocked to hear that a great number of innocent people\r\nof many nationalities lost their lives or were wounded.\r\nLet me therefore take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nonce again the deepest sympathy of my Government\r\nand of the Indonesian people to the Government and\r\nthe people of the United States and to the other\r\ncountries directly affected, especially to the bereaved\r\nfamilies, in their hour of grief. Acts of terrorism such\r\nas these can never be justified, regardless of their\r\nobjectives; they violate the sanctity of human life and\r\nrun counter to the basic tenets of all cultures and\r\nreligious faiths.\r\nIndonesia has in the past condemned all acts of\r\nterrorism, in line with its consistent position that such\r\nindiscriminate violence can never be allowed to\r\nsubjugate the rule of law. As we are all aware, the\r\nscourge of terrorism is by no means a new form of\r\nillegal action. From the dawn of history, terrorism has\r\nafflicted many nations and societies, having a severe\r\nimpact on their economic and social development. In\r\nour contemporary world, with all its complexities,\r\nterrorism has become an intolerable menace,\r\nendangering peace, stability and harmonious\r\ncoexistence among States. Consequently, there is an\r\nurgent need to mount a universal response within a\r\nframework of concerted cooperation to rid our societies\r\nof this dangerous phenomenon.\r\nThe solemnity of the current deliberations reflects\r\nour profound concern that acts of terrorism, with their\r\nhorrendous toll in human lives and material\r\ndevastation, are tearing at the very fabric of civilized\r\nsocieties. They are incompatible with the principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter. Indeed, they go against the\r\nvery raison d’etre of this Organization, whose goal is to\r\nachieve peace, development and the rule of law;\r\nfreedom, justice and independence for all peoples;\r\nhuman rights, democratic values, good governance and\r\ntolerance; and understanding and cooperation among\r\nmembers of the international community, regardless of\r\nrace, religion or creed. These are the goals that all\r\nnations strive for and are committed to fostering.\r\nAs President Megawati Soekarnoputri has stated,\r\nthe recent tragedies underline the importance of\r\ninternational cooperation in eradicating terrorism\r\nanywhere in the world. Indonesia stands ready to\r\ncooperate. It is in this context that the United Nations,\r\nas the only multilateral organization with universal\r\nmembership, is uniquely placed to advance global\r\nefforts and to take necessary and effective measures to\r\ncombat this alarming increase in terrorist activity. It is\r\nthe only appropriate forum to accord legitimacy to\r\nundertaking the resolute action needed to eradicate this\r\nphenomenon. Our approach should, however, be based\r\non justice and fairness, rather than coercion and\r\nprejudice. We should guard against hasty decisions,\r\nwhich may prove to be counter-productive. As this is a\r\nglobal problem requiring a global response, the United\r\nNations can also reconcile disparate views and thereby\r\nharmonize efforts in a spirit of cooperation and\r\npartnership.\r\nAt the same time, it is important to underscore\r\nthat terrorism consists simply of indiscriminate acts of\r\nviolence aimed at the civilized world, and that attempts\r\nto depict it as a conflict between the West and the\r\nIslamic world are patently misleading and absolutely\r\nwrong. For Islam is a religion of peace that neither\r\nteaches nor condones violence. Indonesia has itself\r\nexperienced acts of terrorism emanating from\r\nseparatists and extremist movements. This is\r\nincompatible with our cherished objectives of national\r\nunity and with the territorial integrity and sovereignty\r\nof the Indonesian nation.\r\nIn the past, there has been strong evidence that\r\nthreats and acts of terrorism may either originate from\r\ninside the borders of the country affected or be cross-\r\nborder in nature. Hence, national efforts will not\r\nsuffice unless they are accompanied by regional\r\nendeavours. This is the principal reason why President\r\nMegawati Soekarnoputri recently visited neighbouring\r\ncountries in the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations to strengthen a regional approach. Such an\r\napproach has become crucial to eliminating\r\ninternational terrorism, which has often been found to\r\nhave close links to other transnational crimes, such as\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nthose of the illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons, money laundering and the trafficking of\r\nillegal aliens.\r\nIn the same vein, Indonesia considers\r\ninternational cooperation to be imperative. This should\r\ninclude the exchange of information and the training of\r\npersonnel to deal with transnational crime, with a view\r\nto augmenting capacity and institution-building and\r\nformulating legal mechanisms and instruments. At the\r\npresent time, my Government is in the process of\r\nbuilding upon, or has already established, such forms\r\nof cooperation with a number of countries. In this\r\nregard, Indonesia fully associates itself with the\r\ncommitments of the Non-Aligned Movement, as\r\ncontained in the Durban Declaration of 1998, which\r\nunderlined the need to adopt a collective position in\r\naccordance with the principles of international law as\r\nwell as respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of States. Moreover, it is the view of\r\nIndonesia that it is incumbent upon the Sixth\r\nCommittee to conclude its discussion on a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\non the basis of a draft submitted by India.\r\nIt is pertinent to recall that both the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council adopted resolutions\r\non 12 September 2001 that, among other actions, called\r\non Member States to redouble their efforts to prevent\r\nand suppress terrorist acts, including by increasing\r\ncooperation and by bringing to justice the perpetrators,\r\norganizers and sponsors of the recent attacks.\r\nFurthermore, on 28 September 2001, the Security\r\nCouncil, in its resolution 1373 (2001), inter alia, called\r\non all States to prevent and suppress the financing of\r\nterrorist acts by taking certain measures, including\r\nfreezing without delay funds and other assets used to\r\ncommit terrorism, calling on them as well to accede to\r\nrelevant conventions, such as the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism.\r\nMy delegation would also like to recall that only\r\nlast year the Millennium Declaration urged the Member\r\nStates to take concrete action against international\r\nterrorism and to accede as soon as possible to all\r\nrelevant conventions. Indonesia, for its part, is already\r\nin the process of ratifying relevant treaties. On 24\r\nSeptember 2001, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nIndonesia signed the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism of 1999.\r\nIn conclusion, as we are painfully aware,\r\nterrorism has taken a deadly and unconscionable toll\r\nand threatens to undermine regional peace, global\r\nsecurity and sustainable development. We are therefore\r\nduty-bound to eradicate this scourge once and forever.\r\nMy delegation remains hopeful that, together with\r\nmultilateral, regional and other cooperative efforts,\r\nincluding the participation of civil society, we will\r\nmake significant contributions to rendering our world a\r\nsafer and more secure place.\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to\r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am\r\nconvinced that your previous posts in your country and\r\nthe respect you enjoy will facilitate your task of\r\nguiding the work of this session to the desired success.\r\nMy delegation also has the pleasure of\r\nassociating itself with the statement made by the\r\npermanent representative of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya yesterday on behalf of the Arab group.\r\nWe meet here today at the United Nations, in\r\nNew York City, a city in mourning, which, several days\r\nago, suffered devastating terrorist attacks claiming\r\nthousands of innocent civilians.\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic has vigorously\r\ncondemned this odious crime committed against\r\nmankind. The President of the Syrian Arab Republic,\r\nMr. Bashar Al-Assad, moreover, sent a letter of\r\ncondolences to the President of the United States,\r\nGeorge Bush, emphasizing his complete condemnation\r\nand firm denunciation of this series of terrorist attacks,\r\nwhich shocked the world by their barbarism, their\r\ncontempt for human life and property, and their\r\nincompatibility with all religious, spiritual and human\r\nvalues. The attacks targeted innocent civilians and\r\ndeprived them of their most fundamental right, the\r\nright to a peaceful and safe life. These attacks struck at\r\nthe nerve centres of the United States and subjected\r\nthem to massive destruction.\r\nThe President of my country asked President\r\nBush and the entire world to lay down solid\r\nfoundations for international cooperation with the\r\nobjective of acting together to avoid a repetition of the\r\nevents seen here and throughout the world. He asked\r\nhim to work together in a spirit of genuine cooperation\r\nto eliminate terrorism wherever it may be and in all of\r\nits forms and manifestations.\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nInternational terrorism is nothing new. The\r\nattacks against New York, Washington, D.C. and\r\nPennsylvania are not the first of their kind. But, they\r\nwere genuinely devastating in their scope and impact,\r\nin both their human and material aspect. Their\r\ndisastrous consequences, in fact, have awakened the\r\ninternational community to the need to put an end to\r\nthis scourge.\r\nFor many years, my country, Syria, as well as\r\nnumerous Arab and other countries, has been subjected\r\nto terrorism. We have called on the international\r\ncommunity to condemn all forms of terrorism and, in\r\nparticular, State terrorism.\r\nToday, the entire truth needs to be told to this\r\nAssembly. Indeed, we cannot find a real remedy to the\r\nscourge of terrorism without revealing all the facts to\r\nthe international community. We would like to\r\nemphasize here that international cooperation to\r\ncombat terrorism has been insufficient. Many countries\r\nhave not fulfilled their international legal obligations in\r\ncombating terrorism. In this respect, the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic has played a leading role by proposing\r\ninitiatives to fight terrorism. In fact, the late President\r\nHafiz Al-Assad, in his concern to assure international\r\ncooperation, had as far back as 1986 proposed the\r\nholding of an international conference to define\r\nterrorism in order to distinguish it from the just and\r\nlegitimate struggle of peoples fighting for\r\nindependence and liberation. This is exactly what we\r\nare seeking today.\r\nThe General Assembly considered that proposal\r\nthen. All the summits of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, and\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental bodies endorsed\r\nthe initiative.\r\nUnfortunately, we have let a golden opportunity\r\nslip by. Once and for all, we can now take advantage of\r\nthis appeal in order to launch an unflagging war against\r\nterrorism, which has stricken New York, Washington\r\nand Pennsylvania, as well as cities in Africa, Europe\r\nand Latin America.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the Arab countries\r\nhave also made tireless efforts to combat the scourge of\r\nterrorism. Those efforts are reflected in the conclusion\r\nof a regional Arab Convention on the Suppression of\r\nTerrorism, the Convention of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC) on Combating International\r\nTerrorism and all the continued appeals made by Arab\r\nleaders to fight this serious scourge.\r\nSyria has always reaffirmed the need to act on all\r\nlevels to combat international terrorism, in accordance\r\nwith the purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter. We have also called previously upon all States\r\nto adopt the national, regional and international legal\r\nmeasures required to combat and eliminate the scourge,\r\nand to implement the norms of international law and\r\nrelevant international resolutions concerning the\r\nsuppression of terrorist acts, their financing, their\r\ninstigation, complicity in or tolerance of such acts and\r\nprotection of the perpetrators. We also wish to\r\nemphasize that in 1952 Syria was among the first\r\nStates to adopt strict measures within its own domestic\r\nlegislation to combat terrorism. We have also signed\r\nnumerous conventions with many States to combat\r\ntransnational crime and to coordinate joint action in\r\ncombating terrorism, illicit drug-trafficking and\r\nmoney-laundering.\r\nSyria would like to reaffirm the right of the\r\nUnited States, within the framework of the United\r\nNations, to pursue and bring to justice the perpetrators\r\nof these terrorist acts, and to do so through the various\r\ncompetent commissions and bodies, as well as to adopt\r\ncarefully calculated measures to combat terrorism.\r\nHowever, any action to this end must be accompanied\r\nby irrefutable proof and in-depth, clear and thorough\r\ninvestigation. Such action should not be aimed at entire\r\npeoples.\r\nForeign occupation is indeed one of the most\r\nappalling forms of terrorism. Therefore, resistance to\r\nsuch occupation, including Israeli occupation, is\r\nlegitimate — all the more so since in that occupation\r\nan attempt is being made to take advantage of the\r\npresent situation and the present state of grief to crush\r\nthe will of the Palestinian people to liberate\r\nthemselves. The continuation of the occupation\r\nrequires the international community to act\r\nimmediately to put an end to it. This must be done in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and international resolutions,\r\nand in compliance with the noble and moral religious\r\nvalues and principles that forbid the murder of civilians\r\nand innocent people in conformity with the principles\r\nof international law, which is based on the principle of\r\ncooperation among peoples for the establishment of\r\njust peace.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nSyrian actions are based on the universal legacy\r\nof the Arab countries, of which we are one. This legacy\r\nrejects all forms of violence and terrorism. We\r\nadvocate respect for the rights of all peoples, and we\r\nreaffirm the need not to link terrorism, Islam and\r\nArabs. This would in no way contribute to the\r\nelimination of terrorism or to a strengthening of\r\ninternational cooperation aimed at achieving prosperity\r\nand progress for all humankind. Our joint efforts and\r\nour cooperation must aim at dialogue among\r\ncivilizations in order to draw closer to each other, not a\r\nfight among civilizations that would serve no one’s\r\ninterests. Therefore, in order to put an end to terrorism,\r\nSyria is calling for genuine intensified international\r\ncooperation among civilizations within the framework\r\nof the United Nations. These necessary measures must\r\nbe taken to eliminate the permanent danger of\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic has acceded to\r\nnumerous regional and international conventions\r\nconcerning the war on terrorism. At present, my\r\ncountry is considering and making efforts to ratify\r\nother relevant conventions through our available\r\nconstitutional and legislative means. We believe that\r\nterrorism must be defined and that its root causes must\r\nbe dealt with. It must not be dealt with as a transient\r\nphenomenon; the underlying causes must be dealt with.\r\nThe international community is called upon to\r\nrejuvenate the peace process in the Middle East, a\r\nprocess that has been blocked by Israel because of the\r\ncontinuation of its occupation of the Arab territories,\r\nthe settlements and its rejection of all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, aimed at establishing a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nIn his statement of 24 September 2001, the\r\nSecretary-General declared that the United Nations\r\ncould play a fundamental role in the coordination of\r\ninternational efforts to combat terrorism. Syria would\r\nlike to state that it supports the effective role that the\r\nUnited Nations could play, particularly as regards the\r\nmobilization and coordination of international efforts\r\nin this field and in efforts to draw up a definition of\r\nterrorism on which everyone could agree.\r\nMr. Farouk Al-Shara’, the Syrian Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, emphasized that the events of 11\r\nSeptember were not ordinary ones. He expressed hope\r\nthat that day might become a historic turning point in\r\nthe history of nations, a turning point towards a better\r\nfuture. During his meeting with a delegation of the\r\nEuropean troika in Damascus on 27 September, he\r\nadded,\r\n“We have all been shocked; we have all given\r\nthought to this. We continue to give thought to\r\nthis and to what the world will be like today and\r\ntomorrow”.\r\nHe said that Syria, in fact, sympathized with those who\r\nhad perished and extended its condolences to the\r\nfamilies of the victims in the United States. He said,\r\n“Beyond the ruins, the ashes and the darkness, we\r\ncan see the light, a light of the salvation of\r\nmankind throughout the world”.\r\nMy delegation will cooperate with the Assembly\r\nto see that light and to ensure the success of your task.\r\nIndeed, international cooperation is imperative within\r\nthe United Nations in order to combat terrorism and to\r\ndefine it.\r\nMr. Da Fonseca (Cape Verde): All the preceding\r\ndelegations have tried to express from this rostrum\r\ntheir horror and condemnation in describing their\r\nfeelings about the heinous acts committed against\r\ninnocent and defenceless people, indeed against all of\r\nus, on the morning of 11 September.\r\nSome must have faced the same difficulty as my\r\ndelegation has in finding adequate words that can\r\ntranslate the revulsion and the pain we all experienced\r\nwhen it was clear that the tragedy resulted from\r\ncarefully planned and coordinated actions aimed at\r\ncoldly suppressing thousands of lives, allegedly to\r\nmake a point.\r\nSuddenly we discovered with horror that warped\r\nminds are able to plan and execute what we all thought\r\nunthinkable. It showed us how low some people can go\r\nor may be led to go in moral depravation.\r\nAfter 11 September 2001 all of mankind has\r\nbecome endangered. All over the world everyone is\r\nnow frightened of what may come next. For those of us\r\nwho witnessed with disbelief the unfolding events, we\r\nknow now that even worse tragedies may happen if we\r\ndo not put a definite stop to terrorism. It is our duty to\r\nwork so that they will never happen again.\r\nThe terrorist attacks on New York, Washington\r\nand Pennsylvania were evil acts indeed, criminal\r\nactions intended to carry an intimidating statement, but\r\nacts that proved self-defeating. They received clear and\r\nuniversal condemnation from every corner of the\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nworld. No one has tried to justify what was done, let\r\nalone praise it. No one has even claimed to be\r\nresponsible for organizing or planning, or even\r\ninspiring, the attacks. No organization has had the\r\ncourage to admit that it did it.\r\nThis is a clear defeat for the perpetrators, and it is\r\na sign of hope that the whole world has sent a\r\nspontaneous, united and strong message to those\r\ncriminals that terrorism will not be tolerated.\r\nThe head of State and the Prime Minister of Cape\r\nVerde have expressed their deep condolences to the\r\nAmerican Government and people and their heartfelt\r\nsympathy to the victims and their families. At the same\r\ntime, they have condemned in the strongest terms the\r\nperpetration of these heinous crimes. Similar feelings\r\nwere expressed by the leaders of all political parties. In\r\nmany parts of the country ordinary citizens gathered or\r\norganized demonstrations to manifest their grief and\r\ndenounce those barbaric acts. Two days of national\r\nmourning were declared.\r\nIn view of the events, the Cape Verdean\r\nauthorities implemented immediate measures intended\r\nto raise the level of security, specifically in and around\r\ninternational airports. Numbers of police personnel\r\nwere increased, and a new special detachment will be\r\ncreated to deal with airport security. Furthermore, the\r\nGovernment has declared its readiness to cooperate\r\nwith the international efforts aimed at combating\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Government is also studying closely\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) and is preparing to take the\r\nsteps to implement it. We are party to some\r\ninternational conventions and protocols to combat\r\nterrorism and expect to sign the remainder in the near\r\nfuture and work for their early ratification.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the authors of and\r\naccomplices to these crimes must be brought to justice,\r\nand all States should cooperate to this end. However,\r\ncaution should be used to ensure that no more innocent\r\npeople are added to the already too-long list of victims\r\nof those crimes and that nothing serves as a further\r\nexcuse for committing new acts of terror.\r\nMany delegations have indicated that, besides\r\nprosecuting and punishing the perpetrators of terrorist\r\nacts, it is necessary to deprive them of their breeding\r\ngrounds. A successful campaign to eradicate terrorism\r\nhas to address the long-term challenges that were so\r\neloquently enumerated in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nAs long as political, economic and social injustice are\r\nallowed to prevail there will always be people trying to\r\nexploit them for their narrow political agendas or\r\ncriminal purposes. As long as the international\r\ncommunity lacks the capacity to put an end to conflicts\r\nand address their real causes, there will be no shortage\r\nof recruits for all sorts of desperate acts.\r\nWhile adopting the necessary measures to\r\neliminate the threat posed by the activities of terrorist\r\ngroups, as well as their masterminds and supporters, it\r\nis important to ensure that the already scarce resources\r\nintended to promote the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of developing countries are not diverted.\r\nInstead, a stronger commitment should be made by the\r\ndeveloped countries, particularly in the least developed\r\ncountries, to help put an end to poverty, deprivation\r\nand marginalization.\r\nThis commitment should start now, by helping\r\ndeveloping countries face the additional burden\r\nbrought by their own effort to participate in the\r\ninternational campaign against international terrorism.\r\nBy redirecting a share of already scarce resources to\r\nincrease the level of security, their capacity for\r\naddressing the huge challenges of providing for the\r\nbasic needs of their impoverished populations is\r\nreduced.\r\nThe scope of the terrorist attacks heightens the\r\nneed for close cooperation among all States to\r\neradicate this scourge of our times. The United Nations\r\nshould play a decisive role in this cooperation by\r\nadopting effective measures and reinforcing the legal\r\nframework aimed at combating terrorism.\r\nMy delegation supports the calls made by\r\nprevious speakers urging the early adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism. We are aware\r\nof some difficulties, notably the definition of what\r\nterrorism is. But the urgency brought on by the events\r\nof 11 September should direct us to find the necessary\r\ncompromises that would enable the draft to be finished.\r\nAs the Secretary General has stated, there is also a\r\nneed for moral clarity, and,\r\n“There can be no acceptance of those who would \r\nseek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent \r\ncivilian life, regardless of cause or grievance.” \r\n(A/56/PV.12)\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nOn the other hand, it is the opinion of my\r\ndelegation that the Non-aligned Movement’s proposal\r\nto convene under the auspices of the United Nations a\r\nhigh-level conference to unite the international efforts\r\nand adopt a coordinated response to suppress and\r\neliminate terrorism is worthy of consideration by this\r\nAssembly. After 11 September 2001, no initiative\r\naimed at formulating a joint approach and a common\r\nresponse to face the terrorist threats should be\r\noverlooked.\r\nWe are presented with an unprecedented\r\nopportunity to show unity and resolve in tackling one\r\nof the most pressing challenges ever faced by our\r\nfamily of nations. The United Nations has a unique\r\nopportunity to assert its leadership and make a\r\nsignificant step forward in the direction of the\r\nobjectives set out in its Charter.\r\nMr. Kerim (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): Pleading for concerted action against\r\ninternational terrorism and for States’ urgent accession\r\nto all relevant international conventions, the\r\nMillennium Summit of world leaders anticipated the\r\nneed for a more effective and comprehensive approach\r\nwith regard to joint efforts and overall cooperation\r\nwithin the United Nations system.\r\nThe proceedings of this General Assembly debate\r\non agenda item 166 and the swift response by the\r\nUnited Nations in the aftermath of 11 September — the\r\nadoption of General Assembly resolution 56/1 and\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373\r\n(2001) — are a very convincing demonstration of the\r\nnew spirit of cooperation in the United Nations,\r\nplacing this anti-terrorism issue at the forefront of the\r\nOrganization’s agenda. This spirit is marked not only\r\nby the Security Council’s strong support for the United\r\nNations initiative of rapid and unanimous action, but\r\nalso by the commitments of various Governments and\r\nStates around the globe to join the anti-terrorist\r\ncoalition.\r\nAligning itself with the ranks of this coalition, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia, at a\r\nmeeting on 25 September, strongly condemned the\r\nterrorist attacks that took place on American soil, and\r\ndecided to join the global coalition against terrorism.\r\nAs far as the Macedonian contribution to the joint\r\naction in combating terrorism is concerned, my\r\nGovernment decided to prepare draft legislation on\r\ncombating terrorism and to amend already existing\r\nlegislation in this area, in order to comply with relevant\r\nregional and international conventions and other\r\ndecisions of the United Nations, thus acting in\r\ncompliance with the provisions of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001).\r\nFor its part, the Parliament of the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, in a declaration adopted on 11 September,\r\nexpressed its strongest condemnation of the terrorist\r\nacts and conveyed its deepest condolences and\r\nsympathy to the families of the victims, citizens of the\r\nUnited States of America and other countries.\r\nCondemning international terrorism as the worst\r\nhuman evil of our time, the consequences of which\r\nwere also deeply and tragically felt in the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, the Parliament expressed the readiness of\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia to cooperate with and\r\nparticipate in the international activities against\r\nterrorism, including through its initiative to establish a\r\nregional anti-terrorist pact.\r\nThe tragic and outrageous events of 11 September\r\non American soil left thousands of human victims and\r\nmillions of tons of debris and rubble in their wake. A\r\nclear message reverberated through all of us: fighting\r\nterrorism on a global front is a clear-cut imperative of\r\nour time.\r\nHowever, plunging into worldwide battle against\r\nterrorism means that we must at the same time\r\nrecognize that — as Secretary-General Kofi Annan has\r\nrightfully underlined — no religion, people or region\r\nshould be targeted because of the unspeakable acts of\r\nindividuals.\r\nFrom the point of view of the United Nations, the\r\nmost important question now is how to deal with this\r\nglobal threat while strengthening the capacity within\r\nthe Organization to carry out efforts aimed at\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWith regard to international terrorism, the\r\nexisting body of United Nations conventions already\r\nprovides for a solid international legal framework to\r\nimplement many of the steps that must be taken to\r\neradicate terrorism, including the extradition and\r\nprosecution of offenders and the suppression of money-\r\nlaundering. Fully implementing those conventions will,\r\nhowever, require changes in national legal codes, such\r\nas those dealing with border controls and asylum\r\npolicy.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nIn our view, the action to be taken should be two-\r\nfold. On one hand, all States that have not yet done so\r\nshould be urged to accede and/or to speed up the\r\nprocess of ratification of existing United Nations\r\nconventions. On the other hand, the Sixth Committee\r\nwill have the onerous task this year of intensifying its\r\nwork and efforts and of building consensus for the draft\r\nconventions pertaining to international terrorism that\r\nare under consideration. That includes building\r\nconsensus for a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism and concluding negotiations on\r\nthe draft convention for the suppression of acts of\r\nnuclear terrorism. The assistance and guidance of the\r\nUnited Nations Legal Counsel will be more than\r\nwelcome in this process. We also value the Declaration\r\non Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism,\r\nwhich is contained in the annex to resolution 49/60, of\r\n1994, as a good starting point upon which to build to\r\nthat end.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the\r\nunanimous adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) under Chapter VII of the Charter, and the\r\nsetting up of a Security Council Committee to monitor\r\nimplementation of the resolution by Member States.\r\nWe believe that the bitter experience gained by South-\r\nEastern Europe in recent years from the conflicts in the\r\nregion — including the ongoing crisis in the Republic\r\nof Macedonia — should be taken into account while\r\nimplementing resolution 1373 (2001). That experience\r\nclearly proved the inter-linkages that exist between\r\nterrorism, the illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons, organized crime, drug trafficking and money-\r\nlaundering.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is party to all\r\nrelevant United Nations conventions pertaining to\r\nterrorism. My country recently signed the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\r\nand the International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nthe Financing of Terrorism. The process of ratifying\r\nthose conventions is under way.\r\nAll nations are rightfully preoccupied with issues\r\nrelated to the aftermath of 11 September; but we must\r\nalso remember the need to address the conditions that\r\ngave rise to the growth of such hatred and depravity. In\r\nother words, the United Nations must continue its work\r\nand concentrate its efforts towards fulfilling the\r\nobligations and commitments contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. That is exactly why the\r\npostponed general debate of the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly is now of paramount\r\nimportance.\r\nThe conclusions to be drawn from the recent\r\nterrorist attacks on the United States must be clear.\r\nGlobalization and interdependence are bringing\r\nenormous benefits to all of us, but they are also\r\ncreating new strategic risks. Those risks include the\r\nvulnerability of globally integrated information and\r\ncommunication structures, the diffusion of potentially\r\ndangerous technologies, the combination of\r\nfundamentalism and political irresponsibility and\r\naccess to weapons of mass destruction. These are\r\nglobal challenges and can therefore only be managed\r\njointly, particularly in regard to fighting international\r\nterrorism. No State can guarantee security, peace and\r\nstability by itself. Cooperation and dialogue with\r\npartners must become a guiding principle of\r\ninternational security policy.\r\nAs the President of the Republic of Macedonia,\r\nMr. Boris Trajkovski, pointed out in his statement of 14\r\nSeptember,\r\n“terrorism strikes the large and the small, the\r\ngreat and the humble ... and it is only by\r\naddressing the roots of terrorism that we can\r\nbegin to eliminate it”.\r\nAs a country with an association and stabilization\r\nagreement with the European Union, Macedonia fully\r\nshares the views expressed by the representative of the\r\npresidency of the European Union, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Belgium. We agree in particular with\r\nthe statement that\r\n“ … strengthening international cooperation must\r\ngo hand in hand with strengthening regional\r\ncooperation. It calls for strengthened regional\r\ncooperation in the fight against international\r\nterrorism, as a matter of urgency.” (A/56/PV.12)\r\nIn that regard we welcome the adoption by the\r\nEuropean Council of a common definition of terrorism,\r\nand we call for a similar approach within the United\r\nNations system.\r\nIn concluding my statement, allow me to second\r\nthe proposal made by the representative of Ukraine to\r\ndeclare 11 September the international day of the\r\nstruggle against terrorism.\r\nMr. Schori (Sweden): Three weeks ago, within\r\nthe span of a few hours we witnessed an unspeakable\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\ntragedy and a most abominable terrorist attack. Our\r\nhost country and its people, and the international\r\ncommunity with them, were shocked and stunned by\r\nthe viciousness of those acts, targeting as they did\r\ninnocent civilians and extinguishing thousands of lives.\r\nI want today to convey Sweden’s condolences and deep\r\nsympathy to the families and friends of the victims. I\r\nalso want to express our sincere respect and admiration\r\nfor the individual acts of bravery during and after the\r\nterrorist attack, and for the way in which New York and\r\nits people are recovering from this tragedy.\r\nIn addition to causing insufferable pain and\r\ndamage on American soil and affecting citizens of\r\nnations worldwide, the attack of 11 September struck at\r\ncore values endorsed by the international community\r\nand embodied by this Organization: democracy and\r\ntolerance, openness and cooperation. Our response in\r\ndefence of these values must thus be unified and\r\nrelentless. In his statement on 1 October, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral noted that these vicious assaults had had the\r\neffect of reaffirming our common humanity. He also\r\nidentified the task ahead: to develop a broad,\r\ncomprehensive and, above all, sustained strategy to\r\ncombat terrorism and eradicate it from our world.\r\nSweden fully endorses the Secretary-General’s call,\r\nand looks forward to working with all Member States\r\nof the United Nations to accomplish that task.\r\nIt is only through determined and united action\r\nthat the international community can come to grips\r\nwith the evil forces of terrorism. Terrorists aim at\r\ncreating fear and uncertainty, and at provoking\r\nGovernments and other decision-makers. Our response\r\nmust be determined, carefully considered and well\r\ncalibrated. We should answer with resolve and unity,\r\nand ensure that similar events are never repeated.\r\nThe quick and unequivocal response of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council on 12\r\nSeptember, as well as the unanimous adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), last Friday,\r\nclearly illustrate the vitality and relevance of the\r\nOrganization in the fight against terrorism. In\r\nresolution 1368 (2001), the Security Council described\r\nthe acts of 11 September as a threat to international\r\npeace and security, and reaffirmed the inherent right of\r\nindividual or collective self-defence in accordance with\r\nthe Charter. My Government recognizes that right to\r\ntake measures of self-defence to prevent a similar\r\natrocity, and notes that any response would have to\r\nseek to avoid civilian casualties. As stated by the\r\nSecurity Council, our common objective lies in\r\nbringing to justice the perpetrators, organizers and\r\nsponsors of these attacks, and in redoubling our efforts\r\nto prevent and suppress terrorist acts, including by\r\nincreased cooperation.\r\nThrough its resolution 1373 (2001), the Security\r\nCouncil provided all Member States with a solid\r\nfoundation for the struggle against terrorism. Sweden\r\nwelcomes the resolve of the Security Council,\r\naffirming the central role of the United Nations in this\r\nendeavour. Resolution 1373 (2001) identifies a range\r\nof important measures to prevent and combat terrorism,\r\nincluding, among other things, stopping the flow of\r\nfinance and funds for terrorist activities, improving\r\ninformation exchange, eliminating the supply of\r\nweapons to terrorists, bringing persons involved in\r\nterrorist acts to justice, preventing the movement of\r\nterrorists and denying them safe haven.\r\nIn his statement of 1 October, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral observed that the implementation of resolution\r\n1373 (2001) will require technical expertise at the\r\nnational level, and he encouraged States to offer\r\nassistance in that regard. Sweden has taken note of his\r\ncall, and will look into the possibility of providing such\r\nsupport as a means of strengthening the global struggle\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nThe acts of 11 September — the worst mass\r\nkillings of innocents in the sad history of terrorism —\r\nconstitute not only a large-scale terrorist attack. My\r\nGovernment considers that those terrorist acts\r\nconstitute a crime against humanity, and that States\r\nshould bring the perpetrators to justice and punish\r\nthem. In that regard, I want to stress the importance of\r\nthe establishment of the International Criminal Court.\r\nThe Rome Statute opens a new chapter in international\r\nlaw that will certainly affect the conduct of States but,\r\nmore important, will guide and shape the behaviour of\r\nindividuals.\r\nI also want to stress the vital importance of the\r\nlegal framework provided by the 12 conventions on\r\ninternational terrorism adopted under United Nations\r\nauspices, and their protocols. Those instruments should\r\nbe signed, ratified and implemented worldwide without\r\ndelay. The Swedish Government has recently ratified\r\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings, and will within days sign the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nFinancing of Terrorism and will ratify it as soon as the\r\nlegal preparatory work is completed.\r\nEfforts should also be redoubled to finalize\r\nnegotiations on a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism, as proposed by India, and to\r\nmake progress in the deliberations on a convention for\r\nthe suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism, as\r\nproposed by the Russian Federation.\r\nThe tragedy of 11 September has highlighted the\r\nneed for intensified efforts to prevent the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction and their delivery\r\nvehicles. Sweden agrees with the statement by the\r\nSecretary-General a fortnight ago that progress in the\r\narea of nuclear non-proliferation is now more\r\nimportant than ever. Biological, chemical and nuclear\r\nweapons must not fall into the hands of terrorists. The\r\ninternational community must shoulder its\r\nresponsibility and find ways to strengthen and ensure\r\ncompliance with the Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Development, Production and Stockpiling of\r\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\nTheir Destruction, ensure the effective implementation\r\nof the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and\r\nreinforce the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nGreater efforts must also be made to prevent the\r\nuncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons.\r\nIn addition to fuelling armed conflicts, such weapons\r\nhave been used in numerous terrorist acts. The\r\nProgramme of Action adopted in July at the United\r\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects spells out a\r\nnumber of measures aimed at combating the illicit\r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons. The events of\r\n11 September have underlined the need for forceful\r\nfollow-up to the Conference.\r\nLet me end with this comment. There is a need to\r\nbetter address the underlying social, economic and\r\npolitical problems that create the human misery in\r\nwhich fanaticism and terrorism can grow and find\r\nsupport. Conflict prevention and resolution, as well as\r\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian assistance,\r\ntrade and investment and increased efforts for cross-\r\ncultural understanding are indispensable instruments in\r\na comprehensive long-term policy. In the coming year,\r\ntwo important meetings will take place at the highest\r\npolitical level: the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, to be held in Mexico, and\r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development, to be\r\nheld at Johannesburg. Let the events of recent weeks\r\nstrengthen our resolve to reach substantial and concrete\r\noutcomes at those meetings, for the benefit of\r\ndevelopment worldwide.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): On Monday, a few hours\r\nbefore the General Assembly began its debate on\r\nterrorism here, in India a suicide bomber drove his car,\r\npacked with explosives, into the compound of the\r\nLegislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, while\r\ntwo accomplices sprayed bullets at anyone in sight.\r\nForty people are dead so far, among them\r\nschoolchildren and women, and many more are injured.\r\nA terrorist organization called Jaish-e-Mohammed has\r\njubilantly claimed responsibility, naming the man who\r\ndrove the car.\r\nJaish-e-Mohammed was set up by Masood Azhar,\r\na foreign terrorist who was caught in India, tried and\r\nsentenced. Two years ago, an Indian Airlines plane was\r\nhijacked to Kandahar in Afghanistan by terrorists who\r\ndemanded his release and that of a few other terrorists\r\nalso in Indian jails. Using tactics that the world will\r\nnow find familiar, they slit the throats of passengers\r\nand threatened to kill the others. Very reluctantly, to\r\nsave innocent lives, we handed over the convicted\r\nterrorists to the Taliban in Kandahar; the hijackers and\r\ntheir prizes then disappeared into Taliban-held\r\nterritory, from where they have since reappeared to kill,\r\nterrorize and incite to terrorism.\r\nThe terrible events of 11 September brought\r\nhome to a world that probably did not realize this until\r\nthen how much of an international phenomenon\r\nterrorism truly is: international in its organization and\r\ninternational in its effects. We should remember that as\r\nwe take up the agenda item entitled “Measures to\r\neliminate international terrorism”. We understand from\r\nreports in the Western media that at least one of the\r\nterrorists we were forced to free in Kandahar is under\r\nsuspicion for the attacks on the World Trade Center.\r\nThe prime suspect, Osama bin Laden, based in\r\nAfghanistan, recruited his terrorists from West Asia\r\nand North Africa, sent some of them to Europe to plan\r\nand prepare, and carried out an act of monumental\r\ncruelty in North America. While the target was the\r\nUnited States — and its citizens bore the brunt —\r\nindividuals from all parts of the world were among the\r\nvictims: 250 Indian citizens are still missing. Over the\r\npast decade, terrorists have killed tens of thousands in\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nalmost daily attacks in India, but very few incidents\r\nhave taken as heavy a toll of Indian lives as this did.\r\nThe fact that terrorism is an international problem\r\nand can only be tackled collectively is something that\r\ncountries that have suffered most from it know in their\r\nbones and that they have urged upon the rest of the\r\nworld. The welcome transformation that has come\r\nabout since 11 September is the sudden emergence of\r\nan international solidarity to meet an international\r\nthreat. The United States, far and away the most\r\npowerful State in the international community,\r\nnevertheless believes that it needs and must have the\r\nassistance of a coalition of States in order to\r\nsuccessfully mount an offensive against the terrorists\r\nwho attacked it.\r\nIf the United States needs this, how much more\r\ndo others, infinitely more weak and vulnerable, need\r\nthe same solidarity? Without it, countries that have\r\nbeen preyed upon by a global network of terrorism\r\nsimply cannot cope with the challenge alone.\r\nWe therefore hope that the solidarity which has\r\nbeen manifest over the last two weeks will continue\r\nand that it will not be confined to a hunt for an\r\nindividual or a group, or to dealing with the symptoms\r\nalone; we must destroy terrorism as a system.\r\nTerrorism is an organic whole; it would be dangerous\r\nto try to cut one of the cells out, and to then tell\r\nourselves that we had killed it off. It is an evil that\r\nmetastasizes. Terrorism must be destroyed root and\r\nbranch. It is the anathema of the new century.\r\nWe know that there can be a concern that a war\r\nagainst terrorism might turn into a witch-hunt. Some\r\nargue that a distinction must be drawn between\r\nfreedom fighters and terrorists. To this, we would say,\r\nas the Secretary-General reminded us on Monday, that\r\nthe laws of civilized behaviour should apply to all.\r\nNormatively, international humanitarian law does not\r\npermit methods or means that can only be described as\r\nterrorism in the pursuit of any cause.\r\nThe great leap forward in international law over\r\nthe last few years has been the emergence of the norm\r\nthat there can be no impunity for crimes that constitute\r\na grave violation of human rights. When political\r\noffice, and bureaucratic or diplomatic immunity, have\r\nnot protected some who have committed grave\r\nviolations and have now been brought to justice, it\r\ncannot be admissible to argue that freedom fighters or\r\nany other group would be the only individuals who\r\nwould be above the law. Terrorism is defined by the\r\nact, not by a description of the perpetrator.\r\nSecondly, while the cynical view might be that\r\nthe end justifies the means, in all worthwhile political\r\nenterprises, the means are as important as the ends.\r\nEighty years ago, as India’s freedom struggle was\r\nmoving into a decisive phase, police fired on a group\r\nof protesters in the village of Chauri Chaura. The\r\ndemonstrators ran amok and burnt down the police\r\nstation, with 22 policemen in it. Mahatma Gandhi\r\ndeclared that the freedom movement had disgraced\r\nitself, and suspended it.\r\nWhat sort of freedom would it be that may be\r\nclaimed by massacring 6,000 innocent people on 11\r\nSeptember? The same day, thousands of miles away in\r\nIndia, terrorists walked into a temple, seized the two\r\npriests and beheaded them before the congregation.\r\nThose terrorists came from the same stable as those\r\nwho slit the throats of passengers on 11 September,\r\nwho killed Indian passengers in the same brutal fashion\r\ntwo years ago, and who attacked the Legislative\r\nAssembly in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday. They\r\nwere trained in the same camps and were financed and\r\nbacked by the same people. In facing them, as many\r\nhave reminded us, there can be no moral relativism.\r\nThe Secretary-General emphasized the imperative of\r\nmoral clarity. One can either be for civilization or for\r\nterrorism; there is no middle ground.\r\nWe hope that the shock of what happened on 11\r\nSeptember will force many Governments to rethink\r\npositions to which they have been wedded for far too\r\nlong. Some of them, which are liberal, open societies,\r\nbut which have not so far been the target of terrorists,\r\nhave argued that only States violate human rights;\r\nterrorism, they think, is only a crime, and they have\r\nbeen reluctant to join in either a condemnation of, or\r\naction against, terrorism as a violation of human rights.\r\nSpeaking to the Commission on Human Rights on\r\n25 September, the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights reminded its members that the victims of the\r\nattacks of 11 September have lost the foremost right,\r\nthe right to life. We could not agree more. Terrorists\r\nviolate human rights in the most egregious ways, and,\r\nas the High Commissioner told the Commission, the\r\nacts of terrorism that took place on 11 September\r\nshould be considered a crime against humanity.\r\nBut there is an even more insidious way in which\r\nterrorists undermine human rights. As the events of 11\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nSeptember showed, terrorists are driven not so much by\r\nblind rage as by a clear-eyed hatred of the values that\r\nopen, liberal, secular societies represent. There is an\r\ninevitable progression in plural, democratic societies to\r\never-greater freedoms for their citizens, balanced by\r\ncivic responsibilities freely undertaken. The citizens of\r\nthe freest societies in the world enjoy freedoms now\r\nthat their parents did not have.\r\nIt is this progress towards ever-greater freedom\r\nthat represents the greatest threat to those who believe\r\nin violent, repressive creeds. Multi-ethnic,\r\nmultireligious, open and tolerant societies are naturally\r\nodious to them; it is these values that they want to\r\ndestroy most of all, even more than symbols like the\r\nWorld Trade Center, or a Legislative Assembly. For\r\nthem, terrorism is a double-barrelled weapon. After the\r\ndevastation it wreaks, it takes an even greater and more\r\ninsidious toll. Open, democratic societies, by their very\r\nnature both the targets of and vulnerable to terrorism,\r\nmust necessarily take steps to defend their citizens.\r\nInstead of moving towards greater civil liberties, they\r\nhave to constrict some in the interests of security.\r\nIn the most unfortunate situations, the State\r\napparatus, unable to cope with the security challenge\r\nposed by terrorism, is forced to take draconian\r\nmeasures to counter it, with an inevitable impact on\r\ncivic and human rights. The anguished debate over this\r\nthat we see taking place in the United States is one that\r\nmany other democracies wracked by terrorism have\r\ngone through many times over. Terrorism wants to\r\nforce a diminution of openness, tolerance, rights and\r\nfreedom. This is why it is, and must be seen as, a\r\nprincipal threat to human rights.\r\nWe hope that the international solidarity forged in\r\nthe crucible of the recent disaster will be permanent,\r\nbut it would be prudent to work on the assumption that,\r\nas memory fades, so too might the willingness to stay\r\ntogether to fight a common evil. Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), the far-reaching resolution that\r\nthe Security Council has just adopted, should provide a\r\nframework for collective and individual action, laying\r\ndown a permanent obligation on all Members. We see\r\nit as analogous to the special powers that democratic\r\nGovernments enact to counter terrorism. We hope that\r\nit will be followed up and effectively implemented.\r\nThe attack on the Legislative Assembly, which\r\ntook place two days after resolution 1373 (2001) was\r\nadopted and is a deliberate challenge to it, will be the\r\nfirst test of the willingness of States to abide by the\r\nresponsibilities that the Council has now made\r\nmandatory and of the resolve of the Council and the\r\ninternational community to back up their words with\r\ndeeds, because paragraph 2 (d) of resolution 1373\r\n(2001) demands that States\r\n“prevent those who finance, plan, facilitate or\r\ncommit terrorist acts from using their respective\r\nterritories for those purposes against other States\r\nor their citizens”.\r\nThe General Assembly must do at least as much.\r\nIt does not have the power to compel compliance, but it\r\nspeaks with the voice and the moral authority of the\r\nentire international community. The General Assembly\r\ncannot, and perhaps should not, try to match the\r\nresolution of the Council, but it can, and we hope it\r\nwill, decide to throw its whole weight behind measures\r\nto develop a framework of international law within\r\nwhich international action can be taken against\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe capstone on this structure of conventions\r\nagainst terrorism is the comprehensive convention now\r\nunder negotiation. The question has sometimes been\r\nasked as to why, when we already have 12 international\r\nconventions against terrorism, we need a\r\ncomprehensive convention. The answer was given,\r\nsadly and monstrously, on 11 September. Planes were\r\nhijacked, but the cluster of conventions on hijacking\r\nprovides for action only against the hijackers; on 11\r\nSeptember, they killed themselves with their victims.\r\nPassengers were taken hostage, but the cluster of\r\nconventions against hostage-taking also provides for\r\naction only against the hostage-takers; on 11\r\nSeptember, they killed themselves with their victims.\r\nPlanes were used as massive bombs to destroy the\r\nWorld Trade Center and damage the Pentagon, but the\r\nconventions on terrorist bombings have precise\r\ndefinitions of what constitutes an explosive; no one\r\nthought that a plane would ever be used as an\r\nexplosive.\r\nTherefore, as experts on international law now\r\nrealize and our citizens will find hard to believe, under\r\nthe framework of the existing conventions on terrorism\r\nthe international community could not take action\r\nagainst those who recruited, trained, ordered,\r\nsupported, instigated or harboured the terrorists who\r\ncommitted the most horrendous act of terrorism the\r\nworld has ever seen.\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nThe Working Group of the Sixth Committee goes\r\ninto session in a fortnight’s time. There are a few issues\r\nleft to resolve. As the Secretary-General reminded us,\r\nsome of these have been contentious in the past, when\r\nwe might have permitted ourselves the luxury of\r\ntheoretical debate. It would be the best memorial to\r\nthose who died on 11 September and the clearest\r\npledge that we will work to ensure that an atrocity like\r\nthat never recurs if, at this session, the General\r\nAssembly were to come to an agreement by consensus\r\non a comprehensive convention to outlaw international\r\nterrorism.\r\nMr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation was deeply shocked by and\r\nstrongly condemns the 11 September terrorist attacks in\r\nNew York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. The\r\nitem on measures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nhas been deliberated by the General Assembly for quite\r\nsome years, but this year it has become more special\r\nand urgent than ever before.\r\nTerrorism, which endangers innocent lives,\r\ndepletes social wealth and jeopardizes state security,\r\nconstitutes a serious challenge to human civilization\r\nand dignity and poses a real threat to international\r\npeace and security. The international community must\r\ntherefore pool its wisdom and strengthen international\r\ncooperation against terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations, which is the principal forum\r\nin which States can cooperate with each other in\r\ncombating terrorism, should play a leading role in the\r\ninternational effort to that end. The main organs and\r\nother relevant agencies of the United Nations should\r\nstep up their coordination and cooperation in\r\npreventing and combating international terrorism. The\r\nSecurity Council should play its due role and establish\r\nan international anti-terrorism mechanism.\r\nSince the General Assembly’s adoption in 1994\r\nof the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate\r\nInternational Terrorism, commendable progress has\r\nbeen made in strengthening measures to combat\r\ninternational terrorism, as represented by the adoption\r\nof the International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings and the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, as\r\nwell as the ongoing formulation of an international\r\nconvention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism and a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism. States should be encouraged to\r\nbecome parties to the existing international anti-\r\nterrorism conventions as soon as possible and to\r\nimplement them faithfully. More positive and\r\nconstructive efforts should be made to finalize the\r\naforementioned two draft anti-terrorism conventions\r\nthat are still under negotiation.\r\nStates should take the necessary measures, in\r\naccordance with their national laws and international\r\nobligations, to cut off any financial, material, military\r\nand other forms of support for terrorists, resolutely\r\nbring the perpetrators of terrorist acts to justice and\r\nrefrain from supporting or tolerating them for any\r\nreason or in any manner. Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001 should be faithfully\r\nimplemented.\r\nThe fight against international terrorism, which\r\nwill be a protracted and complicated task, should be\r\nguided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and other well-established norms of\r\ninternational law. An integrated approach involving\r\npolitical, diplomatic, economic, legal and other means\r\nshould be adopted in this regard.\r\nWe are strongly opposed to linking terrorism to\r\nany specific religion or ethnicity. In order to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism, efforts must be made to address\r\nits symptoms and underlying causes alike. In the\r\ninternational fight against terrorism, the diversity of\r\ncivilizations should be respected and the issue of\r\ndevelopment addressed vigorously so as to enable\r\npeople at all levels in all countries to benefit from\r\nglobalization. The international community should\r\nstrengthen its efforts to solve regional conflicts in a\r\nmore positive manner and seek just and reasonable\r\nsolutions on the basis of the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Government of China firmly opposes and\r\ncondemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nIt is China’s basic policy to prevent and combat all\r\nterrorist activities. China is a party to nine out of the 12\r\ninternational conventions against terrorism and active\r\npreparations are under way for it to join the two most\r\nrecently adopted: the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism.\r\nThe Chinese Government has dedicated itself to\r\nthe promotion of regional and bilateral cooperation\r\nagainst terrorism, and has, within the framework of the\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.16\r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization, concluded, with\r\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and\r\nUzbekistan, the Shanghai Convention on Combating\r\nTerrorism, Separatism and Extremism.\r\nThe Chinese Government is determined to fight\r\nresolutely, together with all other States, against\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nProgramme and organization of work\r\nThe President: I wish to draw the attention of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to document A/INF/56/3, which\r\ncontains a partial programme of work and schedule of\r\nplenary meetings and which has been distributed in the\r\nHall. This schedule was prepared to facilitate the\r\norganization of the work of delegations and to help\r\nensure that the relevant documentation is ready for the\r\ndiscussion on the respective items.\r\nMembers will notice that agenda item 11, “Report\r\nof the Security Council”, originally announced for\r\nThursday morning, 4 October 2001, has been scheduled\r\nfor Monday, 15 October 2001 instead. Members will\r\nalso notice that, as a result of consultations, it was\r\nagreed that the general debate be scheduled for a\r\nseven-day period, from Saturday, 10 November,\r\nthrough Friday, 16 November 2001, which means that\r\nit will include one Sunday, 11 November. Since the\r\nAssembly will devote seven days instead of 10 days to\r\nthe general debate, the morning meetings during the\r\ngeneral debate will be from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and the\r\nafternoon meetings will be from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.\r\nFurthermore, since this will result in 48 hours for\r\nstatements in the general debate, instead of 60 hours, I\r\nurge speakers to limit their statements in the general\r\ndebate to 15 minutes, so that all the speakers can be\r\naccommodated within these seven days. I honestly ask\r\nfor your cooperation in this regard so that we can hold\r\nthe general debate as scheduled.\r\nI will in due course announce the dates for the\r\nconsideration of other agenda items, as well as keep the\r\nAssembly informed of any additions or changes. This\r\ninformation will also be indicated in addenda to\r\ndocument A/INF/56/3. The lists of speakers for items\r\ncited in document A/INF/56/3 are now open.\r\nIn addition, I would like to announce the\r\nfollowing activities. The 2001 United Nations Pledging\r\nConference for Development Activities will be held on\r\nthe morning of Wednesday and Thursday, 7 and 8\r\nNovember. The announcement of voluntary\r\ncontributions to the 2001 programmes of the United\r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\r\nRefugees in the Near East will take place on Thursday,\r\n4 December, in the morning. Members are requested to\r\nconsult the Journal for the announcements on these\r\nactivities for further details.\r\nFor more detailed information on the general\r\ndebate, I now give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Perfiliev (Director, General Assembly and\r\nEconomic and Social Council Affairs Division): We\r\nwould like to inform Member States that the list of\r\nspeakers for the general debate will be prepared in\r\naccordance with provisional list, number 3, that was\r\nmade available to all members on 29 August 2001. The\r\nsequence of speakers on the list will be maintained as\r\nmuch as possible, but the list will be condensed to cope\r\nwith the new time frame of the debate, which allows 14\r\nmeetings instead of previously planned 20 meetings.\r\nNow we have 14 meetings instead of 20, and seven\r\ndays instead of 10 days of debate.\r\nHowever, those Member States that had indicated\r\npreviously to the Secretariat that their heads of State\r\nand Government would be coming to the general\r\ndebate should reconfirm the level of their\r\nrepresentation for the general debate to the General\r\nAssembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs\r\nDivision by Monday, 8 October 2001, at 5 p.m. Our fax\r\nnumber is 963-4230.\r\nWe will also be happy to be informed as soon as\r\npossible if other Member States will participate at the\r\nhead of State or head of Government level, so as to\r\naccommodate them in the best way possible. This\r\nwould enable the Secretariat to prepare a new\r\nprovisional list of speakers, number 4, for the general\r\ndebate during that week and make it available to\r\nmembers by the end of next week. This announcement\r\nwill be distributed in the Hall during this meeting or in\r\nthe afternoon today.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
