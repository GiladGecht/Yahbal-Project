(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 166 (continued)\r\nMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/160 and\r\nCorr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines): As this is the first time that I have had the\r\nhonour to stand here and address this body, please\r\npermit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Likewise, allow me to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his re-election\r\nto a second term. His proven wisdom and compassion\r\nare needed more than ever to lead this Organization at\r\nthis time of world crisis.\r\nI stand before the Assembly today delivering a\r\nspeech at a time so sad, and on a topic stirring so much\r\nanger and disbelief, that mere words cannot begin to\r\nencompass the scope of these emotions.\r\nLet me express the sincere sympathy and\r\ncondolences of my Government and the people of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines to the victims of the\r\ntragedy that struck this city 22 days ago, and to their\r\nfamilies and friends. We share their grief and their\r\npain. Andre Cox, a 29-year-old man from Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines, had recently graduated from\r\ncollege and joined the staff of a company located on\r\nthe 101st floor of One World Trade Center. He is\r\namong the thousands missing due to that dastardly\r\nterrorist attack. On a more personal note, my elder\r\nsister, Patricia, was, at the time of the attack on the 45th\r\nfloor of Two World Trade Center. By the grace of God,\r\nshe escaped the tower physically unharmed but\r\nmentally traumatized. For close to 24 hours, I did not\r\nknow whether my sister was alive or dead. It seems to\r\nme pointless, even selfish, to be thankful for my good\r\nfortune at a time when good fortune is the exception\r\nrather than the norm. That is the nature of this beast.\r\nThis morning, I visited ground zero, courtesy of\r\nthe city of New York. The television cameras do not\r\nadequately capture the devastation. Amid the rubble\r\nare real flesh-and-blood human beings whose lives\r\nwere cruelly cut short by unspeakable barbarism. It is\r\nironic that as we become more civilized, we become\r\nmore vulnerable to terrorism. As civilized peoples, we\r\nare now faced with a common enemy, one that operates\r\nclandestinely but with great sophistication. As Mayor\r\nGiuliani said on this same podium two days ago, “We\r\nmust choose civilization or terror”. I believe that every\r\nnation must come together now to combat terrorism in\r\norder to safeguard security for humanity and the\r\nfundamental values of a democratic society. The mass\r\nmurder and economic peril in New York and\r\nWashington were unprecedented. Consequently,\r\nunprecedented responses will be required to avert a\r\nrecurrence. In our collective efforts to fight terrorism,\r\nwe will no doubt be focused, deliberate and measured.\r\nI am confident that, in this way, we will put into\r\nmotion appropriate mechanisms that will guarantee\r\nvictory over tyranny without compromising our way of\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nlife. But our vigilance must not wane. We must be\r\nrelentless in our efforts. Terrorism must have no future\r\nin our civilization.\r\nAt the same time, we must be aware of the\r\ndangers of racial profiling. The hate crimes that have\r\ntaken place in the aftermath of this tragedy against\r\nAmerican citizens of Middle Eastern descent are\r\nabhorrent and must not be tolerated. We must also\r\nmake it abundantly clear that this is not a battle against\r\nIslam, a peaceful faith, but against those who twist its\r\nteachings in a futile attempt to justify their heinous\r\ncrimes. The perpetrators of this cowardly act do not\r\nrepresent Islam.\r\nThe world as we know it changed on the eleventh\r\nday of September 2001. The impact of the actions of\r\nthe terrorists is being felt around the globe, and small\r\nStates such as mine will suffer along with the rest of\r\nthe world. I have been impressed — very impressed —\r\nby the statesmanship, resolve and restraint of the\r\nPresident of the United States and other world leaders.\r\nBut we understand that action must be taken. Let such\r\naction, however, be designed to bring the guilty ones to\r\njustice or have justice brought to them, and avoid, as\r\nfar as possible, the spillage of more innocent blood. I\r\nam satisfied that this is the focus of all peace-loving\r\nnations the world over.\r\nTerrorism is not parochial. The events of 11\r\nSeptember show us that it has spread its ugly tentacles\r\nbeyond borders in various forms and manifestations.\r\nWhile we embark on the task of meting out justice to\r\nthe perpetrators of these despicable acts of terrorism,\r\nwe must guard against unilateral action, lest we inflict\r\nterror on the innocent. However, we must similarly\r\nsearch for and address all the factors attributable to\r\nterrorism and its collateral consequences. I say this\r\nwithout in any way seeking to find a justification for\r\nthose acts. Such acts of mass murder can never be\r\njustified. This Assembly is uniquely suited to provide\r\nthe requisite collective leadership in this endeavour. If\r\nsome small good has come out of the despicable events\r\nof 11 September, it is that nations of the world have\r\nunited as one to condemn the acts. Moreover, the\r\nchoice is clear: ennoble civilization or descend into\r\nbarbarism. I am sure that barbarism and its acolytes\r\nwill be defeated.\r\nFalling into line with the international effort to\r\nfight terrorism, my Government has already taken steps\r\nto tighten security and implement measures to close the\r\nloopholes that criminals and terrorists would seek to\r\nexploit for their nefarious deeds. In this regard, my\r\nGovernment is working closely with other Caribbean\r\nnations and traditional allies in the North Atlantic.\r\nMy very presence and that of my wife in New\r\nYork indicate that the political leadership in Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean will not\r\nbe intimidated by terrorists and will not deter us from\r\ntravel. President Bush has reminded us that the skies\r\nare safe. Mayor Giuliani has appealed to everyone to\r\nreturn to their normal duties and has asked tourists to\r\ncontinue visiting New York. If my wife and I are safe\r\nto travel to New York from beautiful Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines, so, too, is it for visitors, tourists,\r\ninvestors and friends from the United States of\r\nAmerica, Canada, Europe, Central America, South\r\nAmerica and the world over to travel to Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines and the Caribbean. Anyone who\r\nfears travelling has unwittingly succumbed to the evil\r\nof terrorism.\r\nFinally, let me assure the people of the United\r\nStates, and particularly those of New York City, that\r\nthe Government and the people of Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines love you dearly. You have provided a\r\nhome for thousands and thousands of our people. You\r\nhave an unconquerable spirit — your wounds will heal\r\nfast. We will be there with you as you heal. May God\r\nbless you all.\r\nMr. Galuška (Czech Republic): Allow me at the\r\noutset to express heartfelt sympathy on behalf of the\r\nCzech Government and the Czech nation to those who\r\nlost their loved ones in the terrorist attack on 11\r\nSeptember 2001 and to all the American people. We\r\nare deeply moved by this unspeakable tragedy and\r\nshare their grief. We express our full solidarity with the\r\nGovernment of the United States in its resolve to\r\npunish the perpetrators and sponsors of this appalling\r\nact and to fight international terrorism.\r\nTerrorism has traditionally been a topic in the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly since 1972. Since\r\nthen, the United Nations has adopted a great many\r\nresolutions on this topic and significantly contributed\r\nmainly to the creation of a solid legal system consisting\r\nup until now of 12 universal criminal conventions\r\naimed at suppressing various forms of terrorism. This\r\nshows that the United Nations has never\r\nunderestimated the threat of terrorism. Nevertheless,\r\nthis item on the General Assembly’s agenda has never\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nappeared to be as urgent and alarming as it is now.\r\nNobody ever foresaw that the scourge of terrorism,\r\nhowever seriously it had been perceived, would\r\nsomeday reach the level of a global and systematic\r\nthreat to international security comparable to that of\r\narmed conflict.\r\nIn the wake of the tragic events of 11 September,\r\nthe international community’s evaluation of the threat\r\nof terrorism changed once and for all. If not before,\r\nthen no doubt on that day international terrorism\r\nbecame a threat to world peace, and it is therefore\r\nnecessary to fight it accordingly. The United Nations,\r\nas the only universal international Organization, is\r\ndestined to play a primary role in this fight, and I am\r\nglad to say that the first actions taken by our\r\nOrganization after 11 September proved its capability\r\nand readiness to live up to these expectations. Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1368 (2001), as well as General\r\nAssembly resolution 56/1, put the terrorist attack of 11\r\nSeptember into the above-mentioned context and\r\nprepared the ground for Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) of 28 September, which tackles terrorism\r\nin an unprecedented manner, within the framework of\r\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter. This\r\nhistoric step promotes to a new level the legal system\r\nfor suppressing terrorism, which no longer challenges\r\nonly States parties to the relevant conventions, but the\r\nwhole international community.\r\nDespite all these recent efforts, we must continue\r\nfurther in strengthening political and legal instruments\r\nin this field. The need to adhere to and implement\r\nexisting legal instruments was eloquently stressed in\r\nthe statement of the European Union, delivered in this\r\nforum on Monday, 1 October, with which the Czech\r\nRepublic, as a country associated with the European\r\nUnion, aligned itself. In this connection, I am proud to\r\nsay that the Czech Republic has been participating\r\nsignificantly in building up this multilateral legal\r\nsystem. The Czech Republic is a State party to 9 of the\r\n12 sectoral anti-terrorist conventions, including the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings, one of the most recent ones, and is\r\na signatory State to the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which\r\nwas signed by President Havel during last year’s\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nNow our legislative bodies are making every\r\neffort to adopt the measures necessary in our domestic\r\nlegislature to implement obligations arising from this\r\nConvention, as well as the relevant provisions on the\r\nfinancing of terrorism contained in Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) and the European Union action\r\nplan on terrorism.\r\nAs far as the current and future negotiations on\r\nnew anti-terrorist instruments are concerned, the Czech\r\nrepresentatives are ready to do their best to help move\r\nforward a comprehensive convention on terrorism this\r\nfall. The contribution of the general convention may be\r\nenormous if it succeeds in laying down a general\r\ndefinition of terrorism, which represents a missing\r\nelement for the international political and legal\r\nframework in this field.\r\nNevertheless, let me emphasize that the Czech\r\nRepublic does not focus only on multilateral\r\nconventions. In order for the work of the Ministry of\r\nthe Interior and police organs with respect to\r\nsuppressing terrorism to be effective the Czech\r\nRepublic is required to enter into bilateral cooperation\r\nwith a great many countries and the International\r\nCriminal Police Organization (Interpol). For this\r\npurpose, the Czech Republic has so far concluded 15\r\nbilateral international agreements on cooperation in\r\nfighting organized crime and terrorism, and 15 others\r\nare in different stages of preparatory work. In addition,\r\nas a country heading for membership in the European\r\nUnion, the Czech Republic intends to cooperate with\r\nthe European Police Office (Europol), pending\r\napproval of the agreement on cooperation.\r\nAllow me to raise one concrete proposal on how\r\nto contribute to the above-mentioned strengthening of\r\nthe international system for suppressing terrorism. As\r\nthe Assembly may recall, the Secretary-General invited\r\nthe heads of State and Government attending the\r\nMillennium Summit last year to make use of that\r\nunique occasion to reaffirm their commitment to the\r\ninternational rule of law by signing and ratifying some\r\nof the international conventions deposited with the\r\nSecretary-General. This invitation resulted in 274\r\nactions on treaties during the three days of the Summit.\r\nA similar treaty event was supposed to be organized on\r\nthe occasion of the special session on children, which\r\nhad to be postponed because of the tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember.\r\nIn the light of last year’s success, I should like to\r\npropose that a treaty ceremony of this kind be\r\norganized now for the sectoral anti-terrorist\r\nconventions deposited with the Secretary-General.\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nSuch an event could be held at an appropriate time\r\nduring the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly,\r\nand I firmly believe that numerous signatures and\r\nratifications of the conventions would contribute to\r\ntheir universal acceptance.\r\nThis statement and the above-mentioned steps\r\nundertaken by the Czech Republic reflect my country’s\r\ndesire and determination to play its part in concerted\r\ninternational efforts to eradicate international\r\nterrorism. In this connection, I call on all Member\r\nStates to maintain the sense of solidarity and\r\ncooperation that united us after 11 September and to\r\nstep up our efforts to liberate the world from the\r\nscourge of terrorism.\r\nMr. Fall (Guinea) (spoke in French): The tragic\r\nevents that took place in the United States of America\r\nhave stricken the conscience of all peace- and freedom-\r\nloving nations.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea would like to take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate its compassion to the people\r\nand the Government of the United States of America\r\nand to the families of the victims.\r\nThe unanimous stand taken by the international\r\ncommunity following the events of 11 September 2001\r\nshow the will of States to collectively and effectively\r\ncombat terrorism. Today the establishment of a\r\nconcerted and coordinated strategy seems the\r\nappropriate framework to defend together the universal\r\nvalues of civilization.\r\nTerrorism, one of the most dangerous scourges of\r\nour time, is the very antithesis of the values of our\r\nOrganization. It violates fundamental principles of\r\nhumanism and democracy and impedes the economic\r\nand social development of countries.\r\nFor several years now the question of terrorism\r\nhas been on our Organization’s agenda. Many\r\nresolutions, decisions and recommendations have been\r\nadopted to prevent it and to eliminate it in all its forms\r\nand manifestations. Due to a lack of consensus, the\r\ndebate has often been bogged down because of\r\ndiffering and inflexible positions. These political\r\nquarrels, however, should not serve to cover up the root\r\nof an evil that affects all nations today. The tragic\r\nevents of 11 September have clearly shed light for all\r\non the serious risks posed by terrorism.\r\nThrough these acts, which have plunged more\r\nthan 80 countries into mourning and have dealt a\r\nsevere blow to the world economy, which was already\r\nextremely weakened, the entire international\r\ncommunity now feels more threatened than ever.\r\nUndoubtedly that is why the General Assembly has\r\ndecided to debate the question of terrorism in plenary\r\nmeetings.\r\nAllow me to reiterate my delegation’s full support\r\nfor Security Council resolution 1368 (2001) and\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1, which attest to our\r\ncollective indignation and our shared determination to\r\neliminate the scourge down to its deepest roots.\r\nFor the Republic of Guinea, the phenomenon of\r\nterrorism cannot be used as a means of political\r\npressure. To the contrary, it is a deliberate crime that,\r\nbecause of its cowardice and the scope of its impact,\r\nmust be fought and eliminated. This is why my country\r\nis resolutely on the side of those nations determined to\r\nconfront international terrorism.\r\nMy Government considers that support for\r\ninternational terrorism is a flagrant violation of the\r\nprinciples of international law and a serious threat to\r\npeace and security. In that context, it unreservedly\r\nsupports resolution 1373 (2001), adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council on 28 September.\r\nClearly, the elimination of terrorism requires the\r\nfirm determination of States to fight together against\r\nthe activities that fuel it, such as the financing of\r\nterrorist acts, the recruitment on their territory of\r\nmembers of terrorist groups, the supply of weapons and\r\npolitical support. The magnitude and the complexity of\r\nthe phenomenon call for the close cooperation of all\r\nStates to fully eliminate it. The perpetrators and\r\nsponsors of terrorist acts must not find safe haven in\r\nany country. My delegation is convinced that these\r\nindividuals must be brought to justice in accordance\r\nwith the rules and procedures of international law.\r\nBecause of the numerous ramifications of\r\nterrorism, the international community will have to\r\nwork carefully to identify those countries that are\r\nserving as bases for terrorist networks. My delegation\r\nsupports the convening of a high-level conference\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations to draw up a\r\nresponse of the international community to the\r\nchallenge of terrorism. My delegation welcomes the\r\nresults achieved by the Ad Hoc Committee on\r\nterrorism and by the Working Group on measures to\r\neliminate international terrorism. In this regard, we are\r\nresolutely in favour of the rapid adoption of a\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism and the\r\neffective implementation of existing international legal\r\ninstruments that deal with the war on terrorism.\r\nIn deciding, by resolution 53/22, to make 2001\r\nthe United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, the General Assembly has urged us to\r\nshow more tolerance and acceptance of difference in a\r\ncommunity of interests. In that spirit, an appeal must\r\nbe made to all countries for the organization of a vast\r\ncampaign of education and raising the awareness of\r\npopulations to warn them of and to avert the danger of\r\nterrorism. Extremism and intolerance, which are the\r\nbasis for new forms of terrorism, must be banished\r\nfrom international practice.\r\nMy delegation hopes that at the end of this\r\ndebate, a broad consensus will emerge that will allow\r\nus, together, to take the necessary measures to combat\r\nand eliminate this new scourge, which is threatening\r\nthe values of universal civilization.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I would\r\nlike to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\r\nelection and wish you great success.\r\nSpain fully endorses the intervention of the\r\nrepresentative of Belgium on behalf of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nThe terrible, cowardly and inhumane terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September have shocked the whole world.\r\nThey have truly horrified the Spanish people, on whose\r\nbehalf I renew our heartfelt support to the Government\r\nand the people of the United States, as well as to the\r\npeople of New York, which is our home.\r\nSpain has experienced the consequences of\r\nterrorism for a long time and knows very well the kind\r\nof suffering that it can inflict. Terrorism tries to\r\noverwhelm us with a dictatorship of terror and to\r\nparalyse us with fear. But against terror and fear,\r\nhumanity has justice and solidarity, two noble qualities\r\nof humankind.\r\nThe deaths of thousands of innocent people\r\nshould not be in vain. The world cannot remain passive\r\nin the face of these atrocities, which attack the most\r\nfundamental norms of civilized behaviour. We must\r\naim at terrorist networks and at those who aid them or\r\ngive them shelter, and all necessary actions must be\r\ndirected at them. These measures will vary in nature\r\nand will take time.\r\nAbove all, such measures require joint action by\r\nthe international community, for which the broadest\r\npossible coalition will be necessary. States cannot carry\r\nout this task in isolation. Whereas terrorism takes\r\nadvantage of the ease of communication and freedom\r\nof movement among countries, to date we have failed\r\nto abolish the frontiers and the political and\r\nbureaucratic obstacles to international cooperation.\r\nTerrorism is a threat to us all, and we must defeat it\r\nthrough the cooperation of all. This coalition must\r\ninclude every government of the world that is\r\ngenuinely interested in combating this scourge.\r\nThe fight against terrorism has nothing to do with\r\nan alleged clash of civilizations. To identify terrorism\r\nwith a particular culture or religion would not only be a\r\ngreat injustice, but also a gross mistake; we would in\r\nfact be playing right into the hands of the terrorists.\r\nCombating terrorism has to do with defending the\r\nvalues that are shared by all the great civilizations on\r\nthis planet. They are those values embodied in the\r\nCharter.\r\nA global response is required by the international\r\ncommunity against the phenomenon of terrorism. The\r\nnatural place to establish such an international coalition\r\nis the United Nations. Here we can all work together.\r\nThe immediate reaction of the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council in the hours and days that\r\nfollowed the terrorist attacks, the adoption of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and the convening of\r\nthis debate all show the Organization’s determination\r\nto put its legitimacy at the service of effective\r\ninternational action. The Charter provides ample room\r\nto move for this purpose.\r\nOur response must be commensurate with the\r\nchallenge that terrorism represents. It should never\r\nimitate the contempt that terrorism displays for rules\r\nand rights. The existing instruments, with regard to\r\nboth internal law and international law, must be\r\ncomplemented and developed to meet the challenge.\r\nThe United Nations has an important task and\r\nmust rise to the occasion. This is a crucial moment for\r\nthe Organization as well as for all of us, representatives\r\nof its Member States. Whoever may think, as a matter\r\nof convenience or out of delusion, that this is a\r\nproblem that affects only a few countries is making a\r\ntremendous mistake. If we fail now, we will be letting\r\ndown all the victims of terrorism, and we will be\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\npaving the road for equally abominable acts in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe work of the United Nations has been made\r\nvisible in the first place in the Security Council, which\r\nimmediately adopted resolution 1368 (2001), regarding\r\nterrorism as a threat to international peace and security\r\nand recognizing the inherent right of self-defence in\r\naccordance with Article 51 of the Charter.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) gives\r\nlegal and political strength to a series of tools for\r\ninternational cooperation that were previously binding\r\nonly on the States parties to conventions against\r\nterrorism. Spain considers this resolution extremely\r\nimportant, because it is saying that the international\r\ncommunity will not limit itself to acting against the\r\nperpetrators of such horrible recent attacks, but will\r\nalso take steps to prevent such heinous acts in the\r\nfuture. We strongly support this resolution and are\r\nready to cooperate towards its full and proper\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe role of the General Assembly will be\r\nfundamental in this effort. The Assembly’s declarations\r\nof 1994 and 1996 on measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism paved the way. Resolution 56/1\r\nwas a sound response to the attacks on 11 September.\r\nWe must expedite signature, ratification and\r\nadhesion for the 12 conventions against terrorism that\r\nhave been adopted in the framework of the United\r\nNations. Spain has signed all 12 and has ratified 11. We\r\nwill shortly be able to communicate the ratification of\r\nthe one dealing with the suppression of the financing of\r\nterrorism. It is of the utmost importance to provide the\r\nexecutive and judicial institutions of our States with\r\nuniversally accepted and applied standards regarding\r\nterrorism. For that it is essential that those conventions\r\nthat are in force be as widely supported as possible and\r\nthat they be fully implemented.\r\nThe General Assembly must also request the\r\nSixth Committee to successfully finalize the\r\nnegotiations on the general convention against\r\nterrorism and the convention on nuclear terrorism.\r\nSpain is determined to work intensively in the\r\nAssembly in order to conclude those negotiations. We\r\nattach great importance to provisions rejecting any\r\njustification of terrorism on political or other grounds,\r\nand to the need to prevent the use of asylum as a cover\r\nfor terrorist activities.\r\nFurthermore, Spain believes that the convening of\r\na high-level international conference against terrorism\r\ncould contribute to strengthening international\r\ncommitment to fight terrorism, provided that it is\r\nproperly planned. In order to do that, it would be\r\nnecessary to reach consensus on the terms of such a\r\nmeeting prior to its holding.\r\nLikewise, regional cooperation must be\r\nstrengthened in this area. The European Union is\r\nalready taking steps in that direction, and the\r\nconclusions of the European Council meeting held on\r\n21 September are a good example. We trust that other\r\nregions of the world will also make similar progress.\r\nTerrorism is a serious threat to democracy and\r\nfreedom. It would be ominous to remain passive before\r\nsuch a threat. We must be able to place international\r\ncooperation against terrorism on a substantially\r\ndifferent plane. Basically, that means a change in\r\npolitical culture. We have moved from viewing\r\nterrorism as an undesirable phenomenon, but one\r\nwhich we did not know how to defeat, to deciding that\r\nwe are going to mobilize all our energies to eradicate it\r\nfrom our lives.\r\nI can assure the Assembly that my country shall\r\ncontinue to be at the forefront of this effort so that this\r\nsession of the General Assembly may be remembered\r\nas the one that gave birth to a coalition against\r\nterrorism, one of the greatest challenges facing the\r\nworld at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\r\nMs. Jarbussynova (Kazakhstan): The\r\nunbelievable acts of violence committed in the United\r\nStates on 11 September deeply shocked people all over\r\nthe world. Kazakhstan joined other countries in firmly\r\ncondemning those barbaric and criminal acts of\r\nterrorism, which took the lives of thousands of\r\ninnocent people and caused considerable material\r\ndamage. President Nursultan Nazarbaev conveyed deep\r\ncondolences to President George Bush and expressed\r\nprofound sympathy to the Government and people of\r\nthe United States of America.\r\nWhat happened in the United States was a crime\r\nagainst humanity, an act of horrendous violence against\r\nall nations and creeds. We are confident that the\r\ninternational efforts will help to find the authors and\r\nperpetrators of those inhuman terrorist attacks and\r\nbring them to justice for their crimes. It is essential that\r\nthe response should not only be effective, but also just.\r\nWe welcome the intention of the Government of the\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nUnited States to produce evidence before any military\r\nstrike.\r\nIn that respect, we should not condemn the people\r\nof Afghanistan for the terrorist attacks, as we must not\r\ncondemn Muslims and Arabs — the vast majority of\r\nwhom do not support religious extremism. As actions\r\nare taken against terrorists and their sponsors, we must\r\nmake sure that the lives of thousands of women and\r\ngirls in Afghanistan, who have suffered so terribly\r\nunder the rule of the Taliban, are saved and that their\r\nplight not be forgotten. Afghanistan’s women and girls\r\nshould be at the centre of the rebirth of the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan. They must finally gain their\r\nfreedom and full rights and get access to education and\r\nhealth care.\r\nAlarmed by the severe situation in Afghanistan,\r\nthe President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan\r\nNazarbaev, expressed during his address to the\r\nMillennium Summit last year his deep concern at the\r\ngrowing threat emanating from the conflict in\r\nAfghanistan to the stability and security of Central\r\nAsia. He called for a special meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil to adopt large-scale and comprehensive\r\nmeasures to settle the situation in Afghanistan. We\r\nbelieve that new approaches to the assessment of the\r\ncurrent political, military and geopolitical situation in\r\nthe region and the elaboration by the United Nations of\r\nan essentially new concept for a settlement in\r\nAfghanistan could help to bring long-awaited peace\r\nand stability to the suffering Afghan people.\r\nThe recent tragedy in the United States has\r\ndemonstrated how vulnerable we are to insidious and\r\nunexpected terrorist acts. The tragic events force the\r\ninternational community to reconsider its measures to\r\neliminate this extremely dangerous phenomenon. This\r\nissue should be addressed globally by strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation to combat terrorism in all its\r\nforms. Kazakhstan has always spoken out against\r\nterrorism and is ready to participate in the\r\nestablishment of an effective international coalition of\r\ncountries to combat international terrorism.\r\nIn the light of the recent events, Kazakhstan is\r\nreviewing international instruments on terrorism with a\r\nview to becoming party to them. We are in the process\r\nof ratifying the 1997 International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and the 1999\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism.\r\nThis November, the Government of Kazakhstan\r\nwill host a meeting of member States of the Conference\r\non Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in\r\nAsia, during which the heads of State and Government\r\nare expected to sign the Almaty act, the final document\r\nof that regional forum. The Almaty act unconditionally\r\nand unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations, as well as any support or\r\nacquiescence to it or the failure to condemn it directly.\r\nThat document also declares the determination of\r\nthe member States of the Conference on Interaction and\r\nConfidence-building Measures in Asia to cooperate on\r\na bilateral and multilateral basis to combat terrorism,\r\nincluding its possible sources. The participants in the\r\nprocess will unite their efforts not to allow terrorism in\r\nany form to be planned, assisted or financed from the\r\nterritory of any State, or to provide terrorists with safe\r\nhaven and protection. The confidence-building\r\nmeasures will contribute significantly to the efforts of\r\nthe international community to ensure global and\r\nregional security and play a significant role in\r\ncombating international terrorism.\r\nDuring the second half of the last century,\r\ninternational terrorism became a dangerous\r\nphenomenon threatening international peace and\r\nsecurity. Accordingly, countries found themselves\r\nobliged to develop legal instruments to combat it. The\r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization — comprised of\r\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the People’s Republic of\r\nChina, the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan — has\r\nadopted the Shanghai Convention on Combating\r\nTerrorism, Separatism and Extremism. The member\r\nStates have clearly indicated that opposing terrorism,\r\nextremism and separatism is one of the most important\r\nobjectives of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,\r\nand they are ready to take effective measures, in close\r\ncooperation with all States and international\r\norganizations, to wage an uncompromising struggle to\r\nroot out the global threat of terrorism. Measures are\r\nalso being taken to hasten the establishment of a\r\nregional anti-terrorist structure.\r\nAs I mentioned already, terrorism represents a\r\nmajor threat to international peace and security. It\r\nknows neither international nor moral boundaries. But\r\nthe international community should also expose the\r\nforces that create poverty, intolerance, hatred and\r\nenvironmental degradation, which lead to instability in\r\nthe world. These negative factors can fan the flames of\r\nhate and ignite the belief that terrorism is the only\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nsolution to a community’s or a nation’s ills. When\r\npeople are denied access to clean water, soil and air to\r\nmeet their basic human needs, we see the rise of\r\npoverty, ill health and a sense of hopelessness.\r\nDesperate people can resort to desperate solutions.\r\nThey may care little about themselves and the people\r\nthey hurt.\r\nThe rise of globalization and its impacts on global\r\ntrade patterns is also a key issue that the international\r\ncommunity must face up to. We cannot be for or\r\nagainst globalization. It is simply a fact of the modern\r\nworld, and we cannot ignore it. But we need a just and\r\nfair system that will bring sustainable economic\r\nbenefits to rich and poor countries alike. Without this,\r\nthe forces that forge civil unrest and that, in the\r\nextreme, can give rise to terrorism will continue to\r\nflourish everywhere.\r\nA great deal remains to be done by the\r\ninternational community to eliminate terrorism. This\r\nglobal problem could be resolved by intensifying the\r\nwork of the Security Council and increasing its efforts\r\nto prevent and combat this dangerous phenomenon.\r\nThat principal body of the United Nations, which is\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, should play a leading role in that\r\ndirection. It must respond with a greater commitment\r\nto take all appropriate action to formulate a global\r\nstrategy against terrorism.\r\nThis week’s plenary meetings are an important\r\nopportunity for the General Assembly to reaffirm its\r\nstrong commitment to combating international\r\nterrorism. My country attaches the utmost importance\r\nto the prevention and suppression of terrorism, and\r\ncontinues actively to participate in the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations in that field.\r\nMr. Ouch (Cambodia) (spoke in French): It has\r\nbeen barely three weeks since the terrible 11 September\r\nterrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the\r\nPentagon, in which more than 6,000 innocent\r\nAmericans and people from almost 80 other countries\r\nlost their lives, and in which more than 8,000 people\r\nwere wounded. Most of the world experienced the\r\nindescribable horror of seeing planeloads of innocent\r\nhuman beings crash into buildings filled with\r\nthousands of other innocent human beings. They\r\nexperienced the sheer terror of watching people jump\r\nfrom the upper floors of the collapsing World Trade\r\nCenter to avoid being burned alive inside.\r\nHaving suffered more than two decades of war\r\nand terrorist acts, the people and the Government of\r\nCambodia understand very well how deeply the people\r\nof the United States felt the disaster’s severity and\r\nagony for those they love in these tragic circumstances.\r\nTheir pain is ours. I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto reiterate once again the heartfelt condolences of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Cambodia to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States, and to\r\nthose of all other nations that lost citizens in these\r\nheinous terrorist acts.\r\nWe are gathered today to discuss terrorism in all\r\nits forms and manifestations with a view to\r\nstrengthening international cooperation to combat that\r\nscourge. Without meaning to diminish the anguish and\r\nsorrow of the families of the victims and of all others\r\naffected by the recent attacks, I ask members to reflect\r\nfor a moment on the hundreds of millions of victims of\r\nacts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations all\r\nover the world which has afflicted mankind throughout\r\nits history.\r\nTerrorism is defined as the sustained, clandestine\r\nuse of violence, murder, kidnapping and bombing to\r\nachieve a political purpose. It has prevailed throughout\r\nhistory: through the horrors and suffering of\r\ncolonialism, through the subversion of entire countries\r\nand peoples, and throughout the cold war. Terrorism\r\ncuts across national borders; although Governments are\r\noften the targets, it is more often innocent civilians\r\nwho are its victims. Public and private property too is\r\ndestroyed.\r\nThe difference today is that through ever more\r\npowerful globalization, enabled by advances in\r\ninformation and communications technology, nobody\r\nand no country in the world — with no distinction\r\nbetween the rich and the poor, the powerful and the\r\npowerless, between a super-Power and a little speck in\r\nthe ocean — is safe from terrorism. When death\r\nstrikes, we are all the same.\r\nBefore all else, that black Tuesday’s mass murder\r\nmust be condemned in the harshest possible terms\r\nwithout qualification or conditions. The demented,\r\nsuicidal fury of the attackers resulted in heinous acts of\r\nindiscriminate and wholesale murder that have changed\r\nthe world for the worse. A moral stand must begin with\r\nunequivocal condemnation, the absence of which could\r\neliminate even the language by which people can\r\ncommunicate.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nWe must analyse the causes of the tragedy; that is\r\nessential also if we are to find solutions to the all-\r\nencompassing horror of terrorism. No suicidal\r\n“terrorist gene” is known to exist or is ever likely to be\r\nfound. Therefore, surely the attackers and their\r\nsupporters, who were all presumably born normal,\r\nwere afflicted by something that caused their\r\nmetamorphosis from normal human beings, capable of\r\ngentleness and affection, into desperate and fiendish\r\nbeings with nothing but murder in their hearts and\r\nminds. What happened? We must all engage in\r\ncollective and honest soul-searching to find the answer.\r\nFor only through an understanding of the underlying\r\ncauses can we effectively fight terrorism.\r\nThis month, Cambodia is celebrating the tenth\r\nanniversary of the signing of the Paris peace\r\nagreements. I am pleased to say that we have come a\r\nlong way since that auspicious day. Following the\r\ncollapse of the Khmer Rouge in 1996 and the fair and\r\nfree elections of 1998, peace and stability prevail\r\nthroughout the country for the first time after many\r\ndecades of war and suffering. The Government and the\r\npeople of Cambodia are determined to rebuild the\r\ncountry in the mould of democracy, respect for human\r\nrights and economic and social development. Our war\r\nnow is a war against poverty. All this, however, has not\r\nentirely solved the problem of terrorism. In November\r\n2000, Cambodia was attacked by a terrorist group\r\ncalling itself the Cambodian Freedom Fighters, which\r\ncaused extensive harm to innocent civilians as well as\r\ndamage to public and private property. Its activities are\r\nterrorist acts and not anti-Government acts; they are\r\naimed at destabilizing peace and security in the country\r\nand overthrowing the legal Government elected by the\r\npeople of Cambodia. Today, Cambodia still continues\r\nto face terrorist threats from that group, which is\r\nmasterminded by Cambodians in exile, who live abroad\r\nin comfort and with total impunity.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to recall that\r\ndefinitions in the United States Intelligence\r\nSurveillance Act of 1978 and the United Kingdom\r\nPrevention of Terrorism Act of 1976 clearly underline\r\nthe use of violence to coerce or intimidate the civilian\r\npopulation in order to bring about changes in\r\nGovernment policy.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of\r\nCambodia, I should like to appeal to the countries\r\ninvolved, in a spirit of respect for the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council, of the General\r\nAssembly and of international law, to refrain from\r\nsupporting or tolerating the activities of the terrorist\r\ngroup known as the Cambodian Freedom Fighters,\r\nwhich is trying to commit terrorist acts against the\r\nCambodian people. Regardless of their motivations, the\r\nperpetrators must be condemned, prosecuted and\r\npunished.\r\nCambodia endured more than its share of\r\ncollective suffering during the cold-war period. We feel\r\nsolidarity with the people of Afghanistan. For decades\r\nthey, too, have suffered. Their schools, their hospitals,\r\ntheir houses, their infrastructure — everything has been\r\ndestroyed. They have been cut off from medicines and\r\nfrom health care, and now, following the events of 11\r\nSeptember, the United Nations is warning us of the\r\ndanger of a humanitarian catastrophe of unbelievable\r\nproportions. We must recall this when we speak of\r\neradicating terrorism. We are fully in favour of the\r\nelimination of terrorism throughout the world, and in\r\nparticular of the masterminds of the horrendous\r\nterrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the\r\nPentagon. But we must do so without inflicting more\r\nsuffering on, or sowing more death among, the people\r\nof Afghanistan.\r\nAllow me to associate myself with the other\r\nspeakers in emphasizing that the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember have not discouraged any of us. Quite the\r\ncontrary; they have further enhanced our strength and\r\nour solidarity and intensified our will to combat these\r\nterrorist acts against humanity. The Prime Minister of\r\nthe Royal Government of Cambodia, Mr. Hun Sen,\r\nexpressed his support for the military campaign waged\r\nby the United States of America against terrorists. He\r\nalso appealed for the safety of civilians to be\r\nsafeguarded.\r\nHe also recently declared that\r\n“The whole world must unite its efforts and\r\nundertake joint action to fight against terrorism.”\r\nIt is in that spirit that we fully support the efforts\r\nunder way under the auspices of the United Nations to\r\nforge a global coalition against terrorism, as we have\r\nbeen called upon to do by our Secretary-General, Kofi\r\nAnnan.\r\nThe Security Council, the day after the terrorist\r\nattacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,\r\nadopted resolution 1368 (2001), which vigorously\r\ncondemned those attacks. In addition, last Friday, a\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nresolution of considerable scope — resolution 1373\r\n(2001) — containing measures and strategies to combat\r\ninternational terrorism, was also adopted unanimously.\r\nThose resolutions supplement resolution 1269 (1999),\r\nwhich unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism.\r\nWe are here today to devise specific measures to\r\nback these resolutions. There are already 12\r\nconventions that deal with the various aspects of\r\nterrorism. The most recent one was adopted during the\r\nmost recent session of the General Assembly to combat\r\nthe financing of terrorism. There are also two\r\ninitiatives in the Sixth Committee and in the General\r\nAssembly: one proposed by India and the other by\r\nRussia. We fully support India’s initiative to\r\nconsolidate those 12 Conventions into one single\r\nconvention that would then be implemented by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Petrič (Slovenia): I deem it most\r\nappropriate, since we are deliberating on measures to\r\nprevent and eradicate terrorism, to again express\r\nSlovenia’s deepest sorrow and condolences to the\r\npeople of the United States of America, and in\r\nparticular to the city of New York, for the tragic and\r\nhorrific terrorist attack that occurred on 11 September.\r\nThis horrible crime has brought us together today, here\r\nin the General Assembly, to express our firm devotion\r\nand political will to eradicate terrorism, which three\r\nweeks ago struck New York but could, unless\r\nprevented in time, strike our capitals too. Indeed, we\r\nare morally bound to the thousands of victims of\r\nterrorism to put the fight against terrorism at the top of\r\nour agenda.\r\nSlovenia has aligned itself with the statement of\r\nthe representative of Belgium on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union and associated countries. We agree\r\nwith the conclusions and other planned activities of the\r\nEuropean Union as well as the plan of action that was\r\nadopted by the European Council at its extraordinary\r\nsession on 21 September.\r\nSlovenia strongly condemns all acts of terrorism,\r\nregardless of who the perpetrators are or what their\r\ndeclared aim may be. Terrorism is always — I repeat,\r\nalways — criminal and unjustifiable, because it\r\ndeliberately and indiscriminately attacks those who are\r\nmost vulnerable: the civilian population. There can be\r\nno justification whatsoever for such attacks.\r\nTerrorism abhors dialogue and has no respect for\r\nthe lives of others, not even for the lives of women and\r\nchildren. It thrives on fear and hatred, and preys on\r\nignorance and prejudice. While often Governments can\r\nbe the targets, in most cases civilians are the victims —\r\ncivilians of any country, creed or colour, as the crime\r\ncommitted on 11 September proves. Innocent citizens\r\nfrom more than 80 countries were injured or killed, and\r\nproperty — both private and public — was damaged or\r\ndestroyed.\r\nInternational terrorism has many manifestations\r\nand many sources. It is a threat to the international\r\ncommunity as a whole; no country in any part of the\r\nworld can feel free of the scourge of terrorist crimes.\r\nInternational terrorism has become a serious threat to\r\nGovernments, and especially to individuals. Terrorist\r\nattacks most often take place on an international scale,\r\nso international cooperation and coordinated efforts are\r\nessential elements in combating international terrorism.\r\nGlobal action to prevent and suppress terrorist\r\nacts requires cooperation among States and among\r\nvarious international and regional organizations,\r\nespecially through exchange of information, mutual\r\nlegal assistance and cooperation among police and\r\nintelligence forces. The criminal and international\r\nnature of terrorist acts demands the prosecution and\r\npunishment of their perpetrators in all countries, by all\r\nlegal systems. That is a clear obligation of States under\r\ninternational law and is now confirmed by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001). International\r\ncooperation in prosecuting terrorists is our common\r\nobligation.\r\nIt is, of course, very important to understand,\r\naddress and eradicate the long-term roots of terrorism.\r\nIt is necessary to understand the political, economic,\r\nphilosophical, ideological and even religious roots of\r\nterrorism. But the search for the root causes of\r\nterrorism should in no way hinder our joint action and\r\nour strict fulfilment of Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001).\r\nAfter what happened on 11 September, we do not\r\nneed to wait to have a precise and comprehensive\r\ndefinition of terrorism. Crimes such as those\r\ncommitted on that infamous day are simply horrible,\r\nheinous crimes against innocent people, against\r\nhumanity, against all religions. They are simply crimes\r\nagainst us all, no matter what the motivations behind\r\nthem.\r\nNew terrorist threats are emerging. The Internet,\r\nthe global communications systems and new\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\ntechnologies in general are easily accessible and can be\r\nused for such terrorist purposes as well. The enormous\r\nfinancial gains from illicit trafficking and transactions,\r\nas well as the abundant availability of weapons, from\r\nsmall arms to the more sophisticated ones, might create\r\neven more dangerous types of terrorism. The use of\r\nchemical and biological weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction by terrorists remains acute. States must be\r\never more vigilant and should cooperate closely to\r\ndeny access to such materials and delivery systems to\r\nthe terrorists.\r\nSince 1972, when the problem of international\r\nterrorism was first brought before the General\r\nAssembly, the international community has worked\r\ncontinuously, though maybe not vigorously enough, on\r\nmeasures to combat international terrorism. Over the\r\nyears, we have nevertheless created a network of\r\ninternational legal instruments aimed at combating\r\nterrorism, on both the universal and regional scales.\r\nSpecific crimes require specific treatment and the\r\navailability of various legal instruments makes possible\r\nthe degree of diversification necessary to ensure the\r\nlegal and practical effectiveness of each relevant legal\r\ninstruments. Slovenia has succeeded or acceded to a\r\nnumber of international conventions; to those which\r\ndeal specifically with unlawful acts against the safety\r\nof aircraft; to the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected\r\nPersons, including Diplomatic Agents; to the\r\nInternational Convention against the Taking of\r\nHostages; to the Convention on the Physical Protection\r\nof Nuclear Materials; and to the European Convention\r\non the Suppression of Terrorism, to mention just a few.\r\nThe delegation of Slovenia participates in all\r\nmeetings of the Ad Hoc Committee established by\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/210, endeavouring to\r\ndraft a comprehensive convention on combating\r\ninternational terrorism. We are all aware of the\r\nproblems so well highlighted by the Legal Counsel, Mr.\r\nCorell, at the meeting of the Security Council on 21\r\nSeptember. Nevertheless, we believe that decisive\r\nprogress should and could now be made.\r\nAs for the relationship between the\r\ncomprehensive convention and the sectoral\r\nconventions, we believe that we should preserve\r\nmechanisms already created by the partial conventions\r\nwithout, however, undermining the mechanisms that\r\nmight be established by the comprehensive convention.\r\nBoth mechanisms could be applied simultaneously if\r\nan effective relationship were established, and we\r\nbelieve that it can be established. Slovenia hopes that\r\nthe work of the Ad Hoc Committee will proceed\r\nsuccessfully at its coming session and is ready and\r\nwilling to contribute to it.\r\nLet me conclude by stressing once again\r\nSlovenia’s firm condemnation of all acts of terrorism,\r\nno matter what the so-called purpose or who the\r\nperpetrators might be. The cooperation of the\r\ninternational community as a whole is essential to\r\nfighting terrorism in all its aspects and manifestations.\r\nIf we want to secure a better world, free of terrorism,\r\nand to protect effectively our citizens, our freedoms,\r\nour values and our goods, we have to cooperate; we\r\nhave to put the United Nations, our Organization, at the\r\ncentre of endeavours to eradicate terrorism and its\r\nroots: hatred, fanaticism, discrimination, poverty and\r\nall kinds of injustices.\r\nSlovenia strongly supports Security Council\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001). By these\r\nresolutions, all Members of the United Nations — all\r\nof us — are obliged, legally bound according to the\r\nCharter, to unite our endeavours against terrorists and\r\nterrorism. There should be no hesitation, no excuse —\r\nwe are simply bound to comply in good faith with\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001). We are\r\nbound by deeds, not only by verbal declarations, to\r\nstop terrorists and terrorism.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia): At the outset, allow me\r\nto congratulate Mr. Han on his election to preside over\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.\r\nIn Ethiopia, 11 September has for centuries been\r\nmarked as the beginning of the new year. Three weeks\r\nago, with the shocking, devastating and criminal\r\nterrorist acts committed in New York, Washington,\r\nD.C., and Pennsylvania, thousands of innocent lives\r\nwere lost and millions all over the United States and\r\nthe world mourned. For us in Ethiopia, it was no longer\r\nthe usual 11 September of yesteryears. With the crime\r\ncommitted at the World Trade Center, in our host city, a\r\nred line has been crossed by international terrorists.\r\nThe attack was not only against the people of the\r\nUnited States, but — as many here have said — against\r\nall of humanity. New York, as host to the United\r\nNations, is indeed the political capital of the world.\r\nHence, never before have terrorists mortally hit all\r\nnations at the same time, as happened at the World\r\nTrade Center buildings on 11 September.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nI would like to reiterate here Ethiopia’s strong\r\ncondemnation of those who planned and carried out\r\nthese acts, which fill us with revulsion. My country\r\nonce again expresses its deepest-felt condolences to the\r\npeople and Government of the United States. Our\r\nsympathies also goes to the bereaved families in the\r\nmore than 80 countries, including Ethiopia, whose\r\ncitizens also perished in the evil attacks. During his\r\naddress to this Assembly on Monday, Mayor Giuliani\r\nasked each of us — as I am sure we all remember — if\r\nhe could tell the families of the victims whether they\r\nhave our support. I say to the Mayor and to the families\r\nof the victims: you do indeed have Ethiopia’s full\r\nsupport.\r\nTerrorism is multifaceted. It therefore demands\r\nextraordinary collaboration among States to combat the\r\ndanger it presents. Terrorism is the use of violence or\r\nthe threat of violence to create a climate of fear in a\r\ngiven population. This it does by maiming and killing\r\nindiscriminately. We must not allow the climate of fear\r\nto overcome us. The people and the leaders of New\r\nYork City have shown that they have not succumbed to\r\nthe barbarism visited upon them.\r\nAs someone who has survived three terrorist\r\nattacks, I can say that I have come out of it, with God’s\r\nhelp, the stronger. Certainly, it has only increased my\r\nown determination that we should defeat international\r\nterrorism.\r\nAll countries must declare that terrorism in\r\nwhatever form is unjustifiable. I fully agree with my\r\nSlovenian colleague, who said this in almost exactly\r\nthe same words. Those who propagate or condone the\r\npursuit of political objectives by terrorist means must\r\nbe told unequivocally that it is unacceptable.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has said:\r\n“All nations of the world must be united ... in\r\ntheir determination to take action ... both against\r\nthe terrorists themselves and against all those\r\nwho give them any kind of shelter, assistance or\r\nencouragement.” (A/56/PV.1)\r\nMy Government fully agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The people and the Government of Ethiopia\r\nhave, over the past 10 years in particular, been at the\r\nforefront in the fight against terrorism. Our capital city\r\nand other towns, as well as specific border areas, have\r\nbeen subjected to terrorist attacks.\r\nIf we look back in history, we find that the first\r\nhijacking of a commercial airliner was that of an\r\nEthiopian Airlines aeroplane in the mid-1960s. That\r\nled Ethiopia to take serious security measures,\r\nincluding the use of air marshals. As a victim of and a\r\npioneer in the struggle against terrorism, we\r\nwholeheartedly support all struggles against terrorism,\r\nwhether in Ethiopia, in our subregion or at the global\r\nlevel. To fight this scourge of humanity, countries must\r\nshare intelligence and improve and coordinate security\r\narrangements both within and along their borders.\r\nThe Ethiopian Government, for its part, has taken\r\nvarious legislative and administrative measures aimed\r\nat combating terrorism — among them the tightening\r\nof border security, stringent immigration rules and\r\nairport safety provisions. At the regional level,\r\nEthiopia has been one of the major driving forces\r\nbehind the adoption of the Organization of African\r\nUnity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of\r\nTerrorism. Internationally, Ethiopia has signed and\r\nacceded to a number of sectoral conventions and\r\ntreaties pertaining to terrorism. In this spirit, we\r\nwelcome and fully support Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001).\r\nCooperation among States in the fight against\r\nterrorism must be based on international law and on the\r\nmaximum participation of States Members of this\r\nOrganization. The international community must arm\r\nitself with clear and effective instruments which\r\nrespect human rights and at the same time address the\r\npolitical and economic problems serving as factors of\r\ninstability, which terrorist groups take advantage of.\r\nSerious thought must be given to questions underlying\r\nthe vast disparities in development between North and\r\nSouth. Specifically, the problems of poverty as a\r\npotential breeding ground for terrorism must not be\r\noverlooked. The early adoption of a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism must therefore be\r\na major priority for all of us. In this context, my\r\ndelegation supports the draft submitted by India to the\r\nSixth Committee as a basis for arriving at such a\r\nconvention. It is important to show flexibility and\r\npolitical will so that work on the draft comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism can be completed\r\nthus closing the existing gaps in the legal regime for\r\ncombating terrorism.\r\nAs many previous speakers have stated, terrorism\r\nis not associated with any particular religion, race or,\r\nfor that matter, civilization. In the fight against\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nterrorism, we should not allow ourselves to be carried\r\naway into our own narrow corners of ignorance and\r\nbigotry. Those who pose questions of superiority of one\r\ncivilization over another, while forgetting their own\r\nrecent negative history, reduce the capacity of the\r\ninternational community to build a strong and\r\nmeaningful coalition against terrorism. Whether they\r\nknow it or not, utterances by such individuals will only\r\nhelp terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nreiterate two points.\r\nFirst, there is an urgent need for an agreement on\r\na comprehensive convention to fight international\r\nterrorism. While it is important to have a precise legal\r\ndefinition of terrorism, I agree with Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nthat\r\n“There can be no acceptance of those who would\r\nseek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent\r\ncivilian life, regardless of cause or grievance.”\r\n(A/56/PV.12)\r\nSurely the peoples of the world whom we represent\r\nhere will not understand or forgive us if we fail to\r\nquickly arrive at an agreed comprehensive convention\r\nbecause some of us may descend to being pedantic. I\r\nhope that that will not happen.\r\nSecondly, it is important and fitting that the\r\nUntied Nations should act as the focal forum for\r\ncombating international terrorism. However, it must\r\nalso not be forgotten that if and when terrorists do\r\nattack a country, as happened on 11 September, that\r\ncountry has the legitimate right to defend itself.\r\nFurthermore, it has an obligation to its people to seek\r\nout those who planned, funded, encouraged and\r\nharboured the terrorists, and to hold them accountable.\r\nMr. Al-Hussein (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han on his election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I am\r\nconfident that his experience and wisdom will ensure\r\nthe success of the work of this session and of our\r\ndiscussions, which we hope will benefit the\r\ninternational community as a whole. I also extend my\r\nthanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, for his outstanding efforts in guiding the\r\nprevious General Assembly session to such success.\r\nI would also like, on behalf of the King and the\r\npeople of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, to extend\r\nmy sincere condolences to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America over the\r\ngreat loss of innocent civilian life and the material\r\ndamage resulting from the terrorist attacks that targeted\r\nofficial and civilian American institutions.\r\nJordan once again reaffirms its unchanging and\r\nlong-standing rejection of terrorism in all its forms and,\r\nin particular, condemns in the strongest terms the\r\nincidents in Washington D.C., New York and\r\nPennsylvania. I stress that we will support the United\r\nStates and stand ready to provide any assistance\r\nnecessary to deal with this situation.\r\nThe long-standing Jordanian position is based on\r\nthe idea that terrorism in all its forms is a crime against\r\nhumanity and a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity, and that terrorism is one of the major reasons\r\nfor conflicts in the world and an incitement to hatred\r\nbetween peoples. Jordan considers these crimes to be\r\nan aggression against the fundamental human rights to\r\nlife, security, progress and prosperity, and an\r\naggression against the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations. Terrorism serves no legitimate\r\npurpose. On the contrary, it leads to depriving rightful\r\nowners of the legal means of obtaining their rights in\r\naccordance with international law. In this respect, we\r\nmust distinguish between the right of people to self-\r\ndetermination and to resist foreign occupation on the\r\none hand, and, on the other, blind terrorism, which\r\ntargets innocent people.\r\nJordan appeals to everyone not to confuse\r\nterrorist activities with Arab culture and the Islamic\r\nreligious law of shariah, which prohibits the harming\r\nof civilians, even in wartime, and which calls for\r\ntolerance, justice, peace and the rejection of injustice\r\nand aggression. Many of the norms of international and\r\nhumanitarian laws found in the principles of the Hague\r\nConventions and the four Geneva Conventions were\r\nprescribed by the Islamic shariah more than 14\r\ncenturies ago.\r\nThe peoples of the world, including Arab and\r\nMuslim people, have not escaped the evil scourge of\r\nterrorism, which has led to many innocent civilians\r\nbeing killed. Therefore, it is important that we\r\nconsolidate international efforts to work collectively in\r\na comprehensive framework to combat terrorism in all\r\nits forms, particularly since the danger of the\r\nphenomenon of terrorism is not limited to a specific\r\nState, or just one part of the world; terrorism’s impact\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nextends to harming the whole international community,\r\nwithout exception.\r\nWe have to fight terrorism in all its aspects, such\r\nas instigation to terrorism and sources of financing and\r\ntraining. In this regard, the Jordanian Government has\r\ntaken many national measures to combat terrorism,\r\nfrom which Jordan has often suffered as a result of\r\ndifficult political regional and international conditions.\r\nOn the national level, requisite punitive legislation was\r\nenacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities, bring\r\nperpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of\r\nsuch acts. Jordanian banking regulations safeguard the\r\ntransparency of all financial transactions so that we can\r\ndetect and track all suspect sources of financing and\r\nprevent them from being used for illegal purposes. In\r\naddition, the Jordanian Government works tirelessly to\r\nprevent terrorist acts before they occur.\r\nAt the regional and international levels, Jordan\r\ncooperates with many other countries to prevent and\r\nsuppress terrorist crimes. Jordan has concluded many\r\nbilateral and international agreements to cooperate in\r\njudicial matters. It has also signed or ratified 11\r\ninternational and regional conventions and agreements\r\nto combat terrorism. The last of these was the Arab\r\nConvention on the Suppression of Terrorism, in 1998,\r\nand the International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nthe Financing of Terrorism, in 1999.\r\nJordan ceaselessly cooperates with various\r\ncountries and relevant international organizations to\r\ntake effective legal measures to protect human life and\r\nproperty, as well as to prosecute anyone who attacks\r\nthem. Jordan will continue to pursue all these\r\nendeavours in cooperation with many other countries in\r\norder to put an end to the phenomenon of terrorism,\r\nwhich imperils international peace and security and\r\ncauses suffering for all peoples.\r\nIn accordance with this position, and on the basis\r\nof the principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nJordan expresses its support for the United Nations\r\nresolutions aimed at eradicating the phenomenon of\r\nterrorism. The last of these was Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), adopted on 28 September,\r\ncalling on all countries to cooperate with each other\r\nand with the Security Council to achieve the objectives\r\nof the resolution and implement its d provisions.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco) (spoke in French): On 11\r\nSeptember, disbelief gave way to horror in the face of\r\nthe unprecedented violence and magnitude of the\r\nterrorist attacks against the United States of America.\r\nHis Serene Highness the Sovereign Prince of\r\nMonaco immediately conveyed his condolences to\r\nPresident Bush and assured him of the solidarity of his\r\nGovernment and all the citizens of Monaco. Allow me,\r\nin these terrible circumstances, to reiterate to the\r\nauthorities and people of the United States the\r\ncompassion and solidarity of the authorities and people\r\nof the Principality. We also convey our most profound\r\nsympathy to all those, the nationals of more than 80\r\nnations, affected by these barbarous acts.\r\nMy country felt that it itself had been struck to its\r\nfoundations, as did all States whose institutions rest on\r\ndemocratic principles, respect for the human person\r\nand the rule of law, values upon which our societies are\r\nbased, as is the international community gathered at the\r\nUnited Nations. Its commitment to defending those\r\nvalues is therefore absolute.\r\nIn this spirit, the United Nations immediately and\r\nunequivocally condemned on 12 September those\r\nunjustifiable criminal acts, in the first resolution to be\r\nadopted at the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly, which stresses that the perpetrators,\r\norganizers and sponsors of those acts will have to\r\nanswer for them, while the Security Council took\r\nsimilar action by adopting resolution 1368 (2001).\r\nThe Principality of Monaco fully adheres to the\r\nterms of those resolutions and to the terms of all other\r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions\r\ncondemning acts of terrorism, which represent a threat\r\nto international peace and security. We particularly\r\nrecall Security Council resolution 1333 (2000) of 19\r\nDecember 2000, which invoked Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter expressly in regard to the Taliban.\r\nIn order to preserve our common principles, as\r\nstated in the Charter, while protecting the peoples from\r\nthis now worldwide scourge of terrorism, the\r\nPrincipality’s Government believes that we must\r\ncommit ourselves in a spirit of solidarity to supporting\r\nand strengthening the work of the Ad Hoc Committee\r\ncreated in 1996 by resolution 51/210. Thanks to the\r\nwork of that Committee, our Assembly was able to\r\nadopt the International Convention for the Suppression\r\nof Terrorist Bombings in 1997 and, in December 1999,\r\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nThe political will of the Principality of Monaco\r\nwas reflected in particular by its ratification of the\r\nformer on 6 September 2001 and by the firm intention\r\ndemonstrated on several occasions to sign the latter\r\nbefore the end of this year. On behalf of the highest\r\nauthorities of the Principality, I solemnly reiterate this\r\ncommitment here. In addition, I would like to point out\r\nthat the Principality of Monaco will very soon deposit\r\nits instrument of accession to the International\r\nConvention against the Taking of Hostages.\r\nMy country is party to the conventions of the\r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization concerning\r\nthe safety of aviation, in particular the Convention on\r\nOffences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board\r\nAircraft, the Convention for the Suppression of\r\nUnlawful Seizure of Aircraft and the Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of\r\nCivil Aviation. It is also a party to the Convention on\r\nthe Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of\r\nDetection.\r\nThe Government of Monaco is convinced that\r\nstrengthening the international legal order is one of the\r\ncornerstones for intergovernmental action to combat\r\nand eliminate international terrorism in all of its forms\r\nand manifestations, regardless of where such acts may\r\nbe committed or who the perpetrators may be. We are\r\nconvinced that the diligence of the international\r\ncommunity will be decisive for the completion of the\r\ndraft convention on the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism and the draft general convention on\r\ninternational terrorism. The delegation of Monaco will\r\nalso associate itself with the efforts under way that\r\nshould enable us, based on experience, rapidly to\r\ncomplement the already existing arsenal of legal\r\ninstruments.\r\nIn facing universal crimes such as those we have\r\nrecently witnessed, the response can only be a wholly\r\nuniversal one. The United Nations, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly recalled, must therefore be the central\r\nelement for international cooperation to combat the\r\ncrime of terrorism. We unreservedly share this view.\r\nIn dealing with networks that can so easily and\r\neffectively use the world banking system, international\r\ncooperation to combat transnational organized crime\r\nand the criminal use of the international financial\r\nsystem must be strengthened, and very quickly so. The\r\nPrincipality of Monaco was among the first States to\r\nsign and ratify the Convention against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime. It is also party to the first two\r\nProtocols to this Convention that must play a basic role\r\nin the struggle against all types of criminal networks\r\ninvolving persons or groups installed simultaneously in\r\nvarious countries.\r\nMy country, which is not yet a member of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, has, inter alia, requested the\r\nCouncil of Ministers of that organization to allow it to\r\nbecome a party to the European convention dealing\r\nwith money-laundering and the detection, seizure and\r\nconfiscation of the proceeds of crime. It hopes to\r\nobtain a favourable response to its request as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nThe Security Council, acting under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter, has, through resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nprovided a strong new impetus to the war against the\r\nfinancing of terrorism. The creation of a Committee\r\ndesigned to follow up the implementation of the\r\nprovisions of that resolution and the request made to\r\nMember States to report to it the measures that they\r\ntake within a 90-day period are evidence of the strong\r\npolitical will that we will have to maintain until this\r\nscourge it totally eliminated.\r\nI would like to emphasize that Monaco is in a\r\nposition, based on its commitment to existing\r\nconventions, to take measures immediately on its\r\nterritory to satisfy the demands of the Security Council\r\nand those of the United States regarding the freezing of\r\nthe assets of individuals and groups. The appropriate\r\ninstructions have already been given to banking\r\ninstitutions, while at the same time steps have been\r\ntaken to strengthen the legal and normative basis of\r\nexisting national legislation for the suppression of acts\r\nof terrorism and associated activities.\r\nMonaco’s information and monitoring service for\r\nthe financial system is working in close cooperation\r\nwith its European and American counterparts, and with\r\nall the necessary determination in order to help deprive\r\nterrorist groups and those who support them of\r\nfinancing.\r\nWith the assistance of the International Criminal\r\nPolice Organization in particular, the police and legal\r\nauthorities of Monaco are now engaged in carrying out\r\nthe necessary investigations. A list of names of persons\r\ndrawn up by the American authorities is the subject of\r\ndetailed and in-depth study, and the Monaco Bank\r\nAssociation has been dealing appropriately with the\r\nsituation. Any indication of the presence in Monaco of\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nsuch individuals, property, or assets would immediately\r\ngive rise to legal proceedings.\r\nThe recent events have led the authorities in\r\nMonaco to plan to expand, speed up and increase the\r\neffectiveness of all services that could, directly or\r\nindirectly, deal with activities concerning terrorism.\r\nThe international community must henceforth\r\ndemonstrate its unflinching determination and a new\r\nand genuine solidarity so that justice can be done, and\r\nso that human tragedies as immense as the one we have\r\njust experienced cannot be repeated. By adopting the\r\nMillennium Declaration, our Heads of State and\r\nGovernment made commitments to that end and set\r\nobjectives. More than ever before, let us act together to\r\nadvance the cause of peace and security throughout the\r\nworld, the fundamental mission of our Organization,\r\nand act on these commitments that they have given\r\npride of place.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco, fully aware of the\r\nimportance of this imperative, is ready, I can assure the\r\nAssembly, to share it unequivocally with all Member\r\nStates.\r\nMs. Suñé Pascuet (Andorra)(spoke in French): I\r\nwish first of all to express my sincere condolences and\r\ncompassion to the people of the United States for the\r\ntragedy that afflicted them last week. I also wish to\r\nexpress our solidarity to the families of the victims of\r\nall countries, whose nationals are still missing after the\r\natrocious terrorist act.\r\nToday we are discussing the specific role to be\r\nplayed by the United Nations in confronting the threat\r\nof international terrorism. Indeed, it has seldom been\r\nthe case that so many have raised their voices in horror\r\nand suffering at the terrible acts committed on 11\r\nSeptember. Therefore, this consensus should help us to\r\nbetter target this scourge.\r\nAndorra has been characterized by seven\r\ncenturies of peace and by economic and social\r\ndevelopment that has benefited all its inhabitants. This\r\nwell-being makes us all the more aware of the present\r\nsituation and compels us to direct our efforts towards a\r\nstrategy to eradicate this scourge. We are undoubtedly\r\nconfronting a unique type of conflict because of its\r\nscope and nature. Therefore, we must reflect and act to\r\nguarantee freedom and security for our citizens.\r\nWhat can the United Nations do? This question\r\nhas been repeatedly asked during the last few days, and\r\nwe have all been asked about the role our Organization\r\ncan play starting now. As it was said last week at the\r\ndebate on the Secretary-General’s report, we have to be\r\nable to recreate our work, because part of our\r\ncredibility will depend on the ability to do that.\r\nOver the sessions of the past few years,\r\nparticularly in the Sixth Committee, the concept of\r\ninternational terrorism has been analysed and debated.\r\nInternational instruments of prevention and suppression\r\nof terrorism have been drawn up, and the need to create\r\nother conventions that will protect us from this threat\r\ncontinue to be considered. This task must be a priority\r\non our agenda.\r\nAndorra condemns terrorism in all its aspects and\r\nfights it with unambiguous domestic legislation,\r\nparticularly in the area of money-laundering. Further,\r\nthe Ministry for Foreign Affairs has given instructions\r\nto initiate, with the greatest priority and timeliness, the\r\nexamination of international instruments to combat\r\nterrorism, which must be one of the pillars of our joint\r\nwork.\r\nWe appeal to the international community from\r\nthis rostrum to act in coordination in all these areas\r\nbecause it is the sum of our efforts that will lead to the\r\ndesired results. We welcome Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) because it is a great step\r\ntowards achieving the ultimate goal.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the task\r\nbefore us will be long and difficult, but if the United\r\nNations wishes to continue being a forum of discussion\r\nfor peace and the progress of peoples, then it must\r\nassume this responsibility.\r\nMr. Dos Santos (Mozambique): Allow me to\r\nbegin by joining previous speakers in congratulating\r\nthe President on his election as President of the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are convinced\r\nthat under his wise and skilful leadership our work will\r\nbe crowned with success. He may rest assured that my\r\ndelegation will collaborate and cooperate with him.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Mozambique, on\r\nbehalf of the people and Government of Mozambique,\r\nhas expressed, and we reiterate, our profound sympathy\r\nand condolences to the Government and people of the\r\nUnited States of America for the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember. Our sentiments are also extended to the\r\nrepresentatives of those nations that lost their citizens\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nand to all bereaved families. We share their pain and\r\nsorrow.\r\nI also want to reiterate my Government’s\r\nunequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attacks in\r\nNew York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11\r\nSeptember. These abominable and senseless acts are\r\ncriminal and unjustifiable under any circumstances.\r\nWe pay tribute to all those involved in rescue\r\noperations and those giving invaluable support to the\r\nvictims.\r\nWe are gathered here in solidarity, as the United\r\nNations, to reaffirm our commitment and dedication to\r\nthe principles and purposes enshrined in the Charter\r\nand to act in their defence.\r\nAs reflected in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral before us, international terrorism has always\r\nbeen recognized and reflected in the contemporary\r\nprinciples of international law and other relevant rules\r\nof international law as a scourge that all nations must\r\ncombat as part of their international obligations.\r\nThe United Nations has been and remains central\r\nto international efforts to combat terrorism. The 1994\r\nDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate International\r\nTerrorism and its 1996 Supplement constitute a\r\nlandmark in the concerted international efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nDisturbed by the increase of acts of international\r\nterrorism in its different forms and manifestations in\r\nmany regions of the world and recognizing terrorism as\r\na threat to international peace and security, the General\r\nAssembly has decided to launch a new international\r\nfight against terrorism by calling for a strengthening of\r\ninternational cooperation and progressive development\r\nof international law and its codification.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the work done by the\r\nAd Hoc Committee established by General Assembly\r\nresolution 51/210 and that done by the working group\r\nof the Sixth Committee on developing a more\r\ncomprehensive legal framework for the prevention and\r\nsuppression of international terrorism.\r\nAs a result of the work done by the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee and by the working group of the Sixth\r\nCommittee, the General Assembly adopted, in 1997,\r\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings and, in 1999, the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism, which represent concrete achievements in\r\nthe implementation of the 1994 Declaration and its\r\n1996 supplement.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Committee and the working group of\r\nthe Sixth Committee are also elaborating a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\nand an international convention for the suppression of\r\nacts of nuclear terrorism. We want to take this\r\nopportunity to thank the delegation of India for the\r\ninitiative to present for negotiation a draft\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism,\r\nand we call for a speedy completion of this convention\r\nof fundamental importance. We also call for further\r\nefforts to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the\r\ncompletion of the international convention for the\r\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.\r\nIt is vital that all United Nations Member States\r\nwork towards signing and ratifying the 12 conventions\r\nand protocols already adopted, for they represent the\r\nlegal foundations upon which we can build our\r\ncollective action against terrorism. In this context, the\r\nproposal by the Non-Aligned Movement calling for an\r\ninternational high-level conference under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations is an important and useful\r\ninitiative that must be finalized to formulate a joint,\r\norganized response to international terrorism.\r\nTerrorism knows no boundaries and no permanent\r\nor defined targets. Not so long ago, some countries in\r\nour region experienced tragedies provoked by terrorist\r\nacts. The terrorist bombings of 1998 in Kenya and\r\nTanzania are clear examples of the nature of terrorism\r\nand its total disregard for the life of innocent and\r\ndefenceless people regardless of their geographical\r\nlocation, race, religious belief or political orientation.\r\nThese events and many others elsewhere in the world,\r\nincluding those of 11 September, have proved that only\r\nconcerted international action can prevent such\r\ntragedies.\r\nAll States must work together in a coordinated\r\nmanner to prevent the use of their territories by\r\nterrorists. They must also prevent the financing,\r\ntraining, instigation and organization of terrorists by\r\nany party whatsoever, regardless of any political,\r\nphilosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or\r\nother considerations that may be invoked to justify\r\ntheir acts.\r\nThe international community must reinforce its\r\nresolve to face the challenge of eliminating the scourge\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nof terrorism once for all. The United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects is certainly a\r\ncontribution to the collective combat against terrorism.\r\nThe effective implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction adopted by consensus at the Conference will go\r\na long towards limiting access to these weapons by\r\nterrorist groups and individuals. The effective\r\nimplementation of all other similar initiatives will be\r\ncrucial to limit the possibility of use by terrorists of\r\ndifferent kinds of weapons, including those of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nThe fight against terrorism is multifaceted. That\r\ncan be easily understood by the words of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in a recent interview: “I think that as part of\r\nthat fight we should intensify our efforts to get to the\r\nroot causes” of terrorism.\r\nWe welcome Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), adopted on 28 September, as an immediate and\r\ncomprehensive response to international terrorism as a\r\nthreat to international peace and security. This Security\r\nCouncil resolution will foster the much-needed\r\ntranslation of rhetoric into practical measures.\r\nWe would also like to underline the importance of\r\nregional agreements and declarations to combat and\r\neliminate terrorism in all its forms as a tool to\r\nstrengthen cooperation among Member States and\r\nprovide a platform for an effective implementation of\r\nthe international legal regime to combat terrorism. The\r\nadoption in 1999 of the Organization of African Unity\r\nConvention on the Prevention and Combating of\r\nTerrorism, to which Mozambique is a signatory, is a\r\ncomplementary effort by the African countries to\r\nforestall and combat terrorism.\r\nConscious of the need for effective national\r\nimplementation measures to combat terrorism as a way\r\nto complement the international legal regime,\r\nMozambique has already initiated a comprehensive\r\nreview of international legal instruments to combat and\r\neliminate terrorism with a view to ratifying and\r\nadhering to those to which it is not yet a party. It is our\r\nearnest hope that as a follow-up to this debate, all\r\nMember States will work towards that goal.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme at the outset, to extend my congratulations to\r\nMr. Han on his election as President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish him every\r\nsuccess in conducting the work of this session in a\r\nmanner that brings about the attainment of its\r\nobjectives. I would also like to express my\r\nappreciation, on behalf of my delegation, to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless\r\nendeavours and laudable efforts in extremely\r\ncomplicated and difficult international conditions.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the world\r\nsituation is complex and difficult in view of the fact\r\nthat our world today is rife with international conflicts\r\nthat we have not been able to settle and chronic crises\r\nawaiting solutions that would break the spiral of\r\nviolence and suffering threatening our human\r\nexistence.\r\nWe the Members of the United Nations are\r\nmeeting today to discuss a very serious international\r\nphenomenon that has been preying on everyone, and\r\nwill continue to do so unless there is universal\r\ncooperation and solidarity to eliminate it. That\r\nphenomenon is terrorism, which requires the\r\nformulation of comprehensive international plans and\r\napproaches in the context of international legitimacy to\r\nconfront international threats that do not discriminate\r\non the basis of nationality, colour or creed, and which\r\nmost certainly do not recognize any political, social,\r\neconomic or geographical borders between States and\r\npeoples. We should all cooperate in order to deal with\r\nit and eradicate it so that we can look forward to a\r\nbrighter future that provides decent lives for our\r\npeoples instead of disputes, quarrels and the settling of\r\nscores, no matter what the issue.\r\nIn order to accomplish that, we see no framework\r\nmore appropriate and comprehensive than this\r\ninternational Organization, which we feel is the\r\nappropriate and qualified framework to determine the\r\nfuture of our world. It is incumbent upon all of us,\r\nirrespective of our narrow interests and political\r\ncalculations, to provide the United Nations and its\r\nagencies with all the necessary resources to enable\r\nthem to undertake that important role.\r\nThe threat of terrorism, which has preoccupied us\r\nall for some time, has now become a more serious and\r\nconcrete reality. This was borne out by the attacks that\r\ntargeted important sites in the United States of America\r\non 11 September 2001, which claimed the lives of large\r\nnumbers of American citizens and other innocent\r\npeople. In that regard the Cabinet of the State of Qatar,\r\nat its regular meeting on 12 September 2001, presided\r\nover by His Highness Sheikh Jassem bin Hamad Al-\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nThani, the Heir Apparent expressed the regrets of the\r\nState of Qatar and its condemnation of the terrorist\r\nattacks to which the United States was subjected. The\r\nCabinet also expressed the condolences and sympathy\r\nof the Emir of the State of Qatar and its Government\r\nand its people to the Government of the United States\r\nand its friendly people. The Cabinet also extended\r\ncondolences to the bereaved families, to the American\r\nPresident and the American people, emphasizing the\r\nlong-standing position of the State of Qatar to condemn\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, regardless\r\nof its source.\r\nMoreover, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin\r\nKhalifa Al-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, is\r\ncurrently paying an official visit to the United States of\r\nAmerica, during which he will visit New York and\r\nWashington, D.C., to meet senior officials and assure\r\nthem of the sympathy of the State of Qatar and its\r\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms. Also,\r\nSheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr Al-Thani, the\r\nForeign Minister of the State of Qatar, in his capacity\r\nas Chairman of the Ninth Summit Conference of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC),\r\nexpressed the OIC’s condemnation and denunciation of\r\nthe terrorist attacks unleashed against the United\r\nStates. He stressed that Islam is a religion that\r\ncondemns and rejects terrorism, renounces violence\r\nand bloodshed, advocates the preservation of human\r\nlife and denounces aggression against innocent people.\r\nIt is a religion of tolerance and love. He also said that\r\nthe Islamic world shares the pain and suffering of the\r\nUnited States, its people and its Government, and\r\nextends its sympathy and condolences to the bereaved\r\nfamilies of the victims.\r\nMy delegation once again reiterates its\r\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, be it terrorism perpetrated by\r\nindividuals, groups or States. State terrorism is the\r\nmost heinous form of terrorism, as it has an official\r\ncharacter and targets the lives and properties of\r\ninnocent people and violates the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of States and their public facilities.\r\nThe international community should confront terrorism\r\nwith the requisite resolve and firmness, but it must do\r\nso fairly and objectively.\r\nIn that regard, it is regrettable that terrorism is\r\nsometimes linked or equated with a particular group or\r\ngroups of people. In that context, we cannot permit the\r\nmaligning of certain religions. Everyone knows that\r\nsuch accusations levelled at a particular nationality or\r\nreligion have serious negative implications leading to\r\nunacceptable alienation among peoples and nations. It\r\nis truly tragic that while the United Nations is doing its\r\nutmost to bring peoples closer together, there are some\r\nwho are disrupting those relations among peoples by\r\nmaking baseless accusations.\r\nOn a generous invitation from His Highness\r\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the beloved Emir\r\nof the State of Qatar, the Government had the honour\r\nlast month of hosting a group of internationally\r\neminent persons to discuss the best means of uniting\r\nthe points of view of societies to consolidate the\r\nprinciple of dialogue among civilizations. We the\r\npeoples of the United Nations sorely need to narrow\r\nthe gap separating us from each other.\r\nEveryone is aware of the critical role of the mass\r\nmedia in shaping public opinion on any question, be it\r\ndomestic or international, and of its major\r\nresponsibility to observe impartiality and complete\r\nobjectivity in covering events such as those that took\r\nplace in the United States recently. We must recognize\r\nterrorism for what it is, deliberate acts of violence\r\naimed at maiming and killing innocent civilians,\r\nwithout hesitation or mercy, in the pursuit and service\r\nof the objectives of terrorists.\r\nIn the absence of a specific definition of\r\nterrorism, we stress once again the need to differentiate\r\nbetween terrorism, which we strongly condemn, and\r\nacts of legitimate resistance and national struggle\r\nagainst foreign occupation. International law and the\r\nCharter of the United Nations have guaranteed the\r\nlegitimate right of all peoples under foreign occupation\r\nand control to liberate their land. The absence of such a\r\ndefinition has also seriously undermined international\r\nefforts to tackle this grave threat to human society. A\r\ncomprehensive legal definition of terrorism must make\r\na clear distinction between terrorism, on one hand, and\r\nthe legitimate struggle of peoples, on the other hand. It\r\nshould take into account all forms of terrorism,\r\nincluding State terrorism and the threat of the use of\r\nnuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction.\r\nLast but not least, the fight against terrorism\r\nrequires concerted efforts on the part of the institutions\r\nof all States and on the part of the mass media, which\r\nis of great importance in this regard and which should\r\ncover the question of terrorism objectively and\r\naccurately. We must also find a serious way of\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\ndeveloping a sound framework for an effective legal\r\nmechanism that leads to the formulation of a\r\ncomprehensive international convention to control\r\nterrorism and deal with its root causes. Doing so should\r\nguarantee for future generations a safe and peaceful life\r\nin which the language of dialogue and understanding\r\nprevails, rather than one in which innocent lives are\r\ntaken and peoples’ resources and potentials are\r\nsquandered.\r\nMr. Hashi (Somalia): Allow me to convey my\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. I am confident that, under his wise leadership,\r\nthis session will be a productive one. I would like also\r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan on his re-election as Secretary-General\r\nfor a second term.\r\nOur congratulations to the President and to the\r\nSecretary-General have special significance for us\r\ntoday, since this is the first time in 10 years that a\r\nPermanent Representative of Somalia has addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which signals that Somalia is back\r\non the international scene. In rejoining the international\r\ncommunity, I wish, on behalf of the Government of\r\nSomalia, to thank Member States, the United Nations\r\nand particularly the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for the invaluable contribution to peace-\r\nbuilding efforts in Somalia. I wish also at this juncture\r\nto reaffirm the Somali Government’s commitment to\r\nthe ideals and principles enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe horrific events of 11 September that were\r\nperpetrated against the United States were a flagrant\r\nviolation of those principles. We in Somalia share the\r\ngrief, pain and loss of the people of the United States.\r\nWe share that pain and grief in a very profound way\r\nbecause we in Somalia experienced unnecessary loss of\r\nlife during the civil war. We in Somalia know very well\r\nwhat it means to lose loved ones. The Government and\r\nthe people of Somalia are shocked beyond belief.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to express once\r\nagain our heartfelt condolences to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States. Both the President\r\nand the Prime Minister of Somalia have also conveyed\r\nour heartfelt sympathy to the families of the victims\r\nand to the people and the Government of the United\r\nStates.\r\nPresident Abdikassim Salad Hassan, in his note to\r\nPresident George W. Bush dated 12 September,\r\nexpressed his shock at the tragic death of innocent\r\nUnited States citizens and strongly deplored the\r\ncowardly terrorist action. The Prime Minister of\r\nSomalia expressed similar sentiments, and condemned\r\ninternational terrorism in the strongest terms. In a press\r\nrelease issued on 20 September, the Somali\r\nGovernment stated that terrorism, in all its forms, is an\r\naffront to basic human values. It is also an affront to\r\nthe culture and the basic tenets of Islam.\r\nAs part of Somalia’s contribution to the fight\r\nagainst this evil, our Government formed, on 30\r\nSeptember, a high-powered anti-terrorist task force\r\nincluding the Ministers of the Interior, Defence and\r\nJustice and the Attorney-General. That task force is\r\nmandated to monitor and gather information in every\r\ndistrict of the country and will cooperate with its\r\ncounterparts in other countries as well as with the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretary-General. Somalia’s\r\nanti-terrorist task force is further mandated to ensure\r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001) of 28 September 2001, including its State-level\r\nrequirements. The task force will also examine all\r\ninternational treaties and conventions relevant to the\r\nfight against international terrorism with a view to their\r\nratification.\r\nAs we are aware, terrorists in most cases use false\r\nidentities by procuring passports of other nations. In\r\norder to prevent any possible misuse of its passports,\r\nthe Somali Government has recently printed new\r\nSomali passports with very stringent security features.\r\nThese passports are hard to forge, and their features\r\nmeet the standards of passports of highly developed\r\ncountries. We would like States Members of the United\r\nNations to take note of that fact.\r\nIn addition to the steps I mentioned a moment\r\nago, the Parliament of Somalia, at its tenth session,\r\nconvened on 1 October 2001, issued a declaration\r\nvigorously condemning the terrorist acts of 11\r\nSeptember and strongly supporting Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001.\r\nThe position of the Somali Government on\r\nterrorism is crystal clear. We are committed to the fight\r\nagainst that menace. We will not permit anyone with\r\nany links to terrorism to come to our territory or to\r\noperate in it. We pledge to provide every support to the\r\nfight against international terrorism. We are confident\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nthat the international community will assist us with the\r\nsupport necessary to achieve that goal.\r\nMr. Ortiz Gandarillas (Bolivia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On behalf of the Government and the people\r\nof Bolivia, our President, Mr. Jorge Quiroga Ramírez,\r\nhas conveyed to the President of the United States, Mr.\r\nGeorge W. Bush, our most heartfelt condolences,\r\nsupport and solidarity with the Government of the\r\nUnited States and its noble people. He also vigorously\r\ncondemned the terrorist acts of 11 September.\r\nThe international community, represented and\r\ngathered in this Hall, is speaking out unequivocally and\r\nvigorously to condemn the sinister, unspeakable\r\nterrorist attacks perpetrated in New York, Washington,\r\nD.C., and Pennsylvania. The world has been witness to\r\none of the most horrendous crimes of terrorism,\r\nunequalled and unprecedented in its premeditation and\r\ntreachery. Commercial airliners full of civilians —\r\nmen, women and children — were hijacked and used as\r\nweapons of mass destruction to sow death and\r\ndesolation among innocent people from 80 countries.\r\nOur heartfelt condolences and solidarity go also to\r\nthose countries.\r\nThis is a crime against humanity. It is an act that\r\nflagrantly violated a basic, fundamental right on which\r\nis based the functioning and entire legal, political,\r\nmoral and religious structure of our societies and of\r\nhuman coexistence: respect for the right to life of every\r\nhuman being. A crime has been committed and must\r\nnot go unpunished. No on can claim the right to assault\r\nor kill another human being. The full force of the law\r\nmust fall on the perpetrators and their accomplices and\r\nprotectors.\r\nBolivia condemns this and any other terrorist act,\r\nby whomever committed and towards whomever\r\naimed. International terrorism has become a threat to\r\npeace and security, including to the independence and\r\nsovereignty of States and societies throughout the\r\nworld. It has become a global phenomenon,\r\nrecognizing no borders. Its goal is to destroy; it knows\r\nno law or homeland. It feeds on hatred and resentment\r\nand takes advantage of the conditions of extreme\r\npoverty and of the absence of democratic institutions in\r\nsome societies.\r\nThe international community must now take\r\nmeasures and carry out urgent action to eradicate this\r\nevil. We have a series of conventions and agreements\r\non terrorism, but they do not seem to be enough. We\r\nneed to find more concrete and effective measures,\r\nsuch as, perhaps, a programme or plan of action on\r\ninternational terrorism that would channel further\r\ncooperation among States and grant a clear mandate to\r\nour Organization. In this context, Bolivia joins the\r\ninternational coalition against terrorism in the\r\nframework of the United Nations.\r\nThere exists, alongside the crime of international\r\nterrorism, another scourge is confronting the\r\ninternational community: drugs and drug trafficking.\r\nBoth evils sustain each other; one feeds off the\r\nresources of the other. Drug traffickers protect\r\nthemselves with violence and the crimes of terrorism.\r\nBoth have achieved a global dimension. The response\r\nmust therefore be global too. Here again, the\r\ninternational community must act urgently and with\r\ngreater resolve.\r\nBolivia has suffered the negative consequences of\r\nthis scourge, but it has managed to fight back and\r\nalmost to eliminate it through the total eradication of\r\nthe cultivation of coca, which fed the manufacture of\r\ncocaine. This was not an easy struggle. It required\r\nmuch political will on the part of the Government and a\r\ntremendous effort on the part of the Bolivian people.\r\nThat is how Bolivia has made a decisive contribution to\r\nthe efforts of the international community.\r\nFurthermore, we must also recognize – while in\r\nno way implying any justification of the acts and\r\ncrimes of terrorists and drug-traffickers, wherever they\r\nmay take place — that these phenomena and their\r\ngrowing virulence are bred and nourished in the fertile\r\nbreeding grounds of the extreme poverty that afflicts a\r\ngreat percentage of humanity and that entails hunger,\r\nignorance, disease, frustration and despair. The\r\nBrazilian writer and politician Josue de Castro\r\ndramatically summed up extreme poverty as a\r\ncondition in which children are born not to live, but to\r\ndie.\r\nThe international community, in the context of\r\nthe United Nations, has attempted to respond to these\r\nthree scourges by adopting legal instruments to prevent\r\nand punish international terrorism, to combat drug-\r\ntrafficking and to alleviate extreme poverty. The\r\noutcome reveals our response to have been insufficient\r\nand inadequate. International terrorism has become\r\nmore daring and virulent, drug trafficking persists and\r\nextreme poverty has spread.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nIn the face of such a situation, it is necessary and\r\nessential that we act with greater resolve and\r\ndetermination to shoulder our responsibilities and to\r\nadopt concrete action to avoid, prevent and eradicate\r\nthese barbaric acts. No one can remain indifferent. The\r\nconceptual authors and implementers of these acts\r\nmade a serious mistake in thinking that they were\r\nattacking the United States alone. In fact, the attack\r\nwas directed against the entire international community\r\nand all of humanity.\r\nThat is why the time has come for the\r\ninternational community to send its cry of\r\ncondemnation into every corner of the planet and to say\r\nwithout fear or ambivalence: no to the terror of\r\nterrorism; no to the terror of drug-trafficking; no to the\r\nterror of hunger.\r\nThe world can no longer tolerate or endure these\r\nscourges. We must change direction. I therefore wish to\r\nappeal, with all due respect, to the entire international\r\ncommunity to forge a new world conscience with a\r\nnew vision and new approaches to the problems we are\r\nconfronting today and thus to build a better world in\r\nwhich the values and principles that we all\r\nrecognize — freedom, equality, equity, justice, peace\r\nand well-being — are fully realized to the benefit of\r\nall. To achieve these aspirations, genuine cooperation\r\nand solidarity among all nations is imperative. That is\r\nhow we will build new societies in which we will be\r\nable to say, paraphrasing Josue de Castro, that children\r\nwill be born not to die, but to live.\r\nMr. Vento (Italy): In taking the floor, allow me\r\nfirst of all to express Italy’s full endorsement of the\r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of\r\nBelgium on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe tragedy that struck the United States on 11\r\nSeptember lends even greater urgency to the United\r\nNations activity, both in preventing and fighting\r\ninternational terrorism and in seeking to alleviate the\r\nroot causes of such unprecedented phenomena.\r\nThe United Nations was founded in 1945 for the\r\nbasic purpose of preventing the conflagration of\r\nanother global conflict. Ever since, it has worked to\r\ndevelop the instruments it needs to carry out that\r\nmandate. Sadly, with the arrival of the new millennium,\r\na new threat to international peace and security has\r\nappeared on the horizon — new not so much in its\r\ngenius as in its catastrophic dimensions. To fight that\r\nthreat, the United Nations must once again seek to\r\ndevelop the appropriate instruments, as it has in the\r\nimmediate aftermath of the tragedy.\r\nItaly, in expressing its full solidarity with the\r\nUnited States Government and citizens, particularly the\r\nfamilies and friends of the victims, also underlines its\r\ndetermination to participate resolutely at both the\r\ninternational and national levels in a global strategy\r\nagainst terrorism. Our attitude is inspired by the\r\nconclusions of the extraordinary European Council of\r\n21 September. We fully share the European Union’s\r\nconviction that the coalition against terrorism should\r\nbe as broad as possible and under the aegis of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAlready in July, in its capacity as President, Italy\r\nhad promoted a G-8 condemnation of all forms of\r\nterrorism that stressed the need for enhanced\r\ninternational cooperation on drafting effective\r\nprevention and enforcement strategies. On that same\r\noccasion, the foreign ministers of the eight countries\r\nunderlined the need for the broadest possible\r\nimplementation of the 12 United Nations sectoral anti-\r\nterrorism conventions, including the most recent one\r\non the financing of terrorism.\r\nItaly is also this year’s President of the Group of\r\nCounter-Terrorism Experts, which conducts analytical\r\nstudies of the phenomenon and fosters judicial and\r\nintelligence cooperation. The events of three weeks ago\r\nhave lent even greater importance to the Group’s goal\r\nof drafting effective guidelines for the application of\r\nthe most recent anti-terrorism Convention, which my\r\nGovernment is determined to ratify at the earliest date.\r\nThe horrors of 11 September show that terrorism\r\nconstitutes a global threat that requires an immediate\r\nglobal response. The existence of geographic areas or\r\nlegal loopholes that provide shelter or protection to\r\ncriminals and their interests creates zones of impunity\r\nand represents a grave threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. This threat, as Security Council resolution\r\n1368 (2001) so clearly recognizes, is not against\r\nindividual States or societies, but against the whole set\r\nof values that hold the international community\r\ntogether and lie at the foundation of the United\r\nNations. Therefore today’s challenge is to close these\r\nloopholes; to genuinely bar the road to terrorism and\r\nsuppress its means of support; and to eliminate\r\nimpunity. Resolution 1373 (2001), adopted last Friday,\r\nmeets these demands. The expeditious manner in which\r\nit was adopted by the 15 members of the Security\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nCouncil reflects the new spirit of cooperation against\r\nterrorism and the broad support that has arisen within\r\nthe United Nations and around the world for a\r\ncrackdown on terrorism.\r\nThe resolution strengthens several commitments\r\nalready included in the 12 United Nations sectoral\r\nconventions against terrorism, making them instantly\r\nbinding for all Member States, in the light of Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter. Nevertheless, it still leaves some\r\ngrey zones that should be eliminated if we wish to\r\nachieve a truly global anti-terrorism strategy. The\r\nsectoral approach of the aforementioned conventions\r\nshould thus, in our view, be integrated by a general\r\nlegal instrument that allows the repression of any\r\nterrorist act, wherever and by whomever it is\r\ncommitted. This is why I am joining my voice to the\r\nmany that preceded me, particularly that of the\r\npresidency of the European Union, in underlining that\r\nthe work of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Sixth\r\nCommittee on elaborating a comprehensive\r\ninternational convention should proceed promptly and\r\nwith the broadest and most constructive participation\r\nof all Member States.\r\nWe hope also that the negotiations to define the\r\ntext of an international convention for the suppression\r\nof acts of nuclear terrorism can be resumed as soon as\r\npossible. Finally, we cannot forget that chemical or\r\nbiological weapons could also be among the new and\r\nterrifying instruments involved in the terrorist threat.\r\nEarlier I mentioned the need to eliminate the\r\n“grey zones” of impunity for those who commit\r\nterrorist acts. The aforementioned Security Council\r\nresolution commits all Member States to consider\r\nterrorist acts as serious criminal offences and to ensure\r\nthat the seriousness of such acts is duly reflected in the\r\npunishment meted out to them. But the global nature of\r\nthe threat facing us today and, consequently, the\r\npossibility of a global terrorist act, lend even greater\r\nurgency to the creation of an International Criminal\r\nCourt. To finally endow the international legal system\r\nwith a judicial instrument shared by the whole\r\ncommunity of States, we hope that the 60 ratifications\r\nneeded for the Rome Statute to enter into effect can be\r\nrapidly attained. We agree with the Secretary-General’s\r\nappeal in his recent report on the work of the\r\nOrganization for all Member States to take the decision\r\nto sign and ratify the Statute.\r\nA complementary but no less important role in\r\nthe fight against terrorism is played by the Convention\r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime, adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly last December and opened for\r\nsignature in Palermo at a ceremony attended by 148\r\nMember States. The rapid entry into force of that\r\nConvention and its three protocols — against\r\ntrafficking in human beings, smuggling of migrants and\r\ntrafficking in arms — would be a major step towards\r\nstopping any and all activities that foster, even\r\ncollaterally, terrorist acts.\r\nThe Italian Government is convinced that the\r\ndesire for decisive, lasting results in the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism should not lead us to neglect the\r\nbroader picture. In other words, this fight should be\r\naccompanied by measures aimed at promoting stronger\r\ngovernment institutions; safeguarding the human, civil,\r\neconomic and cultural rights of all communities;\r\nfostering the return of refugees to their homes; and\r\nrebuilding the social and economic fabric. We feel it is\r\nfundamental to participate actively in United Nations\r\nefforts to strengthen the bases of collective security and\r\nto prevent regional conflicts. Therefore we fully\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s recent report on the\r\nissue, which gives the concept of governance the\r\nrequisite consideration in the areas of development and\r\npeace.\r\nWe also feel that a commitment to humanitarian\r\nassistance is crucial, namely with respect to the tragic\r\nsituation of refugees and internally displaced persons.\r\nFor this purpose, we have already allocated $7 million\r\nto the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees. Moreover, our Under-Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Ms. Boniver, has just visited the\r\nAfghan refugee camps on the border of Pakistan.\r\nOn several occasions Italy, together with its\r\nEuropean partners, has underlined the need for a\r\ncomprehensive approach to the problem of\r\ninternational terrorism and for stepped-up cooperation\r\non analysing its root causes, so as to better stop, and\r\neven prevent, such phenomena. In its foreign policy,\r\nthe Italian Government intends to give the necessary\r\nemphasis to actions aimed at eradicating poverty,\r\nfighting HIV/AIDS and other widespread contagious\r\ndiseases, safeguarding the environment and protecting\r\nhuman and social rights. In short, we intend to\r\nresolutely pursue the goal of building a better world,\r\nenshrined in the last year’s report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, entitled “We the people”, which was approved\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\nby the heads of State and Government in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and embraced by the Genoa\r\nSummit of the G-8.\r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Allow me at the\r\noutset to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nand to wish him every success in his new role.\r\nWe are grateful to the Mayor of New York, Mr.\r\nRudolph Giuliani, for the inspiring statement he made\r\non Monday. We take this opportunity to reiterate to\r\nhim, to the people of our host city, New York, and to\r\nthe families of the victims our deepest sympathy\r\nfollowing the tragedy of 11 September. We commend\r\nthe people of the United States for the courage and\r\nresilience they demonstrated, and continue to\r\ndemonstrate, following the terrorist attacks.\r\nThe topic of this debate is of transcendental\r\nimportance to humanity as a whole and, in particular,\r\nto the United Nations, a forum whose responsibilities\r\ninclude the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. This ought to be the guiding principle of our\r\ncommon fight against terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations is a forum wherein all peace-\r\nloving nations can jointly address the ills of the world.\r\nBy employing a well-tested system of participation and\r\nrepresentation, Member States come together in this\r\ngreat city, under the auspices of this noble\r\nOrganization, to debate and agree on principles and\r\nstandards for cohabitation on this fragile planet. In the\r\npast, we have been called upon to debate, and find\r\nsolutions to, problems affecting our occupancy of this\r\nplanet. These range from poverty alleviation and\r\nconflict resolution to health-related issues. This week\r\nwe have been called upon to debate, and contribute to\r\nfinding a solution to, another issue affecting all of us:\r\nterrorism.\r\nTerrorism is a scourge that affects all of us, as it\r\nthreatens the very way of life we have come to cherish.\r\nIt challenges the economic and political institutions we\r\nhave erected; it undermines the principles of\r\ninteraction among States; it negates due process; and,\r\nworst of all, it fails to adhere to internationally\r\naccepted standards for conflict resolution.\r\nTerrorists destroy vital social and economic\r\ninfrastructure in their arbitrarily selected target\r\ncountries. Through their actions, terrorists deprive\r\ninnocent victims of their livelihood. By their very\r\nexistence, terrorists undermine the will of the governed\r\nand the internationally accepted standards and\r\nmechanisms for political participation. Whether their\r\nactions manifest themselves within the host country or\r\nbeyond its borders, their tactics are equally deplorable\r\nand deserving of swift and effective measures to\r\neradicate them from the face of the earth.\r\nThe United Nations must play a crucial role in\r\ncombating international terrorism by adopting a global\r\nstrategy that should include clear political, military,\r\ndiplomatic, economic and legal measures in order to\r\neliminate it. Angola therefore welcomed the adoption\r\nby the Security Council of resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nwhich deals with all aspects of terrorism through a\r\nglobal and holistic approach. The resolution, inter alia,\r\ncalls upon Member States to become party to the\r\nrelevant international conventions relating to terrorism,\r\nincluding the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, of 9\r\nDecember 1999, and we urge all Member States to take\r\nimmediate action to give effect to the provisions of the\r\nresolution.\r\nThe Angolan people have historically suffered the\r\ncarnage resulting from the cruel and horrible acts\r\nperpetrated by UNITA, led by Mr. Savimbi. Those\r\nterrorist organization has caused hundreds of thousands\r\nof deaths and massive damage to the economy and\r\ncreated thousands of refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons. Those acts by UNITA continue to sow death\r\nand undermine the functioning of democratic\r\ninstitutions and the development of the country. In their\r\nessence and objectives, those actions contain all the\r\nelements that characterize the concept of the crime of\r\nterrorism. As such, the international community has, in\r\na timely manner, expressed its condemnation by\r\nimposing sanctions, as in Security Council resolutions\r\n864 (1993), 1127 (1997), 1173 (1998), 1202 (1998) and\r\n1295 (2000).\r\nMore recently, those acts by UNITA were also\r\ncondemned by the Security Council in a statement to\r\nthe press on 16 August 2001 and in a presidential\r\nstatement on 20 September 2001.\r\nAngola has been strengthening its cooperation\r\nand coordination with neighbouring States, in\r\nparticular to combat all crimes connected to terrorism,\r\nincluding drug-trafficking, the illicit arms trade,\r\nmoney-laundering and other such crimes. Angola has\r\nsigned the Organization of African Unity Convention\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.17\r\non the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, of 14\r\nJuly 1999. Angola is also party to the Convention on\r\nOffences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board\r\nAircraft, signed on 14 September 1963; the Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft,\r\nwhich entered into force on 14 October 1971; and the\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts\r\nagainst the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed on 23\r\nSeptember 1971.\r\nWe are grateful to the delegation of India for\r\npresenting the draft comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism. We also appreciate the draft\r\nconvention to combat nuclear terrorism, submitted by\r\nthe Russian Federation. We support the proposals\r\ncontained therein and hope that all members will\r\napproach both drafts in a constructive and productive\r\nmanner with a view to their early adoption.\r\nMember States should be particularly attentive to\r\nterrorists who are in the guise of freedom fighters or\r\nwho act in the name of religion, self-determination and\r\nsovereignty. As the Secretary-General has reminded us,\r\nthe laws of civilized behaviour should apply to all.\r\nIn summary, let me state that we the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations should be determined to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of terrorism;\r\nto reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights, in\r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person and in the\r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\r\nand small; to establish conditions under which justice\r\nand respect for the obligations arising from treaties and\r\nother sources of international law can be maintained;\r\nand to promote social progress and better standards of\r\nlife in larger freedom.\r\nTo conclude, I am confident that the spirit that\r\ncreated this noble Organization will prevail and make a\r\nvery useful contribution to the adoption of relevant\r\nmeasures which will unite us more closely in the fight\r\nto eliminate terrorism. That would be the best way to\r\nhonour the victims of 11 September.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to give the\r\nSecretariat a moment to make an announcement.\r\nMr. Perfiliev (Director, General Assembly and\r\nEconomic and Social Council Affairs Division): I\r\nshould like to draw the attention of delegations to the\r\nnote verbale that has just been distributed in the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. As indicated in and as was\r\nannounced by the President of the General Assembly\r\nthis morning, the general debate for the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly will be held from 10\r\nto 16 November 2001, with two meetings per day from\r\n9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.\r\nI should like to remind delegations that the\r\nPresident indicated this morning that this will result in\r\nfewer hours for statements in the general debate and\r\nurged speakers to limit their statements to 15 minutes.\r\nMembers’ cooperation in this regard will facilitate the\r\nholding of the general debate within the scheduled\r\ntimeframe.\r\nIt would be very helpful for the Secretariat, in\r\nupdating the provisional list of speakers for the general\r\ndebate — and we will update provisional list number 3\r\nfor the general debate, which was issued on 29 August\r\n2001 — if Member States would communicate their\r\nlevel of representation to the Secretariat by Monday, 8\r\nOctober 2001, by 5 p.m. Of course, Members have seen\r\nthat the last number or the fax number on the note\r\nshould be 963-3783.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: There are still more than\r\n80 speakers on the list for agenda item 166, “Measures\r\nto eliminate international terrorism”. In order that we\r\nmay conclude the debate on the item on Friday, 5\r\nOctober, there will be an additional night meeting\r\ntomorrow, 4 October, from 6.30 p.m. to 9 p.m.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
