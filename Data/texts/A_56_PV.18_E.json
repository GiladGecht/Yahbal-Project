(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 166 (continued)\r\nMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/160 and\r\nCorr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): We welcome this\r\nopportunity to speak on the issue of international\r\nterrorism, in the light of recent developments in our\r\nhost country.\r\nThe brazen, despicable acts perpetrated against\r\nthe people of New York and Washington on 11\r\nSeptember 2001 have once again brought close to the\r\nvery doorstep of this Organization the devastating\r\nimpact of such ill-conceived and misguided actions.\r\nThe lingering effects of such diabolical acts have\r\nwounded our collective psyche. The terrorist attacks,\r\neven though directed against the territory of the United\r\nStates, constitute an act against the noble values of\r\nfreedom and the rule of law. Humanity as a whole must\r\nrespond to it in unity.\r\nThe eleventh of September 2001 will forever\r\nstand in the collective memory of humanity as a day of\r\ninfamy.\r\nAt this moment of sorrow and grief, as the people\r\nof New York and Washington count the toll of innocent\r\nlives lost, we commiserate with them and share in their\r\npain and sorrow. Ghana also lost some nationals in the\r\nattacks. We are indeed impressed by the overwhelming\r\nsense of strength, unity, fellowship and generosity that\r\nthe attacks have generated.\r\nThe face of terrorism is one bloodied by its evil\r\nintention. Increasingly, the objectives of today’s\r\nterrorists are suicidal, and, apparently, they have no\r\ndemands to negotiate. We therefore need to move from\r\na culture of reaction to one of prevention. More\r\nimportantly, there is the need to identify, understand\r\nand address the underlying factors that permit such\r\nhatred, however misguided, to grow and fester. It\r\nwould be ironic if, in this Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, the recent terrorist acts were\r\nmisconstrued as a clash of civilizations.\r\nThe unfolding globalized economy has in its\r\nwake created opportunities, albeit temporary, for\r\nterrorist organizations to globalize their operations and\r\nexecute their diabolical plans with speed and deadly\r\naccuracy, sometimes across several countries. No State\r\nis today immune to the brutal wrath of terrorism, even\r\nif the levels of vulnerability vary. We must therefore\r\naddress the problem globally.\r\nThe fight against terrorism is beyond the scope\r\nand capacity of any single State and requires genuine\r\ncooperation on the part of all, at the national, regional\r\nand global levels. This recognition has already been\r\naffirmed by our heads of State and Government. At the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Summit last year, they\r\ndecided\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\n“To take concerted action against international\r\nterrorism, and to accede as soon as possible to all\r\nthe relevant international conventions.”\r\n(resolution 55/2, Millennium Declaration,\r\npara. 9).\r\nCurrently, there are 12 key global conventions\r\nand other regional instruments on terrorism. Hopefully,\r\nthe ongoing work on a draft comprehensive convention\r\non terrorism will soon be completed, and it should\r\nfurther enhance the legal regime within which\r\ninternational cooperation for the fight against terrorism\r\ncan take place.\r\nThe report (A/56/326) of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled, “Road map towards the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration” sets out very\r\nfine strategies for moving forward the resolve of the\r\nHeads of State and Government. The Secretary-General\r\nnotes that States would be encouraged to sign, ratify\r\nand implement the conventions and protocols relating\r\nto terrorism and be assisted in developing and adopting\r\ncorresponding laws and administrative procedures at\r\nthe national level. We appeal to all Member States to\r\nquickly sign, ratify and implement these conventions.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), recently\r\nadopted, has reinforced the international legal regime\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nOn our part, we emphasize the need for States to\r\nclearly and unambiguously identify and constantly\r\nkeep open established channels of communication for\r\nthe regular and speedy exchange of relevant\r\ninformation on terrorist activities, in such a way as to\r\nhelp foil their diabolical plans and decimate the life\r\nsupport systems that keep them operational.\r\nWe must genuinely cooperate and take concerted\r\naction to track and freeze financial and other assets that\r\nmake it possible for terrorist organizations to exist. We\r\nmust strengthen national investigative and enforcement\r\ninstitutions, and, as appropriate, extradite or vigorously\r\nprosecute all cases of terrorism that come within our\r\nrespective jurisdictions. But we must also redeem,\r\nthrough dialogue and assistance, all turf adopted by\r\nterrorist organizations as bases for festering their evil\r\nmachinations.\r\nWe must do all the above things and more, and\r\nspeedily, too. The fight against terrorism will be long\r\nand arduous, and there may not be visible victors. But\r\nthe peace and stability that will prevail will be a\r\nvictory for all mankind. Ghana also looks forward to\r\nparticipating, at an appropriate future date, in the\r\nproposed high-level conference, under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations, to formulate the international\r\ncommunity’s joint organized response to terrorism. We\r\nbelieve that such a conference, which enjoys the high\r\npolitical will of non-aligned member countries, will be\r\nuseful and should carefully choose its priorities and\r\nagenda.\r\nWe recognize as criminal those acts intended or\r\ncalculated to provoke a state of terror among the\r\ngeneral public, who are innocent people. My delegation\r\ncalls for an early definition of the concept of terrorism,\r\nin ways that leave little ambiguity as to what it is and\r\ngalvanize broad international support in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, however defined.\r\nIt is our duty to bequeath to our children and\r\nfuture generations a stable and prosperous world, but\r\nwe cannot attain this objective unless we, individually\r\nand collectively, solemnly rededicate our commitment\r\nto the Charter’s principle of maintaining international\r\npeace and security. Terrorism is indeed a threat to this\r\ncherished principle, and all States are beholden to\r\nensure its complete eradication.\r\nMr. Stanczyk (Poland): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing the heartfelt condolences of my\r\nGovernment to the people and Government of the\r\nUnited States, and especially to the families of the\r\nvictims of the barbaric attack of 11 September.\r\nPoland fully associates itself with the statement\r\nmade on behalf of the European Union by the\r\nrepresentative of Belgium.\r\nThe terrorist attacks that befell our host city and\r\ncountry have left us all in deep shock and disbelief.\r\nThe unparalleled magnitude and barbarity of the\r\nattacks and the loss of human life they entailed have\r\ndemonstrated the destructive potential of terrorism and\r\nthose who stand by it. They have also shown that those\r\nintent on bringing death and destruction do not feel\r\nbound by the moral norms and values shared among\r\ncivilized nations. Their capability to create havoc is\r\nlimited solely by their technical capacity and not by\r\nany considerations of a moral or humanitarian nature.\r\nThere is no doubt that acts of terrorism constitute\r\na most serious violation of the principles of the United\r\nNations and are aimed directly against the ideals which\r\nthis Organization upholds. Moreover, they constitute a\r\nsignificant threat to international peace and security.\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nThe recent tragic events have once again confirmed\r\nthat international terrorism is a global phenomenon. It\r\nknows no boundaries, and its effects are not limited to\r\nany particular country or region. Being a global\r\nchallenge, it demands a global response. And a global\r\nresponse requires, in turn, global cooperation.\r\nThe role that the United Nations, as the only\r\nOrganization with universal participation and\r\ncompetence, should assume in this respect is pivotal in\r\nthe struggle against this scourge of our times. The\r\nmessage that emanates from this forum should be\r\nunambiguous: there will be no tolerance for acts of\r\nterrorism in this world and no safe havens for the\r\nperpetrators and organizers of such atrocious acts.\r\nNothing can justify the loss of innocent human\r\nlives. We fully share the view of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, that the United Nations is uniquely\r\npositioned to develop a broad anti-terrorist coalition.\r\nWhat is now required is development of a long-term\r\nstrategy that would address all aspects of this\r\nphenomenon. An important step in the development of\r\nsuch a strategy has already been taken by the Security\r\nCouncil, when it adopted on 28 September resolution\r\n1373 (2001), in which it called upon States to take\r\nconcrete action and cooperate to prevent and suppress\r\nterrorist attacks. The establishment of a Committee to\r\nmonitor the implementation of this resolution should\r\nsignificantly enhance its practical impact on the way in\r\nwhich States coordinate their efforts to combat\r\nterrorism.\r\nInternational legal instruments play an important\r\nrole in the fight against terrorism. We welcome the\r\nprogress that has been made in this respect in the last\r\nfew years. The adoption of international conventions\r\nfor the suppression of terrorist bombings and for the\r\nsuppression of the financing of terrorism has filled\r\nimportant gaps in the existing legal infrastructure in\r\nthis field. It is incumbent upon us to work relentlessly\r\ntowards further progress in this respect. One cannot\r\noverestimate the significance of an international\r\nconvention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism. We sincerely hope that the remaining\r\ndifferences that stand in the way of the conclusion of\r\nsuch a document will soon be resolved. It is also\r\nimportant that work on the draft of a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism continue in a\r\nconstructive spirit. Such a convention should, in\r\nparticular, contain effective provisions in the field of\r\ninter-State cooperation. Taking into account similarities\r\nin methods employed by terrorist organizations and\r\ncriminal organizations, and possible interrelationships\r\nbetween them, it should also draw upon the United\r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized\r\nCrime. Moreover, this Assembly should launch an\r\nurgent appeal for the universalization of all major\r\ninternational conventions against terrorism.\r\nThe idea of creating a monitoring mechanism to\r\nfacilitate the implementation of the existing\r\nconventions deserves our full support. Such a\r\nmechanism could play an important role in ensuring\r\nthat the conventions are implemented uniformly and\r\nthat their provisions are respected. We should also\r\nmake a comprehensive overview of the existing\r\nconventions so as to evaluate their effectiveness and\r\npossibly identify areas that would require further\r\nregulation.\r\nThe importance of regional and bilateral\r\ncooperation should also be stressed, and steps should\r\nbe taken to facilitate such cooperation, even in the\r\nabsence of a legally binding agreement between the\r\nStates concerned. This is particularly important in the\r\nareas of information exchange and cutting terrorists off\r\nfrom their sources of financing.\r\nPoland attaches great importance to the\r\ninternational standards set in this respect, being a party\r\nto a vast majority of international conventions that\r\nregulate this subject. Moreover, our domestic\r\nlegislation contains specific provisions aimed at\r\neffectively repressing, as well as preventing, terrorist\r\nacts. We will continue our work in adhering to the\r\ninstruments to which we are not yet a party. Today\r\nPoland will sign the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which will\r\nbe another step in this direction.\r\nMr. Naidu (Fiji): Terrorism has fast become an\r\nintellectual concept and the subject of academic\r\ndeliberations in the United Nations in recent years.\r\nNumerous international, regional and bilateral treaties,\r\nconventions and declarations to suppress and prevent\r\nterrorism have been concluded. Mostly, however, these\r\ninstruments address narrow sectoral interests and so\r\nhave limited scope. Good progress has been made this\r\npast year by the Ad Hoc Committee established by\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/210 and the Sixth\r\nCommittee working group on terrorism to elaborate a\r\ncomprehensive international convention, based on a\r\ndraft proposed by India. The exact status of this\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nconvention and of the definition of terrorism are not\r\nsettled and will continue to stifle the elaboration\r\nprocess.\r\nSadly, conventions and treaties have failed to\r\ndeter terrorists from their path of destruction. We all\r\nsaw the world shaken by the mindless terrorist attacks\r\non New York and Washington, D.C., and the tragic loss\r\nof innocent civilian lives.\r\nSince this debate commenced, we have all clearly\r\nagreed that the nationality, ethnicity, creed, religion or\r\nmotives of the attackers are irrelevant. We thus applaud\r\nthe Secretary-General’s call for a broad coalition of\r\nStates to maintain vigilance, cooperate on\r\nextraterritorial legal processes, share technical\r\nexpertise and best-practice models and act as a forum\r\nin which to continue discussions on terrorism. This is\r\nall the more important as terrorism seems to be taking\r\non a geopolitical face to challenge the evolving\r\ninternational order, thereby shaping political scenarios.\r\nLet us not languish in fear of further reprisals or\r\nviolent reactions. This is our opportunity to seize the\r\nnew culture of conflict prevention, driven by the\r\nSecretary-General, as a critical platform for Member\r\nStates to chart our destiny on a course bringing us\r\nmuch closer to international peace and security in the\r\nnew millennium. We agree that in so doing the role of\r\nhis office in peace-brokering inevitably expands and\r\nthat Member States entrust him with this delicate task.\r\nThat is an avenue that Fiji supports.\r\nThe culture of reaction continues the spiral of\r\nintensifying conflict and makes peace elusive. This\r\nspiral is reaching previously unknown dimensions and\r\nextending violations of international humanitarian,\r\nhuman rights and conflict law to new limits.\r\nThe United Nations must now capitalize on the\r\ngroundswell of international solidarity emanating from\r\nthe recent crisis to strengthen dialogue against\r\ninternational terrorism, as we all have in some way\r\nbeen touched by its many forms and manifestations.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)\r\nidentifies these various forms, which often and\r\ninadvertently place Member States in positions of\r\ncompromise with terrorists.\r\nInvariably, Member States engage in illicit drug-\r\ntrafficking, sponsor organized transnational crimes,\r\nlaunder proceeds of crime or terrorism or are crippled\r\nby encroaching pressures of international terrorism\r\nunder the pretext of legitimate economic activities.\r\nOthers actively nurture these elements in foreign\r\njurisdictions for political gains. Some States thrive on\r\ninternal terrorism, lending legitimacy to the\r\npoliticization of violence, which itself is anathema to a\r\nculture of peace, stability and human rights. Fiji is a\r\nvictim of terrorism impacting on our body politic and\r\nundermining our nation-building in the last two\r\ndecades. Not surprisingly, terrorism has defied attempts\r\nat its definition.\r\nResolution 1373 (2001) is binding on each\r\nMember State, pursuant to Chapter VII of the United\r\nNations Charter. Notwithstanding its lack of a\r\ndefinition of terrorism or terrorist acts, the resolution\r\nobligates us to take measures individually to advance\r\nour collective fight against terrorism. Some of its\r\nseemingly far-reaching effects still need to take human\r\nrights standards into account. Advancing our global\r\nvigilance for basic human rights promotes peace and,\r\ninversely, defies terrorism.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nmoral definition of terrorism is clear to all; likewise, its\r\nlegal definition, if properly guided by ethics and logic,\r\nshould serve as leverage for, rather than impede, our\r\nelaboration. Political expediency or neutrality has no\r\nplace in this equation.\r\nTerrorism wages war against civilian people, who\r\noften are defenceless and unprepared but are\r\nspecifically protected by law, as in the case of Geneva\r\nConventions. That 75 per cent of the casualties of\r\nconflicts are civilians is a sombre signal to the\r\ninternational community of the blatant disregard of\r\naccepted norms; this is accentuated by ruthless terrorist\r\nattacks, with their tolls reaching unprecedented levels.\r\nNo brand of terrorism is ever acceptable. Our\r\nfight must be holistic and all-encompassing. We need\r\nto augment the piecemeal, sectoral and narrow-focused\r\ngoals of the past to yield lasting political, legal and\r\nideological solutions. We are on the right paths to this\r\ngoal. Each sectoral convention can be instrumental in\r\nfighting terrorism if we act now to adopt a treaty\r\ncomprehensive enough to activate every wheel or cog\r\nin this machinery, which we are making stronger every\r\nyear. States parties need to implement their treaty\r\nobligations too.\r\nIn the near future, Fiji hopes to include among the\r\ninstruments it has ratified the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings of 1997 and\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nthe International Convention for the suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism of 1999. Fiji has pursued\r\ndomestic, regional and international measures. We are\r\nalso strengthening security arrangements at all entry\r\npoints to guard against international terrorism and\r\nillicit drug-trafficking.\r\nMuch more is demanded of Member States to\r\ncounter terrorism’s growing sophistication and invasive\r\nspread. Its ready access to the impressionable minds of\r\nvulnerable people is a valuable lesson to us all. These\r\ntendencies find fertile ground in political instability,\r\noppression, poverty and economic marginalization, and\r\nare often blended with ideological fervour.\r\nWe are convinced that a critical first step in the\r\nfight against terrorism is to promote freedom,\r\ndemocracy, rule of law and respect for human rights.\r\nThis would remove opportunities for intolerance and\r\nextremism, two hotbeds of terrorist tendencies.\r\nWe draw great strength from your leadership on\r\nthis item, and from the honour bestowed on us all in\r\nthis Assembly by the moving opening statement by\r\nMayor Giuliani and the Secretary-General’s sober\r\naccount of our requisite duties and obligations.\r\nNew York City and, indeed, the United States of\r\nAmerica teach us that differences and diversity lead to\r\ncelebration, and prejudices do not; and that our\r\ndifferences strengthen us, but our prejudices weaken\r\nus. These bold yet simple words can guide our steps in\r\ntackling this increasingly complex menace, whose\r\nravages we all witnessed three weeks ago.\r\nLet me close with His Excellency the President of\r\nFiji’s remembrance of this tragedy in his opening\r\naddress to the newly convened Parliament on Monday.\r\n“International terrorism is a threat … to\r\nindividual countries and … to the peace and\r\nsecurity of the whole world. Fiji … must lend its\r\nfull support to international endeavours to combat\r\nthis scourge on humanity.”\r\nMr. Tomka (Slovakia): My country has aligned\r\nitself with the statement made by the delegate of\r\nBelgium, last Monday morning, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union and the associated countries. The\r\nimportance of the topic under consideration\r\nnevertheless warrants that some additional national\r\npoints be made.\r\nThe terrorist acts committed on 11 September\r\n2001 in the United States are crimes against humanity\r\nand an assault on the whole of mankind. The loss of\r\nthousands of innocent civilians — nationals of so many\r\ncountries — is evidence that anyone of us can be, at\r\nany time, victim of blood-thirsty individuals or groups.\r\nMy country welcomes and fully supports\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) of the Security Council adopted\r\nlast Friday. What is now required are efficient steps\r\nand speedy action that can prevent horrible terrorist\r\nattacks in new forms and intensity, including nuclear,\r\nbiological and chemical terrorism. I wish to confirm\r\nthat the Slovak Republic is determined and ready to\r\ncooperate with all peace-loving countries, under the\r\nleadership of the Security Council, in all efforts to\r\neradicate international terrorism.\r\nSlovakia has played an active role in the\r\npreparation of international instruments aimed at\r\ncoping with the threat of terrorist attacks. The Slovak\r\nRepublic is a party to 11 of the 12 international anti-\r\nterrorist conventions, as well as a party to three\r\nregional instruments on this subject. Recently, on 8\r\nDecember 2000, Slovakia ratified the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings,\r\nthe Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts\r\nagainst the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the\r\nProtocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against\r\nthe Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the\r\nContinental Shelf. Furthermore, on 26 January 2001,\r\nSlovakia signed the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Significant\r\nsteps towards its ratification have been taken and the\r\nSlovak Republic will, hopefully, ratify this Convention\r\nearly next year. All obligations arising from the\r\nexisting anti-terrorist conventions are fully\r\nimplemented in the country’s domestic legislation.\r\nLet me join all those delegates who have during\r\nour debate called upon all States to ratify and fully\r\nimplement without delay all anti-terrorist conventions.\r\nLet me add our voice in support of a speedy conclusion\r\nof the work on the comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism and the convention for the\r\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.\r\nSince we cannot exclude that the terrorists may\r\nhave access to weapons of mass destruction, let me add\r\nthat we are of the view that all international\r\nconventions banning weapons of mass destruction\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nshould be supplemented by a strict regime of\r\nverification.\r\nThis century should be one of a resolute fight\r\nagainst terrorists. In fact, they are hoste humani\r\ngeneris, enemies of all humanity, and as such should be\r\nviewed as outlaws. Their acts should be treated as\r\noffences against the law of nations, and every State can\r\nand should bring them to justice.\r\nAll the new measures to be taken in order to\r\ncombat international terrorism should allow for law\r\nenforcement organs, criminal justice institutions and\r\nintelligence and security services to effectively deal\r\nwith the most dangerous crimes of these days. We are\r\nfully aware that one country alone cannot adequately\r\nrespond to terrorist attacks. The international\r\ncommunity, all States and all nations must join together\r\nin the fight against this threat. States must foresee\r\npossible targets of terrorists, and, in order to be one\r\nstep ahead of them, they must enhance cooperation and\r\nthe exchange of relevant information.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and the\r\nestablishment of the Committee for the monitoring of\r\nthe implementation of the resolution provide a very\r\nsolid basis for decisive and united action against\r\nterrorism. When needed, we should not hesitate to use\r\nthe international legal framework for such a struggle\r\nagainst a common enemy. Recent events have proved\r\nthat major developments in law are always the result of\r\na crisis.\r\nMr. Mamba (Swaziland): I am pleased to extend\r\nto you, Sir, my delegation’s congratulations on your\r\nwell earned and well deserved election to the\r\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly. We\r\nhave no doubt that your able leadership will steer this\r\nsession to a successful conclusion.\r\nInternational terrorism is a global menace of our\r\nage. Its emergence is a major challenge facing the\r\ninternational community. Indeed, the phenomenon is\r\none of the major threats in this millennium to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn the wake of the tragic events of 11 September,\r\nthe international community is still reeling in shock\r\nover the heartless and malicious manner in which those\r\nterrifying acts, which resulted in tremendous loss of\r\nlives and destruction of property, were committed. Our\r\nhearts go out to the victims and their families. The\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Swaziland has, for its\r\npart, expressed its solidarity with the United States in\r\ncondemning the recent assault on its territory. My\r\ndelegation remains optimistic that the rule of law will\r\neventually prevail and that the perpetrators of those\r\natrocities will be brought to justice.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland shares the concerns\r\nof the international community over the alarming\r\nincrease in acts of terrorism. Acts of terrorism, by their\r\nnature and links to trafficking in narcotics and small\r\narms and to organized crime, destabilize social and\r\npolitical institutions and put economic development in\r\njeopardy. For the reason that it respects no borders,\r\nthere is clearly a need for effective international\r\ncooperation to eradicate this menace, which has\r\nemerged as the most compelling crime the world must\r\ncontend with.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration, which was adopted\r\nby our heads of State and Government on 8 September\r\n2000, gives us a firm basis to act swiftly. On that\r\noccasion our leaders resolved at the highest level to\r\ntake concerted action against international terrorism\r\nand to accede as soon as possible to all relevant\r\ninternational conventions. This they did in recognition\r\nof the need for a global response to terrorism.\r\nIn that regard, we applaud the achievements of\r\nthe Ad Hoc Committee established by General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/210, of 1996, which have led\r\nto a substantial codification of international law on\r\nterrorism. The legal instruments it has concluded\r\nundoubtedly constitute an effective accomplishment in\r\nthe sphere of international cooperation against\r\ninternational terrorism. In our view, they form part of\r\nan appropriate response to increase the effectiveness of\r\ninternational cooperation for the eradication of\r\nterrorism and thus to end the impunity terrorists have\r\nenjoyed for so long.\r\nWe also hope that with the elaboration of a\r\ncomprehensive international convention against\r\nterrorism — thanks to a draft proposal by the\r\nGovernment of India — a truly integrated and holistic\r\napproach to international terrorism will be in place, and\r\nthat it will ensure more added value to the current\r\nsectoral legal instruments already in force.\r\nI must hasten to point out here that, without\r\nprejudice to the right of States to defend themselves,\r\nthere is a need to strengthen and enhance the role of\r\nour Organization as an indispensable instrument for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, and for\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nmobilizing the people of the world against new,\r\nunprecedented threats. And, as stated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in presenting his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, it is only the United Nations that\r\n“can give global legitimacy to the long-term\r\nstruggle against terrorism.” (A/56/PV.7)\r\nA week later he told the Assembly:\r\n“Terrorism will be defeated if the international\r\ncommunity [unites] in a broad coalition, or it will\r\nnot be defeated at all.” (A/56/PV.12)\r\nThere is much that we can do to help prevent\r\nfuture atrocities. In that spirit, we welcome Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), which lays down the\r\nblueprint Member States must adhere to if we are to\r\nsucceed in our collective endeavour to fight terrorism.\r\nThere could be no better opportunity than now to\r\naddress the question of convening a high-level\r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations to\r\nformulate a joint organized response by the\r\ninternational community to terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations. In that regard, we reiterate the call\r\nby the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement — held in Durban, South Africa, in 1998 —\r\nfor the convening of such a conference, which would\r\nserve to facilitate consensus among States on measures\r\nto combat terrorism, as well as to encourage a climate\r\nof confidence and cooperation. We are confident that,\r\nwith the collective wisdom of all its members, the\r\nUnited Nations will achieve its goals and will prevail.\r\nMr. Djangoné-Bi (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I begin by expressing to you, Mr. President,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire’s pleasure at your presiding over the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Allow me\r\nalso to say how pleased I am that you are guiding our\r\nwork as I address the Assembly for the first time. At\r\nthis solemn time, I assure you of my delegation’s\r\nreadiness to cooperate fully with you.\r\nI also extend Côte d’Ivoire’s warm\r\ncongratulations to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\non the superb way in which he discharged his difficult\r\ntasks, and its fraternal congratulations to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan on his reappointment to head the\r\nUnited Nations. His outstanding work since his initial\r\nappointment presaged such a development in his\r\nbrilliant career. We offer him our best wishes for\r\nsuccess.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe opening of the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly coincided with an unforgettable\r\ntragedy for both Americans and the entire world. A\r\nterrorist organization hijacked four American planes on\r\ndomestic flights in order to commit four fatal attacks,\r\nwhose victims number in the thousands. Côte d’Ivoire\r\ncondemns in the firmest and most categorical manner\r\nthose acts of terrorism, which no human reasoning can\r\njustify. The Government and people of Côte d’Ivoire\r\npay respectful tribute to the memory of the victims,\r\nwho were of a number of nationalities.\r\nAs President Laurent Gbagbo has done, we\r\nreiterate our sincere condolences to the courageous\r\nAmerican people, the authorities of the host country\r\nand the bereaved families. We also extend our\r\ncondolences to all the other countries that have been\r\nplunged into mourning by this appalling tragedy. We\r\nsalute the courage, bravery and patriotism of the rescue\r\nteams — the fire-fighters, police officers and\r\nvolunteers from civil society — who, at the risk of\r\ntheir own lives, managed to extricate from the\r\nwreckage some of the victims who survived.\r\nWe are convinced that the proud and brave\r\nAmerican people, who are accustomed to great\r\nchallenges and to adversity, will not let themselves be\r\ndefeated by this difficult ordeal. Americans are already\r\ndemonstrating to the world that in the face of adversity\r\nthere is a need to remain united and strong and to\r\nsilence partisan squabbling — an outstanding lesson in\r\npatriotism. I assure them that they will not lack the\r\nsupport and solidarity of Côte d’Ivoire in their just\r\nstruggle against the true perpetrators and sponsors of\r\nthese cowardly attacks.\r\nIn that regard, my country firmly supports\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), adopted\r\npromptly and unanimously on Friday, 28 September. If\r\nvigorously applied, this resolution will be an effective\r\nweapon in the international community’s war on\r\nterrorism. Côte d’Ivoire also supports the proposal to\r\nconvene a high-level conference under United Nations\r\nauspices to draft a concerted and adequate response to\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nThe 11 September terrorist attacks shocked and,\r\nindeed, traumatized the entire world. They also raised a\r\nplethora of questions. Questions have even arisen about\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the management of\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nserious crises. To be sure, since 1963 the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism has been the subject of many\r\nconventions, resolutions and other international legal\r\ninstruments adopted in the United Nations and in other\r\ninternational bodies. Unfortunately, there has been no\r\nconsensus whatsoever on the definition of the word\r\n“terrorism”. How can the international community\r\neffectively combat an evil if the members of that\r\ncommunity differ about the nature of that evil?\r\nBeyond the legal, military and other measures\r\nneeded to completely eradicate terrorism, we need to\r\nconsider the root causes of this modern-day scourge so\r\nglaringly illustrated in the bloody attacks of\r\n11 September. In that connection, those attacks demand\r\nour attention. What can cause human beings to turn\r\nthemselves into living bombs and to end their own\r\nlives — along, above all, with those of thousands of\r\nother, innocent, people? We must raise questions here\r\nin this universal Organization, whose Charter refers in\r\nits very first lines to the determination of the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations to\r\n“save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar, which twice in our lifetime has brought\r\nuntold sorrow to mankind, and\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human\r\nrights, in the dignity and worth of the human\r\nperson, in the equal rights of men and women and\r\nof nations large and small, and\r\n“to establish conditions under which justice\r\nand respect for the obligations arising from\r\ntreaties and other sources of international law can\r\nbe maintained, and\r\n“to promote social progress and better\r\nstandards of life in larger freedom,\r\n“and for these ends\r\n“to practise tolerance and live together in\r\npeace with one another as good neighbours, and\r\n“to unite our strength to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, and\r\n“to ensure, by the acceptance of principles\r\nand the institution of methods, that armed force\r\nshall not be used, save in the common interest,\r\nand\r\n“to employ international machinery for the\r\npromotion of the economic and social\r\nadvancement of all peoples.”\r\nAt a time when we are here, following the\r\ndisastrous events of 11 September 2001, to reflect on\r\nmeasures to combat international terrorism, there is\r\ngood reason to ask whether resolutions – as fine as they\r\nmay be – have always been respected. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration begins,\r\n“We, heads of State and Government, have\r\ngathered at United Nations Headquarters in New\r\nYork from 6 to 8 September 2000, at the dawn of\r\na new millennium, to reaffirm our faith in the\r\nOrganization and its Charter as indispensable\r\nfoundations of a more peaceful, prosperous and\r\njust world.” (resolution 55/2, para. 1)\r\nIt is wrong for our Organization to continue to\r\ntolerate the obvious lack of democracy in some regions\r\nwhile it fails to encourage Governments in other\r\nregions which are making a meaningful effort to\r\ndemocratize their countries. As we all know, a lack of\r\ndemocracy spawns injustice, frustration and, naturally,\r\npoor governance. While respecting the sovereignty of\r\nits Member States, the Organization must work\r\nimpartially to ensure the universality of its great\r\nprinciples. Here too, the primacy of international law\r\nmust be institutionalized everywhere in the world.\r\nSince its creation, the United Nations has\r\nencouraged the codification and progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law, in a process that has\r\nexceeded the expectations of the founders.\r\nInternational law, which is respected by nearly all\r\nnations in nearly all circumstances, is critical to\r\npeaceful relations and to cooperation. Unfortunately,\r\ninternational law stands powerless today to advance\r\nand champion moral values and exemplary behaviour.\r\nHere again, the Organization must remain vigilant in\r\norder to bring offenders to justice and, if possible, to\r\npunish them firmly and in a just and equitable manner.\r\nThere can be no genuine, human globalization\r\nwithout a recognition that solidarity is a prerequisite\r\nduty. The Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\r\nstated that solutions will be found only if global\r\nquestions are addressed comprehensively through\r\nbetter cooperation, closer alliances, greater\r\ncommitment and renewed solidarity. Solidarity must\r\ntherefore be viewed as an important ideal. A genuine\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nsense of solidarity can also contribute to resolving the\r\nfundamental question of international terrorism.\r\nIn truth, the solutions to all the international\r\ncommunity’s problems are to be found in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, which advocates peace, justice and\r\nsolidarity. The only obstacle is the inability of Member\r\nStates to work together in solidarity and to implement\r\nfully the noble ideals of the Organization. Let us not\r\nforget that the real power of the United Nations to take\r\naction and to meet all these challenges lies in the\r\nwillingness of Member States to recognize, accept and\r\nenhance that power through solidarity. That is how we\r\ncan eradicate the evil of international terrorism, whose\r\nperpetrators are from all countries, races and religions.\r\nMr. Šerkšnys (Lithuania): First of all, I would\r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election\r\nas President of the General Assembly. I wish him all\r\nsuccess in his honourable and very responsible\r\nmission.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September in the United\r\nStates, caused by unprecedented terrorist attacks in the\r\ncities of New York and Washington, D.C., affected the\r\nlives of many people and unexpectedly changed our\r\nplans and our goals. Those events added to the sad list\r\nof the black days of history on which we have\r\nwitnessed the loss of many innocent lives. Allow me,\r\non behalf of the Lithuanian Government and the people\r\nof Lithuania, to present my sincere condolences to the\r\nrepresentative of the United States of America and to\r\nthose affected by this human tragedy. The Lithuanian\r\npeople share the sadness and the pain of those who\r\nhave suffered as a result of the deadly terrorist attacks.\r\nLithuania strongly condemns the terrorist action\r\nagainst the United States and expresses its solidarity\r\nand support, both political and practical, to the United\r\nStates as well as its determination to stand alongside\r\nthe international community in its fight against\r\nterrorism.\r\nLithuania values highly and is participating in the\r\ncollective work of the United Nations in the context of\r\nits complex action against terrorism. Our Organization\r\nhas at its disposal the necessary political and legal\r\nremedies effectively to respond to those who are\r\nengaged in terrorist activities. The adoption of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1368 (2001) the day after the\r\ntragedies that took place in New York, Washington,\r\nD.C. and Pennsylvania demonstrated the ability of our\r\nOrganization to act operatively and effectively. We also\r\nwelcome the recent adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which provides strong and\r\neffective tools for preventing international terrorism.\r\nLithuania also attaches great importance to the\r\nrole of other international forums on anti-terrorist\r\nissues. My country supports the statements made by the\r\nNorth Atlantic Council and the decision to apply the\r\nWashington Treaty as regards the terrorist attacks\r\nagainst the United States. I should like to note that the\r\nLithuanian Government has decided to grant a\r\npermanent diplomatic clearance for the overflight and\r\nlanding of United States Government aircraft.\r\nThe Lithuanian Government has aligned itself\r\nwith the conclusions and plan of action of the Council\r\nof the European Union of 21 September. My delegation\r\nalso aligns itself with the statement made by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Belgium to the United\r\nNations on behalf of the European Union. Lithuania\r\nfully supports the European Union calls for the\r\nbroadest possible global coalition against terrorism\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations.\r\nLithuania reiterates its position that the combat\r\nagainst terrorism is one of the most important areas in\r\nwhich closer political and practical cooperation\r\nbetween international organizations is necessary.\r\nLithuania also will reassess its relations with\r\ncertain countries in the light of the support which those\r\ncountries might give to terrorism.\r\nLithuania also is strongly committed to take the\r\nnecessary individual internal measures. Additional\r\ndomestic legal acts and amendments to existing\r\nregulations relating to the suppression of terrorism, as\r\nwell as security measures and measures on other\r\nrelated issues, have been initiated. Lithuania currently\r\nis working on a national action programme on\r\ncombating terrorism and intensifying trilateral Baltic\r\ncooperation on developing joint measures in this\r\nrespect.\r\nLithuania, which is already a State party to a\r\nnumber of United Nations and other international\r\ninstruments, is now speeding up the necessary\r\nprocedures to accede to other relevant multilateral\r\nagreements, namely the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the\r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of\r\nCrimes against Internationally Protected Persons,\r\nincluding Diplomatic agents, and others. Lithuania is\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nalso expecting the finalization and adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of two new important multilateral\r\ninstruments: the convention for the suppression of acts\r\nof nuclear terrorism and the comprehensive convention\r\non international terrorism.\r\nLithuania will strengthen control of the import,\r\ntransit and export of strategic goods and technologies.\r\nEfforts directed towards the prevention of proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction and related materials\r\nand technologies as well as illicit trafficking in small\r\narms and light weapons will be reinforced.\r\nAllow me to come back briefly to what I said\r\nconcerning the need for practical and political\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations. As has been repeatedly\r\npointed out, there are 12 basic United Nations\r\nmultilateral instruments directly designed to suppress\r\nterrorism. Indeed, it is a legal basis of a universal\r\nnature. But international legality provides for a much\r\nbroader set of relevant international instruments. For\r\nexample, the Council of Europe has successfully\r\nelaborated a number of treaties, such as the European\r\nConvention on the Suppression of Terrorism, the\r\nEuropean Convention on Extradition and its protocols,\r\nand so on. I think that there are sufficient grounds for\r\nan exchange of experiences and good practices between\r\nour Organization and the Council of Europe. Let me\r\nadd that these documents of the European treaty system\r\nare open not only to the member States of the Council\r\nof Europe but to others.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to say that I believe\r\nthat the proper combination of domestic efforts and\r\ninternational remedies directed against terrorism will\r\nlead us to success in preventing it.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): My\r\ncountry, Senegal, and its people, through the President\r\nof the Republic, Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, have\r\nunanimously — regardless of political, sociological or\r\nreligious views — strongly and vigorously condemned\r\nthe terrorist attacks perpetrated against the United\r\nStates of America on 11 September last.\r\nIn paying tribute to the undying memory of the\r\nthousands of innocent victims who were brutally taken\r\naway from their loved ones, I should like convey once\r\nagain our deepest condolences, our heartfelt\r\ncompassion and our unfailing solidarity to the bereaved\r\nfamilies, to the brave people and the Government of\r\nthe United States of America, and to all of the other\r\ncountries — almost half of the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations — that have been plunged into\r\nmourning by this unspeakable tragedy.\r\nThe unprecedented, indiscriminate and heinous\r\nviolence of the attacks, their devastating effects in\r\nterms of human life and physical property and their\r\npremeditated and carefully planned nature deeply\r\nwounded, distressed and outraged the community of\r\npeoples of the United Nations.\r\nWhether perpetrated by individuals, States or\r\nnon-State groups, terrorism can never go unpunished.\r\nActs of terrorism can never be excused — much less\r\naccorded legitimacy — regardless of where they occur,\r\nthe motives behind them or the circumstances\r\nsurrounding them, and regardless of the identity of\r\ntheir masterminds, perpetrators or victims or their\r\npolitical beliefs, sociocultural heritage or creed.\r\nMy delegation is gratified at the strong sense of\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly and at the remarkable speed with which they\r\naddressed this threat to humankind, its security and its\r\nfuture by condemning unanimously and with the\r\nutmost vigour these barbaric acts, which are totally\r\nbeyond the pale in terms of ethics, religion and\r\ncommon sense.\r\nAbove and beyond a formal condemnation, we\r\nmust react vigorously, strongly and concretely and take\r\naction that sends a clear message before our painful\r\nmemories can fade as a result of the passage of time,\r\nour preoccupation with our everyday problems or a\r\nrealpolitik that nothing, absolutely nothing, could\r\nwarrant or justify.\r\nThat is the deeper meaning of the initiative taken\r\nby the President of the Republic of Senegal, Mr.\r\nAbdoulaye Wade, who, the day after the tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember and hence before the adoption by the\r\nSecurity Council of resolution 1373 (2001), proposed\r\nthe idea of an African covenant against terrorism.\r\nAllow me here to quote the head of State of Senegal,\r\nwho said:\r\n“The African countries have individually\r\ncondemned the terrorist acts committed against\r\nthe United States on 11 September and expressed\r\ntheir solidarity with the American people. A\r\nglobal coalition against terrorism is being put\r\ntogether. The European countries are joining it,\r\nindividually and, above all, in an organized front\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nin the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization. I have felt that the African\r\ncountries in turn should be involved, above and\r\nbeyond a simple verbal declaration, through\r\ndirect action in a global struggle. The reasons for\r\nthis are, above all, our rejection of violence and\r\nour condemnation of terrorism, which threatens\r\nall States, including ours, directly or indirectly.\r\nIndeed, while the direct threat is clear, there is an\r\nindirect and real threat if an African State is\r\ninvolved in terrorist actions against another\r\ncountry. If reprisals are taken, they threaten our\r\ncontinent.”\r\nCombining deeds with words, as is his wont, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal contacted the\r\nHead of State of Zambia, Mr. Frederick Chiluba, the\r\ncurrent Chairman of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU), to discuss a proposal aimed at concluding an\r\nagreement among African States in the form of an\r\nAfrican covenant against terrorism with the\r\nestablishment of a commission of heads of State.\r\nIn substance and by way of example, President\r\nWade suggested — prior to the Security Council’s\r\nmeeting — a certain number of measures that the\r\ncommission could set forth, to be articulated around\r\nthe following issues, which are open to amendment and\r\nelaboration: cooperation and coordination with other\r\nanti-terrorist coalitions throughout the world; the\r\ncommitment of every African State to reject and to\r\nrefrain from participating, in any form whatsoever, in\r\nterrorist activities and actions; the commitment of\r\nevery African State not to finance the activities or\r\nactions of terrorist groups; the commitment of every\r\nAfrican State to refuse access to its territory to any\r\nindividuals or groups with terrorist intentions; and the\r\ncommitment of every African State to agree to all\r\nAfrican or international inspections if there are signs\r\nthat terrorist actions are in preparation.\r\nThis African covenant, which should be set under\r\nway at the meeting in Dakar this month, would be a\r\nuseful complement to the OAU Convention on the\r\nPrevention and Combating of Terrorism, adopted in\r\nAlgiers in July 1999 at the initiative of Algeria and\r\nwith the support of Senegal, a member of the Group of\r\nFive specially mandated by the central organ of the\r\nOAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\r\nand Resolution. At the same time, it should be noted in\r\norder to stress the initiative’s timeliness and scope that\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, of which\r\nSenegal is also a member, has also adopted several\r\nresolutions and, above all, a Convention on Combating\r\nInternational Terrorism.\r\nFor its part, the Non-Aligned Movement, at its\r\nministerial meeting in April 2000, launched the idea of\r\nan international summit conference on terrorism, under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations. The convening of\r\nthat conference would be an appropriate response to\r\nthe wish of the Security Council, which, in its\r\nresolutions 1269 (1999) and 1373 (2001), emphasized\r\nthe absolute need to intensify the struggle against\r\nterrorism and to enhance international cooperation in\r\nthis key area on the basis of the principles of the\r\nCharter and the norms of international law.\r\nThis universal cooperation is all the more\r\nunavoidable now that it is clear that no State alone can\r\nwin the war against the shadowy multinational\r\ncriminals of terrorism. This fight requires the building\r\nof a global coalition based on regional or subregional\r\narrangements that already exist or have yet to be\r\ncreated, following the models of the excellent\r\nEuropean initiatives and the draft African covenant\r\nproposed by Senegal.\r\nThis world coalition has today become a\r\ncategorical imperative, because the nature, methods,\r\nforms and manifestations of terrorist activities have\r\nchanged and been refined in unsuspected ways. I refer\r\nin this regard to chemical, bacteriological, nuclear and\r\nother forms of terrorism, the terrifying dangers of\r\nwhich, far from being a distant or theoretical prospect,\r\ndeserve to be seriously taken into account in order to\r\nspare mankind the apocalypse of a collective disaster.\r\nSenegal energetically supports the inspired appeal\r\nof our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, in his\r\nreport, has urged Member States to adhere to the 12\r\nconventions and protocols on international terrorism,\r\nprepared and adopted under United Nations auspices.\r\nAmong these legal instruments are the important\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings and the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the\r\nentry into force of which must be accelerated.\r\nThe stakes in this battle require us as soon as\r\npossible to set aside our usual, if not to say scholastic,\r\ndisputes on the definition of the very concept of\r\nterrorism. Moreover, while the discussions in the\r\nCommission on Human Rights and other relevant\r\nforums may be very interesting and rich, the\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nmalevolent octopus of terrorism and its destructive\r\ntentacles are, unfortunately, an extremely visible and\r\ntragically palpable, hideous reality.\r\nAn international consensus must urgently be\r\nestablished on the basis of Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) in order to give shape to our common\r\nstruggle. Senegal strongly encourages the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee on international terrorism created by the\r\nGeneral Assembly to do all it can to conclude its work\r\nand to complete the elaboration of the draft convention.\r\nOn the basis of the relevant resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council, in particular resolutions 1368 (2001)\r\nof 12 September and 1373 (2001) of 28 September, my\r\ncountry has no doubt whatsoever that all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations fraternity will, without\r\nexception, undertake the resolute commitment to\r\nrefrain from any act aimed at organizing, encouraging,\r\nsupporting, financing or committing terrorist acts.\r\nSenegal has no doubt that all Member States will\r\nensure that their territory is not used for terrorism\r\npurposes or serve as a sanctuary for the professionals\r\nand militants of terrorism. Senegal has no doubt that all\r\nMember States will take the necessary measures to\r\npromote an exchange of information on terrorist\r\ngroups, movements and organizations with a view to\r\npreventing the establishment, development and spread\r\nof networks that support terrorism.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like, as others have,\r\nto stress the vital need for the international community\r\nto address with equal and fervent determination the\r\ninherent causes of terrorism and the means of\r\nstemming the scourges of poverty, exclusion and\r\nalienation — flagrant injustices that are the fertile\r\nground in which all frustrations, despair and\r\nexasperation thrive.\r\nI wish, lastly, to reiterate our firm conviction that\r\nthe struggle against terrorism is one without quarter for\r\nthe safeguarding of freedoms and the promotion of\r\nhuman rights. It is a daily struggle for democracy and\r\nthe rule of law, a fight without concession for civil\r\npeace, the survival of humankind and the triumph of\r\nthe lofty values that we all share. It is an implacable\r\nwar against transnational organized crime that can in\r\nno way brook vain attempts to cobble together\r\ninsidious philosophies or sterile temptations to erect\r\nartificial barriers between nations and cultures,\r\nspirituality and civilizations.\r\nHumankind is, indeed, passing through a crucial\r\nstage in the human journey and is pondering its destiny.\r\nIt stands at a crossroads; it can either embrace life or\r\nside with those who deal in death. For its part, Senegal,\r\ntogether with the overwhelming majority of human\r\nbeings, has chosen life and hope.\r\nMay we all, together, combine our willpower,\r\nunite our efforts and build the consensus and synergy\r\nthat we need so that the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council can continue to speak out loudly,\r\nclearly and with one voice for the only cause that\r\nmatters in the face of the rise of extremism. We must\r\nconsider anew the worsening state of human poverty\r\nand distress so as to ensure the survival of humankind\r\nand the triumph of the human being through the\r\nbuilding of a global covenant. That is the only way to\r\nprevail over international terrorism.\r\nMr. Balzan (Malta): Earlier this week the\r\nrepresentative of Belgium delivered a statement on\r\nbehalf of the European Union and associated countries,\r\nincluding Malta. While endorsing the substance of his\r\nstatement in its entirety, I should like to make a number\r\nof comments from Malta’s own perspective.\r\nWhile terrorism has raised its ugly head countless\r\ntimes in countless places, never has a single\r\nmanifestation of this cowardly and cold-blooded\r\nbehaviour sent such waves of panic and fear across the\r\nentire world. In our globalized and connected world,\r\nviewers thousands of miles away shared through their\r\ntelevision screens the same sense of horror and\r\nrevulsion that the heinous events of 11 September\r\ncreated in all of us here in the host city of the United\r\nNations. On the very day that this General Assembly\r\nwas to begin consideration of the items on its agenda,\r\nmany of which are of great import and urgency, the\r\nreality of the threat of global terrorism on an\r\nunprecedented scale imposed itself at the top of the\r\norder of the day.\r\nBut terrorism is not new to the agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations. In recent days, the ongoing discussions\r\non how best to deal with terrorism at the international\r\nlevel have been overtaken by the sheer monstrosity of\r\nthe tragedy that has moved us all. Its resolve bolstered\r\nby these recent events, on 28 September the Security\r\nCouncil took dramatic and far-reaching action aimed at\r\nstrengthening international cooperation in the exchange\r\nof information relating to terrorism and the stifling of\r\nfinancial flows that underpin it. Drawing largely on\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nexisting discussions within the United Nations, the\r\nCouncil brought many of the proposals and\r\nprescriptions directly into the realm of international\r\nlaw, with immediate and universal effect. The fact that\r\nsuch measures aimed at the undermining of the scourge\r\nof terrorism have taken on the strength of law is\r\ncertainly welcome.\r\nThe new measures on the exchange of operational\r\ninformation on terrorism, together with new measures\r\naimed at cutting off the financial lifeline of large-scale\r\nterrorist operations, when implemented as single,\r\nconstituent links in a larger chain of strategies and\r\nmechanisms, will be able seriously to impair terrorists’\r\nability to act.\r\nThe Government of Malta is fully committed to\r\nthe efforts of the international community aimed at the\r\neradication of terrorism and the swift and\r\ncomprehensive implementation of the measures\r\nprovided for in Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001). Malta was among the very first countries to\r\nsign the International Convention for the Suppression\r\nof the Financing of Terrorism when it opened for\r\nsignature on 10 January 2000. It prides itself on its\r\nstrong record of fighting financial crime, and works\r\nclosely on the issue with the Organisation for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development and within\r\nthe Council of Europe and the Commonwealth.\r\nThe Maltese Government has already embarked\r\non an intensive investigation, working together with\r\nthe national financial and regulatory bodies, to seek out\r\nany links between suspect organizations and\r\ntransactions through local financial institutions. While\r\nthe search has so far proved negative, full diligence and\r\nscrutiny continue to be exercised.\r\nThe Government of Malta stands four-square\r\nbehind the international community in its efforts to\r\ndeny terrorists the means to repeat the dastardly acts of\r\n11 September. Out of the debris of those events, a new\r\nsense of common purpose has been born within the\r\ninternational community. Countries have been swift in\r\ntheir recognition of common interests and share a\r\ncommon determination to rid the world of the scourge\r\nof terrorism. The remarkable expression of political\r\nwill and decisive action that has been witnessed in the\r\nlast three weeks inspires real hope that multilateral\r\nefforts to root out the terrible growth of terrorism can\r\nmake significant in-roads.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to declare my\r\nGovernment’s firm commitment to stand with the\r\ninternational community in this struggle every step of\r\nthe way.\r\nMr. Niculescu (Romania): Romania associates\r\nitself with the statement made by the representation of\r\nBelgium on behalf of the European Union, and fully\r\nshares its important and constructive political message.\r\nI would like to make some additional comments from a\r\nnational perspective.\r\nThree weeks ago, on 11 September, something\r\nunthinkable happened. The barbaric attacks against the\r\nUnited States have shocked people all over the world.\r\nWe all witnessed with horror a villainous attack against\r\nfreedom, peace and humanity. Over 7,000 innocent\r\ncivilians from more than 80 nations, including\r\nRomania, were murdered. Romania shares the profound\r\ngrief caused by these atrocities. We once again express\r\nour heartfelt and deepest sympathy to all the victims\r\nand their families, to the Government of the United\r\nStates and to the American people.\r\nIn full solidarity with the Government of the\r\nUnited States, on 19 September Romania’s Parliament,\r\ntaking note of the decision of the North Atlantic\r\nCouncil to implement article 5 of the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty, passed a resolution aimed at providing the\r\nfacilities of the national sea, land and air space in order\r\nto support a possible response action against terrorism\r\nand at coordinating Romania’s actions with the United\r\nStates of America and NATO and with their partners\r\nand allies in order to put at their disposal available\r\nforces and means in keeping with the proposed actions.\r\nWe take part in this important debate with a deep\r\nsense of responsibility and urgency. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral said in his introductory remarks at the 12th\r\nmeeting, “We are in a moral struggle to fight an evil\r\nthat is anathema to all faiths.” There must be no\r\npolitical or religious justification for terrorist violence,\r\nand no people or religion should be blamed for acts of\r\nmindless individuals. Unity and not division of\r\nhumanity is the right response to this common enemy,\r\nwhich knows no national borders and can target any of\r\nour societies. Terrorism must be universally\r\ncondemned and fought on a global front. The\r\ninternational community must act in a united way, on\r\nthe basis of our shared values, in building a universal\r\ncoalition and defining a global, legitimate, long-term\r\nstrategy to fight terrorism.\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nThe actions already taken by the United Nations\r\nin the past weeks — Security Council resolutions 1368\r\n(2001) and 1373 (2001) and General Assembly\r\nresolution 56/1 — not only unequivocally condemn the\r\nattacks, identifying them as a threat to international\r\npeace and security and underlining the right to\r\ncollective and individual self-defence under the\r\nCharter, but also set a clear agenda before Member\r\nStates.\r\nWe are required to take the necessary steps within\r\nour own systems to prevent the commission of terrorist\r\nacts, including by provision of early warning; to deny\r\nfinancing, support and safe haven to terrorists; to work\r\ntogether to share information and protect against\r\nterrorist acts; and to become parties without delay to\r\nthe 12 conventions and protocols on international\r\nterrorism adopted under United Nations auspices.\r\nRomania is party to 10 of these universal\r\ninstruments and to the European Convention on the\r\nSuppression of Terrorism. It has signed the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings and the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, of\r\n1999. The process of ratification of these two\r\nconventions is to be completed soon.\r\nWe fully share the widespread opinion that we\r\nshould speed up the efforts to conclude and adopt a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nWe are prepared to take an active part in building an\r\nagreement on the outstanding issues, including the\r\nquestion of the definition of terrorism.\r\nThe fight against the scourge of terrorism calls\r\nupon the Member States to cooperate at both the\r\nregional and international levels. As far as Romania is\r\nconcerned, let me first mention the contribution by the\r\nChairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Romanian\r\nForeign Minister, who, at a recent special session of the\r\nOSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, called on all 55\r\nparticipating States to use their regional connections\r\nand bring a valuable contribution by sharing\r\ninformation and expertise related to terrorist or any\r\nother criminal activities, to strengthen their legislation,\r\nincluding provisions for a European-wide mandate for\r\ndetention and extradition of suspects and to take action\r\nto identify and clamp down on sources of financing of\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn particular, suggestions were made that all the\r\nOSCE missions be mandated to increase their border\r\nmonitoring and policing, and border surveillance and\r\nsecurity in vulnerable regions, and to identify needs\r\nand channel assistance on standardizing counter-\r\nterrorism legislation and counter-terrorism training,\r\nwhile OSCE might explore the potential for expanding\r\ntraining programmes to include counter-terrorism\r\ntraining compatible with human rights.\r\nThe Chairman-in-Office has also proposed the\r\nsetting up of a working group on the OSCE’s role in\r\ncombating terrorism, with the participation of a\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations Office for Drug\r\nControl and Crime Prevention.\r\nSecondly, I would like to mention that the\r\nnational annual plan of Romania’s preparation for\r\nadherence to NATO for 2001-2002, approved by the\r\nGovernment only few days ago, includes a chapter with\r\nspecial measures, to be implemented at the national\r\nlevel, aimed at facilitating regional cooperation to\r\ncombat terrorism. These include the amending of\r\nnational legislation; the ratification of the previously\r\nmentioned anti-terrorism conventions and of the\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime;\r\nand full utilization of the mechanisms, capabilities and\r\nexpertise of the South European Cooperative Initiative\r\nCentre for Combating Trans-Border Crime based in\r\nBucharest.\r\nMiss Ramoutar (Trinidad and Tobago): The\r\nfollowing statement is delivered on behalf of His\r\nExcellency Mr. George W. McKenzie, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago\r\nto the United Nations.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Trinidad and\r\nTobago shares the deep sense of shock and grief\r\nexperienced by the Government and people of the\r\nUnited States at the attacks on the City of New York\r\nand Washington, D.C., on 11 September 2001. We\r\nextend our deepest sympathies to the victims and their\r\nfamilies, and our condolences to all countries that lost\r\nnationals in these barbaric attacks. Trinidad and\r\nTobago has also suffered losses.\r\nOn 12 September 2001, the Government of\r\nTrinidad and Tobago reaffirmed its solidarity with and\r\nsupport for the Government and people of the United\r\nStates and declared our unreserved commitment to\r\nassist the American people wherever we can. The\r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago also conveyed to\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nthe United States the assurance of our continued\r\nsupport in global efforts to combat the scourge of\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago strongly condemns terrorism\r\nin all its forms and manifestations and reiterates that no\r\nmotive could ever justify terrorist acts. The attacks of\r\n11 September now pose a challenge to the international\r\ncommunity as a whole and demand a strong\r\ninternational response.\r\nAs events unfold, it has become clearer to us that\r\nall our countries are susceptible to terrorism in one\r\nform or another. For this reason we, the international\r\ncommunity, must solidify our efforts to eradicate this\r\nevil from our world. It is incumbent upon us to put in\r\nplace effective measures to strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween States in order to ensure the punishment of the\r\nperpetrators of acts of terrorism and those who support\r\nthem. This international effort requires commitment\r\nand solidarity, and we are encouraged by the support of\r\nthe international community towards global efforts to\r\neradicate terrorism on all fronts.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago continues to support the\r\nongoing efforts of the United Nations in respect of the\r\nquestion of terrorism. We view the adoption of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), as\r\nwell as General Assembly resolution 56/1, as positive\r\nsteps made by this Organization towards advancing the\r\ninternational effort to eradicate terrorism.\r\nWe will participate in the efforts under way in the\r\nSixth Committee of the General Assembly to conclude\r\nthe negotiation of a comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism. In furtherance of our stance against\r\nterrorism, Trinidad and Tobago acceded to the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings in April of this year, and we will\r\nundertake similar efforts in respect of other relevant\r\ntreaties, especially in the light of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001).\r\nTrinidad and Tobago has always opposed\r\ntransnational criminal activities, and only last week we\r\nsigned the United Nations Convention against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to\r\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,\r\nEspecially Women and Children and the Protocol\r\nagainst the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and\r\nAir. We are aware of the need for constant vigilance,\r\ngiven the linkages between terrorism and transnational\r\norganized crime, which take many forms, including the\r\nillicit traffic in drugs, the illicit trade in weapons,\r\nespecially small arms and light weapons, and money-\r\nlaundering. These manifestations of terrorism lead to\r\nthe destabilization of the world economy and also\r\nheighten the negative impact on the economies of\r\ndeveloping States like ours.\r\nIt is time for us, the Member States of the United\r\nNations, to redouble our efforts towards achieving the\r\ngoal of freeing our world of the scourge of terrorism.\r\nWhat is now required is a consolidated and\r\ncomprehensive approach to this multifaceted problem.\r\nIt is incumbent upon us, the international community,\r\nto stand together in the face of the challenge posed to\r\nall of us by the recent terrorist attacks. The time has\r\ncome for us to act immediately to ensure that all our\r\npeoples live in an environment of freedom and\r\ndemocracy. Our citizens must be able to carry out their\r\nnormal daily activities free from fear. At the dawn of\r\nthe third millennium, if we fail to act decisively, the\r\nconsequences for humanity will be indeed grave.\r\nMr. Seixas da Costa (Portugal): On behalf of the\r\nPortuguese Government, although I have said it before,\r\nI must reiterate now how deeply we feel as a result of\r\nthe tragic circumstances we are living through. It is\r\ntime to try to use the opportunity of this debate to\r\nreflect further on our common commitment to work\r\ntowards restoring peace and stability to the\r\ninternational scene.\r\nIn the last few weeks, we have witnessed a\r\nunique movement of solidarity by the international\r\ncommunity towards the United States. That country,\r\nthe host country of the United Nations, was subjected\r\nto vile provocation and aggression, deeply felt by its\r\nGovernment and people. The brutal terrorist attacks\r\nthat killed thousands of innocent people — citizens\r\nfrom many countries, including my own — shocked the\r\ninternational community and created an unprecedented\r\nwave of repulsion. The expression of common grief\r\nwith the American people took on tones never seen\r\nbefore, and the global political reaction could not have\r\nbeen more resolute.\r\nThe Government of my country made clear, from\r\nthe very first instant, its firm position. We openly share\r\nthe resolve of the United States to launch and sustain\r\nan international campaign, through various means and\r\nusing various tools, to bring to justice those responsible\r\nfor these criminal acts and to engage the international\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\ncommunity in a concerted effort to avoid their\r\nrepetition in the future.\r\nWe have acted on several fronts, from the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization to the European Union,\r\nfrom bilateral cooperation to the work of this General\r\nAssembly. We have acted without ambiguity, siding\r\nwith those who have called for concrete measures to\r\npunish the criminals, and declaring that we do not\r\naccept their impunity, nor will we tolerate it.\r\nI call the Assembly’s attention, in particular, to\r\nthe political and practical response of the European\r\nUnion in facing this crisis, to which its Presidency has\r\nalready referred in a statement presented earlier in this\r\ndebate on behalf of all member States of the Union.\r\nThe expression of solidarity with the United\r\nStates was not only evident in bilateral terms. The\r\nAmerican people were also given the clearest\r\ndemonstration of solidarity from this Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations. Two important resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council and one of the General Assembly\r\nwere adopted by an inspiring unanimity, and the\r\nSecretary-General made clear the commitment of the\r\nOrganization to remain at the forefront of the struggle\r\nagainst international terrorism.\r\nThis is a moment for action but, simultaneously,\r\nit is also a moment for reflection. This reflection must\r\ninvolve all areas of work of this Organization,\r\nexploiting all possible fields of activity that may\r\ncontribute to tackling this problem, through direct or\r\nindirect means. We need to be open-minded in looking\r\nat the political, economic, social and ethnic\r\nbackground of this problem. We must not hide behind\r\nsimplistic solutions to complex problems. We must see\r\nnot only the trees but also the forest.\r\nWe refuse to be single-minded in focusing on\r\nwhat must be done. Some may say there are priorities\r\nto be followed and that we should concentrate on the\r\nmost urgent ones. In our opinion, the only real priority\r\nis to solve the entire problem and, with that aim, we\r\nmust be prepared to act simultaneously in all the\r\ndifferent areas that may be relevant.\r\nNothing justifies international terrorism, and\r\nnobody in good faith would give reason to the minds of\r\nthose responsible for terrorist acts. But let us not be\r\nblind: terrorism prospers and gets public support\r\namong populations subjected to particular situations of\r\npoverty, social and political exclusion and inequality.\r\nThese factors do not, in any way, justify terrorism.\r\nNevertheless, they contribute to increased tensions,\r\npromote conflict situations and thus provide fertile\r\nground for extremism, fanaticism and other violent and\r\nunacceptable forms of political expression.\r\nWe must conduct this fight on all fronts, from\r\nconstraining action to education, from justice\r\nenforcement and crime prevention to the promotion of\r\ndevelopment. Only with comprehensive solutions will\r\nit be possible to find ways to overcome problems of\r\nextreme complexity.\r\nWe are debating this important issue under very\r\npressing circumstances. The practical conditions are\r\nnow in place to begin a rigorous international response\r\nto bring to justice those personally responsible for the\r\ncrimes and to pursue all legitimate actions in order to\r\nprevent their repetition in the future. A coherent\r\ncampaign must be implemented on behalf of the values\r\nrepresenting justice, tolerance and the dignity of human\r\nlife. A fight must also be waged for our essential\r\nvalues of democracy, the rule of law and the pre-\r\neminence of human rights. Maintaining and reaffirming\r\nthese values, especially during the difficult moments\r\nwe are going through, will be the best expression of\r\nour resolve not to see the normality of our societies\r\nchallenged by criminals. We cannot allow terror to\r\ndictate the rules of our lives.\r\nThis becomes a decisive struggle between basic\r\nvalues, patterns of life and concepts of human dignity.\r\nBut let us not confuse things. This is not a fight\r\nbetween civilizations. It is not a struggle between the\r\nWest and the Muslim world. One need not use\r\nhistorical memory to understand that fanaticism and\r\nfundamentalism are not exclusive to any region, culture\r\nor religion.\r\nIt is also very important to note that the Muslim\r\ntradition has represented, throughout the centuries, one\r\nof the most tolerant forms of civilization. Its values\r\nbelong to our common heritage, and in my own country\r\nwe are very proud of the role these values have played\r\nin our history. Portugal has Arab and Muslim countries\r\namong its best friends, and we will never equate a most\r\nrespected religion with a group of fanatics who have\r\nirresponsibly and unacceptably acted in its name.\r\nMuslim countries and Muslim peoples have been\r\nafflicted for many years by international terrorism.\r\nThey are as committed as we are to this struggle and, at\r\nthis very delicate moment, I feel it is necessary to\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nstress this before this Assembly. Let us be clear about\r\nthis and firmly reject and fight all expressions of\r\nracism, xenophobia and related intolerance.\r\nAs I have said, Portugal has been working hard\r\nwith its partners in the European Union to find the best\r\nways and means to contribute to this common effort.\r\nEuropean leaders recently decided to take major steps\r\nto deal with this threat, bringing together many of our\r\njudicial and intelligence capacities. We believe that\r\nthese efforts, to have full effect, should be pursued in\r\nother regional dimensions and be coordinated at the\r\nglobal level.\r\nWe urge Member States to consider taking all\r\nnecessary measures to develop a framework of\r\ninternational judicial cooperation on criminal matters.\r\nThis is the only way to ensure the necessary exchange\r\nof information to permit law enforcement institutions\r\naround the world to tackle the spread of international\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe must recognize that for some time the\r\nquestion of international terrorism has not been high on\r\nour agenda at the United Nations. We know the\r\nconceptual difficulties this Organization has had to\r\nconfront on this issue and how problematic it has been\r\nto overcome them.\r\nThese latest events seem to have changed the\r\nentire scenario. It has become urgent and imperative\r\nnot only to use all instruments of international law\r\nalready in force, but also to redirect most of our future\r\nattention to the completion of the indispensable legal\r\nframework to allow the United Nations to place itself\r\nat the forefront of this programme of action.\r\nIn this context, we very much welcome the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)\r\nand 1373 (2001). The Members of the United Nations\r\nalso must accede, sign, ratify and implement the 12\r\nconventions dealing with different aspects of\r\ninternational terrorism that constitute an existent\r\ncohesive body of law. Portugal has already ratified 10\r\nof these conventions and has signed the other two,\r\nwhich are in the process of urgent ratification.\r\nIn the longer term, this Assembly must consider\r\nwhat other legislative measures it can take in this\r\nrespect. The work of the working group created under\r\nthe Sixth Committee of the General Assembly needs to\r\nbe focused on the drafting of a comprehensive\r\nconvention against international terrorism, in a manner\r\nthat will preserve the acquis of the already existing\r\nconventions while addressing their lacunae.\r\nThis is a way to make this Organization useful\r\nacross the spectrum of international efforts and to\r\nguarantee that its legitimacy and values remain at the\r\ncore of all future actions to be implemented. We should\r\nnever forget that this Organization is the highest and\r\nthe universal expression of international cooperation\r\nand must always be preserved as such.\r\nThe Secretary-General has called our attention to\r\nthe looming humanitarian tragedy faced by the people\r\nof Afghanistan. It is also imperative that the\r\ninternational community mobilize the necessary\r\nresources to assist the millions of refugees threatened\r\nwith destitution and starvation.\r\nLet me end on a hopeful note.\r\nOur concerted efforts show clearly where the\r\ninternational community stands in the face of the recent\r\ntragic events. Our united nations can and will make a\r\ndifference in the fight against the threats before us. It is\r\na struggle for peace and respect for human life, where\r\none needs to take into account the risks and the\r\ncasualties that may befall us; a struggle for freedom,\r\nwaged under the rule of law and full respect for human\r\nrights, democratic values and the basic principles by\r\nwhich this Organization abides.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nIt is now over three weeks since the dastardly terrorist\r\nacts of 11 September. Our sympathies are directed to\r\nthe victims and our heartfelt condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica and all countries that lost nationals in the\r\nTwin Towers. Our hearts and prayers are with all the\r\nvictims.\r\nTerrorism has no religion, race or nationality.\r\nHowever, terrorists normally exploit and use those\r\nelements for maximum effect. Terrorism is despicable.\r\nIt is a cancer which if not rooted out will cause untold\r\nsuffering to be visited upon our society and the world.\r\nIn this effort, it is vitally important that the seeds of\r\nterrorism are addressed head-on.\r\nThe East African subregion has had an\r\nunfortunate brush with international terrorism. In\r\nAugust 1998, in a coordinated attack, terrorists bombed\r\nthe Embassies of the United States of America in the\r\ncapitals of Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi. A similar\r\nattempt against the United States Embassy in Kampala,\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nUganda, was thwarted. Over 200 people were killed,\r\nwhile thousands were injured. As a result, the East\r\nAfrican subregion established a Joint Committee to\r\ncoordinate our actions against terrorism.\r\nIt is in this regard that our country unreservedly\r\njoins in the collective expressions of outrage at the\r\nhorrific acts of terrorism committed in New York,\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania last month. Those\r\nterrorist acts represent an evolution of terrorism to\r\nhorrific new proportions. Our collective anger must\r\nnow be channelled towards concerted action to combat\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nThe terror and the tragedies that terrorists unleash\r\npose a threat to all societies. Evidently, terrorists take\r\nadvantage of the inadequacies of international legal\r\ninstruments, regulations, procedures and control,\r\nespecially in this era of globalization, to elude justice\r\nand accountability. Sovereignty alone can no longer\r\ncope with the threat of international terrorism. Many of\r\nthe recent tragedies have demonstrated the national\r\napproach to be grossly inadequate. The challenge to the\r\ninternational community is therefore how to overcome\r\nthese constraints. Needless to say, the United Nations\r\nprovides legitimacy for global ownership of the new\r\nwar against terrorism.\r\nWhereas our revulsion in the face of terrorism is\r\nnon-negotiable, it is equally crucial that this body\r\naddress the elements that breed such a cancer in\r\nsociety. When the dust has settled, it is incumbent upon\r\nthe General Assembly to ask the Secretary-General to\r\ncome up with a report that will facilitate informed\r\ndebate and ultimately a solution.\r\nTanzania is keenly aware that a successful war\r\nagainst terrorism will require a sustained, broad and\r\ncoordinated effort. It will require practical cooperation.\r\nIt will also require a review of our varying capabilities\r\nin waging this war. At times this will require rendering\r\nassistance to enhance the capabilities of those among\r\nus who may not be adequately equipped to confront the\r\nnew war.\r\nThis is important. It is important because at times\r\nsome information of vital significance may not be\r\navailable from a country, even if required, only because\r\nsome lack an appropriate regulatory regime to respond\r\nto the need. We must therefore devise collective\r\nstrategies to enhance our common capabilities to\r\naddress the challenge we face and to create a\r\nconducive, regulatory environment that is standardized,\r\nharmonized, effective and enforceable. A\r\ncomprehensive convention to combat international\r\nterrorism is now an urgent requirement.\r\nIt is also our view that strategies that work must\r\ninclude exchange of information and capacity-building\r\nfor intelligence and law enforcement within the broad\r\nalliance against terrorism. My country is painfully\r\naware that terrorists act on a global scale. Therefore, a\r\nsuccessful fight against terrorism demands\r\ninternational cooperation and continued unity among\r\nall of us. As we fight this war, no region, country or\r\npeople must be made to feel they are of no strategic\r\nsignificance.\r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania welcomes\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil in the wake of the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember. Terrorists cannot survive and flourish on a\r\nlarge scale if their activities cannot be funded. The\r\ninitiatives embodied in the instruments adopted by this\r\nAssembly, including the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, demand our unconditional\r\nsupport and implementation.\r\nThe United Nations has been and should be a\r\nmultilateral forum for effective international action\r\nagainst the kind of diabolic acts we have witnessed in\r\nthe recent past. Through this body, we can establish a\r\nrigorous but fair process for pursuing the perpetrators\r\nof terrorism. Indeed, through this body we have\r\nenacted landmark instruments providing appropriate\r\nmechanisms for enlisting foreign jurisdictions to\r\ncooperate in a multilateral framework for combating\r\nterrorism. We need to strengthen their implementation.\r\nThere is a host of ways in which terrorist\r\nactivities could be funded. Some of these lie outside\r\nthe formal regulatory regime. They have even included\r\nfunding charitable organizations or the creation of\r\noffshore accounts. While most of these are lawful\r\nendeavours, others have opened a window for the\r\nfunding of terrorism. To sort the legitimate from the\r\nillegitimate, cooperation with law enforcement at an\r\ninternational level is essential. But it is also critical that\r\nthis action be pursued in a legitimate manner and in a\r\nway that respects the sovereignty of all States. Indeed,\r\nall our efforts to stamp out the scourge of terrorism\r\nmust be pursued in a manner which does not stigmatize\r\nany people, religion or region, in the true spirit of the\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nslogan now common in the streets beyond this\r\nAssembly: “United we stand.”\r\nConcerted international action and effective\r\nnational measures are imperatives that go hand in hand.\r\nWe in Tanzania are keenly aware of our domestic\r\nresponsibilities in strengthening our collective efforts\r\nto combat terrorism. It is in this spirit that we support\r\nbilateral and multilateral measures aimed at combating\r\nterrorism. It is in our common interest that we work\r\nindividually and collectively towards our objective of\r\neradicating the scourge of terrorism.\r\nMr. Balestra (San Marino): As this is the first\r\ntime I have taken the floor at the fifty-sixth session, let\r\nme congratulate the President on his election. His task\r\nwill be particularly complex and challenging, but we\r\nfully trust in his competence and ability to direct our\r\nwork along this difficult path.\r\nOn behalf of the people and Government of San\r\nMarino, I wish to declare once more our harsh and firm\r\ncondemnation of the acts of inhuman violence\r\nperpetrated on 11 September. I would like to reiterate\r\nthe deepest solidarity of San Marino to the United\r\nStates of America and its people, and express our\r\ndeepest condolences to the families of the victims.\r\nUnder the norms of international criminal law, the\r\n11 September attack can be characterized as a crime\r\nagainst humanity, because of its large-scale nature, and\r\nbecause it was directed against a civilian population.\r\nThe international nature of this crime creates a duty on\r\nall States to assist in bringing culprits to justice.\r\nThe dramatic and catastrophic events of 11\r\nSeptember must make us reflect on the international\r\nscenario that has emerged since. For the first time in\r\nhistory, we are now forced to confront a new type of\r\nconflict, different in nature and connotation from past\r\nconflicts. It does not appear in its traditional form; it is\r\nneither one State against another nor a State against a\r\npolitical entity, and it is not even a State against a\r\ngroup of rebels or belligerents.\r\nThe sovereignty and integrity of a nation have\r\nbeen violated by an obscure and surreptitious enemy,\r\nan enemy without a face and without an identifiable\r\nstructure. For these reasons, this enemy is merciless\r\nand extremely frightening. All the countries in the\r\nworld, regardless of their size, ethnicity, political\r\norganization and economic condition, are exposed to\r\nthis new form of disruptive violence, which can and\r\nmust be eradicated.\r\nThe world is no longer only a network of States\r\ncoexisting side by side, but, rather, has a dense and\r\nsinister net of organized criminality, criminality\r\nextending its tentacles towards all corners of the planet.\r\nThis infamous chain of terrorism is ubiquitous, and its\r\nlinks are pervasive and hide among us.\r\nComplete and unconditional international\r\ncooperation among States is almost the only weapon\r\nwe possess to fight this threatening phenomenon. One\r\nmore weapon we have against terrorism is the whole\r\nbody of international law created to cooperate in this\r\nfield. It is nevertheless clear that these instruments\r\nneed to be ratified, implemented and complemented by\r\nmeasures and international agreements.\r\nI do not want to make this statement any longer\r\nthan it is. At this time, words are not necessary; we\r\nneed facts.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure the\r\nAssembly of the full and complete cooperation of the\r\nRepublic of San Marino to annihilate this new plague\r\nof terrorism, strengthen international law and spread a\r\nculture of peace and tolerance.\r\nLinking terrorism to a particular religion is a\r\nmistake, and is devious. Any form of violence, and\r\nterrorism in particular, perpetrated in the name of God\r\nis unacceptable and blasphemous.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): At the outset, I wish to\r\nreiterate the sentiments of deepest sympathy and\r\ncondolences conveyed by President Sam Nujoma, and\r\nindeed by the Government and the people of Namibia,\r\nto our host country, the United States of America, and\r\nin particular to all the families of the victims of the\r\ndespicable terror attacks of 11 September.\r\nWhen the General Assembly adopted resolution\r\n49/60, of 9 December 1994, the Member States did so\r\nin recognition of the thousands of victims of\r\ninternational terrorism. In so doing, we the Member\r\nStates undertook to combat and eliminate terrorism in\r\nall its condemnable manifestations, and affirmed our\r\nresolve to live up to our collective responsibility under\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe human tragedy of 11 September has again\r\nshown what terrorism has always stood for: calculated\r\nacts of death and destruction, and hurting, killing or\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\ndestroying innocent civilians and property without\r\nmercy. Its goal is the subordination of human life to the\r\nobjectives of terrorists.\r\nIndeed, various measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism have been discussed by this\r\nbody as far back as 1972. To that end several General\r\nAssembly resolutions have been adopted, urging our\r\ncollective resolve to uproot the scourge of terrorism.\r\nYet, many innocent people continue to be victims of\r\nterrorist attacks in many parts of the world, not least in\r\nmy own region. In the Southern African region, the\r\nterrorist activities of UNITA’s Jonas Savimbi have\r\ngone beyond the boundaries of Angola. For years, the\r\nAngolan people have been deprived of peace, security\r\nand development. Thousands of them have been\r\nstripped of their livelihood and human dignity. Away\r\nfrom the cameras, their silent cries, their agony and\r\ntheir gruesome pain remain hidden from the world.\r\nLikewise, to date many people in Namibia have been\r\nkilled and maimed as a result of the terrorist acts of\r\nSavimbi and his UNITA. Families have been harassed\r\nand have had their properties stolen or destroyed, all\r\nwith the aim of instilling fear and insecurity among our\r\npeople.\r\nIt is against that background that Namibia,\r\ntogether with other member States of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), has\r\ncontinued to call for further strengthening of United\r\nNations Security Council sanctions against UNITA. It\r\nis because of the untold suffering of civilians that\r\nNamibia continues to call on all Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations to honour and implement fully United\r\nNations sanctions against UNITA. Indeed, it is due to\r\nour firm belief in the dignity of all people that we\r\ncontinue to press for the elimination of hunger, poverty\r\nand deprivation so that we can all feel a sense of\r\nbelonging to the human family. Only then shall we\r\nhave eliminated the breeding ground for fear, want and\r\ndespair, in which terrorism thrives.\r\nThe terror attack that afflicted us all on 11\r\nSeptember, and terrorist activities all around the globe,\r\nmust strengthen our collective determination to ensure\r\nsecurity and prosperity for all people in the world.\r\nThe degree of sophistication of terrorist acts has\r\nimproved significantly. Terrorism has assumed an\r\nincreasingly globalized character. The abundant\r\navailability of both small arms and the most deadly\r\nsorts of weaponry, as well as easy access to the latest\r\ntechnology, help to create ever more dangerous types\r\nof terrorists. Furthermore, extensive international\r\nnetworks of organized criminals are creating an\r\ninfrastructure that is seriously threatening the stability\r\nof countries and entire regions. At the same time, there\r\nis an increasing threat to areas that affect human life.\r\nToday, those areas include modes of transportation,\r\nglobal communications systems and other networks\r\nthat regulate water and electricity consumption and\r\ncyber-inter-connectivity.\r\nThe world is, unfortunately, increasingly facing\r\never-evolving challenges and dangers — of which\r\nterrorism is undoubtedly among the greatest — that no\r\nState, big or small, rich or poor, can tackle alone.\r\nRegional cooperation and the coordination of efforts\r\nare therefore essential to combat terrorism. The\r\nadoption of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nConvention on the Prevention and Combating of\r\nTerrorism by the heads of State and Government of the\r\nOAU was an important development in augmenting\r\nglobal action. Namibia has signed the Convention and\r\nis in the process of ratifying it. The need for financial\r\nand material support on the part of regional\r\norganizations in order to combat this evil cannot be\r\noveremphasized. In addition, regional organizations\r\nshould coordinate their activities with the relevant\r\nUnited Nations agencies.\r\nThe consideration of this item in this forum again\r\nunderscores the indispensable role of the United\r\nNations, which responded unanimously by condemning\r\nthe outrageous terrorist attacks. The United Nations is\r\nthe central forum where we can all come together to\r\nagree on common policies affecting the international\r\ncommunity, and on how to implement them. The\r\nGeneral Assembly has for many decades adopted\r\nmeasures to combat terrorism. The 1994 Declaration on\r\nMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism and the\r\n1996 Declaration to Supplement that Declaration\r\ncategorically condemned all terrorist acts, methods and\r\npractices, irrespective of political, philosophical,\r\nideological, ethnic or religious considerations. So far,\r\nwe have created a network of interlocking conventions\r\nthat deal with the different facets of this scourge. It\r\nremains important for States to galvanize political will\r\nto become parties to those conventions and to ensure\r\ntheir full implementation.\r\nFurthermore, new legal instruments are needed to\r\ncounter specific forms and manifestations of terrorism.\r\nIn that regard, the adoption of the International\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism and the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings are important\r\nachievements. Similarly, the pending convention\r\nagainst acts of nuclear terrorism must be finalized and\r\neffectively implemented. Of paramount importance,\r\nhowever, is the need to put in place a comprehensive\r\nconvention for combating international terrorism. Such\r\na convention would not only provide a sound juridical\r\nframework for the application of existing conventions,\r\nbut would also enable Member States to establish a\r\nuniversally agreed definition of terrorism.\r\nFor some time now the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries has been reiterating its call for an\r\ninternational summit or other conference to be held\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations to formulate a\r\njoint international community response to terrorism in\r\nall its forms and manifestations, and for the urgent\r\nconclusion and effective implementation of a\r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism. We therefore\r\njoin all those who have reiterated the call for the\r\nconvening of such a conference or summit.\r\nAs I said before, combating terrorism requires\r\ncoordinated and comprehensive strategies. That is\r\nespecially true since terrorism tends increasingly to be\r\naccompanied by other heinous crimes with grave\r\nconsequences. Many of them have recently come under\r\nthe scrutiny of the United Nations. The issue of small\r\narms is one of them. As long as those weapons are\r\nfreely traded, terrorists will find no difficulty in arming\r\nthemselves. All efforts must therefore be made\r\ncomprehensively to implement the Programme of\r\nAction recently adopted by the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects. Similarly, the power\r\nand capacity of terrorist organizations also depend to a\r\ngreat extent on clandestine financing. Therefore, if we\r\nare successful in cutting off lifelines such as weapons\r\nand financing, significant gains can be made in the\r\nfight against terrorism.\r\nOver the years, the final communiqués of Foreign\r\nMinisters of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries\r\nadopted at meetings held during various sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly have, among other things, continued\r\nto address the need to combat terrorism. The Foreign\r\nMinisters of the Non-Aligned Movement, in addressing\r\nthe legitimate aspirations of peoples denied their right\r\nto self-determination, have stated:\r\n“We reaffirm the Movement’s principled\r\nposition under international law on the legitimacy\r\nof the struggle of peoples under colonial or alien\r\ndomination and foreign occupation for national\r\nliberation and self-determination, which does not\r\nconstitute terrorism, and call once again for the\r\ndefinition of terrorism to differentiate it from the\r\nlegitimate struggle of peoples under colonial or\r\nalien domination and foreign occupation, for self-\r\ndetermination and national liberation.”\r\nFor a people which for centuries has been\r\nsubjected to colonial domination and which had to\r\nresort to a national liberation struggle, such a\r\ndistinction is vital. We must together ensure that in the\r\ntwenty-first century no human being will live in\r\nbondage or suppression. Only then can we guarantee\r\nthe security of all of us and that of future generations.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\r\nconfirmed the fundamental values essential to\r\ninternational relations in the twenty-first century. These\r\ninclude the right of men and women to live their lives\r\nfree from fear of violence. Terrorism defies that value.\r\nHowever, the world leaders also resolved to take\r\nconcerted action against international terrorism and to\r\naccede as soon as possible to all the relevant\r\ninternational conventions. Clearly, there can be no\r\ngreater urgency than at this moment to implement this\r\nundertaking fully and comprehensively.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that the\r\nNamibian Government unequivocally condemns\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, whatever\r\nits motives and origins, and wherever and by\r\nwhomsoever it is committed. Namibia stands ready to\r\ncooperate with the international community in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism to ensure that the world is\r\npermanently rid of this evil. This is the time for all of\r\nus to reaffirm our commitment to peace and unity of\r\npurpose to strengthen our fight against all forms of\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nMr. Heinbecker (Canada): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Canada, I begin today\r\nby expressing our condolences to the families of the\r\npeople — the vast majority of them United States\r\ncitizens, but also Canadians and many other\r\nnationalities — who died in the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember. I also express the profound sympathy of the\r\nstaffs of the Canadian Mission to the United Nations\r\nand of the Canadian Consulate in New York. The\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\npeople who lost their lives were our neighbours, our\r\nfriends, our acquaintances; they were the fire-fighters\r\nfrom our local stations, the police officers from our\r\nlocal precincts. We are New Yorkers, as they were New\r\nYorkers. There but for the grace of God went any one\r\nof us in this Hall. This debate is about honouring the\r\nmemory of the people who died in New York and\r\nWashington and Pennsylvania, and of the countless\r\nother innocent victims of terrorism around the world.\r\nFate does not play favourites; there is no safe\r\ndistance from terrorism, and there is no diplomatic\r\nimmunity from evil. This time, we have been the lucky\r\nones. But that luck carries with it a profound duty.\r\nAnd so, on behalf of the Government of Canada, I\r\nexpress Canada’s resolve not to forgive, not to forget\r\nthe perpetrators of these heinous acts, and not to rest\r\nuntil they are brought to justice.\r\nThe right of Canada, and of the United States and\r\nof all other United Nations Members, to self-defence is\r\nclear under international law, enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and recognized again most\r\nrecently in Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)\r\nand 1373 (2001). Canada has joined in the invocation\r\nby the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of\r\narticle V, the mutual defence article, of the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty. I am here to pledge Canada’s full\r\nparticipation in the struggle that lies ahead.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Government of Canada fully supports the\r\nSecretary-General in his appeal to all Member states to\r\nratify and implement all existing counter-terrorism\r\ninstruments. Canada has implemented 10 of the\r\ncounter-terrorism conventions, and the Government\r\nwill introduce shortly the requisite legislation to\r\nimplement the remaining two: the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\r\nand the International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nthe Financing of Terrorism. With respect to the\r\nadoption of a draft comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism and of a draft convention against nuclear\r\nterrorism, we urge all Member States to join us in\r\nsurmounting the remaining difficulties and completing\r\nthe negotiations this autumn. If not now, when? If not\r\nby this Assembly, by whom?\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nSuccess against terrorists requires cooperative\r\nand coordinated action. To succeed, we need an active\r\nand forward defence, and we must also take the fight to\r\nthe terrorists. We must keep them on the defensive,\r\nwithout safe haven or succour. Combining a good\r\ndomestic defence with an active offence is the only\r\nway nations of the world will be able to exercise\r\neffectively their right to self-defence and restore an\r\nacceptable measure of security.\r\nThe Government of Canada commends the\r\nSecurity Council for the outstanding work it has done\r\nin resolution 1373 (2001). The wide range of action\r\nprescribed in that resolution — from denying financing\r\nand safe haven to encouraging compliance and\r\nimplementation — will take the fight to the terrorists.\r\nWe particularly applaud the decision of the Council to\r\nestablish a committee to monitor the implementation of\r\nthe resolution and the call for States parties to report on\r\nactions they have taken in accordance with the\r\nresolution. What monitoring mechanisms on\r\ncompliance ensure is that commitments are matched by\r\naction and words are matched by deeds. States that are\r\ngenuine in their pledges to fight terrorism need not fear\r\nthe oversight of their peers.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada is already largely in compliance with\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). On Tuesday of this week,\r\nOttawa promulgated regulations under Canada’s United\r\nNations Act to implement key provisions of the\r\nresolution, including prohibiting financing and\r\nfundraising for, as well as freezing the assets of,\r\nterrorists. The Government is urgently reviewing\r\nexisting legislation and administrative practices to\r\ndetermine what else needs to be done to put Canada\r\ninto full compliance with the remaining provisions of\r\nthe resolution.\r\nIn response to the Secretary-General’s recent\r\nappeal, we have contributed an additional $5 million to\r\nhelp the dispossessed of Afghanistan; if circumstances\r\nwarrant providing more assistance, we will provide\r\nmore. We also stand ready to help those who might\r\nneed technical assistance in drawing up their own\r\nlegislation, as we have done for those who needed help\r\nin giving legislative effect to the undertakings they\r\nhave made with respect to the International Criminal\r\nCourt. We invite others likewise to assist in this\r\ncapacity-building effort.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nWe Canadians will work with our American\r\nfriends and neighbours to make our respective North\r\nAmerican homelands as secure as two open,\r\ndemocratic societies can be. In doing so, we will be\r\ntrue to our values, and we will draw strength from our\r\ndiversity. At the same time, we will take the steps we\r\njudge necessary to ensure the safety of Canadians and\r\nto reassure our American neighbours that Canada is not\r\nnow, and will not become, an insecure back door to\r\ntheir heartland. By the way, on this score, it is worth\r\nnoting that to this point there has been no evidence that\r\nthe perpetrators of the 11 September attacks crossed the\r\nborder into the United States from Canada. Still, we\r\nknow that we, like others, have work to do to enhance\r\nour common security, and we are resolved to do it.\r\nTo oversee the Canadian effort and to address\r\nimmediate concerns, Prime Minister Chrétien\r\nannounced Monday the creation of an Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of Ministers on Public Security and Anti-\r\nTerrorism under the leadership of the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, the Honourable John Manley. The\r\nCommittee will review legislation, regulations, policies\r\nand programmes, including those bearing on Canada’s\r\nrelations with the United States, to enable the\r\nGovernment to adjust promptly Canada’s approach to\r\npublic security.\r\nWe recognize that national action and bilateral\r\ncooperation are necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure\r\nour national security. Much more is needed. As the\r\nSecretary-General pointed out in opening this debate,\r\nas terrible as the crimes of 11 September were, they\r\nwould have been much worse if the terrorists had had\r\naccess to weapons of mass destruction. It is therefore\r\nalso our duty to work together here in this Hall to\r\nstrengthen global norms against the proliferation and\r\nthe use of weapons of mass destruction. Let us enhance\r\nthe non-proliferation regime by ratifying the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, by enhancing\r\nthe Missile Technology Control Regime and\r\nproceeding to conclude the Biological Weapons\r\nProtocol. Let us also build on the modest results of the\r\nsmall arms Conference held in July. Let us ratify as\r\nwell the statute of the International Criminal Court, and\r\nlet us universalize the Ottawa Convention on\r\nlandmines. Let us recognize that à la carte\r\nmultilateralism will not make any of us any safer.\r\nClearly, strong multilateral cooperation in fighting\r\nterrorism is necessary.\r\nTo advance that cooperation, we should also\r\ninnovate to strengthen our present anti-terrorism\r\ninstruments. Why not consider new bodies with strong\r\nand specific counter-terrorism mandates and adequate\r\nresources to facilitate and coordinate our efforts? Why\r\nnot borrow some of the features of the Missile\r\nTechnology Control Regime, particularly the idea that\r\nmembership in good standing confers privileges and\r\nbad standing incurs consequences? Why not set up a\r\ndedicated United Nations Secretariat body with a\r\nmandate for research and capacity-building from\r\nMember States? Why not a high commissioner or a\r\nspecial representative of the Secretary-General against\r\nterrorism?\r\nThe terrorists sought to sow fear, but they are\r\nreaping outrage. They sought to trigger a war among\r\ncivilizations, but they have galvanized world opinion\r\nagainst themselves and against their twisted enterprise.\r\nThey have induced neither retreat nor resignation, but,\r\ninstead, a determination and a whole host of concrete\r\nactions aimed at them. Rather than strike a blow\r\nagainst the rule of law, they have struck a unifying\r\nchord among nations.\r\nThe world is watching us this week. Our words\r\nwill be noted, our promises entrusted to memory. But\r\nour promise to honour the victims of terrorism will be\r\njudged not by what we say here, but by what we do.\r\nThe opportunity and the privilege to do genuine\r\nand enduring good are given to very few. That\r\nopportunity and that challenge have been given to us.\r\nLet us discharge our obligation to the victims. Let us\r\nseize the moment by showing that the killing of\r\ninnocents is never justifiable and that the rule of law\r\nmust always prevail over hate. Let us lose no time in\r\ndoing our duty. Let the terrorists rue the day they\r\nchallenged the common decency of humanity.\r\nMr. Tadmoury (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\n11 September last, the world was stunned by the horror\r\nof the tragedy that struck the United States of America\r\nas a result of the barbaric acts of terror that killed\r\nthousands of innocents, terrified civilians and led to\r\ndevastating losses for the entire international\r\ncommunity. But expressions of condemnation and\r\noutrage cannot fully express the feelings of grief and\r\nsadness that have gripped so many throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nIn discussing the events that took place in the\r\nUnited States of America in the framework of the\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\ndebate on measures to eliminate international\r\nterrorism, we must recall the efforts that have been\r\nmade by the international community to address the\r\nissue of terrorism since 1972. These efforts have led to\r\nthe adoption of 12 conventions against terrorism, while\r\nthe international community is currently drafting a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\nand concluding its consideration of unresolved issues\r\nrelated to the draft convention on the suppression of\r\nacts of nuclear terrorism. We cannot fail to commend\r\nthe role of the Ad Hoc Committee on terrorism and\r\nexpress the hope that it will retain on its agenda the\r\nissue of convening a high-level international\r\nconference under United Nations auspices to prepare a\r\njoint organized response of the international\r\ncommunity to terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nSince the 1970s, the Arab States have launched\r\nserious initiatives to combat terrorism, including the\r\ncall to convene an international conference to define\r\nterrorism and another to combat it. These initiatives\r\nhave enjoyed widespread international support. It\r\nwould be useful to recall that Arab States have adopted\r\nanti-terrorist conventions in the context of the Arab\r\nLeague, the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nand the Organization of African Unity. In this regard, I\r\nwould add that Lebanon has acceded to and ratified 10\r\nof the 12 relevant international conventions on\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nOur meeting today is an important opportunity to\r\ninform the Assembly of Lebanon’s position in the wake\r\nof the terrorist attacks in the United States of America\r\non 11 September. Lebanon reiterates its readiness to\r\ncooperate in all seriousness and responsibility with the\r\nUnited States of America and the United Nations in\r\ncombating terrorism in the context of the principles of\r\ninternational law and national sovereignty. Lebanon is\r\nprepared to respond positively to any international\r\ninitiative to formulate a common definition of\r\nterrorism, including the initiative to convene an\r\ninternational conference. Lebanon reaffirms the need to\r\navoid linking terrorism to Arabs and Muslims in order\r\nto avoid a clash of civilizations and of religions.\r\nFinally, Lebanon stresses the need to differentiate\r\nbetween the legitimate struggle of peoples against\r\nforeign occupation and terrorism, which attacks human\r\nrights and all the human values enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter and the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nIn the current circumstances of the world today,\r\nLebanon and its President, Government and people\r\nreaffirm their condemnation and denunciation of and\r\nrevulsion at the terrorist attacks against New York and\r\nWashington, D.C. These tragedies have moved peoples\r\nthroughout the world and shaken international stability.\r\nThe terrifying images we have seen will forever remain\r\nevidence of the horrific nature of and the need to\r\ncombat terrorism, which has been denounced by all\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nThe battle against terrorism must not be carried\r\nout by military means alone. We believe that the\r\ninternational community is called upon today to make\r\nfurther urgent efforts to resolve the fundamental\r\nconflicts that are festering in many regions of the world\r\ntoday. Every day, those conflicts inspire despair,\r\nfrustration and violence. Foremost among these\r\nconflicts is that between Arabs and Israelis, the core of\r\nwhich is Israel’s occupation of Arab lands by force and\r\nwithout legitimacy. Having reached an advanced stage,\r\nthe peace process in the Middle East came to a halt,\r\nwasting much precious time.\r\nToday, we have a significant opportunity to end\r\nthis historic conflict on the basis of the resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy, particularly Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nSurely, a just and comprehensive settlement will\r\nstrengthen stability, peace and security in such a vital\r\nregion of the world.\r\nHistory teaches us that dialogue, outreach,\r\ntolerance and understanding are the means of\r\ninteraction between civilizations in a world where there\r\nis no longer any place for isolationism or withdrawal\r\ninto one’s own cocoon. The United Nations, created by\r\nthe will of its Member States and in which all of the\r\nworld’s civilizations are represented, is called upon to\r\nreactivate its humanitarian and cultural bodies to\r\nattenuate the artificial perceived tensions among\r\ncivilizations, to promote its role in addressing crises, to\r\nuproot evil, to establish justice and righteousness and\r\nto raise the flag of outreach among States and peoples.\r\nMr. Okio (Congo) (spoke in French): In taking\r\nthe floor for the first time, I should like to join all\r\nprevious speakers in extending my sincere\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Han and to the other members of\r\nthe Bureau on their election and to assure them of my\r\ndelegation’s full cooperation. Mr. Han’s great\r\nexperience as a diplomat and specialist in economic\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nissues are extremely valuable and will, we are sure,\r\nenable him successfully to conclude his difficult and\r\nexalted tasks.\r\nMr. Rodolphe Adada, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Cooperation and Francophonia of the Republic\r\nof the Congo — who is unable to attend this debate —\r\nhas asked a member of the Congo mission to read out\r\nthe following message:\r\n“On 11 September 2001 — a day which\r\nsome speakers have called ‘Black Tuesday’ — a\r\nword was written in letters of blood in the sky of\r\nthe United States of America: terrorism. In\r\nattacking the United States and the cosmopolitan\r\nand quintessentially international city of New\r\nYork only a few days before the opening of the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on\r\nchildren, the terrorists once again demonstrated\r\nthe appalling nature of their ideology and, above\r\nall, the rampant threat which they represent. In a\r\nword, they laid down a challenge to the\r\ninternational community.\r\n“Having learned of these attacks, on 12\r\nSeptember the Council of Ministers of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of the Congo,\r\npresided over by His Excellency Mr. Denis\r\nSassou-Nguesso, the President of the Republic\r\nand head of State, met to unequivocally condemn\r\nthose barbaric acts and to declare themselves in\r\nsolidarity with the people and the Government of\r\nAmerica and to express their profound\r\ncondolences to the bereaved families. At the\r\nnational level, steps were taken to protect\r\nAmerican interests on Congolese soil.\r\n“By showing us just how vulnerable we are,\r\nthose barbaric acts have prompted us to ask who\r\nmight be next if we are not united and resolute in\r\nour response.\r\n“It is clear that what is at stake in our debate\r\nare the hopes and fears of our populations, for\r\nwhom the threat of terrorism is now more real\r\nthan ever.\r\n“Indeed, in the wake of these barbarous\r\nacts, we cannot fail to recall that the Congo\r\nbecame the victim of a terrorist act on 19\r\nSeptember 1989, when a UTA Airlines DC-10\r\ncivilian aircraft was blown up over the Ténéré\r\ndesert, Niger, resulting in the death of nearly 200,\r\nincluding 49 Congolese nationals.\r\n“Congo built a memorial in the centre of its\r\ncapital city as a tribute to those innocent victims.\r\n“Furthermore, in memory of all the innocent\r\nvictims of terrorism throughout the world, 19\r\nMay has been proclaimed a ‘Day to Combat\r\nTerrorism’. It has been commemorated each year\r\nsince 1996 as a way to demonstrate our\r\ncondemnation of terrorism, as well as to ensure\r\nthat our people remain alert in the face of a\r\ncontinuing threat.\r\n“Generally speaking, there has also,\r\nunfortunately, been a steady increase in the\r\nnumber of terrorist acts on our continent of\r\nAfrica.\r\n“The horrific nature of all of these acts\r\nreveals the real threat that the rejection of\r\ndiversity and fanaticism represents to modern\r\ncivilization and the values of peace, fraternity,\r\nfreedom and tolerance that characterize human\r\nsociety and the community of nations.\r\n“That is why the Government of the Congo\r\nbelieves that actions such as those that have\r\nplunged the United States of America and the\r\ndemocratic world into mourning are likely to set\r\nhumanity back several years, and that the\r\nproblems that arise in today’s world cannot and\r\nwill not be resolved through acts of terrorism.\r\n“Given the threat of terrorism, which is now\r\nglobal in nature, the fundamental question is how\r\nto combat a scourge that transcends the borders of\r\nStates.\r\n“In this regard, our Government has chosen\r\nto participate broadly in multilateral instruments\r\nto combat terrorism and, on that basis, we have\r\nadopted several measures aimed at incorporating\r\ninto our domestic legislation our international\r\nobligations to prevent and suppress international\r\nterrorism.\r\n“The recent acts of terrorism, which we\r\ncondemn, have prompted us not only to declare\r\nthat we are in solidarity with the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States but, in\r\nparticular, to reaffirm solemnly the Government\r\nof the Congo’s attachment to and support for all\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\ninitiatives designed to eradicate international\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\n“The Republic of the Congo is aware that\r\nthe struggle against terrorism will require the\r\nparticipation of all modern States that are\r\ndedicated to progress, respect for human rights,\r\npeace and international security. The solution\r\nmust be a transnational one.\r\n“My delegation would like to emphasize the\r\nneed to use the entire arsenal of existing legal\r\ninstruments designed to combat terrorism — that\r\nis, the 12 that are now available.\r\n“That is why we support all concerted\r\naction taken in solidarity with the international\r\ncommunity aimed at strengthening international\r\ncooperation for the prevention and suppression of\r\nterrorism in all of its manifestations.\r\n“Certainly, our response will be effective\r\nonly if we act in solidarity. However, our struggle\r\nwill be incomplete without a renewed vision of\r\nwhat our commitments must be and unless we\r\ntake into account the new and recent\r\ndevelopments in international terrorism.\r\n“Modern-day terrorism is using modern\r\ntechnology and modern conveniences.\r\n“It is therefore imperative that the\r\ninternational community fully implement the\r\ninternational anti-terrorist conventions and\r\nprepare itself for the new form of struggle that is\r\nrequired of it.\r\n“This new vision, which we fully support,\r\ncan guide this session and enable it to improve\r\nthe effectiveness of the existing legal framework\r\nwhile working to conclude negotiations on a draft\r\ncomprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism.\r\n“Convinced that the best and most lasting\r\nway of ensuring collective, concerted action in\r\nsolidarity aimed at the elimination of\r\ninternational terrorism, the Congo, acting with\r\ngreat conviction, optimism and determination,\r\nwould like to join with the entire international\r\ncommunity to take action against terrorists and\r\nthose who provide them with support of any\r\nkind.”\r\nMr. Tolentino Dipp (Dominican Republic)\r\n(spoke in Spanish): The Government of the Dominican\r\nRepublic would like to reaffirm that it condemns the\r\nterrorist acts that took place in the cities of New York\r\nand Washington. We would also like to express once\r\nagain our sympathy for the pain and grief that is\r\nafflicting this nation and other nations as a result of the\r\nloss of their citizens who became the victims of this\r\nindescribable tragedy.\r\nAt a meeting of the General Assembly of the\r\nOrganization of American States on 21 September, the\r\nDominican Republic expressed explicit support for a\r\nresolution condemning the attacks against the United\r\nStates of America and repudiating terrorism. In line\r\nwith that position, the Dominican Republic will give its\r\nvote of approval to the conclusions of the General\r\nAssembly, confident as we are that they will be in line\r\nwith the principles of peace, cooperation and solidarity\r\nthat constitute the historical foundations of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nSince 1972, the United Nations has expressed its\r\nconcern about the spread of terrorism, aware that\r\nglobal aspirations for a better world will never be\r\nfulfilled as long as hatred and violence persist. Many\r\nagreements have been adopted by this Organization in\r\norder to prevent, fight and condemn actions that are\r\nfuelled by such sentiments.\r\nThe creation of an Ad Hoc Committee with the\r\nmandate to elaborate a comprehensive convention on\r\nterrorism and to organize a high-level conference to\r\nformulate an organized, joint response from the\r\ninternational community to all manifestations of\r\nterrorism, are clear signs of this concern.\r\nThese initiatives also reflect the Organization’s\r\ndetermination to strengthen international cooperation\r\naimed at establishing a legal order that is both\r\nrespectful of its institutional Charter and, at the same\r\ntime, practical and effective in combating this\r\nthreatening scourge.\r\nWe, the Member States, must not shrink from\r\nheeding the persistent appeals of the United Nations to\r\nratify these agreements.\r\nUnfortunately, these recent tragic events, which,\r\ndue to their magnitude, touched our collective\r\nconscious horrifically and put us on our guard, inform\r\nus that now more than ever the entire international\r\ncommunity should reflect deeply on terrorism.\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.18\r\nThe attacks on New York and Washington were\r\nconsidered aggressions against peace and triggered a\r\nspontaneous demonstration of solidarity on the need to\r\ndevelop the legal mechanisms necessary to fight\r\nterrorism and to forge the truly harmonious coexistence\r\nof all peoples.\r\nHowever, the most distinguished virtue of the\r\ndemocratic essence of the United Nations is its\r\nvocation and will to respect human rights. Thus,\r\nalthough we recognize that terrorism is the antithesis of\r\nthat virtue, we should not combat it by abandoning\r\nthose rights, pursuing a reaction of legitimate defence\r\nspurred by vengeance. Rather, we should apply\r\ninternational law and justice.\r\nTo the benefit of this democratic vocation and\r\nwill, the leaders of the United States Government have\r\noften affirmed that the response to the terrorist acts of\r\n11 September will not be the product of vengeance.\r\nThat stance honours their humanist and democratic\r\ntradition, the legacy of the founding fathers of this\r\ngreat nation.\r\nDespite the sad consequences of terrorism, we\r\nmust not become divided or contradict each other in a\r\nfight that we are all a part of. The fight against\r\nterrorism must set an example in emphasizing the\r\nrespect that humanity professes for the virtue of\r\ndemocracy and the principles it stands for.\r\nOn the other hand, we wish to reiterate our\r\nconviction that terrorism is a phenomenon linked to\r\nmultiple circumstances, whose origins lie beyond\r\nideological concepts. While we must recognize the\r\nactions that security organizations and military\r\ninstitutions must logically take in order to combat\r\nterrorism, we must also analyse its causes in order to\r\nbehead the thousand-headed hydra it has shown itself\r\nto be.\r\nThe persistence and increase of injustice, extreme\r\npoverty, starvation, drugs, exclusion, prejudice, despair\r\ndue to lack of opportunities spawn delirium and\r\nirrationality, which often erupts in uncontrolled\r\nviolence.\r\nThe fight against terrorism must, above all, be\r\none of prevention, combat, and the condemnation of\r\nsuch social diseases.\r\nTherefore, we cannot content ourselves with\r\ndefining terrorism in order to understand its causes.\r\nThe definition of terrorism is already quite clear in\r\nterms of its goals and actions. Its causes, rather, are\r\nwhat should concern us most, since that is where its\r\norigins and manifestations are rooted.\r\nThese thoughts move us to propose that in the\r\nconclusions we reach in the General Assembly, we\r\nmust instruct the Ad Hoc Committee on terrorism to\r\nstudy in detail the economic, social, and cultural causes\r\nthat might foment terrorism. We sincerely believe that\r\na study of this nature could contribute positively to the\r\neradication of this debased form of human conduct.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
