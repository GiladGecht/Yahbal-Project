(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 166 (continued)\r\nMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/160 and\r\nCorr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Musambachime (Zambia): Zambia\r\ncondemns, in the strongest terms, the barbaric and\r\nterrorist acts committed against the United States of\r\nAmerica on 11 September 2001. I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to convey my Government’s deepest\r\nsympathies and sincere condolences to the United\r\nStates Government, its people and the families affected\r\nby these senseless and dastardly acts.\r\nThe President of Zambia, Frederick Chiluba, has\r\nalready issued two statements condemning these\r\nheinous and unjustified attacks. In the first statement,\r\nmade in his capacity as President of the Republic of\r\nZambia, Mr. Chiluba stated,\r\n“We unreservedly condemn these most\r\ndeplorable, heinous and wanton attacks on\r\ndefenceless people, which are an affront to all\r\nnorms of civilized human behaviour and a direct\r\nthreat to global peace and security. The\r\nperpetrators of these dastardly acts should be\r\nsought and swiftly brought to book to answer for\r\ntheir crimes”.\r\nIn the second statement, issued in his capacity as\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity, Mr.\r\nChiluba said,\r\n“We wish to state unreservedly that terrorist\r\nacts should have no place in today’s civilized\r\nworld and should, therefore, be strongly\r\ncondemned by the entire international\r\ncommunity”.\r\nToday, in this Assembly and from this podium, I\r\nreiterate the President’s condemnation of all acts,\r\nmethods and practices of terrorism by whomever,\r\nwhenever and wherever they are perpetrated. The\r\nconsequences of terrorism are indeed, the antithesis of\r\nsocial and economic development and, therefore,\r\nshould be fought by all democratic and peace-loving\r\nnations.\r\nI wish to assure the American Government of the\r\nfull and unconditional support and cooperation of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Zambia in all efforts to\r\npursue the perpetrators of these cowardly acts and to\r\nensure that they are brought to justice.\r\nBy definition, terrorism means violent acts\r\nintended to create a state of fear and insecurity in the\r\ngeneral public or a group of persons. My delegation\r\nhas noted with great admiration the response of the\r\nAmerican people to these acts of terror. The American\r\npeople have not been intimidated. Instead, they have\r\nbecome more united and determined in their resolve to\r\nrecover from this tragedy.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nMy delegation commends the gallant efforts of\r\nthe Mayor of New York, our host city, Mr. Rudolph\r\nGuiliani, who addressed us on Monday, 1 October, and\r\nof Governor George Pataki, in coordinating the rescue\r\nwork. Their strong leadership enabled the City to\r\nquickly organize and coordinate the resources required\r\nfor rescue and recovery operations.\r\nWe pay tribute to the brave and courageous\r\nmembers of the Fire Department of New York, the New\r\nYork Police Department, the Port Authority of New\r\nYork and New Jersey and others who made the ultimate\r\nsacrifice while rescuing those trapped in the wreckage.\r\nWe also commend the many volunteers who have saved\r\nso many lives and continue to give their time to the\r\nrescue and recovery efforts.\r\nPresident George W. Bush, the American\r\nGovernment, the Congress and the entire nation\r\ndeserve our praise for the tremendous support they\r\nhave given to our host city. The heavy death toll and\r\nthe level of destruction of property caused by the\r\nterrorist attacks in New York and Washington, whose\r\nimages we vividly saw on television with horror,\r\ndisbelief and indignation, have demonstrated to us the\r\nseriousness of the threat of terrorism. They have also\r\nunderlined the urgency with which the international\r\ncommunity must respond to this problem, whose\r\nmagnitude threatens international peace and security.\r\nIndeed, as the Secretary-General said last week,\r\nwhen he presented his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, the attack was\r\n“a blow, not against one city or one country, but\r\nagainst all of us ... an attack ... on our shared\r\nvalues. It struck at everything this Organization\r\nstands for: peace, freedom, tolerance, human\r\nrights and the very idea of a united human\r\nfamily.” (A/56/PV.7)\r\nThe large number of fatalities, who included\r\nnationals from 80 countries, and the destruction of\r\nimportant infrastructure, as well as the disruption of the\r\nnormal life of New Yorkers, the normal programme of\r\nthe United Nations, international travel and world\r\nfinancial markets all go to show that terrorism is a\r\nglobal problem, which requires an urgent global\r\nresponse.\r\nWe should not forget that this tragedy comes after\r\nterrorist attacks on the embassies of the United States\r\nin Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and\r\non the USS Cole in Yemen. The diversity of these\r\nattacks in various parts of the world clearly indicates\r\nthat terrorism should be of concern to all nations.\r\nMy delegation welcomes and supports the\r\nmeasures, including the diplomatic efforts, being\r\nundertaken by the United States Government to muster\r\nan international coalition in the wake of the attacks in\r\nNew York and Washington D.C. The perpetrators of\r\nthese barbaric and heinous attacks deserve our\r\nstrongest condemnation.\r\nThe Zambian Government joins other\r\nGovernments that have called for the immediate\r\nconclusion and implementation of a comprehensive\r\ninternational convention against terrorism. My\r\nGovernment is aware that much work has been done\r\nboth by the United Nations and by regional\r\norganizations in this regard. However, there is a need\r\nto coordinate all this work in order to establish a\r\nformidable and effective force against terrorism.\r\nIt is important that the United Nations play a\r\ncrucial and leading role in the global response to\r\nterrorism. The United Nations is the natural forum for\r\nbuilding the necessary universal coalition to give\r\ninternational legitimacy to the struggle against\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn view of its complicated nature, the fight\r\nagainst terrorism will not be easy. It will be difficult\r\nand protracted. There is, therefore, an urgent need for\r\nthe international community to adopt measures that are\r\ncomprehensive, effective and sustainable, which will\r\nnot only deal with the current violent acts of terror, but\r\nwill also involve long-term measures to prevent their\r\nrecurrence. Hence the need for the United Nations to\r\nplay a leading role.\r\nMy delegation would, therefore, like to express\r\nits fullest support for Security Council resolutions 1368\r\n(2001) and 1373 (2001), adopted on 12 September and\r\n28 September respectively, and General Assembly\r\nresolution 56/1, adopted on 12 September, which call\r\nfor urgent action to enhance international cooperation\r\nto prevent and eradicate acts of terrorism. It is\r\nimportant for the international community to rally\r\nbehind these resolutions and to promote unity of\r\npurpose in order to facilitate, strengthen and enforce\r\naction against terrorism.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that with the full\r\nimplementation of the measures contained in these\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nresolutions, especially those in Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), we will win this war. This is a\r\nwar the international community cannot afford to lose.\r\nIt is now up to us, as individual Members of the United\r\nNations, to do our part and help win the war.\r\nFor our part, my Government has undertaken to\r\ncooperate at the regional and international levels to\r\nprohibit and to prosecute all criminal acts intended or\r\ncalculated to provoke a state of terror in the general\r\npublic, a group of persons or individuals targeted for\r\nwhatever reasons, in any circumstance, as unjustifiable,\r\nwhatever considerations or factors may be invoked to\r\njustify them.\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): The\r\ntragedies of 11 September will go down in\r\ncontemporary history as one of the most heinous\r\ncrimes committed against innocent people. Some 6,000\r\nmen and women perished in the ruins of the World\r\nTrade Center, in Virginia and in the wreckage in\r\nPennsylvania, while thousands of others are suffering\r\nin hospitals. Who can hold back the tears, looking at\r\nthose photos along the sidewalks of Lexington Avenue,\r\nin Union Square, in New Jersey and elsewhere? They\r\nare proof of the suffering, the agony, the mourning of\r\nthe living over the tragic death of their husbands,\r\nwives, parents, children, siblings and friends.\r\nDeath in war is as painful as death in peace, I can\r\nassure the Assembly. Right after these horrendous\r\nkillings by the insane terrorists, President Tran Duc\r\nLuong and Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien of the\r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam, in their messages of\r\ncondolence addressed to President George Bush and\r\nSecretary of State Colin Powell, extended the deepest\r\nsympathy and condolences of the people and\r\nGovernment of Viet Nam to the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States of America and\r\nvoiced their indignation at and strong condemnation of\r\nthe barbarous acts, which involved the heavy loss of\r\ninnocent lives. The spokesperson of the Foreign\r\nMinistry of Viet Nam went on to say that the\r\nperpetrators should be brought to justice and severely\r\npunished.\r\nThe demand to vent the anger that has built up\r\ninside is understandable. In the same vein, it is\r\nnecessary to bring the planners, organizers and\r\nperpetrators of these senseless acts of terrorism to\r\njustice, but it should be done in such a way that it does\r\nnot turn into acts of vengeance, which can easily\r\nendanger other innocent people. Otherwise we could\r\nget into a vicious circle in which violence may lead to\r\nnumerous other rounds of violence, with no finality in\r\nsight.\r\nAs terrorism is going global, counter-terrorism\r\nshould go global as well. Solidarity and unity among\r\npeople around the world and their participation in a\r\ncommon endeavour are badly needed to meet the goal\r\nof rooting out terrorists from our daily life. To this end,\r\na comprehensive strategy should be worked out to deal\r\nwith the political, diplomatic and development issues\r\nof genuine concern. The United Nations, as a universal\r\nOrganization where every nation, big or small, acts on\r\nan equal footing, should play a key role in the process,\r\nthrough discharging its functions enshrined in the\r\nCharter, in accordance with international laws and\r\nrelevant international conventions.\r\nWhile condemning in the strongest terms acts of\r\nterrorism of the magnitude of those of 11 September,\r\nwe should be equally resolute in our determination to\r\npay attention to other forms of terrorism, such as\r\nkidnapping foreign citizens, bombarding foreign\r\nembassies and hijacking aeroplanes, to name just a few.\r\nHaving been victim of such acts of terrorism as the\r\nhijacking of an aeroplane of its national airline in 1978,\r\nthe attacks and bombings of its diplomatic\r\nrepresentation offices in a number of capitals in Europe\r\nand Asia in 1999 and the violation of its airspace by a\r\ncriminal pilot in 2000, Viet Nam is fully aware that it is\r\nvery important to have international cooperation in the\r\nprevention of those crimes and in the punishment of the\r\nculprits. It is the responsibility of each nation not to\r\nprovide shelter or support in whatever form to the\r\nterrorists, before, during or after such acts of\r\nbarbarism. Viet Nam is willing to fulfil its obligations\r\nin conformity with national and international law in a\r\nworldwide endeavour to counter terrorism.\r\nThere is a story about a happy six-year-old girl.\r\nShe was happy because her mother had taken her to the\r\ntop of World Trade Center building, as promised, so\r\nthat she could look at the panoramic view of New York\r\non that fateful day. She and her mother, together with\r\nthousands of others, disappeared, forever, in the ruins.\r\nIt is better to act than to react. We should not wait\r\nuntil the cow is stolen to lock the barn. Something\r\nshould be done, and done fast, in a manner that is\r\nallowed for under the Charter, international laws and\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\ninternational norms governing the relations among\r\nsovereign States.\r\nMr. Moutari (Niger) (spoke in French): May I\r\naddress to you, Sir, the heartfelt congratulations of the\r\nNigerian delegation on your eminent election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I also take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nthe Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan, on his eminent\r\nre-election to a second term at the helm of our\r\nOrganization. On behalf of the Niger, I pay a ringing\r\ntribute to him for the strides that the United Nations\r\nhas made during his first term and for his constant,\r\ntireless efforts in the service of humanity.\r\nThis debate on the measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism is taking place under\r\nexceptionally grave circumstances in the aftermath of\r\nthe despicable terrorist attacks perpetrated on 11\r\nSeptember in the United States — attacks that took\r\nthousands of innocent victims, men and women of all\r\nages, cultures and faiths and of more than 80\r\nnationalities.\r\nIn the wake of these terrible attacks, the Niger\r\nhas expressed its position through two messages\r\naddressed to the United States authorities — one by the\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Niger and the other by\r\nthe Government. These two documents state that the\r\nNiger vigorously and firmly condemns the blind\r\nviolence that has just struck innocent people. The\r\nNiger is committed to becoming involved in all\r\ninitiatives taken at the subregional and international\r\nlevels, particularly those initiated by the Organization\r\nof African Unity, the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and the United Nations, so that we can\r\ncome up with concerted, lasting solutions to the threat\r\nposed by terrorism to international peace and security.\r\nWe offer every means at our disposal for cooperating\r\nwith the United States of America on the exchange of\r\ninformation and intelligence. We invite the\r\ninternational community to display prudence and\r\ndiscernment to avoid any confusion between terrorism\r\nand Islam.\r\nThe Niger endorses the terms of Security Council\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), notably the\r\nappeal addressed to all States to work together with the\r\nutmost urgency to bring to justice those who\r\nperpetrated, organized and directed these terrorist\r\nattacks.\r\nThe Republic of the Niger condemns recourse to\r\nviolence as a means of putting ideas forward or settling\r\ndisputes. In practical terms, we have taken a number of\r\nmeasures to combat terrorism. At the international\r\nlevel, the Niger has proceeded to ratify the following\r\nmajor legal instruments designed to fight the various\r\nmanifestations of terrorism: the Convention on\r\nOffences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board\r\nAircraft; the Convention for the Suppression of\r\nUnlawful Seizure of Aircraft; the Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of\r\nCivilian Aviation; the Convention on the Prevention\r\nand Punishment of Crimes against Internationally\r\nProtected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents; and\r\nthe Organization of African Unity Convention for the\r\nElimination of Mercenarism in Africa.\r\nMoreover, the Niger signed this year, in\r\nconformity with article III of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a safeguards\r\nagreement with the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency, for the purpose of verifying compliance with\r\nobligations assumed under the terms of that Treaty in\r\norder to ensure that nuclear energy is not diverted away\r\nfrom peaceful uses towards the production of nuclear\r\nweapons or any other nuclear explosive devices.\r\nIn the same context, the Niger also entered into a\r\nprotocol this year with the Preparatory Commission for\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nOrganization relating to the establishment of two\r\ninternational monitoring stations in the Niger.\r\nMy country has furthermore begun the process of\r\nratifying a number of texts on terrorism. These include\r\nthe International Convention against the Taking of\r\nHostages and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty.\r\nFinally, my country will begin as soon as possible\r\nthe process of ratifying the following conventions: the\r\nInternational Convention against the Recruitment, Use,\r\nFinancing and Training of Mercenaries, the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings, the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the\r\nProtocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of\r\nViolence at Airports Serving International Civil\r\nAviation, supplementary to the Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of\r\nCivil Aviation. Those are our activities at the\r\ninternational level.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nDomestically, the relevant provisions of Niger’s\r\npenal code punish acts of terrorism in conformity with\r\ninternational and regional conventions on the subject.\r\nAnd article 78 and subsequent articles of our penal\r\ncode punish attacks, plots and other crimes against the\r\nauthority of the State and against the security of our\r\nnational territory.\r\nFighting and eradicating international terrorism\r\nrequires comprehensive collective action within the\r\nframework of international law, of which the United\r\nNations is the repository. Here, I hail the\r\nOrganization’s important contribution in the legal\r\nsphere. Under United Nations auspices, no less than 12\r\nconventions have been formulated to deal with various\r\naspects of terrorism. And beyond those legal\r\ninstruments, two draft conventions are under discussion\r\nin the Sixth Committee. Niger hails the sponsors of the\r\ninitiatives in that regard, India and the Russian\r\nFederation.\r\nThe draft text initiated by India relates to a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nThat would be an important legal instrument defining\r\nthe concept of international terrorism, because other\r\nconventions on international terrorism are sectoral in\r\nnature. The draft convention proposed by the Russian\r\nFederation relates to the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism.\r\nMy country very much hopes that those two draft\r\ntexts will be completed as soon as possible. The\r\nadoption of the two draft instruments would provide\r\nthe legal arsenal the international community needs to\r\ncombat and eradicate this scourge.\r\nLet me recall two key truths that have emerged as\r\na leitmotif of this debate. First, Islam is a religion of\r\npeace, a religion of moderation. Thus, no credible\r\ninterpretation of the basic sources of the religion of the\r\nProphet can possibly justify murder or suicide, or even\r\nless suggest that these offer a shortcut to paradise.\r\nMuslim scholars the world over are unanimous about\r\nthat. And the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\r\nwhich brings together 56 States representing nearly a\r\nbillion Muslims, has strongly condemned these acts as\r\ncontrary to Islam, to its own resolutions and to the\r\nConvention of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference on Combating International Terrorism.\r\nSecondly, terrorism derives from blind\r\nfanaticism, which is in turn born of ignorance and\r\npoverty. It follows that, ultimately, any strategy for the\r\ntotal eradication of terrorism cannot be limited to ad\r\nhoc or unilateral action. Niger therefore welcomes the\r\nemergence of a consensus view that if the fight against\r\nterrorism is to succeed, it will have to be collective and\r\nwill have to encompass the need for a more just and\r\nequitable international economic and political order\r\nthat takes more careful account of the interests of the\r\ngreatest number of people.\r\nIt is obvious that extreme poverty, injustice and\r\nmyriad frustrations can lead only to the extremism that\r\nposes a serious threat to the whole of mankind. For our\r\nfight to be effective, it must therefore be multisectoral\r\nand must call for an accelerated fight against poverty\r\nand injustice.\r\nWe hope that the high-level international\r\nconference proposed by the Non-Aligned Movement\r\ncan provide an appropriate opportunity to formulate a\r\nprogramme of international cooperation that would\r\ninclude, inter alia, substantial technical and financial\r\nassistance to the least developed countries to enable\r\nthem to make a meaningful contribution to the\r\ninternational fight against terrorism. Those measures\r\nshould be complemented by other forthcoming\r\nconferences, including the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, to be held at Monterrey,\r\nMexico, and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held at Johannesburg, South\r\nAfrica.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nTerrorism is among the most important challenges\r\nfacing the international community. It arises time and\r\nagain in the form of crimes against many innocent\r\ncivilians. These crimes are intended to intimidate\r\nsocieties and to spread chaos and panic among peoples,\r\nand they serve to remind us of our responsibility to\r\nconfront and eradicate this phenomenon.\r\nEvents have proved that terrorist acts result from\r\nextremist thinking unrelated to any particular\r\ngeographical area, culture, religion or other factor.\r\nTerrorism breaches the basic values and principles\r\nembraced by the members of the international\r\ncommunity to define their behaviour, and seeks to\r\nreturn us to the law of the jungle and to destroy the\r\ndoctrine of free will.\r\nHere, my delegation reiterates the powerful\r\ncondemnation issued by the Government of Kuwait of\r\nthe 11 September terrorist acts against the United\r\nStates and its friendly people. We convey our heartfelt\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims, and we pray\r\nGod to grant them patience and to hasten the recovery\r\nof those who were injured. We reaffirm our total\r\nsupport for United States Government efforts to\r\nconfront terrorism and the criminal acts against it.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in confronting the\r\nterrorist acts against the United States began less than\r\n24 hours after the perpetration of those unprecedented\r\ncrimes against humanity. The Security Council adopted\r\nits resolution 1368 (2001) of 12 September 2001, by\r\nwhich it condemned the terrorist attacks against the\r\nUnited States. On the same day, the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 56/1, by which it too condemned the\r\nterrorist attacks against the United States. I believe that\r\nthe next Security Council resolution on this matter,\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which was adopted on 28\r\nSeptember under Chapter VII of the Charter,\r\nconstitutes a political and legal response that will help\r\nus excise this cancer that has spread throughout the\r\nbody of our world.\r\nWe in Kuwait are in full support of all those\r\nUnited Nations endeavours, and we pledge our full\r\ncooperation with the international community in any\r\naction that could result in the eradication of these\r\ncrimes, which are in fact crimes against all humanity,\r\nin bringing their perpetrators to justice, and in studying\r\ntheir root causes and reasons with a view to eliminating\r\nthem or easing their impact.\r\nInternational terrorism is one of the major issues\r\non which the entire international community is\r\nfocusing, because this phenomenon poses a specific\r\ndanger to people’s lives. No State, however large or\r\nsmall, can be immune to terrorism.\r\nThe phenomenon of terrorism did not come into\r\nexistence only recently. The world has been aware of it\r\nfor a long time now. What is new, however, is the\r\nincrease, in the last few years, of the number of\r\nincidents and the expansion of its scope.\r\nKuwait has been, and still is, a victim of\r\nterrorism, and in particular State terrorism. The Amir\r\nof Kuwait was the subject of an assassination attempt\r\nduring which a Kuwaiti aircraft was hijacked and\r\nKuwaiti citizens killed. Many Kuwait institutions have\r\nbeen bombed, killing many innocent civilians and\r\ncausing tremendous material losses. Thus, when we\r\nspeak of terrorism, we speak of a reality that we have\r\nlived through in recent years.\r\nThe State of Kuwait wishes to affirm that\r\ncombating terrorism is the responsibility of all\r\ncountries of the world. We must work at all levels to\r\ncombat terrorism in a manner that does not contravene\r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. All\r\nStates, therefore, must take the necessary legal\r\nmeasures — at the local, regional and international\r\nlevels — to combat and eradicate terrorism. They must\r\nalso implement the provisions of international law and\r\nof the relevant internationally binding resolutions, in\r\norder to suppress the execution, financing, or\r\ninstigation of terrorist acts and to prevent the\r\nharbouring of their perpetrators. We would like to\r\nemphasize the importance of adopting carefully\r\nthought-out measures within that legal framework.\r\nIn that context, Kuwait supports the convening of\r\nan international conference under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations whose goal would be to arrive at a clear\r\ndefinition of terrorism and to work on an organized\r\njoint response by the international community as a\r\nwhole against terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nThis is a responsibility that all of us must\r\nshoulder. The international community must\r\nconcentrate on the importance of addressing the root\r\ncauses that have led to the escalation of the\r\nphenomenon of terrorism and of eradicating such\r\ncauses.\r\nKuwait reaffirms once again its total\r\ncondemnation and rejection of all forms of terrorism.\r\nHowever, we must draw a distinction between the\r\ngenuine struggle of peoples for self-determination in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and\r\nterrorism that targets innocent civilians.\r\nWe in Kuwait believe that the struggle of the\r\nPalestinian people, for example, in its legitimate\r\nresistance to Israeli occupation, cannot by any means\r\nbe considered a form of terrorism. It is a legitimate\r\nform of self-defence and a defence of the rights of the\r\npeople, pre-eminent among which is the right to life, to\r\nland and to sovereignty.\r\nA genuine source of concern is the campaign\r\nbeing waged by the mass media to try to link Islam\r\nwith terrorism. Needless to say, Islam, like many other\r\ndivine religions, prohibits the killing of innocent\r\ncivilians. This is in accordance with the principles of\r\ninternational law, which aim at strengthening\r\ncooperation between peoples in order to establish\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\npeace. Islam is a religion of peace, love and\r\nbrotherliness. God Almighty says in the Koran:\r\n“That if anyone slew a person — unless it be for\r\nmurder or for spreading mischief in the land — it\r\nwould be as if he slew the whole people. And if\r\nanyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the\r\nlife of the whole people.” (The Holy Koran, V:32)\r\nWe would like, therefore, to emphasize that it is\r\ninadmissible to link terrorism and Islam, or terrorism\r\nand Arabs, if we wish to avoid a clash of religions and\r\ncivilizations — the Arab and Islamic world on the one\r\nhand, and the West on the other. We reject that linkage,\r\nwhich is condemned on the international level. Anyone\r\nwho says such things does not want peace or the well-\r\nbeing of peoples and is working against all values of\r\npeaceful coexistence between peoples, religions and\r\ncultures.\r\nOur Holy Koran, which is the highest constitution\r\nfor all Muslims, is based on the concept that\r\n“The most honoured of you in the sight of Allah\r\nis (he who is) the most righteous of you.”\r\nThe Holy Koran also says that there is no difference\r\nbetween an Arab and a foreigner; only piety counts. It\r\nis well-known linguistically that a foreigner refers to a\r\nnon-Arab. This is our religion. This is our Arab\r\nculture. These are the principles of coexistence we\r\nabide by, which conform to relevant international\r\nconventions and the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nOur last prayer is to thank God and to praise the\r\nAlmighty.\r\nMr. Shihab (Maldives): I would like to begin by\r\nreiterating my Government’s condemnation of the\r\nhorrendous terrorist attacks on New York City;\r\nWashington, D.C.; and Pennsylvania on 11 September\r\n2001. I would like also to reaffirm the condolences of\r\nmy Government to the Government and to the people\r\nof the United States on the great loss of human life and\r\nthe trauma caused by the atrocious attacks. I also offer\r\nmy Government’s condolences to the other delegations\r\nwhose compatriots were also among the victims of the\r\noutrage of 11 September.\r\nWe must not, we cannot and we should not\r\ntolerate terrorism in any form.\r\nThe attacks on the United States have\r\nundoubtedly given a new, more sinister meaning to\r\ninternational terrorism. The tremendous loss of life and\r\nincalculable damage to property resulting from the\r\nattacks has demonstrated the viciousness and the\r\nheinous nature of international terrorism and the pain\r\nand anguish that it can cause to human beings. These\r\nattacks have confirmed that civilization is no guarantee\r\nagainst barbarism.\r\nMy country was among the first States to\r\ncondemn the terrorist attacks on the United States in\r\nthe strongest possible terms. The Maldives has always\r\ndenounced and deplored terrorism in unequivocal terms\r\nwherever and whenever it has occurred. Upon hearing\r\nthe news of the barbaric attacks on the United States,\r\nPresident Gayoom immediately telephoned the United\r\nStates Government to condemn the attacks and pledged\r\nfull support to the United States in the hour of its\r\ntragedy. We stand by that pledge and we are\r\ncooperating fully with the United States in taking\r\nmeasures against terrorism. Small as our country is,\r\nand vulnerable also to attacks by terrorists, we took\r\nimmediate steps to increase our vigilance against any\r\nmovement by any terrorist from anywhere.\r\nMy country believes that strengthening the\r\nexisting national, regional and international legal\r\nframeworks against terrorism is essential to effectively\r\nfighting the war against terrorism. My country is happy\r\nto note the positive manner in which the work in this\r\nfield is progressing. We are encouraged by the\r\nconstructive work that is being carried out by the\r\nworking group on terrorism to finalize a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nWe are also looking forward to the early conclusion of\r\nthe proposed international convention for the\r\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism, which we\r\nbelieve will broaden and further strengthen the\r\ninternational legal regime. My delegation also supports\r\nthe early convening of the high-level conference, under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations, to formulate a\r\njointly organized response of the international\r\ncommunity to terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nTo us in the Maldives, any terrorist attack\r\nanywhere brings back memories of the carnage caused\r\nby terrorists in the Maldives in November 1988. Every\r\nyear since that time, my delegation has addressed this\r\nAssembly on the need for effective and timely\r\ninternational cooperation to combat and eliminate\r\nterrorism, which is almost always transnational in\r\nnature. In an age of globalization and high finance, our\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nvigilance against terrorism and organized crime has to\r\nbe stepped up.\r\nFollowing our own tragic experience as a victim\r\nof terrorism, we have strengthened out national legal\r\nframework to counter terrorism. Under our Anti-\r\nTerrorism Law of 1990, I am happy to report that we\r\nhave enabled ourselves to be in full compliance with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1333 (2000) and 1373\r\n(2001). We have taken measures, such as those called\r\nfor in resolutions 1333 (2000) and 1373 (2001), so that\r\nno activities can be undertaken in the Maldives to\r\nsupport terrorist acts. Our laws ensure that no terrorist\r\ncan find safe haven on our shores and that terrorists\r\ncannot enter the Maldives, let alone undertake any\r\nactivities in the Maldives. We have acceded to the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings, along with seven other\r\ninternational conventions on terrorism. We are now\r\ncompleting the process of signing the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism.\r\nAs in the past, my delegation would also like to\r\nassert that terrorism is linked to a wide network of\r\norganized crime. We must therefore target not only\r\nterrorists, but all those who assist terrorists and benefit\r\nfrom terrorist activities. Quite often, those who\r\nsmuggle arms and launder funds from the illicit trade\r\nin narcotics operate hand in hand with terrorists.\r\nSimilarly, mercenaries who provide training and supply\r\nweapons of terror also pose a serious threat to peace\r\nand security. In this regard, we believe that it is high\r\ntime that the international community give serious\r\nthought to ratifying the International Convention\r\nagainst the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training\r\nof Mercenaries as well.\r\nThe important and positive role that regional\r\ncooperation can play in combating terrorism cannot be\r\noveremphasized. Increased interaction, consultation\r\nand cooperation at the regional level can pave the way\r\nto setting up effective security arrangements and legal\r\nframeworks that complement efforts at the international\r\nlevel. In South Asia, a region that understands the\r\ndestructive effects of terrorism, a regional Convention\r\non the Suppression of Terrorism is presently in force.\r\nUnder the provisions of the Convention, States\r\nmembers of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC) are committed to extraditing or\r\nprosecuting terrorists, thus preventing them from\r\nenjoying safe haven. A Terrorist Offences Monitoring\r\nDesk also functions under SAARC with the aim of\r\ncollecting, analysing and disseminating information on\r\nincidents of terrorism, along with tactics, strategies and\r\nmethods used by terrorists. However, a lot more\r\nremains to be done if we are to have an impact on\r\nterrorism in our region.\r\nMy delegation would like to compliment the\r\nSecurity Council for the prompt manner in which the\r\nhorrifying attacks on the United States were\r\ncondemned and for quickly acting under Chapter VII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, detailing measures to be\r\ntaken by the world community to combat terrorism. In\r\na global village, an attack against one is an attack\r\nagainst all, especially where the fundamental tenets of\r\ncivilization come under attack. My country has long\r\nvalued and stressed the importance of the Declaration\r\non the Principles of International Law concerning\r\nFriendly Relations and Cooperation among States,\r\nadopted by the United Nations in October 1970 in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations,\r\ncontained in General Assembly resolution 2625\r\n(XXV). Adherence to these Principles is so crucial to\r\nthe peace, security and well-being of small States, such\r\nas the Maldives. In a globalized world, the observance\r\nof these Principles is of profound importance indeed to\r\nall States, big and small.\r\nOur aim is to live in a more peaceful world, one\r\nwhere the small shall feel as secure as the mighty and\r\nwhere the fruits of human labour and ingenuity are not\r\ndestroyed by wanton acts of barbarism. Never before\r\nhas the international community come together to\r\nspeak in one voice, as it has now, to condemn the\r\nsenseless and brutal murder of so many people. We\r\nmust seize the moment to ensure that such a tragedy is\r\nnever allowed to occur again. We stand shoulder to\r\nshoulder with the world community in doing our\r\nutmost to this end.\r\nMr. Kawah (Liberia): Over the past three weeks,\r\nwe have concentrated on the matter of terrorism to a\r\ndegree which is unprecedented, not only here at the\r\nUnited Nations but throughout the entire world. This\r\nhigh degree of attention, as many have observed, is\r\nprincipally the result of the wave of terrorism recently\r\nperpetrated on the United States of America and the\r\nAmerican people, which has caused an immeasurable\r\nloss of innocent life, acute fear and suffering, and\r\neconomic dislocation and downturn throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nTerrorism is not a new phenomenon; however, it\r\nis changing in its scope, parameters and scale. It has\r\nreached a new level of viciousness and insidiousness; it\r\nhas reawakened fear and vulnerability within us\r\nbecause of its senselessness and because we cannot\r\nrationalize or comprehend it.\r\nWe sit here deliberating only a brief distance\r\nfrom the site of one of the greatest crimes ever inflicted\r\non civilization, a crime that threatens to tear apart our\r\nspirit and our vision of a better world. The United\r\nNations is now called upon to draw upon its great\r\nreserves of resolve so as to eliminate the scourge of\r\nhumankind that has brought death and sorrow to so\r\nmany of God’s children. We must respond together to\r\nthe call. All of us have a stake in the outcome of this\r\nstruggle.\r\nLiberia is a small nation with big problems: we\r\nhave been torn apart by a long civil war, we are\r\nsuffering as a result of the ongoing conflicts that\r\nsurround us and we are beset by internal political strife.\r\nYet we hold onto a clear vision that we, too, must\r\ncontribute our voice and support to world efforts to rid\r\nall peoples and cultures of the threat of ignorance and\r\nevil.\r\nTerrorism can be allowed no part of our collective\r\nfuture. Even as we speak, small groups of self-\r\nappointed rebels are challenging, with arms, the\r\nstability and progress of our fragile Liberian\r\ndemocratic system. They bring death, destruction and\r\nanarchy, not truth or enlightenment. Now is the time to\r\ncall a halt to terrorism, with its corrosive effect on our\r\nsocial and religious foundations.\r\nIn their grief and shock over the events of\r\n11 September, the Americans have issued a call to all\r\nof us to join in a common effort to eliminate the\r\nelements among us that would destroy our values, kill\r\nour innocents and impose fear on our lives. The nations\r\nhere must unite to prevent even transient success for\r\nthose elements.\r\nMy Government has already expressed to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica its profound regret, as well as its horror and\r\ndisbelief, at the cold-blooded murder of so many of its\r\ncitizens that took place on 11 September. As President\r\nTaylor said,\r\n“We share the sorrow and distress of the suffering\r\nAmerican people. In the name of humanity, love\r\nand affection, which have no boundaries, we\r\nidentify with you and share your anxiety”.\r\nFor many years now, terrorism has been growing\r\nat an alarming rate and has visited every Member of\r\nthis Organization. In recognition of the need to combat\r\nthis scourge, world leaders, in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, committed themselves to\r\n“take concerted action against international\r\nterrorism, and to accede as soon as possible to all\r\nthe relevant international conventions.”\r\n(resolution 55/2, para. 9)\r\nEqually important is adherence to those conventions.\r\nTo this end, the Government of Liberia has instructed\r\nme to sign the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings.\r\nAt the thirty-fifth ordinary session of the\r\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), held in Algiers,\r\nAlgeria, in July 1999, the OAU adopted a Convention\r\non the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism. This\r\nConvention explicitly acknowledges the fact that\r\nterrorism constitutes a serious violation of human\r\nrights, in particular of the rights to physical integrity,\r\nlife, freedom and security, and that it impedes socio-\r\neconomic development through the destabilization of\r\nStates. It concludes that political, philosophical,\r\nideological, racial, ethnic or other motives can never be\r\nused in justification or defence of terrorist acts.\r\nToday, the peoples of the entire world — not only\r\nthose of the United States and other developed\r\ncountries — face personal and collective dangers from\r\nthis new wave of terrorism from lone individuals or\r\nsmall groups of people who, for personal, selfish and\r\nparochial reasons bring untold tragedy to the lives of\r\nother people by committing unspeakable acts of\r\nviolence.\r\nIn discussing such manifestations of terrorism\r\nand United Nations plans for dealing with this\r\naffliction, this gathering should remember that,\r\nalthough such plans are essential in the short term, in\r\nthe longer term our Organization must not lose sight of\r\nthe underlying causes of terrorism. In this respect, we\r\nare still shrouded in a considerable fog of ignorance,\r\nand sometimes of denial.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nWe believe that the root cause of these nefarious\r\nacts is the lack of a proper balance between the liberty\r\nof the individual or group of individuals, and the needs\r\nof society in general. It has been said that\r\n“Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of\r\npropriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his\r\nstation. It debaseth him to the level of extreme\r\ndepravity and wickedness.” (Kitab-i-Aqdas, verse\r\n123)\r\nWe must reconcile ourselves to the fact that the liberty\r\nof individuals or groups of individuals to act as they\r\nwish can never be absolute.\r\nIn our search for solutions and remedy, we must\r\nacknowledge that peace, security and the well-being of\r\nmankind will not be obtainable unless and until global\r\nunity is firmly established. What we need to develop\r\namong mankind is genuine respect for humanity. This\r\nis the goal we should pursue, and, once it is achieved,\r\nthe fierce nationalism and parochial interests that\r\nunderlie, or are used as justification for, acts of terror\r\nwill be undermined. In short, we should develop a\r\nsense of world citizenship. Accordingly, the oneness of\r\nmankind should become a conscious goal of our\r\npolitical, educational and religious life. Every nation,\r\nrace, religion, sect or tribe should have its rightful\r\nplace in this global village. Globalization must\r\nmanifest itself in equity, true universality and purity of\r\nself, and divest itself of nationalistic and exploitative\r\ntrappings.\r\nIn condemning all acts of terrorism, the Liberian\r\nGovernment, in conjunction with other nations of the\r\nworld, supports the initiatives of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, including the call for a high-level\r\nconference on international terrorism, held under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, to focus on the total\r\nelimination of acts of war launched by terrorists the\r\nworld over.\r\nThe conclusion of such a conference should be to\r\nuniversally condemn every act of terrorism, be it\r\ncommitted by ally or foe; create an international\r\ncooperation centre; make economic opportunities and\r\ndevelopment available to and possible for all; identify\r\nthe causes of despair and poverty and act upon that\r\nknowledge; continue to acknowledge the diversity of\r\ncustoms and religion and to recognize economic\r\ndisparities; ensure that the helpless and innocent do not\r\nsuffer; and ensure full respect for all international\r\nconventions so that no nation, large or small, abandons\r\nbasic principles of law.\r\nLiberia stands ready to do its part to defeat this\r\nmenace to our cherished norms of international\r\ninteraction that foster international trade, travel and\r\ncommerce. Furthermore, my Government is in full\r\nsupport of the anti-terrorism efforts of the United\r\nStates and other nations and unreservedly condemns all\r\nacts of terrorism, their perpetrators, organizers and\r\nsponsors. It is prepared to participate in any and all\r\nefforts to eliminate this crime from the face of the\r\nearth. In doing so, we must make certain that the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of this Organization\r\nare upheld.\r\nFinally, we must admit in all candour that it will\r\nbe impossible to eliminate terrorism unless, and until,\r\nsome sort of conscious consensus is reached on the\r\nnorms that would govern world unity and togetherness.\r\nAs has been said, “The earth is but one country, and\r\nmankind its citizens.”\r\nMr. Erdös (Hungary): Taking the floor after so\r\nmany speakers in this debate on terrorism, I fully\r\nrecognize that previous speakers have already covered\r\nthe multiple aspects of both how we all felt and how\r\nwe continue to feel about what happened on 11\r\nSeptember in New York City and other places in the\r\nUnited States and how the international community\r\nshould be waging an uncompromising struggle against\r\nthis deadly phenomenon of our times.\r\nHere at the United Nations, we have been\r\nspeaking for years about the many global problems that\r\ntranscend national borders and that affect each and\r\nevery one of us. Reference was made not just once to\r\ninternational terrorism as one of those global problems.\r\nAs time went by and events unfolded, it became ever\r\nmore obvious that no one could feel safe and secure in\r\nthe face of the many difficult issues that have left their\r\ndramatic imprints on life in the four corners of our\r\nglobalizing world. The barbaric acts of 11 September\r\nhave proven with elementary force that, in fact,\r\nterrorism knows no boundaries. Its horrifying\r\nconsequences show, as unambiguously as ever, the\r\ninterrelated nature of our societies. They demonstrate\r\nthat terrorist acts in one country can have wide-ranging\r\nrepercussions in many other parts of the world.\r\nAs has already been said many times in the last\r\nthree weeks, the terrorist strikes in this country are an\r\nattack against everything we all stand for, everything\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nwe believe in, and go against the very foundations of\r\nour civilization. I wish to reiterate my Government’s\r\nposition that there can be no justification whatsoever\r\nfor any kind of terrorist act.\r\nHungary fully supports the statement made by the\r\nEuropean Union in this debate. Combating terrorism\r\nmust become a priority objective of the international\r\ncommunity. Since this struggle will be a multifaceted\r\nand complex undertaking, we need the strongest\r\nresolve, unrelenting determination and effective\r\ncoordination within the community of nations. A global\r\ncoalition is imperative, where all nations act in unison\r\nand in the same cohesive spirit of purpose in order to\r\nprevent and to suppress the scourge of terrorism. This\r\nlarge coalition is emerging as we speak within the\r\nframework of the United Nations.\r\nWhat happened in New York City and elsewhere\r\nin this country in early September was a wake-up\r\ncall — perhaps the last wake-up call — for all of us at\r\nthe national, regional and international levels. We all\r\nhave been speaking about the threat of international\r\nterrorism. We have been witnessing its rampage across\r\nthe globe. There can be no doubt that we were taking\r\nvarious steps to counter its threat; yet, we were caught\r\nunprepared as we watched the horrible outburst of this\r\ncontemporary evil in our host city. By now, the\r\nquestion is not so much about choosing sides any more\r\nin this planetary fight against terrorists as it is about\r\nthe most effective ways to combat them.\r\nMr. Kamara (Sierra Leone), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe United Nations has not remained idle in the\r\nface of the September tragedy. The full solidarity of the\r\nworld community, including my own country, with the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States is on\r\npublic record. In the immediate aftermath of the\r\ntragedy, our world Organization, through the Security\r\nCouncil and General Assembly, reacted to the events\r\nwithout delay and in no uncertain terms. And the most\r\nrecent Security Council resolution is an integral part of\r\nthe emerging strategy to identify ways and means of\r\ntaking up the challenge of terrorism, this time with\r\nmore determination and consistency, including ongoing\r\nmonitoring activities. Part of this strategy should be the\r\ncompletion of work on the two draft international\r\nconventions on the suppression of nuclear terrorism\r\nand on international terrorism.\r\nThere might be many other ways to tackle this\r\nglobal enemy of humankind. Various other United\r\nNations entities, such as the Office for Drug Control\r\nand Crime Prevention in Vienna, multilateral\r\norganizations, such as Interpol and many others, all\r\nneed to have a second look at their strategies and action\r\nplans, which will have to be updated and better\r\ncoordinated in order to achieve maximum efficiency.\r\nSimultaneously, and no less importantly as a reflection\r\nof expected evolution in the multilateral field, the\r\ndevelopment of a harmonized network of national\r\nlegislative measures is also necessary.\r\nAware of the significance of regional and\r\ninternational cooperation, Hungary has concluded a set\r\nof bilateral treaties on terrorism with 28 States,\r\nincluding most of its neighbours. In 1996, Hungary\r\nacceded to the European Convention on the\r\nSuppression of Terrorism in the framework of the\r\nCouncil of Europe. Hungarian efforts in this field have\r\nalso been bolstered by ever-increasing cooperation\r\nwith the European Union. Equally, Hungary’s\r\nmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\nentails cooperation and the provision of concrete\r\nsupport in the collective fight against terrorism.\r\nHungary is also party to 10 of the 12 major\r\ninternational conventions pertaining to international\r\nterrorism. As regards the two remaining ones, on 7\r\nSeptember the Hungarian Parliament ratified the 1997\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings. The 1999 International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism will also be signed this year and ratified by\r\nour Parliament at an early date.\r\nThe Hungarian Parliament, in a resolution\r\nadopted in the wake of the terrorist attacks, called for\r\nthe further development of international law in the\r\nstruggle against global terrorism. Hungary believes that\r\nefforts in this direction must be intensified. Regarding\r\nthe two as yet unfinished international conventions\r\nrelated to terrorism, my country is looking forward to a\r\nconstructive discussion on the text of the draft\r\nconvention on the suppression of nuclear terrorism and\r\nbelieves that the time has come for speedy finalization,\r\non a priority basis, of the draft on a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism.\r\nWe have to recognize that this vast strategy of\r\ncombating the terrorist threat contains several\r\ninterdisciplinary elements. The struggle to defeat\r\nterrorism must be an overarching theme in the whole\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nspectrum of human activities, in the fields of\r\ndiplomacy, security, the judiciary, intelligence and in\r\nfinancial, social, humanitarian and economic\r\nendeavours. For this struggle to be effective, adequate\r\nsolutions must be found to the many issues that create\r\ninstability and conflict and that are the breeding ground\r\nfor the phenomenon of terrorism. Each and every\r\nnation on Earth must feel, irrespective of its location\r\non the map and the level of its development, that it is a\r\ngenuine stakeholder in this fight, that this universal\r\nundertaking also responds to its national\r\npreoccupations and priorities.\r\nFinally, a strong alliance against terrorists implies\r\nmuch better coordination of our efforts to reach the\r\ngoals laid down in the Millennium Declaration. It\r\nimplies the most resolute rejection of suggestions of a\r\nclash among various religious beliefs and cultural\r\ntraditions. It also implies an unequivocal refusal of\r\ncheap demagoguery, nationalist extremism and racism,\r\nat a time when tolerance, mutual understanding, human\r\nsolidarity and openness must become, as importantly as\r\never, the guiding principles in our quest to create\r\nenlightened democratic and inclusive societies.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I am honoured at the outset to extend to Mr.\r\nHan our heartfelt congratulations on his election to the\r\npresidency of this important session of the General\r\nAssembly, which is being held in very unusual\r\ninternational circumstances. We are fully confident that\r\nhis wisdom and political expertise will contribute to\r\nthe success of our work.\r\nI wish on this occasion to express our thanks and\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor his report on this item, which will strengthen\r\ninternational endeavours to combat terrorism. I wish to\r\nshow my full support for the positions stated to the\r\nAssembly by my colleague the representative of Libya\r\nin his capacity as Chairman of the Arab Group.\r\nOn 11 September the entire world saw three grave\r\nattacks on America, in which thousands of its citizens\r\nwere killed. Citizens of 80 other countries who\r\nhappened to be at the sites where these barbaric attacks\r\noccurred were also killed. The perpetrators of these\r\ncriminal and regrettable acts, despite the fact that they\r\ndirectly targeted the city of New York — the United\r\nNations host city — as well as the sovereignty of the\r\nUnited States, with which the United Arab Emirates\r\nhas very unique friendly relations and solid historical\r\ninterests, have shown their real extremist face, which\r\nhas targeted not only the American people, but also\r\nother people who have expressed their solidarity with\r\nthe United States.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates, which was one of the\r\nfirst countries to express its heartfelt condolences to\r\nthe people and the Government of the United States\r\nand the families of the victims of these brutal attacks,\r\nwhich we strongly condemn, determined from the\r\nmoment of the attacks to cooperate in the exchange of\r\ninformation and to fully support all American\r\nendeavours in the fight against terrorism, in pursuing\r\nthe perpetrators and in bringing them to justice. We\r\nhave cut off diplomatic relations with the Taliban\r\nGovernment, since it has not responded to the will of\r\nthe international community, which has called for it to\r\nsurrender Osama bin Laden to face a fair international\r\ntrial for the indictments against him in the attacks on\r\nthe United States and in compliance with Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), adopted last Friday.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has taken some\r\nrigorous measures to stop attempts to finance terrorism,\r\nincluding announcing a list of individuals and\r\norganizations that have ties to terrorist attacks, freezing\r\ntheir accounts, deposits and investments and imposing\r\npunitive measures on any individual conducting\r\ntransactions with these entities.\r\nThe position and action of the United Arab\r\nEmirates in this regard was neither a coincidence nor\r\nthe result of external pressures. It was the result of our\r\nabsolute belief in human justice and the importance of\r\njoining the international community to combat\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. This\r\nphenomenon has become one of the most important\r\ninternational challenges and threatens all humans\r\nregardless of creed, because of the growth and spread\r\nof criminal methods used by terrorists. This not only\r\ncauses the loss of innocent civilians and the destruction\r\nof public and private property, but also undermines the\r\nsecurity and the stability of States and their national\r\neconomies.\r\nIn condemning all terrorist practices, whatever\r\ntheir source or objective, we wish to emphasize that\r\ncombating this dangerous phenomenon that extends\r\nbeyond national and regional borders is a joint\r\ninternational responsibility. No State or region can face\r\nit alone. This requires primarily that the international\r\ncommunity find a framework for a comprehensive\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nstrategy to combat it, based on justice, balance and\r\ntransparency. We would like, as a priority, to find a\r\nclear and specific definition of terrorism that\r\ndistinguishes between criminal acts against innocent\r\ncivilians and their property and the interests and\r\nstability of countries and peoples, and between the\r\nlegitimate struggle of people under foreign domination\r\nor occupation for their liberation and self-\r\ndetermination, which is not considered a form of\r\nterrorism on the basis of the Charter, international law\r\nand resolutions of international legitimacy.\r\nWe consider State terrorism, which is practised\r\nby the Israeli Government against the Palestinian\r\npeople daily, to be the most dangerous kind of\r\ninternational terrorism. This includes the killing of\r\nthousands of innocent civilians, arbitrary arrests, the\r\nprevention of people’s movement and of the transport\r\nof food and medication, the confiscation of land, the\r\ndestruction of property and infrastructure and the\r\ndesecration of Islamic and Christian holy places. All of\r\nthis takes place in disregard of international law and\r\nrelevant resolutions of international legitimacy that\r\nprohibit collective terrorism against an entire people, in\r\naccordance with the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights and the Geneva Convention relative to the\r\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12\r\nAugust 1949.\r\nTherefore, we wish to draw the attention of the\r\ninternational community to the fact that the Israeli\r\nGovernment is trying to exploit the current unusual\r\nsituation, following the attacks against the United\r\nStates, to kill and maim and compel many Palestinians\r\nto emigrate from their land and end the legitimate\r\nresistance to bring about their liberation, independence\r\nand self-determination.\r\nLike other speakers, we wish to emphasize the\r\nneed to reach a just, comprehensive and lasting\r\nsettlement for the Palestinian question and the situation\r\nin the Middle East, which will put an end to frustration,\r\ndespair and extremist responses that are violent and\r\nthreaten not only the region, but the world as a whole.\r\nWe are very concerned about the purpose of biased and\r\nprovocative mass media campaigns and modern\r\ncommunications networks deployed against Arabs and\r\nMuslims, which have caused hundreds of them to\r\nsuffer bodily, financial and moral harm as institutions,\r\nindividuals and groups living abroad.\r\nWe insist that international efforts be\r\nstrengthened to put an end to these racist acts, which\r\nwe consider terroristic, against Arabs and Muslims.\r\nThis is a form of cultural and civilizational\r\nconfrontation, which will only lead to hostility between\r\npeoples and nations and heat up hot spots and cause\r\ninsecurity and instability all over the world.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to emphasize the\r\nimportant role of the United Nations in any\r\narrangements or international plan to combat terrorism\r\nwithin the context of the conventions and protocols\r\ndealing with all forms of combating terrorism, the most\r\nimportant of which is the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In that\r\nregard, we urge the international community to respond\r\nto the proposals made by some Arab leaders and the\r\nleaders of the Non-Aligned Movement in favour of\r\nholding an international conference under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations. This would contribute to\r\nproviding a complete and joint response to combat\r\nterrorism politically, technologically and legally. This\r\nwill finally put an end to this evil, which is threatening\r\nnot only our present economic, cultural and human\r\nwealth, but also our future generations.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation would like at the outset to associate itself\r\nwith the statement made by His Excellency the\r\nPermanent Representative of the Socialist People’s\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya on behalf of the Arab Group\r\nin the United Nations.\r\nThe General Assembly is discussing today an\r\nissue that truly touches upon the essence of\r\ninternational relations and the interests of States,\r\nnations, peoples and religions. The discussion should\r\ntherefore be objective and constructive so we can reach\r\na common position that deals with the core of the\r\nproblem before us. All this must be done without\r\npressure, blackmail, exploitation, hegemony,\r\ndomination and unilateral action.\r\nIt is clear that the current discussion is a result of\r\nthe events that took place in the United States on 11\r\nSeptember 2001, which led to the death of a large\r\nnumber of victims. This raises a number of questions\r\nthat require all of us to think responsibly, while\r\nremaining resolutely faithful to the responsibilities that\r\nwe shoulder under the Charter.\r\nThe United Nations and other regional and\r\ninternational organizations have made continuous and\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\ntireless efforts since 1972 to deal with the issue of\r\nterrorism. This has resulted in a number of\r\ninternational conventions and agreements on various\r\ntypes of actions that deal with several aspects of the\r\nquestion. But we should recall that these efforts have\r\nregrettably still not even led to an agreement on a clear\r\ndefinition of terrorism, and that the matter is still\r\nsubject to political opinions, speculations and interests.\r\nOn the other hand, we should also recall that the\r\ndiscussion of this issue within this Organization has\r\nbeen linked from the beginning with the necessity of\r\nstudying the roots of the problem and the reasons that\r\nlie behind committing such actions, which are to be\r\ncombated. And we support combating them. We should\r\nall admit to the great shortcomings in this area.\r\nToday’s world suffers from a number of negative\r\nphenomena. We are witnessing global suffering,\r\nespecially in the third world — the countries of the\r\nSouth — because of political coercion, economic and\r\npolitical blackmail, the use of force and aggression, the\r\nunilateral conduct of international relations, the law of\r\nmight rather than the rule of law and the distinction\r\namong peoples and communities on the basis of their\r\ncultural, ethnic and religious origins. All these factors\r\ncontribute to creating dangerous elements that arouse\r\nthe worst of feelings and approaches to combating\r\ninjustice and tyranny.\r\nMy country, Iraq, has suffered and is still\r\nsuffering from acts of terrorism, including State\r\nterrorism under different names. Consequently, we\r\nunderstand, and we are deeply aware of, the\r\nconsequences of such acts that cause suffering and\r\nsacrifices among innocent people. This was our feeling\r\ntowards the loss of civilian victims as a result of the\r\nexplosions in the United States recently. We did not\r\nrejoice or gloat at what happened, as some Zionist\r\ncircles or some in the mass media have said, in a clear\r\nattempt at provocation.\r\nThe Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Tariq Aziz, sent\r\npersonal letters of condolence to some prominent\r\nAmerican figures, who had expressed sympathy for the\r\npeople of Iraq when they lost hundreds of thousands of\r\ninnocent victims as a result of acts of terrorism, which\r\nthe United States and the United Kingdom have been\r\nundertaking against Iraq since August 1990. In these\r\nletters, the Deputy Prime Minister expressed\r\ncondolences to the bereaved families of the victims and\r\nto every honourable American citizen who has shown\r\nsolidarity with the people of Iraq in their plight.\r\nIraq has, to date, lost more than 1.6 million of its\r\ninnocent children, women and the elderly as a result of\r\nthe continued unjust sanctions and the siege imposed\r\nby the United States through the Security Council on\r\nIraq. The United States has striven, and continues to\r\nstrive, to maintain sanctions by every means. Iraq has\r\nlost thousands of innocent civilians as a result of the\r\nmilitary terrorist acts that have been carried out by the\r\nUnited States and the United Kingdom against the\r\npeople of Iraq from 17 January 1991 until now.\r\nMoreover, the last American-British aggression\r\nagainst Iraq occurred the day before yesterday and\r\nkilled two civilians in the city of Basra. Furthermore,\r\nthe large devastation caused by these barbaric attacks\r\nwas directed against every sector of life and the whole\r\ninfrastructure of Iraq, including schools, hospitals,\r\nfactories, residential neighbourhoods, streets, bridges,\r\nmosques, churches, water sanitation plants, sewage\r\nplants, electricity plants and oil refineries. American\r\nmissiles did not spare even the graveyards.\r\nDuring the 1991 aggression against Iraq, the\r\nUnited States and the United Kingdom deliberately\r\ncontaminated the environment by using depleted\r\nuranium. This caused a tenfold increase in cancer cases\r\ncompared with 1990 figures.\r\nThe United States far surpassed those terrorist\r\nacts against Iraq by adopting what it called the Iraq\r\nLiberation Act, which included specific provisions on\r\norganizing, financing and supporting terrorist acts\r\naimed at attaining an illegitimate goal in violation of\r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nall conventions and norms governing international\r\nrelations: that goal was for a foreign Power to change\r\nthe political system of Iraq by force. Under that act, the\r\nUnited States has set aside nearly $100 million, $97\r\nmillion to be exact. Under that national legislation, the\r\nUnited States is training groups of mercenaries — who\r\nonce bore Iraqi nationality — on military bases in the\r\nUnited States in order to prepare them to be sent into\r\nIraq to carry out terrorist operations in our cities. These\r\nwould include bombings and assassinations and would\r\nbe aimed at the political destabilization of Iraq.\r\nBut it is not only the United States and the United\r\nKingdom that are doing such things. Other countries\r\ntoo are carrying out armed terrorism against Iraq by\r\norganizing, supporting and financing terrorists who\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nsneak over the border to engage in sabotage,\r\nassassinations and bombings within Iraq.\r\nIn another sphere, I must mention the acts of the\r\nIsraeli authorities in Palestine and in the occupied Arab\r\nterritories, with direct support and financing from the\r\nUnited States and with that country’s unequivocal\r\ninternational protection. These include targeted\r\nassassinations, the mass murder of the people,\r\ndisplacement of the people, the imposition of siege,\r\npreventing the delivery of food, destroying houses,\r\nbulldozing farms, bombing cities and villages with\r\nhigh-technology United States weaponry, and the use\r\nof depleted-uranium munitions and poison gas. By any\r\ninternational standard, those acts are organized\r\nterrorism against an entire population whose land has\r\nbeen looted and whose rights have been ignored. It will\r\ntake a serious, broad-based international effort to put\r\nan end to this organized terrorism and to bring justice\r\nto the Palestinian people.\r\nWhat is happening in Palestine is happening also\r\nin many other parts of the world, especially in the\r\nthird-world countries of Africa, Latin America and\r\nAsia.\r\nIn that connection, Iraq has explicitly stated its\r\nposition in two internationally disseminated letters\r\nfrom His Excellency President Saddam Hussein, dated\r\n15 September and 18 September 2001, which make\r\nreference to these facts. Their purpose is simply to\r\nencourage the United States to act responsibly, wisely,\r\nrationally, foresightedly and fairly, and to carry out a\r\ncomprehensive review of its domestic and foreign\r\npolicy in order to identify ways to guarantee the\r\nsecurity and stability of the United States and of the\r\ninternational community at large, and not to act on an\r\nunbridled wish to incite hatred, chauvinism and a\r\ncrusader mentality aimed at retaliating against an\r\nunknown enemy, or to exploit the attacks as a cover for\r\nsettling old scores against any particular nation,\r\nreligion or Arab or Islamic country.\r\nThose letters were intended to remind United\r\nStates politicians of the need for a comprehensive\r\nreview of what their country’s political and economic\r\nsystem represents in terms of oppression and\r\naggression against United States citizens belonging to\r\nethnic or religious minorities and against millions of\r\nother poor Americans, and of what United States policy\r\nstands for in the eyes of the world in terms of\r\nhegemony, slavery and the denial of rights and\r\nlegitimate aspirations and interests, and to call upon\r\nthem to make use of the means provided by\r\ninternational law, which is the core duty of State\r\nleaders who act responsibly and who are interested in a\r\nworld order that is just and fair, and that does not\r\ninclude the elimination of peoples or economic\r\nblockades against peoples, which deprive them of their\r\nbasic human rights. Under such a world order,\r\neveryone would enjoy peace and security and would\r\nshare equally and fairly in humanitarian values.\r\nIn a statement issued on 22 September 2001, His\r\nExcellency President Saddam Hussein explicitly called\r\nupon the United States to act with justice and to make\r\nnumerous, broad friendships as it did in the past. It\r\nwould then find its circle of friends enlarging and\r\nexpanding.\r\nFighting terrorism requires, first and foremost,\r\nagreement on the definition of terrorism. We need a\r\nclear definition that is neither misleading nor vague so\r\nthat it cannot be distorted to gain political advantage,\r\nto punish acts that are unrelated to terrorism, or to\r\nignore obvious terrorist acts.\r\nArab States were the first to offer initiatives in\r\nthe United Nations to combat terrorism; they have been\r\ndoing so since 1972. These have met with broad\r\ninternational understanding and have been ratified at\r\nsummit meetings of the Non-Aligned Movement, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and other\r\nintergovernmental organizations. This is reflected in\r\nthe adoption of the Arab Convention on the\r\nSuppression of Terrorism, the Convention of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference on Combating\r\nInternational Terrorism and the Organization of African\r\nUnity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of\r\nTerrorism.\r\nHere, I want to reaffirm the natural inalienable\r\nright of all peoples struggling against foreign\r\noccupation, colonial domination and aggression in all\r\nits military and economic forms to counter the\r\naggression they face and to stand up against sanctions\r\nand exploitation. That right is set out in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and in agreed conventions and\r\nnorms of international law. The legitimate struggle of\r\nthe Palestinian people against occupation, terrorism and\r\nZionist aggression cannot be considered terrorism. Nor\r\ncan the legitimate struggle of the peoples of the world\r\nagainst United States siege and embargo and against\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nUnited States and United Kingdom colonial aggression\r\nbe viewed as terrorism.\r\nThe issue of terrorism is multifaceted and\r\nmultidimensional. It requires a joint endeavour by the\r\ninternational community if it is to be resolved in\r\naccordance with international law and the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, and not in accordance with\r\nindividual interests, advantages or the exigencies of a\r\ngiven situation.\r\nThis must include all acts of violence, whether\r\nperpetrated by individuals or by States, carried out in\r\nviolation of international law. These acts include settler\r\noccupation and settler colonialism; the unilateral use of\r\nforce; aggression and interference in the internal affairs\r\nof States; the training, financing and arming of military\r\ngroups with a view to destabilizing the internal security\r\nof States; the provoking of separatist and ethnic and\r\nreligious conflicts; economic and social pressures;\r\ncultural and religious repression; mass murder; the use\r\nof prohibited weapons; the imposition of starvation\r\npolicies; and attempts to deprive certain States of the\r\nright to technical, cultural and scientific advancements\r\nand development. Let us not forget, either, the resort by\r\ncertain countries to the use of threats, blackmail and\r\nbribery to set some nations against each other.\r\nFinally, every act that violates international law is\r\na form of terrorism, whether carried out by an\r\nindividual, an organization or a State. No action carried\r\nout in accordance with international law as it was\r\nbefore the American hegemony of the world should be\r\nconsidered to be terrorism.\r\nMr. Baialinov (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic,\r\nmay I extend our most sincere condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States and to\r\nthe relatives and loved ones of those who died or were\r\ninjured in the unprecedented terrorist acts that took\r\nplace in this country. The people of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic deeply mourn the many innocent victims of\r\nthis loathsome act. Those who perpetrate and\r\nencourage such cruel and hateful acts can never be\r\nforgiven.\r\nWe also express our condolences to Israel and\r\nRussia, which also have apparently lost citizens to a\r\nterrorist act against a Russian TU-154 plane that was\r\nflying from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk.\r\nThese tragic events demonstrate once again that\r\nterrorism knows no national borders. Kyrgyzstan has\r\nalways condemned, and continues to condemn,\r\ninternational terrorism and extremism in all of its\r\nmanifestations and continues to advocate a\r\nstrengthening of international cooperation to combat\r\nthis global scourge, in order to prevent such acts from\r\nhappening again.\r\nIn his statement of 25 September 2001, the\r\nPresident of Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Askar Akayev, expressed\r\nthe country’s readiness to make available its airspace\r\nfor the conduct of anti-terrorist operations in\r\nAfghanistan. Kyrgyzstan is also prepared to discuss\r\nany other form of assistance and cooperation.\r\nOur country has taken a firm stance with regard\r\nto international terrorism, extremism and drug\r\ntrafficking. The international community must combat\r\nthese evils — which have no specific national or\r\nreligious origins — until they are eradicated.\r\nThe President emphasized that our country’s\r\nposition has always been clear-cut: the source of the\r\nthreat to security in the region has always been and\r\nremains Afghanistan and the Taliban regime, from\r\nwhich have emerged drug trafficking, terrorism and\r\nreligious extremism, which today pose a tremendous\r\nthreat to the entire world. In the past three years, our\r\nregion has been confronted with these three sources of\r\ndestabilization. From the very outset, our President\r\nemphasized, we have been convinced that the only way\r\nto fight these three security threats is through the\r\ncollective efforts of the international community.\r\nCentral Asia has been at the forefront of the fight\r\nagainst international terrorism and religious extremism.\r\nIn 1999 and 2000, our Republic was forced to carry our\r\nbroad-scale actions in the south of the country in order\r\nto rout large bands of rebels who had invaded our\r\nterritory. We were able to deal with this threat through\r\nthe armed forces of our country, with military and\r\ntechnical assistance from Russia and with the support\r\nof neighbours.\r\nGuided not only by our own national interests but\r\nby those of other countries and regions affected by the\r\nthreat of terrorism, Kyrgyzstan has consistently and\r\nfirmly advocated collective efforts to combat\r\ninternational terrorism and religious extremism. We\r\nwelcome the calls made by the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community for collective action, which\r\nalready have been translated into concrete\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\norganizational measures. In this connection, Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), adopted last week,\r\nrepresents a step forward in our fight against terrorism.\r\nFor a campaign against international terrorism to\r\nbe effective, we need to present a united anti-terrorist\r\nfront that includes all continents, regions and countries.\r\nThat is why the Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n(CIS) established a CIS anti-terrorist centre, within the\r\nframework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,\r\nheadquartered in Bishkek. The Shanghai Convention\r\non Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism\r\nwas adopted within that same framework, and at that\r\nsame Centre, located in the capital of our country.\r\nThe establishment of such centres has been\r\nprompted by the fact that the threat of international\r\nterrorism is so great that global anti-terrorist centres\r\nare not enough: regional, subregional and local centres\r\nare also needed. Together, acting in coordination, they\r\ncan reach all regions of the world that have been\r\ninfected by the deadly terrorist virus.\r\nThe forces of terrorism and religious extremism,\r\nin their fight against the civilized world, are acting in\r\nclose coordination with those of the drug world, which\r\nis using Central Asia as a major transhipment point for\r\nsending drugs to Russia and further on to the West.\r\nTherefore a joint campaign of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole against drug trafficking would\r\nrepresent a direct blow to terrorism, and vice versa.\r\nAn important element of the mechanism of such a\r\ncampaign is the conduct of global investigations into\r\nillicit international drug activity, which would allow us,\r\nin a timely manner, to identify organized criminal\r\ngroups and provide States Members of the United\r\nNations and the international community with reliable\r\ndata and analyses on the activities of transnational\r\ncriminal organizations.\r\nInternational terrorism today is not only a\r\npowerful military organization relying on mobile, very\r\nwell armed criminals acting stealthily and\r\ntreacherously; it also relies on subversion, ideological\r\nsubterfuge, religious extremism and the fomenting of\r\ninter-ethnic conflicts.\r\nA focal point for the ideology of international\r\nterrorism in Central Asia has now become the Hizbut\r\nTahrir party, established in 1953 in Palestine. Since\r\n1995 that party has begun to extend its activities to the\r\nterritory of Central Asia, including Kyrgyzstan.\r\nWe must fight these criminals with weapons, but\r\nwe must also combat religious extremism and\r\nfanaticism through the force of persuasion and\r\neducation. True Islam is a humanitarian faith, one of\r\neternal truths and high moral values. Those who put\r\nforward harmful ideas are heretics of Islam.\r\nThere is yet another particular feature in Central\r\nAsia. As has been repeatedly pointed out by the\r\nPresident of Kyrgyzstan, our opponents have one major\r\npotential ally within our countries: that is, poverty and\r\nunemployment. They are in fact the major breeding\r\ngrounds of all types of extremism. From this\r\nstandpoint, it is extremely important for the entire\r\ninternational community to make every effort to root\r\nout that evil.\r\nAs has been repeatedly emphasized from this\r\nrostrum, we can put an end to terrorism only through\r\nthe collective efforts of the international community to\r\nestablish a global system of measures to combat its\r\nthreats and challenges.\r\nMr. Andino Salazar (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr.\r\nHan on his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. I wish him and the\r\nother members of the Bureau every success in carrying\r\nout their mission, especially since their term comes at\r\nthe time of an exceptionally difficult and complex\r\ninternational situation arising from the terrorist acts\r\nthat occurred in the United States. These circumstances\r\nwill again test the capacity and readiness of the United\r\nNations and its Member States to live up to the\r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter,\r\nparticularly with regard to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAs the representative of Chile put it, speaking on\r\nbehalf of the Rio Group, we reiterate the importance\r\nfor the General Assembly to adopt concrete decisions\r\nat the conclusion of this debate that complement the\r\nmeasures already adopted in the fight against terrorism.\r\nAt the unilateral level and jointly with the rest of\r\nthe Central American countries, the people and\r\nGovernment of El Salvador, in the declaration on\r\nCentral America united against terrorism, have\r\ndemonstrated their solidarity with and grief for the\r\npeople and Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica, categorically condemning the acts of\r\nterrorism and expressing the firm resolve to cooperate\r\nin and support the adoption and implementation of\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nmeasures aimed at punishing those responsible, in\r\naccordance with the norms of international law. We\r\nfully support and offer all our cooperation in the\r\nimplementation of measures recommended at the\r\nhemispheric level and in the provisions of General\r\nAssembly resolution 56/1 and, in particular, of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001),\r\nwhich call on us to recognize the need and to decide on\r\nmeasures to enhance international cooperation to\r\nprevent, suppress and eliminate terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations.\r\nOn behalf of the people and Government of El\r\nSalvador, I reiterate the expressions of solidarity, grief\r\nand support for the people and Government of the\r\nUnited States, in particular for the families of the\r\nvictims of these utterly odious terrorist acts, and our\r\nsupport for the right of the United States, as an\r\naggressed State, to adopt measures of legitimate\r\nindividual and collective self-defence to ensure the\r\nsecurity of its citizens, property and institutions. Those\r\nresponsible for the acts of 11 September must be\r\nbrought to justice, while every effort should be made\r\n— as Cardinal Edward Egan of New York said on 1\r\nOctober at the worldwide synod of bishops at the\r\nVatican — to avoid committing injustices against those\r\nwho had nothing to do with the attacks.\r\nActs of terrorism are not new to modern history.\r\nThey have been used in various forms and for various\r\nobjectives, justified by some and condemned by others.\r\nApart from any justification that might be sought and\r\nthe fact that such attacks are unanimously repudiated\r\nand condemned by society, most victims are innocent\r\npeople and the property and economic infrastructure\r\nthat are destroyed serve the progress and well-being of\r\npeoples.\r\nDuring the 1980s, Central America, and El\r\nSalvador in particular, suffered from armed conflict in\r\nwhich terrorist acts were part of the daily lives of our\r\npeople. The negative consequences of these acts\r\nincluded a heavy toll in human life, the destruction of\r\nthe economic infrastructure and constant anguish and\r\nuncertainty amongst our people in the face of violent\r\nacts that were liable to strike anywhere and at any\r\nmoment and in general, set back the country’s growth\r\nand development.\r\nThese and many other terrorist acts that have\r\noccurred in various countries and regions, along with\r\ntheir grave and tragic consequences for the people who\r\nhave endured them — be it within their borders, on the\r\nhigh seas or aboard aircraft — did not sufficiently elicit\r\nthe international community’s concern and\r\nunderstanding of what terrorism means for the\r\ndevelopment of peoples and for peaceful coexistence in\r\nmodern times.\r\nThe irrational and reprehensible terrorist acts\r\nagainst the people and Government of the United\r\nStates, the consequences of which touch many of our\r\ncountries, have aroused the widespread opinion and\r\nawareness that the scourge of terrorism, with its\r\ndanger, threat, scope and magnitude, must stand at the\r\nforefront of global debate. These acts have revealed the\r\nvulnerability of each and every member of the\r\ninternational community. As we face a challenge, the\r\nparticular features of which we are all familiar with,\r\nthe fight against and eradication of terrorism — as has\r\nbeen repeatedly noted in this debate — require\r\nresolute, firm and joint action on the part of the\r\ninternational community and the cooperation and full\r\nsupport of each and every Member of this Organization\r\nto combat a common enemy that is one of the most\r\ninhuman scourges inflicted upon our peoples at the\r\ndawn of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe know that the struggle against terrorism will\r\nbe neither easy nor swift. As we seek to eliminate it, it\r\nis important to note that a general view has evolved in\r\nfavour of implementing existing international\r\ninstruments, of considering new initiatives and of\r\nadopting national measures to promote and strengthen\r\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations.\r\nIn this respect, in accordance with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, El Salvador is committed to complying\r\nstrictly with international conventions on terrorism to\r\nwhich it is a State party. It is studying the other\r\nconventions on this issue to which it is not a party —\r\nincluding the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism — so that, in accordance with\r\nour relevant domestic legislation, we may accede to\r\nthem as soon as possible.\r\nIn the context of additional immediate steps that\r\nreflect the interest, resolve and commitment of the\r\nStates Members of our Organization, my Government\r\nsupports and urges the Ad Hoc Committee created by\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/210 to conclude its\r\nwork on the draft convention on the suppression of acts\r\nof nuclear terrorism and to start and conclude work as\r\nsoon as possible on the draft comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism, which will\r\ncomprehend and complement the international\r\ninstruments on terrorism. In this way, and in distinction\r\nfrom the 1994 Declaration and its 1996 follow-up on\r\nmeasures to eliminate international terrorism, we shall\r\nadopt an instrument with provisions binding on all\r\nStates to abstain from supporting, helping, organizing\r\nand protecting terrorists and from allowing them to use\r\ntheir national territories for terrorist purposes. India’s\r\nproposal, which we have considered on past occasions,\r\nis an excellent basis for accelerating the process of\r\nadopting that draft convention.\r\nSimilarly, the Government of El Salvador\r\nbelieves that, in the light of recent events, it is\r\nimportant that we once again consider the possibility of\r\nconvening a high-level conference — under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, the universally\r\nrecognized institution for coordinating the efforts of\r\nnations to attain common ends — to consider measures\r\nand new and additional machinery for the international\r\ncommunity’s effective struggle against terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm the\r\npolitical determination of the Government of El\r\nSalvador to cooperate, to the best of its abilities, in the\r\ninternational effort to combat terrorism. To that end,\r\nwe have adopted a package of measures at the domestic\r\nlevel, including improved checks and security\r\narrangements at our ports and airports, tighter controls\r\non the movement of people, particularly citizens of\r\ncountries that might contain radical groups affiliated\r\nwith terrorism, and investigations into the financial\r\nsystem so as to ensure that there are no bank accounts\r\ncontaining funds that might be used for terrorist\r\npurposes.\r\nFurthermore, in accordance with the\r\ncommitments contained in the Central American\r\ndeclaration against terrorism, the heads of State of the\r\nregion decided to convene extraordinary meetings of\r\nthe Central American Security Commission with the\r\nheads of the national civil police forces of Central\r\nAmerica and the Conference of the Armed Forces of\r\nCentral America. They also decide to study other\r\nrelevant national steps aimed at assisting in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nWe have also heeded the international appeal, at\r\nboth the hemispheric and the global levels, reaffirming\r\nour determination to provide support in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to mention\r\nthe fact that, from 25 to 28 September, a presidential\r\ncommission from El Salvador, headed by the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, María Eugenia Brizuela de Avila,\r\nand the Minister for Security and Governance,\r\nFrancisco Bertrand Galindo, visited Washington and\r\nNew York, the cities hardest hit by the terrorist acts, so\r\nthat they could directly express their solidarity with the\r\npeople and the Government of the United States, as\r\nwell as with the families of the victims, in particular\r\nthose from El Salvador. Their visit concluded with the\r\nplacing of a floral tribute, on the “Wall of Prayers” at\r\nBellevue hospital in New York, to the victims of the\r\nterrorist attacks.\r\nMr. Lancry (Israel): We have gathered this week\r\nto address a matter of the utmost urgency to the\r\ninternational community. On the morning of 11\r\nSeptember 2001, in the most devastating terror attack\r\nin history, a group of terrorists brought two towering\r\nsymbols of our host city crashing to the ground and\r\nwrought havoc on the streets of New York and\r\nWashington, D.C. Of course, that was not the first time\r\nthat civilians had been the direct target of violent\r\nattacks. Indeed, the deadly plague of terrorism has\r\nposed a grave threat to international peace and security\r\nfor decades. But the attacks of 11 September have\r\ndemonstrated, in the most dramatic and catastrophic\r\nway imaginable, the devastation terrorism can cause\r\nand the extent of its reach, if it is not aggressively\r\nconfronted wherever it may breed.\r\nThe people and the Government of Israel express\r\ntheir most profound condolences and heartfelt\r\nsympathy to the people of the United States and to all\r\nthose whose lives have been affected by these heinous\r\nattacks. We join the resounding chorus of voices that\r\nhave condemned this evil act in the harshest terms. The\r\nterrorists who destroyed the World Trade Center and\r\nflattened the west side of the Pentagon in Washington,\r\nD.C., shattered not only glass and steel, but the\r\nmisconception that terrorism is confined to remote\r\nareas of conflict and does not pose a global threat of\r\nthe highest order.\r\nThere are those who worry that terror cannot be\r\neliminated because it is elusive. It is true that those\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nwho are willing to sacrifice themselves to kill others\r\ncannot be deterred by ordinary means. But the war on\r\nterrorism can be won through the comprehensive,\r\nuncompromising and unrelenting determination of the\r\ninternational community. To ensure that this campaign\r\nsucceeds, we must bring our economic, legal, military\r\nand diplomatic might to bear, in a coordinated and\r\nlong-term international, regional and national effort.\r\nIsrael is encouraged by the recent far-reaching\r\nmeasures adopted by the Security Council in resolution\r\n1373 (2001). That resolution, which targets in\r\nparticular those who finance terrorists and support their\r\nactions, represents a crucial step in the war on\r\nterrorism. All States must act now to root out the\r\nterrorists operating in their territory and the\r\ninfrastructure that feeds them. International\r\nmechanisms of cooperation must continue to be\r\nexpanded and enhanced to ensure that terrorists and\r\ntheir supporters are held fully accountable for their\r\ncrimes. This means more than adopting and enforcing\r\ninternational legal mechanisms to combat terrorism. It\r\nmeans, above all, mustering the sustained political will\r\nrequired to eradicate all terrorism comprehensively and\r\nwithout compromise.\r\nThese measures must be accompanied by a broad\r\ncampaign, involving religious leaders, educators and\r\ncivil society, aimed at rooting out the incitement to\r\nhatred and violence that creates a breeding ground\r\nwhere murderous ideologies flourish. Now, more than\r\never, voices of tolerance and mutual respect must be\r\nheard, in particular from political, spiritual and\r\neducational leaders in positions of influence. Terrorists\r\nmust hear from their own societies that they will not be\r\ntolerated. They must learn that they cannot hide. They\r\nwill not find refuge. They will not be allowed to\r\ntrample upon the common values of humanity.\r\nThe principles of international law, and the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, which condemn all acts of terrorism,\r\nwhatever their form or motivation, as criminal and\r\nunjustifiable, must serve as a global call to action.\r\nTerrorism must be fought without exception, without\r\nhesitation and without fear.\r\nWhile most nations and peoples have lowered\r\ntheir flags in solidarity with America, some have raised\r\ntheir voices in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable\r\nand to artificially distinguish between one kind of\r\nterror and another. These apologists, by purporting to\r\nidentify the underlying causes of these attacks, not only\r\njustify, in effect, the heinous crimes of 11 September,\r\nbut lay the moral foundation for future attacks.\r\nThe United Nations has heard such statements\r\nbefore. We have heard those who claim that certain\r\ntypes of terrorism are acceptable and that some\r\ninnocent civilians are legitimate targets.\r\nThe United Nations must reaffirm today that there\r\nis no justification, and that there can never be any\r\njustification, for the calculated murder of innocents.\r\nLet us be clear: the indiscriminate murder of innocent\r\ncivilians to advance political or religious objectives is\r\nterrorism, no matter how its apologists seek to label it.\r\nAs the Secretary-General declared on Monday,\r\nand has emphasized on previous occasions,\r\n“There can be no acceptance of those who would\r\nseek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent\r\ncivilian life, regardless of cause or grievance. If\r\nthere is one universal principle that all peoples\r\ncan agree on, surely it is that.” (A/56/PV.12)\r\nFabricating distinctions between different types\r\nof terror, though conveniently couched in the language\r\nof noble ideals, is an unforgivable insult to the\r\nmemories of those who have perished. There has never\r\nbeen a terrorist group that did not believe that the ends\r\njustify the means. These ends are typically articulated\r\nin terms of rights — but rights without any\r\ncorresponding responsibilities, so-called rights that\r\npermit indiscriminate murder with impunity, so-called\r\nrights that clearly defy unequivocal legal obligations\r\nand historical commitments.\r\nBut the thousands of innocents butchered in the\r\nname of these ideals tell a different story, and the moral\r\nof that story is clear: terrorism is defined by what one\r\ndoes, not by what one does it for. By bestowing any\r\nmeasure of legitimacy on terrorist tactics, those\r\nextremists who seek to achieve their goals through\r\nviolence will be empowered at the expense of leaders\r\nwilling to resolve disputes through peaceful dialogue.\r\nIf the international community tolerates any act of\r\nterrorism, it renders irrelevant the very methods it has\r\nchampioned for the peaceful resolution of disputes.\r\nThe renewed determination of the international\r\ncommunity to combat terrorism is welcome. But, at this\r\ncritical juncture, it is essential that the alliance against\r\nterror manage to clearly identify and recognize its foe.\r\nDefeating terror means far more than finding and\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\npunishing its immediate perpetrators. Terrorists do not\r\noperate in a vacuum, but rather as part of a complex\r\nnetwork whose constituent parts nourish and inspire\r\neach other, both organizationally and ideologically. The\r\nsuccess of a terrorist group in wreaking havoc in one\r\nsociety makes it easier for other groups to sow fear and\r\npanic elsewhere.\r\nTerrorist groups do not present a discrete series of\r\nthreats. They are not distinct entities that can be\r\ntoppled one by one. On the contrary, terrorism is\r\norganic, and the attempt to tackle one branch while\r\nexpressing sympathy or understanding for another will\r\nonly undermine our efforts. The terrorist organism, like\r\nany organism, cannot survive for long without systems\r\nto sustain it. Terrorists rely on an extensive\r\ninfrastructure that provides the financial means, the\r\nsuicidal indoctrination and the murderous tools with\r\nwhich to carry out attacks. And this infrastructure can\r\nonly exist with the assistance and complicity of States.\r\nCertain regimes in the Middle East and elsewhere\r\nhave granted terrorists safe harbour, supplied them with\r\nweapons and training grounds and provided the\r\nfinancial backing for the perpetration of thousands of\r\nattacks on innocent civilians. Through their support,\r\nboth active and tacit, these regimes have declared\r\nthemselves the allies of terrorism and bear no less\r\nresponsibility than the terrorists themselves.\r\nIf the resources and determination of the\r\ninternational community can be galvanized to eliminate\r\nState support for terrorism, a decisive blow will have\r\nbeen struck in this battle. But there can be no neutrality\r\nin this effort. Those States that fail to comply with their\r\nlegal obligations to suppress terrorists operating in\r\ntheir territory are not neutral — they are collaborators\r\nand must be regarded as such.\r\nSince Israel’s establishment, its citizens have\r\nbeen the targets of countless terrorist attacks. This past\r\nyear, Israel has been compelled to engage in legitimate\r\nself-defence against an indiscriminate and suicidal\r\nterrorist campaign that erupted in blatant violation of\r\nsigned agreements and that has claimed hundreds of\r\ninnocent lives.\r\nThe people of Israel are all too familiar with the\r\nattempts of terrorists and their allies to justify the\r\nmurder of civilians and blame the victims for their\r\ncrimes. But in the words of the Mayor of New York\r\nCity, who addressed us at the outset of this debate,\r\n“The era of moral relativism between those\r\nwho practice or condone terrorism, and those\r\nnations who stand up against it, must end.”\r\nHistory has shown the world that all that is\r\nrequired for evil to triumph is for good people to do\r\nnothing. Standing on the sidelines, or cowering before\r\nthe terrorist threat, in the naive hope that if we do not\r\noppose terrorism we will not draw its fire, cannot be an\r\noption. The people of the world look to their countries\r\nto prevail over terrorism. It cannot be appeased, and it\r\ncannot be assuaged. The only option is to defeat it.\r\nHaving said that, I would like to express my\r\ndeeply held conviction that the three great faiths —\r\nJudaism, Christianity and Islam — share the same\r\nvalues and obey the same fundamental commitments.\r\nThey have emerged from a common spirit that gave\r\nhumanity its ideals of justice, compassion, love and its\r\npromise of a future of goodness. Islam, Christianity\r\nand Judaism together constitute the bedrock of this\r\nhuman apogee. They epitomize the monotheistic creed\r\nthat should flourish alongside other ancient religions\r\nand beliefs within a true, comprehensive and inclusive\r\ninter-faith dialogue.\r\nToday, more than ever, our common spiritual\r\nheritage should inspire and nurture our acts for the\r\nbetterment of our common being and our common\r\ndestiny.\r\nMr. Leslie (Belize): The delegation of Belize\r\naligns itself with the statement to be presented by the\r\nrepresentative of Dominica on behalf of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) Group.\r\nWe are gathered in solidarity with the\r\ninternational community in an effort to formulate a\r\nunited response to terrorism. At the outset, allow me,\r\non behalf of Prime Minister Said Musa, the\r\nGovernment and people of Belize, to once more extend\r\nour deepest expressions of sympathy to the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States of America and, in\r\nparticular, to the families of those directly impacted by\r\nthe terrorist attacks we all witnessed on 11 September\r\nin our host city, New York, and in Washington, D.C.\r\nThe events of that terrible September morning\r\nserved to highlight the great risks that we face from\r\nterrorism. These attacks, while specifically targeted at\r\nthe citizens of the United States of America, were, in\r\nreality, attacks against all freedom-loving people.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nThose who engage in acts of terrorism seek to\r\njustify their criminal behaviour as championing the\r\nplight of the poor and oppressed of our world. We\r\ncategorically reject such claims and say that justice can\r\nnever be pursued through indiscriminate violence. It is\r\nthe position of the Government of Belize that any act\r\nof terrorism is an attack against our professed\r\ncommitment to democratic principles. Let no one claim\r\nto be acting on behalf of the marginalized of our\r\nsocieties through such unconscionable actions. As a\r\ndeveloping country whose population is working to\r\neradicate poverty and its attendant hardships, we\r\ncondemn any form of terrorism, for we strongly believe\r\nthat terrorism can serve no good purpose. Those who\r\nattack innocent civilians, who support, finance, engage\r\nin and encourage these criminal acts against humanity\r\nshould find no safe place in which to exist and operate.\r\nNot only are we steadfast in condemning\r\nterrorism, we are also committed to work to put an end\r\nto it by eliminating those forces that lie at its roots.\r\nBelize wants to be a partner in the global effort to\r\ncombat terrorism and remove it from our world, for it\r\nis in our interests to ensure that further acts of\r\nterrorism are not allowed to continue to take innocent\r\nlives. Attacks such as we have witnessed here in New\r\nYork, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania do not\r\nimpact only those at whom they are directly targeted,\r\nthey impact the entire world, compromising the very\r\nconfidence and security we work so hard to protect.\r\nThe Belize delegation welcomes Security Council\r\nresolutions 1373 (2001) and 1368 (2001), as well as\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1. We further\r\nundertake to use our best efforts to implement these\r\nresolutions and to participate in the development of\r\nholistic strategies at the multilateral, regional and\r\nnational levels to combat terrorism.\r\nBelize shares the grief caused by terrorism. We\r\ncondemn terrorist activities in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations and assure the international community\r\nthat we will do all we can to counter this scourge. We\r\nwill continue to advocate for the rights of all people,\r\nbut we will do so preserving the democratic principles\r\nand human rights we cherish.\r\nMr. Jalang’o (Kenya): Since I am taking the\r\nfloor for the first time, allow me to join other delegates\r\nwho have spoken before me in extending to the\r\nPresident our congratulations on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly. My delegation is\r\nconfident that his wise and able leadership will steer\r\nthe work of the fifty-sixth session towards its desired\r\ngoals.\r\nI wish also to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization\r\nand to congratulate him on his unanimous re-election\r\nto a second term in office. His re-election is an\r\nunequivocal manifestation of the confidence bestowed\r\nupon him, not only by the Member States of the United\r\nNations, but by the international community in its\r\nentirety.\r\nThe eleventh of September 2001 will remain a\r\nblack mark in the history of the world because it is the\r\nday the brutal hand of terrorism chose to strike the\r\nUnited States of America in the cities of New York and\r\nWashington, D.C. This dastardly attack, although\r\ncommitted in the territory of the United States, was an\r\nattack not just on America and its people, but on\r\nhumanity as a whole. It was, in fact, an attack on all the\r\npeace-loving people of the world, who were poised to\r\ncelebrate or were celebrating International Peace Day.\r\nAt the dawn of the events of 11 September, His\r\nExcellency President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi of\r\nKenya, on behalf of the people and the Government of\r\nKenya, sent a message to President George W. Bush,\r\nthe Government and the people of America, expressing\r\nour deepest sympathies and condemning in\r\nunequivocal terms these cowardly and despicable acts\r\nof terror.\r\nKenya once more condemns, in the strongest\r\npossible terms, these brutal acts of terrorism and all\r\nforms and manifestations of international terrorism,\r\nwhatever its motivation. As stated by my Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation this\r\nweek on 2 October 2001, in a ministerial statement to\r\nKenya’s Parliament:\r\n“It is our profound belief that terrorism can never\r\nform the basis for the resolution of conflicts and\r\ncannot be justified under any circumstances. We\r\ntherefore call upon the international community\r\nto redouble its efforts in the fight against\r\nterrorism.”\r\nTerrorism poses a serious threat to international\r\npeace and security and is fundamentally in\r\ncontradiction to the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nthe established principles of international relations. It\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\ntherefore behoves every nation that believes in these\r\nprinciples to abhor and condemn terrorism and to take\r\nevery step within its power to fight this heinous\r\nscourge.\r\nAll nations, irrespective of their size, might or\r\ninfluence, and all people, irrespective of their colour,\r\nsex, race or religion, are directly or indirectly affected\r\nby terrorism. In 1998 my country had a first-hand\r\nexperience with the grim face of terrorism, when the\r\nhand of terror struck the American Embassy in Nairobi,\r\nkilling not only Americans, but over 200 Kenyans, who\r\nwere innocently going about their daily business and\r\nleaving thousands severely injured and/or impaired for\r\nlife. The 1998 attack was targeted at three American\r\nEmbassies in East Africa. The Embassy in Dar-es-\r\nSalaam was bombed simultaneously with the Embassy\r\nin Nairobi, whereas the attempt on the American\r\nEmbassy in Kampala was thwarted. As a result of these\r\nattacks, the East African community established a joint\r\ncommittee to coordinate our actions against terrorism.\r\nFor its part, immediately after the 1998 bombing,\r\nKenya put in place various measures as safeguards\r\nagainst any terrorist attacks in the future. These\r\nincluded the tracking down and arrest of any suspected\r\naccomplices to terrorist groups, more vigorous vetting\r\nof foreigners and the tightening of security at our\r\nairports and other entry points. These measures have\r\nbeen further strengthened after the 11 September attack\r\non United States territory.\r\nWe call for a unified, global and unrelenting\r\napproach in fighting this scourge, under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations. In this regard, my delegation\r\nwishes to echo the words of the Secretary-General in\r\ncalling for a united front, a global coalition under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, in fighting terrorism;\r\nfor terrorism is now a worldwide problem. My\r\ndelegation shares the concerns of the international\r\ncommunity about the alarming increase in acts of\r\nterrorism and fully supports measures at the\r\ninternational level to combat terrorism.\r\nKenya has signed and ratified or acceded to a\r\nnumber of international conventions on combating\r\nterrorism. The International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings has been signed and\r\ninternal procedures are under way for its ratification.\r\nWe also support measures taken by the United Nations\r\ntowards the suppression of international financing of\r\nterrorism and, in this regard, will sign the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism in the near future.\r\nKenya commends the Security Council for its\r\nadoption of resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001).\r\nThose resolutions are comprehensive and add impetus\r\nto the global fight against terrorism. We support the\r\nmeasures outlined in the resolutions and call for\r\ninternational cooperation in their implementation. We\r\nalso call for the strengthening of international\r\ncooperation and for the speedy conclusion of the work\r\nof the United Nations to establish an effective\r\ninternational legal regime to fight this evil and its\r\nperpetrators.\r\nHowever, many small countries have neither the\r\nmeans nor the ability to respond effectively to this\r\nthreat. My delegation therefore calls upon the United\r\nNations to explore and coordinate the possibilities\r\nexisting within its system to assist States in building\r\ncapacity to combat the menace. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly put it,\r\n“The United Nations is uniquely positioned to\r\nadvance this effort. It provides the forum\r\nnecessary for building a universal coalition and\r\ncan ensure global legitimacy for the long-term\r\nresponse to terrorism.” (The New York Times, 21\r\nSeptember 2001)\r\nThe time is now ripe for the holding of the\r\nproposed high-level conference to formulate a joint and\r\norganized international response to terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my\r\nGovernment’s full cooperation and support in the\r\nglobal war against terrorism. It is incumbent upon us to\r\nwork together to eliminate the threats to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nMr. Ishmael (Guyana): The Guyana delegation\r\nassociates itself with the statement that will be made by\r\nthe representative of the Commonwealth of Dominica\r\non behalf of the Caribbean Community.\r\nGuyana vehemently deplores the criminal and\r\nmonstrously destructive terrorist acts of 11 September,\r\nwhich have had the effect of converting a part of our\r\nhost city into a veritable war zone with enormous loss\r\nof life, a state of affairs replicated to a degree in\r\nWashington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania. The loss of life\r\nreverberates throughout the community and the world,\r\nthe victims and their loved ones coming from a\r\nmultitude of nationalities and ethnicities, many of my\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nown countrymen and countrywomen perishing with the\r\nrest. The loss of life and property has also been\r\ninjurious to economies everywhere in this age of\r\nglobalization.\r\nGuyana extends its deepest sympathy to the\r\npeople and the Government of the United States upon\r\ntheir suffering and loss. We wish the United States\r\nGovernment every success in its efforts to marshal the\r\nforces of humanity in a coalition to conquer\r\ninternational terrorism, which affects us all and which\r\nviolates the ideals that we both profess and support. If\r\nit were to go unchallenged, it would have the effect of\r\nnegating all that we have worked and struggled for in\r\nthis Organization since its founding in 1945.\r\nGuyana’s opposition to terrorism is complete and\r\nabsolute. In a message delivered on the occasion of an\r\ninter-faith service of remembrance held in New York\r\non 30 September 2001 for 24 Guyanese nationals who\r\nlost their lives in this disaster, Guyana’s President, His\r\nExcellency Bharrat Jagdeo, declared that\r\n“Death is always a painful thing. When it\r\ncomes to people in their youth or in the prime of\r\ntheir lives, and when it comes so tragically and in\r\nsuch an unexpected fashion, as it did to our\r\nGuyanese brothers and sisters on 11 September in\r\nthat disaster of such mind-boggling dimensions,\r\nthe wrenching pain is unbearable and the grief\r\nunsupportable. Guyana supports the efforts to rein\r\nin terror and we pledge our full cooperation to\r\nroot out terrorism”.\r\nGuyana, as a country with a substantial Muslim\r\npopulation and as a member of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, is anxious for our efforts to\r\neradicate terrorism to succeed. However, it is\r\nimperative that we guard against the bigotry that has\r\ndriven some to blame Muslims and Arabs for the\r\nevents of 11 September. It has been well and succinctly\r\nstated at this podium earlier in the debate, that\r\nterrorism has no religion, no nationality and no\r\nethnicity. No religion authorizes or legitimizes\r\nterrorism, and any protestations or claims to the\r\ncontrary are no more than a vain political excuse to\r\njustify that which can never be vindicated.\r\nGuyana supports the multifaceted efforts of our\r\nOrganization to deal with terrorism. An abundance of\r\nanti-terrorist conventions is today on offer, and one\r\nmore is still in negotiation. We currently subscribe to\r\nthe Organization of American States Declaration of\r\nLima to Prevent, Combat and Eliminate Terrorism with\r\nits Plan of Action on Hemispheric Cooperation,\r\napproved on 26 April 1996. We also support the\r\nresolution adopted by the Organization of American\r\nStates on 21 September 2001 at the Meeting of\r\nConsultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of States\r\nparties, invoking the Inter-American Treaty of\r\nReciprocal Assistance, the Rio Treaty. That resolution\r\nestablished a programme of solidarity and mutual\r\nassistance in the American hemisphere to deal with the\r\nscourge of terrorism.\r\nThese efforts require for their success that we pay\r\nheed to the instances of injustice that abound in the\r\ncontemporary world. Where injustice is manifest, it can\r\nbecome a politically destabilizing force and breed\r\nhatred — conditions that might be exploited by the\r\nunscrupulous for the furtherance of their own evil ends.\r\nThe current revolution in communications has now\r\nrendered it impossible to conceal injustice from the\r\neyes of its victims.\r\nIt was the decolonization process that gave rise to\r\nthe greatest increase in the membership of our\r\nOrganization. We must ensure that the freedoms which\r\nwe sought for ourselves are enjoyed by everyone else\r\n— that there is everywhere respect for human rights,\r\nfor our common humanity; for our right as human\r\nbeings to pursue our legitimate destiny, whether\r\nindividually or as a collective, embodied in a state\r\nwithout arbitrary interference or denial; that the\r\nautonomy of the human spirit is maximized and its\r\ncreativity thereby nurtured.\r\nGuyana welcomes Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), which, in our view, represents a\r\nsignificant advance in the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to eradicate terrorism, while\r\nsimultaneously constituting an innovative\r\ninterpretation of the Charter of the United Nations. The\r\nmeaning of the Charter in 2001 is significantly at\r\nvariance with its meaning in 1945, and this reality is\r\nreflective of the changes in the world that have\r\noccurred in the intervening period. We are concerned\r\nhere with the fashioning of a legal structure that will\r\nfacilitate the attainment of a purpose we all endorse.\r\nThe validity of all law — and international law is no\r\nexception — has a temporal dimension, and change\r\nbeing inherent in all forms of human social\r\norganization, it follows inevitably and inexorably that\r\nlaw must be adapted to the exigencies of that change if\r\nit is to preserve its relevance and effectiveness.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nIn a dissent from an advisory opinion given by\r\nthe International Court of Justice and requested by our\r\nAssembly concerning the “Competence of the General\r\nAssembly for the Admission of a State to the United\r\nNations,” the distinguished Chilean Judge Alejandro\r\nAlvarez stated that\r\n“it is necessary, when interpreting treaties — in\r\nparticular, the Charter of the United Nations — to\r\nlook ahead, that is, to have regard to the new\r\nconditions, and not to look back. A treaty or a\r\ntext that has once been established acquires a life\r\nof its own. Consequently, in interpreting it we\r\nmust have regard to the exigencies of\r\ncontemporary life.”\r\nThe period in which we live is different from\r\n1945, and the framers of the Charter contemplated\r\nthreats to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity that are often radically at variance with the\r\nkinds of threats with which we are confronted today.\r\nInternational terrorism, in all its ramifications, does\r\nconstitute a threat to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. It is therefore appropriate that the\r\ndecision-making machinery that is vested in Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter is enlisted with a view to eradicating\r\nthis malady. Guyana will fulfil the obligations that\r\nhave been laid upon us all by Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001).\r\nAs I close, I reiterate Guyana’s unswerving\r\nsupport for all the efforts we have crafted for the\r\npurpose of defeating terrorism. These efforts are\r\nhugely multilateral and derive an enhanced legitimacy\r\nfrom that sobering reality. We shall prevail. Our\r\nsurvival, with the full complement of rights to which\r\nwe all aspire, requires that we do.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova): The\r\nterrorist acts perpetrated in New York, Washington,\r\nD.C., and Pennsylvania on 11 September are an assault\r\nnot only on the United States but also on all of\r\nhumankind.\r\nMy delegation strongly condemns these criminal\r\nacts, which brought terror and resulted in the deaths of\r\nthousands of innocent people from the United States\r\nand from many other nations. As the President of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova stated immediately after those\r\ntragic events,\r\n“We oppose and condemn terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations. We are fully committed\r\nto international efforts to ensure that those\r\nresponsible for these inhumane acts, whoever\r\nthey might be, are brought to justice and\r\npunished.”\r\nThe immediate response by the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council on 12 September,\r\nas well as the unanimous adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), illustrates the increased\r\nimportance of the United Nations in the fight against\r\nterrorism. The establishment of a committee to monitor\r\nthe implementation of this resolution should\r\nsignificantly enhance its practical impact on the way in\r\nwhich States coordinate their efforts to combat\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova fully associates itself\r\nwith all aspects of Security Council resolutions 1368\r\n(2001) and 1373 (2001), which reaffirm the\r\ndetermination of the international community to\r\ncombat by all means threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity caused by terrorist acts.\r\nMoldova actively supported the adoption of the\r\n1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate\r\nInternational Terrorism, which underscores that\r\nterrorist acts are\r\n“in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the\r\nconsiderations of a political, philosophical,\r\nideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other\r\nnature that may be invoked to justify them”.\r\n(A/49/60, annex, part I, para. 3).\r\nIn this spirit, we support the multilateral efforts\r\naimed at strengthening the United Nations anti-terrorist\r\nlegal framework, including the early conclusion of a\r\nconvention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism as well as a comprehensive international\r\nconvention on international terrorism. In particular, we\r\nbelieve that with the adoption of the comprehensive\r\nconvention, some sensitive and complex issues will be\r\nresolved and, consequently, the existing gaps in the\r\nlegal regime of anti-terrorist cooperation will be filled.\r\nIt is only through developing and implementing a\r\nnetwork of anti-terrorist instruments that the\r\ninternational community can effectively ensure that\r\nterrorists find no safe haven from which they can\r\ncontinue their criminal activities.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova is a State party to six of\r\nthe 12 terrorism-related United Nations treaties and\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.19\r\nprotocols. Measures are under way to enable our\r\ncountry to accede to other remaining conventions,\r\nincluding the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism. My Government is seriously\r\nconsidering signing those two conventions by the end\r\nof this year. Early this week, our Parliament adopted,\r\non the first reading, a bill on terrorism, which is a\r\nfurther indication of our ongoing commitment to\r\nimplementing the United Nations conventions on\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova will also actively\r\ncooperate in combating any terrorist activities through\r\nconcerted efforts with other countries in the framework\r\nof various regional organizations, including the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nthe Council of Europe and the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States.\r\nThe events of 11 September have shown that the\r\ninternational community must seek with renewed\r\ndetermination to resolve the long-standing international\r\nproblems on which terrorism feeds. From this\r\nperspective, we must urgently address many conflicts\r\naround the world, their roots and, implicitly, all those\r\nfactors which could nurture the development of\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Security Council emphasizes, in paragraph 4\r\nof resolution 1373 (2001), the connection between\r\ninternational terrorism and transnational organized\r\ncrime, illicit drugs and other illegal activities. In this\r\ncontext, I feel obliged to add my voice to that of those\r\nwho see the phenomenon of separatism also as a root\r\ncause of conflict, as well as a threat to international\r\npeace and security. Besides being anachronistic in a\r\nglobalized and interdependent world, separatism affects\r\nthe very basis of multicultural and multi-ethnic\r\nsocieties and poses a grave danger to the sovereignty\r\nand integrity of many States. As a country affected by\r\nseparatism, we are alarmed at the persistence of this\r\nscourge and the connections it may sometimes have\r\nwith other serious criminal activities. That is why, in\r\nour opinion, this issue, among others, must be taken\r\ninto account by the United Nations Member States in\r\ntheir efforts to elaborate and implement a\r\ncomprehensive and efficient anti-terrorist strategy.\r\nI should like to conclude by reasserting our\r\nunreserved condemnation of all forms of terrorism and\r\nour firm commitment to standing with the international\r\ncommunity in this struggle at every step of this long\r\nway.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
