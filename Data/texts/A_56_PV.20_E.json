(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 166 (continued)\r\nMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/160 and\r\nCorr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): I should like to thank you\r\nvery much, Mr. President, for organizing this timely\r\ndebate on measures to eliminate international\r\nterrorism, on the heels of the gravest terrorist attack in\r\nhuman history. I take this opportunity to express our\r\ndeep sympathy and condolences to the Government and\r\npeople of the United States, as well as to the bereaved\r\nfamilies, for the tragedy that befell them on 11\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\nThe terrorists aimed at America, but they\r\nassaulted our common humanity and challenged the\r\nvery values and principles the United Nations and its\r\nMember States stand to defend. Nearly 6,000 people —\r\nchildren, young and old, men and women — from\r\nAmerica and some 80 other countries died or are\r\nmissing under the rubble. Furthermore, 40,000 children\r\nwill die before the age of five as an economic\r\ndownturn hits the developing world as a result of the\r\nstrike.\r\nThe economic cost of the horror is equally\r\nstupendous and widespread. While the already\r\nweakening United States economy sustained a\r\nstaggering $40 billion loss, thousands of people\r\nwitnessed their investments, employment and dreams\r\ngo up in smoke. And the tidal wave of the destruction\r\nis likely to condemn 10 million people to poverty in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe all know that terrorism destabilizes our\r\nStates, destroys our economies and causes our societies\r\nto decay. Before that fateful day of 11 September,\r\nhowever, we could not imagine the extent to which the\r\nextremists were likely to go in their evil acts. Next time\r\nit could be worse, with the use of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction — biological, chemical or even nuclear.\r\nRather than intimidating the civilized world with\r\ntheir fanaticism, the terrorists have strengthened our\r\nresolve to defend our values and way of life. They have\r\nbrought countries and peoples together in a broad\r\ncoalition, united across race, region and religion.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1 and Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001)\r\nembody our resolve. We now must act on them.\r\nNepal has firsthand experience of violence — that\r\nunleashed by the so-called Maoist insurgency, which\r\nseeks to destroy democracy and freedom and to\r\nestablish a totalitarian republic. The six-year violence\r\nhas claimed more than 1,800 lives, disrupted our\r\ndevelopment process and destabilized our society.\r\nNepal strongly condemns terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations, and is committed to acting against it.\r\nWe believe that each State has the right to defend itself\r\nagainst terrorist threats and to bring the perpetrators to\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\njustice. Nepal pledges its full cooperation to the United\r\nStates Government in its campaign against terrorism.\r\nA war against terror must be wider, deeper and\r\nstronger. It will not be easy or short. We will have to\r\nwage it on diplomatic, economic, political and military\r\nfronts to isolate terrorists, thwart their plots and\r\neliminate their threats. We must starve them of their\r\nfunds and track their communication links; we should\r\nfrustrate cooperation among various terrorist groups,\r\ndrug traffickers and other organized criminals —\r\ncooperation which the terrorists use to raise finances,\r\ngain information, acquire weapons and execute their\r\ndeadly designs. We should deny them shelter and\r\nsanctuary, deprive them of rest and refuge and ostracize\r\ntheir sponsors. We must take decisive action in the\r\nshort run and be prepared for a long haul.\r\nIt would be folly to be captive to the impulse for\r\nrevenge and retreat. Unless we fight to the finish, more\r\nvirulent seeds of extremism will be sown in days\r\nahead.\r\nThe method and manner in which States are\r\npursuing cooperation to build a broad alliance, to\r\ninvestigate the suspected terrorist network for evidence\r\nand to cut their financial umbilical cord has encouraged\r\nNepal. We hope that the cardinal principles of justice\r\nand fairness, the values that terrorists despise and\r\ncivilized societies cherish, will be observed when\r\naction is taken, since these values set democratic\r\nsocieties apart from clandestine criminal networks.\r\nThe crime of a handful of culprits does not\r\nconstitute the culpability of an entire community or\r\nculture. As casualties among innocent people are likely\r\nto tear down the coalition and generate a disastrous\r\nbacklash, military targets should be selected carefully,\r\nand action should be surgical and precise. We need to\r\ndebunk the terrorists’ mystique and unmask their\r\noutrageous propaganda in order to expose their\r\npreposterous claims of crusade or cause.\r\nThe war on terror will have to be waged with\r\nequal vigour on the development and peace fronts as\r\nwell. It will not be won until we remove dehumanizing\r\npoverty, ignorance and exclusion, and resolve conflicts\r\nthat leave youth in despair and offer terrorists a pool of\r\nwilling young recruits and supporters. We will have to\r\ncreate stakes for everyone in the existing global order\r\nand within its rules.\r\nVictory will be impossible without committed and\r\nwilling international cooperation. Countries that have\r\nthe will but not the wealth to carry out the fight against\r\nthis menace should receive cooperation and support\r\nfrom those who can afford it. And the United Nations\r\ncan and should be pivotal in gathering and galvanizing\r\nglobal cooperation against terrorism.\r\nIn fact, the world body already has a dozen\r\ninstruments to fight international terrorism. In addition,\r\nthere are seven regional conventions, including one in\r\nSouth Asia. We must invoke and implement them,\r\naccede to them if we have not done so and strengthen\r\nthem if necessary. And we must conclude a\r\ncomprehensive and cogent convention against\r\nterrorism. When we agree on a broad picture, details\r\nshould not prevent progress.\r\nThe slaughter of 11 September made an\r\nunequivocal statement: no one is immune from terrorist\r\nthreats, and they can be horrendous beyond\r\nimagination. It has also reinforced the notion of the\r\nworld’s being a global village, where the fire of\r\ndiscontent in one corner can spread through the entire\r\nvillage. We must therefore work in partnership both to\r\ndefeat terrorism and to prevent it from ever again\r\nraising its ugly head, by removing deprivation,\r\ndiscrimination and deadly disputes where terrorism\r\nthrives.\r\nThis is a challenge that will put to the test our\r\nwill to act together out of enlightened self-interest, our\r\nwillingness to reorder our priorities and our\r\ncommitment to unity. It is a daunting task, but it will be\r\nequally rewarding for all of us.\r\nMr. Orellana (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nHonduras is proud to be the coordinator of the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System (SICA), and it is in this\r\ncapacity that I appear before the Assembly.\r\nAllow me, Mr. President, to congratulate you on\r\nyour assumption of the presidency of this fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly and to offer you the\r\nsupport of my Mission in your delicate task.\r\nThe world witnessed with horror the terrorist\r\nattack of 11 September, and now no one doubts that\r\neveryone is within the reach of such a criminal action.\r\nIn the list of victims we find, along with United States\r\ncitizens, a great many people from Central America, as\r\nwell as nationals of other countries — people whose\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nfervent dream it was to be part of the American dream,\r\nwho were generously welcomed by this great nation.\r\nTo the families of those who perished in this\r\ninhuman attack, our condolences and sympathy. To the\r\nGovernment of the United States, to the authorities of\r\nthe city and State of New York, and to the people of\r\nNew York, we extend our brotherly and sincere support\r\nat this difficult time and our recognition of their\r\nextraordinary crisis management organization.\r\nBut the attack is also aimed at our most cherished\r\nvalues, those that sustain the system of life in modern\r\nsociety. That is why this has a worldwide dimension.\r\nBut our common enemy is terrorism. Therefore, the\r\ndecisions to be adopted must be precise and\r\ncongruent — that is, they must be specifically targeted\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nThe Central American countries, aware of the\r\nmagnitude of these inhuman actions, acted immediately\r\nin response to the tragedy. The President pro tempore\r\nof SICA, President Carlos Roberto Flores of the\r\nRepublic of Honduras, invited the Presidents of the\r\nother Central American republics to a summit meeting\r\nin El Zamorano, Honduras, where the Declaration\r\nentitled “Central America united against terrorism”\r\nwas adopted. This document was presented as a letter\r\nto the Secretary-General on 20 September and\r\npublished under the symbol A/56/392. Certainly, by\r\nnow it has been circulated to the Assembly. The\r\ndocument firmly condemns acts of terrorism, no matter\r\nwhat their form, and considers them crimes against\r\nhumanity and a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. That is why the Declaration states that Central\r\nAmerica endorses the Security Council resolution\r\nadopted on 12 September.\r\nAmong other measures, the Presidents of the\r\ncountries of Central America decided the following:\r\nfirst, to improve and streamline the mechanisms for\r\nexchange of information concerning possible terrorist\r\nactions, among themselves and with the United States\r\nand other regional and multilateral bodies. Secondly,\r\nthey decided to reinforce security along the borders and\r\nat the ports and airports of the region, as well as to step\r\nup control of migratory movements to prevent any\r\nmovement of persons linked to terrorism. Thirdly, they\r\ndecided to coordinate actions so that Central American\r\nterritory will not be used by terrorist groups of any\r\norigin or ideology. Fourthly, they decided to promote\r\nthe implementation of the necessary standards so that\r\nthese crimes against humanity will be judged and\r\npunished as such by establishing adequate mechanisms\r\nto expedite extradition and to deliver these criminals to\r\nthe States that so request; and fifthly, they decided to\r\nensure the full entry into force of the relevant regional\r\nand international instruments.\r\nIn addition, sectoral meetings have already been\r\nheld to coordinate follow-up to this political\r\ndeclaration, such as the recently held meeting of the\r\nCentral American Security Commission.\r\nCentral America’s response has been quick and\r\nforceful. We will spare no effort to join in solidarity\r\nwith the decisions adopted by this world forum and to\r\nparticipate in the actions to be undertaken, because\r\nsupport for the international community in its fight\r\nagainst terrorism must be unanimous and unlimited.\r\nMr. Nteturuye (Burundi) (spoke in French): The\r\npictures of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on\r\nthe fateful morning of 11 September 2001 shocked the\r\nentire human community. Barbarism and infamy found\r\ntheir best expression in the terrorist attacks of that day,\r\nto such an extent that television viewers around the\r\nworld asked themselves if what they were watching on\r\nthe screen was reality or fiction. The diabolical forces\r\nhad indeed just hit New York, a world capital, a capital\r\nof all civilization, our beloved city.\r\nThe General Assembly debate on international\r\nterrorism gives me the opportunity to join my own\r\nvoice to that of the President of Burundi, speaking on\r\nbehalf of the Government and the people of Burundi,\r\nand to the voices of the Mayor of the city of\r\nBujumbura, of Rudolph Giuliani and of the Mayor of\r\nthe city of Washington, D.C., to offer my sincere\r\ncondolences to the American people and to the families\r\nof the victims of the tragedy of 11 September 2001. All\r\nthe Burundi people join the American people and all\r\nthe peoples of the world in mourning the victims of the\r\ntragedy and in attempting to understand the reason for\r\nsuch human madness.\r\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September act against\r\npeace and international security. The Mayor of the city\r\nof New York emphasized that; the Secretary-General\r\ndid also.\r\nHence the relevance of this joint reflection within\r\nour world Organization, whose primary mission is,\r\naccording to the Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter,\r\nto “save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nwar” and to “maintain international peace and security”\r\nby taking “effective collective measures for the\r\nprevention and removal of threats to peace, and for the\r\nsuppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of\r\npeace”.\r\nPrevent and suppress: this is what the\r\ninternational community must do, not only rhetorically\r\nor abstractly, but also concretely, daily, without evasion\r\nor ambiguity. The United Nations provides a privileged\r\nforum for action and coordination.\r\nThe world must be convinced that it is one, that\r\nthe people who compose it are linked by a common\r\ndestiny, share the same aspirations and must be\r\ncomforted by the same hopes. That is why Burundi\r\nwelcomes the speed and the enthusiasm with which the\r\ncountries of the world have formed a united front\r\nagainst terrorism, a new scourge that has joined the\r\nscourges of poverty and disease.\r\nThe authors of the actions of 11 September must\r\nanswer for their acts before justice, and their networks\r\nmust be dismantled. The American Government has the\r\nright to punish the guilty, and it has Burundi’s support,\r\nprovided that the enemy is well targeted and the\r\noperation does not cause the death of innocent\r\ncivilians.\r\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly\r\ncondemned the terrorist attack that very day. Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) is a real blueprint for\r\nthe immediate combat of terrorism. International\r\ncooperation is called upon to function fully and\r\nimmediately.\r\nBut that will not be sufficient if all countries do\r\nnot understand terrorism in the same way and if deep\r\nreflection is not initiated to try to crack the shell of this\r\nnew evil of modern times, in order to better eradicate\r\nit.\r\nVarious delegations have expressed the wish that\r\nthis debate would not dwell indefinitely on the\r\ndefinition of terrorism and that this task would be left\r\nto experts in international humanitarian law. While we\r\nunderstand this stance in view of the urgency of the\r\nsituation and the criminal shock of 11 September, my\r\ndelegation believes that the world coalition against\r\nterrorism will not be truly effective unless all the actors\r\nidentify the cause of evil and attack its roots, instead of\r\nbeginning by treating the symptoms.\r\nIndeed, terrorism was not born on 11 September.\r\nIt has existed for a long time, and it kills thousands of\r\ninnocent people throughout the world every day. It\r\noften seems that what is considered a terrorist act by\r\nsome is tolerated or is even seen by others as\r\n“liberating violence”. This situation is very dangerous\r\nfor the struggle that we must carry out together.\r\nIn its paragraph 2, resolution 55/158, adopted by\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly on 30\r\nJanuary 2001\r\n“Reiterates that criminal acts intended or\r\ncalculated to provoke a state of terror in the\r\ngeneral public, a group of persons or particular\r\npersons for political purposes are in any\r\ncircumstances unjustifiable, whatever the\r\nconsiderations of a political, philosophical,\r\nideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other\r\nnature that may be invoked to justify them.”\r\nThe Organization of African Unity Convention on\r\nthe Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, adopted in\r\nAlgeria on 14 July 1999, defines in its first article a\r\nterrorist act as any act or threat of act that can endanger\r\nlife, physical integrity, the freedom of a person or of a\r\ngroup of persons, and is committed with the intention\r\nof intimidating, provoking a situation of terror; forcing,\r\npressuring or leading Governments, agencies,\r\ninstitutions, populations or groups of populations to\r\nundertake any initiative, or to abstain from adopting or\r\ngiving up a given policy, or to adopt or renounce any\r\nparticular position, or to follow certain principles; or is\r\nintended to disturb the normal functioning of public\r\nservices, the provision of essential services to\r\npopulations and to create a crisis situation among\r\npopulations; or is intended to create a general\r\ninsurrection within a given State party.\r\nIn its third article, the same Convention specifies\r\nthat struggles waged by peoples in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of international law for liberation or self-\r\ndetermination, including armed struggle against\r\ncolonialism, occupation, aggression and domination by\r\nforeign forces, are not considered terrorist acts.\r\nThis approach is shared by the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee established by resolution 51/210 and the\r\nWorking Group of the Sixth Committee, as a careful\r\nreading of the report (A/56/37) of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee shows.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nIn his introductory statement to our debate, the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, underscored that\r\nwe need not only legal precision in the definition of\r\nterrorism, but also moral clarity. He said:\r\n“There can be no acceptance of those who would\r\nseek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent\r\ncivilian life, regardless of cause or grievance. …\r\n“Even in situations of armed conflict, the\r\ntargeting of innocent civilians is illegal, as well as\r\nmorally unacceptable.” (A/56/PV.12)\r\nIn other words, even war has rules that must be\r\nfollowed. That is why the hateful attacks against the\r\ninnocent populations of New York, Washington and\r\nPennsylvania are acts of terrorism that must be\r\nunreservedly condemned by the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe people of Burundi feel all the more solidarity\r\nwith the people of the United States in their pain,\r\nbecause for eight years it, too, has been victim to\r\nterrorism and acts of genocide committed by armed\r\ngroups supported from abroad. The mobilization and\r\nenthusiasm following the attack of 11 September lead\r\nthe people of Burundi to hope that the international\r\ncommunity will finally understand that blind violence\r\ncaused by armed groups for so-called political ends\r\nmust be considered as terrorism and fought against as\r\nsuch within the framework of this world coalition.\r\nFor how can one justify a deadly attack against\r\nstudents in their dormitories by assailants that say they\r\nare defending democracy? How are we to describe the\r\ngradual decimation by disease, hunger and\r\nhopelessness of hundreds of unfortunate, rejected\r\nwomen, children and old people, survivors of the\r\ntragedy of 1993, who are confined in camps for\r\ndisplaced persons? How are we to describe fanatics\r\nwho dismember babies and tear open pregnant women\r\nwhile singing “Alleluia” and reciting verses from the\r\nBible? How can we tolerate irrational fatal attacks\r\nagainst buses full of passengers — nationals as well as\r\nforeigners? What are we to say about attacks against\r\ninternational airlines that serve our national capital?\r\nWhy is the international community procrastinating\r\nwhen thousands of assailants, in coalition with\r\ngenocidal Rwandan fighters, as the report annexed to\r\ndocument S/1998/777 attests, infiltrate into Burundi\r\nand commit their criminal, genocidal acts, gladly\r\nboasting of them in the media of countries that have\r\nseen the birth of modern civilization and where the\r\ncriminals have received asylum?\r\nLet us not delude ourselves. War and violence,\r\nunfortunately, will not soon cease in our world, despite\r\nthe collective realization of the danger of terrorism.\r\nOne of the weaknesses of international action is\r\nhypocrisy, double standards dictated by contradictory\r\ninterests.\r\nIn Burundi, all the violence which I have just\r\ndescribed has not kept the Burundi people from sitting\r\ndown at the negotiating table to attempt to define the\r\nevils that corrode their society and agree measures to\r\nward them off. A well known sociological precept\r\nteaches us that man is born good, but society makes\r\nhim bad. The dialogue continues, therefore, despite the\r\nopposition of those who believe that the authors of the\r\ndaily crimes have since October 1993 committed\r\ngenocide in Burundi.\r\nThe political accord that negotiators signed a year\r\nago concluded that the conflict in Burundi is\r\nessentially political, with a very strong tribal overtone.\r\nThere must, then, be a political solution, but at the\r\nsame time, there must be a defence against the\r\ncriminals who attack innocent civilian populations and\r\nhave refused to join the camp of those that want peace,\r\nthereby showing their true face.\r\nAfter all, the people of Burundi lived together in\r\ncomplete harmony before the inoculation of the\r\ndivisive germ of colonialism, which developed into a\r\ngenocidal ideology responsible for the holocaust in\r\nBurundi and Rwanda. Peaceful coexistence is still\r\npossible. The threat to universal values in this region of\r\nAfrica is also a threat to peace and international\r\nsecurity. That is why it is a universal duty to fight\r\nmercilessly against genocidal assailants and terrorists,\r\nwherever they may be from.\r\nEverything must be clear for the world coalition,\r\nat the level of legal instruments for the struggle against\r\nterrorism and international crime and at the level of\r\ndrug trafficking and the illegal arms trade. There must\r\nbe the same firm commitment to fight poverty, misery,\r\ndisease, ignorance and the other scourges that can\r\nexplain fanaticism and hopelessness, especially among\r\nyoung people, without, however, justifying the\r\nresulting irrational violence.\r\nBurundi is committed to signing, ratifying or\r\nadhering to all international conventions in the struggle\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nagainst terrorism as soon as possible, and supports the\r\nconvening of a high-level conference to define a joint\r\nresponse to terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. Burundi will also implement the\r\nrelevant provisions of the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, as well as the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Convention on\r\nthe Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, to which it\r\nis already a party. Finally, Burundi will soon adapt its\r\nnational laws to international conventions concerning\r\nthe struggle against terrorism, being convinced that the\r\ntime has come for the world to adopt precise measures\r\nagainst this danger for present and future generations.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the work under way to\r\narrive at a comprehensive convention against terrorism\r\nwill be quickly concluded in order to complement the\r\nlegal arsenal now available. The world must be firm\r\nand organized, with countries standing together, to\r\ncarry out an effective struggle against international\r\nterrorism, the common enemy of us all.\r\nMr. Beyendeza (Uganda): I congratulate you, Sir,\r\nand your country on assuming the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I also salute\r\nyour initiative, supported by the General Assembly, to\r\ngive priority to the consideration of measures to\r\neliminate international terrorism.\r\nMy delegation fully aligns itself with the remarks\r\nmade earlier by the Permanent Representatives of\r\nTanzania and Kenya on joint regional efforts being\r\nmade by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to deal with the\r\nproblem of terrorism.\r\nOn Tuesday, 11 September 2001, the United\r\nStates of America suffered the worst terrorist attack in\r\nhistory, as the terrorists struck targets in Washington,\r\nD.C., and New York, causing the tragic loss of\r\nthousands of innocent victims from the United States\r\nand over 80 other nations around the globe.\r\nThe President of Uganda, Mr. Yoweri Kaguta\r\nMuseveni, the Government and the people of Uganda\r\nhave already sent their heartfelt condolences and\r\nsympathy to President George Bush, the Government\r\nand the people of the United States of America. The\r\nbarbaric action against innocent victims fills the people\r\nof Uganda with revulsion and indignation, and must\r\nnot go unpunished. At this time of grief, our thoughts\r\nand prayers go to the victims, their relatives, friends\r\nand all those others who have been touched in one way\r\nor another by these tragic events.\r\nNo political, economic or religious reasons can\r\njustify the terrorists’ use of indiscriminate violence\r\nagainst innocent people. Terrorism as a strategy is\r\nunacceptable, erroneous and ethically indefensible as a\r\nmeans of fighting even for a just cause. It is erroneous\r\nand indefensible because it targets people who may not\r\nbe enemies. Indeed, many victims of the terrorist\r\nattacks in the United States on 11 September may have\r\nbeen sympathetic, neutral or simply indifferent to the\r\nvery causes to which the terrorists wished to lay claim.\r\nIt is unacceptable because such acts create terror in\r\nevery society, endanger lives and undermine the well-\r\nbeing of individuals and families by disrupting\r\neconomies, and pose a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Uganda therefore unequivocally condemns as\r\ncriminal and unjustifiable all acts, methods and\r\npractices of terrorism, regardless of where they are\r\ncommitted or by whom.\r\nFor the last 15 years the people of Uganda have\r\nbeen facing terrorism carried out by the fundamentalist\r\nLord’s Resistance Army, in the northern parts of\r\nUganda, and by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF),\r\nin the southern parts of Uganda. Both the Lord’s\r\nResistance Army and the Allied Democratic Forces are\r\ngroups that have hitherto been supported by the Sudan.\r\nThe method of terror employed by the Lord’s\r\nResistance Army is to maim innocent children and\r\nwomen, cutting off body parts, and to kidnap survivors,\r\ntaking them to their bases outside Uganda. The ADF’s\r\nmethod has been characterised by the use of terrorist\r\nbombs placed in buses, taxis and busy shopping areas\r\nin Kampala and other towns in Uganda.\r\nHowever, Uganda is particularly encouraged by\r\nthe statement by the representative of the Sudan to the\r\nAssembly on 2 October that the Sudan will no longer\r\nallow its territory to be a haven for any terrorist groups\r\nor individuals, and that it is now ready to match words\r\nwith deeds. We therefore expect that commitment to be\r\nfollowed by concrete steps to stop the Lord’s\r\nResistance Army and ADF terrorist attacks on Uganda.\r\nThose terrorist attacks have had a very negative\r\neffect on our country and our economy. It is estimated,\r\nfor example, that the Ugandan economy would have by\r\nfar surpassed the current average gross domestic\r\nproduct (GDP) growth of 6.5 per cent had it not been\r\nfor the sustained campaign of terrorism inflicted on the\r\nUgandan people for one and a half decades.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nMr Balzan (Malta), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nIn his address to Parliament in Kampala two days\r\nafter the incident in New York, our Minister of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs outlined Uganda’s three-tier\r\ncoordinated strategy at the national, regional and global\r\nlevels in support of a strong international response to\r\nterrorism.\r\nAt the national level, the laws of Uganda make it\r\nan offence for anyone to engage in, or carry out, acts of\r\nterrorism. Similarly, anyone who aids, finances,\r\nharbours or renders support in the commission,\r\npreparation or instigation of acts of terrorism commits\r\nan offence. All these offences carry life imprisonment\r\nas a penalty. Uganda will also be taking urgent\r\nmeasures to implement the Security Council resolution\r\nagainst terrorism, resolution 1373 (2001). The Ugandan\r\nParliament has been urged to act quickly and resolutely\r\nto enact domestic measures to implement international\r\nconventions and plug the loopholes in existing laws to\r\ndeal with sophisticated terrorist methods and their\r\nfinancing mechanisms, and to create an effective and\r\nsustained deterrence to terrorism in Uganda.\r\nThe 11 September events caused tragedy not only\r\nfor the United States of America, but also for the other\r\n85 nations whose citizens perished in the World Trade\r\nCenter. In a broader sense, therefore, the terrorist\r\nattack on that day was an attack on the international\r\ncommunity. The United Nations must take the\r\nnecessary measures to eliminate terrorism as a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. The United Nations\r\nmust use its unique position to build a truly multilateral\r\ncoalition that will create a legitimate global framework\r\nfor a well coordinated and sustained fight against\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe international community has already\r\nconcluded 12 international conventions designed to\r\nstrengthen the legal framework for international\r\ncooperation in combating terrorism. Uganda has\r\nalready signed and ratified the aviation conventions\r\nand protocols against terrorism and, as a matter of\r\npriority, Uganda is determined to work with the rest of\r\nthe international community to become a party to the\r\nrest of the conventions.\r\nUganda calls upon the international community to\r\ncarefully adopt strategies to fight terrorism through\r\neffective implementation of United Nations anti-\r\nterrorism conventions, and welcomes Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) as a new and concrete measure\r\nto counter the new challenges from the ever-changing\r\nface of terrorism guided by criminal individuals,\r\norganizations and States.\r\nUganda further calls on the United Nations to:\r\nmove rapidly to strengthen and finalize the draft\r\nconvention on the suppression of nuclear terrorism and\r\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism;\r\ndeclare terrorism a crime against humanity and\r\nestablish an international mechanism to punish those\r\nresponsible for carrying out or assisting terrorist\r\nactivities; and mobilize the necessary global resources\r\nto enable the developing countries, and especially the\r\nleast developed countries, to design and build national\r\nand regional mechanisms and capacities to implement\r\nUnited Nations conventions and resolutions against\r\nterrorism.\r\nAs we confront the scourge of terrorism, the\r\nUnited Nations must continue to address conditions\r\nthat give rise to hatred, depravity, extremism and\r\nfundamentalism. Indeed, the United Nations should\r\nseek to achieve the millennium targets, including\r\naddressing, among other things, the causes of conflict,\r\nignorance, disease and poverty.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that terrorism is\r\na crime against humanity. Terrorism is morally and\r\nethically indefensible. Under no circumstances must\r\nwe seek to justify the killing of innocent people for any\r\npolitical cause. Terrorism is an international problem\r\nthat requires a coordinated, multisectoral and\r\nmultidimensional response at the national, regional and\r\nglobal levels. Let us make it clear that the Members of\r\nthe United Nations have the courage, the technology\r\nand the political will to take collective, appropriate,\r\nprompt and adequate measures in response to the\r\nscourge of terrorism. Let us send a strong message to\r\nthe terrorists, their supporters and their sympathizers\r\nthat the United Nations can and will act decisively\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nThe people of the Republic of Uzbekistan grieves with\r\nthe people of the United States in the aftermath of the\r\ninhuman acts of terror perpetrated on 11 September in\r\nNew York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. In a\r\nletter addressed to the President of the United States,\r\nGeorge W. Bush, the President of Uzbekistan, Islam A.\r\nKarimov, condemned those barbaric acts and stressed\r\nthe importance of international efforts to combat the\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nterrible scourge of terrorism and his willingness to join\r\nin such efforts.\r\nThis unprecedented act of terrorist aggression\r\nposes a cruel challenge to all mankind. The number of\r\nvictims is unprecedented: more than 6,000 people from\r\n60 countries died, including people from Uzbekistan.\r\nUnfortunately, Uzbekistan knows from bitter\r\nexperience how horrendous terrorism is. The\r\nexplosions that echoed on 16 February 1999 in our\r\ncapital of Tashkent — carried out by the same forces\r\nresponsible for the events of 11 September — shed\r\nparticularly stark light on the important need to enable\r\nour State to combat this threat. The Government and\r\nthe Parliament are carrying out needed reform,\r\nincluding legislative reform, to help provide security\r\nfor our people, our society and our State, to protect our\r\ncountry’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to\r\nmaintain law and order and national concord.\r\nInternational terrorism, extremism, aggressive\r\nnationalism and separatism are dangerous detonators of\r\nbombshells against international peace, security and\r\nstability. We are witnessing a strengthening of the\r\nhorrendous link between international terrorism and\r\ntransnational organized crime, the trade in drugs and\r\nweapons, and money-laundering.\r\nThe defiant actions of international terrorist\r\norganizations suggest that they may possess and be\r\nwilling to use nuclear, chemical and biological\r\nweapons. The consequences of terrorist use of weapons\r\nof mass destruction are unimaginable.\r\nIn last year’s Millennium Declaration, heads of\r\nState or Government expressed their determination to\r\ntake coordinated action to combat international\r\nterrorism. There has been significant progress in\r\nformulating international legal instruments to combat\r\ninternational terrorism. Uzbekistan is a full party to all\r\n12 current international anti-terrorism conventions and\r\nprotocols. But in the light of the current growing threat\r\nand challenge posed by international terrorism, it is\r\nbecoming vital for the General Assembly to work\r\nspeedily towards the adoption of the two international\r\ninstruments now under discussion: a comprehensive\r\nconvention to combat international terrorism, and a\r\ndraft convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism.\r\nToday, the facts show that to fight terrorism it is\r\nnot enough merely to formulate and adopt international\r\ninstruments. We believe that to achieve effective\r\nresults in the fight against terrorism we must set up a\r\nglobal system of cooperation within the United\r\nNations. Here, one fact stands out: items on combating\r\ninternational terrorism are now on the agenda of the\r\nSecurity Council. There is no doubt that Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) was an important\r\nmilestone on the road to such a global system; it\r\nproposed the establishment of an international\r\nmechanism to monitor implementation by all States of\r\nUnited Nations anti-terrorism decisions. We support\r\nthat Security Council resolution and hope that the\r\nresulting mechanism will be effective.\r\nBut we are certain that we must supplement that\r\nby enhancing the capacity of the United Nations to\r\ncombat international terrorism, by strengthening and\r\ndeveloping existing structures within the United\r\nNations system. Here, we believe that the Security\r\nCouncil should be actively supported by a specialized\r\nUnited Nations body that would provide information\r\nand analytical and technical support for the\r\nimplementation of Council anti-terrorism resolutions.\r\nAt the fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly, in 1998, we proposed the establishment\r\nwithin the United Nations system of a committee for\r\nthe prevention of terrorist activities and for combating\r\ninternational terrorism. That idea has been further\r\ndeveloped in the light of the urgent need for the\r\ninternational community to step up its campaign\r\nagainst the growing threat of international terrorism.\r\nTwice — at the Istanbul summit of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and at the\r\nMillennium Summit — the President of the Republic of\r\nUzbekistan, Islam A. Karimov, offered an initiative to\r\nestablish an international centre to combat terrorism.\r\nIn its statement of 13 September 2001, following\r\nthe events of 11 September, the Ministry for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Uzbekistan submitted to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral a proposal to take effective, urgent measures to\r\ncreate such a centre. The need to do so was noted also\r\nin the Final Document of the International Conference\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe, entitled “Enhancing\r\nSecurity and Stability in Central Asia: An Integrated\r\nApproach to Counter Drugs, Organized Crime and\r\nTerrorism”, which took place in Tashkent on 19 to 20\r\nOctober 2000. A large group of States expressed their\r\nsupport for that initiative. However, it has not yet been\r\npractically implemented.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nThe main task of the proposed centre would be to\r\nprovide technical and consultative services to States\r\nand to international and regional organizations on the\r\nimplementation of the provisions of international\r\ninstruments and decisions of the United Nations in\r\ncombating both the phenomenon of international\r\nterrorism and the forces that support, finance, facilitate\r\nand organize it.\r\nWe see this centre as an international structure,\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, that would\r\ncompile and disseminate among States Members of the\r\nOrganization and other interested States, as well as\r\nother international and regional organizations,\r\ninformation and analytical material on actions taken in\r\nthe area of international terrorism.\r\nI should like to draw the Assembly’s attention to\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General dated 26 July 2000,\r\nentitled “Measures to eliminate international\r\nterrorism”, in which concern is expressed about a lack\r\nof human and financial resources in the Terrorism\r\nPrevention Branch of the United Nations Office for\r\nDrug Control and Crime Prevention in Vienna. This\r\ndefinitely makes it more difficult, to put it mildly, to\r\nimplement its mandate.\r\nGiven the desire to find a more rational and\r\nexpeditious way to step up cooperation and\r\ncoordination within the United Nations system in the\r\ntask of preventing terrorism, we believe that it would\r\nbe a good idea to transform the Terrorism Prevention\r\nBranch into an international centre to combat terrorism,\r\nas part of the United Nations Office for Drug Control\r\nand Crime Prevention, similar to the existing Centre\r\nfor Crime Prevention.\r\nI wish to note that this proposal to strengthen and\r\nenhance the status of the existing anti-terrorist\r\nstructure within the Secretariat has been supported in\r\nthe statements made by a number of States during this\r\nplenary meeting of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are convinced that only by pooling our efforts\r\ncan we successfully combat international terrorism.\r\nThis will require the elaboration of coordinated global\r\nmeasures and possibly a global plan of action. In this\r\ncontext, we support the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to convene at an early date a high-level\r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations to\r\ndevise a plan for joint organized action by the\r\ninternational community to combat terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations. We are convinced that such a\r\nconference would facilitate the constructive\r\nconsideration and adoption of urgent strategies and\r\nmeasures to eliminate international terrorism.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): The Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan strongly condemns the heinous crimes\r\ncommitted against innocent civilians on 11 September.\r\nThese terrorist acts represent a direct challenge not\r\nonly to the people of the United States but to the entire\r\ncivilized world, and they constitute barbaric assaults on\r\nhuman decency, freedom and democracy.\r\nAzerbaijan, together with other nations\r\nthroughout the world, mourns the victims of these\r\nattacks and expresses its solidarity with the people of\r\nthe United States.\r\nIn his statement of 12 September 2001, President\r\nHeydar Aliyev stressed:\r\n“The horrible acts of terror that were\r\ncommitted in New York and Washington deeply\r\nshocked and saddened the Azerbaijani people. At\r\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century, which\r\nhumankind entered with high expectations,\r\nterrorism has emerged, in an unprecedented\r\nmanner, as a global crime that recognizes no\r\nborders and is contrary to all human values.\r\nWhile the United States is the target today, such a\r\ntragedy could potentially befall all nations and\r\npeoples. The people of Azerbaijan, who have\r\nthemselves experienced the terrifying and painful\r\nconsequences of terrorism, understand the\r\nsuffering of the friendly American people and\r\nshare in their immeasurable grief.”\r\nAzerbaijan has repeatedly and unequivocally\r\ncondemned, in the strongest possible terms,\r\ninternational terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, for whatever purpose and by whomever\r\nperpetrated.\r\nIn conducting joint actions and operations against\r\nterrorists, Member States should unite on the basis of\r\nprinciples rather than on the basis of their temporary or\r\nnarrow national interests.\r\nIn this regard, Azerbaijan would like to underline\r\nthe following principles.\r\nFirst, Member States should unequivocally and\r\nunambiguously condemn terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, as well as any support or recognition of\r\nterrorism or failure to condemn it directly.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nSecond, terrorism is a transnational menace that\r\nthreatens the lives of peoples and undermines the\r\nsecurity, territorial integrity, unity and sovereignty of\r\nStates.\r\nThird, in the long run, and as an ultimate goal, the\r\ninternational community should not only fight against\r\nterrorist organizations and individuals, but also should\r\ndo its utmost to eliminate the causes of terrorism,\r\nwhich are mostly of a political nature.\r\nFourth, nothing can justify terrorism and nothing\r\ncan be used as a pretext to engage in it.\r\nFifth, the international community should fight\r\nagainst those who have chosen terror as a means to\r\nachieve their political goals.\r\nSixth, terrorism is adopted and widely practised\r\nby separatist regimes and illegal entities. Such groups,\r\nusing areas under their control, are engaged in and\r\nprofiting from illicit drug trafficking, the illicit arms\r\ntrade, trafficking in human beings, money-laundering\r\nand other kinds of criminal and illegal economic\r\nactivities. The money obtained is being used for the\r\nfinancing of terrorism. Therefore, there is a vital need\r\nfor the international community to consolidate and\r\ndirect its efforts to eliminate aggressive separatism and\r\nother forms of extremism.\r\nSeventh, the fight against each and every terrorist\r\norganization, regardless of the scope of its activities,\r\nshould be waged on a global scale. Purposeful activity\r\nmust be carried out consistently on the part of the\r\ninternational community to flush out and combat\r\nterrorist organizations, groups and persons who have\r\nchosen terror as a tool for achieving their goal. To this\r\nend, the United Nations has to take the lead in\r\nelaborating a programme of action against international\r\nterrorism and in compiling a comprehensive list of\r\nterrorist organizations.\r\nThe phenomenon of terrorism has to be\r\nconsidered beyond its religious and cultural context.\r\nWe all are well aware of the numerous acts of terrorism\r\nwitnessed in many parts in the world which clearly\r\nprove this.\r\nEighth, as a primary task, there is an urgent need\r\nfor consolidated efforts to prevent the training,\r\nassistance to and financing of terrorist organizations\r\nand groups in the territories of any given State,\r\nparticularly giving terrorists refuge and protection.\r\nAzerbaijan has maintained its firm position\r\nagainst international terrorism. By joining the global\r\nanti-terrorist coalition, my country reconfirmed its\r\nreadiness to do its utmost and to contribute to the\r\nefforts of the international community to uproot this\r\nevil. In this regard, Azerbaijan fully supports General\r\nAssembly resolution 56/1 and Security Council\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001). In their\r\ncontext, I am pleased to inform this body that today,\r\nhere at United Nations Headquarters, Azerbaijan\r\nsigned the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\r\nI will now speak on behalf of the States of the\r\nGeorgia Uzbekistan Ukraine Azerbaijan Moldova\r\nGroup (GUUAM). From the very inception of the\r\nGUUAM, the proper addressing of terrorism has\r\nalways been the top priority of this grouping. It is\r\nworth mentioning that combating international\r\nterrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking is one\r\nof the main objectives of the GUUAM Charter, signed\r\nby the Presidents of those States at their summit, held\r\nin July 2001 in Yalta, Ukraine, and contained in\r\ndocument A/55/992.\r\nIn their joint statement regarding the terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September, the GUUAM States\r\nunanimously stressed that\r\n“a challenge was posed not only to the United\r\nStates of America, but to the entire world\r\ncommunity. The GUUAM States firmly condemn\r\nthe actions of the terrorists and advocate that the\r\nforces which support terrorist acts should be\r\nsubjected to the severe punishment which they\r\ndeserve.\r\n“The events of 11 September demonstrated\r\nwith merciless clarity the need to establish\r\nconditions in the system of international relations\r\nwhich would exclude the possibility of a\r\nrepetition of such tragedies. The GUUAM States\r\nare prepared to participate actively in the\r\nconsolidation of the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity in the struggle against international\r\nterrorism.” (A/46/405)\r\nAs the Secretary-General mentioned in his\r\nopening statement on 1 October,\r\n“The task now is to build on that wave of human\r\nsolidarity to ensure that the momentum is not lost\r\nand to develop a broad, comprehensive and above\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nall sustained strategy to combat terrorism and\r\neradicate it from our world.” (A/56/PV.12)\r\nAs an item for consideration, the GUUAM States\r\nwould like to reiterate their view that there is a need\r\nfor a proper international anti-terrorist institution with\r\nthe primary task of complementing the individual\r\nefforts of States in combating international terrorism\r\nand of assisting them in implementing relevant legal\r\ninstruments in the most efficient manner. We hope that\r\nthe General Assembly will take up this issue in due\r\ntime.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): Not\r\na single disaster of any magnitude that has been\r\nwrought on this planet by the cataclysms of nature; not\r\na single internal armed conflict of the kind that, every\r\nyear, grinds hundreds of human lives and fates in its\r\nmillstones; not a single one of the shocks that have\r\noccurred on the international financial markets in\r\nrecent decades could have elicited such a powerful and\r\nunited reaction from the world community as did the\r\nhorrendous terrorist acts that took place on 11\r\nSeptember, leading to enormous loss of life,\r\ndestruction and harm to New York, Washington, D.C.\r\nand Pennsylvania.\r\nThe unprecedented terrorist act of aggression\r\nsuffered by the United States and the deaths of entirely\r\ninnocent people from more than 60 countries could not\r\nfail to arouse the enraged indignation of all people of\r\ngood will and the harshest condemnation of the\r\ninstigators and organizers of this appalling act of\r\nviolence against mankind.\r\nThe people of Tajikistan were acquainted in the\r\nrecent past with all of the horrors of civil war and have\r\noften felt the cruel assaults of international terrorists.\r\nWe learned of the tragedy of the American people with\r\npain in our hearts.\r\nPresident Emomali Rakhmonov, in conveying the\r\nsincere condolences of the Tajik people to President\r\nGeorge Bush, all the victims and the bereaved families,\r\nexpressed our complete solidarity with the people of\r\nthe United States and our willingness to engage in\r\nclose cooperation with the United States Government\r\nand other States in actions to combat and eradicate\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nTajikistan decisively condemns and rejects\r\nterrorism in all its manifestations. We believe that\r\nevery terrorist act is completely unjustified; it is a\r\ncruel, ugly crime against mankind and a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Tajikistan will do its\r\nutmost to support efforts to undertake and carry\r\nthrough measures to hold the organizers and\r\nperpetrators of these terrible acts to account before the\r\nlaw, in accordance with the norms of international law.\r\nOur Government has a deep understanding of the\r\ndanger posed to the entire civilized world and to\r\nmankind by international terrorism. It is clear to all\r\ntoday that we can put an end to that phenomenon,\r\nwhich is alien to human civilization, and overcome this\r\nperfidious enemy and clandestine monster only if we\r\npool our efforts.\r\nThe President of Tajikistan has repeatedly urged\r\nthe community of nations from this very rostrum to\r\npool its efforts in combating the world terrorism\r\nunderground and to establish a global system to counter\r\nthose who dream of turning back the clock, seek to\r\nintimidate mankind and want to stop our forward\r\ndevelopment. My country is a party to the Treaty on\r\nCooperation among States Members of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States in Combating\r\nTerrorism and makes a significant contribution, within\r\nthe framework of the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization, to the emerging regional structure to\r\ncounter international terrorism. We are also\r\nparticipating actively in the international coalition now\r\nbeing formed to combat international terrorism.\r\nTajikistan believes that a united response to the\r\nforces of evil must demonstrate the loyalty of the\r\ncommunity of nations to the basic principles of\r\nmultilateralism and humanitarian ethics. We must be\r\nconsistent and sincere in our struggle against the\r\nterrorism international. Political hypocrisy and self-\r\nisolation will pander to the terrorists and lead to new\r\ncatastrophes and human suffering.\r\nIn this context, the unconditional implementation\r\nof the measures provided for in Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) is of key importance. We hope\r\nthat the Committee established by the Security Council\r\nwill become an effective and active mechanism for\r\ninternational monitoring of compliance by all States\r\nwith United Nations decisions on combating terrorism.\r\nTajikistan commends the Security Council for\r\ntaking a targeted and specific approach to the problem\r\nof international terrorism. It has laid out a principled\r\nposition and programme of action in this extremely\r\nimportant area. It is no less important in this context\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nthat the General Assembly elaborate a common\r\ninternational legal platform to counter this challenge\r\nthrough the speedy adoption of a comprehensive\r\nconvention to combat international terrorism, as well as\r\na convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism.\r\nWhile seeking answers to the question of the\r\nunderlying causes of this terrible phenomenon of\r\nterrorism, we must continue to strengthen the basis of\r\nour anti-terrorist activities. The United Nations has\r\nuniversally recognized experience in coordinating the\r\nefforts of Member States in this area, and it must play a\r\nkey role in setting up, under United Nations auspices, a\r\nglobal system to counter the large-scale threat posed by\r\ninternational terrorism. Of course, much time and effort\r\nwill be required for that. But the lofty goal of\r\ncompletely eradicating this vicious phenomenon will,\r\nwe hope, justify all of our expectations.\r\nMr. Wurth (Luxembourg) (spoke in French):\r\nSpeaking from this rostrum on 24 September, I\r\nexpressed, on behalf of my Government and\r\ncompatriots, the condolences and sympathy of the\r\npeople of Luxembourg for the attacks that took place\r\non 11 September. It is now up to this universal\r\nOrganization to shoulder its responsibility for isolating\r\nand fighting against terrorism at the global level, as\r\nwell as to undertake a huge information and education\r\ncampaign. These crimes require a three-fold response:\r\na common expression of rejection; greater awareness of\r\nour common heritage; and the definition of common\r\nsecurity measures.\r\nFirst, there is a need for rejection. The product of\r\na nihilistic fanaticism, these murders represent a\r\nrepudiation of the peoples of the world. There can be\r\nno indulgence for such acts; that would be unthinkable.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September have already\r\nchanged our lives. Countless voices from the vast\r\nmajority of countries, from both political leaders and\r\nordinary citizens, have condemned terrorism and are\r\ncalling for action to eliminate it. These voices have\r\nreaffirmed the unity of the values of humanity and\r\ncivilization that we all share.\r\nThe barbarous acts that we witnessed are the\r\nresult of blind adherence to a vision of the world\r\ninspired by hate and scorn. The authors of those acts\r\nhave no respect for people. They twist the values of\r\nreligion to deny the convergence of cultures and\r\ncivilizations. Their inability to convince and to share\r\nwith others — a trait that is inherent to all those who\r\ncommit acts of violence — contrasts with the might of\r\nthe values of cooperation and democracy, which draw\r\ntheir strength from tolerance, respect and freedom.\r\nThat strength is intact; in fact, it is stronger than ever.\r\nThe twin towers of the World Trade Center are no\r\nlonger visible. But their image is stronger than ever.\r\nThat image will come to embody for us the hope for a\r\nworld that is fairer, more tolerant and more fraternal.\r\nSecondly, the international community will arrive\r\nat a greater awareness of the ties that bind us together.\r\nThe desire for justice, which is innate in us, will help\r\nto provide us with the insight we need if we are to\r\nidentify the true challenges. The necessary security\r\nmeasures will be put in place, but the problems\r\nresulting from poverty — problems faced by men and\r\nwomen, young and old, with which they will continue\r\nto struggle — will be brought home to us in more\r\nconcrete terms. The recent tragic events will surely\r\nlead to a sharper awareness of our commonality and a\r\nrenewed resolution to reject that which divides us.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations have\r\nheard the appeal of the Secretary-General: the struggle\r\nagainst the scourges of our times — conflict,\r\nignorance, poverty and disease — will intensify. The\r\nworld will show that it can prevail and create a society\r\nthat is more just, charitable, authentic and resilient.\r\nThis concerted response must find its expression in\r\nboth international and national law. If the idea of a\r\ncrime against humanity is to make any sense, it cannot\r\nignore the events of 11 September. At the national\r\nlevel, the construction of stable States, based on\r\ndemocratic legitimacy and law, will provide a solid\r\nfoundation for lasting development and for the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism and hatred. The lesson that we can\r\nnow learn from those events is that large-scale\r\nterrorism is a phenomenon that transcends boundaries\r\nand therefore requires a global response.\r\nThe United States of America introduced\r\nproposals in this connection, and the Security Council\r\nadopted them. It is fortunate that the greatest Power\r\nplaces the defence of its interests within the framework\r\nof a common effort to which all countries of the world\r\nare party. The recent attacks have shown how\r\nvulnerable modern society is in the face of the\r\ndetermination of well-organized groups. Given the\r\nnature of the threat, which might strike anywhere and\r\nat any time, both the immediate and the long-term\r\nresponse must be collective. This universal\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nOrganization is the indispensable focal point for the\r\nconstruction of a partnership to combat this scourge, as\r\nwell as for action to root out hatred. It is our duty to\r\nensure that the common interest prevails over division.\r\nThe United States of America can count on more than\r\nthe passing solidarity of the other nations, and they can\r\nexpect full cooperation in the construction of a more\r\nstable and safer world.\r\nThe necessary security measures will be\r\nundertaken. This universal Organization reacted\r\npromptly after 11 September. In the wake of the\r\nattacks, the Secretary-General spoke on our behalf with\r\ndignity and sobriety, and we are deeply grateful to him\r\nfor that. The General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil adopted resolutions within 36 hours of the\r\nevents and, speaking with one voice, called for\r\ninternational cooperation to bring to justice those who\r\nwere responsible for or complicit in those terrorist acts.\r\nThe Security Council adopted a further resolution, and\r\nwe are now considering ways to strengthen\r\ninternational instruments so as to prevent such acts in\r\nthe future.\r\nDuring the course of many recent ministerial-\r\nlevel meetings, the European Union emphasized that\r\nthe struggle against terrorism requires a response at all\r\nlevels — national, regional and international. On 21\r\nSeptember, the European Council, meeting at the level\r\nof heads of State or Government, reaffirmed the\r\nlegitimacy of a response and the urgency of taking joint\r\naction. The solidarity of Europe with the United States,\r\nand its determination to cooperate within a broad\r\ninternational coalition, are assured. The Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Belgium, whose country will hold\r\nthe rotating presidency of the European Union until the\r\nend of the year, also spoke on our behalf when, from\r\nthis rostrum, he provided details about the measures\r\ndecided upon in Europe.\r\nEffective international legal cooperation will be\r\nan important component of the struggle against crime\r\nin general and against terrorist networks in particular.\r\nLuxembourg is fully involved in that effort.\r\nWithout mentioning terrorism as such, terrorist\r\nacts are considered and punished by the provisions of\r\nthe Luxembourg penal code, including those on crimes\r\nagainst State security, on violations of legislation\r\ndealing with arms and munitions, on the taking of\r\nhostages and on voluntary and involuntary assault and\r\nbattery. The penal code criminalizes the constitution of\r\nassociations of criminals and criminal organizations, as\r\nwell as participation in their activities. Financing of\r\nthese criminal activities is considered an act of\r\nparticipation or complicity.\r\nWe must underscore that the authors and\r\naccomplices of terrorist or criminal acts can never be\r\nprotected by banking confidentiality. In fact, the law\r\nexpressly provides that confidentiality ceases in the\r\npenal area and in court. All professionals in the\r\nfinancial sector are legally obliged to cooperate fully\r\nwith the authorities in charge of law enforcement, who,\r\nin turn, cooperate with their counterparts abroad. The\r\nlaw on money-laundering regulates cooperation on the\r\npart of the financial sector with the competent\r\nauthorities. This legislation contains an obligation to\r\nverify the identity of actors and the origin of funds. It\r\nrequires mandatory notification to the legal authorities\r\nof all facts that might indicate the existence of a crime\r\nin relation to funds. Crimes and offences committed\r\nwithin the framework of a criminal organization or an\r\nassociation of criminals constitute a major violation of\r\nthe laws against money-laundering.\r\nThe legislation of Luxembourg also provides for\r\nvery strict conditions for access to the financial sector,\r\nspecifically as regards the identity and moral character\r\nof stockholders and executives of financial institutions.\r\nSince the decision of the United States President\r\non 24 September to freeze the assets of a certain\r\nnumber of persons and organizations suspected of\r\nhaving links to terrorism, the authorities of\r\nLuxembourg have forbidden banks and professionals in\r\nthe financial sector from undertaking transactions with\r\npersons and organizations so involved and have\r\nordered them to report all useful information in this\r\narea to the monitoring authorities and the legal\r\nauthorities. The blocking of bank assets of these\r\norganizations and persons has been ordered. The\r\nGovernment of Luxembourg has expressed to the\r\nUnited States once again its determination to cooperate\r\nclosely to guarantee a prompt exchange of useful\r\ninformation in connection with the struggle against the\r\nfinancing of terrorism. After the verifications carried\r\nout proactively and in concert with the American\r\nauthorities, no real link between the financial sector\r\nand terrorists or their financiers have been proven to\r\ndate.\r\nThe 12 international conventions directed against\r\ninternational terrorism must be implemented, and their\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nimplementation must be immediate. The necessary\r\nratification procedures, which are sometimes difficult,\r\nreinforce our dedication to the international rules\r\ndefined jointly. On 20 September Luxembourg signed\r\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism and will try to ratify it as soon\r\nas possible. Other conventions have been signed at the\r\nregional level. On 26 September 2001, Luxembourg\r\njoined the European Convention on Laundering,\r\nSearch, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from\r\nCrime.\r\nOur will to cooperate with our partners in the\r\nstruggle against terrorism in general and terrorism\r\nfinancing in particular is also documented by a\r\nveritable legal and juridical arsenal in place for many\r\nyears, and which is in the process of being adapted by\r\nimplementing commitments undertaken with the\r\nEuropean Union and at the international level.\r\nThe authorities of my country are firmly resolved\r\nto participate fully in the action of the international\r\ncommunity against terrorism; they will make their\r\ncontribution to ensure that joint action by the\r\ninternational community will be crowned as soon as\r\npossible by convincing results.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic): Allow me to convey our congratulations to\r\nthe President on his assuming the presidency of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to wish\r\nhim every success in his important tasks. He has\r\nalready shown at the beginning of his presidency\r\nremarkable speed of action and efficiency in the face of\r\nthe tragic events that have affected the plans for the\r\nfifty-sixth General Assembly.\r\nWe also place on record our appreciation to Mr.\r\nHarri Holkeri for his effective leadership as President\r\nof the last General Assembly.\r\nSpeaking about acts of terrorism, none of us is\r\nlikely to forget the terrorist attacks of 11 September in\r\nNew York, Washington and Pennsylvania, which\r\ncaused tremendous casualties in lives and assets. In the\r\nwake of these tragic events, on 12 September 2001, on\r\nbehalf of the Government and people of the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Mr. Khamtay\r\nSiphandone, President of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, sent a message of condolence to the\r\nPresident of the United States of America, expressing\r\nhis profound sorrow to the United States Government\r\nand the families of the victims, reaffirming our\r\nconsistent policy to cooperate with the international\r\ncommunity in the struggle against terrorism.\r\nAny terrorist attack, wherever and by whomever\r\nit is committed, must be seen not only as an assault\r\nagainst innocent people, but also as a threat to the\r\nstability of nations and to international peace and\r\nsecurity. It affects the very basis of societies and\r\nimpedes the full enjoyment of basic human rights and\r\nthe fundamental freedoms of people. Indeed, the\r\nconsequences of terrorist attacks are unspeakable. In\r\nthis vein, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic joins\r\nother nations in condemning terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations and supports the implementation of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1, which calls for\r\ninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorism.\r\nThe challenge we are facing now assumes a\r\nworldwide dimension. It is, therefore, important to\r\nensure that our response to it should be organized in a\r\nway that brings justice and strengthens international\r\npeace and security based on general principles of\r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United\r\nNations. In this fight, the United Nations should play a\r\ncrucial role and address the issue more effectively at its\r\ncurrent session and beyond.\r\nIn light of the increasingly sophisticated and\r\nextensive network of organized terrorist acts, the\r\ninternational community more than ever before needs\r\nconcerted action, and this should be done through the\r\nestablishment of an effective global framework and the\r\ndevelopment of a broad and comprehensive strategy. In\r\nthis context, we welcome the Declaration on Measures\r\nto Eliminate International Terrorism under General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/60 of 1994, Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) and the existing conventions on\r\ninternational terrorism, including two international\r\nconventions, one for the suppression of terrorist\r\nbombing and the other for the suppression of the\r\nfinancing of terrorism. The adoption of these important\r\ninstruments is clear testimony to this endeavour.\r\nWe also applaud the efforts of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee to reinforce the legal regime for countering\r\ninternational terrorism and welcome the Indian\r\nproposed draft for a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism. We hope that, in order to meet\r\nthe challenge before us, this draft convention, now\r\nunder negotiation, can soon be finalized, clearly laying\r\ndown an effective mechanism whereby a State party\r\ncan exercise jurisdiction over terrorist offences,\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nensuring that the alleged offender will be brought to\r\njustice and not escape punishment, and enhancing\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe early adoption and entry into force of this\r\nconvention will generate momentum for the\r\ninternational community in its fight against terrorism\r\nand provide an important framework for national and\r\ninternational actions geared to combat this evil. We\r\nwill continue to work closely and positively with all\r\nother delegations to ensure its early adoption.\r\nThe international community has never expected\r\nthat acts of terrorism would be carried out so\r\ndeliberately, so inhumanly and so destructively. One\r\ncountry alone, whether rich or powerful, cannot fight\r\neffectively against this scourge. The whole world must\r\nunite in its effort and work together in order to defeat\r\nit. For its part, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nstands ready and will do its utmost to contribute to this\r\nfight against terrorism in order to ensure that\r\nsucceeding generations can live without fear in a\r\npeaceful and safe world.\r\nMr. Richards (Dominica): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the 14 members States of the\r\nCaribbean Community that are members of the United\r\nNations: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados,\r\nBelize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica,\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nThe Caribbean Community joins in solidarity\r\nwith all member States in condemning the vicious and\r\ndiabolical terrorist acts on New York, Washington,\r\nD.C., and Pennsylvania, on 11 September 2001. The\r\nterror of those acts has resonated throughout the\r\ninternational community, as many foreign nationals,\r\nincluding some of our own from the Caribbean, are\r\ncounted among the missing and the dead. These were\r\nnot only assaults on the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica. These were attacks on all civil society and\r\nhumankind.\r\nWhile we have only begun to address the grief\r\nand sorrow for the loss of lives suffered in those\r\nattacks, some of us have been shocked into realization\r\nand others sadly are reminded of the macabre nature of\r\nterrorism. Terrorism breeds within societies and\r\nexploits the infrastructure of democracy, freedom and\r\ntolerance. It releases its wrath upon the innocent\r\nunknowing, intending to infiltrate those societies and\r\ntheir infrastructure and thus perpetuating economic and\r\nhumanitarian crises.\r\nWe are all vulnerable to international terrorism in\r\nwhatever form and regardless of its immediate target.\r\nTogether we must take concerted action to respond\r\nvigorously to this threat to the international community\r\nand the fundamental values of democracy, peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe international community has advanced a\r\nunited approach in the struggle against international\r\nterrorism. We recall Security Council resolutions 1373\r\n(2001) and 1368 (2001) and General Assembly\r\nresolution 56/1, as well as the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS) resolution on “strengthening\r\nhemispheric cooperation to prevent, combat and\r\neliminate terrorism” and the OAS Declaration of\r\nSolidarity, both of 21 September 2001. The Caribbean\r\nCommunity reaffirms its support for these resolutions\r\nand declaration and endeavours to implement them.\r\nIn this context, we must continue to strengthen\r\nthe capacity of the United Nations to respond to the\r\ninternational community’s need not only to bring to\r\njustice the perpetrators and the sponsors of terrorism,\r\nbut also to put an end to such activities through\r\ninternational cooperation. Accordingly, we must\r\nestablish preventive mechanisms against terrorism and\r\nstrive for the full implementation and observation of\r\nexisting international legal instruments aimed at the\r\nprevention and eradication of terrorism and related\r\nactivities. Our strategies should be comprehensive and\r\nmultifaceted, with an overarching goal to study and\r\neliminate the causes and sources of terrorism, whether\r\npolitical, social or economic.\r\nWe fully support the work being undertaken by\r\nthe Ad Hoc Committee on terrorism to draft a\r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism. We urge\r\nthe earliest conclusion of its work so that the\r\ninternational community can move forward\r\nexpeditiously to address this scourge effectively. In the\r\nmeantime, we in the Caribbean will continue to play\r\nour parts in the effort to stamp out international\r\ncriminal activity, including illegal traffic in small arms\r\nand drugs and money-laundering. Indeed, many\r\nCARICOM States were among those that signed the\r\nConvention against transnational organized crime last\r\nweek.\r\nWe have only begun to experience the broader\r\neffects of terrorism on the conduct of our lives and on\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nthe social and economic well-being of our individual\r\nMember States. It is now more important than ever that\r\nwe work to ensure that fear and paralysis, on which\r\nterrorism thrives, does not circumscribe our decisions\r\nand actions. Let us all heed the call to seek to restore\r\nnormalcy to our daily activities. The Caribbean\r\ncommunity pledges its support to a united front to\r\ncombat terrorism in all its aspects and to cooperate in a\r\nglobal effort to restore to our people and the\r\ninternational community renewed confidence in\r\ninternational peace, security and freedom.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): Once again the report by\r\nthe Secretary-General has underscored an urgent\r\nproblem that needs decisive action by the international\r\ncommunity to combat it — the danger posed by\r\ninternational terrorism. The report clearly indicates the\r\npervasive nature of international terrorism. Innocent\r\npeople all over the world have become victims of this\r\nscourge. No country is immune to it. The danger posed\r\nby terrorism to all peoples of the world has never been\r\nmore evident. The need for international cooperation to\r\nrid mankind of this scourge has never been more\r\nurgent. The heinous acts of terrorism perpetrated on 11\r\nSeptember, is a powerful reminder and a wake-up call\r\nfor all of us. Those mindless acts killed over 6000\r\npeople from 80 countries.\r\nMy delegation would once again like to convey\r\nour condolences to the United States and the countries\r\nthat have suffered from these acts of terrorism.\r\nTerrorist acts are acts of barbarism. We fully\r\nshare the view that these acts are attacks against\r\ncivilization itself. Terrorism victimizes innocent\r\ncivilians. It makes no distinction as to whether they are\r\nwomen, children or the elderly. It undermines national\r\nstability. International terrorism has gained magnitude\r\nover the years and now poses a threat to international\r\npeace and security. Places of transportation become\r\ntargets of terrorism. Railroads and highways are mined,\r\nkilling innocent commuters. Embassies find themselves\r\nbecoming targets of terrorism.\r\nMyanmar has also suffered from these heinous\r\nacts. We became victims of international terrorism\r\nwhen a powerful bomb exploded at our Martyr\r\nMausoleum, in an attempt to assassinate a visiting\r\nHead of State on Myanmar soil. Myanmar stands\r\ntotally against terrorism in all forms and\r\nmanifestations. Our criminal code, capital punishment\r\nfor high crimes and other special laws form a solid\r\nlegal basis to deter and combat terrorism. We are also\r\nvigorously enforcing them.\r\nHowever, terrorism is a global phenomenon. We\r\nneed a joint organized response of the international\r\ncommunity. I am heartened that the recent terrorist acts\r\nhave resulted in swift and effective measures by the\r\nUnited Nations. This Assembly has passed a resolution,\r\nand the Security Council has passed two resolutions to\r\ncombat this global menace.\r\nInternational terrorism is a threat to peace and\r\nsecurity. Therefore, the United Nations should play a\r\nleading role in combating it. To deal with the changing\r\ncircumstances, we must also strengthen the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations and international agencies dealing\r\nwith terrorist matters, such as the Terrorism Prevention\r\nBranch of the Centre for International Crime\r\nPrevention, the International Civil Aviation\r\nOrganization (ICAO), the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) and Interpol.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) set out\r\ndetailed measures, within the Charter, to combat\r\ninternational terrorism effectively. It specifically calls\r\nfor Member States to cooperate in suppressing the\r\nfinancing of terrorism, in criminal investigations and in\r\nthe exchange of information on possible terrorist acts.\r\nIt will no longer be possible for terrorists to take\r\nadvantage of humanitarian concerns and operate under\r\nthe guise of refugees.\r\nThere can be no excuse for terrorism. It must not\r\nbe condoned on any grounds whatsoever. We\r\nrecognize, however, that poverty breeds discontent and\r\nalienation. Poverty alleviation could be an effective\r\nmeasure in our efforts to combat terrorism. Here, it is\r\npertinent to recall that our leaders in their Millennium\r\nDeclaration resolved to halve the number of poor by\r\n2015. In our fight against terrorism we must address\r\nthe issue of development.\r\nMy country has always opposed and will always\r\noppose terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nWe are firm in our resolve to fight this menace through\r\ncloser cooperation with the United Nations and hand in\r\nhand with all other countries.\r\nMr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): Allow me\r\nfirst to convey to the President heartfelt congratulations\r\nin his election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to assure him of the full support of my\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\ndelegation in the performance of his duties. Allow me\r\nalso to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report of 3 July 2001 contained in\r\ndocument A/56/160, which takes stock of progress\r\nmade in various areas relating to this item.\r\nToday’s discussion is a timely one, since it is\r\noccurring just a few weeks after the bloody attacks that\r\nplunged the United States into grief on 11 September,\r\ncausing a great loss of life among people of many\r\nnationalities.\r\nI wish to recall here that the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Mali, in a statement of 13 September 2001,\r\nstrongly condemned these heinous acts and expressed\r\nsolidarity to the people and Government of the United\r\nStates. A minute of silence was observed in the\r\nmemory of all victims of the 11 September attacks\r\nduring the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of\r\nthe independence of Mali.\r\nIn addition to being tragic, the events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 remind us of the fragility of the\r\ninternational system in the face of the threat to\r\ninternational peace and security posed by international\r\nterrorism. These events also remind us of the burning\r\nneed to make a comprehensive, concerted and\r\nsustained effort to deal with it.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation welcomes the\r\noutstanding work done by the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nestablished by resolution 51/210 to elaborate a\r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism and a\r\nconvention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism, and to consider the idea of convening an\r\ninternational conference on terrorism.\r\nConvinced that the fight against terrorism is a\r\nlong-term struggle, Mali calls for greater international\r\ncooperation within the framework of a global concerted\r\nstrategy. That strategy, which must be under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, means, of course,\r\nsigning, ratifying and acceding to existing instruments.\r\nIt also requires that members of the international\r\ncommunity with the means to do so should help\r\ndeveloping countries to strengthen their individual\r\ncapacities to combat terrorism.\r\nLikewise, we welcome the adoption of Security\r\nCouncil of resolution 1373 (2001), on 28 September\r\n2001, which puts the United Nations at the forefront of\r\nthe struggle against terrorism. The resolution\r\nrepresents an important stage in the international\r\ncommunity’s growing awareness of the need to combat\r\nterrorism, as it highlights the urgent need for States to\r\ncooperate and requires them, in particular, to put an\r\nend to financial and logistical assistance to terrorist\r\nnetworks and groups from countries harbouring\r\nterrorists.\r\nMoreover, my delegation fully support all\r\nmeasures to strengthen the Secretariat’s capacity to\r\ncombat terrorism, in particular in the areas of\r\ninformation gathering, analysis and providing support\r\nto developing countries. Similarly, my country fully\r\nsupports the proposal to convene a high-level\r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations to\r\ndevise an organized and concerted response to\r\ninternational terrorism in all of its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nI wish to conclude my statement as I began it, by\r\nreiterating Mali’s strong condemnation of terrorism in\r\nall its forms and manifestations. Mali, which is party to\r\nmany international and regional instruments to fight\r\nterrorism, will continue its struggle against terrorism\r\nwith determination, while respecting the rule of law\r\nand the rules of international law. In taking part in\r\ntoday’s deliberations, my delegation hopes that this\r\ndebate will lead to a unanimous condemnation of\r\nterrorism and to the taking of specific measures and\r\ncommitments to meet the challenge posed by terrorism\r\nto the international community.\r\nMs. Thunyani (Malawi): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating the President most warmly on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. I pledge\r\nMalawi’s support and cooperation to him as we all\r\nwork together to find sustainable solutions to the\r\nnumerous and multifaceted challenges facing\r\nhumankind.\r\nAs this is the first time that Malawi takes the\r\nfloor since the tragic acts of terrorism against the\r\nUnited States, I take this opportunity, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Malawi, to convey our\r\ndeepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the\r\nUnited States and, in particular, to the families,\r\ndependants and friends of all the innocent victims of\r\nthat profoundly inexplicable tragedy. Our thoughts and\r\nprayers go out to them all. Malawi condemns in no\r\nuncertain terms such inexcusable and senseless acts of\r\nterror, and would like to add its voice to the chorus of\r\ncalls for urgent steps to hunt down, bring to justice and\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\npunish all those responsible in one way or another for\r\nthose dastardly acts of terrorism.\r\nThe extremely sad events of 11 September on the\r\nsoil of the United States will go down in the annals of\r\nhuman history as one of the most callous and\r\ninsensitive acts of barbarism that any human being can\r\nperpetrate against another. They mark a very bad start\r\nfor the new millennium and dim our shared hopes and\r\naspirations for a stable world in which everyone’s\r\ndivine right to personal security and freedom to pursue\r\ntheir chosen social, economic, cultural and religious\r\npractices is guaranteed.\r\nTerrorist acts do not at all justify whatever cause\r\nthey purport to serve, and therefore deserve to be\r\npunished by whatever means available to the\r\ninternational community of nations. Terrorism, as\r\nevidenced in the recent uncalled for attacks against the\r\nfree and peace-loving people of our host country,\r\nstands out as the single biggest challenge to our\r\ncommon humanity. It poses a real and present threat to\r\nour very survival and clearly intends to deprive human\r\nkind for a long time to come of its most highly prized\r\ntreasure, namely, the quality of peace, security and\r\nunderstanding among nations. Those are the key\r\nunderpinnings of sustainable human progress.\r\nAs it is now evident that no country or nation is\r\nimmune to the devastating and destructive effects of\r\nterrorism, it has become all the more urgent and\r\nimperative for the international community to make\r\nresolute, concrete and collaborative efforts in support\r\nof existing and newly conceived measures to combat\r\nand eliminate terrorism, which is a threat to every\r\npositive human endeavour. There is a need for every\r\nnation to make terrorism its number one enemy and to\r\ndevote every human, intellectual and material resource\r\nto the global effort to stem its tide.\r\nTerrorism is a serious challenge to the values\r\nsystems that the civilized world stands for, and a threat\r\nto what humanity strives to achieve, namely, socio-\r\neconomic liberalism and political plurality, the rule of\r\nlaw and international peace, and stability and\r\nunderstanding for the universal common good. Every\r\nconcerted effort must therefore be made to eradicate\r\nthis deadly scourge before it brings present and future\r\ngenerations under its bondage.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to express my\r\ndelegation’s grateful appreciation to both the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council for their immediate\r\ncondemnation of those terrorist attacks responsible for\r\na colossal loss of life and the costly destruction of\r\nstrategic infrastructure in the cities affected. I also\r\napplaud all the national Governments, regional and\r\ninternational organizations and civil society world-\r\nwide for supporting the mobilization of the widest\r\npossible global coalition against terrorism.\r\nGiven that international terrorism is fast\r\nbecoming more sophisticated, ingenious and inventive\r\nin its forms, manifestations and methods of operation,\r\ncertainly no single country can fight it on its own. It is\r\ntherefore incumbent upon the United Nations to take up\r\nthe mantle of mobilizing and mandating an effective\r\nglobal campaign against this scourge. That calls for\r\nquick and resolute concrete action to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation and to muster global political\r\nwill to move beyond the usual rhetorical pledges of\r\nsupport, which frustrate progress on numerous agreed\r\nglobal programmes.\r\nIn that connection, I join delegations that have\r\nalready spoken in support of calls to inject new\r\nmomentum into the existing body of international\r\ntreaties against terrorism so as to reinforce the global\r\ncampaign against that scourge. Further, my delegation\r\nsupports the call upon the Secretary-General to see to it\r\nthat all States Members of the Organization participate\r\nactively through adherence to and efficient implementation\r\nof existing anti-terrorist legal instruments, including the\r\n1996 Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration\r\non Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism. Also\r\nimportant are other key conventions that have emerged\r\nand those that continue to be under formulation in the\r\nSixth Committee, such as the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the draft\r\nconvention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism and the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\r\nIn the current international climate, with its\r\nheightened sense of insecurity, which has serious\r\nadverse implications for global socio-economic\r\nactivities, it behoves delegations to the Sixth\r\nCommittee to set aside differences that could stifle\r\nprogress in their work and to show flexibility on their\r\nrespective national positions so as to complete the\r\nformulation of the draft comprehensive convention\r\nsponsored by India last year on measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism. That instrument would be all-\r\nencompassing and would provide a broader and better\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nframework for all the existing conventions designed to\r\ncounter terrorism.\r\nI wish in conclusion to reiterate my Government’s\r\nunequivocal condemnation of the irrational exploitation\r\nof any cause to advance the misguided extremist\r\ndesigns that have such wide-ranging destructive\r\nconsequences for the world. I also reaffirm Malawi’s\r\ntotal support for any United Nations-mandated hunt for\r\nthe perpetrators of the terrorist attacks against the\r\nUnited States, and any subsequent continued drive\r\nagainst terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): I would like first to join\r\nthose who from this rostrum have expressed their\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of the\r\nUnited States on the unprecedented loss of human life\r\nduring the 11 September terrorist attacks in New York\r\nCity and in Washington, D.C. We also extend our\r\ncondolences and sympathy to those other Member\r\nStates whose citizens lost their lives in the World Trade\r\nCenter or aboard the hijacked aircraft. Armenia\r\nstrongly condemns those crimes against all peaceful\r\ndemocratic nations and against the very idea of\r\npeaceful coexistence and a humane world order. The\r\nimplications of the tragedy do not stop with the United\r\nStates; they impact the entire world community. The\r\nperpetrators, organizers and sponsors of this outrage\r\nmust be held accountable and must be brought to\r\njustice by all available means.\r\nUnfortunately, the first resolution adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its present session had to deal\r\nwith the tragic events of 11 September. But at the same\r\ntime, that short document is unique testimony to the\r\ndetermination of the world community to fight and\r\neradicate the evil of terrorism. It is a short but strong\r\nmessage, which, to use the words of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral,\r\n“reaffirms, with all our strength, our common\r\nhumanity and the values that we share. We shall\r\nnot allow them to be overthrown”. (A/56/PV.7)\r\nWe would like to commend the Secretary-General for\r\nhis readiness to engage the whole United Nations\r\nsystem in the fight against international terrorism, and\r\nwe assure him that the Republic of Armenia will\r\nsupport and contribute to all actions undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations in that regard.\r\nArmenia welcomes Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), unanimously adopted by the Council last\r\nweek. It is a significant document which provides us\r\nwith an effective anti-terrorist mechanism and defines\r\nthe obligations of every country in the global war\r\nagainst that evil. We declare our readiness to abide by\r\nall provisions of that resolution, as well as to contribute\r\nto all anti-terrorist measures outlined in it.\r\nThe fact that international terrorists still find safe\r\nharbour in some countries makes the fight against them\r\nparticularly difficult. It is widely known that in some\r\ncountries terrorist cells are disguised as non-\r\ngovernmental organizations or charitable funds, and\r\nthat in most cases the national authorities turn a blind\r\neye to their activities, trying to use them for their own\r\nnational interests.\r\nThe United Nations, which has considerable\r\nexperience in monitoring the human rights situation\r\naround the world, could also include international\r\nterrorism in the same list of priorities. The United\r\nNations can play a very positive role encouraging\r\nMember States to exchange operational information\r\nabout the terrorists and their networks. The existing\r\nUnited Nations mechanisms in the fields of the illicit\r\ntraffic in small arms, drug control, nuclear proliferation\r\nand other areas should acquire clearly pronounced anti-\r\nterrorist accents. Particular effort should be made to\r\nprevent terrorists from getting access to weapons of\r\nmass destruction — nuclear, biological or chemical.\r\nWe cannot ignore the possibility that some terrorist\r\nnetworks are already capable of creating their own\r\nbiological and chemical weapons and facilities. It is\r\nimperative that all Member States increase their\r\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism and abide by\r\nthe principles of all the international conventions and\r\nprotocols relating to terrorism.\r\nIt is regrettable that we have to bring forward the\r\nissue of international terrorism in a year that has been\r\nproclaimed by the General Assembly as the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations. One\r\ncan assume that evil actions of such proportions are\r\ncapable of discrediting the idea of dialogue, reviving\r\ninstead the ill-fated predictions of a clash among\r\ncivilizations. The lesson that we must learn today is\r\nclear: political action and military operations can bring\r\nto justice the persons responsible for terrorist attacks,\r\nbut they cannot shake the foundations of the ideas\r\nmotivating them and poisoning their minds with hatred\r\nand anger. That is where initiatives such as the\r\ndialogue among civilizations can prove effective. But\r\nthe dialogue should not limit itself to high podiums and\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nscientific conferences; it should find immediate and\r\neffective ways to reach out to ordinary people in the\r\nstreet, who are far too often influenced by extreme\r\nnationalists and religious fanatics.\r\nArmenia is celebrating the 1,700th anniversary of\r\nits adoption of Christianity as a State religion. For 17\r\ncenturies we have adhered to a system of values deeply\r\nrooted in that religion of love and forgiveness. But we\r\nreject the narrow-mindedness of those who claim that\r\nonly one religion nourishes the ideas of freedom and\r\ndemocracy. In any religion we can find the ideals of\r\ngreat humanist values. In our view, the United Nations\r\nmust spare no effort to prevent the emerging danger of\r\nvillainizing entire nations and religions. No religion is\r\nevil. No religion justifies killing innocent people. But\r\nany religion can become a deadly weapon if utilized\r\nand manipulated where entire communities are struck\r\nby poverty, disease, illiteracy and bitter hopelessness.\r\nThe United Nations should redouble its efforts in\r\nthe fields of economic development and poverty\r\neradication, since these are the strategic battlefields in\r\nthe war against terrorism. Donor countries can\r\ncontribute to the success of that war not only by\r\nsending military force to the areas of concern, but also\r\nby providing more generous financial assistance to the\r\npoorest, directly or through United Nations agencies.\r\nIn the famous Dead Sea scrolls, written more than\r\n2,000 years ago, there is a story about the final battle in\r\nthe future between the “sons of light” and the “sons of\r\ndarkness”. That battle seems to have begun. Its\r\noutcome depends solely on our combined efforts and\r\ndetermination.\r\nMr. Slade (Samoa): Mr. Vice-President, let me\r\nsay what an honour it is to be at the rostrum while you\r\nare presiding over the Assembly.\r\nSamoa joins the rest of the world in its strong and\r\nunequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember in New York; Washington, D.C.; and\r\nPennsylvania. On behalf of my Government, I want to\r\nconvey to the people of the United States our sense of\r\nhorror and sorrow and to say that we feel most deeply\r\ntheir pain.\r\nAllow me also to express our deep admiration for\r\nthe leadership of, and for the magnificent example and\r\ncourage shown by, the American people. What we have\r\nseen of the national response in our host city in\r\nparticular is proof beyond doubt of the extraordinary\r\nstrength of this great democracy and the indomitable\r\nspirit of its people.\r\nThis was a most monstrous crime and act of\r\npremeditated evil. Thousands of innocent people were\r\nmurdered, people trapped in buildings, people given\r\nabsolutely no warning. To their families and friends —\r\nand we note that citizens of many other countries\r\nrepresented in this Hall were lost — we extend our\r\nwarm and heartfelt condolences.\r\nTerrorism is a direct and most serious threat to\r\ndemocracy, to the free exercise of human rights and to\r\neconomic and social development. This has never been\r\nclearer than in the aftermath of these terrible attacks\r\nagainst the United States.\r\nTerrorism threatens fundamental rights because it\r\nis blind to, and the very antithesis of, human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms and what is decent in society. As\r\ndemonstrated time and again, terrorism has no respect\r\nfor social order or for human life and property. The\r\nparticular difficulty for law enforcement agencies is\r\nthat terrorism takes not one but different forms. What\r\nmakes it especially dangerous today is the fanaticism\r\nthat drives it, the choice of increasingly dangerous and\r\nsophisticated weaponry, and what appears to be a\r\ncalculated preference for dramatic and lethal\r\ndevastation.\r\nThe horrific events of 11 September have served\r\nto highlight not only the need for a concerted and\r\neffective international response but have also drawn\r\nattention to the inadequacy of the traditional forms of\r\nlaw enforcement in combating it.\r\nAs others have sought to emphasize, this was an\r\nassault not just on the United States of America but on\r\nall States. It is so because it is a blow against the very\r\nprinciples this Organization stands for: international\r\norder, peace, human rights and freedoms, and the rule\r\nof law. It is, in truth, an attack on shared global values,\r\nan attack against all humanity.\r\nThat is why this is a defining moment for the\r\nUnited Nations. There needs to be an effective\r\nresponse from the international community. It must a\r\nresponse of clear and demonstrated solidarity, one that\r\nwe believe the United Nations is uniquely placed to\r\nbuild and to advance.\r\nMore than ever before we need the clear\r\ncommitment of every Member State to concrete actions\r\nagainst those responsible — actions that need to be\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\ntaken now and for the long term. In doing so, we need\r\nto keep clear the distinction between the individual\r\nperpetrators and the innocent civilians, between those\r\nwho commit these atrocities and those who may simply\r\nshare their religious beliefs, ethnicity or national\r\norigin.\r\nWe need to bear in mind that the fight against\r\nterrorism cannot be separated from the task of\r\npreventing organized crime, preventing the spread of\r\nsmall arms and other weapons, and containing and\r\nending conflict. We need also to ensure that the\r\nconditions of poverty and despair that breed ignorance,\r\nhatred, violence and extremism are properly and\r\neffectively addressed. We need above all to remain\r\nresolute in upholding the rule of law and the principles\r\nthat underpin the rule of law.\r\nThe clear affirmation of these principles and of\r\nthe norms of international humanitarian law will help\r\ndeny to the perpetrators of these crimes whatever they\r\nseek to gain from violence and destruction.\r\nThe view of my Government is that there is no\r\nroom for moral equivocation. The deliberate taking of\r\ninnocent civilian life, regardless of cause or grievance,\r\nis without justification in law and is morally\r\nunacceptable.\r\nIn this connection, we consider it essential to\r\nrenew efforts to promote the rapid entry into force of\r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nA functioning International Criminal Court for the\r\nprosecution of terrorist acts amounting to crimes\r\nagainst humanity, as we regard the attacks on the\r\nUnited States to be, would provide a vital component\r\nin the international armoury against terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations and its agencies have\r\ndeveloped a wide range of international legal\r\ninstruments that enable the international community to\r\ntake action to eradicate terrorism, including the\r\nextradition and prosecution of offenders and the\r\nsuppression of money-laundering.\r\nTwelve global conventions and protocols as well\r\nas numerous declarations have been adopted. The\r\nSecretary-General has now led the call to all Member\r\nStates to ratify and to implement all counter-terrorism\r\ninstruments. It is a call we fully support. We support\r\nalso early and concerted efforts to finalize the draft\r\ninternational convention for the suppression of acts of\r\nnuclear terrorism and to draw up a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism. Such efforts will\r\nbe in line with the strong condemnation issued from the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 12 September and the\r\nAssembly’s call for urgent action to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation to prevent and eradicate acts\r\nof terrorism.\r\n In our view, it would be a fitting conclusion to\r\nthis weeklong debate for the Assembly to issue a clear\r\nreaffirmation of urgent action, making clear the\r\nspecific steps to be taken.\r\nSamoa applauds the action taken by the Security\r\nCouncil. Rightly, the Council has declared the terrorist\r\nattacks in the United States a threat to international\r\npeace and security. The Council’s unanimous and\r\nmomentous resolution 1373 (2001), adopted last\r\nFriday, building swiftly on resolution 1368 (2001), sets\r\nout in greater detail what needs to be done. We\r\nappreciate in particular the decision to establish a\r\ncommittee to monitor implementation of resolution\r\n1373 (2001). These resolutions combine to give the\r\nclearest signal of the international community’s\r\ndetermination to take concrete action against the\r\nfinancing, training and movement of terrorists and the\r\nneed for all States to cooperate in any campaign\r\nagainst them. We believe they provide the necessary\r\nbasis to secure the broadest possible international\r\nsupport and cooperation for the global campaign\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nMr. Serbini (Brunei Darussalam): Since this is\r\nthe first time my delegation is taking the floor during\r\nthis session of the General Assembly, I should like to\r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Seung-soo\r\nHan on his well-deserved election. I offer my support\r\nin our endeavour to ensure the successful outcome of\r\nthis debate.\r\nIn the context within which we are meeting, mere\r\nwords here may pale into insignificance. Like that of\r\nall speakers, our statement is delivered against the\r\nbackground of a brutal attack against our host country.\r\nI wish to express once more the deepest sympathy of\r\nHis Majesty’s Government and the people of Brunei\r\nDarussalam to the people of the United States, to the\r\nMayor and people of New York and to all countries\r\nwhose nationals were among the victims of the terrorist\r\nattacks committed in this city. Brunei Darussalam joins\r\nother Members of the United Nations in strongly\r\ncondemning all acts, methods and practices of\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nterrorism as unjustifiable, wherever and by whomever\r\ncommitted.\r\nThe 11 September incidents showed that no\r\ncountry, big or small, is safe from terrorist attacks.\r\nTerrorism has significant effects on the stability of\r\nnations and adverse consequences for social and\r\neconomic development. Such indiscriminate acts\r\ndisrespect human life and dignity and deny peace and\r\nharmony as professed by all religions. It is therefore\r\nimportant for the international community to work\r\ntogether towards preventing and eliminating all\r\nforms of terrorism by engaging in closer cooperation\r\nand coordination among States. This calls for a\r\ncomprehensive, pragmatic and balanced approach. The\r\nuse of force should only be a last resort and should take\r\ninto account the ensuing humanitarian effects, which\r\nmay give rise to another further vicious cycle of\r\nviolence.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation welcomes and\r\nsupports the statement made by the Secretary-General\r\nthat\r\n“This Organization is the natural forum in which\r\nto build such a universal coalition. It alone can\r\ngive global legitimacy to the long-term struggle\r\nagainst terrorism.” (A/56/PV.7)\r\nFurthermore, my delegation agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the response should be through the\r\nreaffirmation of the rule of law at the international and\r\nnational levels.\r\nThe fact that all of us are here today to participate\r\nin this debate is an indication of the gravity of this\r\nissue and of our firm commitment to addressing this\r\nissue. We agree with the general sentiment expressed\r\nduring this debate that some sense of urgency should\r\nbe injected into this issue.\r\nFor the past several years, the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nestablished by General Assembly resolution 51/201 has\r\nbeen considering the issue of ways to eliminate\r\nterrorism. In this respect, it is our hope that the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee will make further progress in its work on\r\nthe draft comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism. In our view, such a convention would give a\r\nproper framework to our efforts to combat terrorism.\r\nAs an indication of our commitment, Brunei\r\nDarussalam has already acceded to six conventions\r\nrelated to terrorism and is in the final stages of\r\nacceding to the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings. We support the\r\nleading role of the United Nations in taking effective\r\nmeasures to prevent and suppress the financing of\r\nterrorist acts. At the national level, Brunei Darussalam\r\nhas already enacted and implemented measures through\r\nthe Money Laundering Order and the Criminal Conduct\r\nOrder. Moreover, meaningful and enforceable\r\nregulations of the trust, company administration,\r\ninsurance and banking industries were legislated and\r\nentered into force last year. Thus, we feel that Brunei\r\nDarussalam has already taken tentative steps to prevent\r\nand suppress the financing of terrorist activities.\r\nMr. Nesho (Albania): The terrorist attack of 11\r\nSeptember against the people of the United States,\r\ncommitted by a criminal organization and barbarians\r\nwho killed thousands of innocent people, was an attack\r\nagainst the entire civilized world, freedom and\r\ndemocracy. Albania strongly condemns this criminal\r\nact, unprecedented in the history of the world, which\r\nconstitutes a threat to international peace and security,\r\nand demands that its perpetrators be immediately\r\nbrought to justice. We owe this to the innocent victims,\r\nto the freedom and democracy that were attacked and\r\nto the victory of progressive forces against evil-doers\r\nand of all nations that love freedom and democracy.\r\nThe Albanian nation has expressed its deepest\r\ncondolences for the loss of life and its solidarity with\r\nthe United States of America and believes that nothing\r\nin the world can change the freedom-loving spirit of\r\nthe American people and their great leadership,\r\nindispensable to building a free and democratic world.\r\nIn a statement of 14 September, Mr. Ilir Meta, the\r\nPrime Minister of Albania, stated:\r\n“In the just fight of the civilized world\r\nagainst terrorism and the criminal forces of\r\ndarkness, Albania stands with the United States\r\nand our allies of the European Union by putting at\r\ntheir disposal not only its territory and military\r\nbases, but also all the necessary infrastructure and\r\nhuman resources.”\r\nTerrorism is a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity and, as such, should be fought with all the\r\nmeans, determination and cooperation of all countries.\r\nAll our nations should stand united and with a high\r\nsense of responsibility to declare an uncompromising\r\nand multifaceted war against terrorism. Albania fully\r\nsupports the action of the international community\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nagainst terrorism and stands ready to make every\r\ncontribution that will be needed.\r\nAlbania believes that the United Nations has\r\nevery opportunity and all the necessary resources to\r\nplay a leading and coordinating role in the effort of the\r\ninternational community to eradicate the scourge of\r\ninternational terrorism. In this framework, Albania is in\r\nfavour of adopting a comprehensive international\r\nconvention against terrorism. Furthermore, Albania\r\nstrongly supports Security Council resolutions 1368\r\n(2001) and 1373 (2001), which clearly demonstrate that\r\nwe should join our efforts, under Chapter VII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter to cut off the financing of\r\nterrorist organizations, to collect and exchange the\r\nnecessary information in order to prevent future\r\nterrorist attacks, to deny safe haven to terrorists and to\r\ndestroy their bases.\r\nTerrorism is a scourge that takes innocent lives,\r\nthreatens the values of humanity, human rights and\r\nfreedom and impedes development and world progress.\r\nThe fight against terrorism should rise above the\r\nindividual interests of States. Terrorism cannot be\r\njustified by differences in social development or\r\ncultural and social disparities. It can in no way be\r\nconfused with the legitimate struggle of a people for\r\nfreedom and self-determination. Equality and respect\r\nfor democratic rights, furthermore, cannot be used to\r\njustify the intransigent stance of some countries in not\r\nrespecting the rights of citizens in multi-ethnic\r\nsocieties and the principles and love of democracy\r\ntherein.\r\nAlbania, a democratic country that aspires only to\r\nintegration into Euro-Atlantic structures, not only is\r\nworking to ratify all the international instruments\r\nagainst terrorism, but also has adopted an entire range\r\nof legislation and is continuing its fight against illegal\r\ntrafficking and organized crime that can serve as a\r\nsupport for terrorist acts. The legal provisions of\r\nAlbanian criminal law condemn terrorist activity and,\r\non the basis of this legislation, there has been\r\nestablished very good and fruitful cooperation against\r\nillegal trafficking between Albanian justice and police\r\nauthorities and their neighbouring counterparts in the\r\ncountries of the European Union and in the United\r\nStates of America.\r\nFurthermore, we have speeded up the legal\r\nprocedures to facilitate Albania’s accession to the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings and the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In\r\naddition, as a Balkan country, Albania welcomes and is\r\nready to provide assistance to any regional or European\r\ninitiatives to eradicate terrorism and terrorist\r\norganizations.\r\nOn 11 September 2001, terrorists attacked the\r\nUnited States of America, one of the main founders of\r\nthe United Nations, an Organization that gathered\r\ntogether all of the countries of the world to defend\r\npeace and freedom. We — all the States Members of\r\nthe United Nations — must act together in fighting\r\nterrorism. Acting in the service of freedom and for the\r\nfuture of civilization, we must form a broad, long-term\r\ncoalition to achieve our mission. Otherwise, we will be\r\ntrapped by the dark forces of irrationality, primitivism\r\nand regression, living in fear of violence and criminal\r\nacts.\r\nAs the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, The Honourable\r\nTony Blair, said just a few days ago,\r\n“There is no compromise possible with such\r\npeople, no meeting of minds, no point of\r\nunderstanding with such terror. Just a choice:\r\ndefeat it, or be defeated by it. And defeat it we\r\nmust.”\r\nWe believe that our victory in this long fight will\r\nfurther increase the prestige and the role of the United\r\nNations in the world and bring the Organization closer\r\nto the city of New York, our host city, as well as\r\ncontribute to its speedy recovery.\r\nMr. Farhâdi (Afghanistan): The recent dramatic\r\nand terrible events started in the United States at about\r\n9 a.m. on 11 September. However, just two days\r\nearlier, on 9 September, oceans away in Afghanistan,\r\ntwo terrorists of Arab origin, posing as journalists,\r\nassassinated the greatest military leader of free\r\nAfghanistan, Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud. The\r\ndiabolic assassination plot was later unravelled and\r\nshown to be the prelude to what we all bitterly\r\nwitnessed in the United States thereafter, as the\r\nassassins were all but confirmed to have been sent by a\r\nsole mastermind: Osama bin Laden.\r\nInternational terrorists knew that Afghanistan\r\nwould be the focus of military reprisals, and thus\r\ntargeted the most valiant and towering leader of the\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nanti-Taliban and anti-bin Laden fighters, as he was\r\nwithin their immediate reach.\r\nThere are as many as 12 internationally binding\r\nconventions or protocols on combating terrorism, as\r\nwell as General Assembly resolutions on the\r\nprevention and suppression of terrorism, particularly\r\nresolution 49/60 and its annex, adopted by consensus in\r\nDecember 1994, on measures to eliminate terrorism.\r\nYet some countries have defiantly resorted to terrorism\r\nas a means of achieving their politico-military agenda;\r\nPakistan exemplifies them best. Referring to the\r\nPakistani military intelligence — the Inter-Services\r\nIntelligence (ISI) — the world-renowned expert on\r\nAfghan affairs, Mr. Anthony Davis, of Jane’s Defence\r\nWeekly, perhaps defined the situation best. In his\r\nanalysis of 26 September, he wrote:\r\n“How far the [Pakistani] ISI’s field officers will\r\nwish to cooperate in the destruction of a force\r\n[the Taliban] they helped create and sustained, is\r\nuncertain.”\r\nLet me say what we have said time and again:\r\nPakistan’s policies vis-à-vis Afghanistan, dating from\r\n1992, have been dead wrong all along. Those policies\r\nhave transformed most of the territory of Afghanistan\r\ninto a nucleus of global terrorist plans. They provided a\r\nfree hand to the Pakistani clergy whom General\r\nMusharraf himself only now — he did not do so\r\nbefore — calls “religious extremists” that support the\r\nTaliban. The Taliban still provide shelter to Osama bin\r\nLaden, their hero of jihad. Ironically, the truth is that\r\nhe is the arch-enemy of genuine Islam. Islam demands\r\nmoderation and prohibits terrorism. Killing innocents\r\nis not only un-Islamic but goes against Islam.\r\nPakistan is now harvesting a dangerously\r\nnegative by-product of its hegemonic Afghan policy.\r\nPakistan’s pursuit of a subservient regime in Kabul\r\nwith the aim of securing “strategic depth” has ended in\r\na real “strategic ditch”, as today the Pashtuns of\r\nAfghanistan see dreadful perils in Pakistani Afghan\r\npolicy.\r\nThe recent willy-nilly volte-face by Pakistan’s\r\nmilitary clique, which took place under strong pressure\r\nfrom the international community, in no way\r\nexonerates Pakistan’s ISI from the crimes against\r\nhumanity committed in Afghanistan in alliance with\r\nOsama and the Taliban mercenaries. Pakistan’s ISI is\r\nsolely responsible for creating, organizing and\r\ninstigating terrorist activities in Afghanistan and for\r\nrecruiting people to take part in them.\r\nThe religious schools in Pakistan — the\r\nmadrasahs — which are closely linked to the ISI,\r\neducate and indoctrinate terrorists, seeking to enforce\r\nPakistan’s expansionist designs in the region.\r\nIn his reports on the situation in Afghanistan over\r\nthe past two years, the Secretary-General has\r\nhighlighted the presence and the role of foreign fighters\r\nin Afghanistan, particularly those of Pakistan and\r\nOsama bin Laden. The terrorist camps that have been\r\ncreated in Afghanistan are training centres where Arab\r\nand Pakistani fighters are trained by professional ISI\r\nmilitary instructors. They are trained not only to kill\r\nAfghans, but to carry out missions in Kashmir and\r\nother countries, with the aim of waging a war\r\naccording Pakistani designs.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan considers each\r\nof the components of the Pakistani-ISI-Taliban-bin-\r\nLaden evil triangle equally responsible for the many\r\ncrimes committed against the people of Afghanistan\r\nand peoples beyond.\r\nThe criminal charges against the evil alliance put\r\nan equal burden of responsibility on each of its\r\ncomponents. The Pakistani Government, especially the\r\nISI policy makers and high-ranking military officers\r\nwho have been behind the dangerous Talibanization of\r\nthe region and the forging of alliances between bin\r\nLaden, the Taliban and extremist religious groups of\r\nPakistan, are to be considered as criminals.\r\nFurthermore, those countries, individuals and\r\nmercantilist circles that have contributed to the creation\r\nof this monster in the region must be held accountable\r\nfor their acts and deeds.\r\nThe armed resistance to the Taliban and bin\r\nLaden was not invented as a result of the events of 11\r\nSeptember in the United States. The United Front of\r\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan has had to fight the\r\nTaliban and bin Laden for the past six years. Also we\r\nhave had to resist thousands of armed Pakistani fighters\r\ncalled “volunteers”, known as the Pakistani Taliban.\r\nPakistan officially recognized the Taliban puppet\r\nregime, which was forged by Pakistan itself. Today\r\nsome 8,000 armed Pakistanis, still called “volunteers”,\r\nwho are sent by the ISI, are still fighting all over\r\nAfghanistan alongside the Taliban and bin Laden. This\r\nwas how northern cities like Maimana, Mazar-I-Sharif,\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.20\r\nKunduz and, only last year, Taluqan, were invaded by\r\nthe Taliban. The Pakistani ISI also transited into\r\nAfghanistan thousands of Arab youths to serve bin\r\nLaden.\r\nLet the following points be clear to the Assembly.\r\nFirst, the Taliban mercenaries did not participate\r\nin Afghanistan’s war of independence against the Red\r\nArmy from 1979 to 1989. At that time, many of them\r\nwere children in the Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan.\r\nSecondly, the Taliban do not represent the Afghan\r\nnation, nor do they represent the Pashtuns of\r\nAfghanistan. Rather, they have been imposed on\r\nAfghanistan by a foreign country.\r\nThirdly, the Taliban’s beliefs and thoughts require\r\nAfghanistan to return to the Middle Ages. Everyone\r\nknows about their harsh behaviour towards women and\r\ntheir hatred for women’s education.\r\nLet the following matters also be known to the\r\nAssembly and the world at large.\r\nFirst, there is no absolute ethnic majority in\r\nAfghanistan. Ethnic groups are relative minorities.\r\nSecondly, even the Pashtuns and the Tajiks each\r\nconstitute less than one third of the Afghan population.\r\nThis is the stark and irrefutable reality on the ground of\r\npresent-day Afghanistan.\r\nThirdly, the Hazaras, the Uzbeks, the Turkmen\r\nand the Baluchs also constitute major ethnic\r\ncommunities. There are many other ethnic groups.\r\nFourthly, however, all the Afghans are extremely\r\npatriotic. They do not tolerate foreign domination, even\r\nif it is disguised as religion.\r\nFifthly, the current Afghan patriotic resistance,\r\nthus comprising all ethnic groups in Afghanistan, can\r\nnever be suppressed by any demagogy or divisive\r\nintrigue.\r\nSixthly, no political system can be maintained in\r\nAfghanistan unless it is broad-based, multi-ethnic and\r\nfully representative, as called for by numerous United\r\nNations resolutions. An independent, peaceful and\r\nstable Afghanistan would inevitably serve the\r\nlegitimate interests of all neighbouring countries,\r\nincluding Pakistan.\r\nSeventhly, Pakistan has constantly advised the\r\nrest of the world to “engage” with the Taliban. This has\r\nproved to be like trying to milk a bull. Let us ask: Is\r\nany country of the world satisfied with the links it may\r\nhave established with the Taliban? In fact, the Taliban\r\nmercenaries believe that non-Taliban and foreigners\r\ncan never be right unless they act according to their\r\nwishes.\r\nEighthly, and finally, there is no good or bad\r\nTaliban that one can draw a distinction between. Once\r\nthe Taliban are defeated, nobody will be happy to be\r\ncalled Taliban.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan fully shares the\r\nviews expressed in the Assembly that the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism requires broad global cooperation. We\r\nbelieve that global efforts need to be coordinated and\r\nput into practice under the auspices of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan stands\r\nsteadfastly committed and ready to join the\r\ninternational community in its endeavour for the\r\nprevention and suppression of terrorism.\r\nI would like to conclude by launching an appeal\r\nto all member nations to genuinely help the weary\r\npeople of Afghanistan in their long, uphill battle\r\nagainst terrorism. Our people have been hit hard by\r\nterrorism throughout the dark years of the Pakistani-\r\nISI-Osama-bin-Laden mercenaries’ reign of terror.\r\nAfghanistan has been a victim and a hostage to\r\ninternational terrorism until now and is still tightly\r\nbesieged by it.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9 p.m.\r\n"
