(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 166 (continued)\r\nMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/160 and\r\nCorr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Gounaris (Greece): I would like to align\r\nmyself with the statement of the Presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union and join previous speakers in\r\ncondemning the horrendous terrorist attacks, of an\r\nunprecedented scale, that shook New York City,\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11 September.\r\nOur deepest sympathy goes to the families of those\r\nwho perished, are missing or were wounded in the\r\nground zero zone and the Pentagon. I would like to\r\nexpress our full solidarity with the Government of the\r\nUnited States and the American people over this\r\ntragedy, which challenges all of humanity.\r\nAs Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. George\r\nPapandreou, declared on 11 September,\r\n“the abhorrent terrorist attack against the\r\nAmerican people was, in fact, an attack against\r\nfree society, democracy and humanity as a\r\nwhole.”\r\nThe Greek people, with one voice, condemn the\r\nterrorist attacks, which are intended to create a new\r\nscheme of warfare that is universally unacceptable. Our\r\npainful experiences have made us even more sensitive\r\non this issue. Greece unequivocally condemns the\r\nperpetrators and sponsors of such acts of barbarism,\r\nand is ready to offer the international community all\r\npossible assistance required in order to punish those\r\nresponsible.\r\nThe carefully planned and coordinated attacks\r\nwere directed against the innocent civilian population\r\nand intended to cause the maximum loss of life of\r\nthousands of defenceless working people of the United\r\nStates as well as numerous other nationals, from all\r\nparts of the world.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the international\r\nnature and the large scale of the attack characterize it\r\nas a crime against humanity. The loss of human life,\r\nregardless of ethnicity or race, demands immediate,\r\neffective action to bring those responsible to justice\r\nand to avert any possibility of such crimes being\r\ncommitted again. The United Nations should spare no\r\neffort towards achieving our common goal of\r\npreventing and suppressing terrorist attacks wherever\r\nthey might occur.\r\nThe United Nations, bearing prime responsibility\r\nin this fight against terrorism, has acted with speed and\r\nunity. On 12 September both the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly adopted strong resolutions\r\ncondemning the attacks and calling on all States to\r\ncooperate in bringing the perpetrators to justice. On 28\r\nSeptember a second and more detailed resolution was\r\nadopted by the Security Council, building on the first.\r\nThe extensive deliberations of the plenary of the\r\nGeneral Assembly underline our willingness to\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\npromote cooperation on this issue and pursue the\r\nimplementation of these resolutions.\r\nOur collective efforts, our global cooperation and\r\naction, are now needed, more than ever, on all levels,\r\nboth nationally and internationally. The fight against\r\nterrorism should only bring the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations closer to our common goals: embracing\r\nour democratic values; cherishing our freedoms; and\r\nstrengthening development.\r\nHowever, let me clarify that any attempt to\r\nidentify this fight with one religion or equate it with\r\none region or one race, or even to single out one\r\ncountry, defeats our purpose of ensuring peace and\r\nsecurity, building more tolerance, safeguarding\r\nmulticulturalism and avoiding fragmentation.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to join forces in the\r\nglobal efforts to eliminate the horror of terrorism.\r\nGreece, as a State Party to all major international\r\nantiterrorism conventions, is currently promoting — as\r\nan addition to existing legislation concerning weapons,\r\nammunition and explosives that fully secures the\r\ncriminal prosecution and punishment of those\r\nresponsible for terrorist acts — a draft law to deal with\r\nspecific issues of organized crime and terrorist acts.\r\nMoreover, with a series of other laws, the Greek State\r\nensures the moral and material support of victims of\r\nterrorist acts and their families, and recognizes the\r\nright of the victims to be compensated by the State for\r\nmaterial damage that they have sustained by reason of\r\na terrorist act.\r\nWith our partners in the European Union, we will\r\ntake all necessary steps to reinforce our efforts and\r\npursue collective European action across all our\r\nterritories, as expressed in the conclusions and plan of\r\naction of the extraordinary European Council meeting\r\nof 21 September 2001. In particular, specific\r\nlegislation, within the framework of the Schengen\r\nConvention, has been adopted on the fight against\r\nterrorism, organized crime and drug smuggling and\r\nregarding the possession, acquisition, dealing and\r\ntrafficking in general of firearms and ammunition by\r\nindividuals or legal entities on the territory of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nHowever, our struggle to eradicate terrorism\r\nshould not lessen our efforts for development,\r\ndemocracy and human rights, especially in those parts\r\nof the world where they are most needed. On the\r\ncontrary, our universal efforts should go hand in hand.\r\nOur common endeavours should focus on addressing\r\nand resolving any regional crises, thus laying a solid\r\nground for good neighbourly relations, peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn Afghanistan, at this very moment, a\r\nhumanitarian crisis is unfolding. Greece has announced\r\nits humanitarian contribution, to be disbursed both\r\nbilaterally and multilaterally.\r\nWe trust that, at the beginning of this new\r\ncentury, the guidelines laid out by our heads of State\r\nand Prime Ministers in the Millennium Declaration\r\n“To take concerted action against international\r\nterrorism, and to accede as soon as possible to all\r\nthe relevant international conventions”\r\n(resolution 55/2, para. 9)\r\nwill prevail.\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): Thank you,\r\nMr. President, for your correct pronunciation of\r\nAntigua.\r\nSince this is the first time that I have had the\r\nhonour to address the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsixth session, permit me to offer congratulations to\r\nyou, Mr. President, on your assumption of your high\r\noffice. Your reputation of brilliance, fairness and\r\ncongeniality has preceded you to the office that you\r\nhold. My delegation is confident that, under your\r\nguidance, we will have a successful and progressive\r\nfifty-sixth session.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, I wish to associate myself with\r\nthe statement made by Mr. Simon Richards of\r\nDominica on the topic under discussion, international\r\nmeasures against terrorism. My country firmly supports\r\nthe points he emphasized, namely, the solidarity of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) with the\r\ninternational community; secondly, the nature of a\r\nglobal response; and, thirdly, CARICOM’s pledge to\r\nsupport internationally agreed measures. He\r\nemphasized that the United Nations strategy had to be\r\ncomprehensive and multifaceted, with the overarching\r\ngoal of studying and eliminating the causes and sources\r\nof terrorism, whether they be social, economic or\r\npolitical.\r\nMy country likewise endorses the Security\r\nCouncil resolution of 12 September, which called upon\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\n“States to work together urgently to bring to\r\njustice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors”\r\n(Security Council resolution 1368 (2001),\r\npara. 3)\r\nof the terrorist acts of 11 September. Likewise, Antigua\r\nand Barbuda\r\n“regards such acts, like any act of international\r\nterrorism, as a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity”. (ibid., para. 1)\r\nIt is even more distressing to learn that on\r\n1 October there was another serious terrorist attack,\r\nthis time in Jammu and Kashmir, where 40 people have\r\nso far died — among them women and children —\r\nwhile a large number of individuals remain wounded,\r\nsome seriously.\r\nThose events, and particularly those of 11\r\nSeptember, manifested the international dimensions of\r\nterrorism. It is, as stated by Mr. Kamalesh Sharma of\r\nIndia,\r\n“an organic whole; it would be dangerous to try\r\nto cut one of the cells out ... It is an evil that\r\nmetastasizes. Terrorism must be destroyed root\r\nand branch. It is the anathema of the new\r\ncentury.” (A/56/PV.16)\r\nIn conclusion, I must state that it is imperative\r\nthat we address in a more meaningful manner the\r\nunderlying social, economic and political problems that\r\ncause human misery; for, beyond being humanitarian,\r\nthis would help to remove the atmosphere in which\r\nterrorism prospers. We must act to ensure that the\r\nentire global society lives in an environment of\r\nfreedom and that it is free from fear. The fight against\r\nterrorism will be long; it will be arduous; but it is one\r\nin which we must thoroughly and completely engage\r\nourselves.\r\nMr. Ecua Miko (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): There are situations and things that demand\r\nthat everyone speak out.\r\nIn a corner of the world, villagers used a deaf\r\nmute, because of his physical strength, to do all the\r\nhard labour. On one occasion, he had been working for\r\na week at cleaning the farm of a villager who had\r\nemployed him. When it came time to pay him, the\r\nemployer paid him $1. The deaf mute exclaimed, “Is\r\nthis what you are paying me?” To which the employer\r\nresponded, “But you have never said anything.” So\r\nthere are things one has to say. There are things that\r\ncan make someone speak up. The events of 11\r\nSeptember cannot but make us do what we have been\r\ndoing in this Hall this week.\r\nAs this is the first time that my delegation has\r\ntaken part in debate at the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, allow me to convey my delegation’s\r\ngreetings to President Han Seung-soo, and\r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of this\r\nsession and the excellent way in which he is presiding\r\nover our work; to Mr. Harri Holkeri, on his impeccable\r\nwork as President of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nAssembly; and to Mr. Kofi Annan, on his well-\r\ndeserved re-election and his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, which has elicited everyone’s praise.\r\nJudging from the number of speakers who have\r\nspoken before me from this podium — among whom I\r\nshould mention in particular Mayor Rudolph Giuliani\r\nof New York, who honoured us with his presence on\r\n1 October — I would say that on agenda item 166,\r\nentitled “Measures to eliminate international\r\nterrorism”, much has been said and much remains to be\r\nsaid and done; for we, human beings, are the ones with\r\nthe potential to eradicate terrorism, as we are the ones\r\nwho have produced this virus.\r\nTerrorism is not a natural disaster; it is the result\r\nof the minds of certain people who, besides lacking\r\nself-esteem, have no future because they lack\r\nprinciples.\r\nThe unthinkable terrorist acts of 11 September\r\ntook place a few days before the United Nations special\r\nsession devoted to children was due to begin. It had\r\nbeen scheduled to be held in New York from 19 to 21\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\nEquatorial Guinea supports and endorses without\r\nreservation the sound and sensible proposals and\r\nrecommendations that have been made by the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and from this very\r\nrostrum — I am referring here to Security Council\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) and General\r\nAssembly resolution 56/1, as well as to previous\r\nrelevant resolutions — to help us advance on the long,\r\narduous and winding path that is the combat against\r\ninternational terrorism, with the goal of its full\r\neradication.\r\nIn my country, we say that it is good to find and\r\nbring to justice the perpetrator of a crime, but it is\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\nmuch better to resolve the problem that he has caused.\r\nIndeed, the authorities of my country spoke along these\r\nlines following the sad and horrendous events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\nOn 12 September, the President of the Republic,\r\nMr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who happened to be in\r\nthe United States at that time, sent a message of\r\ncondolences to Mr. George Bush, President of the\r\nUnited States of America. At the same time, the\r\nGovernment, following an emergency session and\r\nthrough an official declaration, condemned the terrorist\r\nattacks as well as terrorism in general. Subsequently it\r\nreaffirmed the Republic of Equatorial Guinea’s total\r\nsupport for, and solidarity with, the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States in these days of\r\nsadness and grief.\r\nThe Government declared three days of national\r\nmourning in memory of the victims of the tragedy,\r\nwhich, it noted, affected not only the United States but\r\nall human societies that have aspirations for the future\r\nbased on peace, freedom, justice and democracy. Who,\r\nin one way or another, has not been affected by the\r\ndestruction and the disappearance of the World Trade\r\nCenter — not to mention by the other attacks? The\r\nGovernment put our law enforcement and security\r\nforces on high alert in order to ensure vigilance and to\r\nprotect all United States nationals and interests in the\r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea.\r\nThis conflict is not one that pits the West against\r\nIslam nor some nations against others because of their\r\nfaith. Terrorism is the enemy of all peoples and of all\r\ncivilizations of the world, and therefore it deserves\r\nuniversal condemnation and the adoption of individual\r\nand collective measures to dismantle its entire\r\nfinancing mechanism as well as support of any kind for\r\nterrorist operations. As a result, we urgently need\r\ncloser coordination and cooperation at the international\r\nlevel, which would consider, among other things, the\r\nnecessary exchange of information to prevent and\r\nprotect ourselves against these terrorist acts.\r\nEquatorial Guinea understands that the United\r\nNations must hold consultations at the highest level in\r\norder to set up guidelines and to establish a programme\r\nof action to combat terrorism and to ensure its\r\neradication, as well as safeguard the values of freedom\r\nand the dignity of the human person in the face of the\r\nbarbaric, irrational and perverse nature of international\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe House of Representatives of the People of\r\nEquatorial Guinea, when it met at its second session,\r\nspoke out along these lines through an institutional\r\ndeclaration approved on 16 September that condemned\r\nthe terrorist acts of 11 September and expressed\r\nsolidarity with the people of the United States. The\r\nlegislative body of my country has acknowledged the\r\ndanger posed by these terrorist attacks for the stability\r\nof countries and for world peace, and that efforts\r\nshould be deployed to put an end to international\r\nterrorism, strictly abiding by the criteria of justice and\r\nliberty.\r\nThe House of Representatives has also expressed\r\nits complete willingness to support the Government’s\r\npolicies in the fight against international terrorism.\r\nAccordingly, it is prepared to approve any legal orders\r\nsubmitted to it through the proper channels.\r\nAs a corollary to all of these actions and events,\r\nthe President of the Republic — during a solemn\r\necumenical gathering in support of the United States\r\nthat strongly condemned terrorism and which took\r\nplace at Malabo on 29 September, with broad\r\nparticipation on the part of political leaders, religious\r\nrepresentatives, representatives of the diplomatic corps,\r\nof the public and private sectors and of society at\r\nlarge — made the following statement and asked that it\r\nbe directed to the General Assembly during its\r\nconsideration of the item on measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\n“Today all of the State authorities, political\r\ngroups, religious denominations, private-sector\r\norganizations and foreign representatives posted\r\nin our country have joined us in this ecumenical\r\ncelebration, through which we highlight once\r\nagain the resolute support of the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nfor the people and the Government of the United\r\nStates. We express our solidarity with the\r\ninnocent victims of the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember and solemnly reiterate our most firm\r\nand resolute condemnation of terrorism.\r\n“Our personal — and painful — experience\r\nas a result of these tragic events, which have\r\nbecome a universal tragedy, and our proximity to\r\nthem — because we happened to be visiting the\r\nUnited States with an important Government\r\ndelegation at the time — makes it clear that these\r\nattacks, even if perpetrated against the United\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\nStates, are without a doubt a serious and\r\ncollective affront against the values of freedom,\r\npeace, security and stability throughout the world.\r\n“Furthermore, these terrorist attacks\r\nconstitute an unprecedented threat against the\r\nideals and principles that Equatorial Guinea\r\nshares with other peoples on this planet that\r\ndevote their greatest efforts to ensuring dignity\r\nand progress for human beings, who must benefit\r\nfrom the progress of modern science and\r\ntechnology, not become its victims.\r\n“Although the United States has been the\r\nmain target of these terrorist attacks, we must\r\nrecall nonetheless that among its victims were\r\nnationals of more than a third of the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\n“As a result, we have met here not only to\r\nexpress our solidarity with the United States, but\r\nalso to reflect together and to become fully aware\r\nof the fact that, with these terrorist attacks, what\r\nis at stake is freedom and the survival of\r\nhumankind as a whole.\r\n“In this time of veritable upheaval in\r\ninternational peace and security, Equatorial\r\nGuinea is fully aware of the fact that — at the\r\nbeginning of this twenty-first century — for the\r\nworld, for civilization and for our peoples, these\r\nterrorist acts represent the greatest challenge we\r\nhave faced since the end of the two world wars\r\nand the fall of the Berlin Wall. It brings home the\r\nsad reality that if we do not act decisively and in\r\na concerted manner, we will be experiencing the\r\nbeginning of global developments that could lead\r\nthe planet to its own self-destruction.\r\n“As a result, with respect to what was said\r\nby President Bush during his recent speech before\r\nthe United States Congress in which he referred\r\nto the need for a world coalition against\r\nterrorism, I would add that, in the face of\r\nterrorism, either all of the peoples of the world\r\ncome together within the framework of coherent\r\nand concerted action, or we will all inexorably\r\nsuccumb to its sadistic and inhuman plan, which\r\ntakes no account of races or borders.\r\n“From this perspective — as I said when I\r\nreturned from the United States — I am in favour\r\nof a large-scale consultation at the global level\r\nand of a vigorous and exemplary response to\r\nterrorism, with a view to the global and definitive\r\ndefeat of that barbaric phenomenon and to freeing\r\nourselves from its scourge.\r\n“Beginning on the very day of 11\r\nSeptember, Equatorial Guinea, under the\r\nleadership of my Government, has adopted and\r\ncontinues to adopt measures and strategies\r\nrequiring its cooperation and participation in\r\ncontributing to the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity in the long and difficult battle that\r\nmust be engaged to eradicate terrorism from the\r\nworld, within the framework of the relevant\r\nresolutions and mechanisms of the United\r\nNations, the African Union and the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States, as well as\r\nall current international anti-terrorism\r\nconventions.”\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn this context and at the Central African level,\r\nthe President of the Republic, Mr. Obiang Nguema\r\nMbasogo, addressed a message to his counterparts in\r\nthe subregion, in which he said:\r\n“The terrorist attacks of 11 September in\r\nNew York and Washington, D.C., have threatened\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\n“As a result, Central Africa, which is\r\ndevoted to the principles of solidarity, peace and\r\nstability and is concerned by these disturbing\r\nevents, intends to contribute resolutely, through a\r\ncoordinated strategy, to the efforts of the\r\ninternational community in the fight against\r\nterrorism, above and beyond measures undertaken\r\nby each State of the subregion.\r\n“This coordination, which could lead to a\r\ndeclaration on a common Central African\r\nposition, will allow the current Chairman of the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States\r\n(ECCAS) to express his support and that of the\r\nheads of State of the subregion for the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, as well as their devotion to\r\npeace and stability in the subregion and\r\nthroughout the world, in accordance with the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Treaty establishing the\r\nECCAS and with the principles of the African\r\nUnion on terrorism, peace, security and stability,\r\nwhich were reiterated at the summit of heads of\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\nState in Lomé last year and most recently in\r\nLusaka.”\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nIn conclusion, we express the hope that our\r\ndiscussions, especially on this matter, will continue\r\nunder the principle of the force of argument, rather\r\nthan that of the argument of force.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision\r\ntaken by the General Assembly at its 12th plenary\r\nmeeting on 1 October 2001, I call on the observer of\r\nSwitzerland.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French):\r\nAs this is the first time that my country is speaking at\r\nthis session, allow me, Sir, to convey the heartfelt\r\ncongratulations of Switzerland on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. I can assure you of my delegation’s full\r\nsupport throughout this session.\r\nThe attacks in the United States of America on 11\r\nSeptember are a tragedy that transcends human\r\nunderstanding. They are expressions of criminal\r\nviolence of unprecedented horror.\r\nOn behalf of the Swiss Government and of all the\r\npeople of Switzerland, I wish to express to the\r\nAmerican people our most heartfelt sense of solidarity\r\nand friendship in this tragic ordeal. Our thoughts go to\r\nall the victims, their families and friends. We owe\r\nesteem and recognition to all those who have\r\ncommitted themselves so courageously and without the\r\nleast hesitation to the difficult and dangerous rescue\r\noperation.\r\nThis tragedy has profoundly shocked the Swiss\r\npeople. It has intolerably wounded a sister republic\r\nwith which we share fundamental values. The events in\r\nNew York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania affect\r\nus all. Although the scourge of terrorism may seem\r\nelusive, the international community is neither\r\npowerless nor defenceless. However, the effectiveness\r\nof its response depends on our unity and determination,\r\nbecause terrorism can be successfully countered only\r\nthrough considered and collective action.\r\nThis action must be based on law and on the\r\nfundamental principles that govern our democratic\r\nsocieties. Terrorists want to use violence to destroy the\r\nrule of law. We must not fall into the trap that they\r\nhave set for us. With vision and steadfastness, our\r\nsocieties — which are founded on tolerance and\r\nopenness — must commit themselves to the struggle\r\nagainst this scourge. This effort will require all those\r\npresent in this Assembly to join forces. Because of its\r\nuniversal character and its ability to respond to global\r\nchallenges, the United Nations is called upon to be the\r\ndriving force in this campaign — a role that comes\r\nnaturally to it.\r\nIn adopting resolution 1373 (2001), the Security\r\nCouncil has set the general direction of action. The\r\nSwiss Government welcomes that resolution and takes\r\nthis opportunity to express its strong determination to\r\njoin in the shared effort. It is already participating\r\nfully.\r\nSwitzerland has long been concerned with the\r\nfight against international terrorism. It has made action\r\nin this area a priority at both the international and\r\nnational levels. Switzerland is applying the sanctions\r\nthat have been imposed by the Security Council with\r\nthe aim of combating the threat to peace and security\r\nposed by terrorism. In particular, it has fully and\r\nunconditionally implemented and applied resolutions\r\n1267 (1999) and 1333 (2000).\r\nSwitzerland is party to the international\r\ninstruments on this issue that have been agreed within\r\nboth the United Nations and the Council of Europe.\r\nSwitzerland has signed the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism in\r\nJune. Although that Convention has not yet come into\r\neffect, we have started the ratification process with the\r\naim of bringing it into effect as soon as possible. We\r\nalso intend to become party to the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\r\nin the near future.\r\nSwitzerland has also contributed actively to\r\ndiscussions within the United Nations on the drafting\r\nof a comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism. It will participate in all activities concerned\r\nwith future anti-terrorism instruments.\r\nFinally, in addition to the specific multilateral and\r\nregional anti-terrorism instruments to which it is\r\nbound, Switzerland has established a network of\r\nbilateral treaties on mutual assistance in judicial and\r\nextradition matters with the aim of increasing our\r\nability to prevent and suppress all forms of crime,\r\nincluding terrorism.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\nAt the domestic level, we have a range of laws\r\nthat serve actively to suppress terrorism. On 3 July, the\r\nSecretary-General published a report on measures\r\naimed at eradicating international terrorism, which was\r\ncompiled on the basis of information submitted by a\r\nnumber of States. It describes in exhaustive detail the\r\nmeasures that Switzerland has taken, as well as the\r\nlaws and regulations which it has adopted concerning\r\nthe prevention and suppression of acts of international\r\nterrorism.\r\nIt must be emphasized that Switzerland has a law\r\non international mutual assistance in criminal matters\r\nwhich permits it — even in the absence of treaty\r\nagreements — to cooperate with all other States.\r\nMoreover, Switzerland is one of the few States to make\r\nuse of the “immediate transmission of information”. By\r\nthis means, information obtained in investigations\r\nconducted in Switzerland can be transmitted to a\r\nforeign authority and used in investigations conducted\r\nabroad. Finally, Switzerland is able to take very rapid\r\nprovisional measures. For example, it can order the\r\nfreezing of bank accounts as soon as a foreign\r\nauthority requests such cooperation. These measures\r\nare critical when the need arises to block financial\r\ntransactions that benefit terrorist organizations, and\r\nthey help to prevent the abuse of Swiss financial\r\ninstitutions by terrorist groups.\r\nIn this context, please allow me to be absolutely\r\nclear on one last point: Swiss banking secrecy laws\r\nhave never protected and will never protect terrorists or\r\ntheir financial transactions. The banks are bound by\r\ncriminal law — and this, of course, covers terrorism —\r\nto provide full information to the judicial authorities.\r\nSwitzerland provides effective and prompt\r\ninternational cooperation in criminal matters, in\r\nparticular, by blocking the relevant accounts and\r\ndeposits. Moreover, Swiss banks are obliged to report\r\nto the authorities any justifiable suspicions they have\r\nconcerning transactions related to organized crime and\r\nterrorism. There is no banking secrecy when it comes\r\nto the fight against terrorism.\r\nIt is of fundamental importance that we work\r\ntogether with the greatest determination to combat the\r\nscourge of terrorism. Terrorism threatens all of us and\r\ntogether we must make sure that it is defeated. There is\r\nno justification whatsoever for acts such as those\r\ncommitted on 11 September. However, the recourse to\r\nforce alone will not suffice to eliminate terrorism. In\r\nthe long term, there exists no other way to ensure\r\ninternational security and to prevent such despicable\r\nacts than to reinforce international cooperation with a\r\nview to eradicating poverty, preventing and resolving\r\nconflicts and effectively promoting human rights and\r\nthe rule of law. To this end, the international\r\ncommunity must act more decisively than ever.\r\nThe worldwide reaction to the abominable acts to\r\nwhich we were all witness must prompt us to pursue\r\nthe fight against terrorism without respite. We must do\r\nso in memory of the victims. We must do so to preserve\r\nthe primacy of law over force, and for the blossoming\r\nof our democratic societies.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 3369 (XXX), of 10 October 1975,\r\nI now call on the observer for the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference.\r\nMr. Lamani (Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference): I would like at the outset to extend to\r\nyou, Sir, on behalf of the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, our sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. We have full\r\nconfidence that the work of this Assembly will be\r\nsuccessful under your wise leadership.\r\nIn the press statements made by its Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\n(OIC) has condemned the criminal terrorist attacks\r\nperpetrated against the United States on 11 September\r\n2001. They were completely against all human values,\r\ncreeds and religions, prominent among which is Islam,\r\nwhich values the sanctity of human life and holds that\r\nwhoever unjustly kills one soul kills all people. We\r\nmust emphasize here that Islam is innocent of all forms\r\nof terrorism and strongly condemns those who\r\nperpetrated these horrendous crimes in the name of\r\nIslam, regardless of how they attempt to justify their\r\nacts. The OIC has continually denounced all forms of\r\nterrorism in accordance with the moral and human\r\nprinciples in which its member States believe. Those\r\nprinciples have roots in the sublime religions, legacies\r\nand traditions of these States, all of which call for\r\neliminating all forms of injustice, aggression and\r\nintolerance.\r\nTerrorism threatens the life of innocent people\r\nand their property, violates the sovereignty of States\r\nand constitutes a danger for the rights of people. On the\r\nbasis of the international consensus to fight terrorism\r\nin all its forms and to put an end to its causes, the\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\nSecretary-General of the OIC supports the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, which were adopted unanimously, and urges\r\nthe member States of the OIC to continue to work\r\npositively towards the implementation of those\r\nresolutions. The emergency ministerial meeting of the\r\nOIC, to be held in Doha, Qatar, on 10 October, is a\r\nform of support for international efforts to combat\r\nterrorism. In this connection, we established an OIC\r\ntreaty to combat international terrorism, which was\r\nadopted by the Foreign Ministers of OIC member\r\nStates at their twenty-sixth session, in Burkina Faso, in\r\n1999. That treaty calls upon member States, inter alia,\r\nto refrain from providing any form of assistance or\r\nsupport to terrorists, including shelter or financial\r\nsupport.\r\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly\r\nhave issued a number of important resolutions calling\r\nfor an end to the scourge of terrorism. These\r\nresolutions, in addition to the many resolutions adopted\r\nby regional organizations — among which is the\r\norganization I have the honour of representing here —\r\nattempt to establish an international framework under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations. The resolutions\r\ntake a united stance on international terrorism and are\r\nconducive to respect for international laws and the\r\npurposes and principles that all humanity agreed to in\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe all know that there are many problems at the\r\ninternational level. The spread of extremism and\r\nterrorist acts all over the world have underscored the\r\nfact that all forms of terrorism are one and the same\r\nand therefore should not be tolerated. We have to\r\nemphasize here that extremism, violence and terrorism\r\nare international phenomena; they are not limited to a\r\nspecific people, race or religion. The international\r\ncommunity is one community, based on\r\nmulticulturalism, multiple religions and multiple\r\nideologies. This pluralism should not undermine the\r\nunity of the international community. International\r\nrelations should be based on the positive coexistence of\r\nStates and on a joint appreciation of the different\r\ncontributions and achievements of different societies.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, some have spoken\r\nabout conflict between civilizations. Some are still\r\ntalking about that idea. The issue is one of significance\r\nfor the whole of humanity and its future. Convinced of\r\nthe importance of a dialogue among civilizations,\r\nIslamic countries were the first to present a draft\r\nresolution on the subject to the Assembly.\r\nIn condemning terrorism, we should also\r\ncondemn any attempt to blur the distinction between\r\nterrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples under\r\ncolonial rule or foreign occupation. The struggle of\r\nsuch people to achieve national liberation and self-\r\ndetermination, in accordance with the principles of\r\ninternational law and the provisions of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, does not constitute terrorism. In\r\nthis context, we reaffirm our support for the holding of\r\nan international conference, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, to define terrorism; to distinguish\r\nbetween terrorism and the rights of people to resist\r\nforeign occupation and achieve national liberation; and\r\nto take all measures to eradicate terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations.\r\nAs members of the international community, we\r\nmust continue with this effort against terrorism and\r\nensure that we do not approach this very dangerous\r\nphenomenon with double standards. We should\r\ncontinue our worthwhile attempt to support the\r\ndialogue between civilizations. We should be\r\nresponsible enough to face up to any attempt to create\r\ndiscord, disunity and hatred between peoples. We\r\nshould all support coexistence and cooperation between\r\ndifferent peoples and cultures as a basis of that\r\ndialogue.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/265 of 24 August 1994, I now\r\ncall on the Observer for the Sovereign Military Order\r\nof Malta.\r\nMr. Linati-Bosch (Sovereign Military Order of\r\nMalta): I would first like to congratulate you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on behalf of the Sovereign Military Order of\r\nMalta, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly during its fifty-sixth session. I am sure that\r\nyour excellent qualifications and strong commitment\r\nwill ensure the efficacy of our work at such a difficult\r\ntime.\r\nThe Order of Malta condemns terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations. We felt as though we were living in a\r\nnightmare when, on the morning of 11 September, New\r\nYork and Washington became the victims of criminal\r\nacts. It is true that, after 11 September, no one feels\r\nsafe from terrorism. However, I would like to condemn\r\nnot only the attack of 11 September, but all the\r\nmanifestations of terrorism, violence and intolerance\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\nthat convulse our world. International terrorism defies\r\ninternational security, and, in consequence, the\r\ninternational community has the right to defend itself\r\nin accordance with international public law.\r\nWe cannot consider what happened in New York\r\nand Washington as isolated incidents. The excellent\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization, and his report on measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism, mentioned many geographical\r\nareas where peace and human rights are violated, and\r\nthere is no need for me to list them all again. Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1368 (2001) reaffirmed the right to\r\ncollective self-defence. That resolution, adopted on 12\r\nSeptember, and the General Assembly resolution\r\nadopted on the same day, constitute the starting point\r\nfor the prevention and suppression of terrorist\r\nactivities, wherever they appear. Effective measures\r\nmust be adopted if we are not to succumb to terror,\r\nintolerance, fanaticism and fear but, on the contrary, to\r\nbuild a stable system of morals and civic honour.\r\nWe hear the word “globalization” every day. We\r\nmust be aware that terrorism signifies the globalization\r\nof fear and contempt for international law,\r\nhumanitarian law and the law of conventions. This is a\r\ntransgression that cannot remain without an adequate\r\nresponse, and it involves the responsibility of all of us.\r\nWe know that sovereignty signifies independence\r\nfrom any other subject of international law and, in\r\nconsequence, we must consider that it is the duty of\r\nevery country to fight terrorism in its own territory\r\nand, at the same time, to participate in international\r\naction against international terrorism. Let there be no\r\nmore sanctuaries for terrorists.\r\nOne activity of the Order of Malta is especially\r\ndisrupted by terrorism. I am referring to its\r\nhumanitarian activity and to the difficulties that its\r\nhumanitarian personnel face in the accomplishment of\r\ntheir mission when taking part in peacekeeping\r\noperations — difficulties that, on some occasions,\r\nhinder their presence even when this presence is\r\nrequested by national Governments or international\r\nentities. We are in favour of the protection of civilians\r\nin armed conflicts, but it must be acknowledged that\r\nduly accredited humanitarian personnel also merit\r\neffective protection when their presence has been\r\nrequested or authorized.\r\nThe United Nations is the best representation of\r\nthe international community, and as such it is the\r\nresponsibility of the Organization, working together\r\nwith States, regional organizations, communities, other\r\nentities and even individuals, to lead the fight against\r\nall transnational crime. In this regard, the Sovereign\r\nMilitary Order of Malta expresses its commitment to\r\ncollaborate and to share responsibility in the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on agenda item 166.\r\nWe have had an unusually long, but important and\r\nconstructive, debate during the past five days. It was\r\nunprecedented in the history of the United Nations for\r\n167 Member States and 4 observers to participate in a\r\ndebate on a single agenda item. This fact alone\r\neloquently demonstrates how seriously all Member\r\nStates, and the whole international community, regard\r\nthe acts of terrorism that took place on 11 September.\r\nWe did so because we all believed that they were not\r\nonly attacks on the United States, but assaults on the\r\nwhole civilized world.\r\nAs we all know, the agenda item 166, entitled\r\n“Measures to eliminate international terrorism” has\r\nlong been on the agenda of the Sixth Committee.\r\nHowever, in the light of the importance and urgency of\r\nthe issue in the aftermath of the tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember, we decided that the debate on this item\r\nshould be held in plenary meeting while consideration\r\nof the technical aspects of the item remain within the\r\npurview of the Sixth Committee.\r\nBefore our debate began, we had an invaluable\r\nopportunity to listen to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of\r\nNew York, our host city, who gave us a very clear\r\nperspective on the terrorist attacks and conveyed the\r\nexpectations that United States citizens, particularly the\r\ncitizens of New York, have of the United Nations at\r\nthis critical time. I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto thank Mayor Giuliani once again and offer our very\r\nbest wishes for our host city’s speedy recovery.\r\nDuring our deliberations, all participants joined\r\nwholeheartedly in condemning the terrorist attacks of\r\n11 September, reaffirming resolution 56/1 of 12\r\nSeptember 2001, in which the General Assembly\r\ncondemned these attacks in the strongest terms and\r\ncalled for international cooperation to bring to justice\r\nthe perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of the\r\noutrages.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.22\r\nMember States voiced the view that international\r\nterrorism constitutes a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity, as well as a crime against humanity.\r\nUndoubtedly, international terrorism is one of the\r\nformidable challenges to the world community in the\r\ntwenty-first century, and the United Nations should\r\nplay the key role in intensifying international efforts to\r\neliminate such terrorism.\r\nIn this regard, I wish to recall that the General\r\nAssembly has taken important steps, by adopting in\r\n1994 the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate\r\nInternational Terrorism and by adopting its\r\nsupplementary Declaration in 1996. The Security\r\nCouncil has also taken initiatives, such as the adoption\r\nof resolutions 1269 (1999) of 19 October 1999, 1368\r\n(2001) of 12 September 2001 and 1373 (2001) of 28\r\nSeptember 2001, which not only condemned all forms\r\nof terrorism but also specified measures to be taken by\r\nMember States to prevent and suppress terrorist acts.\r\nMember States recognized the urgency of dealing\r\nwith all forms and manifestations of international\r\nterrorism and those who harbour and support the\r\nperpetrators, organizers and sponsors of international\r\nterrorism. They stressed the need to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation and to promptly take all\r\nnecessary measures to prevent and suppress terrorist\r\nactivities.\r\nMember States concurred in the view that a\r\nprimary task facing the international community at\r\npresent is to ensure that an effective legal framework\r\nfor the prevention and elimination of international\r\nterrorism is in place. To this end, I call upon all\r\nMember States that have not yet done so to become, as\r\na matter of priority, parties to the existing international\r\nconventions relating to terrorism. In this context, it is\r\nnoteworthy that the Commission on Crime Prevention\r\nand Criminal Justice recently adopted the revised draft\r\naction plan for the implementation of the Vienna\r\nDeclaration on Crime and Justice. Many Member\r\nStates also expressed their intention to take necessary\r\nmeasures to implement international conventions\r\nwithin their domestic jurisdiction.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to urge\r\nMember States to accelerate the work of the General\r\nAssembly, with a view to the early conclusion of the\r\npending conventions on international terrorism, in\r\norder to enhance the capacity of the international\r\ncommunity to combat terrorism. As President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I also kindly request the Sixth\r\nCommittee to expedite its work and submit its report to\r\nthe General Assembly as early as possible, preferably\r\nby 15 November 2001.\r\nFinally, I recall that during our debate Member\r\nStates shared the view that the international community\r\nshould resolve to fight terrorism as a phenomenon\r\nseparate from any religion or ethnic group. In this\r\nregard, the necessity for dialogue among civilizations\r\nwas stressed. Also, some representatives suggested a\r\nhigh-level conference on international terrorism, while\r\nsome others called upon the international community to\r\naddress the root causes of terrorism. At the same time,\r\nthe need for a clearer definition of terrorism was raised\r\nfor our further consideration.\r\nOur week-long deliberation was instrumental in\r\nreaffirming the central role of the United Nations in\r\ndealing with global, high-profile issues such as\r\ninternational terrorism. It is my sincere hope that the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community will\r\ntake further necessary measures to combat international\r\nterrorism, building on the deliberations we have had\r\nfor the last five days.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 166.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.10 p.m.\r\n"
