"United Nations A/56/PV.26\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nFifty-sixth session\r\n26th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 15 October 2001, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-178. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n01-57959 (E)\r\n*0157959*\r\nPresident: Mr. Han Seung-soo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Republic of Korea)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Sharma\r\n(Nepal), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/56/2)\r\nMr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus would like to\r\njoin previous speakers in thanking the Ambassador of\r\nIreland for having presented the periodic report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe arguments made in the report deserve serious\r\nstudy and analysis, because they touch on the most topical\r\nissues of the functioning of one of the most important\r\nbodies of the United Nations, the one responsible for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe dispassionate statistical data contained in the\r\nreport confirm that last year the Security Council\r\nworked actively to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity. This is convincingly borne out by the\r\nsignificant growth in the number of official\r\nmeetings — which went up from 144 during the\r\nprevious period under review to 173 — and by the\r\nincrease in the number of working documents of\r\nvarious kinds that were examined and prepared by the\r\nmembers of the Council. It is very important that the\r\nCouncil focused its attention on the truly vital issues of\r\nsettling conflicts in Africa and in the Balkans, the\r\nproblems of peacekeeping in East Timor, a multifaceted\r\nexamination of the peacekeeping operations system,\r\nsanctions activities and other issues. A number of steps\r\nundertaken by the Council helped bring about\r\nconsiderable progress and important decisions in various\r\nareas.\r\nIn this regard, we believe that it is necessary to\r\nnote the great improvements in the system of\r\npeacekeeping operations. Without a doubt, a key role\r\nwas played by the recommendations in the report by\r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, which were presented to us\r\nbefore the Millennium Summit, and also by the\r\nactivities of the Working Group of the Whole on\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, which was\r\nestablished by the Security Council on 31 January\r\n2001. Belarus welcomes the initiative of Singapore to\r\nhold, on 16 January 2001, a large-scale, open\r\ndiscussion in the Council on strengthening cooperation\r\nwith troop-contributing countries. We are convinced\r\nthat resolution 1353 (2001) opens up new possibilities\r\nfor positive change in this area, which is a key link in\r\nthe process of improving peacekeeping operations\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus, which signed, on 1\r\nOctober 2001, a memorandum of understanding with\r\nthe Secretariat on participation in the system of standby\r\npeacekeeping arrangements, attaches particular\r\nimportance to these discussions on this question in the\r\nframework of the Council.\r\nI would like to point out the positive role played\r\nby the Council in efforts to normalize the situation in\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nthe Great Lakes region in Africa. It is absolutely\r\nobvious that the progress that we are witnessing in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi and in\r\nborder areas between Ethiopia and Eritrea would have\r\nall been impossible without the leading role of the\r\nSecurity Council. In this regard, I would like to note\r\nwith satisfaction the increased interaction between the\r\nCouncil and regional organizations. The joint meeting\r\nbetween the Council and the representatives of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nand the plans to hold a similar joint meeting on Burundi,\r\nin our view, show the need for and usefulness of such\r\ncontacts. We believe that active efforts should be made\r\nto continue holding such meetings.\r\nIt is also important to note the efforts that the\r\nCouncil has made in the period under review to interact\r\nwith other bodies of the United Nations. We are\r\nconvinced that careful analysis of the still untapped\r\npotential in this area is very much needed. It is\r\nabsolutely clear that the concept of conflict prevention\r\nand the full implementation of the strategy of resolving\r\nvarious crisis situations are connected with many\r\neconomic and social issues. Therefore, we need to tap\r\nthe potential of other bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem. In this regard, the United Kingdom initiative\r\non holding a joint meeting between the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council that\r\ntakes into consideration the ideas and proposals of\r\nthese bodies, in the opinion of Belarus, can and must\r\nbe acted upon.\r\nAgainst background of the great progress that the\r\nCouncil has made in the process of considering the\r\nquestion of peacekeeping operations, the activities of\r\nthe Working Group on General Issues of Sanctions also\r\ncontinues to be a focus of attention of the Member\r\nStates of the United Nations. We realize that parts IV\r\nand V of the report cannot fully reflect the important\r\ndynamic of considering the sanctions question in the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAfter the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the\r\nquestion of sanctions is becoming one of the highest\r\npriorities in the activities of the Security Council. It is\r\nclear that under present conditions, this question\r\nshould be given paramount importance. Belarus\r\nconsiders that expert assessments by specialized\r\ninternational agencies and a more careful use of the\r\nWassenaar Arrangement can play an important role in\r\nthis regard. Belarus welcomes the recent resolutions of\r\nthe Council on the lifting of sanctions against the\r\nSudan and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We\r\nthink that the decisive steps undertaken by the Council\r\ncan be seen as important and constructive contributions\r\ntowards creating a comprehensive basis for combating\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nThe report reflects the efforts deployed by the\r\nCouncil in the settlement of the Middle East conflict\r\nfollowing the Al-Aqsa intifada in 2000. Belarus\r\nwelcome the efforts made by the Council to put an end\r\nto the violence and civilian casualties in the region. At\r\nthe same time, we regret that the most decisive of steps\r\nhave not been taken in order to find a comprehensive\r\nsolution in order to settle the crisis and begin\r\nnegotiations towards the full implementation of earlier\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and the recommendations\r\nof the special Committee of George Mitchell.\r\nWe continue to be concerned over the situation in\r\nthe Balkans. The Security Council report shows that\r\nthe activities of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo have always been at\r\nthe centre of the Council’s attention. We are convinced\r\nthat on the eve of elections in the province, the Council\r\ncan and must do its utmost to ensure that the vote is\r\ntruly universal and can be a starting point for the full\r\nsettlement of the situation in Kosovo in accordance\r\nwith resolution 1244 (1999).\r\nBelarus also welcomes the steps undertaken by\r\nthe Council to stabilize the situation in Macedonia.\r\nFurther careful monitoring of the issues in the Balkans\r\nand balanced decisions on the part of the United\r\nNations body having primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security will\r\nbe, in our view, a guarantee of peace in that region, and\r\nindeed of Europe as a whole.\r\nCareful analysis of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil submitted this session once again confirms the\r\nneed for improvements in its form and content. This\r\nwas already stated by representatives of many\r\ndelegations. It is obvious that this document is too\r\nvoluminous. Moreover, it is basically a technical\r\ncompilation of resolutions, decisions and others\r\ndocuments that have been discussed and adopted by the\r\nCouncil during the year.\r\nAt a time when the Council is constantly\r\nimproving the methods of its work, retaining the status\r\nquo of the format of the report cannot help the General\r\nAssembly fully and adequately evaluate the work that\r\nis carried out by the Council. In our view, a positive\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nexample in this regard could be the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization,\r\nwhich does not simply state, but also analyses the\r\nactivities of the United Nations. We are convinced that\r\nadditional study and consideration of the opinions of\r\nthe Member States in this area will improve the report.\r\nThe events of this September in the United States\r\nof America once again show the importance of the\r\nauthority conferred on the Council under the Charter to\r\nmaintain peace and security. The threat of global\r\nterrorism means new challenges to humankind,\r\nrequiring a new consolidation and concentration of\r\nefforts and the search for new, and sometimes\r\nunorthodox solutions. From this rostrum, I would like\r\nto underscore that the President and the Government of\r\nBelarus unequivocally support resolution 1373 (2001)\r\nof the Security Council, which is aimed at creating an\r\neffective, comprehensive mechanism to combat\r\nterrorism. We in Belarus are currently working on a\r\nnumber of measures to implement the provisions of this\r\nresolution at the national level.\r\nFighting terrorism brings together the members of\r\nthe Security Council and all the members of the United\r\nNations. We stand ready to contribute towards that\r\nunity, now and in the future.\r\nMy delegation would also like to congratulate the\r\nnew members of the Council — Bulgaria, Cameroon,\r\nGuinea, Mexico and the Syrian Arab Republic. We\r\nwish them every success.\r\nMr. Heinbecker (Canada): We speak today on\r\nthe report of the Security Council this year as a\r\ndelegation that was a member of the Security Council\r\nfor half of the time in question. This explains why we\r\nunderstand that some practices of the Security Council\r\nhave to be the way they are. It also explains why we\r\nunderstand that some things can, and should, change.\r\nIn particular, we think there are three ways in which\r\nrelatively small changes in Council practice could reap\r\nsignificant benefits in Council performance:\r\ncooperation with troop-contributing countries,\r\ntransparency and accountability.\r\nOne way to improve the effectiveness of Council\r\ndecision-making is to ensure that there is genuine\r\ncooperation with those members most affected by\r\nCouncil decisions on peacekeeping, that is, the troop-\r\ncontributing countries. An encouraging start has been\r\nmade, and we welcome the establishment of the\r\nWorking Group on peacekeeping operations, under the\r\nchairmanship of Ambassador Ward. We wish to work\r\nwith the Council and with that Group, and to go\r\nbeyond consultations to genuine cooperation. Such\r\ncooperation, if properly executed, would not only\r\nnarrow the accountability gap between those who make\r\nthe decisions to deploy peacekeeping missions and those\r\nwho supply the troops, but it would also ensure that the\r\nCouncil had the best possible information at its disposal\r\nfrom countries that had their forces in the field.\r\nFurthermore, it would give the Council access to\r\nthe perspectives and the ideas of the troop-contributing\r\ncountries. Present practice does not allow the Council\r\nand major troop-contributing countries to engage\r\nconstructively enough on specific peacekeeping\r\nmissions, and it does not afford troop-contributing\r\nGovernments the control and influence their national\r\nParliaments believe them to have when they agree to\r\ndeploy forces in contemporary complex and dangerous\r\nmissions. Current meetings, with their consultative\r\norientation, are inevitably perfunctory, because they are\r\nstructurally incapable of producing satisfactory results.\r\nThe Security Council Working Group on\r\npeacekeeping operations has the opportunity to correct\r\nthis practice, which was developed in less demanding\r\ntimes for less dangerous missions. We are therefore\r\nhopeful that the views of many troop contributors — as\r\ncontributed to the Council over the past several\r\nmonths, including in the letter that is being signed\r\ntoday by the Permanent Representatives of troop-\r\ncontributing countries — will be taken to heart by the\r\nWorking Group. Mission-specific core groups made up\r\nof Security Council members and major troop-\r\ncontributing countries for particular missions would\r\nmanage operations cooperatively, not just engage in\r\nelective consultations by the grace of the Council or at\r\nthe initiative of an individual member of the Council.\r\nThat would go a long way to ensuring that the Council’s\r\ndecisions were sound for each specific mission.\r\nOur second point is on transparency and\r\nengagement between Security Council members and\r\nnon-Security Council members. Transparency has been\r\na term of art applied to the more frequent recourse to\r\nopen meetings that we have seen in the past couple of\r\nyears. It is an outcome that we worked for when we\r\nwere on the Council, and one that we welcome.\r\nHolding public meetings of the Security Council\r\npermits all Member States to have access to the\r\nbriefing information provided by the Secretariat. It also\r\nallows Member States to hear how the Council is\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\ntreating issues that are on its agenda, and it can at times\r\npermit input from non-Council-member States into the\r\ndecision-making processes of the Council.\r\nAt the same time, the Council needs to guard\r\nagainst the temptation to hold public meetings that\r\nhave more to do with theatre than with policy. Holding\r\npublic meetings after decisions have been made on a\r\ntopic and resolutions or presidential statements have\r\nbeen drafted induces cynicism rather than engagement,\r\nand indifference rather than cooperation. The Council\r\nhas numerous meeting formats at its disposal, from in\r\ncamera meetings through those to which select\r\nmembers of the membership are invited to public\r\nmeetings. All of these formats should be utilized, even\r\nat the cost of convenience.\r\nEffective decision-making in a global organization\r\nrequires that accountability trump convenience.\r\nTechniques also matter. One of the most important of\r\nthese, in our view, and the one on which, regrettably,\r\nwe have had the least success as an Organization, was\r\nthe attempt by the Council last year, led by the United\r\nKingdom, to engage in a more interactive discussion.\r\nGood decision-making is hampered, not facilitated, by\r\nnon-Council delegations reading out lengthy, repetitive\r\nstatements, and by Council members sometimes\r\nstruggling, and sometimes not, to listen to those\r\nstatements. The practice is inefficient, it is ineffective\r\nand, worst, it is self-defeating. Delegations should,\r\nideally, intervene to ask questions or to communicate\r\nideas on how, corporately, the Council or the\r\nOrganization might handle an issue differently or\r\nbetter. Except for the delegations whose countries are\r\nthe objects of the exercise, there is rarely a need to put\r\nnational positions on the record. Where such a need is\r\nfelt, it would suffice to circulate written texts.\r\nI turn to accountability. Our third point is that,\r\nhowever compelling a rationale for a veto is, it remains\r\ntrue that much of the dissatisfaction of the general\r\nmembership with the Council arises from the use or the\r\nthreat of the use of the veto. As previous debates in the\r\nGeneral Assembly on Security Council reform have\r\ndemonstrated unequivocally, an overwhelming number\r\nof delegations continue to call for some curtailment of\r\nthe veto. Permanent members that expect the general\r\nmembership to respect Council decisions need to\r\nrespond to this dissatisfaction.\r\nWe are not suggesting that those who hold the\r\nveto renounce it. But we are suggesting that a\r\nvoluntary code of conduct on the use of the veto, as\r\nproposed by one member of the permanent five two\r\nyears ago, would be a good reform. From Bosnia to\r\nSomalia to Rwanda to Kosovo — to name only a few\r\ninstances — the veto or the threat of a veto has played\r\na role in the Council’s making poor decisions. Such a\r\ncode of conduct could make clear to the membership\r\nunder what circumstances veto-holding members consider\r\nthe use of the veto legitimate. It would introduce\r\naccountability to an instrument whose use, unfortunately,\r\nhas too often been guided by concerns other than the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAs part of a voluntary code of conduct,\r\npermanent members could agree, for example, to meet\r\nwith the broader membership to explain why they felt\r\nthey had to use the veto or to threaten its use. Such a\r\nstep would go a long way to improving the political\r\naccountability of Security Council decision-making.\r\nFinancial accountability is also important. Who is\r\nmonitoring the Council from the perspective of\r\nfinancial responsibility? The General Assembly does\r\nhold a power of the purse. Greater recourse to that\r\npower to ensure that money is well spent is an idea\r\nwhose time may well be coming.\r\nAnother area ripe for better accountability is the\r\nformat of Security Council meetings. We should begin\r\nby stopping the practice of pretending that informal in\r\ncamera meetings do not effectively exist. Nobody\r\nbelieves that so-called informal meetings are either\r\ninformal, or mere consultations. But this accepted\r\ndouble-speak has detrimental affects for accountability.\r\nDepicting these gatherings as “non-meetings” of the\r\nCouncil greatly understates their importance. It also\r\nputs records of the meeting beyond Members’ reach and,\r\nover time, beyond the reach of historians and others who\r\nmay wish to analyse why the United Nations acted in a\r\ncertain way at a certain time in history.\r\nAccountability on this issue is a matter of concern\r\nto the General Assembly, not simply because the\r\ngeneral membership pays for informal consultations of\r\nthe Security Council — for the extensive support unit\r\nwithin the Department of Political Affairs, for\r\nconference services and for the salaries of the many\r\nSecretariat staff who brief “non-meetings” on a regular\r\nbasis. It is also a matter of concern because Council\r\nbusiness is everyone’s business, and because we are all\r\naffected by the outcome.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nThe obligations of the Security Council to the\r\ngeneral membership as enshrined in the Charter —\r\nespecially concerning the procedures for their\r\nparticipation in Council discussions — continue to be\r\nbreached by placing what look, feel like and smell like\r\nmeetings of the Security Council beyond the reach of\r\nthe membership and, indeed, of the Charter.\r\nWe do not dispute the need for the Council to\r\nmeet behind closed doors when the situation warrants,\r\nas it very often does. But the practice of clothing such\r\nregular and important in camera meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council in obscurity — with no records being\r\nmade available to the membership — does us all a\r\ndisservice.\r\nThe events of the last month, during which the\r\nCouncil was both effective and efficient in responding\r\nto terrorism, illustrate that those many hours spent in\r\nthe back room — far from being non-existent —\r\ndeserve serious and mature treatment, including record\r\nkeeping. We ask, therefore, that the informal\r\nconsultations be treated as what they are: private\r\nmeetings of the Security Council to which the Charter\r\nand Council rules of procedure should apply.\r\nFinally, we, like others, find the report of the\r\nSecurity Council — this compendium of documents —\r\nto be long and of only chequered benefit. Much of the\r\ninformation in that report is already available on the\r\nWeb site and, in this age of computer and Web\r\nsophistication, we could dispense with a good deal of\r\nwhat is in the report.\r\nIn summary, the events of the past five weeks\r\nhave demonstrated that the Security Council can\r\nrespond well to threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Our job — the Council’s job and the\r\nAssembly’s job — is to continue to work to develop\r\nbetter means of cooperation, better habits of\r\ntransparency and better processes of accountability to\r\nmake the Council the fully effective organ that the\r\ndangerous world we now live in demands.\r\nMr. Manalo (Philippines): I should like at the\r\noutset to thank the Permanent Representative of\r\nIreland, Ambassador Richard Ryan, for introducing this\r\nyear’s report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter mandates\r\nthe Security Council to submit annual reports to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, while Article 15 mandates the\r\nGeneral Assembly to consider these reports. Thus, as\r\nthe only United Nations organ which receives an\r\nannual report from the Council, we believe that the\r\nGeneral Assembly should view this mandate not only\r\nas an opportunity for exchanging views on the matters\r\nthe Council is seized of, but also as a means for\r\nconveying to the Council the Assembly’s views on the\r\nCouncil’s work and decisions.\r\nAt this and previous sessions, delegations have\r\ncommented upon certain aspects of the format, content\r\nand presentation of the Council’s report and, in this\r\nregard, have suggested improvements. We hope these\r\nsuggestions will continue to be taken into account by\r\nthe Council with a view to improving the presentation\r\nof the report.\r\nGiven the large number of issues and activities\r\ncovered in the Council’s report, I wish to confine my\r\nstatement to just some of them.\r\nOf the many country and regional situations of\r\nwhich the Council was seized during the period\r\ncovered by the report, my delegation wishes to\r\nhighlight that of East Timor. In this regard, the\r\nCouncil’s efforts must be commended. To date, the\r\nsuccessful recent elections have certainly been the high\r\npoint of the United Nations Transitional Administration\r\nin East Timor, which is in many respects a historic and\r\nnation-building mission. Full independence will be the\r\nnext step. Nevertheless, an appropriate international\r\npresence and level of assistance will be needed after\r\nindependence. The size, composition and nature of the\r\npresence should also be determined in consultation\r\nwith the East Timorese people. In the final analysis, the\r\nfuture of East Timor lies in the hands of its people.\r\nWe also feel that the Council should play a role in\r\nhelping to defuse tensions in the Middle East. At the\r\nsame time, it is clearly recognized that terrorism is a\r\nthreat to international peace and security. We have no\r\ndoubt that the Security Council, particularly through its\r\nCommittee created by resolution 1373 (2001), will\r\nmonitor this issue in a sustained and vigorous fashion.\r\nWe hope that the Council will stay in close touch with\r\nMember States with respect to implementing Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), as well as on other matters\r\nconnected with our fight against terrorism.\r\nSome of the country situations discussed in the\r\nreport also touch upon or allude to a number of related\r\nissues with regard to which my delegation believes\r\nmore interactive consideration among the Council, the\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nGeneral Assembly and Member States could prove\r\nuseful. These include issues such as sanctions,\r\nconsultations with troop-contributing countries and\r\nconflict prevention.\r\nRegarding sanctions, experience has shown that\r\nthey have inflicted a heavy toll on civilian populations\r\nand third parties. The Council’s efforts to develop the\r\nconcept of targeted sanctions, where pressure is\r\nfocused on those responsible rather than on the\r\ninnocent, is therefore a positive response in this regard.\r\nResolutions such as 1343 (2001), which imposed a\r\ntravel ban and an embargo on diamonds, is a concrete\r\nexample of this response.\r\nGiven the importance of further work on this\r\nissue, we believe that the general membership would\r\nfind it helpful if the report were to include, perhaps as\r\nan appendix, the summary records of the meetings of\r\nthe Council’s sanctions Committees, without prejudice\r\nto the confidentiality of the work of those Committees.\r\nAn issue inherent to the various peacekeeping\r\noperations discussed in the report — one that is\r\ndiscussed in some of the monthly assessments of the\r\nPresidents of the Council — is that of consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing countries. We wish, in\r\nparticular, to cite the monthly assessment of\r\nSingapore’s presidency, which summarizes the key\r\nissues raised by troop-contributing countries during an\r\nopen debate of the Council on that issue. In our opinion,\r\nthose views clearly point to the need for triangular\r\nconsultations and the institutionalization of those\r\nconsultations during all stages of deliberations on a\r\npeacekeeping operation. We therefore urge the Council\r\nto continue addressing these concerns. The adoption of\r\nresolution 1353 (2001) is an important step forward.\r\nWe nevertheless look forward to further substantive\r\nimprovements which take into account the outstanding\r\nproposals of the troop-contributing countries.\r\nThe prevention of armed conflict is an issue\r\nraised in the report on which interaction between the\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and Member States will\r\nbe needed, especially with regard to the structural\r\nprevention of armed conflict, which entails dealing\r\nwith the root causes of conflict. A number of the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations on the\r\nprevention of armed conflict could provide useful input\r\nfor such interaction.\r\nThe report of the Security Council also touches\r\nupon the Council’s work on documentation and\r\nworking methods. As we are all aware, this subject is\r\nalso being dealt with in the General Assembly Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council reform.\r\nHence, if information could be provided in future\r\nreports of the Council not only on the measures\r\nadopted by the Security Council in this area, but also\r\non the reforms being considered by the Council’s\r\nWorking Group on Documentation and Procedures, the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s Working Group’s work and\r\ndeliberations would be greatly enhanced.\r\nIn the monthly assessment by the presidency of\r\nBangladesh a number of issues were suggested for\r\nconsideration by the Security Council’s Working Group\r\non Documentation and Procedures. It would be helpful\r\nto know the results of such consideration. We also\r\nsupport the recommendation of the Bangladesh\r\npresidency that the Council’s Working Group consider\r\nthe report of the General Assembly’s Working Group\r\non Council reform, especially on suggestions to\r\nimprove the working methods of the Council. In the\r\nsame vein, there is a need for the Security Council to\r\nmaintain and, where appropriate, improve upon the\r\nmeasures it has already implemented to promote\r\ngreater transparency of its work, such as those cited in\r\nthe monthly assessment report of the United Kingdom\r\npresidency. My delegation also supports more dialogue\r\nbetween the Council’s representatives and the General\r\nAssembly Open-ended Working Group on the working\r\nmethods and procedures of the Council, using the\r\nformat employed earlier this year in an Open-ended\r\nWorking Group meeting.\r\nThe thematic debates of the Council mentioned in\r\nthe report were very useful and should be continued.\r\nNevertheless, we believe they should be more than\r\ndebates. They should also aim at action-oriented\r\nobjectives over a medium-term period. Thematic\r\ndebates of the Council could also be synchronized with\r\ndebates on the same issues in the General Assembly for\r\nthe purpose of linking decisions or appropriate policy\r\naction by the Council and the General Assembly on\r\nthese issues. One issue that comes to mind is the\r\nprevention of armed conflict.\r\nI have referred to the monthly assessments of the\r\nPresidents of the Council because they serve as a good\r\nbasis for analysing the Council’s report. We therefore\r\nhope that the section on presidential assessments can\r\nbe allotted greater prominence in future reports,\r\nperhaps as a separate chapter in the main body of the\r\nreport. At the same time, it would be more than helpful\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nif the Presidents’ assessments were to refer to the\r\nhighlights of the informal consultations of the whole on\r\nsome of the key issues considered during their\r\nrespective presidencies. Assessments of Security Council\r\nmissions, where relevant, would also be useful.\r\nWe look forward in the coming years to\r\nsubstantive consideration of the report of the Council,\r\nnot necessarily of the whole report, but at least of\r\ncertain issues addressed in it. Moreover, our\r\nconsideration should not be constrained by the one or\r\ntwo days normally allotted for this debate. As stated in\r\nresolution 51/241, on the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system, this agenda item will remain open\r\nduring the year to enable further discussion as\r\nnecessary. Arrangements for further consideration of\r\nthe report are also suggested in this resolution.\r\nFinally, we also hope that the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will be in a position to implement\r\nother aspects of resolution 51/241 pertaining to the\r\nreport of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico\r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic on their election to the\r\nSecurity Council, whose report we are considering.\r\nIf we had to describe it in one word, we would\r\ncall the report elephantine: it is huge, ponderous and,\r\nlike the blind men of Hindoosthan, we can make little\r\nsense of it. We heard the caveats from two of our\r\ncolleagues now across the moat — the Permanent\r\nRepresentatives of Singapore and Colombia — and we\r\ncompliment them on their candour at the formal\r\nmeeting of the Security Council on 18 September 2001,\r\nwhen it adopted this report, and again earlier today.\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter only required\r\nthe Security Council to submit annual and, when\r\nnecessary, special reports to the General Assembly for its\r\nconsideration. But Article 15, paragraph 1, stipulates that\r\nin its reports the Security Council\r\n“shall include an account of the measures that the\r\nSecurity Council has decided upon or taken to\r\nmaintain international peace and security”.\r\nBecause the Council did not do so, General Assembly\r\nresolution 51/193 called upon it to include in its\r\nreports, inter alia, information on its consultations of\r\nthe whole; to highlight the extent to which in its\r\ndecision-making it had taken into account resolutions\r\nof the General Assembly; and to strengthen further the\r\nsection on the steps it had taken to improve its working\r\nmethods.\r\nThe annual “account”, which Article 15 asked of\r\nthe Council, was clearly meant to be both narrative and\r\nreckoning, but it gives neither, and this is the most\r\nserious flaw in its report. As I said when speaking on\r\nthis agenda item in 1998, over and above what\r\nresolution 51/193 asked the Council to do, we would\r\nhave expected an institution’s annual report to include\r\nassessments of how far its activity or decisions had\r\nbeen helpful — for instance, was the political and\r\nsecurity situation in a given country or region better or\r\nworse because the Council had acted there? — and its\r\nown performance as an institution.\r\nWe hope that the views of the membership will\r\nreceive more serious attention from the Council than\r\nappears to have been the case hitherto, as indeed\r\nshould be considered obligatory under Article 24,\r\nwhich states that in carrying out its duties, the Council\r\nacts on behalf of all United Nations Members. The\r\nlatest report, like its predecessors, is still merely a\r\ncompilation of documents already circulated. It has no\r\nanalysis or substantive reporting. It duplicates the\r\nannual compilation of its resolutions and anticipates\r\nthe repertoire of the Council’s practice, but, even as an\r\nexpensive anthology, it is sometimes inadequate,\r\nbecause the summaries are not always accurate\r\nreflections of resolutions and statements.\r\nThe shortcomings of the report are symptoms of\r\nthe larger malaise in the Council. It does not respond to\r\nthe repeatedly expressed wishes of this Assembly\r\nbecause, in its composition, particularly that of the\r\npermanent membership, which wields the real power, it\r\nno longer represents the wider membership, as it\r\nshould. It is prevented from reporting on substance,\r\nbecause its negotiations are held in secret, in a format\r\nnot envisaged in its own Rules of Procedure; it can\r\npresumably claim that it is not reporting on these\r\nmeetings because they have no existence. And yet the\r\nSecretariat services these phantom meetings, budgets\r\nfor them, reports to them and keeps minutes on them.\r\nBoth meetings and records exist, but, like women under\r\nthe Taliban, they are veiled and locked away. What one\r\nhears is the long lament of a disconsolate General\r\nAssembly pursuing and paying for a chimera. At the\r\nvery least, the time might have come to ask some\r\nquestions about rules 55 to 57 of the Council’s Rules of\r\nProcedure.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nIf the informal consultations are to be financed by\r\nMember States, should they not be considered private\r\nmeetings in terms of rule 55? In that case, we would\r\nexpect the Council, under that rule, to issue\r\ncommuniqués through the Secretary-General at the\r\nclose of these meetings and to include them in the\r\nreport to the General Assembly.\r\nIf we are told that the informal consultations are\r\nnot private meetings, should the General Assembly not\r\nask for access to the minutes, which are maintained in\r\nthe office of the Secretary-General? Rule 56 gives the\r\nSecurity Council a veto on access to the records of\r\nprivate meetings, not on these.\r\nIf only to fill out the record, which is all the\r\nreport of the Security Council now is, should it not, in\r\npursuance of rule 57, report on the records and\r\ndocuments that it has declassified each year?\r\nIt must be one of the wryer paradoxes of our\r\ntimes that, as the Iron Curtain fell, the Council set one\r\nup and retreated behind it. Throughout the years of the\r\nCold War, it conducted even its most serious business\r\nin the open. As the world emerged into an era of\r\ncooperation, openness and democracy, the Council\r\nturned into what many have called a Star Chamber.\r\nWhen the General Assembly asked it to be more\r\ntransparent, its response was to hold the open debates,\r\non which it has reported, but which are an empty ritual\r\nfor three reasons.\r\nThe Council has turned itself, on the average of\r\nonce a month, into a debating society. This was not\r\nwhat the Assembly wanted, nor is it a useful way for\r\nthe Council to spend its time and the Organization’s\r\nmoney, unless the debates find a reflection in the\r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nThe Council decides in advance, in its customary\r\nopaque fashion, what the outcome will be. The\r\nstatements made by non-members are therefore an\r\nirrelevance. We wanted the Council to take our views\r\ninto account in its decisions on the issues central to its\r\nwork. That has not happened.\r\nBecause the Council wants complete freedom on\r\nthe core issues of peace and security, it picks for the\r\nopen debates themes the General Assembly should\r\nconsider rather than the Council. Projected as\r\nresponding to the Assembly’s wishes, these debates\r\nactually undermine it.\r\nWhen it holds these open meetings, the Council\r\nclaims to be acting under the powers given to it by\r\nArticle 24 (1) of the Charter “for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security”. Chapters VI-VIII of\r\nthe Charter, however, give it the responsibility to settle\r\ndisputes, to stop both threats to the peace and conflicts\r\nwhen they break out, and the power, under Chapter\r\nVII, to use military and other means to bring this\r\nabout. The Council does not have any powers or role in\r\nthe management of conflict or the conduct of war,\r\nexcept when it oversees a peace-enforcement\r\noperation. The conduct of war is governed by the\r\nGeneva Conventions, with its norms for protection\r\nsupplemented by a variety of human rights instruments.\r\nNone of these give a role to the Security Council.\r\nWhen the Security Council spends so much time,\r\ntherefore, on issues like women and armed conflict,\r\nchildren in armed conflict, or the protection of civilians\r\nin armed conflict, all of which pertain to the\r\nmanagement of conflict, it steps into areas outside its\r\nmandate. That could be condoned if its discussions\r\nadded value. But, in fact, they add nothing to either the\r\nnorms set by international law or its practice.\r\nAny audit of the Council’s performance,\r\ntherefore, would have to conclude that it has not done\r\ntoo well. On two of the gravest threats to peace and\r\nsecurity, Afghanistan under the Taliban and terrorism,\r\nwhich, like snakes, coil in the same pit, striking\r\ntogether or independently, the Council recognized the\r\ndangers but did too little too late. Resolution 1269\r\n(1999) of October 1999 was on the impact of terrorism\r\non international peace and security. Resolution 1267\r\n(1999) addressed the terrorism emanating from the\r\nTaliban-held areas, but very little was done to\r\nimplement them. It took a year and more for the\r\nCouncil, in December 2000, to set up a committee of\r\nexperts to examine how to monitor the implementation\r\nof its sanctions against the Taliban. It then took the\r\nCouncil and the Secretariat nine months to appoint a\r\nmonitoring mechanism. The cost of this\r\nunconscionable delay has been so high that it is\r\nimperative for the Council to ensure that resolution\r\n1373 (2001), adopted last month, is quickly and fully\r\nimplemented.\r\nThe Council’s management of peacekeeping\r\noperations has also been unsatisfactory and bears close\r\nscrutiny. Peacekeeping is a costly instrument; this year,\r\npeacekeeping outlays will be more than twice the\r\nregular budget of the United Nations. Yet the general\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nmembership, which pays the bills and for whom the\r\npeace is expected to be kept, has little information on\r\nhow peacekeeping operations are run, on the problems\r\nthey face, on why certain mandates are set or changed,\r\nor on when and why they are strengthened, scaled\r\ndown or ended. There is not one word on this in the\r\nreport. This is presumably how the armed forces act in\r\nmilitary regimes, but no ministry of defence in a\r\ndemocracy could get away with an attitude as negligent\r\nas this.\r\nBut there is more that ails peacekeeping. As most\r\npeacekeepers are contributed by non-Council members,\r\nwho put the lives of their troops at risk to serve the\r\ncause of international peace, common sense would\r\ndictate a partnership between the Council and the\r\ntroop-contributing countries. This, however, is not the\r\ncase. In February, realizing that there was a crisis\r\nbrewing, the Council established a working group on\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, but this too\r\nhas worked, as the Council and its bodies do, sub rosa.\r\nResolution 1353 (2001), the fruit of its hidden labours,\r\ndisregarded the views expressed by members of the\r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations during\r\na meeting in May this year. It was adopted on the day\r\nwhen, by ironic chance, the Council’s President and\r\ntwo of his Council colleagues were discussing these\r\nvery issues with the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform, where a number of\r\ndelegations protested at the Council’s rushing the\r\nresolution through. All this will have an impact on the\r\nconduct of peacekeeping, but there is almost nothing\r\non this in the report.\r\nIt would, I think, be a fair comment that the\r\nCouncil needs to make better use of its time. It should\r\nfocus on its core mandate, but when budgets are tight,\r\nit must also assess the cost-effectiveness of the\r\noperations it has set up. Some are being scaled back,\r\nothers, serving no purpose and merely a drain on the\r\nUnited Nations resources, need to be shut down. The\r\nGeneral Assembly expects a ruthless scrutiny of every\r\nprogramme brought to it for financing under its results-\r\nbased budget. The Security Council must do at least as\r\nmuch, lopping off deadwood.\r\nMost of those who speak here will be dissatisfied\r\nwith the Council’s work and its report, but, under the\r\nterms of Article 12 of the Charter, the General\r\nAssembly can neither replicate its discussions nor\r\ncompensate for its shortcomings. Apart from anything\r\nelse, the political problems that prevent action in the\r\nCouncil would come into play in this Assembly, which\r\nwould simply go through an ultimately sterile reprise.\r\nAs we have said before, many of the flaws in the\r\nfunctioning of the Council are structural. Its\r\ncomposition is demonstrably out of touch with ground\r\nrealities. The Council neither reflects nor represents the\r\naspirations and views of the larger membership. The\r\nsolution lies in reforming and restructuring the\r\nCouncil. The inclusion of developing countries in the\r\npermanent membership and the expansion of the\r\nCouncil to bring in more non-permanent members from\r\nthe developing world would not only make it more\r\nrepresentative; it would, we are sure, make it much\r\nmore responsive to the needs and wishes of the general\r\nmembership.\r\nHowever, for the moment, we are dealing with a\r\nCouncil that is, in every sense of the word, unreformed.\r\nIn the dying days of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we went through detailed and\r\ninconclusive discussions on how the Council’s report\r\nshould be handled if it was not satisfactory. Our\r\nrecommendation would be to let the Council draw its\r\nown conclusions from this debate and to trust, once\r\nmore, to its better judgement. Without it, more\r\nagonising here would be time ill spent and another\r\nresolution as ineffective as its predecessors.\r\nMr. Cappagli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): In\r\nmatters related to the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil — particularly on issues related to\r\ntransparency — Argentina has the honour to have a\r\nclose working relationship with the delegation of New\r\nZealand, which has informed me that it wishes to be\r\nassociated with this statement.\r\nAmbassador Ryan of Ireland, in his capacity as\r\nPresident of the Security Council, has introduced the\r\nreport of the Security Council contained in document\r\nA/56/2. This gives us an opportunity to reflect on a\r\nvariety of issues that, in our view, contribute to the\r\ntransparency and efficiency of the work of the Council.\r\nThe first issue is the annual report of the Council\r\nto the General Assembly. In our opinion, the report\r\nmust be a clear reflection of the work of the Council.\r\nAlthough there have been some improvements in recent\r\nyears, the report remains nothing more than a good\r\ncompilation and systematization of data. The\r\nSecretariat is not responsible for that limitation. It is\r\nthe Security Council that, from 1974 onwards, has set\r\nthe guidelines for the elaboration of the report. We\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nbelieve that the report should be much more ambitious.\r\nIt should be substantive rather than merely formal,\r\nanalytic rather than simply descriptive. We believe that\r\nthis approach will not only be much more useful to the\r\nrest of the membership, but in most cases will do\r\ngreater justice to the work of the Council.\r\nThe initial paragraphs of the report introduce us\r\nto the second point we wish to touch upon: informal\r\nconsultations. Most of the work of the Council takes\r\nplace in informal consultations. It is true that there has\r\nbeen an increase in the number of public meetings, but\r\nit is also true that the substantive questions continue to\r\nbe negotiated and agreed upon in informal\r\nconsultations. In many cases, the public meeting is\r\nonly a rubber stamp of the discussions that have been\r\nheld during the informals. We acknowledge the\r\nusefulness of thematic debates, which have increased\r\nsignificantly over the past three and in which Argentina\r\nand New Zealand have participated actively. However,\r\nthe real degree of transparency in the work of the\r\nCouncil should be measured not against the number of\r\nthematic debates held, but mainly against the quality of\r\nand opportunity for substantive debates on specific\r\nconflicts included in its agenda. We would recall that,\r\nduring the 1950s and 1960s, most of the meetings of\r\nthe Council were public and that the States not\r\nmembers of the Council therefore had access to its\r\ndeliberations. We believe that the number of informal\r\nconsultations must be reduced and that more\r\nsubstantive open meetings should be held.\r\nHaving said that, we are aware that informal\r\nconsultations are a reality in the life of the Council.\r\nFaced with that reality, we must act, first, to reduce the\r\nnumber of informal consultations and, secondly, to\r\nallow, in specific circumstances, the participation in\r\ninformal consultations of a State that is a party to a\r\ndispute but not a member of the Council. We believe\r\nthat Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter constitute a\r\nsufficient legal basis for this.\r\nOn the other hand, an informal consultation is, by\r\ndefinition, a flexible one. The Council should have\r\nenough political flexibility to allow the participation in\r\ninformal consultations of interested States not members\r\nof the Council. It is true that, on an individual basis\r\nand outside the Council Chamber, Council members\r\nget in touch with the parties to the conflict, but we\r\nbelieve that there are neither legal nor political reasons\r\nfor the Council to collectively ignore the opinions of\r\nthe States parties to a conflict. The participation of\r\ninterested States must not be construed as hindrance of\r\nor delay in the decision-making process. On the\r\ncontrary, it increases the transparency and political\r\nlegitimacy of the decisions of the Security Council.\r\nFrom our experience in the Council, we have\r\nlearnt that the briefings given by the Secretary-General\r\nor his representatives are often not necessarily\r\nconfidential. Their contents can and should be shared\r\nin open meetings. We should invert the current rule. In\r\nprinciple, the briefing must take place in an open\r\nmeeting and, as an exception, in informal\r\nconsultations. This should not exclude the possibility\r\nthat, if Council Members deem it necessary, they may\r\ndecide to have a subsequent discussion in informal\r\nconsultations.\r\nAnother issue that can be discussed in an open\r\nmeeting is the programme of work which the Council\r\nadopts at the start of each month. Such meetings are\r\nthe scene of a rich exchange of views in which the\r\nCouncil sets the main guidelines of its work for the\r\nmonth ahead.\r\nAlso with respect to informal consultations, we\r\nrecall the Argentine initiative set forth in the note by\r\nthe President of the Council issued on 28 February in\r\ndocument S/2000/155, in which newly elected\r\nmembers of the Council are invited to observe the\r\nCouncil’s informal consultations for a period of one\r\nmonth immediately preceding their term of\r\nmembership. This proposal will provide for more\r\ntransparency and allow new members to acquaint\r\nthemselves in advance with the customary procedures\r\nand practices of Council members at these informal\r\nmeetings.\r\nWe think that private meetings can be a useful\r\ntool for the participation of non-members of the\r\nCouncil. But it is necessary to establish clear and\r\nuniform rules for participation. Here, Council practice\r\nhas not been consistent. During the reporting period,\r\nthere have been meetings in which non-members of the\r\nCouncil were allowed to participate, while there have\r\nbeen others where, in spite of their express request,\r\nnon-members were denied participation. One example\r\nwas the private meeting held in June 2000 with the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States to\r\ndiscuss the mandate of the United Nations Mission in\r\nSierra Leone. At that time, the two main troop-\r\ncontributing countries requested in writing to\r\nparticipate, but their requests were denied.\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nThe report indicates that during the reporting\r\nperiod there were more than 30 meetings with troop-\r\ncontributing countries. We are happy to note that there\r\nhas been progress on the initiative of Argentina and\r\nNew Zealand in 1994 to institutionalize such meetings.\r\nSince then, the Council has adopted a number of\r\npresidential statements and resolutions which\r\ndemonstrate a positive trend. Resolution 1353 (2001) is\r\na good example. But in our view, in spite of good\r\nintentions, its provisions have been implemented\r\nerratically and partially. We think that one of the\r\nreasons for this is the fear of Council members, in\r\nparticular the permanent members, that their decision-\r\nmaking power might be weakened or affected by States\r\nthat are not members of the Council. There is no doubt\r\nthat the Security Council bears primary responsibility\r\nto make decisions on matters of international peace and\r\nsecurity. But it is also true that Council decisions\r\ndirectly affect troop contributors, since they bear the\r\nbulk of the risks of any operation. There is thus a duty\r\nto ensure transparency and to give troop contributors\r\nall the information they need to evaluate the situation\r\nobjectively and take their own decisions on whether to\r\nparticipate or withdraw their contingents. That duty of\r\ntransparency is not limited to providing information; it\r\nalso means being receptive to the opinions and\r\nconcerns of troop contributors. That approach would be\r\nconsistent with the spirit of Article 44 of the Charter.\r\nShould the Council not be receptive to this, it risks\r\nadopting mandates that will not be implemented if\r\ntroop contributors think that they are impracticable.\r\nI want to speak also of access by Member States\r\nto the “notes” that are taken by the Secretariat on the\r\ncontent of informal consultations. That matter was\r\ndiscussed during the July meetings of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council. In that connection, we want to\r\nsupport the proposal by Grenada that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral be asked to report on the procedures for\r\nretaining those notes and on the rules governing access\r\nto them. This is a matter of importance because, as we\r\nhave said before, a good deal of the substantive activity\r\nof the Council takes place in informal consultations,\r\nand the Organization allocates significant financial\r\nresources to them. It would be useful to find a suitable\r\nmechanism for creating an institutional memory of all\r\nSecurity Council activities.\r\nWe will not be able to attain the objectives of\r\ntransparency and efficiency while the anachronistic\r\ninstitution of the veto persists. The use or threat of use\r\nof the veto alters the work of the Security Council,\r\neither explicitly or implicitly.\r\nIn our view, transparency also requires a better\r\nrelationship and greater cooperation between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. As\r\nsomeone has said, questions of peace and security must\r\nnot be construed as a duel between the Assembly and\r\nthe Council, but as a constructive, open and continuous\r\ndialogue between two principal organs of the United\r\nNations. In the General Assembly, we must encourage\r\nand strengthen that relationship. Improvements in the\r\nCouncil’s working methods in recent years have led to\r\na more open and constructive atmosphere, but there is\r\nstill a long way to go.\r\nI cannot fail in conclusion to convey our warm\r\nand sincere congratulations to the newly elected\r\nmembers of the Security Council: Bulgaria, Cameroon,\r\nGuinea, Mexico and the Syrian Arab Republic. We\r\nwish them every success in meeting their\r\nresponsibilities. At the same time, we pay tribute to the\r\noutgoing members for their important contribution to\r\nthe promotion of international peace and security.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): I would like to express\r\nAustria’s gratitude to the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, Ambassador Richard Ryan, for his eloquent\r\nintroduction of the report of the Security Council\r\n(A/56/2). My delegation also commends the excellent\r\nwork of the Secretariat in compiling this invaluable\r\nreference source. This occasion is a welcome\r\ncontinuation of the Security Council’s dialogue with\r\nthe General Assembly in the discharge of its duties\r\npursuant to Article 24 of the Charter. This practice\r\nenhances the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, bearing in mind\r\nthe responsibility of the Assembly to act on behalf of\r\nthe whole membership.\r\nAn adequate flow of information towards non-\r\nmembers of the Council is a necessary prerequisite for\r\nunderstanding and assessing how the Council is dealing\r\nwith political issues; it should therefore be facilitated\r\nas much as possible. In our view, the presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council has a crucial role to play in keeping\r\nthe general membership fully informed on the\r\ndeliberations of the Council. In that regard, the\r\nmonthly forecast of the work of the Council constitutes\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\na useful tool for the daily work of delegations. The\r\nbriefings of the respective presidencies and the\r\ninformation they make available via their homepages\r\nhave been further improved over the past year. In\r\naddition, the increase in the number of public meetings\r\nunderlines the willingness of the Council to take into\r\naccount the views of Member States and to use them as\r\na basis for the Council’s decision-making process.\r\nThe inclusion in the report of monthly\r\nassessments of the work of the Security Council by\r\nformer Presidents is very positive. The relevance of\r\nthose assessments could be further increased if they\r\ncovered and analysed more extensively the decision-\r\nmaking process in the Council instead of focusing too\r\nmuch on merely factual events. Some members of the\r\nCouncil, as well as non-members, have also raised the\r\nquestion of why the report covers a period starting and\r\nending in the middle of a month and have suggested\r\nsynchronizing the start and end of the reporting period\r\nwith presidential terms. We suggest that that proposal\r\nbe seriously considered for future reports.\r\nThe experience of peacekeeping operations has\r\nclearly underlined that the Council can act successfully\r\nonly if it is engaged in a substantial dialogue with\r\nMember States. In that regard, my delegation, as a\r\ntraditional contributor to peacekeeping operations,\r\nparticularly welcomes the Council’s efforts to increase\r\nthe number of meetings with troop-contributing\r\ncountries and thus to improve the cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the Council and such countries at\r\nan early stage in the consideration of United Nations\r\nmissions and their mandates.\r\nThe relationship between the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly is undoubtedly a central\r\nissue of the ongoing reform debate. The maintenance\r\nof efficiency, as well as the utmost possible degree of\r\ntransparency and legitimacy, are equally important\r\ngoals that should guide the reform efforts of the\r\nSecurity Council. The high-level Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform can, however, only come up\r\nwith concrete proposals if the underlying political\r\nimpasse is overcome by a reconsideration of positions\r\nin major capitals of the world.\r\nI can reassure you and the President that my\r\ndelegation will continue to support every reform effort\r\ndirected at increased transparency, efficiency and\r\nlegitimacy so that the Security Council can best fulfil\r\nits mandate under the Charter.\r\nMr. Sun Joun-yung (Republic of Korea): I would\r\nlike to begin by thanking the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, Ambassador Richard Ryan of Ireland, for his\r\nclear-cut presentation of the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly. I also wish\r\nto express my appreciation to the Secretariat for\r\npreparing such an in-depth and informative report. My\r\ndelegation has long maintained that the annual report\r\nof the Security Council can be an important tool for\r\nensuring cooperation between the Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in accordance with the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Charter, in particular, Articles 15 and\r\n24.\r\nBefore getting into the details of the report, I\r\ncannot help but comment on the subject of terrorism,\r\nwhich has become the most urgent issue facing the\r\nSecurity Council as the primary body responsible for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. I\r\nwould like to reiterate the need for all United Nations\r\norgans, and the Security Council in particular, to play\r\nan active role in the prevention and suppression of\r\ninternational terrorism. In this regard, I welcome the\r\nprompt adoption of Security Council resolution 1368\r\n(2001), which strongly condemns the heinous acts of\r\nterrorism on 11 September, and resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nwhich demonstrates the Security Council’s strong will\r\nto combat any form of international terrorism. I also\r\nwelcome the establishment of the counter-terrorism\r\ncommittee pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) and wish\r\nthe committee success in fulfilling its mandate.\r\nAs the tragic events of 11 September made\r\npainfully clear, nobody is free from the scourge of\r\nterrorism. These abominable acts were an assault not\r\nonly on the United States, but also on the international\r\ncommunity as a whole — indeed on human dignity\r\nitself. Therefore, it should be the responsibility and\r\nwill of the entire international community to eliminate\r\nterrorism in all its forms and to hold accountable those\r\nwho perpetrate it.\r\nI am also pleased to note that, during the General\r\nAssembly’s timely debate on terrorism earlier this\r\nmonth, Member States denounced terrorism in\r\nunequivocal terms. In this context, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the statement by the President of the General\r\nAssembly and the adoption of General Assembly\r\nresolution 56/1, in which the whole United Nations\r\nmembership reaffirmed its commitment to combat\r\nterrorism and pool its resources for that purpose. I\r\nbelieve that this consensus and unity bode well for the\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\ncooperative international effort against terrorism. At\r\nthe same time, my delegation stresses the importance\r\nof translating our commitments into action. For our\r\npart, the Republic of Korea will move promptly to fully\r\nimplement the aforementioned United Nations\r\nresolutions.\r\nAs the annual report made evident, the Security\r\nCouncil has made remarkable progress in a number of\r\nkey areas. I would like to take a few moments to\r\ncomment on some of the topics to which my delegation\r\nattaches particular importance. As we reflect on the\r\nSecurity Council’s work over the course of the past\r\nyear, I would like to first reaffirm my delegation’s\r\nsupport for the recommendations contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s far-reaching June report on the\r\nprevention of armed conflicts. As I remarked at the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly meetings\r\nthis past June and July, respectively, we hope to see\r\nimproved interaction among the major United Nations\r\nbodies, particularly between the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly, in developing long-term conflict\r\nprevention and peace-building strategies. My\r\ndelegation welcomes Security Council resolution 1366\r\n(2001), adopted on 30 August, expressing the need for\r\nthe Security Council to play a central role in conflict\r\nprevention, in conjunction with other United Nations\r\norgans, regional organizations and key civil society\r\nactors. I sincerely hope that the “culture of prevention”\r\nenvisioned by the Secretary-General will take root in\r\nyears to come.\r\nMy second point relates to Security Council\r\nmissions. As noted in the annual report, this year saw\r\nan increase in the number of Security Council missions\r\nto areas of potential conflict. My delegation agrees\r\nwith the notion, articulated in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the prevention of armed conflicts, that\r\nSecurity Council fact-finding missions can be a useful\r\ninstrument in conflict prevention. I hope that this\r\nyear’s increase signifies a trend towards a more\r\nproactive use of such missions by the Security Council.\r\nThirdly, my delegation hopes that the Security\r\nCouncil can be reformed in a way that makes it more\r\ndemocratic, transparent and effective, in order to better\r\nmeet the challenges of the new millennium. To this\r\nend, the Republic of Korea has been actively\r\nparticipating in the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform. While we bemoan the lack of\r\ntangible progress in the Working Group, we are pleased\r\nthat the Security Council has taken a number of steps\r\nto improve its working methods, including more\r\nfrequent public meetings and improved briefings for\r\nnon-members.\r\nIn particular, we welcome the adoption of\r\nCouncil resolution 1327 (2000), which underlined the\r\nimportance of close consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing countries in peacekeeping matters, a\r\nprocess that would enhance transparency. As a troop-\r\ncontributing country and strong advocate of Security\r\nCouncil reform, the Republic of Korea fully supports\r\nstrengthening cooperation between the Council and\r\ntroop-contributing countries, particularly in light of the\r\nrecent resurgence of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. We hope that an improved system of\r\nconsultations will be worked out, so that the views of\r\ncountries contributing to operations can be\r\nappropriately reflected in the Security Council’s\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nWhile recognizing the Council’s success in\r\npeacekeeping operations this past year, an exemplary\r\ncase being East Timor, my delegation also reaffirms the\r\nneed to continue to implement the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Brahimi report on this matter.\r\nFinally, I would like to share two general\r\nobservations. First, while I am sincerely grateful to the\r\nSecretariat for compiling such an exhaustive,\r\nvoluminous report, I share the view of many Member\r\nStates that the current report could have been more\r\nilluminating if it had taken a more analytical and user-\r\nfriendly approach. In this regard, I welcome the efforts\r\nbeing put forth by the Working Group to study ways\r\nand means of making the annual report more relevant\r\nto the work of the General Assembly.\r\nSecondly, while the Security Council’s open\r\ndebates provide a useful forum for delegations to share\r\ntheir views on subjects in a broad context, they have\r\noften struck me as a bit generic and formal. While\r\nacknowledging the efforts of some Council members to\r\ngive non-members the opportunity to participate in a\r\ncandid exchange of views on security matters, I hope\r\nthat, in future, these meetings can be developed into\r\ntrue debates.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing my delegation’s\r\nhope that the newly elected members of the Security\r\nCouncil — Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and\r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic — will play an active and\r\nsuccessful role in international security matters in\r\nfuture. For its part, the Republic of Korea remains\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\ncommitted to enhancing the Security Council’s\r\ncapacity to fulfil its mandate for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): The increasing\r\ndemands on the Security Council for responses to\r\nconflicts, threats and breaches of peace, and the\r\nmagnitude of the tasks it is called upon to undertake,\r\nare evident in the Council’s report (A/56/2), covering\r\nthe period between 16 June 2000 and 15 June 2001.\r\nThe 173 formal meetings, the 185 informal\r\nconsultations, the 57 resolutions and the 72 reports of\r\nthe Secretary-General considered by the Council\r\nconstitute the body of this annual report, which the\r\nSecurity Council, pursuant to Article 24 of the United\r\nNations Charter, is submitting to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe submission of this voluminous report —\r\nwhich, according to the Charter, is expected to contain\r\na substantive, analytical and material account of the\r\nwork of the Council — is in itself evidence of that\r\nbody’s accountability to the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe numbers show that, though closed-door\r\nmeetings have decreased, they are still more numerous\r\nthan the open, formal meetings. Though there are good\r\nreasons for closed meetings, by definition they lack\r\ntransparency and send a message of exclusion to the\r\nrest of the United Nations membership. No degree of\r\nbriefing following these closed meetings could provide\r\nthe same amount of information as that received by\r\nwitnessing the Council’s open meetings and listening to\r\nits deliberations.\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council have improved,\r\nthough there will always be room for further\r\nimprovement. We welcome again the inclusion in the\r\nreport of monthly statements by the Council’s outgoing\r\nPresidents; the continuing briefings of delegations and\r\nthe press by the presidency; the increase in\r\nconsultations with troop-contributing States; and the\r\nCouncil’s general trend towards openness.\r\nTransparency and good working methods are having\r\npositive effects, especially in the case of peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nWith respect to the substantive aspect, the report\r\ndemonstrates that not only have conflicts and crises in\r\nthe world not diminished, they have instead increased,\r\nand, in the case of terrorism, they have become more\r\ncomplex. Militant separatist terrorism constitutes one\r\nof the gravest threats facing humankind. It poses a\r\nclear and present danger to the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of States, to life, stability, prosperity and even\r\nto peace and security. We feel that the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly have acted with prudence\r\nand determination in adopting resolutions for its\r\neradication.\r\nThese new crises, regrettably, join a number of\r\nlong-standing problems which remain unresolved due\r\nto lack of political will and the non-implementation of\r\nmandatory resolutions and decisions. Selectivity in the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions shakes\r\nthe faith of the general membership of the United\r\nNations, especially that of the small States. The\r\nobligation of all States to conform without exception to\r\nthe Council’s decisions is part of the Charter, whose\r\nprovisions we are all committed to complying with.\r\nWe all expect and hope for a Council that is able\r\nto face the new challenges of a new century. To achieve\r\nthis goal, the Council must, first, be representative,\r\nreflecting the realities of a changed world. Increasing\r\nits membership on the basis of an equitable\r\ngeographical distribution of seats, in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories, will give the\r\nCouncil more legitimacy and strengthen its\r\neffectiveness. The increase will render decisions more\r\ncredible to all of those States on behalf of which it was\r\nmandated to act.\r\nSecondly, it must have sufficient funds and\r\npersonnel, a necessary prerequisite for a strong\r\nSecurity Council, so that, as the Secretary-General has\r\nstated, it never lets down those who have placed their\r\nfaith in it. Thirdly, we should remember that no reform\r\ncan be more effective and useful than the determination\r\nof the Security Council to implement its own\r\nresolutions and decisions. Finally, it is our view that\r\nArticle 43 of the United Nations Charter should, in\r\nthese grave and complex times, be fully implemented,\r\nmaking available to the Council on its call armed\r\nforces for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe need for a good relationship between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, the two\r\nmain organs of the United Nations, and for\r\ncoordination of their responsibilities cannot be\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\noveremphasized. The Secretariat’s strict adherence to\r\nthe decisions of these main organs forms the basis for\r\nincreasing the credibility of our Organization.\r\nWe agree with India’s recent suggestion to\r\nincorporate into the report an assessment by the\r\nSecurity Council of the usefulness and helpfulness of\r\nits own actions. We also support greater collaboration\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\r\nso long as this collaboration is based on the Charter\r\nand on the promotion of goals in line with its\r\nprovisions.\r\nFinally, I would like to congratulate Bulgaria,\r\nCameroon, Guinea, Mexico and Syria on their election\r\nto the Security Council, and at the same time to thank\r\nthis important organ of the United Nations for its\r\nefforts to find a just and lasting solution to the problem\r\nof Cyprus.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): My delegation\r\nwould like to join the preceding speakers in thanking\r\nthe President of the Security Council, Ambassador\r\nRichard Ryan of Ireland, for having introduced the\r\nCouncil’s annual report to the General Assembly. As\r\nothers have done, I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto extend my delegation’s warmest congratulations to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and to the entire membership of this\r\nOrganization, on the Nobel Peace Prize that has been\r\nconferred on him and the United Nations. The\r\nMongolian delegation firmly believes that this has been\r\ndone in recognition of the efforts that our Organization\r\nhas made, and the increasing role and responsibility it\r\nhas assumed, to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity and achieve other noble goals of the Charter. It\r\nis also a recognition and support of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s personal efforts and those of his dedicated\r\nstaff to enhance the role and reshape the activities of\r\nthis Organization in response to the basic and emerging\r\nneeds of today’s globalizing world.\r\nArticle 15 of the Charter mandates that the\r\nGeneral Assembly annually consider and assess the\r\nwork of the Council, which, under the Charter, has\r\nbroad powers to take decisions regarding the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and act\r\non behalf of the entire membership. My delegation\r\nattaches great importance to such examinations. They\r\npromote constitutional and viable links between the\r\ntwo main bodies of the United Nations. They also\r\nenhance transparency and accountability in the work of\r\nthe Council. Although the report mainly represents a\r\nreproduction of documents, it nevertheless clearly\r\nshows the scope and intensity of the activities\r\nconducted by the Council during the past year. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the important decisions taken by\r\nthe Council throughout the year to strengthen peace\r\nand security, prevent further escalation of\r\nconfrontations and promote peace-building in different\r\nparts of the world. In this connection, my delegation\r\nfully agrees with the view that the report fails to\r\nexplain why the Council has not been fully involved in\r\nthe conflict in the Middle East, a region that demands\r\ngrowing attention, diffusion of tensions and a\r\nconstructive solution.\r\nIt is my delegation’s view that the United Nations\r\nrole in peacekeeping must be further increased and\r\nimproved. We believe that the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Brahimi report ought to be vigorously\r\nimplemented.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the ongoing efforts\r\nto further enhance the effectiveness of the Council and\r\nto ensure greater participation of non-member States in\r\nthe Council’s work through organizing open thematic\r\ndebates and discussions on pressing issues. The\r\norganization of such debates and discussions is useful\r\nand ought to be continued. The themes, on the other\r\nhand, should be directly pertinent to the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Council.\r\nThough the present report covers the period from\r\nJune 2000 to June 2001, my delegation believes that it\r\nis relevant to express its views and position on the\r\nCouncil’s activities in response to the inhuman terrorist\r\nacts committed in the United States on 11 September.\r\nThe Government and people of Mongolia fully\r\nassociate themselves with the firm commitment of the\r\ninternational community to the common fight against\r\nterrorism and strongly support the Council’s consensus\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) as well as the\r\nAssembly’s resolution 56/1 to combat and eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism. My delegation believes that the\r\nSecurity Council Committee on counter-terrorism,\r\nspecifically established to monitor implementation of\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), will prove to be an effective\r\ncollective mechanism to fight international terrorism. It\r\nis my delegation’s hope that the Committee will soon\r\ndraw up its work programme. My delegation hopes that\r\nall Member States will report to the Committee on the\r\nmeasures and steps taken to implement the above\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nresolution within 90 days, as specified in the\r\nresolution.\r\nThe Council’s reform is high on the agenda of the\r\nOrganization’s reform strategy. My delegation would\r\nlike to underline once again the need to speed up the\r\nCouncil’s reform. It is regrettable that not much\r\nprogress has been registered during the past year.\r\nMongolia continues to believe that the number of both\r\npermanent and non-permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil should be expanded, and that representatives\r\nof developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica, along with the major industrialized powers,\r\nshould be represented among the permanent members\r\non the Council. Mongolia supports a reasonable\r\nincrease in non-permanent seats, reflecting the\r\nrepresentative character of the Council and enabling a\r\ngrowing number of member States to contribute to its\r\nwork.\r\nMy delegation would like to reiterate its position\r\nthat an important part of the Council’s reform should\r\ndeal with the use of the veto power, which, in its view,\r\nought to be considerably curtailed. In this context, my\r\ndelegation would like to suggest that the General\r\nAssembly should perhaps, when deemed necessary, be\r\nable to address openly why vetoes had been cast in\r\ncertain cases, ask for explanations and, in return,\r\ncommunicate the views of the general membership on\r\nthe issue to the Council.\r\nConcerning the format of the report, we have\r\nbeen hearing over the past three years in this hall\r\ncritical remarks calling the report mainly a\r\nreproduction of the resolutions and decisions adopted\r\nby the Council. Moreover, delegations have been\r\nmaking not only critical — yet constructive —\r\nobservations, but also practical, meaningful\r\nsuggestions and proposals to make the reports more\r\nanalytical and comprehensible. However, as is evident\r\nfrom the present report and our deliberations today, the\r\nCouncil has, unfortunately, failed to respond positively.\r\nThe guidelines for the preparation and format of\r\nthe Security Council’s reports to the General Assembly,\r\nlast updated in 1997, refer to making reports more\r\nanalytical in character. Proposals were also made to\r\ncondense the reports and make them more substantive\r\nand informative. However, those recommendations\r\nhave not found due reflection in the past three reports.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation fully associates itself\r\nwith the spirit of the frank comments made earlier this\r\nmorning by Ambassador Mahbubani of Singapore on\r\nimproving the substance of the Council’s reports. We\r\nbelieve that the guidelines should be updated, taking\r\ninto account the constructive and practical proposals\r\nmade by Member States since 1998, including those\r\nexpressed during the consideration of this item at this\r\nplenary meeting.\r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity, as\r\nwe are considering the Council’s report, to sincerely\r\ncongratulate Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and\r\nSyria on their election to the Council last week, and to\r\nexpress my delegation’s hope that they will make an\r\nimportant contribution to the future work of the\r\nCouncil, bearing in mind the sentiments expressed and\r\nthe proposals made during the present debate.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwould like to express our gratitude to Ambassador\r\nRichard Ryan, the Permanent Representative of\r\nIreland, for the presentation of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council. That report is submitted in\r\naccordance with Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter and\r\nreaffirms a principle that the delegation of Egypt holds\r\ndearly regarding the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, namely, the\r\nprinciple of allowing the Assembly to assume its\r\ninherent responsibility in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security in accordance with the\r\nCharter. This should allow the Assembly to follow the\r\nwork of the Council, discuss the measures it has\r\nundertaken and adopt the necessary recommendations\r\nabout them.\r\nAllow me to present Egypt’s views on the\r\nworking methods of the Council at present, as well as\r\nour comments regarding the continued existence of a\r\nnumber of obvious shortcomings in those methods.\r\nThose shortcomings have not been properly addressed\r\nduring the period covered by the report, and have\r\nconsequences on international security. We must also\r\nacknowledge that members of the Council are trying to\r\nrespond to many of the points that have already been\r\nmade by the wider membership. We would like to say\r\nthe following.\r\nFirst, we note that the Security Council has\r\nincreased both its public and its open meetings during\r\nthe past year. However, we also note a continued effort\r\nby the Council to vary the format of its sessions, as\r\nwell as undeniable creativity by the Council in setting\r\nartificial criteria for attending or participating in those\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nsessions. We believe this method makes the Council a\r\nselective body, and even an ambiguous one where a\r\ntiny number of voices constantly strive to expand their\r\ncontrol and will over other members, both within and\r\noutside the Council. Those members are often severely\r\naffected by the Council’s decisions in spite of their\r\ntotal non-participation in the decision-making process.\r\nSecondly, under this working method, which is\r\nmostly characterized by non-transparency, the Council\r\nhas considered two issues of great importance that have\r\na direct impact on international peace and security.\r\nThose issues are the situation in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories and the struggle against\r\ninternational terrorism. With regard to the situation in\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories, the Security\r\nCouncil failed several times during the past year to\r\nreach a decision on the request to deploy international\r\nobservers to monitor the situation between the\r\noccupying Power and the occupied Palestinian people.\r\nIn spite of the long and numerous consultations in the\r\nCouncil and the exhaustive explanations provided to\r\nthe Council by the Arab countries about the importance\r\nof deploying such observers to help the two parties\r\ncontrol the situation, the Council failed repeatedly to\r\nadopt a decision in that regard for a number of reasons.\r\nIn the absence of any meaningful international\r\nmediation in the conflict, this failure has certainly\r\ncontributed to the deterioration of the situation and to\r\nthe increase in the number of victims, most of whom\r\nare Palestinians.\r\nDuring the Council’s deliberations we heard\r\nseveral views on this particularly important issue. It\r\nseemed that some of the members of the Council were\r\nnot convinced that the Council even has a role in the\r\nwhole question of the Middle East. It also seemed that\r\nthose members wanted to turn facts and legal reasoning\r\nupside down by claiming that the Council should seek\r\npermission from the occupying Power in order to adopt\r\na resolution to deploy international observers. Since we\r\nall realize what military occupation means, and what\r\nrepressive and brutal acts it entails, this so-called\r\nargument could only be interpreted by us as a clear\r\nabdication by the Council of its responsibility to\r\nprovide the necessary protection to the occupied\r\nPalestinian people, and as a flagrant implication of its\r\ninfamous policy of double standards, which we have\r\nconsistently criticized.\r\nThirdly, as to the issue of combating terrorism, let\r\nme state here that Egypt’s position was set out in detail\r\nbefore the Assembly during the relevant debate. Egypt\r\nviews the adoption of Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001) positively and looks forward to cooperating\r\nwith other States for a better and more effective fight\r\nagainst terrorism. Yet it comes as no secret to many\r\nthat the Council’s resolution, which places all Member\r\nStates under Chapter VII of the Charter — thereby\r\nsetting a serious precedent in the history of the\r\nCouncil — was adopted in a matter of a few days. We\r\nheard from the majority of the members of the Council\r\nand from the general membership that very little time\r\nwas afforded for any careful study of the resolution.\r\nMember States, which will have to comply with the\r\nprovisions of the resolution, did not have a proper\r\nopportunity to express their views on its contents.\r\nRegardless of the legal shortcomings of the\r\nresolution, the fact that the Security Council has\r\nestablished an international framework to be imposed\r\non the Member States by virtue of the Charter’s\r\nprovisions with a view to legislate and organize\r\ncooperation and better coordination among members of\r\nthe international family on an issue that is currently\r\nunder the consideration of the General Assembly,\r\nconstitutes a dangerous precedent that is not in the\r\ninterest of the United Nations nor in the interest of our\r\ncollective system as established by the founding fathers\r\nof the Organization.\r\nImproving the Council’s working methods and\r\nincreasing the transparency of its conduct is a single\r\nelement in our quest for comprehensive reform in the\r\nwork and composition of the Council in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. My delegation will continue to participate\r\nactively in the discussion of this issue through the\r\nrelevant working group, which we anticipate will soon\r\nresume its work.\r\nThe Security Council is a major organ that has an\r\nimportant and serious role. The general membership\r\nwill look up to the Council in all seriousness so long as\r\nit undertakes its responsibilities seriously. The general\r\nmembership looks to the Council when a grave crisis\r\narises in the expectation that it will intervene on its\r\nbehalf in a rational and decisive manner in order to\r\ndefuse crises or to contain them and ultimately control\r\nand settle them. But if the Council does not assume its\r\nresponsibilities with the seriousness required of it, or if\r\nit fails to perform its duty when faced with a grave\r\ncrisis, all States Members of the Organization have the\r\nright, and even the duty, to speak out and express their\r\nviews in the hope that the members of the Council will\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nacknowledge the shortcomings in its working methods\r\nand try to reform them so that the Council can become\r\na just, even-handed and balanced organ that is\r\ntransparent in its work.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): I, too, join in thanking\r\nAmbassador Ryan for his introduction of the report. I\r\nwould also like to thank the Security Council\r\nsecretariat staff for their excellent work.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, the annual report\r\ncontinues to be an important and substantial\r\ncontribution to transparency in the work of the Council\r\nvis-à-vis the overall United Nations membership. Both\r\ninside and outside the Council, Norway has been, and\r\nwill continue to be, actively engaged in the efforts to\r\nimprove the Council’s openness and effectiveness.\r\nNorway therefore remains committed to\r\npromoting annual reports from the Council to the\r\nAssembly and to working to make these reports even\r\nmore informative and useful to the membership at\r\nlarge. We have been listening carefully to all the\r\ninteresting comments and suggestions made in the\r\ndebate today, and will consider them carefully in future\r\ndeliberations.\r\nTransparency has indeed been improved over\r\nrecent years, in terms of more open briefings and\r\nmeetings with the participation of non-Council\r\nmembers. But we recognize that more needs to be\r\ndone, in particular with regard to the involvement of\r\ntroop-contributing countries in the decision-shaping\r\nprocess of the Council.\r\nNorway will continue to work constructively in\r\nthe Council and its Working Group on Peacekeeping\r\nOperations to follow up resolution 1353 (2001) and to\r\nestablish more satisfactory arrangements for the\r\nparticipation of troop-contributing countries. At the\r\nsame time, it is the responsibility of all — Council\r\nmembers and troop contributors alike — to make the\r\nmaximum use of the potential of the important\r\nestablished practice of regular meetings between the\r\nCouncil and troop-contributing countries. My\r\ndelegation is of the opinion that more could be done to\r\nmake meetings with troop-contributing countries more\r\nsubstantive and effective.\r\nThe annual report clearly shows the scope and\r\nintensity of the Council’s activities in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. Norway welcomes\r\nthe fact that the international community increasingly\r\nturns to the United Nations for multilateral solutions to\r\nconflicts and other threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, such as terrorism. The 2001 Nobel Peace\r\nPrize award testifies to the crucial global role of the\r\nUnited Nations and its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan.\r\nMy Government continues to be firmly convinced\r\nthat the United Nations remains indispensable when it\r\ncomes to building common ground for collective action\r\nto meet the security threats of the twenty-first century,\r\nnot least in Africa, where an array of complex\r\nchallenges will continue to demand the full attention,\r\nnot only of the Council, but of the entire United\r\nNations system. Successful management of the\r\ncomplex crises in Africa and elsewhere requires a\r\nmultifaceted approach to building sustainable peace\r\nand development. Peace and security issues are closely\r\ninterconnected with issues that are the responsibility of\r\nthe General Assembly, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and other organs and agencies of the United\r\nNations system. Regional and subregional\r\norganizations have also become important partners in\r\nthe United Nations efforts to promote peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNorway will continue to work to strengthen the\r\ncooperation between the Council and the various\r\nUnited Nations and other bodies and organizations\r\ninvolved in areas such as poverty reduction,\r\nhumanitarian aid, development assistance, human\r\nrights and the environment. This is in line with our\r\nfocus on a comprehensive approach to peace-building,\r\nand with the recommendations in the Brahimi report.\r\nWe believe that increased attention to the root causes\r\nof conflict is good long-term crisis management.\r\nIt is of vital importance to all Members of the\r\nUnited Nations that the authority and legitimacy of the\r\nSecurity Council remain strong and undiminished as it\r\nmakes efforts to fulfil its primary role in international\r\npeace and security. Making the Council more\r\nrepresentative, while ensuring its efficiency, is crucial\r\nin this regard.\r\nNorway welcomes the newly elected members of\r\nthe Security Council — Bulgaria, Guinea, Cameroon,\r\nMexico and the Syrian Arab Republic — and looks\r\nforward to working together with them in the Council\r\nin 2002. We also look forward to developing further the\r\ndialogue and cooperation with other members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I can assure the Assembly that\r\nNorway’s commitment to supporting the United\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nNations system and its efforts at global peace and\r\ncooperation remains as firm as ever.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): I begin by thanking the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador Richard\r\nRyan of Ireland, for his introduction of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly for the year\r\nto 15 June 2001.\r\nAs we discuss the report of the Security Council,\r\nwe recognize the challenges we face in the months and\r\nyears ahead in the pursuit of peace and security for all\r\nthe peoples of the world. It is in this context that my\r\ndelegation takes this opportunity to extend our heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, and to the Organization he leads, for having\r\nbeen awarded this year’s Nobel Peace Prize for their\r\ncontribution to the building of a better organized and\r\nmore peaceful world.\r\nWe are at a point in the history of the United\r\nNations when the role of the Security Council as a\r\ncentral organ of the United Nations is clearly\r\npronounced. It is therefore up to us to ensure that the\r\nCouncil’s work is conducted in the most transparent\r\nmanner and that Member States participate as much as\r\npracticable in the deliberative process.\r\nDuring the past 21 months as an elected member\r\nof the Council, Jamaica has worked with others to\r\nincrease the transparency of the Council’s work and to\r\nincrease participation by non-members in the Council’s\r\ndeliberations. The Council has come a long way in\r\nthese two areas, and a new culture is emerging.\r\nWe are particularly pleased that Member States\r\nhave taken full advantage of the expanded\r\nopportunities to participate in the increased number of\r\nopen debates on a wide range of issues. There has also\r\nbeen considerably improved communication with\r\nMember States, in particular with those affected by\r\nCouncil actions. In this vein, the Council has\r\nbroadened the input of Members and other interested\r\nparties by reaching out to them in different forums and\r\nby providing opportunities for their participation. We\r\nagree that the Council must build on these\r\nimprovements to enhance its capacity to meet its\r\nresponsibilities to Member States and the United\r\nNations as a whole in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nDuring this reporting period, the Council has\r\nembraced the maxim that in order to deal effectively\r\nwith conflict situations the regional dynamics of these\r\nconflicts must be fully taken into account. The\r\nsolutions devised for Council action must therefore\r\nemploy a regional perspective, and the concerns of\r\nStates in each respective region must be factored into\r\nthe decision-making process. This paradigm shift has\r\nbeen most evident as the Council tackled the conflicts\r\nin the Great Lakes and Mano River regions of Africa.\r\nThe Council’s approach has been ably complemented\r\nby the Secretary-General’s own focus on the regional\r\ndimensions of these conflicts.\r\nIn recognition of the role of the Security Council\r\nin conflict prevention, the Secretary-General has\r\nundertaken to submit periodic regional and subregional\r\nreports to the Security Council on disputes that may\r\npotentially threaten international peace and security.\r\nJamaica fully supports this initiative and urges the\r\nSecurity Council, the Secretary-General and other\r\norgans of the United Nations to develop regional\r\nprevention strategies, and to do so in cooperation with\r\nregional and subregional organizations.\r\nOver the past year, the Security Council has been\r\nseized of a number of issues, particularly in Africa, the\r\nBalkans and Central Asia. As we reflect on the work of\r\nthe Security Council during this period, we cannot help\r\nbut recognize the progress made in bringing peace\r\ncloser to being a reality in a number of areas. We are\r\nalso cognizant that even as progress is achieved in\r\nsome there remain many seemingly intractable\r\nproblems in others. The Council must continue to work\r\nwith the relevant parties in the search for solutions in a\r\nnumber of these areas, and we must develop new ways\r\nto bring peace to these regions.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\r\nCouncil has given full support to the Facilitator of the\r\nInter-Congolese Dialogue and has used the resources at\r\nits disposal to urge support for the peace process. This\r\nincludes the Security Council mission to the Great\r\nLakes region, which provided Council members with a\r\nbroad perspective of the issues and a clearer\r\nunderstanding of the difficulties yet to be overcome. It\r\nalso provided the countries in the region, as well as the\r\naffected parties, with a sense of the Council’s\r\ncommitment to the peace process, while providing the\r\nCouncil with the opportunity to deal directly with the\r\nparties to assert the Council’s determination in moving\r\nthe peace process forward, to hear first-hand the\r\nconcerns of the affected parties and to seek their\r\ncommitment to the peace process. In this context, I\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nwish to emphasize that Jamaica will continue to\r\nsupport Security Council missions where appropriate\r\nand desirable to advance the cause of peace.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, the Council has continued its\r\nstrong support for the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone (UNAMSIL) and has shown its appreciation for\r\nthe contributions of troop-contributing countries to\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. The Security\r\nCouncil mission to Sierra Leone, which also visited\r\nother countries in the West African region, highlighted\r\nthe regional dimensions of the conflict and contributed\r\nsignificantly to the advance of the peace process.\r\nHowever, the Council and the international community\r\nhave yet to find an appropriate formula for funding\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-\r\ncombatants. We will be faced very soon with the same\r\nproblem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and\r\nwe urge the Secretary-General to make\r\nrecommendations that are deemed to be most viable for\r\nCouncil consideration. We will continue to work within\r\nthe Security Council and the United Nations system as\r\na whole to find an appropriate solution to this problem,\r\nand we urge all Member States to take part in the\r\ndiscussion of this issue.\r\nResolution of the conflicts in Angola and Burundi\r\nand between Ethiopia and Eritrea also received the\r\nfocused attention of the Security Council. Where\r\ndifficulties remain in resolving these conflicts, it is\r\nincumbent on the Security Council and the Member\r\nStates to place increased emphasis on urging those\r\nStates that can affect the outcome of these conflicts to\r\nhelp rather than to hinder the peace process.\r\nWhile we have spent a great deal of time on\r\nseeking solutions to certain conflicts in Africa, we have\r\nnot paid sufficient attention to others, particularly in\r\nthe peace-building phase. This is particularly evident in\r\nthe tenuous post-conflict peace-building situations in\r\nthe Central African Republic and in Somalia. We must\r\nfind new ways to engage and support our partners in\r\nthis area. We must continue to engage other United\r\nNations organs, funds and agencies in the peace-\r\nbuilding and conflict prevention process.\r\nThe Council remains fully engaged in moving\r\nforward the peace processes in Kosovo and East Timor,\r\nwith the latter moving closer to becoming the one\r\nhundred and ninetieth Member of the United Nations.\r\nThe two Council missions to Kosovo and its visit to\r\nBelgrade resulted in greater cooperation on the issues\r\nfaced by the United Nations Interim Administration\r\nMission in Kosovo, and the lifting of the arms embargo\r\non the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Council\r\nmissions to East Timor and Indonesia significantly\r\nadvanced the prospect for success in the United\r\nNations Transitional Administration in East Timor, as\r\nEast Timor moves closer to independence.\r\nJamaica joins in the support given to the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts on issues such as the\r\nprevention of armed conflicts, children and armed\r\nconflict, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict, and women and peace and\r\nsecurity — issues of major concern to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn the first place, the Council’s debate on HIV/\r\nAIDS set the stage for the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, held in June this year.\r\nSecondly, on 31 October 2000, the Security\r\nCouncil adopted groundbreaking resolution 1325\r\n(2000) on women and peace and security. This\r\nresolution, the first of its kind, reaffirmed the important\r\nrole of women in the prevention and resolution of\r\nconflicts and in peace-building. It called upon all actors\r\ninvolved in negotiating and implementing peace\r\nagreements to adopt a gender perspective, including the\r\nspecial needs of women and girls. It also invited the\r\nSecurity Council to carry out a study and to report to it\r\non the impact of armed conflict on women and girls,\r\nthe role of women in peace-building and the gender\r\ndimension of peace processes and conflict resolution.\r\nThe Council still has a lot of work to do in this regard.\r\nThirdly, in response to the Security Council’s\r\nrequest, contained in its presidential statement of 20\r\nJuly 2000 (S/PRST/2000/25), the Secretary-General\r\nissued his report on conflict prevention (A/55/985) to\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly. This\r\nreport contained specific recommendations on how the\r\nefforts of the United Nations could be further enhanced\r\nin this area. Next month, during Jamaica’s presidency\r\nof the Council, the Secretary-General will report on the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict and the steps\r\ntaken to advance the role of the Security Council in\r\nprotecting civilians in situations of armed conflict.\r\nThe Security Council, having highlighted the\r\nrelationship of these thematic issues to peace and\r\nsecurity, must now ensure that the conclusions of these\r\ndebates are mainstreamed into Security Council actions\r\nin specific conflict situations.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nIn the wake of the report (A/55/305) of the Panel\r\non United Nations Peace Operations, the Brahimi\r\nreport, and the recommendations contained therein to\r\nimprove United Nations peacekeeping operations, the\r\nCouncil has taken concrete steps to implement those\r\nrecommendations which fall within its purview. The\r\nCouncil adopted resolution 1327 (2000) of 13\r\nNovember 2000, on the recommendation of its ad hoc\r\nWorking Group, establishing for itself a doctrine for\r\nimproving peacekeeping operations and setting the\r\nfoundation for future initiatives aimed at advancing\r\nthis process.\r\nFollowing a series of open debates in the Council,\r\nwith the full participation of a significant number of\r\nMember States, on exit strategies, peace-building and\r\nrelations with troop-contributing countries, the Council\r\nestablished its Working Group on Peacekeeping\r\nOperations, charged with undertaking a review of\r\nSecurity Council peacekeeping in all its aspects. Thus\r\nfar, the Working Group has provided recommendations\r\nfor the Council, which were adopted in resolution 1353\r\n(2001) of 13 June 2001 and which, inter alia, provided\r\nmodalities for increased consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing countries, thereby enhancing the input of\r\ntheir views in the decision-making process of the\r\nCouncil. The Council is implementing these new\r\nprocedures, including the holding of private meetings\r\nwith troop-contributing countries. The Working Group\r\ncontinues to evaluate this relationship and is expected\r\nto make further recommendations in the near future.\r\nThe Working Group has also provided the\r\nCouncil with a new doctrine for exit strategies for\r\npeacekeeping operations. This was set out in a note by\r\nthe President on 25 September 2001.\r\nI would like to add to these initiatives a number\r\nof other innovations that have had a positive impact on\r\nthe work of the Council, such as the holding of private\r\nmeetings with regional and subregional groups and\r\nMember States — for example, the meetings with the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the Lusaka Political Committee — and\r\nwith individuals, such as former Presidents Nelson\r\nMandela and Sir Ketumile Masire, Facilitators of the\r\nArusha peace process on Burundi and the Inter-\r\nCongolese Dialogue of the Lusaka peace process on the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, respectively.\r\nFurther, more frequent use of Arria formula meetings,\r\nto hear the views of non-governmental organizations\r\nand others, has contributed considerably to the\r\ninformation base of the Council.\r\nThe Security Council has also given full support\r\nto the Secretariat in building its capacity to provide the\r\nCouncil and other organs of the United Nations with\r\nthe best possible information and analyses for use in\r\nthe decision-making process in strengthening United\r\nNations peace operations. These and other\r\nundertakings by the Council augur well for the future\r\nof our Organization. We must continue to build on\r\nthem. However, at the same time we must continue to\r\nwork for a more representative Security Council, and\r\nwe must help achieve further proficiency in its working\r\nmethods and procedures.\r\nThis report of the Security Council provides a\r\nvery broad perspective of the Council\u0027s work during the\r\nreporting period. Member States, while expressing\r\nsome satisfaction with the depth of information\r\nprovided, have also found the analyses of issues falling\r\nshort of expectations. My delegation welcomes the\r\nsuggestions made by Member States in this regard and\r\nsupports the view that there is room for improvement.\r\nDuring the remainder of our term on the Council,\r\nJamaica will continue to work towards the\r\nimprovement of the contents of the report and will\r\nparticipate fully in the review of the report to be\r\nundertaken in the Council.\r\nLet me conclude by congratulating those Member\r\nStates that have been elected to a term on the Security\r\nCouncil beginning on 1 January 2002: Bulgaria,\r\nCameroon, Guinea, Mexico and Syria. The task ahead\r\nfor the Council and the United Nations does not end\r\nwith the progress we have made, but, rather, depends\r\non us showing the necessary political will to advance\r\ninternational peace and security. Much is expected of\r\nus. The eyes of the world are on us.\r\nMr. Vento (Italy): The tragic terrorist attacks of\r\n11 September have dramatically accelerated the\r\nprocess of deep and lasting change in the role of the\r\nUnited Nations. They have reaffirmed its centrality as\r\nthe preferred forum for dialogue among States and the\r\npromotion of universally shared values and rules. Over\r\na one-month period we have witnessed an incredible\r\nseries of events. The full unity of intent among\r\nmembers of the General Assembly and of the Security\r\nCouncil has allowed the adoption of unprecedented,\r\nfar-reaching measures against the scourge of terrorism.\r\nWe trust that they will be implemented objectively and\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\ncollegially, in a way that strengthens the credibility of\r\nthe United Nations and its organs.\r\nThen, on Friday, the Nobel Peace Prize was\r\nawarded jointly to the Organization and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, recognizing the commitment of the United\r\nNations and the leadership of Mr. Kofi Annan. This\r\nrecognition invites all of us to increase our efforts to\r\nmake the action of the United Nations more and more\r\neffective in meeting new global challenges.\r\nToday the members of the General Assembly are\r\ncalled upon to assess the work of the Security Council\r\nin the crucial field of peace and security. This creates a\r\nrare opportunity for dialogue and interaction between\r\nthe main organs, pursuant to Article 15 of the Charter.\r\nWe hope that the debate can shed the rituals that have\r\ncharacterized it in the past and lead, instead, to\r\nspecific, constructive proposals to bring to the attention\r\nof Security Council members.\r\nTo achieve this purpose, the format and contents\r\nof the Securi1y Council\u0027s annual report should be\r\nrevised. Such a costly but — let’s face it — inadequate\r\ndocument does not allow the General Assembly to\r\nmake an assessment of the Council\u0027s performance. We\r\nthus share the proposals formulated in this regard by\r\nnon-permanent members, such as Singapore and\r\nColombia, who are striving to make the reports\r\ncontents more substantial and analytical. If the\r\nAssembly is to measure and monitor the impact of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s decisions and results, then we should know\r\nnot so much the quantity of the Council\u0027s action as the\r\nquality.\r\nThe real business of the Security Council gets\r\ndone in the informal consultations. But the Council’s\r\ndecisions are the business of all Member States. Apart\r\nfrom the fact that they are mandatory and involve\r\nconsiderable financial burdens, they affect an\r\nincreasing number of areas. The broader notion of\r\ninternational security has grown across the boundaries\r\nto include topics that used to be treated either at the\r\nnational level or, in the international context, through\r\ntraditional instruments of cooperation. Today the\r\nSecurity Council’s competences extend from the\r\nmultifaceted campaign against terrorism to the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases; from the\r\nprotection of women, children and civilians in armed\r\nconflicts to the safeguarding of refugees. Having said\r\nall this, it is self-evident that such decisions deserve —\r\nindeed demand — the maximum possible transparency,\r\nexactly the opposite of what is obtained through\r\nrecourse to informal consultations.\r\nWe must lift the veil that covers the Security\r\nCouncil’s working methods and sometimes makes its\r\ndecisions so controversial. This is a prerequisite if we\r\nwish such important deliberations to be truly shared\r\nand embraced by all. We cannot allow doubts to be\r\nnurtured about a Security Council that initiates more\r\nand more complex peacekeeping missions, undertakes\r\nfact-finding missions to crisis areas, imposes targeted\r\nsanctions regimes, appoints expert panels and\r\nestablishes mechanisms to monitor their application.\r\nAll United Nations Members share the responsibility\r\nfor financing peacekeeping operations, whose cost\r\namounts to approximately $3 billion per year, well in\r\nexcess of the regular budget, which has remained stable\r\nat $1.1 billion per year. Therefore, we must promote\r\ngreater accountability on the part of the Council and\r\ngreater openness to the contributions of non-members\r\nin order to make its decisions — all too often\r\ninadequately implemented — more representative and\r\neffective.\r\nWhile, in the past, its action was often\r\nconditioned and paralysed by the threat of intersecting\r\nvetoes, the Security Council now intervenes more and\r\nmore often in the main regional crises. In the past year\r\nalone, it has maintained its massive commitment to\r\npeacekeeping missions in the Balkans, the Middle East\r\nand East Timor. In the Balkans, Italy makes a large\r\ncontribution to both the United Nations system and to\r\nother international organizations.\r\nWe are pleased that efforts to stabilize African\r\ncrises have continued with the starting up of the United\r\nNations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, preparations\r\nfor the third phase of the United Nations Organization\r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nprogress in the deployment of the United Nations\r\nMission in Sierra Leone. However, we would have\r\nappreciated finding more indications in the report on\r\nprospects for greater commitments by the Security\r\nCouncil in bringing stability to Africa through timely\r\npeace-building measures.\r\nCooperation with the main troop-contributing\r\ncountries has also made progress, but this partnership\r\nmust be strengthened and made more meaningful,\r\nespecially during the decision-making stage when\r\npeacekeeping missions are launched or their mandates\r\nsubstantially revised. We look forward to our\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nNovember appointment for the introduction of further\r\nimprovements, borrowing from practices that have\r\ndeveloped recently, as requested in resolution 1353\r\n(2001) of 13 June 2001.\r\nIn the past year, the Security Council has devoted\r\nspecial attention to improving its decision-making\r\nprocesses. Spurred by the recommendations contained\r\nin the Brahimi report and incorporating some of the\r\nproposals formulated by the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform, the Council has\r\nstarted with renewed energy to address conflict\r\nprevention, the definition of credible mandates during\r\ncrisis management, exit strategies and the transition to\r\npeace-building through a more structured dialogue with\r\nUnited Nations agencies, funds and programmes. To\r\nthat end, we urge the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General to take full advantage of the range of\r\ninstruments provided for by the Charter, particularly\r\nunder Chapter VI, and to make the liaison with the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil more operational and effective.\r\nA promising area where the Security Council\r\ncould strengthen its action is the improvement of\r\nrelations with regional organizations, which are often\r\nequipped with sufficient will for action and varied\r\nmeans of intervention to quickly and effectively deal\r\nwith situations of instability that closely affect their\r\nmembers. In this sense, collaboration between the\r\nSecurity Council and the European Union, as well as\r\nwith the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope, the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States, has\r\nintensified in recent years, both at the operative level\r\nand in the decision-making bodies, as attested to by the\r\nfourth high-level meeting promoted last February by\r\nthe Secretary-General, as well as by the statement to\r\nthe Security Council by Javier Solana, the European\r\nUnion High Representative for Common Foreign and\r\nSecurity Policy.\r\nItaly believes that the development of crisis-\r\nmanagement capability in the European Union\r\nrepresents a substantial added value for rapid\r\ndeployment capability and, in general, for the\r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations conducted\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations. Consequently,\r\nwe intend to work to further develop European Union/\r\nUnited Nations cooperation in conflict prevention and\r\ncrisis management.\r\nIn the changing international context, the United\r\nNations is in the front line as the forum for global\r\ngovernance. We must therefore continue to review the\r\nworkings of the organ established to maintain peace\r\nand security in the world. To that end, Italy will carry\r\non its commitment to the process of Security Council\r\nreform. By building on past progress, we can achieve\r\ncomprehensive reform in all its aspects, thereby\r\nfulfilling the commitment undersigned by the heads of\r\nState and Government in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): At the\r\noutset, I wish to express the gratitude of my delegation\r\nto the President of the Security Council, Ambassador\r\nRichard Ryan of Ireland, for submitting the Council’s\r\nannual report to the General Assembly, in accordance\r\nwith Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter.\r\nMy country attaches particular importance to the\r\nitem under consideration, as it provides the occasion\r\nfor interaction between those two main organs of the\r\nUnited Nations and a useful opportunity for States\r\nMembers to assess and embark on substantive\r\ndialogue. In recent years, we have joined our voice to\r\nthose calling for an effort to be made to improve the\r\nquality of the report. We have to acknowledge today\r\nthat we are concerned to have noted no success in that\r\ntask.\r\nThe report before us today is a mere compilation\r\nof papers providing a documentation of the Council’s\r\nactivities. No genuine effort has been made to have it\r\ninform the Assembly about the considerations and\r\nassessments undertaken by the Council on various\r\nsubjects before it during the reporting period; instead,\r\nit simply reproduces resolutions that are already known\r\nand distributed. Such a format hampers understanding\r\nand judgement of the Council’s arguments and motives\r\nin approving them. In truth, this report is designed not\r\nto establish dialogue, but to provide a reference\r\narchive. The greatest drawback of this format is that it\r\ndoes not direct the participatory understanding of the\r\nAssembly, but merely fulfils a formality, which\r\nnecessarily provokes a sceptical reaction.\r\nOne way to remedy this situation would be to\r\nincrease the number of meetings open to all Members.\r\nWe have often stated the need to have more such\r\nmeetings. These should not be confined to subjects of\r\ngeneral importance on which reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral are requested and analysed, as has been done\r\nin the past. The non-member States should be able to\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\ncontribute and present their position on issues under\r\nconsideration that will later be the subject of\r\nresolutions that are binding on all Members.\r\nWith this, we in no way seek to undermine the\r\nCharter powers and prerogatives of the Security\r\nCouncil, particularly with regard to the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process. We seek to create an\r\nopportunity to listen to and hear the opinions of those\r\nto whom the implementation and financing of the\r\nCouncil’s decisions will fall. The Council is mistaken\r\nin preventing that.\r\nWe cannot fail to note the responsibility of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in this matter. We must say quite\r\nfrankly that we have been unable to implement existing\r\nagreements that are directly linked to the Security\r\nCouncil’s report. In the process of improving the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s methods of work, that organ has\r\nadopted various resolutions, inter alia, resolution\r\n51/241, “Strengthening of the United Nations system”,\r\nin which various tasks are assigned to the Assembly,\r\nthe implementation of which required the necessary\r\npolitical will. The principal task here is an assessment\r\nby the President of the Assembly of the debate on the\r\nitem, on the basis of which he can designate one of the\r\nVice-Presidents to conduct consultations on any\r\nadditional action that might be deemed necessary.\r\nSince the adoption of that resolution five years ago, no\r\nsuch assessment has been made. We would certainly\r\nwish this to be done now.\r\nLet me also stress once again the importance of\r\nSecurity Council action. The two resolutions adopted\r\nin the wake of the 11 September tragedy are of\r\nenormous relevance to international peace and security,\r\nand my delegation supports them without reservation.\r\nThe urgency of the subject has once more led the\r\nCouncil to take the option of formulating international\r\nlaw with very complex implications. This must be the\r\nobject of careful study with the participation of the\r\nentire membership. That is all the more necessary with\r\nrespect to the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\r\nChile underscores the need for a broad approach\r\nto conflict prevention and peace-building. This requires\r\nvery close cooperation among the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council\r\nand other bodies concerned with development.\r\nCooperation between the Security Council and the\r\nUnited Nations bodies with responsibility in vital areas\r\nsuch as poverty reduction, development assistance,\r\nhuman rights and the environment is crucial if we are\r\nto address the root causes of conflict.\r\nOwing to fundamental changes in the\r\ninternational security situation, peacekeeping\r\noperations are facing new challenges and\r\ncomplications. The credibility of the United Nations in\r\nthe new millennium may depend on such factors as its\r\neffectiveness in meeting its peacekeeping\r\nresponsibilities. We therefore consider it important to\r\nmake effective use of established mechanisms to\r\nfacilitate consultations between Council members and\r\ncountries that contribute troops to peacekeeping\r\noperations. All nations that provide contingents,\r\nincluding those that provide civilian personnel for\r\nmulti-function operations, have a legitimate wish —\r\nand an absolute need — to be consulted when the\r\nrelevant operations are being discussed, so that they\r\nwill be able to make a genuine, not a merely\r\ntheoretical, contribution to the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nChile welcomes the fact that the world\r\ncommunity is increasingly turning to the United\r\nNations to resolve conflicts. Collective international\r\nsecurity is founded on the commitment of Member\r\nStates to multilateral cooperation.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Security Council\r\nfocused its attention principally on conflicts in Africa,\r\nbut it did not neglect other important issues elsewhere.\r\nWe followed with interest and satisfaction the outcome\r\nof the Council mission to the Great Lakes region and\r\nthe progress the Council made in understanding the\r\nroot causes of the conflict there, along with the\r\ngeopolitical importance of resolving the problems of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nWe are aware of, and we appreciate, the help and\r\nthe constant guidance the Council has been providing\r\nto the people of East Timor throughout its\r\nindependence process — which has not been entirely\r\nfree of difficulties. The Council has also addressed,\r\nwith commitment, items such as the prevention of\r\narmed conflict, small arms, children in armed conflict,\r\nthe protection of civilians in armed conflict and women\r\nand peace, among other important issues, all of which\r\nhave implications for international peace and security.\r\nOur common goal is to increase the effectiveness\r\nand transparency of the Security Council as it carries\r\nout the primary responsibility entrusted to it by the\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\nMembers of the Organization. We know, however, that,\r\nbecause of the nature of that goal and the diversity of\r\nviews and interests, that will be no easy task. But it is\r\nnot an impossible one. I assure the Assembly that my\r\ncountry will lend its enthusiastic support with respect\r\nto all that may be required of it to bring about a\r\nbroader, more flexible dialogue, for the sake of a more\r\npromising future for the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation concludes by congratulating the\r\ndelegations of Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico\r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic on their election to\r\nmembership of the Security Council; we wish them\r\nevery success during their term of office.\r\nMr. Koonjul (Mauritius): First of all, allow me to\r\nthank the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Richard Ryan, for introducing the report\r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-sixth session (A/56/2). Let me also say that my\r\ndelegation fully subscribes to the statements made by\r\nthe representatives of Colombia and of Singapore. One\r\nmay legitimately ask why several elected members of\r\nthe Security Council are being so critical of a report\r\nemanating from a body of which they have been\r\nmembers for several months. Many delegations may\r\neven say that Council members should collectively\r\nbear responsibility for the report which, as a matter of\r\nfact, was adopted by the Council on 18 September\r\n2001. As members of the Council elected by this body,\r\nthe General Assembly, in accordance with Article 23 of\r\nthe Charter, we believe that we owe accountability to\r\nthe General Assembly for the actions we take in the\r\nCouncil. Furthermore, as has been pointed out by\r\nseveral delegations, the report has many shortcomings,\r\nand it is important that we recognize these\r\nshortcomings so that future reports can be improved\r\nboth in format and in content.\r\nAccording to its introduction, “the report is\r\nintended as a guide to the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil during the period covered” (A/56/2, p. 1). My\r\ndelegation believes that a clear distinction has to be\r\nmade between a guide and a report coming from the\r\nSecurity Council. If what is intended is indeed a report\r\nas required under Article 15 of the Charter, then it is\r\nclear from our debate today that a new approach has to\r\nbe devised to communicate to the general membership,\r\nin a substantive and analytical manner, the\r\ndeliberations of the Council during the reporting\r\nperiod. The report, which is a mere repertoire of\r\ndocuments previously issued by the Security Council,\r\ndoes not at all meet its intended purpose.\r\nAs mentioned by several delegations, the General\r\nAssembly needs a concise, analytical and reader-\r\nfriendly report on the issues that the Security Council\r\ndiscussed during the reporting period. Such a report\r\nshould fully assess the progress achieved on specific\r\nissues and should highlight those areas of difficulty\r\nwhich have held back progress in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. By submitting such a report, the\r\nSecurity Council would be able to obtain support and\r\nunderstanding from the broader membership, and that\r\nwould in turn help the Council in dealing with those\r\nissues in a more effective manner.\r\nI am not making any new proposal. As a matter of\r\nfact, the same suggestion has been made over the past\r\nyears by a majority of delegations addressing this\r\nissue. It is about time that the wish of the general\r\nmembership were translated into action. It would be\r\nmost unproductive if we were to discuss this issue\r\nagain in the same manner at the next session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAs regards working methods, my delegation is\r\nhappy to note that the work of the Security Council is\r\nbecoming more and more transparent. There has been a\r\nsubstantial increase in the number of public meetings\r\nwhere the general membership has been able to share\r\nits views on a number of topics with the Security\r\nCouncil. The press statements and the briefings to the\r\npress and to non-members of the Security Council after\r\ninformal consultations provide, on a regular basis,\r\ninformation on issues discussed privately in the\r\nCouncil and are most welcome. There is, however, an\r\nurgent need to find ways and means of involving,\r\nwhere appropriate, the larger membership of the United\r\nNations in the work of the Council.\r\nAs a representative of the African continent on\r\nthe Security Council, I wish to express my satisfaction\r\nat the particular interest the Security Council has\r\nshown in peace and security on the African continent.\r\nIndeed, the Security Council has devoted a very large\r\npart of its deliberations to African problems. We recall\r\nthe holding of the Security Council summit on the topic\r\n“Ensuring an effective role of the Security Council in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nparticularly in Africa” in September last year. During\r\nthat meeting our leaders reaffirmed their determination\r\nto give special attention to the promotion of durable\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.26\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa and\r\nrecognized the specific characteristics of African\r\nconflicts. They also renewed their readiness to resolve\r\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nand those in the Great Lakes region. They stressed the\r\ncritical importance of the disarmament, demobilization\r\nand reintegration of ex-combatants and emphasized\r\nthat such a programme should be integrated into the\r\nmandates of peacekeeping operations.\r\nAfter such a high-level meeting, one would have\r\nthought that concrete and effective follow-up actions\r\nwould have been taken to resolve some of these\r\nchronic problems. Unfortunately, such is not the case.\r\nThe African continent continues to be riddled\r\nwith numerous conflicts. One may pertinently ask why\r\nthis is so. Very often African countries that are facing\r\nproblems do not find what is commonly labelled a\r\n“lead nation” to take initiatives to resolve inter-State or\r\nintra-State conflicts. This is particularly so when\r\nseveral countries in the region also get involved in the\r\nconflicts. In the few instances where we get very able\r\nand talented negotiators and facilitators, we find that\r\nthe Security Council not only limits its role to\r\nencouraging and supporting the actions and efforts of\r\nthese facilitators but also shows tremendous hesitation\r\nin responding to their calls for concrete action. The\r\nSecurity Council, therefore, should be urged to take a\r\nmore proactive and direct role in the resolution of\r\nconflicts. In this regard, the efforts of regional\r\norganizations should be seen as complementary to\r\nUnited Nations initiatives.\r\nThe role of the Security Council in post-conflict\r\npeace-building is also of extreme importance. There is\r\na sentiment that once a conflict has ended the Security\r\nCouncil’s engagement is over. But in many instances\r\nthe situation after a conflict is extremely vulnerable\r\nand in many cases reversible. In view of the fragile\r\npolitical situation that emerges out of conflict\r\nresolution, it is essential to focus on confidence-\r\nbuilding measures and on the strengthening of\r\ndemocratic institutions. It is only when democratic\r\nvalues are fully entrenched in these institutions that we\r\ncan have sustainable peace.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation would wish to\r\nunderscore the importance of consultations and\r\nharmonization among the various organs of the United\r\nNations, in particular between the Security Council and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council. While the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security comes\r\nunder the competence of the Security Council, we\r\nshould not overlook the fact that the process of\r\nsustainable peace-building requires the direct\r\ninvolvement of the Economic and Social Council and\r\nother United Nations bodies. Conflict resolution and\r\npeacekeeping are not ends in themselves. The welfare\r\nand prosperity of the people in a peaceful environment\r\nshould be the ultimate goal. Peace-building is probably\r\nthe most vital aspect of a peace process, and adequate\r\nattention has to be paid to it.\r\nWe wish to echo the disappointment of\r\nAmbassador Baali of Algeria and of several other\r\nmembers at the missed opportunity that resulted from\r\nthe inability of the Security Council and the Economic\r\nand Social Council to have a joint meeting last May.\r\nThis is all the more frustrating since Article 65 of our\r\nCharter clearly provides for such avenues of\r\ncooperation.\r\nThere are also certain critical issues of direct\r\nrelevance to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity that continue to remain taboos in the Security\r\nCouncil. It is important that the Council assume its full\r\nresponsibility as the custodian of peace and security\r\nand address such issues in a more concrete and\r\neffective manner.\r\nClearly, this debate today has been extremely\r\nuseful. By and large, the majority of the speakers have\r\ncalled for much-needed improvement, not only in the\r\nworking methods of the Council, but also in the\r\npresentation of its report. In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolutions 51/193 and 51/241, it is the duty\r\nof the General Assembly to communicate to the\r\nSecurity Council its views and comments on the report\r\nof the Security Council. We look forward to this\r\ncommunication, which will provide the basis for\r\ndeliberations within the Security Council and will help\r\nimprove the Council’s working methods and its reports\r\nin the future.\r\nAs an elected Member, Mauritius will continue to\r\nwork towards a more transparent Security Council,\r\nwhich will benefit the broader membership of the\r\nUnited Nations, and for a more result-oriented, more\r\nanalytical and self-critical report in the future.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.\r\n"
