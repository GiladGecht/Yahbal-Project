"United Nations A/56/PV.27\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nFifty-sixth session\r\n27th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 16 October 2001, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-178. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n01-58132 (E)\r\n*0158132*\r\nPresident: Mr. Han Seung-soo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Republic of Korea)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Sharma\r\n(Nepal), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to remind\r\nmembers to make sure that at least one member of each\r\ndelegation is in the General Assembly Hall by 10 a.m.\r\nsharp so that we can proceed with our very important\r\nmeetings right on time, without losing our valuable\r\ntime and opportunity. I thank members for their kind\r\ncooperation, and I hope that we will be able to meet on\r\ntime, as the President has always insisted on doing. It\r\nis our own time, and it is to our own credit to meet as\r\nscheduled.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/56/2)\r\nMr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation would like at the outset to thank the\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober, the Ambassador and Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Ireland, Mr. Richard Ryan, for his\r\nexhaustive presentation of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil, which is submitted to the General Assembly\r\nunder the provisions of the Charter. Tunisia would also\r\nlike to take this opportunity to congratulate once again\r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic, Guinea, Cameroon, Mexico\r\nand Bulgaria on their election as non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. We are certain that\r\nthese countries will not fail to contribute constructively\r\nto the work of the Council. Allow me also to\r\ncongratulate us all on the Nobel Peace Prize that was\r\nawarded this year to our Organization and the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nThe examination of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil has always been the main mechanism at the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s disposal, under the provisions of\r\nthe Charter, to assess the activity of the Security\r\nCouncil throughout the period covered in the report.\r\nThis mechanism also enables the General Assembly to\r\nidentify the measures that should be taken in order to\r\nmake the necessary improvements to the working\r\nmethods of that body in a way that faithfully follows\r\nthe letter and the spirit of the Charter and also meets\r\nthe expectations of the Member States of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe annual debate on the report is also an\r\nopportunity of which I think the Security Council\r\nshould fully avail itself, by making concrete use of the\r\ninnovative and constructive ideas that emerge in the\r\ncourse of this debate in order to enhance its\r\neffectiveness and credibility and to lend tangible form\r\nto its interaction with the General Assembly.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation takes note of the\r\nsustained efforts of the Council to improve its\r\nperformance in carrying out its mandate in the field of\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThis trend, which we support and encourage, consists\r\nin the following points.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nThe first is the enshrinement of the broadened\r\nconcept of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, which now goes beyond traditional\r\npeacekeeping operations to include conflict prevention\r\nand peace-building. This approach is expressed in\r\nseveral presidential statements and resolutions of the\r\nCouncil that contain measures and specific\r\nrecommendations to this end. Our Organization should\r\nfrom now on think in terms of prevention to head off\r\nconflict and spare human lives, not to mention the\r\nfinancial aspects. The Council shows a trend to hold\r\nbrainstorming sessions, which can improve the work of\r\nprevention. This is certainly a step forward.\r\nSecond is effective cooperation with all of the\r\nconcerned parties — those who are part of the United\r\nNations family as well as those outside this system, in\r\nparticular regional organizations. We welcome and\r\nencourage this approach.\r\nThird is more effective concentration on the\r\nconflicts in Africa and broadening the scope of their\r\nconsideration by covering the general geopolitical\r\nframework of a given conflict rather than focusing\r\nattention exclusively on the country involved in\r\nconflict. This approach has been demonstrated\r\nspecifically in the way the Council approached the\r\nsituation in the countries of West Africa.\r\nFourth is the improvement in the concept of the\r\nsanctions regime so as to ensure that the goals at which\r\nthe sanctions are aimed are obtained, while not\r\nharming the interests of third States and the\r\npopulations of the countries hit by the sanctions. This\r\ntendency has been widely established in the sanctions\r\nregimes imposed on Ethiopia, Eritrea and Liberia, but\r\nnot yet in respect of other countries; I shall return to\r\nthis question.\r\nThe conclusion we have reached in reviewing this\r\npositive evolution is that the Security Council has\r\neffectively shown its capacity and its readiness —\r\nprovided that it has the necessary political will — to\r\nreact favourably and concretely to the ideas expressed\r\nby Member States of the Organization, which are\r\ncapable of further enhancing its credibility.\r\nWe think that that constructive trend should be\r\nencouraged and promoted to ensure that the Security\r\nCouncil can play its central role of tackling all\r\ninternational peace and security matters on an equal\r\nfooting. In that regard, my delegation would like to\r\nmake the following points.\r\nFirst, the Security Council must devote the\r\nnecessary attention to the situation in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, including Jerusalem. The\r\nCouncil’s responsibility remains vital; there is no\r\nalternative to it.\r\nSecondly, my delegation also believes that the\r\nSecurity Council’s primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security\r\nrequires it to deal properly with the issue of Somalia,\r\nwhich remains practically absent from the Council’s\r\nagenda, despite the obvious dangers posed by the\r\ncontinued lack of basic State structures in Somalia. Let\r\nus not forget that the Council’s inappropriate handling\r\nof the situation in Afghanistan has led to that hitherto\r\nalmost forgotten conflict taking on uncontrollable\r\ninternational dimensions and giving rise to a new type\r\nof political turmoil that requires a new approach by the\r\nSecurity Council to all hotbeds of tension, as well as\r\nnew methods to deal with them.\r\nThirdly, on the issue of sanctions, my\r\ndelegation — like many other delegations — regrets\r\nthat the Security Council did not adopt the\r\nrecommendations of the Working Group it established\r\nto deal with this issue. My delegation underscores once\r\nagain the need for the Council to agree on the measures\r\nnecessary for harmonizing sanctions regimes by\r\nestablishing general rules identifying the criteria for\r\nthe lifting of sanctions; specifying mechanisms the\r\nCouncil can use to assess the degree of implementation\r\nof the objectives intended to be attained by the\r\nsanctions; establishing time limits for sanctions and\r\ndefining specific criteria for the renewal of sanctions;\r\nactivating the provisions of Article 50 of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations; and, lastly, putting in place\r\nappropriate measures to prevent negative effects of\r\nsanctions from affecting civilian populations.\r\nWith regard to the Council’s working methods,\r\nwe noted with satisfaction the growing improvement in\r\nthis regard, which has made the Council’s work more\r\ntransparent. That improvement can be clearly seen in\r\nthe growing number of open meetings held by the\r\nCouncil, as well as in the closed meetings held\r\npursuant to Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter. This\r\nimprovement can also be seen in the strengthening of\r\ncooperation between the Council and troop-\r\ncontributing countries, in the adoption of resolution\r\n1353 (2001) of 13 June 2001, and in the private\r\nmeetings held between the Council and troop-\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\ncontributing countries in accordance with this\r\nresolution.\r\nWe have also noted a desire by the Council to\r\nimprove its understanding of the situations it deals with\r\nby sending special missions to the field and by carrying\r\nout direct dialogues at the highest level with parties to\r\nconflicts. These measures have had a positive impact\r\non the substance of the Council’s decisions, which now\r\nrespond better to the demands of the situations under\r\nits consideration.\r\nThe Security Council has also made sure that it\r\nkeeps Member States informed through briefings given\r\nby Presidents about informal consultations.\r\nMoreover, we have noted that some members of\r\nthe Council have recently begun a trend whereby open\r\nmeetings are held at the end of their presidency to\r\nassess the work of the Council. We note this new trend\r\nwith satisfaction, because we believe that it contributes\r\nto greater transparency. We also believe that it is\r\npossible to further develop that practice so as to ensure\r\nwe have a true mechanism for interaction between the\r\nCouncil and the other Member States of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe have also not failed to notice the Council’s\r\nefforts to strengthen interaction with the General\r\nAssembly by delegating some of its members to\r\nparticipate in the deliberations of the General\r\nAssembly Working Group dealing with the issue of\r\nSecurity Council reform. Given the Council’s evolving\r\nand essential role on the international scene, we think\r\nthat this practice also needs to be further developed and\r\ninstitutionalized, as it can be beneficial to Council\r\nreform and to enhancing its effectiveness, transparency\r\nand credibility.\r\nReforming the Security Council’s working\r\nmethods is not an end in itself. The ultimate goal of\r\nthat reform is to strengthen the Council’s capacity to\r\nproperly carry out its responsibilities, given that all its\r\ndecisions have direct and immediate effect not only on\r\nMember States, but also on individuals in every region\r\nof the world. The sole purpose of the interaction\r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly that we\r\nare calling for is to ensure that the Council fulfils the\r\nhopes and aspirations of the international community\r\nand firmly establishes the foundations of an\r\ninternational legality that binds us all and to which all\r\nof us can turn in times of both war and peace.\r\nWe have all taken note of the Council’s initiatives\r\nin that regard, and of its willingness to improve its\r\nworking methods, including those concerned with the\r\ncontent and structure of its annual report to the General\r\nAssembly. In this context, we would like to highlight\r\nthe great importance we attach to the work of the\r\nSecurity Council Working Group on Documentation\r\nand Procedures. We would like to take this opportunity\r\nto call on the Group to take into account the views\r\nexpressed by Member States in this debate, as well as\r\nthe ideas expressed in the General Assembly’s Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform.\r\nWe have no intention of repeating yet again the\r\ncriticisms made during this debate with regard to the\r\nformat and contents of the Council’s annual report,\r\nwhich, despite the importance given to it in the Charter,\r\ndoes not meet its intended objective of providing\r\nMember States with the information necessary to\r\nevaluate the Council’s work. Criticism in that regard\r\nhas already been made, and we are not going to repeat\r\nit. Those shortcomings must be rectified.\r\nWorthwhile efforts have been made in recent\r\nmonths to deal with problems in order to strengthen our\r\ntrust in the Council. Various ideas have been\r\nmentioned, such as transparency, which cannot be\r\navoided in today’s world, but also new notions, such as\r\naccountability and follow-up with regard to\r\nimplementation of the Council’s decisions. Those\r\nefforts should be encouraged, because they will give\r\nour Organization greater authority and credibility —\r\nand, indeed, a greater degree of democracy. I very\r\nmuch hope that when we next consider this item we\r\nshall have encouraging answers.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to refer to the fact that\r\nAmbassador Ryan, in introducing the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, emphasized that the members of the\r\nSecurity Council will consider all suggestions made\r\nduring this debate. I reaffirm my country’s commitment\r\nto work during the remainder of our term as a non-\r\npermanent member of the Council to promote the\r\nconstructive ideas that emerge from today’s debate. My\r\ndelegation looks forward to coordinating its efforts in\r\nthis area with the other members of the Security\r\nCouncil as well as with the rest of the membership of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nMr. Alcalay (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\njoin earlier speakers in congratulating the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nwhich also went to the United Nations Organization\r\nitself. The award is an encouragement for us to\r\ncontinue to work to build a world of peace and security,\r\nparticularly at this time when the impact of the terrorist\r\nacts of 11 September have generated such immediate\r\nsolidarity in the international community in the\r\nstruggle against the scourge of terrorism. In this\r\ncontext, we would like to express our sincere gratitude\r\nto the Security Council for its very swift response on\r\nthe morning of 12 September, followed by the General\r\nAssembly the same day, with the unanimous adoption\r\nof a resolution by each body.\r\n Venezuela considers the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to be extremely important, not only because\r\nthe Council is a main organ of the United Nations, but\r\nbecause of the high expectations that have arisen in\r\nconnection with the proposed changes aimed at\r\nensuring a more analytical approach, which would\r\ncertainly help to improve the content of the report.\r\nThe delegation of Venezuela thanks the\r\nSecretariat for its preparation of the most recent report,\r\nwhich details the Security Council’s work over the past\r\nyear in a comprehensive and in-depth way; a great\r\neffort has been made in this respect.\r\nMy delegation, however, would like to share\r\nsome thoughts on the content of the report as they\r\nrelate to two areas.\r\nFirst, with regard to the content itself, the great\r\ndeal of space devoted to discussions in the Council on\r\nitems such as Africa, the Middle East, the question of\r\nPalestine, East Timor, Iraq and the Balkans shows the\r\ncontinued importance of such issues.\r\nAnother significant aspect is reform of the\r\nCouncil. The report shows that there is a continuing\r\ntendency for meetings to take place behind closed\r\ndoors, which my delegation believes runs counter to\r\nthe need to adopt democratic and transparent working\r\nmethods. That need flows from the demands of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, together with reaffirmation of\r\nthe right of all States to participate, members and non-\r\nmembers of the Security Council alike.\r\nAs for the Council’s agenda, other important\r\nissues — including those of children and armed\r\nconflict; HIV/AIDS and peacekeeping operations; and\r\nwomen, peace and security — have become\r\nincreasingly relevant. The Council, however, should\r\nconsider such items in connection with their\r\nimplications for its particular area of competence,\r\nnamely, international peace and security.\r\nThe other area on which we would like to\r\ncomment relates specifically to methodology, in\r\nparticular the way in which information is handled and\r\npresented. My delegation would like to emphasize that,\r\ndespite the major effort that has been made in\r\npreparing the report, we have still not seen the results,\r\nor the more dynamic relationship, that we had hoped\r\nfor. This is particularly important given that today,\r\nmore than ever, we must continue to effect a change in\r\nthe international political, economic and social order so\r\nthat we can focus more closely on resolving the most\r\nserious problems, in accordance with the objectives set\r\nout during the Millennium Summit of heads of State or\r\nGovernment, which took place last year here in New\r\nYork.\r\nWe hope that the Security Council will in future\r\nbe able to prepare its reports in a more analytical and\r\nconstructive manner, so as to reflect the general\r\norientation of its work. That would enable us to form a\r\nprecise picture of its activities, and of its vision for the\r\nfuture, as they relate to the development of issues\r\nrelating to international peace and security and their\r\nbearing on the general situation in international\r\nrelations, which is the fundamental raison d’etre of our\r\ninternational Organization.\r\nWe are sure that considerable difficulties remain\r\nwith this analytical approach. Nonetheless, we are\r\naware that there is a desire to improve the preparation\r\nand presentation of the report, as evidenced by the\r\nwork of the Security Council Working Group on\r\nDocumentation and Procedures. We are sure that that\r\nwork will soon yield results.\r\nI would like to highlight the establishment of the\r\ncounter-terrorism Committee, established under\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). This will provide an\r\nopportunity for the Security Council not only to bring\r\nthe various countries of the United Nations together to\r\ncombat terrorism, but to ensure a positive, effective,\r\nopen and fluid interaction with all Member States with\r\na view to building peace in the world.\r\nIn conclusion, we congratulate the representatives\r\nof Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the Syrian\r\nArab Republic on their election as members of the\r\nSecurity Council. We are confident that their efforts\r\nwill contribute further to the work being undertaken by\r\nthe current members of the Council.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): I should like to\r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to Ambassador\r\nRichard Ryan, President of the Security Council for the\r\ncurrent month, for presenting the annual report on the\r\nwork of that organ for the period 16 June 2000 to 15\r\nJune 2001.\r\nLet me also congratulate the representatives of\r\nBulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and Syria on the\r\nrecent election of their countries to serve as non-\r\npermanent members of the Security Council starting on\r\n1 January 2002. My delegation would like to wish\r\nthese countries every success in discharging their very\r\nimportant responsibilities.\r\nIt is true that the record of the Council is always\r\nmixed; there are, of course, successes and there are\r\nfailures. The 12-month period covered in the report\r\nwas no exception to this rule, and the General\r\nAssembly’s evaluation of the work of the Council\r\nshould adequately acknowledge both.\r\nI cannot agree more with what was said yesterday\r\nby Ambassador Mahbubani of Singapore about the\r\nshift in political power within the United Nations\r\nfamily. Indeed, the sweeping changes on the world\r\npolitical scene of the last 10 years have led to the\r\nstrengthening and the expansion of the powers of the\r\nSecurity Council, thus making it — in contrast to the\r\nprevious decade — the most dominant and influential\r\nbody, whose activities effectively shape international\r\nrelations.\r\nThese changes have brought about increasing\r\ndemands from the international community for the\r\nreform of the Security Council. Ukraine remains\r\nrealistic about the fact that the comprehensive\r\ntransformation of the Council and its activities is not an\r\neasy endeavour. Slow progress in the working group of\r\nthe General Assembly on Security Council reform has\r\ndecreased our enthusiasm and expectations for quick\r\nresults. Still, the Council, conservative as it is, cannot\r\nstay away from the ongoing transformation processes\r\nof our Organization, and we have to admit that it is\r\ngradually — albeit not always consistently — changing\r\nthe way it acts. There is, I believe, growing\r\nrecognition, including within the Security Council, that\r\nreforms are indeed indispensable if the Council wants\r\nto respond to the demands of the times.\r\nDuring the period under review, the Council\r\neffectively continued applying to its work all the good\r\ntraditions and innovative approaches of past years, thus\r\nstrengthening and building on the trend towards greater\r\ntransparency and better working methods. This is\r\nespecially important in view of the close link between\r\nthe accountability and the transparency of the Council.\r\nWe note the increasing recourse to open meetings and\r\nthe growing participation of non-members of the\r\nCouncil in the consideration by the Security Council of\r\na large number of issues on its agenda. Of course,\r\nmuch remains to be done in this area, and we are still\r\nfar from the desired results. We have seen a number of\r\ninnovative proposals in this respect, and we hope that\r\nthe Council will constructively consider these\r\ninitiatives.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to offer\r\nmy delegation’s full support for the proposals put\r\nforward by Singapore to improve the contents and the\r\nformat of the Council’s annual reports. We look\r\nforward to the forthcoming discussions in the Council’s\r\nWorking Group on Documentation and Procedures and\r\nwe are ready to make Ukraine’s contribution to that\r\nconsideration.\r\nIt is important to recognize visible progress in the\r\narea of the reform of United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmechanisms. In the view of my delegation, close\r\ncooperation between troop-contributing countries, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat is one of the major\r\nfactors in conducting peacekeeping operations, at all\r\nstages, in the most effective manner. Against this\r\nbackground, we are satisfied with the real progress that\r\nwas achieved in this field last year following the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1327 (2000)\r\nand General Assembly resolution 55/135, both of\r\nwhich endorsed the recommendations of the Brahimi\r\nreport, as well as the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1353 (2001) this year.\r\nAt the same time, we agree that the new\r\narrangements formalized in these resolutions are far\r\nfrom being exhaustive. In this regard, we expect that\r\nmore will be done to find ways to improve the triangle\r\nof cooperation between the Secretariat, troop\r\ncontributors and the Security Council.\r\nIn recent years, issues related to sanctions became\r\nthe focus of attention of the international community\r\nand various United Nations organs. We note with\r\nsatisfaction the effective expansion of the United\r\nNations geography in consideration of various aspects\r\nof this issue, which continue to be addressed by an\r\nincreasing number of United Nations bodies. I have to\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nmention visible improvements in the Security Council\r\npolicy in this area in past years.\r\nSanctions, however, will and must remain a\r\nnecessary and important policy instrument in the hands\r\nof the Security Council. It is therefore of utmost\r\nimportance that the Council apply a clear and coherent\r\nmethodology for the imposition, application and lifting\r\nof measures under Chapter VII. In this connection, I\r\nwish to welcome the work done by the working group\r\nof the Security Council on general issues relating to\r\nsanctions, under the chairmanship of Ambassador\r\nChowdhury of Bangladesh, which successfully\r\nendeavoured to elaborate such a methodology. The\r\nadoption and the effective implementation of its results\r\nshould remain among the priorities of the Council’s\r\nactivities for the near future.\r\nI welcome the intensified dialogue with regional\r\nand subregional organizations. It is a promising\r\ndevelopment. Regional action could not only ease the\r\nburden of the Council, but could also contribute to a\r\ndeeper sense of general responsibility for the planet’s\r\npresent future, as well as to further democratization of\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nIn this context, we are satisfied that cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\r\nhas reached very high levels. In particular, we could\r\nrefer to the examples of such cooperation in resolving\r\nthe conflicts on the territory of the former Yugoslavia\r\nand in West Africa.\r\nThere are many other domains and dimensions\r\npressing for urgent change.\r\nThe tragic course of events in the Middle East in\r\nthe past year required the consistent attention of the\r\nCouncil. However, the effectiveness of the Council’s\r\nreaction to the situation was once again undermined by\r\nits inability to act and put a stop to the ongoing\r\nviolence and bloodshed in the Palestinian territory and\r\nin Israel and bring the parties back to the negotiating\r\ntable.\r\nThis May the Council started reviewing its policy\r\ntowards Iraq, trying to find a way out of the impasse,\r\nwhich characterizes the Council’s decade-long\r\nconsideration of this issue. We continue to believe that\r\nthe necessary preconditions for Iraqi cooperation with\r\nthe Council and the resolution of the Iraqi issue can\r\nand should be found outside the tightening of the\r\nsanctions regime, which has resulted in more than 10\r\nyears of suffering by the Iraqi people. We also\r\nemphasize that continuation of the dialogue between\r\nthe Secretary-General and the Government of Iraq will\r\nserve effectively to achieve this goal.\r\nThe continuing crisis in the Balkans is another\r\nexample of the crucial current difficulties faced by the\r\nSecurity Council itself. The permanent attention to the\r\nsituations in Kosovo, Macedonia and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, as well as in Prevlaka, has already given\r\nnot only the necessary political message to the players\r\nin the Balkans arena but has also given an extremely\r\nimportant impetus to the democratic and stabilizing\r\ndevelopments in that region. At the same time, the\r\nremaining problems demonstrate that the situation in\r\nthe Balkans cannot be improved simply by paperwork,\r\nstatements or declarations. The results of the activities\r\nof the Security Council over the period under\r\ndiscussion strengthen our belief that the successful\r\nresolution of the crisis in the region can be reached\r\nthrough a well-targeted regional peace-strengthening\r\nstrategy, which has to be elaborated by the Council in\r\nclose cooperation with regional organizations, first and\r\nforemost the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Council\r\nsuccessfully sustained the encouraging trend of the past\r\ncouple years by making a major shift in its overall\r\npolicy towards Africa and continued to be actively\r\ninvolved in responding to the conflict situations on the\r\ncontinent, for the lack of which it had been widely\r\ncriticized not long ago. A significant contribution to\r\nthis crucial task was made by the Security Council\r\nsummit held on 7 September 2000. The presidential\r\nstatement adopted at that meeting became an important\r\ncontribution towards the development of a well-\r\ntargeted strategy and shared vision in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security on the continent and\r\nbeyond, and of the deeper and broader involvement of\r\nMember States and the wider international community\r\nin this regard.\r\nThe follow-up actions of the Council were\r\nevidence of its willingness to translate the\r\ncommitments made at its summit into practical results\r\nand an expression of the Council’s determination to\r\nintensify efforts to this end. The major developments in\r\nthis area have been marked by the increase of the\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping presence in Sierra Leone,\r\nwhich every day gives more grounds for optimism;\r\nsteady progress in the peace process between Ethiopia\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nand Eritrea, assisted by the United Nations Mission;\r\npositive dynamics in the implementation of the Lusaka\r\nCeasefire Agreement in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, which continues to receive the most active\r\nsupport of the Council; and the continuation of an\r\nactive involvement by the Council in the peace\r\nconsolidation efforts in Angola. The Council kept\r\nmonitoring closely the developments in the peace-\r\nbuilding efforts of Guinea-Bissau and the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, and the restoration of stability and\r\nState institutions in Somalia.\r\nWith certain important progress having been\r\nmade by the Security Council with regard to addressing\r\nsome of the crises in Africa, it is important that this\r\nprogress be followed by renewed commitments and the\r\npolitical will of the parties concerned to implement\r\npeace agreements and to work towards achieving\r\nsustainable peace.\r\nBy offering these remarks, my intention was to\r\nemphasize that the Security Council has a special role\r\nto play in establishing a new pattern of international\r\ncooperation as we enter a new era with new challenges.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): First, I should like to\r\nexpress our thanks to Ambassador Ryan, President of\r\nthe Security Council for the month of October, for his\r\nintroduction of the Council’s annual report to the\r\nAssembly. Submitted under Article 24 of the United\r\nNations Charter, this report serves as the most\r\nimportant link between the two bodies — the General\r\nAssembly, where 189 sovereign States are represented,\r\nand the Security Council, which is entrusted by the\r\nMember States with the crucial responsibility of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. The\r\nreport enables Member States to give their impressions\r\non the work of the Council and review its\r\neffectiveness. For these reasons, we continue to attach\r\nimportance to the present mechanism of annual\r\nreporting by the Council.\r\nAlthough there are various other formats that the\r\nCouncil has devised over the years to inform the\r\nGeneral Assembly membership of its important\r\nactivities, the annual report remains the most useful\r\npackage of information for the majority of States,\r\nparticularly those States with limited human resources,\r\nregarding the wide-ranging activities of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nBefore going to the substance of the report, I wish\r\nto make some observations on the format of the report\r\nand the efforts of the Council to strengthen its\r\neffectiveness. The report of the Council, as it is\r\nstructured, is a comprehensive document containing\r\nmany details. Despite the efforts by the Security\r\nCouncil to make it more analytical, we regard this as\r\nan area that needs further strengthening. It is in this\r\nregard that we share the views so eloquently put\r\nforward by Ambassador Mahbubani. The Members\r\nneed more information on the thinking and the analysis\r\nbehind the consideration of peace and security issues of\r\nwhich the Council remains seized. How the Security\r\nCouncil perceived these issues is more significant and\r\nvaluable to us other Members than the description of\r\nthe events in chronological order. We do attach some\r\nvalue to the facts and information provided by the\r\nreport. However, we strongly wish to be informed of\r\nthe conceptual reasoning that surrounded the\r\nconsideration of each issue before the Council.\r\nIn this regard, we are encouraged that the report\r\ncontinues to provide us with the assessment of the\r\nwork of the Council by its Presidents during their\r\nrespective presidencies. Though these assessments are\r\nno substitute for a more analytical report of the\r\nCouncil, they give us information that helps us\r\nunderstand clearly how issues before the Council\r\nevolved and how the Council reacted to the unfolding\r\ndevelopments concerning them. It is also from these\r\npresidential assessments that we are informed about the\r\nuseful visits to the regions of concern by high-level\r\nUnited Nations officials and the considered views they\r\nshare with the Council as to the further steps needed.\r\nWe are grateful for these assessments, which make the\r\nwork of the Council more transparent.\r\nIn this connection, the idea of monthly public\r\nwrap-up discussions on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil is a useful initiative. We strongly believe that\r\nthis process enhances the effectiveness of the Council\r\nin the long run. My delegation would like to express its\r\nsupport for the Council’s initiatives, through these\r\nwrap-up discussions, to bring more transparency and\r\nopenness to its work.\r\nThe Council’s openness and transparency in its\r\nwork can only strengthen its credibility, as well as its\r\nefficiency and effectiveness. The involvement of all\r\nconcerned in the consideration of peacekeeping\r\noperations also enhances the Council’s commitment to\r\ntransparency. We are therefore grateful to observe the\r\nsteps taken by the Council to strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the troop-contributing countries, on the one\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nhand, and the Security Council and the Secretariat, on\r\nthe other. These steps, by promoting a transparent\r\nrelationship between the three actors, will foster a new\r\nspirit of partnership, cooperation and confidence. In\r\nthis context, we believe that the unanimous adoption of\r\nCouncil resolution 1353 (2001) will further strengthen\r\nthe partnership.\r\nThe effectiveness of the Council depends in large\r\nmeasure on the implementation of its relevant\r\nresolutions in conflict situations. The implementation\r\nprocess encompasses many key actors, such as various\r\nUnited Nations agencies, those on the ground and\r\nrelevant communities of the country or the region\r\nconcerned. The successful implementation of a Council\r\nresolution clearly needs the full support of these key\r\nactors. The Council’s initiative to enlist the support of\r\nthe key actors through its missions to conflict areas is\r\ncommendable. We believe that such high-level\r\nmissions will send a clear message to all concerned\r\nthat it is the strong wish of the international community\r\nto see the issues resolved.\r\nConcerning the substantive side of the report, we\r\nfind that the Council remains seized with many conflict\r\nsituations and crises. Due to the lack of political will of\r\nthe parties concerned, long-standing problems remain\r\non its agenda. In this regard, the Council’s continued\r\nefforts to focus on specific issues that have a negative\r\nbearing on a conflict situation need to be encouraged\r\nand maintained. We are pleased to observe that the\r\nCouncil, in the period under consideration, engaged in\r\ndebates on very relevant issues, such as women, peace\r\nand security; HIV/AIDS; the protection of civilians in\r\narmed conflict; and children in armed conflict. We\r\nbelieve that these thematic discussions will contribute\r\nto strengthening the Council’s effectiveness.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping operations, we are\r\nheartened that the report of the Panel on United\r\nNations Peace Operations (A/55/305) has been\r\ncomprehensively reviewed by the Working Group\r\nestablished by the Security Council. Security Council\r\nresolution 1327 (2000), adopted in response to the\r\nreport of the Panel, contains useful recommendations\r\nsubmitted by the Working Group. We ardently hope\r\nthat the recommendations will go a long way towards\r\neffecting needed changes in the peacekeeping\r\noperations of the Organization.\r\nLet me now make a few comments on the issue of\r\nsanctions. When the framers of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations considered sanction provisions for\r\ninclusion in the Charter, they had the best of intentions\r\nand the noblest of thoughts in making sanctions\r\nregimes a primary tool of peace enforcement. At the\r\nsame time, resort to sanctions regimes under Article 41\r\nof the Charter, be they comprehensive or otherwise, has\r\nnever been an easy task. The simple reason is that a\r\nsanctions regime has unintended negative and\r\ncollateral impact.\r\nPrimarily due to the severe impact of sanctions, it\r\nhas been accepted that sanctions should be a last-resort\r\ntool in peace enforcement. We are encouraged that\r\nmany reviews of sanctions regimes have been\r\nconducted both within and outside the United Nations\r\nsystem to make them a more effective tool, rather than\r\na blunt instrument. Despite these reviews, there has\r\nbeen a general feeling that improvements are still\r\nneeded in the way sanctions are being applied.\r\nQuestions still linger as to how long a sanctions regime\r\nshould stay and what and who could objectively\r\ndetermine that a country concerned has complied with\r\nthe demands of the international community. We\r\nstrongly feel that the lifting of a sanctions regime,\r\nespecially a comprehensive one, should be governed by\r\nobjective considerations.\r\nIn this regard, we are pleased to observe that the\r\nSecurity Council established a Working Group to\r\ndevelop general recommendations on how to improve\r\nthe effectiveness of sanctions. At the same time, while\r\nwe recognize the progress made in the Working Group,\r\nwe are discouraged that major aspects of the sanctions\r\nissue, such as time limits for and the lifting of\r\nsanctions, remain outstanding. Given its importance,\r\nwe wish to urge that further steps be taken to make\r\nprogress in this respect.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to convey our warmest\r\ncongratulations to the five newly elected members of\r\nthe Council: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and\r\nSyria. We are confident that they will be able to\r\ncontribute to the successful implementation of the\r\nCouncil’s primary functions. On our part, Myanmar is\r\nready to cooperate with them, as well as with other\r\nmembers, in the discharge of their heavy\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nMrs. Menéndez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me, first and foremost, to congratulate the five\r\nnewly elected members of the Security Council —\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nBulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and Syria —\r\nwhich will begin their mandate on 1 January 2002.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to thank Ambassador\r\nRyan, the President of the Council for the month of\r\nOctober, for his introductory remarks on the report of\r\nthe Security Council, contained in document A/56/2.\r\nThe format of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly has been the subject\r\nof debate for several years in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup of the General Assembly on Security Council\r\nreform. Many delegations, including mine, have asked\r\nfor a report that is less voluminous, more user friendly,\r\nmore analytical and more transparent. Paradoxical as it\r\nmay sound, despite the increase in the number of pages\r\nand items in the report, the part devoted to the so-\r\ncalled informal consultations of the whole is scant and\r\nreveals little of what happens at those meetings, which,\r\none should never forget, remain very frequent.\r\nIt is undeniable that remarkable progress has been\r\nmade in the improvement of the Security Council’s\r\nworking methods and transparency in recent times.\r\nSuffice it to mention the increase in the number of\r\npublic meetings open to the participation of non-\r\nmembers of the Council that wish to take part, or the\r\ninnovative practice introduced by some Council\r\nmembers of holding wrap-up sessions at the end of\r\ntheir monthly presidencies — a practice that we\r\nwelcome, while encouraging all Council members to\r\nfollow suit.\r\nAnother very positive aspect that should be\r\nhighlighted is the very interesting meeting held by the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil reform on 13 June, when several Ambassadors\r\nrepresenting Council members came to the Working\r\nGroup to exchange views with delegations. The\r\nexchange was very instructive and was a clear example\r\nof the kind of interaction between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council that, in our view,\r\nmust be pursued. The exchange of views with\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretariat held in the same\r\nWorking Group last July, on Secretariat procedures for\r\ntaking and retaining notes of so-called informal\r\nconsultations, was also extremely useful.\r\nNonetheless, the reality for the Security Council\r\nis that closed meetings — informal consultations of the\r\nwhole — or semi-closed meetings — so-called private\r\nmeetings — continue to be the general rule. My\r\ndelegation has consistently held the view that informal\r\nconsultations should be held only when there is real\r\nneed for that format. As to private meetings, we think\r\nthere is some confusion about them; this arises mainly\r\nfrom a lack of uniform criteria for attendance by non-\r\nmembers of the Council, that is, whether all non-\r\nmembers can attend those meetings if they wish, or\r\nonly those specially interested and/or affected — or\r\neven none. This issue should be clarified. We know\r\nthat the Security Council Working Group on\r\nDocumentation and Procedures has considered the\r\nissue. Unfortunately, the Working Group has seldom\r\nmet during the reporting period.\r\nSpeaking of the Working Group on\r\nDocumentation and Procedures, my delegation\r\nsuggested during the last session of the Assembly’s\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform that some\r\nvery informal link be established between the\r\nAssembly’s Working Group on reform and Council’s\r\nWorking Group on Documentation and Procedures.\r\nThis could enhance the consideration of all these\r\nmatters related to the Council’s working methods. It\r\nwould not be a futile exercise: we remain convinced\r\nthat further improvement in the Security Council’s\r\nworking methods and transparency will lead to a more\r\neffective Council.\r\nA key issue in this regard is the relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and troop-contributing\r\ncountries. My delegation welcomes the adoption last\r\nJune of Security Council resolution 1353 (2001), on\r\nstrengthening cooperation with troop-contributing\r\ncountries. That resolution is an important step forward,\r\nand we trust that its implementation will contribute to\r\nimproving the peacekeeping activities of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nBy the same token, we hope that the assessment\r\nof measures adopted by the Council, which the Council\r\nhas committed itself to undertake within six months of\r\nadoption, in the framework of its Working Group on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations, will help us make progress\r\ntowards the establishment of an appropriate mechanism\r\nthat will make it possible for troop-contributing\r\ncountries to participate in a meaningful way in the\r\nprocess of taking decisions that affect them, it being\r\nunderstood, of course, that final decision-making is the\r\nexclusive province of the Council.\r\nMr. Pradhan (Bhutan): First of all, I would like\r\nto thank Ambassador Richard Ryan of Ireland, the\r\ncurrent President of the Security Council, for\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nintroducing the report of the Council to the General\r\nAssembly (A/56/2). I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate Bulgaria, Cameroon,\r\nGuinea, Mexico and the Syrian Arab Republic on their\r\nelection to membership of the Security Council and to\r\nwish them well as they begin to shoulder their\r\nimportant responsibilities.\r\nIt is clear from the report of the Security Council\r\nthat during the year under review the Council dealt\r\nwith a wide range of complex international issues in\r\nAfrica, Asia and Europe. Some of these were the\r\nintractable problems of the Middle East, Africa and the\r\nBalkans. The continent of Africa figured prominently\r\nin the activities of the Council, relating to Eritrea and\r\nEthiopia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Angola, the Great\r\nLakes region, Rwanda and the Central African\r\nRepublic, to mention some of them. The Council\r\ncontinued to face a deadlock in Cyprus. As far as\r\nAfghanistan is concerned, events have taken a\r\ncompletely different turn after the 11 September\r\nterrorist attacks on the United States and the military\r\noperations launched in Afghanistan against terrorist\r\nbases.\r\nDespite the many cases where progress was\r\nelusive, the work of the United Nations resulted in\r\nsuccessful elections in East Timor. We expect that new\r\ninternational entity soon to join the ranks of sovereign\r\ncountries here at the United Nations.\r\nAmong the Security Council’s initiatives was that\r\nrelated to HIV/AIDS and its implications for\r\ninternational peacekeeping operations, an issue that\r\nindeed needed the highest attention.\r\nOne of our greatest concerns when it comes to\r\nconflicts is the use of children as soldiers. The\r\nattention given by the Security Council and by the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to this great\r\nhumanitarian concern is highly gratifying.\r\nThe primary responsibility of the Security\r\nCouncil is to maintain international peace and security.\r\nHowever, as human history has demonstrated, that is\r\nno easy task in a world that has yet to renounce\r\nviolence as a means of dispute settlement. We join the\r\nSecretary-General in urging the international\r\ncommunity to move from a culture of reaction to one of\r\nprevention.\r\nWhile we are aware that conflict prevention is no\r\neasy task, it is a task that must be pursued. Hence, the\r\nSecurity Council has to have its ear constantly to the\r\nground and analyse the flow of information to ascertain\r\npossible conflicts that could occur. The Security\r\nCouncil must strengthen its capabilities in conflict\r\nprevention.\r\nIn that context, international arms embargoes to\r\nareas of conflict or potential conflict are an important\r\ntool that the Security Council can utilize with great\r\neffectiveness.\r\nWhile economic sanctions are useful and have to\r\nbe selectively used, every effort must be made to\r\nminimize or alleviate the distress that may be caused to\r\ninnocent civilian populations, especially vulnerable\r\nsectors such as women and children.\r\nWhen it was created about half a century ago, the\r\nSecurity Council was shaped largely in the light of\r\nexperience of inter-State wars. The idea was to prevent\r\nnations from fighting each other, mainly over territory.\r\nDuring the course of the last couple of decades,\r\nconflicts have been more intra-national: between\r\npolitical rivals, ethnic groups, religious persuasions or\r\neven political systems. Such conflicts have proved to\r\nbe more difficult to resolve, and the complex\r\nhumanitarian problems that arise are usually\r\nheartrending. Negotiations are often frustrating, and the\r\ninterests of the multiple sides in such situations cannot\r\neasily fit the jigsaw puzzle of solutions. Here, we have\r\nthe experience of conflicts in the Balkans and in\r\nAfrica, as the Security Council report so clearly shows.\r\nConflicts have unfortunately acquired yet another\r\ndimension. As seen from the recent terrorist attacks on\r\nthe United States, terrorism has no boundaries, no\r\nnationalities, and its enemies are unsuspecting innocent\r\nmen, women and children. The weaponry used could be\r\nhijacked commercial aircraft, as recently used as\r\nmissiles in kamikaze-type attacks on the World Trade\r\nCenter and the Pentagon. The terrorists could be\r\nsuicide bombers in restaurants, buses or other places,\r\nkilling mainly innocent civilians. Now there is every\r\ndanger that terrorists could use biological, chemical\r\nand even nuclear weapons. It is very difficult to trace\r\nall the perpetrators of such terrorist violence, in view\r\nof their worldwide networks, yet terrorism has to be\r\nrooted out.\r\nThere must be constant vigilance, and action must\r\nbe taken to nip the danger in the bud and uproot the\r\nindoctrination by those who preach hatred and violence\r\nand who seem to be spreading their tentacles the world\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nover. All-out efforts also need to be made to try to\r\nresolve the causes that give rise to such inhuman acts\r\nand drive people to such great extremes.\r\nWhile the report of the Security Council shows\r\nthat the world has changed a great deal since the\r\nfounding of the United Nations, the Council’s\r\ncomposition, except for an increase in the non-\r\npermanent category, remains practically the same. The\r\nevolving nature and responsibilities of the Security\r\nCouncil call for a membership that is representative of\r\nall continents and major groups of people in the world,\r\nboth as permanent and non-permanent members. While\r\nit is understandable that a large number of countries\r\ncannot sit on the Council, the membership should be\r\ntruly representative of the peoples of the world. This is\r\none of the important keys to the successful functioning\r\nof the Council.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to thank the\r\nSecurity Council for its efforts to resolve conflicts,\r\nprevent conflagrations and maintain post-conflict\r\npeace, as well as undertake peace-building operations,\r\nduring the year under review. The missions undertaken\r\nby the Secretary-General, his representatives and the\r\nmembers of the Council to conflict zones undoubtedly\r\nhad a positive impact on many a tense situation. The\r\ninvolvement of the international community in various\r\nstages of a conflict or a potential conflict will go a long\r\nway towards deterring violence and peacefully\r\nresolving problems.\r\nMr. Petrič (Slovenia): I would like to thank the\r\nSecretariat for the comprehensive annual report on the\r\nwork of the Security Council. The format of this report\r\nprovides an extensive guide to the wide range of\r\nCouncil activities. Much effort has gone into this\r\nvoluminous document, and we appreciate it.\r\nWhile we appreciate the useful compendium of\r\ndetailed facts and data in the report, its present format\r\nstill does not facilitate an analytical overview that\r\nwould genuinely assist non-members of the Council to\r\ncreatively take part in the annual discussion of what are\r\nvirtually the most pertinent issues before our\r\nOrganization. Hence a significant part of the\r\nmembership is deprived of the rare opportunity to more\r\nactively share views and contribute thereby to building\r\nthe stature of the United Nations and spreading its\r\nrelevance in world affairs.\r\nA large majority of small delegations could find\r\nthe report of the Security Council much more\r\nstimulating if it offered a review of methods by which\r\nit does its important work that have been proved to\r\nenhance its efficiency, and if it offered a concise\r\nassessment of areas in which the Council had made\r\nprogress and areas in which it had failed. In addition to\r\nthe useful description of work done, the report should\r\nalso present a wider picture: an annual summary of the\r\nCouncil’s accomplishments. Such a format would\r\nenable a better understanding and response by the wide\r\nmembership of our Organization to the Council\u0027s\r\nactivities and facilitate a meaningful and, if necessary,\r\ncritical discussion in the General Assembly.\r\nThe Council’s reporting to the General Assembly\r\nfigures in the Charter with good reason. It enriches our\r\nOrganization with the important notion of the Security\r\nCouncil’s accountability to the universal membership\r\nof the United Nations. It is therefore important to\r\nensure transparency in the work of the Council, since\r\nits decisions draw their legitimacy from the respect and\r\nsupport of the entire United Nations membership.\r\nWhile the Council retains its primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security, open working\r\nmethods add to the efficient implementation of and\r\ncompliance with its decisions.\r\nLet me also point out our conviction that a\r\nsuitable review of possible improvement in the\r\nopenness and transparency of the Security Council’s\r\nworking methods would bring added value to future\r\nannual reports.\r\nLet me now turn the page and salute the Council’s\r\ndiligent work. We are particularly satisfied with its\r\nprogressive interest in dealing with an ever-wider\r\nrange of important issues that are many times\r\nindirectly, but still closely, linked to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. This expanded agenda\r\naccurately reflects the need to attack the contemporary\r\nissues of peace and security and their root causes in all\r\ntheir multilayered complexity. Peace and security\r\nproblems present themselves differently in the age of\r\nglobalization, and the Council is displaying a\r\ncommendable capacity to change and adapt to the\r\ncurrent security environment.\r\nThis expanded agenda of the Security Council\r\nrequires of all of us that we finally make the Council\r\nmore representative, corresponding more closely to the\r\nexisting international community. That is why Slovenia\r\nhopes that this year we shall achieve serious progress\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nin the reform of the United Nations, and of the Security\r\nCouncil in particular.\r\nIn spite of the Council’s capacity to adjust\r\nflexibly to the new realities, the report under review\r\nfails to give due attention to international terrorism as a\r\nthreat to international peace and security. The surprise\r\nand shock we feel after 11 September are also partly a\r\nconsequence of the inability of the international\r\ncommunity to engage this problem in a timely and\r\ncomprehensive manner. It is encouraging that we now\r\nfinally all stand united in the fight against terrorism\r\nand that this unity has been reflected in two important\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and in the prompt\r\nestablishment of its counter-terrorist Committee, which\r\nhas already started its work. Slovenia firmly supports\r\nthis collective struggle to eradicate terrorism, and our\r\nauthorities are already considering appropriate new\r\nmeasures to help close the gaps in the universal\r\ndefence against international terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, let me especially commend the\r\nclose attention the Security Council has devoted to\r\nissues of South-East Europe. In addition to the\r\nnumerous open meetings of the Council that have given\r\nthe membership of the United Nations an opportunity\r\nto understand and contribute to the full implementation\r\nof international commitments in South-Eastern Europe,\r\nwe also recently witnessed the complete “mobile”\r\nSecurity Council session in that region. Such\r\ncomprehensive, continuous and on-the-spot attention\r\ncan bring peace closer even to the most troubled area.\r\nWe applaud the attention that the Council is\r\ndevoting to the resolution of South-eastern Europe’s\r\nremaining problems, and we encourage it to continue\r\nwith the implementation of its promising road map.\r\nThe Council can rely on the continued and active\r\nassistance of Slovenia to this end, and it can count on\r\nour support, which we will provide to the best of our\r\nability.\r\nBefore I conclude, allow me to make a few\r\nadditional comments. Yesterday my dear friend and\r\ncolleague, the Ambassador of Singapore, expressed his\r\ndispleasure at the fact that, in a way, we are speaking\r\nhere only to ourselves. Very little attention is being\r\npaid to this very important topic — the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the main organ of the United\r\nNations, the General Assembly.\r\nI believe also that this is partly due to the fact that\r\nthe five permanent members do not take part in this\r\ndiscussion. I really hope that next year we will have the\r\nprivilege of hearing their views on the report submitted\r\nto the General Assembly by the Security Council.\r\nMr. Widodo (Indonesia): I should like at the\r\noutset to commend the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, Ambassador Richard Ryan of Ireland, for his\r\nlucid introduction of the Security Council’s annual\r\nreport to the General Assembly. It highlights, among\r\nother things, questions relating to the Council’s\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, encompassing many\r\nregions of the world, as well as matters pertaining to its\r\nworking methods and practices.\r\nThe report, which deals with conflict situations\r\nthroughout the world, contains an update on political,\r\nsecurity, human rights and humanitarian situations. We\r\nnote that progress has been made towards de-escalating\r\ntensions; facilitating access to vulnerable civilians for\r\npersonnel engaged in humanitarian activities;\r\npromoting the democratization process and the rule of\r\nlaw; implementing demobilization plans; and adopting\r\nan integrated approach to the political settlement of\r\nvarious conflicts — all leading to the achievement of\r\nlasting international peace and security.\r\nAs regards the situation in East Timor, it is\r\npertinent to note that the holding of the historic\r\nelections last August and the establishment of the\r\nConstituent Assembly to draft its Constitution are\r\nsignificant first steps towards the achievement of a\r\ndemocratic society. Thus, in considering the future role\r\nof the Organization, including the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor, their\r\nparticipation should take the form of extending full and\r\nunstinting support to facilitate the realization of the\r\nlegitimate needs and aspirations of its people,\r\nincluding in the vital field of nation-building. At this\r\ncrucial period in East Timor’s history, there can be no\r\nstronger foundation for peace, security and harmony\r\nthan the establishment of a thriving and robust civil\r\nsociety, along with efforts to promote true\r\nreconciliation.\r\nWe agree with the widely held view that the\r\nSecurity Council should be responsive to the General\r\nAssembly’s recommendations; be accountable for its\r\nactions and decisions; fully support the continuing\r\nendeavours of the Secretary-General to improve the\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\npeacekeeping machinery; and utilize opportunities for\r\ngreater interaction with other United Nations bodies\r\nand agencies.\r\nAs far as the working methods and practices of\r\nthe Security Council are concerned, we deem it\r\nnecessary to reiterate our call for a change in both the\r\ncontent and format of the report. A descriptive list of\r\nthe decisions and resolutions adopted by the Council,\r\ntogether with presidential statements, depicts an\r\nimportant part of the role played by the Council and its\r\nefforts to make its activities more open and transparent.\r\nThis offers an opportunity for Member States to\r\nevaluate the decisions taken and to reach conclusions.\r\nBut the longstanding concern of the majority of States\r\nthat wish to see analytical reports has not been\r\nalleviated by the persistence of an approach\r\ncharacterized by the compilation of numerous\r\ndocuments, a mere description of activities and the\r\nreproduction of resolutions we already know about.\r\nMy delegation has noted the trend towards an\r\nincreasing number of open meetings of the Council,\r\nwith the increasing participation of non-members in its\r\ndeliberations. Assessments made by former Presidents\r\noffer a broad overview of the developments that have\r\ntaken place and provide useful insights. These have\r\ncontributed to greater transparency in the Council’s\r\nfunctioning and methods of work.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to congratulate the newly\r\nelected non-permanent members — Bulgaria,\r\nCameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic — and to wish them every success in the\r\ndischarge of their responsibilities.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): Once again, the report\r\nof the Security Council is before the General\r\nAssembly, so that the members of this body can\r\nexpress their views on the responsibility of the Security\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. This report, among other things, enables\r\nMember States to examine how the general\r\nmembership can collectively contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It is in\r\nthat spirit that Namibia is participating in this debate.\r\nLasting peace and security is a common\r\naspiration of all Member States, and therefore it is not\r\nonly proper, but indeed necessary, that all of us give\r\nthe report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly the attention it deserves. Against this\r\nbackground, my delegation wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Richard Ryan of Ireland, for introducing\r\nthe report.\r\nNamibia congratulates the new non-permanent\r\nmembers elected to the Security Council — Bulgaria,\r\nCameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the Syria Arab\r\nRepublic. Similarly, we pay tribute to the outgoing\r\ndelegations of Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and\r\nUkraine, which have so effectively represented us on\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nA number of issues contained in the report under\r\ndiscussion were considered during Namibia’s tenure in\r\nthe Security Council. Today, I shall comment on some\r\nof them.\r\nThe situation concerning the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo remains of great concern to my\r\ndelegation. During the period under review, the\r\nSecurity Council considered the situation on numerous\r\noccasions. The Secretary-General issued a number of\r\nreports, and the Security Council subsequently adopted\r\npresidential statements and resolutions, some of them\r\nunder full Chapter VII. In addition, the Security\r\nCouncil dispatched its mission to the region which,\r\ninter alia, held a meeting with the Political Committee\r\nin Lusaka, Zambia. Nevertheless, the situation of\r\nordinary Congolese people remains daunting. Already\r\nvictims of aggression, they are further victimized as a\r\nresult of the much sought-after wealth of their\r\neconomically devastated country. It appears that\r\naggression against their country has become palatable\r\nto the international community. Article 51 of the\r\nCharter seems not to be applicable to the Government\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and so the\r\nstatus quo persists. Furthermore, those who went into\r\nthe Congo, under Article 51 of the Charter, have\r\nwithdrawn, while the aggressors continue to besiege\r\nthe Congolese people.\r\nIn July of last year, the Secretary-General\r\nappointed an Expert Panel on the Illegal Exploitation\r\nof Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. I take this\r\nopportunity to express, once again, my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to Ms. Safiatou Ba-N’Daw, the first\r\nChairperson of the Panel, for her tenacity in exposing\r\nthe shameless plundering of the natural resources of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The Panel fulfilled\r\nthe mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council. My\r\ndelegation expects the Security Council to act on the\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nrecommendations of its Panel, regardless of who the\r\nculprits are. No one should be above international law,\r\nno matter whose vested interests are at stake. The\r\ninterests of the Congolese people should be the\r\noverriding principle, and not the economic interest of a\r\nfew under the guise of national security.\r\nI am making reference to all these issues in an\r\nattempt to demonstrate the widening gap between some\r\nconflict situations and the readiness of the Security\r\nCouncil to take action and implement its resolutions.\r\nThere can be no other question before the Council\r\nto better illustrate this point than the consideration of\r\nthe situation concerning the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo by the Security Council. In resolution 1291\r\n(2000), the Security Council authorized the deployment\r\nof up to 5537 military observers under the United\r\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUC). To date, these\r\nobservers have not yet been fully deployed. While we\r\nregret this regressive development, I wish to commend\r\nMONUC for the good work it is doing in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. There is no doubt\r\nthat the presence of MONUC on the ground has had a\r\nstabilizing effect. And we believe that the full\r\ndeployment of MONUC will pave the way for the full\r\nrealization of the peace process. The Security Council\r\nshould complete deployment of phase II of MONUC\r\nand proceed without delay to phase III. We are\r\nconvinced that only objective consideration of all\r\nquestions before the Council will do justice to the\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly.\r\nAnd only a democratic and representative Security\r\nCouncil will act with the same vigour in all situations\r\nin all geographic locations.\r\nEvery issue before the Security Council is\r\nimportant, for it impacts one way or the other the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\r\nsituation in Sierra Leone, Somalia, Angola, the Middle\r\nEast, Western Sahara and East Timor, as well as the\r\nprotection of children in armed conflict and\r\npeacekeeping operations, are all among the issues to\r\nwhich my delegation attaches great importance.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are costly, and hence\r\ntheir proper planning and implementation are of\r\ncommon concern to all. It is therefore imperative that\r\nconstant consultations between the Security Council\r\nand the troop-contributing countries become the norm.\r\nLast year in October, the Security Council had an\r\nunprecedented debate on women, peace and security. A\r\nresolution was adopted, taking into account the views\r\nexpressed by the general membership of the United\r\nNations. The resolution, among other things, invited\r\nthe Secretary-General to carry out a study on the\r\nimpact of armed conflict on women and girls, the role\r\nof women in peace-building and the gender dimension\r\nof peace processes and conflict resolution. My\r\ndelegation looks forward to this report, as well as to\r\nany recommendation which might be contained therein.\r\nAnd while on this issue, let me point out that my\r\ndelegation shares the view expressed by Jamaica on\r\nthis matter.\r\nFor many decades the people of Namibia were\r\ndenied their right to self-determination and\r\nindependence. As such, we can relate to the suffering\r\nof any people under foreign occupation, be it in Africa\r\nor the Middle East. In this regard, it is critical that the\r\nSecurity Council move swiftly to authorize the\r\ndeployment of a United Nations observer force, to\r\nprotect Palestinian civilians and ensure the full\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the\r\nMitchell Report.\r\nThe situation concerning Western Sahara is\r\nbefore the Council and the General Assembly. In 1990,\r\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 45/21 on the\r\nUnited Nations settlement plan in Western Sahara. We\r\nremain deeply concerned by the manner in which the\r\nSecurity Council is deliberating on this issue. The\r\nSecurity Council cannot, and should not, undo the\r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions calling for a\r\nreferendum in Western Sahara. The Security Council\r\nhas a responsibility towards the people of Western\r\nSahara, and it must uphold that responsibility.\r\nOn Angola, the strengthening of Security Council\r\nsanctions against the National Union for the Total\r\nIndependence of Angola (UNITA) is paying dividends.\r\nWe must enforce the sanctions further and do all we\r\ncan to destroy the ability of UNITA to wage war, so\r\nthat the people of Angola can rebuild their lives and\r\nreconstruct their country.\r\nIn his note in document S/1995/234 of 29 March\r\n1995, the President of the Security Council decided,\r\namong other things, that in order to make the\r\nprocedures of the sanctions Committees more\r\ntransparent, the report of the Council to the General\r\nAssembly should entail more information than at\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\npresent. In our view, this decision has yet to be\r\nimplemented in full, for the current report clearly\r\nshows that some Committees’ activities are more\r\ndetailed than others. In the view of my delegation, all\r\nsanctions Committees are of equal importance, and the\r\nreports of the Council to the General Assembly should\r\nreflect this.\r\nLet me conclude by supporting the proposal made\r\nby numerous delegations that spoke before me that the\r\nviews expressed by the general membership on the\r\nSecurity Council’s report to the General Assembly\r\nshould be seriously considered by the Council and also\r\ntaken into account in the conduct of the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. Only then can the effectiveness of\r\nthe Security Council — and, in particular, the quality\r\nof its reports to the General Assembly — be improved.\r\nMr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): I, too,\r\nwould like to thank Ambassador Richard Ryan,\r\nPermanent Representative of Ireland and President of\r\nthe Security Council for the month of October, for his\r\npresentation of the fifty-sixth annual report of the\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to this\r\nagenda item because the consideration of the report,\r\npursuant to Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter, provides\r\nthe General Assembly with an opportunity to evaluate\r\nthe way the Security Council has discharged its\r\nprincipal responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. In this case the period\r\nunder consideration is from 16 June 2000 to 15 June\r\n2001.\r\nAs a member of the Council since 1 January\r\n2000, and in accordance with its commitments, Mali\r\nhas worked steadfastly and constructively with other\r\ndelegations to improve the functioning of the Council\r\nboth in its consideration of substantive matters and in\r\nits working methods. It is against that dual backdrop\r\nthat I wish to make a few comments on the report\r\nunder consideration.\r\nI would first like to highlight the qualitative\r\nimprovement in the functioning of the Council. This is\r\nmost evident in the Council’s seeking to better\r\nunderstand the conflicts before it. In this connection,\r\nmy delegation welcomes the increase in dispatching\r\nSecurity Council missions to conflict regions. During\r\nthe period under consideration, the Council sent\r\nmissions to the Great Lakes region, Sierra Leone and\r\nKosovo. Although those missions did not always lead\r\nto significant breakthroughs in the settlement of\r\nconflicts, they certainly enabled the Council to have a\r\nbetter grasp of them, thereby helping to shed light on\r\nthe Council’s subsequent discussions and,\r\nconsequently, improving its decision-making process.\r\nThis is particularly useful in developing or modifying\r\nmandates for peacekeeping operations. That is why my\r\ndelegation believes that the Council should continue\r\nthis sort of activity in the future.\r\nWe are also pleased to see more direct contacts\r\nwith parties to conflicts and with regional actors,\r\nnotably through the holding of so-called private\r\nmeetings of the Council. Those meetings have allowed\r\nfor frank and interactive exchanges of views between\r\nmembers of the Council and regional players and\r\norganizations, which does not always take place in\r\npublic meetings. On 29 September 2000, during Mali’s\r\npresidency of the Council, we organized a very fruitful\r\nexchange of views with President Nelson Mandela on\r\nthe peace process in Burundi and on issues related to\r\nthe implementation of the peace Agreement there.\r\nAlong the same lines, the growing cooperation\r\nwith the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) has been noteworthy and encouraging. The\r\nCouncil recognized the need to support, within the\r\nframework of a genuine partnership, the efforts of that\r\nregional organization in the management of the\r\nconflicts and crises besetting the West African\r\nsubregion. In that regard, my delegation welcomes the\r\nmeeting held on 12 February 2001 between the\r\nSecurity Council and the ECOWAS Mediation and\r\nSecurity Council on Liberia. Likewise, we welcome the\r\nsending of a United Nations Inter-Agency Mission to\r\nWest Africa. We hope that its operational conclusions\r\nwill strengthen a true partnership between ECOWAS\r\nand the United Nations, the Security Council in\r\nparticular.\r\nMy second comment has to do with a second\r\nnoteworthy development that took place during the\r\nperiod covered by the current report of the Security\r\nCouncil, namely, the considerable development of the\r\nmeans of action available to the Council — to which\r\nMali contributed during its presidency in September\r\n2000. In this connection, I would like to stress the need\r\nfor practical implementation of the commitments made\r\nat the historic meeting of the Council held on 7\r\nSeptember 2000 at the level of heads of State and\r\nGovernment to find a proper, effective and lasting\r\nresponse to conflicts, particularly in Africa. Mali will\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\npay special attention to the implementation of\r\nresolution 1318 (2000), which was adopted at that\r\nmeeting.\r\nIn the same vein, we welcome the adoption of\r\nresolution 1327 (2000), by which the Council followed\r\nup the recommendations relevant to its competence\r\nmade by the Working Group on Peacekeeping\r\nOperations. Likewise, we hope that resolution 1353\r\n(2001) will help strengthen cooperation with troop-\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nNoticeable progress has also been made towards\r\nenhanced effectiveness and better targeting of some\r\nsanctions regimes. Although sanctions are a useful\r\ninstrument that the Council can use, in accordance with\r\nthe Charter, in well-defined circumstances, their\r\nnegative and unintended impacts have made them a\r\nsource of legitimate concern for the international\r\ncommunity. We therefore welcome the Council’s new\r\napproach aimed at sanctions that are better targeted and\r\nimposed for specific periods, and that lead to change in\r\nthe behaviour of clearly identified groups or\r\nindividuals.\r\nAs the report under consideration indicates, the\r\nSecurity Council has devoted much time and attention\r\nto problems that go beyond the maintenance of peace:\r\nconflict prevention, peacemaking and post-conflict\r\npeace-building. Mali welcomes the fact that there has\r\nbeen increased recourse to public debates and open\r\nbriefings in considering these and other questions,\r\nwhich promote transparency in the Council’s work. My\r\ndelegation will continue to play an active role in\r\nencouraging this trend.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my warm\r\ncongratulations to the newly elected members of the\r\nCouncil — Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and\r\nSyria. We wish them every success in carrying out their\r\nnew responsibilities.\r\nMr. Ahsan (Bangladesh): I wish to thank\r\nAmbassador Richard Ryan for his presentation of the\r\nfifty-sixth annual report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The consideration of the report\r\nprovides an important occasion for the General\r\nassembly to deliberate on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. As an elected member, we shall share some of\r\nour experience on the Council and make a few\r\nobservations.\r\nBut before doing so, I would like to convey our\r\nwarmest congratulations to the newly elected members\r\nof the Council: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico\r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic. We are confident they\r\nwill bring fresh impetus to the work of the Council.\r\nBangladesh came to the Security Council with the\r\ndetermination to pursue three objectives in particular:\r\nfirst, to strengthen the role of the Security Council in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security;\r\nsecondly, to make the Council a more proactive rather\r\nthan a reactive body; and, thirdly, to make the Council\r\nmore transparent and open to participation by non-\r\nmembers and other stakeholders. To promote these\r\nobjectives we supported every effort to ensure that the\r\nSecurity Council has the commitment, the unity and the\r\ncapacity to address, expeditiously and effectively, all\r\ninternational peace and security issues. We have argued\r\nthat the cause of peace and security is best advanced by\r\naction within the United Nations framework. We\r\nbelieve that the objective of global peace and security\r\ncan be better achieved by allowing the Security\r\nCouncil to play its role and by strengthening its\r\ncapacity to implement its decisions.\r\nBangladesh has favoured a more proactive, rather\r\nthan reactive, role for the Security Council. We have\r\nargued that peacekeeping should be pursued as part of\r\na continuous process, involving conflict prevention,\r\nconflict resolution and peace-building, within the\r\nframework of a comprehensive approach.\r\nGiven the political, economic and, above all,\r\nhumanitarian imperatives of conflict prevention, we\r\nhave put emphasis on preventive actions, in addition to\r\nthe need for ensuring an immediate response to\r\npeacekeeping requirements. The Council carried\r\nforward the recommendations contained in the June\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on conflict prevention\r\nin the light of contributions from a large part of the\r\nUnited Nations membership. The imperative of\r\nprevention had been emphasized in this Assembly by\r\nMember States deliberating on the report. The Council\r\nresponded to that report by adopting resolution 1366\r\n(2001), which recognizes the Council’s own\r\nresponsibilities, as well as the competence of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Secretary-General, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, the funds, programmes\r\nand agencies of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, civil society, non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) and the private sector. Conflict\r\nprevention is a shared responsibility. The fulfilment of\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nthis shared commitment will require concerted action\r\nby all stakeholders.\r\nAs an elected member of the Council, Bangladesh\r\nhas promoted openness, transparency and the\r\nparticipation of the United Nations membership and\r\nother actors in its deliberations. We have favoured\r\nholding Council meetings in public unless doing so\r\nwas not in the interests of the objectives pursued by the\r\nCouncil. We have pleaded for the participation of non-\r\nmembers and other stakeholders, such as the United\r\nNations funds, programmes and agencies and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, in Council deliberations.\r\nWe have also sought ways and means to involve NGOs\r\nin the work of the Council as partners in the peace and\r\nsecurity mission of the United Nations.\r\nWe have insisted on Council decision making by\r\n15 members. We have sought to make the Council a\r\nrule-based organ, upholding the principle and the\r\nobjective of collective security in our action. It has\r\nbeen a convenient practice to have a group of friends\r\nfor each conflict area. We recognize the extremely\r\nvaluable contribution made by these groups in drafting\r\nCouncil resolutions, but we join others in calling for\r\ngreater transparency in the working methods of these\r\ngroups to prevent those Council members that are not\r\nrepresented in any of these groups from being virtually\r\nexcluded from the decision-making process. There\r\nshould be an official list of the composition of the\r\nvarious friends’ groups, however informal they may be.\r\nThe list of the friends’ groups and their activities\r\nshould be posted on the United Nations Web site.\r\nThe adoption of resolution 1353 (2001) by a\r\nunanimous vote marked a major step forward in\r\nstrengthening cooperation with troop-contributing\r\ncountries. In accordance with the provisions of that\r\nresolution, the troop-contributing countries were\r\nrecognized as an important partner for peacekeeping\r\ncooperation. Elaborate provisions were made in that\r\nresolution for consultation with the troop-contributing\r\ncountries at different stages of peacekeeping\r\noperations, from their inception to their closure, using\r\ndifferent formats, procedures and documentation.\r\nBangladesh has proposed the holding of periodic\r\nmeetings between the Council and the troop-\r\ncontributing countries, instead of the last-minute pro\r\nforma meetings generally called prior to the renewal of\r\npeacekeeping mandates. Such periodic meetings would\r\nallow the concerns and positions of troop-contributing\r\ncountries to be better reflected in Council decisions.\r\nBangladesh took the initiative of introducing\r\nimprovements in the working methods and\r\ndocumentation of the Council. The Council’s Working\r\nGroup on Documentation and Procedures — the body\r\ndevoted to its working methods — met for substantive\r\ndiscussion in March 2000 and then 15 months later, in\r\nJune 2001 — on both occasions during Bangladesh’s\r\npresidency. In March 2000, we succeeded in providing\r\nfor the distribution of copies of statements within the\r\nCouncil Chamber. This year, a note issued by the\r\nPresident of the Security Council on 29 June provided\r\nfor strengthening the practice with regard to the\r\ncommunication and dissemination of Council decisions\r\nand statements.\r\nThe note brought about three important\r\nimprovements. First, press statements made by the\r\nPresident of the Council are now issued as United\r\nNations press releases, thus ensuring their wide\r\ndissemination. Secondly, as a matter of standard\r\npractice, Council decisions and statements are to be\r\nbrought by the President to the notice not only of the\r\nMember States concerned, but also of concerned\r\nregional organizations and arrangements. Thirdly,\r\nthrough the Secretary-General’s representatives in the\r\nfield, the secretariat will now arrange for the timely\r\nand effective communication of Council decisions and\r\nstatements, as well as their widest possible\r\ndissemination.\r\nEfforts have been made to enhance cooperation\r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly. At the\r\ninvitation of the President of the General Assembly,\r\nduring Bangladesh’s presidency in June 2001, the\r\nPresident and representatives of two other members —\r\nColombia and the United Kingdom — participated in a\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly’s Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform devoted to\r\nworking methods. The President of the Council shared\r\nthe experience of the Council over the year and noted\r\nthe improvements made in the Council’s working\r\nmethods. The Ambassadors of Colombia and of the\r\nUnited Kingdom added further reflections on how to\r\nimprove the functioning of the Security Council and its\r\ncooperation with the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nAs a follow up, we have argued that the Council\r\nshould be responsive to the demands of the United\r\nNations membership. With regard to working methods,\r\nwe have argued that the Council should give serious\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nconsideration to the recommendations of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Council reform.\r\nI should like to conclude with three observations.\r\nFirst, during the reporting year, with a few exceptional\r\nperiods, the Council, as a principal organ has been\r\nthrough an intensive work programme. It has remained\r\nactively seized of conflict situations. We made efforts,\r\nwhere consensus made it possible, to prevent the\r\nescalation or deterioration of conflicts. We sought to\r\nresolve conflicts by sending special missions of the\r\nCouncil and by holding meetings with the concerned\r\ncountries, including at the highest levels. The results\r\nhave been mixed. The failure or lack of progress in\r\ncertain areas have sometimes been beyond the control\r\nof the Council. The political realities prohibiting or\r\ncircumscribing the role and effectiveness of Council\r\naction need no research.\r\nSecondly, the Council has evolved. It has made\r\nconsiderable progress in respect of openness and\r\ntransparency and in involving the larger membership in\r\nits work. It has been more proactive than reactive,\r\nsending special missions to the Great Lakes, West\r\nAfrica and Kosovo in the span of one year, and\r\naddressing issues on the basis of developments rather\r\nthan as calendar events determined by the submission\r\nof reports or the expiry of mandates.\r\nThirdly, there has been a substantive evolution in\r\nthe Council’s perception of peace and security. The\r\nmaintenance of peace and security is no longer seen as\r\nthe work of a fire brigade, acting only when a conflict\r\nflares up. The Council, largely at the initiative of\r\nelected members, devoted a considerable amount of\r\ntime and attention to areas beyond peacekeeping — to\r\nconflict prevention, peacemaking and post-conflict\r\npeace-building. The challenge of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security is increasingly\r\nrecognized as a continuing process requiring a\r\ncomprehensive approach and involving all\r\nstakeholders.\r\nIt might be pointed out that, despite all the\r\nimprovements, a number of conflicts have remained\r\nunresolved, some of them for decades. The obvious\r\nconclusion is that the Security Council has the\r\nprimary — though not the exclusive — responsibility\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe Security Council, like the United Nations as a\r\nwhole, is what its members agree that it is, and it does\r\nwhat they agree that it should do. The rule of\r\nconsensus prevails and the power of veto is\r\ndeterminant.\r\nThe award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United\r\nNations and to the Secretary-General has raised\r\nexpectations higher. We hope that the Security Council\r\nwill be able to do better in the changed circumstances.\r\nMr. Ahmad (Pakistan): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing our appreciation to my good friend,\r\nAmbassador Richard Ryan, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Ireland and current President of the\r\nSecurity Council, for introducing the annual report of\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly.\r\nWe are considering the report of the Security\r\nCouncil in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter at\r\na time when we are confronted with a new challenge,\r\nthe challenge of international terrorism, as manifested\r\nin the tragic events of 11 September. Indeed, this is a\r\nnew challenge for this Organization in meeting its\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThis debate also coincides with another\r\nmomentous event. Last week the United Nations and\r\nthe Secretary-General were awarded the centenary\r\nNobel Peace Prize in recognition of their services to\r\nhumanity. This was a welcome development. We all\r\nfeel honoured. The Secretary-General certainly\r\ndeserved this honour. He has been speaking the truth\r\nand keeping our faith in the United Nation alive. We\r\ncommend his dedication to enhance the effectiveness\r\nof the United Nations and appreciate the exemplary\r\nleadership he has provided to this world body as\r\n“mankind’s last best hope” in these difficult and\r\ncomplex times. We hope that the Secretary-General\r\nwill continue to play a more proactive role in\r\nstrengthening the United Nations as the uniquely\r\npositioned forum to pursue global peace and prosperity.\r\nThe United Nations, our Organization, has also\r\nshared this Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Committee\r\nin Oslo, we are sure, must have weighed the reasons\r\nfor this decision. I am sure that we all welcome this\r\nshared honour. This is a moment for reflection and\r\nsome soul-searching. But should not we ask ourselves\r\nin all sincerity if the United Nations has indeed\r\nprovided the requisite moral edifice and a genuine\r\nmultilateral approach in reordering the global system\r\non the basis of justice and equality?\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nPainfully, our world today is neither just nor\r\nequal; it is divided into two separate humanities, one\r\nembarrassingly rich and the other desperately poor. It\r\nremains afflicted with violence and conflicts, injustice\r\nand oppression. There are people still denied their\r\ninalienable rights, including the cardinal right of self-\r\ndetermination. We hope that the Nobel Peace Prize will\r\ninspire the United Nations to do more and to fulfil its\r\npromises and its Charter obligations.\r\nThe twenty-first century, to be different from the\r\nprevious one — which was the century of the worst\r\ncarnage of our times — has to close the chapters of\r\ndespair and disillusionment. The United Nations will\r\nacquit itself well in doing so if it can secure world\r\npeace and prosperity by resolving the Palestine and\r\nKashmir issues on the basis of justice and equity, by\r\nrestoring stable peace in Afghanistan through dialogue\r\nand reconciliation, by eradicating the curse of universal\r\nterrorism from our planet, by bringing to end the\r\nconflicts in Africa and by evolving a new development\r\nparadigm through cooperation in terms of trade,\r\ninvestment, partnership and interdependence.\r\nThe Secretary-General has himself said while\r\nacknowledging the Nobel Peace Prize that “The world\r\nis a messy place and unfortunately the messier it gets,\r\nthe more work we have to do.” It is a very sincere and\r\ncandid message, which the entire membership must\r\nheed. There are expectations from the United Nations,\r\nwhich it must meet in today’s changed and changing\r\nworld.\r\nThese are unusual times demanding exceptional\r\nresponses. As we confront the universal evil of\r\nterrorism in a resolute and determined manner, we\r\ncannot be oblivious of the need to address this problem\r\nat its roots. The Security Council must rise above\r\npower politics and political expediency and respond to\r\ncrises and conflicts in an objective manner. It must\r\nrestore its credibility and authority and work as an\r\ninstrument of peace and security, and not one of\r\npunishment of peoples and nations. The sanctions-\r\noriented policy of the Council, we have always said,\r\nhas solved no problems; it will solve no problems. It\r\nhas only aggravated human misery, perpetuated\r\nconflicts, undermined State sovereignty, impaired the\r\nUnited Nations image and provoked a climate of\r\nmistrust and confrontation. It is time now to reappraise\r\nthis approach and to revert to the role assigned to the\r\nSecurity Council by the Charter.\r\nIn accordance with the Charter, the Security\r\nCouncil has the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and\r\nthe general membership must facilitate the fulfilment\r\nof this mandate. It is not the United Nations that has\r\nfailed; it is the membership that has disabled the\r\nUnited Nations from carrying out its Charter mandate.\r\nAlso under the Charter, the Council has an\r\nobligation to make its annual report available for the\r\nconsideration of the international community’s main\r\nrepresentative body, the General Assembly. This\r\nCouncil obligation emanates from Article 11 of the\r\nCharter, which authorizes the Assembly to “consider\r\nthe general principles of cooperation in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security”. It is\r\nalso pursuant to Article 24 and to Article 15, which\r\nentrusts the Assembly with considering the “account of\r\nthe measures” the Council takes to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWhile this annual report provides a copious\r\ncompilation of the work of the Council, it does not\r\nconform to the requirement of the “account of the\r\nmeasures”, as stipulated in Article 15. The content of\r\nthis report does not assist the wider membership of the\r\nUnited Nations to assess how the Council discharged\r\nits responsibilities under the Charter. Neither is there\r\nan analysis of what was or was not done, nor an\r\nassessment of whether the actions taken were effective\r\nor ineffective.\r\nThere is an unfortunate tendency to make the\r\nreports voluminous by adding unnecessary\r\ndocumentation, as well as duplication. The other day,\r\nsomebody in the corridors of the United Nations was\r\njust mentioning that the United Nations is perhaps the\r\nlargest consumer of paper in the world and also the\r\nlargest producer of waste paper in the world. I hope we\r\ncan prove this wrong. This comes at a very high\r\nfinancial price, without adding any value to the\r\nassessment of the performance of the Council. What\r\nthe report needs is useful analysis and accurate\r\nassessment rather than needless duplication and the\r\nprofligate waste of financial resources. We can read\r\nnewspapers; they do not have to be reproduced in the\r\nreports of the Security Council or, for that matter, other\r\nbodies of the United Nations system.\r\nA report can only be considered useful if it lays\r\ndown all the bare facts and conforms to the standards\r\nof transparency and accountability. Yet, these very\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\naspects are conspicuous in this report by their absence.\r\nFor example, while the report does provide a list of\r\nmeetings of its informal consultations, there is no\r\nrecord of what was decided in those meetings. Sadly,\r\nwhat is true of this report also reflects the work of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWhat the report does, however, reflect and\r\nreflects accurately, is that some issues before the\r\nCouncil are taken less seriously than others. There are\r\nissues which have remained on the agenda of the\r\nCouncil, unaddressed for decades and unimplemented.\r\nThis selectivity in addressing and implementing its\r\nown resolutions raises serious questions about the\r\nSecurity Council’s credibility. The widely held\r\nimpression that the Security Council applies different\r\nstandards to conflicts in different parts of the world\r\nmust not be allowed to become a general conviction or\r\nrule. All resolutions of the Council must be\r\nimplemented without any discrimination, be they on\r\nPalestine or Kashmir, Afghanistan or any other part of\r\nthe world. The fact is that in all cases, conflict\r\ncontinues, peace remains elusive and human misery is\r\naggravated owing to the inaction of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThere should be no discrimination in the\r\nimplementation of the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil on the basis of their adoption under Chapter VI\r\nor Chapter VII of the Charter. These are mere\r\ntechnicalities. They do not change the objective\r\nrealities or the nature of the problems that are\r\nconfronted by the international community. Such\r\ndistinctions are irrelevant. Technicalities of this nature\r\ncannot be applied to a situation involving the destiny of\r\na people and when there is a serious threat to the peace\r\nand security of a region. This is the touchstone of the\r\nCouncil’s credibility and effectiveness.\r\nWe believe that the intensity and number of\r\nconflicts can be minimized if sufficient commitment,\r\nconcern, engagement, objectivity and even-handedness\r\nare demonstrated by the Security Council. The Security\r\nCouncil is empowered to call upon the parties to settle\r\ntheir disputes, for which ways and means are provided\r\nin the Charter, including mechanisms for conflict\r\nprevention and dispute resolution. Responsibility in\r\nthis regard should not be evaded on the pretext that\r\ndisputes should be resolved bilaterally by the\r\nconcerned parties. If that were the case, then the\r\nquestion arises as to what the need was for us to have\r\nthis United Nations, or what the Council’s real role is\r\nwith regard to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe credibility of the Security Council is\r\nundermined each time it ignores a conflict, leaving it to\r\nbe resolved by the parties concerned. While\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nregional organizations needs to be improved, we firmly\r\nbelieve that the regional organizations can play only a\r\nlimited role in the prevention of armed conflicts in\r\nconsonance with Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nCharter. It is the Security Council which has the\r\nprimary responsibility for conflict prevention and\r\ndispute resolution.\r\nThere has been a trend of late to expand the role\r\nof the Security Council beyond its primary\r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. Efforts to broaden the Council’s agenda by\r\nincluding HIV/AIDS, the protection of civilians in\r\narmed conflicts, the illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons and various other issues, such as those related\r\nto women, international law and disarmament, are all\r\ndistractions which erode the Security Council’s\r\neffectiveness and unifocal approach. They take the\r\nfocus away from its main task and mandate. These\r\nsubjects are extremely important; there is no doubt\r\nabout it. We all attach great importance to all these\r\nissues, but these subjects clearly fall within the domain\r\nof the General Assembly and its various other bodies,\r\nand not that of the Security Council. The Council must\r\nnot deviate in any way from its Charter mandate or\r\nobligations.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities have an\r\nimportant role in assisting the Council in maintaining\r\nand restoring international peace and stability. As a\r\nmajor troop-contributor, Pakistan appreciates the\r\nCouncil’s intentions and efforts to increase cooperation\r\nwith troop-contributing countries in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. In this regard, we recognize\r\nits resolution 1327 (2000) as a milestone in setting a\r\nnew tone for such cooperation. While we acknowledge\r\nthat the Council is still working on ways to improve\r\nthis cooperation, we regret that resolution 1353 (2001)\r\nfalls far short of the expectations of many major troop\r\ncontributors. We nevertheless look forward to working\r\nwith the Security Council’s Working Group on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations to enhance this cooperation.\r\nAnd I must register here our profound appreciation for\r\nthe valuable work being done by Ambassador Ward of\r\nJamaica on this subject.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nI will now briefly touch upon some of the current\r\nworking practices of the Security Council. Closed door\r\nor informal consultations remain the rule rather than\r\nthe exception for Security Council meetings. Open or\r\npublic meetings take place only after behind-the-door\r\nagreements are reached. There is so much\r\nchoreography and dramatization. In the process, we\r\nhave encountered the invisible use of the veto time and\r\nagain. This practice of informal consultations runs\r\ncontrary to the requirements of transparency and\r\naccountability, especially when no record of such\r\nconsultations is kept or shared with the general\r\nmembership, which elects the members of the Council.\r\nAnother recent innovation in Council meetings is\r\nthe open thematic debates. As we understand it, this\r\npractice was introduced to enable Member States to\r\nexpress their views on any given theme or issue, which\r\nwould then be taken into account by the Security\r\nCouncil at the time of decision-making. In reality,\r\nmembers of the Council in most cases finalize the draft\r\nresolution or presidential statement in advance, behind\r\nclosed doors, before the open meetings. The script is\r\nalready agreed upon, only to be subsequently enacted,\r\nlike a play on stage. Such debates are thus reduced to\r\nsterile exercises, as in a debating club or a dramatic\r\nclub, in which Member States are heard, or act, but are\r\nnot listened to.\r\nHaving said that, I must place on record our\r\nappreciation to the members of the Council that have\r\ncontributed immensely to bringing about greater\r\ntransparency in the working methods and practices of\r\nthe Council. This trend needs to be further encouraged,\r\nsustained and reinforced. In our view, these progressive\r\nchanges will strengthen the credibility of the Council.\r\nTo this end, the Security Council is urged to seriously\r\nconsider the views expressed in this debate.\r\nWe remain committed to the comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council in all its aspects. The\r\ngeneral membership’s trust and confidence in the\r\nSecurity Council can be reinforced only by\r\nstrengthening its democratic, accountable and\r\nparticipatory character and not by creating new centres\r\nof power or privilege.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to felicitate Syria,\r\nMexico, Guinea, Cameroon and Bulgaria on their\r\nelection to the Council last week. We look forward to\r\nworking closely with them in pursuit of global peace,\r\nsecurity and prosperity. I would also like to pay tribute\r\nto the outgoing members of the Council for their\r\nimportant contributions to the promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFinally, I seek the Assembly’s indulgence if the\r\nlength of my statement failed to match the volume of\r\nthe Security Council’s report.\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): I would like to express high\r\nappreciation to Ambassador Richard Ryan, President of\r\nthe Security Council, for having introduced the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly.\r\nThe number of open-ended meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council has recently increased, thus\r\nimproving its work in respect of transparency.\r\nHowever, the methods of work of the Security Council\r\nstill lag far behind the expectations of the Member\r\nStates. Closed meetings continue to be the main format\r\nof consultations in the work of the Security Council.\r\nClosed meetings are not the format stipulated in either\r\nthe United Nations Charter or the rules of procedure of\r\nthe Security Council. They also do not conform to the\r\nprovisions of the Charter that require the Security\r\nCouncil to carry out its duties on behalf of the Member\r\nStates in accordance with the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAll issues, except for procedural matters, should\r\nbe discussed at open-ended meetings in order for\r\ntransparency to be ensured in the activities of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council should not\r\nexpand the scope of its work to issues beyond its\r\nmandate provided by the Charter. This would only\r\nresult in weakening the role of the General Assembly\r\nand other principal organs. It is also important to\r\nensure that the activities of the Security Council are not\r\nabused for any specific political objectives.\r\nThe Security Council should take a serious\r\napproach to the issue of sanctions and apply them only\r\nas a last resort for preventing the expansion of conflict.\r\nWhen there is no other choice but sanctions, their\r\npurpose, scope and duration must be clearly defined. It\r\nis necessary and would be useful to establish a\r\nmechanism in which decisions of the Security Council\r\non sanctions are taken on the recommendation of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This would help to ensure a\r\nmaximum level of discretion in taking sanctions\r\nmeasures, minimize the negative impact of sanctions\r\nand prevent double standards in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. My delegation considers it necessary\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nthat guidelines on sanctions, the use of force and so on\r\nbe laid down and that an open-ended working group of\r\nthe General Assembly be established for this purpose.\r\nThe Security Council, with its important\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, should conduct its business on the\r\nbasis of absolute fairness and objectivity. When the\r\nSecurity Council lacks impartiality and is overpowered\r\nby high-handedness, world peace and security are\r\nseriously damaged.\r\nIn the southern part of the Korean peninsula,\r\nthere still exists the “United Nations Command”, which\r\nis said to have been established in 1950 by a Security\r\nCouncil resolution. It serves as an entity that confronts\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, a State\r\nMember of the United Nations. The “United Nations\r\nCommand” is illegal in view of the process of its\r\nestablishment, as well as the mode of its existence.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 84 of 7 July 1950,\r\nwhich is disputably referred to as a legal basis for the\r\nestablishment of the “United Nations Command”, was\r\nadopted in a coercive manner, in contravention of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. The Soviet Union, which did\r\nnot attend the meeting of the Security Council at the\r\ntime of the resolution’s adoption, sent a letter to the\r\nSecretary-General on 11 July 1950, in which it\r\ndeclared that the 7 July resolution of the Security\r\nCouncil contravened the United Nations Charter and\r\nwas illegal. This clearly represented the exercise of the\r\nright of veto of a permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAny subsidiary organ of the United Nations\r\nshould be established by a resolution of either the\r\nSecurity Council or the General Assembly. The United\r\nNations Charter stipulates in paragraph 3 of Article 47\r\nthat\r\n“The Military Staff Committee shall be\r\nresponsible under the Security Council for the\r\nstrategic direction of any armed forces placed at\r\nthe disposal of the Security Council.”\r\nHowever, nothing was done by the Military Staff\r\nCommittee with regard to the establishment of the\r\n“United Nations Command” and the “United Nations\r\nCommand” did not act upon any instructions of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe former Secretary-General Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali stated in 1994 that the Security Council\r\ndid not establish the unified command as a subsidiary\r\norgan under its control, but merely recommended the\r\ncreation of such a command, specifying that it should\r\nbe under the authority of the United States, and that\r\ntherefore, the dissolution of the unified command was a\r\nmatter within the competence of the Government of the\r\nUnited States.\r\nThe “United Nations Command”, though named\r\nafter the United Nations, does not receive any\r\ninstruction from the United Nations; nor is it operated\r\nthrough the United Nations budget. In reality, it has\r\nnothing to do with the United Nations. All the facts\r\nindicate that the “United Nations Command” in South\r\nKorea was set up not by the United Nations but by the\r\nUnited States. The United Nations should take steps to\r\nwithdraw its name and its flag, which are being abused\r\nby the United States. And United States, as a party\r\nwhich assumes direct responsibility for peace on the\r\nKorean peninsula, should take practical measures to\r\nensure durable peace in Korea.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation congratulates\r\nBulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the Syrian\r\nArab Republic on their election to membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. My delegation hopes that fairness\r\nand transparency will be enhanced to the fullest extent\r\nin the work of the Council and that Council reform will\r\nmake further progress in that direction.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I wish at the outset to thank the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Ireland, His Excellency Ambassador\r\nRichard Ryan, for his introduction of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly (A/56/2). In\r\nour view, the Assembly’s consideration of the annual\r\nreport gives States Members of the United Nations an\r\nopportunity to review the events that took place in the\r\ninternational arena and the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, and to evaluate the extent to which the\r\nCouncil has met its responsibilities under the Charter.\r\nThe General Assembly has adopted a number of\r\nmeasures intended to strengthen the relationship\r\nbetween the Assembly and the Security Council, both\r\nof which are principal organs of the United Nations. In\r\nits resolution 47/233, adopted in 1993, the Assembly\r\nencouraged Member States to participate actively in a\r\nsubstantive and in-depth discussion on, and\r\nconsideration of, the reports of the Security Council. In\r\nresolution 48/264 of 1994, the Assembly invited its\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nPresident to propose appropriate ways and means to\r\nfacilitate an in-depth discussion by the Assembly of\r\nmatters contained in the reports submitted to it by the\r\nSecurity Council. In resolution 51/193 of 1996, the\r\nAssembly listed a number of measures in connection\r\nwith the content of future reports.\r\nIn the context of such General Assembly\r\ndecisions, we note that the report of the Security\r\nCouncil indicates that consultation and cooperation\r\nwith troop-contributing countries have become an\r\nestablished practice. We hope that this will develop\r\nfurther with a view to ensuring that troop-contributing\r\ncountries participate in defining the mandates of\r\noperations and their role in the maintenance of peace\r\nand security.\r\nWe welcome the holding, sometimes daily, of\r\nbriefings for non-member States. We also welcome the\r\nmonthly assessments prepared by Presidents of the\r\nSecurity Council; these enable us to follow rationally\r\nand objectively the activities of the Council. But\r\nnonetheless, we continue to believe that such\r\nimprovements are not commensurate with the concerns\r\nexpressed by Member States and do not fully meet the\r\nrequests made by the general membership of the\r\nGeneral Assembly through its resolutions.\r\nThe report is a costly undertaking; it is a\r\ncompendium of decisions about which Member States\r\nalready know. We would like to see substantive\r\nchanges in future reports to ensure that they will be\r\nshort in format but substantial in content. In that\r\nconnection, we agree with the proposal made earlier in\r\nthis debate by the representative of Singapore.\r\nIn connection with the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil, the report makes reference to the Council’s\r\nprovisional rules of procedure. Rule 48 says that the\r\nCouncil shall meet in public. But the practice is quite\r\ndifferent. We learn from the report that the Council met\r\n358 times; 185 of those meetings were consultations of\r\nthe whole. For these, only dates and document\r\nreferences are given in the report. Clearly, the large\r\nnumber of informal consultations runs counter to the\r\nprovisions of paragraph 4 (a) of General Assembly\r\nresolution 51/193, and to the call by members of the\r\nAssembly for transparency in Security Council\r\ndeliberations.\r\nWe understand that a certain number of closed\r\nmeetings facilitates the work of the Security Council.\r\nBut so many informal meetings call into question the\r\nlegitimacy of the work of the Security Council, which\r\nbears primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We therefore call for\r\nrespect for the letter and the spirit of the Charter with\r\nregard to Security Council activities: under Articles 31\r\nand 32 of the Charter, States affected by a question\r\nshould participate in the discussion of that question.\r\nWe believe that the Council’s report should cover\r\nall its deliberations and should reflect all the opinions\r\nexpressed by its members. States Members of the United\r\nNations do not really want to know how many meetings\r\nwere held or how many hours they took. We need to\r\nknow the details: the opinions, the positions and the\r\nproposals expressed in the course of the Council’s\r\ninformal consultations — which took some 325 hours\r\nduring the reporting period.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Security Council\r\nconsidered a number of conflicts and other issues\r\naffecting international peace and security. It was able\r\nto ease tension in some areas, but could not prevent\r\nconflicts in others. That is because the Council did not\r\ncooperate with some of the actors with responsibility\r\nfor international peace and security, specifically the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nArticle 11 of the Charter states that the General\r\nAssembly may discuss any questions relating to\r\ninternational peace and security and may make\r\nrecommendations to the Security Council. If the\r\nCouncil had respected the provisions of the Charter in\r\nthis area and had provided special reports to the\r\nAssembly under Articles 15 and 24, then many crises\r\nand conflicts would have been resolved and tragedies\r\navoided.\r\nIt is clear that veto rights have prevented the\r\nCouncil from taking necessary measures to settle some\r\nissues. It could not lift sanctions from my country,\r\nalthough we have respected all the requirements in this\r\nmatter, as illustrated by the Secretary-General, the\r\nmajority of Members of the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council itself. This fact was also behind the\r\nCouncil’s action recently when it failed to send an\r\ninternational force to protect the Palestinian people\r\nfrom Zionist oppression. These examples show that the\r\nprivilege of the right of veto is not used to promote\r\ninternational security; rather, it is a tool used for\r\nforeign policy purposes by some members. In this way,\r\nthe Council becomes a tool for such foreign policy\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nrather than a tool to be used by the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nLast month the Council looked into measures to\r\ncombat international terrorism and adopted its\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). This was done several hours\r\nbefore the General Assembly looked into the matter, an\r\naction that leads to substantive questions on the part of\r\nUnited Nations members. It also leads to doubts as to\r\nthe legitimacy of resolution 1373 (2001). Furthermore,\r\nno distinction was made between the right of a\r\nnation — the United States — to punish those\r\nresponsible for the terrorist acts of 11 September,\r\nwhich were condemned by the international\r\ncommunity, including my country, and the collective\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations, not a single\r\ncountry or a small group of countries, to combat\r\ninternational terrorism. This has created a climate that\r\nis not favourable for combating the forces of\r\ninternational terrorism; it may even encourage such\r\nforces. We would like to warn against accidental\r\nramifications of all this. These tendencies have to be\r\nreversed before it is too late.\r\nThe Security Council has looked at African issues\r\nat great length. It held several meetings on Somalia,\r\nSierra Leone, Angola, Burundi and other countries.\r\nHere we hail Security Council resolution 1318 (2000),\r\nwhich underlined the importance of cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and African\r\nmechanisms and bodies dealing with conflict\r\nresolution. We are convinced that global development,\r\ninternational peace and peace-building compel us to\r\nhave a global strategy to deal with the conflicts in\r\nAfrica and with economic and social matters. Without\r\nthem, sustainable global peace is impossible. Somalia\r\nis but one example.\r\nThe United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity undertook to help Africa. It is important to\r\neradicate poverty, because the continent has the\r\ngreatest number of inhabitants who live on less than $1\r\nper day. The international community also has to help\r\nus fight diseases, especially HIV/AIDS in Africa, since\r\nit threatens the lives of more than 30 million people. In\r\norder to make sure that we have genuine international\r\nsolidarity with Africa, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\r\nwould like to reaffirm that Africa has to be integrated\r\ninto the global economy, obstacles to exports have to\r\nbe removed, harmful economic measures have to be\r\nlifted, and external debts dealt with.\r\nLastly, allow me to say that we are in the habit of\r\ntaking note of the report of the Security Council. We\r\nthink — and we believe others are of a similar view —\r\nthat this is not nearly enough when we talk about the\r\npriority of the United Nations: the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The ideas and\r\nproposals voiced by Member States have to be\r\ntranslated into practical recommendations, as stipulated\r\nin Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter. If we want to\r\nensure that this becomes a truly important discussion,\r\nthen we should show our determination to support\r\nefforts by the General Assembly to build a better and\r\nmore peaceful and stable world.\r\nMr. Ouch (Cambodia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nMembers of the United Nations agreed in the Charter\r\nto confer on the Security Council primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. They also agreed that the Council\r\nshould submit annual and, when necessary, special\r\nreports to the General Assembly for its consideration,\r\nand that these reports should include an account of the\r\nmeasures that the Council has decided upon or taken to\r\nmaintain peace and security.\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly agenda\r\nitem under discussion, ”Report of the Security\r\nCouncil”, is a very important matter indeed. It is not\r\nroutine, irrespective of the quality of the report\r\npresented. The debate here is the time and place for the\r\nmembership of our Organization to consider the\r\nCouncil’s actions, or inaction, in light of its ultimate\r\ncollective responsibility for peace and security in the\r\nworld.\r\nIf the Council fails to fulfil its responsibility due\r\nto a negative position of a permanent member,\r\nmembers may exercise their own collective\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security in accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 377 (V) of 1950 entitled “Uniting\r\nfor peace”.\r\nPalestine, for reasons known, is not yet a full\r\nmember of this Organization, but we are participating\r\nin today’s debate to complain about the failure of the\r\nSecurity Council to fulfil its responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security —\r\nspecifically, when the Council has failed to take the\r\nnecessary measures concerning the dangerous situation\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, including\r\nJerusalem, which has existed for more than a year, a\r\nsituation that has endangered the whole Middle East\r\nand threatened international peace and security.\r\nOn 7 October 2000, a few days after the\r\nbeginning of the sharp and broad deterioration of the\r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territory, the\r\nSecurity Council adopted resolution 1322 (2000),\r\nwhich, inter alia, deplored the provocation carried out\r\nat Al-Haram Al-Sharif in Jerusalem on 28 September\r\n2000, and the subsequent violence there and at other\r\nHoly Places, and in areas throughout the territories\r\noccupied by Israel since 1967, resulting in over 80\r\nPalestinian deaths and many other causalties. The\r\nCouncil condemned those acts of violence, especially\r\nthe excessive use of force against Palestinians, and\r\ncalled upon Israel, the occupying Power, to abide by its\r\nobligations and responsibilities under the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention.\r\nThat was a reasonable and adequate response on\r\nthe part of the Security Council at the time.\r\nUnfortunately, however, the situation continued to\r\ndeteriorate, and the calls made by the Council were not\r\nheeded by the occupying Power. The 80 Palestinian\r\ndeaths increased to hundreds, the hundreds of injured\r\nbecame thousands, the destruction became widespread\r\nand economic and living conditions severely worsened,\r\nthereby endangering the entire region.\r\nFor our part, we sent more than 70 letters to the\r\nSecurity Council detailing the situation on the ground\r\nand calling for action by the Council. But no decision\r\nwhatsoever was taken by the Council during that\r\nperiod, which lasted more than a year. Not even a\r\nfollow-up of its own resolution 1322 (2000) was\r\nundertaken.\r\nThe Council’s inaction was not due to any lack of\r\nattempts or willingness on the part of the\r\noverwhelming majority of the members of the Council.\r\nIn fact, many attempts were made to that end. The\r\nCouncil convened five public meetings to consider the\r\nsituation, and a large number of Member States\r\nparticipated in the debate. Private meetings were also\r\nheld with leaders of the region, including President\r\nYasser Arafat. Members of the Council’s Non-Aligned\r\nMovement Caucus repeatedly submitted draft\r\nresolutions that were supported by other members, as\r\ndid European members in some cases. But concrete\r\naction was never taken.\r\nA draft resolution was put to the vote but was not\r\nadopted because it did not receive the necessary\r\nmajority of votes — after a permanent member said it\r\nwould cast a veto if there were such a majority. Public\r\nthreats to use the veto on any similar draft resolution\r\nwere made on two occasions by that same permanent\r\nmember, and an actual veto was cast on 27 March.\r\nThus the Security Council was unable to shoulder\r\nits responsibilities with regard to this specific situation\r\ndue to the negative stance of a permanent member of\r\nthe Council, and due also, I might add, to the\r\nunwillingness of a few members to confront that\r\npermanent member, irrespective of their position on the\r\nissue. One might call that situation a case of\r\ncompounded veto, in which the Council is prevented\r\nfrom taking action not only by the use of the veto but\r\nalso by the threat of the use of the veto.\r\nAt any rate, what happened in the Council was\r\ntantamount to a suspension of the relevant provisions\r\nof the Charter in order to shield one State, in this case\r\nthe occupying Power, from the relevant provisions of\r\ninternational law, the will of the international\r\ncommunity and the Council’s own resolutions.\r\nOne might wonder here why lofty principles and\r\nvalues stop at our borders, and why international law\r\nceases to function where our situation is concerned. If\r\nthe Security Council is not willing to redress the\r\nsituation, then what kind of message is being given to\r\nour people, who are under occupation?\r\nLet me also say that all of the above is true,\r\nirrespective of how one or another party would\r\ndescribe the situation on the ground. The fact remains\r\nthat an explosive situation posing a great and grave\r\nthreat to international peace and security was allowed\r\nto exist for more than a year without the Council’s\r\ntaking any decision.\r\nAll of this pertains to the situation on the ground,\r\nand, in this respect, over the years the record of the\r\nSecurity Council has been mixed. Twenty-five\r\nresolutions have been adopted; none were implemented\r\nby the occupying Power. Twenty-five drafts were\r\nvetoed, needless to say, by that same permanent\r\nmember.\r\nConcerning the overall situation in the Middle\r\nEast and the need to establish peace in the region, the\r\nrecord is clear. The situation has been beyond the reach\r\nof the Security Council. In fact, the last time the\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.27\r\nCouncil dealt with the situation in the region and its\r\npolitical aspects was in 1967 — 34 years ago — when\r\nit adopted resolution 242 (1967), which remains the\r\nbasis of the current Middle East peace process. The\r\nonly exception to this might have been the\r\nreaffirmation of that resolution in 1973 and the\r\npresidential statement made prior to the adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 681 (1990) on 20\r\nDecember 1990. Nothing serious can justify this sort of\r\nextremely unusual behaviour by the Council, in clear\r\ndisregard of its own responsibility and of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations. It is incomprehensible that\r\ncontinued attempts are being made to completely\r\nhamstring the Council with respect to the extremely\r\nimportant conflict in the Middle East, and even more\r\nso when it comes to the situation on the ground and the\r\nneed to put an end to death and destruction.\r\nWe call on all members of the Assembly —\r\nincluding members of the Security Council — to\r\nrectify this situation.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
