(Republic of Korea)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Botnaru\r\n(Republic of Moldova), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/56/2)\r\nMr. Tomka (Slovakia): This is a good\r\nopportunity for the General Assembly to review the\r\npast year’s work of the Security Council and to\r\nconsider its future direction. Let me thank Ambassador\r\nRyan, President of the Security Council, for his\r\nthoughtful introduction of the annual report. Our\r\ndebate is a significant exercise, contributing to better\r\nawareness of the full responsibility of all Members of\r\nthe United Nations — and in particular of the Security\r\nCouncil members — for issues relating to peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMany of the matters dealt with in the report are\r\ncomplex and serious, and the report itself provides us\r\nwith very detailed facts and technical information. At\r\nthe same time, Slovakia, as a non-member of the\r\nSecurity Council, would very much like to see a more\r\nanalytical approach to reporting on the Council’s work.\r\nFrom a quantitative point of view, it is clear that the\r\nagenda is constantly growing. Our focus here, however,\r\nis on the quality and efficiency of actions. In this\r\nrespect, the report should try to meet the need\r\nexpressed by many States for more analytical and\r\nsuccinct reporting by the Council.\r\nThe Security Council has had its successes, but\r\nalso its setbacks, during the previous period under\r\nreview. In our view, a more effective Security Council\r\nbasically lies in its ability to take early action,\r\nincluding providing early warnings and information.\r\nThe Council must be able to take early action —\r\npreferably when a potential conflict or crisis is already\r\nin statu nascendi. Conflict prevention is a difficult\r\nsubject in the Council’s work. Slovakia welcomed the\r\nconsideration by the Council on 20 July 2000 of the\r\nrole of the Security Council in the prevention of armed\r\nconflicts. There is a particular need for a trustful and\r\nconstructive relationship between the United Nations\r\nand regional actors. This is a task not only for the\r\nSecurity Council, but also for the United Nations as a\r\nwhole.\r\nMember States, which turn to the United Nations\r\nwhen their security is threatened, legitimately expect to\r\nbe heard and helped — and without delay. The Security\r\nCouncil must have the willingness and the ability to\r\nrespond to such requests from Member States in all\r\nparts of the world. The success or failure of Council\r\nactions is in the hands of all of us, but in particular in\r\nthe hands of the Security Council membership.\r\nResponsibility is commensurate with the power that a\r\nMember State enjoys. Effective conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building must involve the\r\nUnited Nations system as a whole. Council members\r\nare cautious — often too cautious — and try to avoid\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nactions that the countries in question perceive as\r\noutside interference. As we have seen, missed\r\nopportunities come at a high price.\r\nIn this connection, let me point out two other\r\nelements related to the credibility of the Security\r\nCouncil: transparency and decision-making. In our\r\nview, making greater transparency part of the working\r\nmethod in the Security Council will contribute\r\ndecisively to confidence-building. Openness is a\r\nsignificant goal in itself. But it is particularly a means\r\nof promoting broad consultations and involving non-\r\nmembers of the Council when a decision to be taken is\r\nunder consideration. That may lead to the enhancement\r\nof the implementation of Council resolutions. Non-\r\nmembers of the Council have the right to be fully\r\nbriefed about its work. Furthermore, Slovakia\r\nconsiders that there is a need for the Security Council\r\nto be more open to outside expertise and influence.\r\nMore can be done by Council members to allow parties\r\nconcerned and United Nations agencies to contribute to\r\nits deliberations on specific issues. At the same time,\r\nwe welcome the gradual improvement made over the\r\nyear with regard to closed-door meetings that were\r\nfollowed by substantial briefings or open meetings.\r\nThe role of regional organizations in the work of\r\nthe Council is of growing importance. This is to be\r\nwelcomed, but more could be done. In the Balkans, the\r\nactions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union\r\nand others continue to prove essential for peace and\r\nstability. Yet the Security Council can never abdicate\r\nits primary responsibility for maintaining or restoring\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIt is essential to maintain the efficiency of the\r\nSecurity Council’s decision-making. We welcome the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General dated 20 April 2000\r\nentitled “No exit without strategy: Security Council\r\ndecision-making and the closure or transition of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations”. This report provides\r\nvaluable guidelines for all of us, both members and\r\nnon-members of the Security Council.\r\nBefore I conclude my statement, let me\r\ncongratulate the newly elected members of the Security\r\nCouncil: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic. We express the hope that they\r\nwill relentlessly work for the just cause of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWe certainly realize that the Security Council\r\nmay not be able to resolve all conflicts. But we, as\r\nMembers of the United Nations — and all of us as\r\nhuman beings — have reason to expect that the\r\nCouncil will at all times manifest a serious effort to\r\nstop human suffering resulting from threats to peace,\r\nno matter where they occur.\r\nMr. Navarrete (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nOnce again, we the States Members of the United\r\nNations are present here on this annual occasion that\r\noffers us an opportunity to express in the General\r\nAssembly our views on the report on the activities of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express its appreciation\r\nto the President of the Council for the month of\r\nOctober, Ambassador Richard Ryan, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Ireland, for introducing the report\r\nbefore us today, which consists of several sections\r\ncontaining information on the work of the Council\r\nduring the period from 16 June 2000 to 15 June 2001.\r\nOnce again, we note with concern that,\r\nregrettably, the annual report does not address the\r\nconcerns that Member States have repeatedly expressed\r\nregarding the need for the report to be devoted to a\r\nreview of substantive issues and to relevant\r\ninformation on the decision-making process and the\r\nitems considered at the various meetings of the\r\nCouncil, whose resolutions affect all Member States.\r\nAs it has done on numerous other occasions, the\r\nMexican delegation would like to stress the need for\r\nthe Security Council to fully discharge its obligation\r\nunder Article 24, paragraph 3, and Article 15,\r\nparagraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations by\r\nensuring that the annual and special reports that it\r\nsubmits to the General Assembly are analytical and\r\nsubstantive and not mere compendiums of documents,\r\nresolutions and decisions that have already been\r\npublished and with which we are all familiar\r\nbeforehand.\r\nAs for its actual contents, we recognize that the\r\nreport may be of great interest to an academic or\r\nresearcher interested in learning about the list of items,\r\nthe annual collection of resolutions and presidential\r\nstatements, and the documents of the Security Council.\r\nWe believe, however, that this document should go\r\nfurther and be recognized as a source of substantive\r\ninformation on the treatment of each of the items under\r\nconsideration by the Council, which would also fulfil\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nthe obligation of that organ to keep all Member States\r\nof the Organization adequately informed.\r\nIn this connection, we support the decision of the\r\nSecurity Council to begin the consideration of the\r\nannual report in an informal working group charged\r\nwith reviewing the documentation and procedural\r\naspects of the Council, with a view, as I already\r\nmentioned, to ensuring that the Council fully\r\ndischarges its obligation to regularly update the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction that, once again,\r\nthe report contains monthly reviews prepared by the\r\nPresidents of the Council on the work of that organ\r\nduring the month in which they presided over its work.\r\nThese documents are useful and valuable and may well\r\nconstitute the most substantive and readable part of the\r\nreport. We welcome the continuation of the practice\r\ninitiated by Costa Rica to publish them in a timely\r\nmanner as official documents of the Council.\r\nMy delegation believes that the exchange of\r\ninformation between members of the Security Council\r\nand members of the General Assembly should be more\r\ndynamic. While not failing to recognize the efforts of\r\nthe Council to increase the number of its formal\r\nmeetings, we regret that the number of closed meetings\r\ncontinues to be higher than the number of open\r\nmeetings. We once more urge the Council to fully\r\nrespect the spirit and the letter of rule 48 of its\r\nprovisional rules of procedure, which provides that it\r\nshould hold its meetings in public. Holding closed\r\nmeetings should be an exception; but, regrettably,\r\ncurrent practice has made that the rule.\r\nMoreover, we must recognize, as some\r\ndelegations have already noted here, that the measures\r\ntaken to improve the working methods of the Council\r\nhave had some degree of success, largely as a result of\r\nthe fact that the members of the Council have listened\r\nto the proposals made in the Working Group dealing\r\nwith the reform of the Security Council. However,\r\nmuch remains to be done. We urge the Council to heed\r\nthe appeal of the Member States of the Organization\r\nand endeavour to submit a report that clearly reflects\r\nthe methodological, procedural and substantive issues\r\nthat together comprise the work of the Council.\r\nI wish to stress the importance my delegation\r\nattaches to a substantive review by the General\r\nAssembly of the report of the Security Council. This\r\nshould not be merely a formal and routine exercise, as\r\nis the case now, but a genuine in-depth consideration of\r\nthe items contained in the report. To that end, it would\r\nbe useful to implement the procedure envisaged in\r\nresolution 51/241, which the General Assembly\r\nadopted unanimously five years ago. We sincerely hope\r\nthat, in the not-too-distant future, the President of the\r\nAssembly will be in a position to assess the debate on\r\nthis issue and, in the light of his conclusions, undertake\r\ninformal consultations to study more closely one or\r\nseveral of the items contained in the report, as provided\r\nfor in that resolution. This would serve to strengthen\r\nthe role of the Assembly, whose members have\r\nassigned to the Council the primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of peace, and help to bring about the\r\nbalance that should exist between the two organs.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the members of the\r\nSecurity Council have recognized the need to improve\r\nthe Council’s practices and to promote transparency.\r\nWe hope that that conviction can be transformed into\r\nconcrete action. The delegation of Mexico wishes to\r\nreiterate its commitment to a Security Council that is\r\nmore transparent and dynamic, with improved methods\r\nof work and an improved relationship with the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMy delegation would like to thank the many\r\nspeakers in this debate who have congratulated those\r\ncountries, including Mexico, that were recently elected\r\nto non-permanent seats on the Security Council for the\r\nnext two years. My delegation would like to reiterate\r\nits commitment to work and cooperate in this respect,\r\nwhile expressing our gratitude for the congratulations\r\noffered and for the trust that the General Assembly has\r\nplaced in Mexico through that vote.\r\nMr. Manele (Solomon Islands): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to thank the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, Ambassador Richard Ryan, for his\r\nintroduction of the report (A/56/2) of the Security\r\nCouncil yesterday. I would also like to congratulate\r\nBulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the Syrian\r\nArab Republic on their election to the Security\r\nCouncil. I should also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress the warm congratulations of Solomon Islands\r\nto the United Nations and the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, on their momentous award last week\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize — an award bestowed in\r\nrecognition of the efforts of our Organization and of\r\nthe Secretary-General in maintaining international\r\npeace and security and in promoting development,\r\njustice and human rights. It is a fitting award for the\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nenduring significance of the United Nations as an\r\ninstrument of global cooperation for the common good.\r\nOn the other hand, it will also serve as an\r\nencouragement, and carries with it a sense of\r\nobligation for our Organization to better serve\r\nhumanity in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe beginning of the new millennium has brought\r\nnew challenges, especially in the field of peace and\r\nsecurity. The inhuman and despicable terrorist attacks\r\non the United States on 11 September were a vivid\r\nillustration of the seriousness of these challenges and\r\nof the need for the Security Council and the United\r\nNations as a whole to move forward with measures to\r\nsafeguard international peace and security. The fight\r\nagainst international terrorism must include urgent\r\nefforts to implement Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001) of 28 September 2001. Above all, the timely\r\nimplementation of the strategies outlined under section\r\nII, “Peace, security and disarmament”, of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/56/326), entitled “Road\r\nmap towards the implementation of the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration”, is now more urgent than\r\never.\r\nThe report of the Security Council before us\r\nprovides a useful overview of how the Council dealt\r\nwith key issues of peace and security during the period\r\nunder review. However, like others, my delegation\r\nfeels that the report would have been more helpful if it\r\nhad included some analysis of the implementation of\r\nthe Council’s decision and resolutions — for example,\r\nwhether its endorsed actions in troubled areas have\r\nbeen effective or not — and, where required, provided\r\nrecommendations for further action based on the\r\nunique circumstances of each case. I believe that that\r\nwould have contributed towards the full realization of\r\nthe Council’s primary responsibility to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWith regard to conflict prevention, the recent\r\nSecurity Council resolution, 1366 (2001) on the\r\nprevention of armed conflict, is of particular\r\nimportance. Solomon Islands welcomes the resolution’s\r\nbroad and progressive endorsement of a range of issues\r\nrelated to prevention, as well as its recommendations\r\nand contributions to the dialogue. Similarly, the major\r\nreport (A/55/985) of the Secretary-General on the\r\nprevention of armed conflict, submitted to the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council in June 2001,\r\ncontains concrete recommendations to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of various United Nations organs,\r\nincluding the Council, as well as other bodies, agencies\r\nand Secretariat departments, and to strengthen\r\ncooperation between the United Nations, regional\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and\r\ncivil society in conflict prevention.\r\nFurthermore, in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/56/1), the Secretary-General stated,\r\ninter alia, his intention to start submitting periodic\r\nregional or subregional reports to the Security Council\r\non disputes that may potentially threaten international\r\npeace and security. It would be useful if future reports\r\nof the Council could outline the Council’s engagement\r\nin the implementation of these recommendations and\r\nits responses to such periodic reports. Consideration\r\nshould also be given to the time frame within which the\r\nreport of the Council should be made available, so that\r\nthe wider United Nations membership could benefit\r\nfrom fresh information on issues that are of interest to\r\nit.\r\nChapter 21 of the report of the Security Council\r\nbefore us reflects the Council’s informal consultations\r\nof the whole on 13, 14 and 16 November 2000 on the\r\nsituation in the Solomon Islands following the\r\nconclusion of the Townsville Peace Agreement (TPA)\r\non 15 October 2000. The TPA led to a ceasefire\r\nbetween the warring parties and provides the basis for\r\nthe current peace process. As indicated in the report,\r\nthe President of the Security Council issued a statement\r\n(S/PRST/2000/33) on behalf of the Council, strongly\r\nsupporting the TPA. The Agreement was also\r\ncirculated as a Council document. On behalf of my\r\ncountry, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the\r\nSecurity Council for its strong support for the\r\nAgreement.\r\nSince December 2000, an international peace\r\nmonitoring group composed of unarmed military\r\npersonnel and civilian police, mainly from Australia\r\nand New Zealand, has been working very closely with\r\nour National Peace Monitoring Council to implement\r\nthe disarmament provisions of the Agreement and to\r\npromote peace and reconciliation. Progress on the\r\nsurrender of weapons has been very slow.\r\nA review of the TPA aimed at resolving obstacles\r\nto the effective implementation of the Agreement\r\nbegan on 20 September 2001. It was, however,\r\nsuspended indefinitely just a day before a revised\r\nAgreement was to be signed. The suspension of the\r\nreview process was due to the withdrawal of one of the\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nmajor signatories following an incident that is believed\r\nto be unrelated to the process. Nevertheless, the two\r\nmajor parties to the Agreement remain committed to\r\nthe peace process. It should also be noted that the\r\nparticipation of civil society in the review process\r\ndemonstrates my Government’s desire for wider\r\nparticipation and cooperation in the peace process and,\r\nabove all, in conflict prevention. As soon as the review\r\nis resumed and a revised Agreement is concluded, the\r\nSecurity Council will be informed accordingly.\r\nMoreover, my Government’s peace plan for 2000\r\nand its programme of action for 2000-2002, adopted\r\nlast year, include policy principles and strategies aimed\r\nat addressing the root causes of the conflict and at\r\navoiding the recurrence of such conflict. The continued\r\nparticipation and support of our development partners\r\nis crucial to our rehabilitation and reconstruction\r\nefforts, as well as to lasting peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFinally, my delegation welcomes the Security\r\nCouncil’s growing interest in the protection of\r\ncivilians, in particular women and children, in conflict\r\nsituations, and its focused attention on issues such as\r\nHIV/AIDS. We hope it will demonstrate a similar\r\nunderstanding and interest in issues like environmental\r\ndegradation, in particular climate change and sea-level\r\nrise, which directly undermines the human security and\r\nthe very existence of small island developing States,\r\nincluding Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Šahović (Yugoslavia): Allow me to begin by\r\nexpressing the appreciation of my delegation to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador Ryan,\r\nPermanent Representative of Ireland, for his\r\nintroduction of the report of the Security Council. I\r\nwould also like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nthe outgoing Council members for their valuable\r\ncontribution in the past period and to extend\r\ncongratulations to the newly elected non-permanent\r\nmembers: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and\r\nSyria. I wish them success in discharging their\r\nextremely important and serious responsibilities in the\r\ncoming two years.\r\nIndeed, the report of the Security Council\r\nprovides clear evidence of the workload the Council\r\nhas to deal with and the variety of issues it has to\r\ncover. In addition, the Nobel Peace Prize recently\r\nawarded to the United Nations and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral provides fresh momentum for the Organization\r\nas a whole, and the Security Council in particular, to\r\ncontinue to address difficult problems of international\r\npeace and security with renewed energy and\r\ndetermination.\r\nNo doubt the period ahead is going to be\r\ndemanding in many respects. The terrorist attacks on\r\nthe United States last month opened a new and\r\nextremely complex chapter for the United Nations, and\r\nthe Security Council in particular. The challenges are\r\nenormous and the Council will certainly need to\r\nanalyse them and think through how they might be\r\naddressed.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) has set\r\nup an unprecedented framework for dealing with a very\r\nbroad phenomenon, not a specific conflict or crisis.\r\nWhat seems to be fairly clear already at this early stage\r\nis that this effort against international terrorism will\r\nrequire some adjustment in the Council’s methodology\r\nof work. It seems that more transparency and\r\ninteraction between the Council and the rest of the\r\nUnited Nations membership will be necessary in order\r\nto fashion truly effective and persistent long-term\r\naction against terrorism. In this action, which is\r\nbeginning to take shape, all countries will have to\r\nprovide input. Therefore, more cooperation on different\r\nlevels will be necessary, including between the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and other\r\nUnited Nations organs and bodies.\r\nCalls on the Council to adopt a more transparent\r\nand interactive approach have constantly been made\r\nover previous years. Unfortunately, they were not\r\nalways very successful. Perhaps now, in the new\r\ncircumstances, conditions are better for establishing\r\nbroader, more regular and effective communication\r\nbetween the Council and other segments of the\r\nOrganization in addressing not only the acute terrorism\r\ncrisis, but also other outstanding issues pertaining to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIn fact, the debate about the report of the Security\r\nCouncil is, to a large extent, a discussion on resolving\r\nconflicts in various parts of the world through\r\npeacekeeping and similar United Nations missions.\r\nObviously, these missions are many, of different\r\ncharacter, scope and size, and they took shape against\r\ndistinct political backgrounds. Regrettably, as much as\r\nthe report is detailed and illustrative concerning the\r\nCouncil’s agenda, the number of meetings held, the\r\ndecisions taken and the correspondence involved, it\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\ndoes not reflect the substance of the problems that were\r\ndiscussed and the complexities involved. My\r\ndelegation joins previous speakers who emphasized the\r\nneed for a less technical and more analytical approach\r\nby the Council when reporting to the General\r\nAssembly. In this connection, we find many\r\nsuggestions made during the current debate very\r\ninteresting and valuable, for example, those by the\r\nPermanent Representatives of Singapore and India.\r\nWhile it is necessary to improve the reporting, it\r\nis even more important to make further progress\r\nconcerning other aspects of the Security Council’s\r\nwork. What I have in mind, for instance, is increasing\r\nthe possibilities for non-members to make meaningful\r\ninputs in Council deliberations. The Council’s relations\r\nwith troop- and other contributing countries should be\r\nstrengthened as well. Similarly, more possibilities\r\nshould be provided for countries whose interests are\r\ndirectly affected by Council decisions to take part in\r\ndiscussions before these decisions are made.\r\nA sizeable portion of the Security Council report\r\nis dedicated to the issues directly involving my country\r\nor its immediate vicinity. Indeed, the Council devoted,\r\nand is continuing to do so, much time and energy to the\r\nBalkans. In this connection, I would like to make some\r\ncomments.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report,\r\nsignificant positive changes took place in Yugoslavia\r\nand the region as a whole. Unfortunately, the situation\r\nin some areas is still very complex and is fraught with\r\nthe potential to deteriorate to open confrontations and\r\nclashes. The Security Council, therefore, has to\r\ncontinue to follow developments closely and to react\r\npromptly to events and trends that may destabilize the\r\nregion. It is not enough to review periodically the\r\nperformance of a mission that the Council has\r\nestablished and leave all decisions to a mission’s\r\nleadership on the ground. On the contrary, the Council\r\nshould provide guidance as the situation evolves and\r\nchanges, rather than simply being guided by the\r\nmission’s leadership. In other words, a proactive\r\nmethod is required to create conditions for the\r\nsuccessful outcome of a mission.\r\nI am glad to be able to note that the Council is\r\nincreasingly inclined to apply such an active approach\r\nwith regard to the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration in Kosovo (UNMIK). I believe that it\r\nshould continue to do so. At the end of the period\r\ncovered by the report, the Council delegation visited\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, both the mission\r\narea in Kosovo and Metohija and Belgrade. The\r\nbenefits of first-hand insight were immediately visible.\r\nThis visit contributed to the improvement of dialogue\r\nbetween the Council and my Government, which has\r\nsignificantly intensified and qualitatively advanced in\r\nthe past year.\r\nThe importance of frequent and constructive\r\nexchanges of views between the Council and countries\r\ndirectly involved in issues on its agenda has been\r\nemphasized during this debate, as well as on a number\r\nof previous occasions. In this connection, I would like\r\nto mention the note by the President of the Security\r\nCouncil of 25 September of this year, in which it is\r\nstated, inter alia, that “it is essential that ... the\r\nGovernment of the host country be fully engaged\r\nduring the life of a mission” (S/2001/905, para.3). We\r\nfully share that view. We also think that there is a need\r\nand room for further broadening such cooperation, and\r\nwe are ready to contribute to that end.\r\nThis is particularly true at this point in time, only\r\na month before elections in Kosovo and Metohija. As is\r\nwell known, the situation in this province of the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia’s Republic of Serbia is\r\nstill very grave and much has to be done to improve it\r\nand make it possible for all voters to participate in the\r\nelections. Therefore, it is crucial that a joint effort to\r\nthat end is made by the Security Council, UNMIK and\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in accordance with\r\nresolution 1244 (1999). The eventual success of\r\nUNMIK is in the interest of both the Council and the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, and we should work\r\ntogether towards that goal.\r\nAs I already mentioned, a number of issues\r\nregarding the situation in the Balkans are on the\r\nSecurity Council’s agenda. While each is specific in\r\nnature, they are all part of a larger picture and in that\r\nsense are interrelated and connected. In a way and to\r\nsome extent, the Council recognized this reality by, for\r\nexample, adopting resolution 1345 (2001) earlier this\r\nyear. We in Yugoslavia are of the view that the region\r\nshould begin to consider how to address in totality and\r\ncomprehensively its existing problems. We also believe\r\nthat in such a process the role of the Security Council\r\nis indispensable.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the hope of\r\nmy delegation that many constructive comments made\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nduring this debate will be translated into practical\r\naction and will contribute to the even more efficient\r\nand effective work of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation wishes to express its gratitude to\r\nAmbassador Ryan, the Permanent Representative of\r\nIreland and President of the Security Council, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council under\r\nconsideration. We also wish to thank the Secretariat for\r\npreparing this comprehensive report.\r\nWe are aware of the delicacy of the relations\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly but that does not prevent us from saying that\r\nthe Council should have submitted an analytical report\r\nthat would have enabled the Assembly to perform its\r\nduty of considering the report’s form and content in\r\nconformity with the relevant articles of the Charter. We\r\nhope that we will achieve real democracy in the United\r\nNations, particularly in the relations between these two\r\norgans, in which each organ will perform its role\r\nwithout fear of the role of the other organ. An objective\r\nanalysis of the positive and negative aspects of the\r\nCouncil’s work would no doubt help us better\r\nunderstand future relations at the international level\r\nand within the context of the United Nations system.\r\nThe Council currently acts alone and exercises\r\ncontrol over the Organization’s work; this limits the\r\nOrganizations’s freedom and kills the spirit of initiative\r\nthat has characterized the Assembly and its various\r\ncommittees and subcommittees. The report under\r\nconsideration was issued in accordance with Article 15\r\nand Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter. In our view,\r\nthose articles have not been fully respected, because\r\nthe General Assembly debate on the report has so far\r\nbeen a formality lacking spirit and cohesion. We\r\nbelieve the Council should have been daring enough to\r\ntell us objectively where it succeeded in its mission and\r\nwhere it failed in dealing with the problems it faced\r\nduring the period under review. It does not necessarily\r\nneed to give us a detailed analysis for every action\r\ntaken, but rather one for every subject, such as peace\r\nand security, peacekeeping operations, sanctions and\r\nothers. It should tell us when the veto was employed\r\nand why, and when the threat of using the veto was\r\nemployed and what the results of the threat were.\r\nThe Council has to accept democratically what\r\nthe General Assembly declares. It also has to be honest\r\nin saying where it applied the Charter clearly and\r\ntransparently and when it was compelled to use a\r\ndouble-standard, failing to act in accordance with the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe believe that the question of sanctions on Iraq,\r\nfor example, has not been dealt with in this report,\r\naside from references to relevant documents. That\r\ngives a very clear picture of the way the Council deals\r\nwith this grave and delicate matter: without concern for\r\nits devastating implications on the preservation of\r\ninternational peace and security, in addition to the\r\nresulting negative humanitarian consequences.\r\nThe deliberations of the Council and its\r\nsubcommittees are held in closed meetings, even\r\nthough they affect the fate and life of a population of\r\napproximately 25 million. These deliberations result in\r\ndecisions and resolutions devoid of any humanitarian\r\nspirit. They have, in fact, contributed to killing more\r\nthan 1.5 million Iraqis — mothers, children and the\r\nelderly — by the continuation of a complete embargo\r\nwithout precedent in the history of humanity. The\r\nclosed and bureaucratic meetings held in closed rooms\r\nare very often totally detached from the plight and\r\nsuffering that result from the Council’s decisions and\r\nresolutions. But this has been the nature of the Security\r\nCouncil, not only this past year but during the last\r\ndecade.\r\nThe closed meetings simply mean that the\r\ncountries concerned do not participate in these\r\ndeliberations, which means that the Council talks to\r\nitself and makes decisions that are far from being\r\ntransparent.\r\nThis is the democracy that the powerful party in\r\nthe Council wants. We Members of the Assembly have\r\nto get used to it and live with it. The meetings of the\r\nSanctions Committee of the Security Council relating\r\nto Iraq — let alone the meetings of the Council\r\nitself — are closed meetings, even though they debate\r\nand consider issues relating to medicine, food, civilian\r\nand humanitarian needs. The representative of Iraq has\r\nto wait in front of room 6 or room 5 for the meeting of\r\nthe Council to end, and, after that, for the appearance\r\nof some Council members, who may be kind enough to\r\ngive him some information about some of the points\r\ndiscussed in the meeting. Did they decide to give\r\nmedicine to the children? Did they decide to give food\r\nto the children? Did they decide to allow some spare\r\nparts for electric grids? What constructive role does the\r\nSecurity Council play in these closed meetings, while\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\ndepriving the countries concerned of the chance to\r\nexpress their views and provide information that might\r\ncorrect much of the bureaucracy’s information in the\r\nreports prepared by personnel who work for the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe confidentiality of these meetings makes the\r\nSecurity Council vulnerable to accusations of\r\nsubjectivity, of a lack of transparency and of applying\r\ndouble standards. This is the real situation. We are\r\nawaiting reform of the Security Council in response to\r\nthe wishes of the Members of the United Nations. The\r\nsanctions that are mentioned as procedures in the\r\nCharter were never meant to be permanently imposed\r\non States and people. They are temporary measures.\r\nBut the behaviour and conduct of the Council,\r\nespecially of some influential countries, demonstrates\r\nhow those countries want to impose sanctions that are\r\npermanent in nature, contrary to the provisions of the\r\nCharter, and do not take into consideration the\r\nprovisions of the Security Council resolutions with\r\nwhich Iraq has already complied.\r\nThe indifference of the Council and the sanctions\r\nCommittee towards the suffering and plight of the\r\npeople of Iraq is glaring and shameful. How can one\r\nmember of the Council suspend contracts worth more\r\nthan $4 billion? How can we be denied products and\r\ngoods that could contribute to economic reconstruction\r\nand to the destroyed social fabric of Iraq, and which\r\nwould bolster the international community’s efforts to\r\nalleviate the grave hardships of daily life in Iraq in the\r\nareas of agriculture, industry, electricity, water, health\r\ncare and so on?\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, for which the Council is responsible, has not\r\nbeen accorded the attention its requires in conformity\r\nwith the provisions of the Charter and the principles of\r\ninternational law. Indeed, we can say that the Council\r\nhas failed to find just solutions to certain problems\r\ndirectly related to international peace and security. In\r\nthis respect, I would refer specifically to the question\r\nof Palestine.\r\nOne member of the Council has made the issue of\r\nPalestine impossible to solve, even in its human\r\ndimension. The people of Palestine are subject to\r\nmurder, displacement, destruction and direct\r\ncolonization by a brutal force supported by a super-\r\nPower. Is it not the Security Council’s responsibility to\r\nprotect these people, who are struggling for their\r\nliberation and usurped rights? If the Council cannot\r\neven provide humanitarian protection, how can the\r\ninternational community trust it to find a political\r\nsolution to the Palestinian question, in accordance with\r\nthe principles of international law and the United\r\nNations Charter?\r\nThe same applies to Afghanistan. The unarmed\r\nand destitute people of that country are being subject to\r\nmilitary aggression that is merely destroying the ruins\r\nleft behind by previous aggressions. There is nothing\r\nleft to destroy, but civilians are being killed and\r\ndisplaced while the Security Council refuses to debate\r\nthe issue. The Council, as the United Nations organ\r\ndirectly responsible for international peace and\r\nsecurity, is supposed to hold public debates on such\r\nissues or at least, if it cannot address their political and\r\nmilitary dimensions, on their humanitarian aspect.\r\nDoes this issue have no bearing on international peace\r\nand security? Have the Charter and international law\r\nnot been violated?\r\nWe believe that the legitimate right of self-\r\ndefence cannot be invoked arbitrarily and absolutely. It\r\nis a right prescribed by international law; if it is not so\r\nexercised, it constitutes aggression. The people of\r\nAfghanistan look to this Organization for justice and a\r\npeaceful solution to their problems, and not through\r\nmissiles, aircraft, bombs and the intimidation of\r\ncivilians.\r\nIn all honesty, the work of the Security Council\r\nneeds substantive, in-depth and frank discussion\r\ndivorced from selfishness and self-interest. Recent\r\ndevelopments in the world have, regrettably, led to one\r\nPower’s having taken control of and directing the\r\nCouncil, dictating its whims in its own interests. The\r\nresolutions adopted recently merely highlight that fact.\r\nThese developments have negatively affected the work\r\nof the Council and will continue to do so, in direct\r\ncontravention of the Charter. This emerging trend\r\nraises difficult and serious questions about the\r\nCouncil’s credibility.\r\nFinally, I wish to congratulate the newly elected\r\nmembers of the Council: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea,\r\nMexico and the Syrian Arab Republic. We hope that\r\nthey will contribute to restoring balance in the Council\r\nand to reforming it to serve the ambitions and hopes of\r\nthe international community to achieve peace and\r\nsecurity, in conformity with the purposes and principles\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nof the Charter and free from duplicity, non-\r\ntransparency and the narrow interests of certain States.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico\r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic on their election as non-\r\npermanent members of the Security Council for the\r\nnext two years.\r\nI thank Ambassador Richard Ryan of Ireland,\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober, for the introductory statement he made the\r\nother day, presenting the report of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly.\r\nI also congratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nand the United Nations for the world’s most prestigious\r\nhonour, the Nobel Peace Prize, that they have been\r\njointly awarded this year. It is an honour that the\r\nSecretary-General has said he accepted with humility.\r\nThis should remind us that our Organization, like any\r\nother human enterprise, is imperfect and needs reforms\r\nto address the challenges before it.\r\nArticles 15 and 24 of the United Nations Charter\r\nrequire the Security Council to submit its annual and,\r\nwhen necessary, special reports to the General\r\nAssembly for its consideration. Paragraph 1 of Article\r\n15 clearly stipulates that these reports\r\n“shall include an account of the measures that the\r\nSecurity Council has decided upon or taken to\r\nmaintain international peace and security”.\r\nAdditionally, the General Assembly, in its\r\nresolution 51/193, has called upon the Council to\r\ninclude in its reports, among other things, information\r\non its consultations of the whole, on the role of General\r\nAssembly resolutions in its decision-making and on\r\nsteps taken to improve its working methods.\r\nThe Security Council works on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership in matters of international peace\r\nand security. It is therefore the obligation of the\r\nCouncil to become transparent, responsive and\r\naccountable in its working methods, which it can do by\r\nbringing its deliberations out from the shadow of\r\nsecrecy and by promoting a participatory decision-\r\nmaking process as far as is practicable.\r\nAnd its report should reflect that obligation as\r\nwell. But, once again, the General Assembly is\r\nperplexed by a thick compendium of formal\r\ndocuments, resolutions and statements devoid of\r\nanalysis, which the Council has presented as its annual\r\nreport. While its sheer volume helps us appreciate the\r\nrange and complexity involved in the staggering\r\nworkload of the Council, it is no more than annexes\r\nwithout a report, a body without a soul.\r\nIn fact, the grandiose flavour often manifest in\r\nthe Council’s work is hardly compatible with the\r\ngeneral health and requirements of our Organization,\r\nand it may well have contributed to compromising the\r\neffectiveness of its other functions in many ways. The\r\nCouncil’s ritualized public debates are a case in point.\r\nWe appreciate public debates with a purpose, but\r\nthey can in no way substitute either for substantive\r\nconsultations or for the imperative of cooperation.\r\nNeither should they be a means to camouflage the\r\nCouncil’s less than democratic decision-making\r\nprocess. What is more, to our concern, these debates\r\nhave proved to be a way for the Council to widen its\r\nscope and encroach on the mandates of other main\r\norgans of the United Nations.\r\nThe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations\r\nchaired by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi clearly pointed to the\r\nambiguous and unrealistic mandates that were\r\nresponsible for the failure of a number of United\r\nNations missions. Given the working style of the\r\nCouncil still in practice, it may not be surprising if we\r\nrepeat the mistakes of the past.\r\nWe welcome the consultations — of a sort —\r\nwith troop-contributing countries, which the Council\r\nhas started on a more or less regular basis. But we need\r\nto move beyond, from mere consultations without\r\nmuch substance to sustained cooperation in all relevant\r\naspects among troop-contributing countries, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretariat to promote\r\nunderstanding, to bring about synergy and to improve\r\ncoordination, which are so critical to ensuring a\r\nmission’s success. In that context, there is an\r\nunmistakably urgent need to involve troop contributors\r\nin all phases of a mission.\r\nWhile the idea of using Security Council missions\r\nmay prove useful to improve the Council’s response to\r\na crisis, dispatching full Council-sized missions is\r\nextravagant at best. The world is watching us, and self-\r\ndiscipline is a great personal and organizational virtue\r\nand an important element of success.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration last autumn, our\r\nheads of State or Government unequivocally reaffirmed\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nthe need to maintain peace and security effectively and\r\nresolved to give the United Nations the resources and\r\ntools it needs to do its tasks. We believe that, while\r\nadditional mandates must be accompanied by\r\ncommensurate resources, wise spending by each United\r\nNations organ, including the Security Council, is only\r\nreasonable. The time has come to ponder this seriously.\r\nEqually important is the question of reforming\r\nthe structure of the Council. In an organization founded\r\non the bedrock of the values we cherish and the\r\nprinciples and purposes we share — such as the United\r\nNations — there should be no “us” and no “them”, but\r\njust “us” and only us. But unfortunately, in an\r\notherwise democratic United Nations and in a\r\ndemocratizing world, the Council’s structure remains\r\nan anachronistic remnant of a bygone era, where roles\r\nare predestined and prerogatives are preordained. It is\r\nin keeping neither with our times nor with anyone’s\r\ninterests.\r\nDuring this debate over the past two days, we\r\nhave heard many revealing insights regarding the scope\r\nof reforms needed in both the structure and the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council, including from sitting\r\nmembers of the Council. We are happy that the\r\nPresident of the Council has indicated that the process\r\nof at least improving the report will soon be set in\r\nmotion.\r\nI hope that happens soon, and that other reforms,\r\nboth in working methods and in structure, will be\r\npursued with a sense of the utmost urgency and shared\r\nresponsibility.\r\nMr. Semakula Kiwanuka (Uganda): Permit me\r\nat the very outset to thank Mr. Richard Ryan, the\r\nrepresentative of Ireland and President of the Security\r\nCouncil for this month, for his introduction of the\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-sixth session for the reporting period 2000-\r\n2001. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the\r\nRepublics of Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea and Mexico\r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic on their election to the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, and the United Nations as a whole on the award\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize. The award is in recognition\r\nof the distinguished leadership of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations, including the Security\r\nCouncil, in their tireless efforts to achieve international\r\npeace and security and to make the world a better place\r\nto live in.\r\nThis debate is taking place at a critical time after\r\nthe appalling, tragic and despicable acts of terrorism\r\nperpetrated by the men of darkness on 1l September\r\nhere in New York, in Washington, D.C., and in\r\nPennsylvania. The role and the leadership of the\r\nSecurity Council in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security are in greater demand today than\r\never before.\r\nLet me take the Assembly back in history. As far\r\nback as 1934 the League of Nations adopted a\r\nresolution that referred to the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court for the suppression of\r\nterrorism, and the 1937 Convention for the Prevention\r\nand Punishment of Terrorism was signed by 23\r\ncountries. However, the Convention was ratified by\r\nonly one country and never came into force. That was\r\nbefore the foundation of the United Nations.\r\nToday the situation is different. In the face of\r\nincreasing acts of terrorism, the Security Council has\r\ndemonstrated its uncompromising determination to\r\nfight this scourge. In its resolution 1269 (1999) of 19\r\nOctober 1999, the Council called upon all States to\r\nimplement fully the international anti-terrorism\r\nconventions to which they were parties. More\r\ngratifying was the recently adopted resolution 1373\r\n(2001) of 28 September, which came in the wake of the\r\ntragedies that occurred on 11 September. The\r\nresolution was comprehensive, and it acknowledged\r\nthe right of self-defence against barbaric acts such as\r\nthose of 11 September 2001.\r\nAs a country which has suffered from repeated\r\nacts of terrorism, Uganda gives its full support to that\r\nresolution and reiterates its determination to work\r\ntogether not only to protect our people from terrorist\r\nattacks, but also to combat any international network\r\nthat supports terrorism. Uganda invites all States to\r\nprevent and suppress in their territories the financing of\r\nterrorist actions. Perpetrators of terrorist acts must be\r\nbrought to justice, and no safe haven should be given\r\nto terrorists anywhere.\r\nUganda will intensify the exchange of\r\ninformation necessary to prevent and suppress terrorist\r\nacts, as well as the exchange of experience in the field\r\nof counter-terrorism. We therefore welcome the\r\nmeasures taken so far to block terrorist organizations’\r\naccess to financing, and we shall continue our strong\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nefforts to restrict the ability of terrorists to raise and\r\ntransfer funds for their criminal activities.\r\nThe escalation of conflict in various parts of the\r\nworld has affected and continues to affect adversely the\r\nwork of the United Nations. During the past decade,\r\nmillions have been killed. They were not just victims\r\ncaught in a crossfire; they themselves became targets.\r\nThe statistics are daunting: over a million people have\r\nbeen killed, and over 30 million have been displaced.\r\nCountless men and women are denied access to food\r\nand medicine. It is imperative, therefore, that the\r\nsecurity of United Nations personnel serving in\r\ndifficult and hazardous field conditions around the\r\nworld be substantially improved. It is an obligation of\r\nall Member States to demonstrate in practice their\r\ncommitment to protect those international civil\r\nservants who are performing their duties in such risky\r\nconditions.\r\nIn its resolutions 1265 (1999) of 17 September\r\n1999 and 1296 (2000) of 19 April 2000, the Security\r\nCouncil strongly condemned not only the deliberate\r\ntargeting of civilians but also the barbaric attacks on\r\nothers protected under international law. These and\r\nmany other acts of terrorism highlight the importance\r\nof having appropriate mechanisms — the United\r\nNations or other dispute settlement mechanisms — to\r\nprevent and to resolve conflicts. We recommend an\r\nintensification of adequate measures for the\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-\r\ncombatants. In this regard, we further commend the\r\nCouncil for paying special attention to the\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of child soldiers.\r\nThe Security Council has recognized the\r\nimportant role regional bodies can play in securing\r\ninternational peace and security, and we welcome the\r\nCouncil’s willingness to work with such organizations.\r\nAccordingly, we commend the Council for its strong\r\nsupport of the Eighth Arusha Regional Summit, on 1\r\nDecember 1999, which designated former President\r\nNelson Mandela the Facilitator of the Arusha peace\r\nprocess.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping, this is a core\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations and of the Security\r\nCouncil in particular. Over the years, some 750,000\r\nmen and women have served in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. At least 1,500 have made the\r\nultimate sacrifice and lost their lives in the service of\r\nhumankind. Africa, however, notes with concern and\r\nregret the ever-increasing reluctance of the Security\r\nCouncil to commit sufficient peacekeeping troops\r\nwhere they are badly needed, such as in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. We urge the Council to reverse\r\nthis trend. Uganda appeals to the Security Council to\r\nassist the ongoing peace processes in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, in Burundi, in Sierra Leone and\r\nelsewhere with far greater commitment than before.\r\nLast year the Secretary-General appointed a Panel\r\nof Experts chaired by Ms. Ba-N’Daw to investigate the\r\nalleged exploitation of natural resources and other\r\nforms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. The report of that Panel was found wanting by\r\nthe Security Council because of its unsubstantiated\r\nallegations. For this reason, the life of the Panel was\r\nextended under another Chairmanship, that of\r\nAmbassador Kassem. As we await the findings of\r\nAmbassador Kassem’s panel, it is totally imprudent to\r\nmake wild accusations and condemnations, as is\r\nbecoming customary on the part of some delegations\r\nfrom the region.\r\nLet me now turn to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We note with satisfaction the improvement in\r\nthe Council’s working methods. There is more\r\ntransparency, and the Arria formula is being used more\r\nand more. Nevertheless, the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation remains unresolved. There is no need to\r\nemphasize that today, more than ever before, the\r\nSecurity Council needs the rest of the world to join in a\r\nspirit of cooperation and interdependence. To help\r\nspeed up the enlargement process, Uganda would\r\nsupport a step-by-step expansion to 21 seats. This\r\nwould be in line with those who argue, though\r\nunconvincingly, that too large a Council would be\r\nunmanageable.\r\nThere is no doubt that the Security Council\r\ncarries the unmistakable imprint of its foundation. The\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security\r\nremains its strongest and most distinctive attribute in\r\nthe post-cold-war era. As we assess the work of the\r\nSecurity Council, and its responsibility and role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\nUganda commends the deliberate expansion of the\r\nconcept of human security. Today the competencies of\r\nthe Council include not only the fight against terrorism,\r\nbut also the fight against HIV/AIDS and other killer\r\ndiseases, as well as the persistent scourge of poverty.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nMs. Jarbussynova (Kazakhstan): At the outset,\r\nmy delegation would like to thank the current President\r\nof the Security Council, Ambassador Richard Ryan of\r\nIreland, for introducing the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the newly elected members\r\nof the Security Council and to wish them every success\r\nin their future endeavours.\r\nLast Friday the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to\r\nthe United Nations and to the Secretary-General for\r\ntheir tireless efforts to achieve international peace and\r\nstability. This is a well-deserved honour for the\r\nMember States and for the staff of the United Nations\r\nSecretariat. We are greatly encouraged by this great\r\ndistinction, and we will continue to provide all possible\r\nsupport to the Organization and to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThe Security Council has always been at the\r\nforefront of efforts to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity. During the year under review, the Council\r\nheld 173 formal meetings and 185 consultations of the\r\nwhole, adopted 52 resolutions and issued 35\r\npresidential statements. It encompassed a wide range of\r\nissues concerning the participation of women in\r\nconflict resolution and peace processes, the impact of\r\narmed conflict on children, the safety of civilians in\r\narmed conflict, and HIV/AIDS.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the efforts of the\r\nSecurity Council to enhance its openness and\r\ntransparency by conducting open meetings with the\r\nparticipation of non-Council members. We support the\r\nCouncil’s intention to hold, whenever possible, public\r\nbriefings by the Secretariat and representatives of the\r\nSecretary-General. We think that the Council’s debates\r\nwill be more effective if it continues to conduct\r\ninteractive discussions between the Council and non-\r\nCouncil members.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation commends the\r\nrepresentatives of the Security Council for their\r\nparticipation in the meeting of the Working Group on\r\nCouncil reform, during which they were able to share\r\ntheir views on the working methods of the Council.\r\nThis was a remarkable event for all members of the\r\nWorking Group.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Security Council\r\npaid special attention to the situation in Afghanistan.\r\nThe Council conducted numerous meetings and\r\ninformal consultations of the whole, and adopted\r\nresolution 1333 (2000). The current situation in\r\nAfghanistan remains complex. It has deteriorated as a\r\nresult of the military actions being taken against\r\nterrorist bases in Afghanistan, which jeopardize the\r\nlives of innocent people. We believe that a special\r\nmeeting of the Security Council on the situation in\r\nAfghanistan could facilitate the political process and\r\nhelp move towards the goals of national reconciliation\r\nand a lasting political settlement.\r\nThe international community, under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations, should address the Afghan\r\nproblem comprehensively and thoroughly until it is\r\nsolved once and for all. This process, aimed at\r\nrestoring peace in Afghanistan and at assisting its\r\npeople in the formation of a multi-ethnic, fully\r\nrepresentative government, should be carried out under\r\nthe strict and continuing supervision of the Security\r\nCouncil. As we have witnessed, isolated measures,\r\narms embargoes and sporadic efforts to combat the\r\ndrug trade have failed to produce any long-term effect\r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September have forced\r\nthe international community to consider the issue of\r\ninternational terrorism as one of its priorities. My\r\ndelegation concurs with the view that, in a new era, the\r\nSecurity Council will be playing an even more\r\nimportant role in elaborating a global strategy against\r\ninternational terrorism. Recent Security Council\r\nresolutions impose far-reaching measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism. The establishment by the\r\nCouncil of a counter-terrorism committee is the first\r\nimportant step towards the successful implementation\r\nof these highly important resolutions. My country will\r\nfully cooperate with the Committee.\r\nRecent events have clearly indicated the need to\r\nstrengthen the synergy between the United Nations and\r\nthe Security Council. The Council also needs the full\r\ncooperation of all of the principal bodies of the United\r\nNations. Every effort should be made to expand the\r\narea of interaction of these United Nations organs and\r\nto promote the role of the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretary-General, who, in\r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter, is to bring\r\nto the attention of the Security Council any matter\r\nwhich may threaten the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. We expect the Council to\r\nimplement its initiative to organize an institutional\r\ndialogue between that body and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would also like to\r\nmake a few comments concerning the report of the\r\nSecurity Council. We note that despite its huge volume\r\nof 571 pages, the report is mainly a compilation of\r\nnumerous documents that do not have an analytical\r\ncomponent. The report, which covers the period from\r\n16 June 2000 to 15 June 2001, describes the activities\r\nof the Security Council during that period only.\r\nPerhaps that is why this discussion today has not\r\nattracted much attention from delegations. In this\r\nrespect, my delegation agrees with the proposal\r\nformulated by certain delegations to request the\r\nSecretariat to prepare an analytical and informative\r\nreport of the Security Council in order to make our\r\nfuture discussions more fruitful and meaningful.\r\nWe look forward to working closely with the\r\nSecurity Council and to participating actively in all of\r\nits efforts to promote the global quest for peace.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nIt might seem unnecessarily redundant for us to add our\r\nvoice to those of the many delegations that have\r\nparticipated in the debate and referred to the serious\r\nshortcomings in the report on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil that has been submitted to us. However, we are\r\ndoing so, first, because of our deep interest in\r\nstrengthening the United Nations, and, secondly, in\r\norder to rise to the challenge posed to us yesterday by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Singapore, Kishore\r\nMahbubani, who encouraged the largest possible\r\nnumber of delegations to offer their views on the\r\nformat and the contents of the report that is the subject\r\nof our deliberations today.\r\nIn this respect, we fully agree with what has been\r\nstated repeatedly by others: that the report does not\r\neven minimally meet our expectations. It is extremely\r\ndescriptive, excessively lengthy and totally devoid of\r\nthose elements that would allow States Members of the\r\nOrganization that do not have the privilege of\r\nbelonging to the Security Council to assess the work of\r\nthat organ. In other words — as has also been reiterated\r\nyesterday and today — the report does not comply\r\nsatisfactorily with the provisions of Article 15 of the\r\nCharter. We also agree with Ambassador Mahbubani\r\nand with many of the colleagues who spoke before me\r\nthat this does not necessarily have to be the case. A\r\nshorter, more analytical report would be much more\r\nappreciated, one akin to the annual report on the work\r\nof the Organization that we are accustomed to\r\nreceiving from the Secretary-General. Just a few days\r\nago, we had a constructive debate on the most recent\r\nreport, which covers the fifty-fifth session.\r\nThis is not the time to go into detail. Suffice it to\r\nsay that almost any reasonable format chosen would be\r\npreferable to the format of this year’s report, and surely\r\nmuch more economical.\r\nAs to my first remark, regarding our interest in\r\nstrengthening the United Nations, I would like briefly\r\nto refer to the implications of the report for our system\r\nof governance. It is no secret to anyone that, as the\r\nSecurity Council has grown in importance, the impact\r\nof the General Assembly has waned. The events of last\r\nmonth underline this fact eloquently. While the\r\nSecurity Council acted, through the adoption of its\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which contains obligations\r\nbinding upon us all, the General Assembly deliberated\r\nfor a week without adopting any decision at all.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThis occurred despite the fact that last year, in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, our heads of State decided:\r\n“To reaffirm the central position of the General\r\nAssembly as the chief deliberative, policy-\r\nmaking and representative organ of the United\r\nNations”. (resolution 55/2, para. 30)\r\nBut our main point is not to join in the lamentations\r\nover the General Assembly’s loss of a leading role. We\r\nbelieve that strengthening one organ does not\r\nnecessarily have to be at the expense of the other. In\r\nother words, this is not a zero-sum game. Putting an\r\nend to the present situation undoubtedly requires, inter\r\nalia, reform of both the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly itself, and also of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nBut while agreements are being reached on such\r\ndelicate matters, we can at least strengthen the few\r\nlinks that already exist between these organs. Among\r\nthe links between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, the most visible are the increasingly\r\nfrequent, though still insufficient, open meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council, despite their shortcomings, which\r\nAmbassador Kamalesh Sharma of India recalled\r\nyesterday. The annual report falls into the same\r\ncategory, at least hypothetically. That is why our\r\ndisappointment with this year’s report is not limited to\r\nits lack of analysis; we are disappointed because of yet\r\nanother missed opportunity to make our main organs\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nwork better and in a coordinated manner. Moreover, the\r\nreport contributes to the image of a forum that lacks\r\ntransparency, but has power, vis-à-vis another forum\r\nthat acts with greater transparency, but has little\r\ncapacity to influence the decision-making process.\r\nTherefore, this is no trivial matter, and that is\r\nwhy we have ventured to intervene at this late stage to\r\nadd our voice to the demand that such a sterile exercise\r\nnot be repeated. If we truly want to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations, we must find a way to make all the\r\nintergovernmental forums function, each in its own\r\nsphere of competence, coherently or at least in a\r\ncoordinated manner.\r\nMr. Al-Malki (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): Like\r\nmy colleague, the Ambassador of Uganda, I extend my\r\nthanks and appreciation to Ambassador Richard Ryan,\r\nthe President of the Security Council for this month,\r\nfor his presentation of the report of the Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI join my colleague, the Ambassador of\r\nGuatemala, in responding to the call by the\r\nAmbassador of Singapore for delegations to make their\r\nopinions and viewpoints known on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, since my delegation was honoured\r\nand privileged to be a member of the Council from\r\n1998 to 1999.\r\nThe discussion of this item is particularly\r\nimportant because, as one of the main organs of the\r\nUnited Nations — along with the General Assembly,\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and others — the\r\nSecurity Council is entrusted with the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, as is clear from its\r\ntitle, in accordance with the Charter. The task entrusted\r\nto the Council gives it and its members serious\r\nresponsibilities that they must bear and carry out on\r\nbehalf of the general membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nDespite the important role that the Council plays\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nits current work has not been at the desired level. The\r\nCouncil continues to be handicapped when it comes to\r\nmany of the issues on its agenda.\r\nIn Africa, bitter wars continue to kill innocent\r\ncivilians in Rwanda, Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone and\r\nother countries. While the Council’s response and\r\neffectiveness were not adequate for the magnitude of\r\nthese events, the same is true of the conflict in the\r\nMiddle East, where the Council has failed to\r\nimplement the resolutions that it itself adopted and\r\nthat, if implemented, would have put an end to the\r\nkilling and the confiscation by Israelis of Palestinian\r\nand other Arab territories occupied since 1967. The\r\nfailure of the Council to find a permanent solution to\r\nthis question is proof of the paralysis and inactivity of\r\nthis main organ of the United Nations.\r\nThe main reason for this failure is the absence of\r\nreal political will on the part of some of its members\r\nand the fact that they impede the work of the Council.\r\nThis impediment goes so far as the exercise of the\r\npower of the veto. This paralysis has an adverse impact\r\non the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nOn the other hand, the Security Council has\r\nfrequently, and to a great extent, resorted to sanctions\r\nsince 1990. During the last 11 years, it has been clear\r\nthat this instrument is in dire need of periodic review in\r\norder to avoid the negative and adverse impact of\r\nsanctions regimes on innocent civilians, particularly\r\nthe elderly, children and women. We believe that the\r\nCouncil should conduct an in-depth and comprehensive\r\nstudy of sanctions regimes, in cooperation with other\r\nUnited Nations bodies and the Organization’s relevant\r\nspecialized agencies. The Council should take rapid\r\nand effective measures towards adopting a more valid\r\nregime that will have no adverse impact on innocent\r\ncivilians.\r\nDue to the fact that the role of the Security\r\nCouncil is acquiring increasing importance —\r\nparticularly since the end of the cold war — and given\r\nthe successive changes in international politics, the\r\nemergence of new issues and the increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations from 50 States, in\r\n1945, to 189 States in 2001, there is a need to carry out\r\na comprehensive reform of the Council — in its size\r\nand working methods. Such changes should make the\r\nCouncil more balanced, representative, transparent and\r\neffective. We will discuss this issue in detail during the\r\ndebate on the relevant item to discuss the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform, which was established by the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn closing, I would like to say that the minor\r\nchanges the Security Council has made in its working\r\nmethods during recent years to bring about more\r\ntransparency — particularly for Member States that are\r\nnot members of the Council — are not up to our\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nexpectations of changes that would have a substantial\r\nand positive effect on the results of the Council’s work.\r\nWe therefore hope that the Council will redouble its\r\nefforts and consider making radical changes in its\r\nworking methods so that it is no longer fossilized and\r\ncan no longer be described as a private country club\r\nopen only to its permanent members.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like future reports\r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly to be\r\nmore analytical and to contain creative proposals and\r\nideas on which delegations could present their views\r\nand carry out a discussion.\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): At the outset,\r\nallow me to express my appreciation to Ambassador\r\nRichard Ryan, Permanent Representative of Ireland and\r\ncurrent President of the Security Council, for his lucid\r\nintroduction of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil covering the period from 16 June 2000 to 15\r\nJune 2001. Taken as a whole, the statistics detailed in\r\nthe report convey a picture of the busy schedule that\r\nthe Council followed during the period under review.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the Council’s focus on\r\npeacekeeping and its comprehensive approach to\r\ndealing with the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, for which it has the primary\r\nresponsibility. We are particularly encouraged by the\r\nfact that the Council paid particular attention to\r\nconflict prevention, resolution and management,\r\nespecially in Africa. We would like to urge the Council\r\nto continue to focus its attention on these issues, given\r\nthe gravity, complexity and multifaceted nature of the\r\nproblems and conflicts bedevilling the continent and\r\nthe need for peace and security, which are prerequisites\r\nfor promoting development and stability.\r\nWithin this context, we welcome the\r\nconsultations that the Council has of late initiated with\r\nregional institutions, and we would like to encourage\r\nthe Council to stay on course. We are of the firm\r\nconviction that partnership with subregional and\r\nregional organizations like the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) could go a long\r\nway in helping to find lasting solutions to the\r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts in\r\nAfrica.\r\nWe have also noted that during the year under\r\nreview the Council undertook missions to some of the\r\nconflict areas. We think this is a useful approach to the\r\nCouncil’s work, since such visits would enable the\r\nCouncil to make informed decisions. In this vein, the\r\nexamination of the general situations in West Africa in\r\nthe light of the report of the visit there by the United\r\nNations Inter-Agency Mission, for example, was a step\r\nin the right direction.\r\nI further wish to emphasize that my delegation\r\nconsiders the interactive consultative process between\r\nthe Council, the Secretariat and troop-contributing\r\nMember States an integral part of the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process that allows for objectivity and\r\ntransparency. Although the report makes reference to\r\nbriefings given by the Secretariat, it does not contain\r\nany detailed references to this consultative process,\r\nwhich, in our view, should have been included in the\r\nreport. Even if this is a new process, we would have\r\nappreciated an assessment of how useful it has been.\r\nWe would like to stress, however, that\r\nconsultations with regional and subregional players\r\nneed not be held on the eve of the expiry or\r\nconsideration of the mandate of peacekeeping\r\noperations in the areas concerned, but rather earlier, if\r\nthe concerns of the regional players are really to be\r\ntaken into account in the decisions of the Council.\r\nMy delegation has other misgivings about the\r\nformat, structure and content of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Council’s current report, like\r\npreceding ones, is a mere compilation of the numerous\r\ndecisions and communications addressed to the\r\nSecurity Council and of the decisions adopted by it —\r\ninformation already in the public domain. One looks in\r\nvain in the report for any analysis of the factors that\r\ninfluenced the decisions of the Council in its\r\ndeliberations. There is no mention of the failures of the\r\nCouncil and the prospects for the ensuing year. Our\r\nassessment of the Council’s work can be meaningful,\r\nbalanced and objective only if the reports submitted by\r\nit to the General Assembly are comprehensive and\r\nanalytical and provide Member States with a clear\r\npicture of how the Council is able to discharge, or is\r\nnot able to discharge, its primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe are convinced that under Article 24 the\r\nSecurity Council is accountable to the General\r\nAssembly, and it is only when the Council’s reports are\r\nprepared along the lines requested annually by Member\r\nStates that the General Assembly, as the United\r\nNations organ with universal membership, can exercise\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.28\r\nits oversight functions. If the Security Council\r\ncontinues to adopt resolutions as edicts that all Member\r\nStates are expected to implement scrupulously — such\r\nas resolution 1373 (2001) — then it is only fitting and\r\nproper that it should explain its actions fully to the\r\ngeneral membership in order to attain the latter’s\r\nsupport, understanding and cooperation —\r\nindispensable ingredients in a genuine search for\r\ninternational peace, security and development.\r\nAs we all know, the report is submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly by the Security Council in\r\naccordance with Article 24, paragraph 3, and Article\r\n15, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nOur understanding of the spirit and the letter behind\r\nthose Articles of the Charter is that through its report\r\nthe Security Council is, in effect, rendering an account\r\nof its stewardship to the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations through the General Assembly. In the\r\nlight of the creeping jurisdiction of the Security\r\nCouncil into areas that lie outside its mandate — which\r\nis a matter of concern — we would like to underscore\r\nthe imperative need to build trust and confidence\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, as well as between the Security Council and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council, since such a\r\nrelationship is pertinent to the Council’s effective\r\ndischarge of its Charter obligations.\r\nEfforts to this end would enhance the solemn\r\nundertaking given by our heads of State or Government\r\nat the Millennium Summit just last year to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. We recognize that such\r\ncollaboration is not only absolutely necessary, but\r\nwould also prove beneficial to both organs.\r\nWe remain convinced that some of the problems\r\ncurrently encountered by the general membership in its\r\ndealings with the Security Council would best be\r\nsolved through more openness, transparency and\r\nconsultation between members and non-members of the\r\nCouncil. A viable and realistic option would be to\r\nensure the rapid expansion of and better representation\r\non the Council. It is our fervent hope that this will be\r\nspeedily done after years of discussion.\r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and\r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic on their election to the\r\nSecurity Council. I trust that the new members will\r\nwork in concert with the other members to resolve the\r\ngrowing demand by the majority of States Members of\r\nthe United Nations for equitable representation on and\r\ntransparency in the Council.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the\r\nreport of the Security Council, as contained in\r\ndocument A/56/2?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: We have concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 11.\r\nI thank all representatives for their full\r\ncooperation, and I hope that this cooperation will\r\ncontinue in future meetings.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers of the following addition and change to the\r\nprogramme of work of the General Assembly. On\r\nWednesday, 21 November 2001, in the morning, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will take up, as the second item,\r\nagenda item 36, “Zone of peace and cooperation of the\r\nSouth Atlantic”.\r\nAgenda item 17 (g), “Appointment of members of\r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit”, originally scheduled for\r\nThursday, 1 November 2001, will be taken up on\r\nMonday, 10 December, in the morning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.55 p.m.\r\n"
