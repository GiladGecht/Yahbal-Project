(Republic of Korea)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Sharma\r\n(Nepal), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother elections\r\n(b) Election of twenty-nine members of the\r\nGoverning Council of the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme\r\nThe Acting President: Pursuant to General\r\nAssembly decision 43/406, the Assembly will proceed\r\nto the election of twenty-nine members of the\r\nGoverning Council of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, to replace those members whose term of\r\noffice expires on 31 December 2001.\r\nThe twenty-nine outgoing members are: Antigua\r\nand Barbuda, Argentina, Austria, Belarus, Belgium,\r\nBotswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, China, the\r\nComoros, Cuba, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia,\r\nJamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malawi, Nigeria, Norway,\r\nthe Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, the\r\nSudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United States of\r\nAmerica, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-\r\nelection.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1\r\nJanuary 2002, the following States will still be\r\nmembers of the Governing Council: the Bahamas,\r\nBenin, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark,\r\nEgypt, Equatorial Guinea, the Gambia, India, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Italy, the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, the Marshall Islands, Mexico, the\r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, the\r\nRepublic of Moldova, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal,\r\nSlovakia, Suriname, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda and the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nTherefore, those 29 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nAs members know, in accordance with rule 92 of\r\nthe rules of procedure, all elections shall be held by\r\nsecret ballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nHowever, I should like to recall paragraph 16 of\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, whereby the\r\npractice of dispensing with the secret ballot for\r\nelections to subsidiary organs when the number of\r\ncandidates corresponds to the number of seats to be\r\nfilled should become standard, unless a delegation\r\nspecifically requests a vote on a given election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that\r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that\r\nbasis?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Regarding candidatures, I\r\nhave been informed by the Chairmen of the regional\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\ngroups that for the eight seats from the African States,\r\nthe eight endorsed candidates are: Chad, the Congo,\r\nKenya, Namibia, Nigeria, the Sudan, Zambia and\r\nZimbabwe.\r\nFor the six seats from the Asian States, the six\r\nendorsed candidates are: China, Indonesia, Japan,\r\nMyanmar, the Republic of Korea and the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic.\r\nFor the three seats from the Eastern European\r\nStates, the three endorsed candidates are: the Czech\r\nRepublic, Romania and the Russian Federation.\r\nFor the Latin American and Caribbean States, the\r\nfive endorsed candidates for the five seats are Antigua\r\nand Barbuda, Argentina, Cuba, Nicaragua and\r\nUruguay.\r\nFor the seven seats from the Western European\r\nand other States, the seven endorsed candidates are\r\nBelgium, Canada, France, Germany, Greece,\r\nSwitzerland and the United States of America.\r\nSince the number of candidates endorsed by the\r\nAfrican States, the Asian States, the Eastern European\r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean States and\r\nthe Western European and other States corresponds to\r\nthe number of seats to be filled in each region, may I\r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to elect those\r\ncandidates as members of the Governing Council of the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme for a four-\r\nyear term of office beginning on 1 January 2002?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The following 29 States\r\nhave thus been elected members of the Governing\r\nCouncil of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme for a four-year term of office beginning on\r\n1 January 2002: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina,\r\nBelgium, Canada, Chad, China, the Congo, Cuba, the\r\nCzech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Indonesia,\r\nJapan, Kenya, Myanmar, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria,\r\nthe Republic of Korea, Romania, the Russian\r\nFederation, the Sudan, Switzerland, the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic, the United States of America, Uruguay,\r\nZambia and Zimbabwe.\r\nI congratulate the States which have been elected\r\nmembers of the Governing Council of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (b)\r\nof agenda item 16.\r\n(c) Election of seven members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/56/399)\r\nThe Acting President: Pursuant to General\r\nAssembly decision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the\r\nAssembly elects the members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination upon their nomination by\r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/56/399,\r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee\r\nthat will occur as a result of the expiration on 31\r\nDecember 2001 of the terms of office of Benin, China,\r\nthe Comoros, Egypt, Japan, the Republic of Korea and\r\nUruguay.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-\r\nelection.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1\r\nJanuary 2002, the following States will still be\r\nmembers of the Committee: Argentina, the Bahamas,\r\nBangladesh, Botswana, Brazil, Cameroon, Cuba,\r\nFrance, Gabon, Germany, Indonesia, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Italy, Mauritania, Mexico, Pakistan,\r\nPeru, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Moldova, the\r\nRussian Federation, San Marino, Ukraine, the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, the United States of\r\nAmerica and Zimbabwe.\r\nTherefore, those 27 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the\r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic\r\nand Social Council. The three African States for three\r\nvacancies are Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tunisia. The three\r\nAsian States for three vacancies are: China, Japan and\r\nthe Republic of Korea. The one Latin American and\r\nCaribbean State for one vacancy is Uruguay.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot\r\nand there shall be no nominations. However, I should\r\nlike to recall paragraph 16 of General Assembly\r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing\r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs\r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard,\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a\r\ngiven election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that\r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that\r\nbasis?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The number of States\r\nnominated from among the African States, the Asian\r\nStates and the Latin American and Caribbean States is\r\nequal to the number of seats to be filled in each of\r\nthose groups.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto declare those States nominated by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council from among the African States, the\r\nAsian States and the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates — namely, China, Ethiopia, Japan, Nigeria, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Tunisia and Uruguay — elected\r\nmembers of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination for a three-year term of office beginning\r\non 1 January 2002?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I congratulate the States\r\nthat have been elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination.\r\nWe have thus concluded our consideration of sub-\r\nitem (c) of agenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs\r\nand other appointments\r\n(h) Appointment of members of the Committee on\r\nConferences\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/56/108)\r\nThe Acting President: As indicated in document\r\nA/56/108, since the terms of office of Algeria, Austria,\r\nJamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Nepal and the United States of\r\nAmerica will expire on 31 December 2001, it is\r\nnecessary for the President of the General Assembly to\r\nappoint, during the current session, seven members to\r\nfill the resulting vacancies. The members so appointed\r\nwill serve for a period of three years beginning on 1\r\nJanuary 2002.\r\nAfter consultations with the Chairmen of the\r\nGroups of African States, Asian States, Latin American\r\nand Caribbean States and Western European and other\r\nStates, the President has appointed Austria, Ethiopia,\r\nJamaica, Jordan, Nepal, Tunisia and the United States\r\nof America as members of the Committee on\r\nConferences, with effect from 1 January 2002.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nthese appointments?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 17?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 31\r\nUniversity for Peace\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/314)\r\nDraft resolution (A/56/L.4)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/56/L.4.\r\nMr. Niehaus (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the Dominican Republic, El Salvador,\r\nGuatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and my\r\ncountry, Costa Rica, I have the honour to introduce the\r\ndraft resolution on agenda item 31, entitled “University\r\nfor Peace”. This draft resolution appears in document\r\nA/56/L.4. I also have the pleasure to state that the\r\nfollowing delegations have decided to join the list of\r\nsponsors: Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Bolivia,\r\nCanada, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, the Congo,\r\nCroatia, Greece, Guyana, India, Paraguay, the\r\nPhilippines, the Russian Federation and Venezuela.\r\nOn 5 December 1980, the General Assembly\r\nestablished the University for Peace as an institution of\r\nhigher education devoted to training in academic\r\ndisciplines conducive to peaceful relations between\r\npeople and nations. It was determined that its main\r\npurpose would be the promotion of peace through the\r\ndissemination of the principles enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. The University therefore endeavours to\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\npromote peace and prevent conflicts through the\r\ncreation of an atmosphere of mutual respect and\r\nrejection of violence among all persons.\r\nThe founders of the University recognized, with\r\nvision, that the first step towards peace is the education\r\nof children and youth, since only through education can\r\nthe excesses of destruction and conflict be replaced by\r\nthe virtues of peace, tolerance and cooperation. The\r\nprogrammatic basis of the University therefore\r\nrevolves around the promotion of peace, education,\r\ncommunication, agreement and human rights. Its work\r\nseeks to collaborate with the United Nations in the\r\nfulfilment of its fundamental aims: the search for peace\r\nand security, sustainable development and respect for\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe conceptual framework of action of the\r\nUniversity recognizes that peace is threatened by many\r\nfactors and that it is necessary to confront the deep\r\nstructural causes of conflicts. It is clear that real\r\nsustainable peace can be attained only when decent\r\nliving conditions for all people are guaranteed, when\r\nthere is a level of economic development that is\r\nadequate to allow them to satisfy their basic needs,\r\nwhen their fundamental rights are respected and when\r\nsocial and political differences are resolved through\r\ndemocratic avenues, dialogue and negotiation. Thus,\r\nthe University teaches that respect for human dignity\r\nand the search for the common good are indispensable\r\nrequirements for peace.\r\nAs the Secretary-General points out in his report,\r\nthe University is currently going through a period of\r\nrehabilitation and reform with a view to fully carrying\r\nout its mandate. In this effort, important advances have\r\nbeen made regarding the restructuring of its\r\nadministration, the development of a broad academic\r\nbasis and the design of educational, training and\r\nresearch programmes in areas related to peace. We\r\nhave also expanded its programmes to all regions of the\r\nworld, thanks to association agreements with other\r\neducational institutions in both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nFurther, the University is actively contributing to\r\nthe implementation of the Programme of Action on a\r\nCulture of Peace. It has strengthened its bonds of\r\ncooperation with other United Nations organizations,\r\nsuch as the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nThe draft resolution reviews the University’s\r\nwork over the last two years. Its preamble underscores\r\nthe various programmes of the University aimed at\r\ncreating a culture of peace in Central America and the\r\nCaribbean in the context of the efforts carried out by\r\nthe United Nations and the Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action for a Culture of Peace. It indicates the\r\nemphasis that the University has placed on the\r\nprevention and peaceful solution of conflicts. It\r\nrecognizes its educational efforts in training for\r\ndemocracy and consensus, as well as respect for\r\ntechniques for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThe draft resolution also emphasizes the\r\nsymposium on the International Year of Older Persons\r\nheld in 1999 which recognized the contribution that\r\nolder persons can make to the promotion of peace,\r\nsolidarity and tolerance. In the operative part, the draft\r\nresolution takes note of the Secretary-General’s report\r\nand requests him to study the possibility of making use\r\nof the University’s services in his conflict-resolution\r\nand peace-building efforts. Similarly, he is requested to\r\nmake use of the University in his work in the\r\ndissemination and implementation of the Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action for a Culture of Peace.\r\nThe draft resolution invites Member States,\r\nintergovernmental bodies and non-governmental\r\norganizations to contribute to the University budget\r\nand to the Trust Fund for Peace. In addition, Member\r\nStates are called upon to accede to the International\r\nAgreement for the Establishment of the University for\r\nPeace, thus demonstrating their support for the\r\ninstitution.\r\nFinally, the draft calls upon States to\r\ncommemorate One Day of Peace on 1 January 2002,\r\nand every year thereafter.\r\nPeace requires firm and continuing commitment.\r\nThe University for Peace makes that commitment\r\neffective through concrete and effective actions in the\r\nbuilding of a true culture of peace. For that reason, we\r\ntrust that this draft resolution will be adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly without a vote.\r\nThe Acting President: Since we have no\r\nspeakers on this agenda item, the General Assembly\r\nwill now take a decision on draft resolution A/56/L.4.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nBefore proceeding to take action on the draft\r\nresolution, I should like to announce that, since the\r\nintroduction of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors: Andorra, Belgium,\r\nCameroon, Cyprus, Ecuador, Gabon, Ireland, Israel,\r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Monaco, the Republic of\r\nMoldova, Senegal, Spain, Suriname, Tajikistan,\r\nThailand and The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\nA/56/L.4?\r\nDraft resolution A/56/L.4 was adopted (resolution\r\n56/2).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 31?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 28\r\nCulture of peace\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/349)\r\nDraft resolution (A/56/L.5)\r\nThe Acting President: In connection with\r\nagenda item 28, the Assembly has before it a draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/56/L.5.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of\r\nBangladesh to introduce draft resolution A/56/L.5.\r\nMr. Ahsan (Bangladesh): It is with great pleasure\r\nthat I initiate the discussion on agenda item 28 entitled\r\n“Culture of peace”.\r\nWe have in front of us the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the International Decade for a Culture of\r\nPeace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World,\r\nwhich began last year.\r\nI thank the Secretary-General for his useful\r\nreport. It not only records the achievements of the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace in 2000, but\r\nalso provides information on the initiatives that are\r\nbeing taken relating to the launching of the\r\nInternational Decade. Member States, the United\r\nNations, regional organizations and civil society are\r\ninvolved through these efforts in building partnerships\r\nto further strengthen the global movement for a culture\r\nof peace.\r\nWe are rediscovering the values of peace,\r\ntolerance, understanding and solidarity in the aftermath\r\nof the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The\r\ninternational community is faced with a situation where\r\nsecurity can no longer be conceptualized in terms of a\r\ncountry’s defence and intelligence capability — where\r\npeace can no longer be understood as mere absence of\r\nwar.\r\nBroader concepts are necessary to explain and\r\naddress the complex reality of the twenty-first century.\r\nAs a concept, a culture of peace attempts to do just\r\nthat. In a rapidly and deeply changing world, a culture\r\nof peace, to use the Secretary-General’s words,\r\n“provides future generations with values that can\r\nhelp to shape their destiny and enable them to\r\nparticipate actively in constructing a more just,\r\nhumane, free and prosperous society and a more\r\npeaceful world”.\r\nIt is therefore significant that individuals are\r\ntaking the message of a culture of peace to heart. Over\r\n74 million women and men have signed Manifesto\r\n2000, which translates the basic principles of a culture\r\nof peace into the language and behaviours of everyday\r\nlife. The growing commitment of individuals to the\r\nuniversal values of peace reflects what the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) constitution strives to\r\nachieve — that is, to construct defences of peace in the\r\nminds of future generations. This widespread public\r\nawareness campaign initiated during the International\r\nYear should definitely be continued during the Decade.\r\nThe Secretary-General has mentioned that in\r\norder to meet the challenge of promoting a culture of\r\npeace successfully, it must become a priority for the\r\nentire United Nations system. We are happy that\r\nadmirable initiatives to promote a culture of peace have\r\nbeen taken not only by the designated lead agency,\r\nUNESCO, but also by other parts of the United Nations\r\nsystem, most notably the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF) and the University for Peace.\r\nUNESCO has recognized the promotion of a\r\nculture of peace as the expression of its fundamental\r\nmandate. We encourage UNESCO to continue its\r\nimportant role throughout the Decade, as highlighted in\r\nparagraph 32 of the Secretary-General’s report.\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nAt the national level, we need more initiatives to\r\npromote a culture of peace. We agree with the two\r\nmain aspects of the strategy, presented in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, for increasing the engagement\r\nof Member States: education for a culture of peace that\r\nplaces “children at the centre” and the strengthening of\r\nthe global movement by stressing partnerships and new\r\ninformation technologies.\r\nA strong civil society involvement would have a\r\npositive impact on the global movement. Indeed,\r\nseveral major initiatives involving civil society during\r\nthe previous year have been very useful, as the\r\nSecretary-General mentions in his report. We would\r\nencourage civil society to undertake more activities to\r\ncomplement the initiatives of Member States, the\r\nUnited Nations and other global and regional\r\norganizations.\r\nAs in previous years, this year, too, on behalf of\r\nBenin, Chile, El Salvador, Togo and my country,\r\nBangladesh, I am happy to introduce the draft\r\nresolution entitled “International Decade for a Culture\r\nof Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the\r\nWorld, 2001-2010”, this year contained in document\r\nA/56/L.5. In addition, the following countries have\r\njoined the sponsors this morning: Argentina, Belarus,\r\nBurundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Costa Rica, Cuba,\r\nCyprus, Egypt, Gabon, Guyana, India, Madagascar,\r\nMalawi, Morocco, the Philippines, the Republic of\r\nMoldova, the Republic of Korea, the Russian\r\nFederation, Senegal, Suriname, Tajikistan, Thailand,\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nThe draft aims to build on last year’s resolution,\r\nresolution 55/47, in carrying forward the work of the\r\nDecade. A number of preambular and operative\r\nparagraphs have been updated for this purpose, and\r\nthere are four notable additions in this year’s draft.\r\nFirst, in the preambular section, mention is made\r\nof the Millennium Declaration, which calls for the\r\nactive promotion of a culture of peace.\r\nSecondly, the draft resolution takes note of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, and refers to its\r\nparagraph 28, which indicates that each of the 10 years\r\nof the Decade will be marked with a different priority\r\ntheme related to the Programme of Action on a Culture\r\nof Peace.\r\nThirdly, in the operative section, the mass media\r\nare encouraged to be involved in education for a\r\nculture of peace and non-violence, with particular\r\nregard to children and young people, including through\r\nthe planned Culture of Peace News Network (CPNN),\r\nas a global network of Internet sites in many languages.\r\nFinally, again in the operative section, there is a\r\nwelcome for the efforts of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) to continue the communication and\r\nnetworking arrangements established during the\r\nInternational Year for providing an instant update of\r\ndevelopments related to the observance of the Decade.\r\nWe hope that these and other elements contained\r\nin the resolution will receive the support of the entire\r\nUnited Nations membership and that the draft can be\r\nadopted without a vote.\r\nWe would request that the President keep this\r\nitem open, so that the draft resolution may be adopted\r\nwith the widest possible support to reflect the global\r\nsolidarity in promoting a culture of peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nMembers that, in a letter dated 8 October 2001\r\naddressed to the President of the General Assembly, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Ireland to the United\r\nNations, in his capacity as Chairman of the Western\r\nEuropean and other States Group for the month of\r\nOctober, requests that the General Assembly hear in\r\nplenary meeting a statement by the Observer of the\r\nHoly See in the debate on agenda item 28, “Culture of\r\npeace”. Taking into account the importance attached to\r\nthe issue under discussion, it is proposed that the\r\nGeneral Assembly should take a decision on that\r\nrequest.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the\r\nproposal to hear the Observer of the Holy See in the\r\ndebate on agenda item 28, “Culture of peace”?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Andino Salazar (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me to express the satisfaction of my\r\ndelegation at having the opportunity to participate in\r\nthe consideration of agenda item 28, “Culture of\r\npeace”. The Government of El Salvador believes that\r\nthis issue is fundamental to advancing towards the\r\nconstruction of an international environment favouring\r\ninternational peace and security, especially at this\r\nmoment, when the international community faces an\r\nexceptional situation.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nI also wish to express the El Salvador\r\ndelegation’s support for, and complete identification\r\nwith, the intervention on this important item by the\r\nrepresentative of Bangladesh. I will accordingly\r\nconfine my intervention to a few very particular\r\naspects.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador views with\r\nconcern the rapid deterioration of the international\r\nsituation as a direct consequence of the negative effects\r\nof the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11\r\nSeptember. This deterioration is also reflected at the\r\nregional and national levels, which demonstrates, in the\r\nopinion of El Salvador, the enormous interdependency\r\nof all the countries in the world as a result of\r\nglobalization.\r\nIn this respect, it is important to stress that the\r\nneed to implement the commitments made by our heads\r\nof State and Government in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration is now urgent and obvious. It is\r\ncomplemented by the purposes, principles and goals set\r\nforth in the Declaration and Programme of Action on a\r\nCulture of Peace, including, in particular, those related\r\nto peace, disarmament, security, the eradication of\r\npoverty, human rights, democracy and good\r\ngovernment.\r\nEl Salvador also believes it important to dedicate\r\nmore efforts to the active promotion of dialogue,\r\ntolerance and mutual respect among civilizations and\r\npeoples, respect for their beliefs and cultural diversity,\r\nas a fundamental base for building a culture of peace\r\nand thus to reduce the active and potential conflicts in\r\nwhich we are mired.\r\nIn this context, the Government of El Salvador\r\nhas decided to promote an initiative to celebrate the\r\nvalues, purposes and principles in the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace, with a\r\nweek of a culture of peace, from 11 September to 21\r\nSeptember. This initiative is consistent with and\r\ncomplementary to the content of the main draft\r\nresolution on the subject of the International Decade of\r\na Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children\r\nof the World, 2001-2010, introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of Bangladesh, which the delegation of\r\nEl Salvador is honoured to co-sponsor. A copy of the\r\ndraft resolution on the week of a culture of peace was\r\ndistributed to all delegations on Friday, 18 October.\r\nMy delegation would therefore be grateful if item\r\n28 on a culture of peace could be kept open so that\r\ninterested delegations can continue to offer their\r\ncomments on the draft resolution before us and so that\r\nthe General Assembly can take a decision on it as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nTo conclude, allow me to reaffirm the political\r\nwill and commitment of the Government of El\r\nSalvador to continue making the necessary efforts at\r\nthe regional, national and international levels to ensure\r\nthat the purposes, principles and objectives established\r\nin the Declaration and Programme of Action on a\r\nCulture of Peace become an integral part of the\r\nactivities of our Organization, and in particular of its\r\nefforts to maintain international peace and security.\r\nMr. Roshdy (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would\r\nlike at the outset to express our appreciation for the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the International\r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for\r\nthe Children of the World, containing details of the\r\nengagement of Member States, the United Nations\r\nsystem and civil society during the International Year\r\nfor the Culture of Peace.\r\nThe world has never been in greater need of the\r\nculture of peace than it is today. In a rapidly and deeply\r\nchanging world, a culture of peace provides future\r\ngenerations with values that can help to shape\r\nchildren’s destiny and enable them to participate\r\nactively in a more just, humane and prosperous society\r\nand a more peaceful world in which the march of peace\r\ngoes on to the benefit of all children.\r\nWith respect to the Secretary-General’s report, I\r\nwould like to stress and fully support the reference to\r\nthe priority placed on education for a culture of peace\r\nand non-violence at all levels. We believe that this\r\nshould be accompanied by teaching children and youth\r\nthe principles of justice, mutual respect and tolerance\r\nof others, regardless of their colour, sex, race or\r\nreligion.\r\nWe in Egypt have always believed that the option\r\nof peace is much more difficult and courageous to take\r\nthan the option of war. We believe that the option of\r\npeace is a momentous decision that determines\r\ndestinies. Peace is a state of mind that requires an\r\nhonest will and good faith. Without such will and faith,\r\nwords and commitments are meaningless and cannot be\r\ntranslated into deeds, while peace treaties cannot be\r\nimplemented and will remain worthless.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nA great deal has happened since the establishment\r\nof the United Nations 56 years ago. At times, these\r\nevents have brought the world peace and happiness,\r\nwhile at others they have brought terrible catastrophe.\r\nSince the day of the United Nations creation, history\r\nand geography have continued to interact and change.\r\nHistory has redrawn the geographical map of the world\r\nby adding new countries and erasing others, while\r\ngeography has rewritten history when border and\r\nregional disputes have erupted, new wars have been\r\nfought and new lines drawn on the face of Earth. This\r\nis testimony to the premise that history draws\r\ngeography and geography writes history.\r\nThroughout all those changes and fluctuations,\r\nonly the pursuit of peace, independence, stability and\r\ndevelopment has remained the ultimate goal of all\r\npeople. Fate has been merciful to some peoples who\r\nhave managed to achieve peace and stability, while\r\nother peoples still strive to do so and are forced to live\r\nunder the tyranny of ruthless foreign occupation and\r\nwars, at a far remove from the culture of peace and\r\ntranquillity.\r\nOne case in point is that of the people of\r\nPalestine, who have suffered — and I do not say\r\nlived — for more than a half century under a brutal\r\noccupation that violates their basic human rights in an\r\nunprecedented policy of discrimination, displacement\r\nand starvation. The suffering of the people of Palestine\r\nremains a shameful insult in the civilized world in\r\nwhich we live today.\r\nNo community can claim to be an isolated island\r\nof democracy in the dark seas of dictatorship while\r\npractising oppression, torture and targeted\r\nassassinations against unarmed civilians who have\r\ncommitted no crime other than cherishing their\r\ninherent rights to self-determination, the establishment\r\nof their independent State and a life in peace among\r\nother nations.\r\nAs long as the Israeli occupation continues in\r\nPalestine and as long as the Israeli Government\r\nremains committed to its fruitless policy of seeking\r\nsecurity through oppression, combating occupation will\r\nremain an essential legitimate right of the people of\r\nPalestine. Neither they nor any other people can accept\r\nliving as hostages in their own land, prisoners in their\r\nhomes, deprived of their basic rights and subject daily\r\nto starvation, closures, random destruction and\r\ncollective punishment.\r\nMy country, Egypt, was the first to extend the\r\nolive branch and to raise the voice of peace more than\r\na quarter of a century ago and we still hope that, one\r\nday, the people and the Government of Israel will be\r\nable to heed the voice of reason and conscience. We\r\ncall on all parties to cooperate faithfully and justly,\r\nabandon the agonies and misgivings of the past and\r\nlook forward to a better future for all. We call upon all\r\nparties to have the courage to work hard to establish an\r\nenvironment that is safe for all children, Israeli and\r\nPalestinian alike; an environment of peace and\r\nreconciliation, not of war and hatred; an environment\r\nin which the giggles of children, the chats of the\r\nelderly and the sounds of construction — rather than\r\nthe sounds of war, destruction, war planes and guns\r\nand the occupation of cities and the punishment of their\r\ninhabitants — would resound. That is the invitation\r\nwhich Egypt extends. Will anyone accept it?\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the item under discussion is\r\nentitled “International Decade for a Culture of Peace\r\nand Non-Violence for the Children of the World”. This,\r\nindeed, is a fitting title, for it so ably encapsulates our\r\ncommon yearning for peace. The children of the world\r\ndeserve no less than peace, but if they are to live in a\r\nworld devoid of conflict, insecurity and deprivation,\r\nwe must bequeath them a world with a culture of\r\npeace.\r\nWe attach great importance to the International\r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace, for we continue to\r\nwitness newly flaring and some long-standing\r\nconflicts, which claim human lives every day. We see\r\nyoung and fragile democracies being threatened by\r\ninstability and we live through hard-won social and\r\neconomic gains being eroded on our continent by\r\narmed conflict and its many-sided effects.\r\nIn this context, the year 2000 — the International\r\nYear for the Culture of Peace — witnessed not a\r\nconsolidation of peace, but a deepening of the\r\neconomic and social strife of many more people in the\r\nworld at large. We cannot measure the enhancement of\r\nworld peace only by how many armed conflicts we\r\nresolve; rather, we should do so in terms of how many\r\nmore children live on more than $1 a day. Only then\r\nwill the culture of peace permeate human life.\r\nIn our view, the Decade for a Culture of Peace\r\nshould thus reflect a collective commitment by all of us\r\nearnestly to uphold the values of freedom, solidarity\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nand, last but not least, tolerance. We should thus\r\nsucceed in establishing just and lasting peace all over\r\nthe world. The eight areas of the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Decade and their interconnections are important\r\nin that regard. Those areas make the critical link\r\nbetween peace and development and should be at the\r\ncentre of implementation.\r\nWe are considering this item a few days after the\r\nSecretary-General and the United Nations were\r\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize. That recognition\r\nshould serve as a challenge to us all to fully implement\r\nthe Programme of Action for the Decade for a Culture\r\nof Peace. The millions of signatures collected\r\nworldwide are an indication that peace is a common\r\naspiration. The slogan “Peace is in our hands” is a\r\ntruism, for it is up to us all whether peace will reign or\r\nlack of security will prevail. Only the international\r\ncommunity, acting collectively, can make world peace\r\na reality.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report describes the\r\nactivities undertaken during the International Year for\r\nthe Culture of Peace; those activities were inclusive,\r\nand we note the involvement of youth. Namibia is\r\namong the countries in which case studies on peace-\r\nbuilding techniques were undertaken. In addition, the\r\nSecretary-General, in his report, proposes a strategy to\r\nbe followed during the implementation of the purposes\r\nof the Decade. My delegation concurs with the\r\nproposed strategy. In our view, the United Nations Year\r\nof Dialogue among Civilizations offered a broad theme\r\nwhich, inter alia, set the basis and the context for the\r\nannual themes: sustainable economic and social\r\ndevelopment; planning of information and knowledge;\r\nrespect for human rights; and gender equality.\r\nFurthermore, while we agree about the\r\nparticipation of youth as proposed in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, it is Namibia’s view that one of the\r\nremaining five years of the Decade for a Culture of\r\nPeace could focus on youth. We strongly believe that\r\nthe understanding and constant participation and\r\ninvolvement of youth in the Decade’s activities are\r\nindispensable to its successful realization. After all,\r\nthey are the youth of today, but the leaders of\r\ntomorrow, who must carry forward the culture of\r\npeace.\r\nNamibia expresses its thanks and appreciation to\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), the lead agency for the\r\nDecade, for fostering a culture of peace in all its fields\r\nof competence. Let me emphasize that UNESCO will\r\nneed financial support from Member States to carry out\r\nits important tasks. In that context, it is Namibia’s hope\r\nthat all other agencies will work with UNESCO. Here,\r\nthe role played by the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) in the area of peace education is\r\ncommendable. We also support the work of the\r\nUniversity for Peace and call for more financial\r\nsupport for its activities. The contribution and support\r\nof all United Nations agencies are indispensable for the\r\nsuccess of the Decade.\r\nMr. Angara (Philippines): The Philippine\r\ndelegation is happy to be participating in this plenary\r\nmeeting on a culture of peace, particularly since we are\r\ncelebrating the International Decade for a Culture of\r\nPeace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World.\r\nThe Philippine delegation is pleased also to\r\nextend a word of congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the United Nations on\r\nhaving been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThis is the first time I have returned to New York\r\nsince 11 September. New York has always fascinated\r\nme. It has now become the city I most admire. While\r\nthe terrorist attacks were devastating to New York, they\r\nalso dramatized its noble character and the indomitable\r\nspirit of its people. I find it fitting that the General\r\nAssembly is assembled today to speak on a culture of\r\npeace, nearly six weeks after the attacks and while\r\nbombs are falling in Afghanistan. These past few\r\nweeks have shown us how vital peace can be and what\r\nwe must do to preserve it.\r\nThe International Decade for a Culture of Peace\r\nand Non-Violence for the Children of the World\r\nreminds us that we are fighting for peace mainly for\r\nour children’s sake. In every conflict, children are\r\nalways the first, the most innocent, victims. And that is\r\nas true of wars fought with guns and arms as it is of the\r\nwar on global poverty.\r\nIn the Philippines, many of our children have\r\nnever known peace. Our children wage war each day. It\r\nis a silent war they wage: the war on hunger and\r\nmalnutrition. And it is a war our children are losing.\r\nFor us in the Philippines, malnutrition continues to be a\r\nserious problem, along with iron-deficiency anaemia,\r\niodine deficiency and vitamin-A deficiency. Nearly\r\nhalf of all Filipino children are malnourished. One in\r\nthree are moderately to severely underweight. The\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nsilent hunger afflicting those children affects their\r\nmental development. It also results in an alarmingly\r\nhigh school dropout rate. In my country, nearly four out\r\nof 10 students who enrol in first grade do not reach the\r\nsixth grade. Each year, seven out of 100 children drop\r\nout.\r\nOur children roam the streets day and night, rain\r\nor shine, homeless. They rap on car windows and lie\r\nprostrate on sidewalks, begging. In the daytime, we\r\nfind them in mountains of garbage, scavenging for\r\nfood. At night, we see them selling just about anything\r\non the streets, including their bodies.\r\nIf children are the first victims of war, then their\r\ninnocence is the first casualty. In our villages and small\r\ntowns, poor children are just as miserable. They carry\r\nsacks of rice twice their weight. They fetch water for\r\ntheir families from great distances. Some of them work\r\nmore than 12 long hours each day, sometimes abused,\r\nalways underpaid.\r\nChild malnutrition reflects my country’s high\r\nlevels of poverty and underdevelopment. Forty per cent\r\nof all Filipinos live below the poverty line. A total of\r\n28 million Filipinos — more than one in three of the\r\nnation’s population — live on less than 60 United\r\nStates cents a day.\r\nIn my country, there is a strong correlation\r\nbetween poverty, malnutrition and economic\r\nunderdevelopment, on the one hand, and peace and\r\norder, on the other. Through the prism of decades-long\r\ncommunist insurgency and Muslim secessionist\r\nmovements, we Filipinos have learned that true peace\r\ncan be attained only through economic well-being and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIt comes as no surprise, then, that the areas with\r\nthe highest levels of poverty and malnutrition are also\r\nhotbeds of conflict and breeding grounds of unrest in\r\nmy country. Provinces in the southern Philippines have\r\nprevalence rates of malnutrition and poverty higher\r\nthan the already high national average. In the Muslim\r\nautonomous region of Mindanao, 65 percent of the\r\npeople are poor. In central Mindanao, almost 60\r\npercent are poor. These are the hotbeds of my country’s\r\ninsurgents and terrorist groups.\r\nThe children do not know peace because they live\r\nin the midst of hostility. Peace is alien to them because\r\nthey are waging a parallel war against malnutrition and\r\npoverty, and they are losing that war. The simple truth\r\nis that the transition to a culture of peace and non-\r\nviolence requires sustainable economic and social\r\ndevelopment. This is one of the core foundations to\r\npromote a culture of peace for our children. Economic\r\nunderdevelopment — and this includes malnutrition\r\nand poverty — remains the missing link towards peace.\r\nThe United Nations must address the alarming\r\nrates of poverty affecting our children in the\r\ndeveloping world if it wants to attain a culture of peace\r\nfor them. It must forcefully articulate the need to bring\r\nabout economic development — and proper nutrition\r\nfor our children — as an essential element towards\r\npeace-building. We know that peace-building begins at\r\nhome, in our own respective countries. We must remain\r\ncommitted to peace through economic development.\r\nTo the Philippines, the steps we should take are\r\nclear, though difficult to accomplish. We must\r\nmodernize our agricultural sector, on which our\r\neconomy is dependent. We must make quality\r\neducation both accessible and affordable. We must\r\nstimulate economic growth through job creation and\r\ninvestment generation. And we must increase the\r\npackage of social benefits for disadvantaged groups.\r\nBy taking these measures, we acknowledge that the\r\nonly true peace that could ever be attained is one\r\nfounded on economic development and growth.\r\nTo conclude, our children have been held hostage\r\nby poverty for far too long. We must do right by them.\r\nWe must free them from this bondage. May all our\r\nchildren know peace in their time.\r\nMr. Rivas (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwould like to begin by extending special thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for drawing up and presenting\r\ndocument A/56/349, which contains an extensive\r\nreport on the culture of peace. Colombia supports the\r\ndraft resolution submitted on this issue.\r\nThe unanimous decision of the General Assembly\r\nto proclaim 2000 the International Year for the Culture\r\nof Peace, and its proclamation of this decade the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World, signalled the\r\ncourse that the beginning of this new millennium\r\nshould take, in which the culture of peace and rejection\r\nof violence makes inroads into war and intolerance.\r\nMore than ever in the history of humanity — which\r\ntoday is beset by innumerable armed conflicts,\r\nterrorism, the illicit traffic in drugs and arms, the\r\nincreasing displacement of populations, poverty and\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nviolence against children and women — the world\r\nneeds a culture of peace sustained by the values and\r\nprinciples of freedom, justice, order and democracy.\r\nWe must therefore have a culture that makes it\r\npossible always to have recourse to dialogue and\r\npeaceful negotiations to resolve conflicts; a culture that\r\npermits us to learn to live together; and a culture based\r\non respect for life and the promotion and practice of\r\nnon-violence through dialogue, cooperation and\r\neducation. There is no doubt that progress towards the\r\nfull flowering of a culture of peace can be achieved\r\nonly through values, attitudes, behaviour and lifestyles\r\nconducive to the promotion of peace among people and\r\nnations. By its ability to inculcate principles and values\r\nin the minds of men and women of all races, education\r\nconstitutes a fundamental pillar for the building of a\r\nculture of peace on the basis of justice, democracy,\r\nequity, equality, solidarity and freedom.\r\nPermit me to remind the Assembly that the first\r\nGeneral Conference of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), held\r\nin 1946, stated that education constitutes a key\r\ninstrument for building lasting peace. It was through a\r\nColombian initiative, and with the support of\r\nUNESCO, that in October 1999 the Organization of\r\nAmerican States held a meeting of governmental\r\nexperts to draw up a programme on education for peace\r\nin the western hemisphere, which recognized education\r\nas one of the fundamental pillars for promoting peace,\r\npreventing conflict, reducing violence and allowing for\r\nthe development and well-being of our peoples. The\r\nimplementation of this programme entailed beginning\r\nto inculcate the people of our countries with values,\r\nknowledge, beliefs, attitudes and behaviour that would\r\nstrengthen a political culture of peace and democracy.\r\nIn order to achieve the objective of creating a\r\nsolid and lasting culture of peace, we have to promote\r\nan active campaign of education and shaping values —\r\na campaign that entails working out programmes for\r\ntraining teachers and the inclusion of themes\r\nconcerning peace, human rights, non-violence and\r\nvalues like democracy, civic education and tolerance,\r\namong others, in the curricula of all centres of\r\nelementary and higher education. Teachers, parents,\r\npoliticians, journalists, religious groups, those who\r\ncarry out scientific, philosophical, creative and artistic\r\nactivities, leading humanitarian and social workers, and\r\nnon-governmental organizations also play a key role in\r\nthis campaign of education for peace and promoting a\r\nculture of peace. All are called upon to do this work of\r\neducation for building a world where peace reigns.\r\nTo create a culture of peace, a priority task that\r\nthis Organization must undertake, we must eliminate\r\nall forms of discrimination and intolerance; promote\r\nthe development of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms; strengthen democratic institutions; guarantee\r\nfull participation in the development process; eradicate\r\npoverty and illiteracy; reduce inequality among and\r\nwithin nations; promote sustainable economic and\r\nsocial development; respect, promote and protect the\r\nrights of children; eliminate all forms of racism;\r\npromote tolerance and solidarity among civilizations,\r\npeoples and cultures; and promote total respect for the\r\nright of all peoples to self-determination.\r\nColombia welcomed the world mobilization of\r\nUNESCO during the International Year for the Culture\r\nof Peace. The campaign “Let us cultivate peace”\r\nyielded innumerable benefits, as did the cooperation\r\ngiven to it by the networks of institutions associated\r\nwith UNESCO, organizations within the United\r\nNations family and other organizations.\r\nLet this be the occasion to highlight the numerous\r\neducational and social activities of my country to make\r\neffective the mandate for peace contained in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, and particularly to\r\ncreate a true understanding among Colombians of the\r\nsubject. Let us mobilize all citizens in order to achieve\r\na mandate to put an end to violence by opting for\r\npeace.\r\nIndeed, three years ago, 10 million citizens gave\r\nthe President of the Republic a clear and precise\r\nmandate to seek peace through a political resolution of\r\nthe internal conflict. In compliance with that mandate,\r\nthe Government of Colombia has committed itself to a\r\npolicy of sustained peace, convinced that a negotiated\r\nsolution to the internal conflict is an essential\r\nprerequisite to establishing a solid foundation for\r\npeace.\r\nSimilarly, in conjunction with the University for\r\nPeace, my country’s Government has actively joined in\r\nthe efforts to establish a global training and research\r\ncentre dedicated to the solution of conflicts. The\r\nobjective of the centre is to provide a forum for an\r\nexchange of experiences in order to develop new\r\ninitiatives in conflict resolution and the consolidation\r\nof peace, as well as to facilitate a continuous\r\ninterchange between the Governments and civil society\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nof other countries suffering from prolonged violent\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn addition, as part of the celebration of the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace, over 12\r\nmillion Colombians signed Manifesto 2000, thereby\r\ncommitting themselves to putting into practice in their\r\ndaily lives the principles of a culture of peace and non-\r\nviolence. Moreover, a State policy has been drawn up\r\nthrough the “Make Peace” programme, which is headed\r\nby the First Lady of Colombia. That policy is aimed at\r\nrebuilding the social fabric of families and\r\ncommunities in order to prevent domestic violence and\r\nto identify and treat its victims, and thus conforms with\r\nthe idea that peace begins in the home.\r\nOur dream continues to be the end of violence in\r\nColombia. We want the voices of children to be heard\r\nin the peace process; and that their suffering and\r\ncourage, along with that of all others who suffer from\r\nthe effects of war, contribute to the building of a\r\ncountry in which the culture of peace reigns supreme.\r\nThe essential task of the Organization to promote\r\na culture of peace in all spheres is more pertinent than\r\never today. The culture of peace provides future\r\ngenerations with values that will help them to\r\ndetermine their destiny and build a more just, humane,\r\nfree and prosperous society and a more peaceful world.\r\nIn closing, I wish to affirm my country’s\r\nunequivocal commitment to peace. We reiterate the fact\r\nthat peace means establishing the foundation for a\r\nsociety in which social justice, equality, participation\r\nand democracy prevail — a society in which the\r\ninstitution of the family is restored and where the rights\r\nand freedoms of citizens are observed.\r\nIn order to consolidate peace, therefore, it is\r\nnecessary to incorporate peace into our own realities\r\nand into our behaviour as human beings. As stated in\r\nthe UNESCO Constitution,\r\n“since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the\r\nminds of men that the defenses of peace must be\r\nconstructed.” (Constitution of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, preamble)\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): The supreme ideal of humankind\r\nis to build a free and peaceful world in which people\r\ncan live an independent and cultured life. Humankind\r\nhas made continuous efforts to build such a humane\r\nworld, but the world humankind hopes to see still\r\nremains a dream. International society continues to\r\nwitness manifestations of domination — which trample\r\nunderfoot the ideas and cultures of other countries and\r\nviolate their sovereignty — as well as the\r\nultranationalism that belittles, and even antagonizes,\r\nother nations. The objective of the culture of peace is\r\nto create a culture of peaceful coexistence without\r\nrecourse to violence between or among States, social\r\ngroups or individuals.\r\nMan is the master of everything and decides\r\neverything. All cultures, civilizations and material\r\nwealth have been created, and continue to be created,\r\nby man. What is important here is the kind of idea and\r\nconsciousness man possesses. If a man has a peace-\r\nloving idea and a fair mind, he will strive and fight for\r\npeace and justice; whereas if he has a mentality of\r\nhating and rejecting others, he is bound to resort to\r\nunjust acts and, even, violence. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation would like to underline the importance of\r\neducation in fostering the idea of a culture of peace.\r\nThe importance of education in promoting the\r\nculture of peace is well illustrated in the Constitution\r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), which states that\r\n“since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the\r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be\r\nconstructed”. (Constitution of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, preamble)\r\nProper education guides men to establish correct\r\nviews of the world and to give full play to their\r\nindependent ideas and creativity, thus contributing to\r\nthe building of peace in the countries and regions of the\r\nworld. In this regard, my delegation would like to draw\r\nthe Assembly’s attention to an emerging attempt to\r\ninject ideas based on animosity into the education to\r\nchildren, which is against the noble ideals of\r\nhumankind.\r\nAs is already known, the Japanese Government\r\nlast May approved new history textbooks for middle\r\nschool children. These history textbooks can be\r\ncharacterized as distorting and negating the history of\r\nseveral hundreds of years of Japan’s aggression and\r\nexploitation by beautifying and embellishing it as a\r\nhistory of cooperation and assistance.\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nThe textbooks have developed a theory of a threat\r\nemanating from Korea. That theory holds that the\r\nKorean peninsula would become the primary base for\r\nan attack on Japan once it fell under domination of a\r\ncountry hostile to Japan and Japan would then find it\r\ndifficult to defend itself. Japan should therefore\r\nconquer Korea in order to be comfortable.\r\nWith regard to Japan’s imperialistic rule over\r\nKorea, the textbooks state that the\r\n“Japanese government thought it necessary for\r\nthe safety of Japan to annex Korea”\r\nand that\r\n“after the annexation of Korea, Japan conducted\r\nsuch development projects as setting in place\r\nrailways and irrigation facilities in colonized\r\nKorea”.\r\nThe textbooks thus distort the history of aggression and\r\nexploitation as if it were a “history of development and\r\nassistance”.\r\nThey falsified the Pacific war as if it were a\r\n“Great East Asian War” for achieving the “Greater East\r\nAsia Co-prosperity Sphere”, stating that its objective\r\nwas for\r\n“economic development and abolition of racial\r\ndiscrimination through cooperation among Asian\r\ncountries”.\r\nThe textbooks also turned black into white by\r\nmentioning that the defeat of the Allied forces by Japan\r\nin the early stages of the war gave\r\n“courage to the Asian people, who had been\r\nunder the colonial domination of Europe and the\r\nUnited States for a long time”\r\nand that\r\n“the southward advance of the Japanese army\r\nserved as an occasion that accelerated the\r\nindependence of the Asian countries”.\r\nThe textbooks also described the Japanese people\r\nas having experienced the same pain as had been\r\nsuffered by the 6 million Koreans forcibly drafted as\r\nslaves by the Japanese army. As for the Japanese\r\nattempt to eliminate the Korean nation by depriving the\r\nKorean people of their language and names, the\r\ntextbooks watered down the truth by simply stating that\r\nJapan\r\n“demanded that the Korean people give their\r\nnames in Japanese”.\r\nWorse still, they covered up the fact of having forced\r\n200,000 Korean women to become sex slaves and\r\nreferred to them as “comfort women”.\r\nThe Japanese authorities continue to defy the\r\ndemand for full recognition of, and official apology for,\r\ntheir grave crimes against humanity, for punishment of\r\nthe criminals and for due compensation to the countries\r\nand peoples that fell victim.\r\nThe distortions found in history textbooks\r\nrepresent an extension of Japan’s attempt to avoid\r\nmaking amends for past crimes and is a clear\r\nexpression of its desire to revive militarism.\r\nJapanese ultra-rightists are trying to introduce\r\ninto schools history textbooks whose objective is to\r\ninstil ultra-nationalism and national nihilism in the new\r\ngenerations, in order to realize their old dream of an\r\naggressive “Greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere”\r\nand to cover up forever the massive crimes against\r\nhumanity committed by Japan in the past.\r\nIf Japanese children are imbued with the idea of\r\nmilitarism through such distorted education, they will\r\nonce again come to disregard other nations, resort to\r\naggressive actions and thereby undermine peace and\r\nsecurity, inflicting tragic sufferings on humankind.\r\nAs long as the Japanese authorities do not make\r\namends, through practical steps, for the inhumane\r\ncrimes they have committed against other Asian\r\npeoples in the past, Japan will remain the greatest\r\nsource of instability in the Asia and Pacific region.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\ndesires and values peace more highly than any other\r\npeople, given its past and present experiences.\r\nThe Korean nation suffered from Japanese\r\noccupation and exploitation for 41 years, followed by\r\nthe pain of the artificial division of the country by the\r\nUnited States, a division that endures to this day.\r\nMy delegation reaffirms that the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will address with great\r\nresolve any and all challenges to peace in this new\r\ncentury and will fight for lasting peace on the Korean\r\npeninsula and in the rest of the world.\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with the\r\ndecision taken earlier, I now call on the observer of the\r\nHoly See.\r\nArchbiship Martino (Holy See): It is indeed\r\nappropriate that today the General Assembly is\r\naddressing the topic of a culture of peace. The\r\nimperfect peace in which our world had been dwelling\r\nhas suddenly been shattered by violent and senseless\r\nattacks against innocent human beings. An initial\r\nreaction may come in the form of words of war, and\r\nnot in the language of peace, understanding and\r\nreconciliation. Yet institutions such as the United\r\nNations are entrusted with very serious responsibilities.\r\nIndeed, according to Article 1, paragraph 1, of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, one of the purposes of\r\nthe Organization is\r\n“To maintain international peace and security, and\r\nto that end: to take effective collective measures\r\nfor the prevention and removal of threats to the\r\npeace.”\r\nPeace begins within the heart. It is not simply the\r\nabsence of war, nor is it sought only to avoid\r\nwidespread conflict. Rather, it helps to direct our\r\nreasoning and thus our actions towards the good of all.\r\nIt becomes a philosophy of action that makes us all\r\nresponsible for the common good and obliges us to\r\ndedicate all our efforts to its cause. If, for these\r\nreasons, we are convinced that peace in itself is a good\r\nthing, we must build a culture of peace.\r\nPeace is first known and recognized in, and\r\nwilled and loved from, the heart. Then, in order for a\r\nculture of peace to be established, it must be expressed\r\nand impressed on humanity, on its philosophy, its\r\nsociology, its politics and its traditions.\r\nThere are a number of definitions for the word\r\n“culture” which my delegation believes provide us with\r\na good starting point for our discussion today. The first\r\nspeaks of culture as “the art or practice of cultivating”,\r\nwhile another defines it as\r\n“the total pattern of human behaviour and its\r\nproducts embodied in thought, speech, action and\r\nartifacts, and dependent upon man’s capacity for\r\nlearning and transmitting knowledge to\r\nsucceeding generations through the use of tools,\r\nlanguage and systems of abstract thought”.\r\nTogether, both of these definitions seem to\r\nprovide a foundation for a clearer understanding of\r\nculture, and, when placed into the context of today’s\r\ndiscussion, a culture of peace might be seen as\r\n“that pattern of human behaviour which must be\r\ncultivated and transmitted to future generations”.\r\nOnce we have come to an understanding of what\r\na culture of peace is, we can begin to reflect upon ways\r\nin which to communicate that understanding and help it\r\ntake root in the hearts and minds of humanity.\r\nThe establishment of a culture of peace and non-\r\nviolence will necessitate a new language and new\r\ngestures towards peace. In this search, we will not only\r\neducate a new generation; we will also educate\r\nourselves about peace and awaken in ourselves firm\r\nconvictions and a new capacity for taking initiatives in\r\nthe service of the great cause of peace.\r\nEducation for peace and a better understanding\r\nand realization of peace can benefit from renewed\r\ninterest in the everyday examples of simple builders of\r\npeace at all levels — those unsung heroes who we\r\nknow exist all over the world. Our eyes and those of\r\nthe next generation must be focused on a vision of\r\npeace which will nurture the aspiration for peace and\r\nnon-violence, which is an essential part of every human\r\nbeing.\r\nAll of this, of course, is the work that the United\r\nNations and the peoples of the world have been\r\nengaged in for many years. This ongoing process,\r\nhowever, is hampered by many obstacles, which\r\ncontinue to hinder progress towards a true and lasting\r\npeace for all peoples.\r\nSituations of conflict exist in today’s world in\r\nwhich a just solution may have been refused at some\r\ntime by both parties involved. This fosters feelings of\r\nfrustration and hatred as well as the desire for revenge,\r\nto which all must remain attentive. Those who honour\r\nGod must be in the front lines of those who fight\r\nagainst all forms of terrorism. As stated by Pope John\r\nPaul II when he met with religious leaders on 23 March\r\n2000 in Jerusalem, at an inter-religious meeting at the\r\nNotre Dame Pontifical Institute,\r\n“If it is authentic, devotion to God\r\nnecessarily involves attention to our fellow\r\nhuman beings. As members of the one human\r\nfamily and as God’s beloved children, we have\r\nduties towards one another which, as believers,\r\nwe cannot ignore.”\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nHis Holiness touched upon that same idea last\r\nJanuary, when he said, in his message for the\r\ncelebration of the World Day of Peace:\r\n“We all know how hard it is to settle differences\r\nbetween parties when ancient hatreds and serious\r\nproblems which admit of no easy solution create\r\nan atmosphere of anger and exasperation. But no\r\nless dangerous for the future of peace would be\r\nthe inability to confront intelligently the problems\r\nposed by a new social configuration resulting in\r\nmany countries from accelerated migration and\r\nthe unprecedented situation of people of different\r\ncultures and civilizations living side by side.”\r\nActs of revenge will not cure such hatred.\r\nReprisals, which strike indiscriminately at the\r\ninnocent, continue the spiral of violence and are\r\nillusionary solutions that prevent the moral isolation of\r\nterrorists. We must, rather, remove the most obvious\r\nelements that spawn the conditions for hatred and\r\nviolence and that are contrary to any movement\r\ntowards peace. Poverty, along with other situations of\r\nmarginalization that engulf the lives of so many of the\r\nworld’s people, including the denial of human dignity,\r\nlack of respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, social exclusion, intolerable refugee\r\nsituations, internal and external displacement and\r\nphysical or psychological oppression, are breeding\r\ngrounds only waiting to be exploited by terrorists.\r\nAny serious campaign against terrorism also\r\nneeds to address the social, economic and political\r\nconditions that nurture the emergence of terrorism,\r\nviolence and conflict.\r\nIn the midst of this current tragedy and threat to\r\nthe culture of peace, forms of systematic terrorism\r\nshould not be forgotten. In some cases it is almost\r\ninstitutionalized, possibly based on systems which\r\nutterly destroy the freedom and rights of individuals\r\n“guilty” of not bringing their thought into line with the\r\ntriumphant ideology. Today such people are unable to\r\nattract the attention and support of international public\r\nopinion, and they must not be forgotten or abandoned.\r\nIn this light, the world must recognize that there\r\nis hope. Building a culture of peace is not preposterous;\r\nnor is it a utopian dream. It is, rather, an attainable\r\nreality, which, even though just beyond our realization,\r\nis still a worthy and reachable goal.\r\nPope John Paul II has always used the idea of this\r\nsearch for peace as a major theme. His exhortations\r\nhave been repeated especially often during the past two\r\nyears, as part of the celebration of the Great Jubilee of\r\n2000. In a homily during his visit to Jordan, His\r\nHoliness called upon all mothers to be builders of a\r\nnew civilization of love. He said to them,\r\n“Love your families. Teach them the dignity of all\r\nlife; teach them the ways of harmony and peace.”\r\nMore recently, His Holiness told the young\r\npeople of Kazakhstan:\r\n“Know that you are called to be the builders of a\r\nbetter world. Be peacemakers, because a society\r\nsolidly based on peace is a society with a future.”\r\nFinally, I would like to conclude with words of\r\nPope John Paul II, spoken almost 20 years ago, which\r\nseem so appropriate for our discussion today:\r\n“I present to you this message on the theme,\r\nDialogue for peace, a challenge for our time. I\r\nam addressing it to all those who are, on the one\r\nhand, people responsible for peace: those who\r\npreside over the destiny of peoples, international\r\nofficials, politicians, diplomats. But I am also\r\naddressing the citizens of each country. All are in\r\nfact called by the need to prepare true peace, to\r\nmaintain it or to re-establish it, on solid and just\r\nfoundations. Now I am deeply convinced that\r\ndialogue — true dialogue — is an essential\r\ncondition for such peace. Yes, this dialogue is\r\nnecessary, not only opportune. It is difficult, but\r\nit is possible, in spite of the obstacles that realism\r\nobliges us to consider. It therefore represents a\r\ntrue challenge, which I invite you to take up. And\r\nI do this without any other purpose than that of\r\ncontributing, myself and the Holy See, to peace,\r\nby taking very much to heart the destiny of\r\nhumanity, as the heir of the message of Christ and\r\nas the first one responsible for that message,\r\nwhich is above all a message of peace for all\r\nmen.”\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the\r\nright of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\nsecond intervention, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Jacob (Israel): It is most unfortunate that the\r\ndebate on the culture of peace has been used by the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt to inject the rhetoric of\r\nviolence and blind anti-Israeli hatred into this Hall. It\r\nis unfortunate, in particular, because Egypt knows\r\nbetter. Egypt knows full well Israel’s commitment to\r\npeace and its far-reaching compromises, which are\r\nresponded to by violence and terror. Egypt knows, too,\r\nthe price paid in Israeli life as a result of a ruthless\r\nterrorist campaign, which the representative of Egypt\r\nconveniently avoided referring to in his statement.\r\nIndeed, the culture of peace in our region would\r\nbe greatly advanced if Egypt abandoned its tendency to\r\napportion blame and engage in false accusations, and\r\nconcentrated more on its own conduct and on\r\nencouraging democratization and respect for mutual\r\nrights and compromise in its society and among\r\nneighbouring peoples and Governments.\r\nEgypt’s peace with Israel was indeed a historic\r\nand important step for the region as a whole. But a\r\nformal peace treaty is only one part of the equation.\r\nThe culture of peace, as I would hope the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt knows, involves much more\r\nthan that.\r\nMr. Roshdy (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I thank\r\nthe Israeli representative for his concern for democracy\r\nin Egyptian society, but what takes place in Egyptian\r\nsociety is an internal matter and is not the business of\r\nany delegation just as what takes place in Israeli\r\nsociety is an internal matter. What concerns us here are\r\nthe violent Israeli policies against the Palestinians.\r\nThat is not an internal matter.\r\nThe Israeli representative speaks about the causes\r\nof hatred propagated by Egypt against Israel. But Egypt\r\ndoes not need to promote such calls. Israeli policies are\r\nself-evident in that regard, and we leave it to\r\ndelegations to judge if these policies will lead to peace.\r\nThe Israeli people will be the first to benefit from\r\npeace.\r\nMr. Jacob (Israel): The Egyptian representative\r\nreferred to Israel as a democratic State. Israel is indeed\r\na democracy, in a hostile and undemocratic\r\nneighbourhood. It continues to uphold democratic\r\nstandards in the face of relentless violent assault on its\r\nvery existence. Rather than attacking Israel, the\r\nEgyptian representative would be well served by\r\nexamining his own country’s human rights record and\r\nits contribution to fostering a culture of peace. The\r\nofficial Egyptian press spews the vilest forms of anti-\r\nSemitic lies and anti-Jewish stereotypes. Such anti-\r\nSemitic and anti-western propaganda underscores a\r\nculture of hatred, not of peace. Peace is as much a\r\npsychological and emotional affair as a political one.\r\nAs a nation that first recognized that Israel, too, has the\r\nright to live in peace, Egypt should also lead the way\r\ntowards reconciling the hearts and minds of its people\r\nand the peoples of the region to peace with Israel,\r\nrather than stoking the flames of hatred.\r\nMr. Roshdy (Egypt): I am sorry to prolong a\r\ndiscussion that seems fruitless.\r\nPeace is not an expression of meaningless words,\r\ntreaties to be signed and retracted the following day,\r\nceremonial pictures to be taken or toasts to be\r\nexchanged. Rather, peace is the interpretation and the\r\nimplementation of honest goodwill, costly sacrifices\r\ncourageously exchanged and serious commitment to\r\nstriving for enduring peace. Peace begins deep in our\r\nhearts. If our hearts and intentions are in the right\r\nplace, our deeds will be in the right direction and our\r\nactions will be honest and true.\r\nThe difference between peace and settlement is as\r\nobvious as the difference between remedies and\r\ntranquillizers. We cannot promote the culture of peace\r\nbefore the establishment of peace itself. How can we\r\nestablish peace if not all partners believe genuinely in\r\npeace and the need for peace?\r\nI will conclude with a statement that I am sure\r\nwill come as news to the Israeli representative: Israeli\r\nblood is not more precious or purer than Palestinian\r\nblood.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that, at the request of the sponsors, action on\r\ndraft resolution A/56/L.5 will be taken at a later date,\r\nto be announced.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to announce\r\nsome changes to the programme of work of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFirst, I should like to inform the members that\r\nconsideration of agenda item 23, entitled “Building a\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.29\r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic ideal”, originally scheduled for Thursday\r\nafternoon, 25 October 2001, is postponed to Friday, 2\r\nNovember 2001, in the morning.\r\nI should also like to inform members of a matter\r\nconcerning agenda item 15 (b), on the election of\r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nscheduled to take place on Friday, 26 October 2001.\r\nIn connection with this sub-item, I should like to\r\ndraw the attention of members to a latter dated 11\r\nOctober 2001 from the Permanent Representative of\r\nPortugal addressed to the President of the General\r\nAssembly. The letter has been circulated as document\r\nA/56/467.\r\nIn his letter, the Permanent Representative of\r\nPortugal announces that Portugal will relinquish its\r\nseat on the Economic and Social Council for the year\r\n2002, in favour of Spain. Consequently, it will be\r\nnecessary for the Assembly to conduct a by-election to\r\nfill that one vacancy, in accordance with rule 140 of its\r\nrules of procedure.\r\nIn this regard, I should like to inform members\r\nthat on Friday, 26 October, the General Assembly will\r\nfirst conduct a by-election to fill this one vacancy, and\r\nthen proceed to the election of 18 members of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.55 a.m.\r\n"
