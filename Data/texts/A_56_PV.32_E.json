(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of His Excellency Mr. Ismat\r\nKittani, President of the General Assembly at its\r\nthirty-sixth session\r\nThe President: Before we take up the items on\r\nour agenda for this morning, it is my sad duty to inform\r\nmembers of the Assembly of the recent death of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ismat Kittani, a national of Iraq.\r\nMr. Kittani was President of the General\r\nAssembly at its thirty-sixth session in 1981. In\r\naddition, Mr. Kittani was a well-known diplomat who\r\nserved his country in a number of very important\r\npositions.\r\nMr. Kittani also had a long and distinguished\r\ncareer at the United Nations, having served previous\r\nSecretaries-General at various intervals as Assistant\r\nSecretary-General, Chef de Cabinet and Special\r\nAdviser, as well as Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General on some highly sensitive missions.\r\nA skilful diplomat and negotiator, he will be\r\nremembered for his dedication and commitment to the\r\nideals and principles of the United Nations.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I should like\r\nto convey our deepest condolences to the Government\r\nand people of Iraq and to the bereaved family of\r\nMr. Kittani.\r\nI now invite representatives to stand and observe\r\na minute of silence in tribute to the memory of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kittani.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: We have\r\ngathered to pay tribute to an unforgettable member of\r\nour United Nations family. Ismat Kittani was a friend,\r\ncolleague, mentor and inspiration to countless people.\r\nHe was loved by those who knew him, and respected\r\nby all who came in contact with him. For several\r\ndecades our Organization benefited from his wisdom,\r\nexperience and diplomatic skills as well as his human\r\nwarmth and kindness.\r\nBoth in the service of his country and as an\r\nofficial of the United Nations — including a\r\ndistinguished term as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its thirty-sixth session — he was an\r\naccomplished diplomat, combining the discretion of the\r\ninternational civil servant with an intimate knowledge\r\nof the intergovernmental process. He brought skill and\r\njudgement to any assignment, no matter how sensitive.\r\nHe brought professionalism and objectivity to all his\r\nwork, no matter how arduous. Equally important, he\r\nbrought a great deal of warmth and humour to this\r\nHouse.\r\nWhen Ismat Kittani retired from the staff of the\r\nOrganization, he said in his farewell remarks that none\r\nof us is forced to work for the United Nations, that we\r\ndo so because we believe in its ideals. He was someone\r\nwho helped us all sustain that belief, and who made our\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nwork here even more rewarding. As we express our\r\ncondolences today to his family and loved ones, let us\r\nalso give thanks for the example he gave all of us. Let\r\nus be inspired by it as we confront the many challenges\r\nahead.\r\nThe President: I call now on the representative\r\nof the Sudan, who will speak on behalf of the African\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Rahmtalla (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly gathers this morning to eulogize the\r\nlate Ismat Kittani. The record of his life is replete with\r\ndistinguished and abundant diplomatic activity and\r\nachievement. He was the representative of his country,\r\nIraq. He began his long, rich career as a diplomat in the\r\nIraqi Foreign Ministry, and he worked as the\r\nPermanent Representative of his country to the United\r\nNations here in New York and at its European seat in\r\nGeneva. He was a Deputy Foreign Minister of Iraq, and\r\nhad the privilege of presiding over the General\r\nAssembly at its thirty-sixth session.\r\nWe also recall the distinguished performance by\r\nMr. Kittani of his tasks and responsibilities as a\r\ndistinguished, eminent and responsible official of this\r\nOrganization. He was the Chef de Cabinet of five\r\nSecretaries-General. He proved his ability and\r\ndemonstrated distinguished achievement, and he\r\nmanaged to imbue multilateral diplomacy with his\r\nwide experience.\r\nWe on the African continent remember with\r\ngratitude and appreciation Mr. Kittani when he worked\r\nas the Special Representative of the then Secretary-\r\nGeneral to Somalia in 1992, in very sensitive and\r\ncomplicated circumstances.\r\nAs they join the rest of the international family in\r\nconveying its condolences on the death of Mr. Kittani,\r\nthe members of the African Group pray that his soul\r\nmay reside in paradise and ask God to grant patience\r\nand comfort to his family and to his many friends. We\r\nare of God, and to God we return.\r\nThe President: I call now on the representative\r\nof Sri Lanka, who will speak on behalf of the Asian\r\nStates.\r\nMr. De Saram (Sri Lanka): I have the honour on\r\nbehalf of the Asian Group to speak this morning in the\r\nAssembly’s tribute to the life and memory of\r\nAmbassador Ismat Kittani. Although I had the pleasure\r\nof meeting Ambassador Kittani on a few occasions, I\r\nwould not say that I knew him well. But in preparing\r\nmy remarks this morning I spoke to a few who were\r\namong his closest friends. Of his personal qualities,\r\nabove all else, they spoke with feeling of his poise\r\nwithout pretension, his kindness and his humour, of his\r\ndeep personal loyalties and his helpfulness to many.\r\nSome of those with whom I spoke said that they would\r\nnot be where they were today — and, like Ambassador\r\nKittani, they have had distinguished careers at the\r\nUnited Nations — had it not been for the unusually\r\nkind and unexpected assistance they received from\r\nAmbassador Kittani along the way.\r\nHis was an agile, inventive and flexible mind,\r\nthey said: so suitable to what we do at the United\r\nNations. He used to do the New York Times crossword\r\npuzzle every day, a friend recalled. What that friend\r\nmost remembered about Ambassador Kittani was that,\r\nnotwithstanding his elegance, he had the extraordinary\r\nability to speak to everyone in the same direct, simple\r\nway.\r\nAmbassador Kittani’s career at the United\r\nNations was, of course, one of the most distinguished\r\nthere ever was. He served as Permanent Representative\r\nof his country, both at the United Nations Office at\r\nGeneva and at Headquarters here in New York. He had\r\na knowledge of the United Nations system that was\r\nunequalled; he had held more than one high office in\r\nits agencies. He was a close adviser to five Secretaries-\r\nGeneral and Chef de Cabinet to one, and, of course,\r\nwas a former President of the General Assembly.\r\nThere will be few like him, I think, that we shall\r\nmeet in the United Nations community. His was a life\r\nof extraordinary dimension; his service to the United\r\nNations and to its purposes was devoted. Ambassador\r\nKittani will be long remembered at the United Nations,\r\nand there will be many around the world who will be\r\ndeeply saddened to learn that he has now left us.\r\nTo Ambassador Mohammed A. Aldouri and to his\r\ncolleagues in the delegation of Iraq, and, through\r\nAmbassador Aldouri to the family of Ambassador\r\nKittani, I wish on behalf of all the members of the\r\nAsian Group to convey the deepest sympathy.\r\nThe President: I call now on the representative\r\nof Georgia, who will speak on behalf of the Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nMr. Volski (Georgia): As Chairman of the Group\r\nof Eastern European States for the month of October, I\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nshould like to express our deep sorrow at the passing of\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ismat Kittani, who served as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth\r\nsession. We share with his family, with his friends,\r\nwith the people of Iraq and with the United Nations\r\ngrief at the loss of a distinguished diplomat and United\r\nNations official who worked tirelessly to bring peace\r\nand prosperity to his people as well as to the people of\r\nSomalia, whom he served during his tenure as Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Somalia.\r\nAs President of the General Assembly at its\r\nthirty-sixth session, Mr. Kittani demonstrated\r\noutstanding leadership in guiding the work of the\r\nAssembly through the complex challenges of the cold-\r\nwar era. He will always be remembered for his vision\r\nand for his dedication to making that vision come true.\r\nThe President: I call now on the representative\r\nof Haiti, who will speak on behalf of the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Lelong (Haiti) (spoke in French): It is my\r\nsad duty today, on behalf of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, to request the\r\nPermanent Mission of Iraq to the United Nations to\r\ntransmit to its Government, to its people and to the\r\nbereaved family our sincere condolences and deep\r\nsympathy on the death of His Excellency Mr. Ismat\r\nKittani. It is fitting that the General Assembly is\r\npaying homage to the memory of a citizen who not\r\nonly served his country in an exemplary manner in\r\nvarious posts in its Ministry of Foreign Affairs —\r\nincluding as Under-Secretary and as Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Iraq to the United Nations — but was\r\nalso distinguished by his tangible contribution to the\r\nprestige and the success of the United Nations, where\r\nin the course of his long career he served, inter alia, as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth\r\nsession, as Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Somalia and Chef de Cabinet to the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nHis was a life of dedication, responsibility and\r\nsuccess. May his soul rest in peace.\r\nThe President: I call now on the representative\r\nof Ireland, who will speak on behalf of the Western\r\nEuropean and other States.\r\nMs. Murnaghan (Ireland): On behalf of the\r\nGroup of Western European and other States, I wish to\r\nadd our voice to the expressions of appreciation offered\r\nhere today with respect to the life and memory of Ismat\r\nKittani. Mr. Kittani had a distinguished career at the\r\nUnited Nations. He is remembered for his distinguished\r\nservice in the General Assembly, where he served both\r\nin front of the podium and behind it. He was President\r\nof the General Assembly during its thirty-sixth session,\r\nand he also served the United Nations as director of the\r\nexecutive office of Secretary-General U Thant and as\r\nChef de Cabinet to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim.\r\nIn all, Mr. Kittani served five Secretaries-General and\r\nwas entrusted by them with many sensitive missions.\r\nParticular mention should be made of his role as\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nSomalia in the early 1990s and as Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General to the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, held at Beijing in 1995.\r\nHe fulfilled those roles with great distinction.\r\nWe extend our sincere condolences to his family\r\nand his friends, and ask also that the condolences of the\r\nGroup of Western European and other States be\r\nconveyed, by the Mission of Iraq, to the Government\r\nand the people of Iraq.\r\nThe President: I call now on the representative\r\nof the United States of America.\r\nMs. Marcus (United States of America): On\r\nbehalf of the United States, in sympathetic solidarity\r\nwith our friends and colleagues in the United Nations\r\ncommunity, I come before the Assembly to honour the\r\nmemory of the late Assistant Secretary-General, Ismat\r\nKittani, the thirty-sixth President of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Kittani was a respected international\r\ndiplomat, known for his commitment to the United\r\nNations over a long and distinguished career. He made\r\nimportant contributions to the United Nations\r\nSecretariat as Secretary of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil; Director of the Executive Office of the\r\nSecretary-General; Deputy to the Assistant Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Inter-Agency Affairs; and Assistant\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThat Mr. Kittani diligently sought peace and well-\r\nbeing for the nations of the world is clearly evidenced\r\nby his work with the World Health Organization, the\r\nWorld Health Assembly and the International Labour\r\nOrganization, and as President of the Second Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nThe United States mourns the loss of the\r\ndistinguished diplomat Mr. Ismat Kittani, and honours\r\nhis commitment to the noble aims of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I should\r\nlike at the outset to thank you, Mr. President, for giving\r\nus this opportunity to pay tribute, here in the General\r\nAssembly Hall, to the memory of the late Mr. Ismat\r\nKittani.\r\nThe late Mr. Ismat Kittani was one of a small\r\nnumber of distinguished Iraqi citizens who served their\r\ncountry in many capacities. He began his career in\r\n1952 in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iraq, where\r\nhe became well known, and is still remembered, for\r\nnoble qualities and for his important, distinguished\r\nwork. Mr. Kittani continued to be promoted within the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, becoming Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Iraq to the European Office of the\r\nUnited Nations in Geneva, as well as representing Iraq\r\nat Headquarters here in New York. He achieved the\r\nposition of Deputy Foreign Minister of Iraq,\r\nrepresented the Iraqi Government in many international\r\nactivities and was nominated by the Iraqi Government\r\nfor the position of President of the General Assembly\r\nat its thirty-sixth session in 1982.\r\nIt is well known that the late Mr. Kittani was an\r\noutstanding President of the General Assembly, and\r\nmade a lasting impression on the delegations of many\r\ncountries, as well as in the Secretariat. It is also well\r\nknown that the late Mr. Kittani held very important\r\npositions in the Secretariat of the Organization,\r\nrepresenting the Secretary-General on important and\r\nspecial international missions. He will be remembered\r\nfor the unique characteristics of his personality and his\r\ndiplomatic and great social skills. He believed fully in\r\nthe United Nations and its noble and lofty objectives.\r\nIn paying tribute to Mr. Kittani’s memory, the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General referred to his many\r\npersonal qualities, and I would like to extend my\r\ngratitude and thanks to the Deputy Secretary-General\r\nfor her eulogy.\r\nIn conclusion, I thank all those who have offered\r\ncondolences to the Permanent Mission of Iraq to the\r\nUnited Nations in New York and to me personally.\r\nAgain, I thank you, Mr. President, for this tribute. May\r\nGod Almighty have mercy on the late Mr. Kittani and\r\npreserve his soul. Verily, we are unto God and to Him\r\nwe return.\r\nThe President: That concludes our tribute to the\r\nmemory of His Excellency Mr. Ismat Kittani, President\r\nof the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session.\r\nAgenda item 15 (continued)\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic\r\nand Social Council\r\nThe President: For the record, the complete\r\nresults of the round of balloting held at the 31st plenary\r\nmeeting on Friday, 26 October 2001, to elect 18\r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council are as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 177\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 177\r\nAbstentions: 4\r\nNumber of members voting: 173\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 116\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBurundi 170\r\nGhana 168\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya 163\r\nZimbabwe 162\r\nZambia 2\r\nCongo 1\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo 1\r\nGabon 1\r\nGambia 1\r\nGroup B — Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 177\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 176\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 176\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 118\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBhutan 146\r\nIndia 145\r\nQatar 142\r\nChina 134\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea 64\r\nMyanmar 56\r\nIndonesia 1\r\nLebanon 1\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 177\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 176\r\nAbstentions: 3\r\nNumber of members voting: 173\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 116\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nHungary 170\r\nUkraine 168\r\nRussian Federation 161\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia 3\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 177\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 177\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 177\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 118\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nChile 140\r\nEl Salvador 135\r\nGuatemala 125\r\nHaiti 108\r\nEcuador 3\r\nGrenada 1\r\nNicaragua 1\r\nPanama 1\r\nTrinidad and Tobago 1\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 177\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 176\r\nAbstentions: 8\r\nNumber of members voting: 168\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 112\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nAustralia 168\r\nFinland 167\r\nUnited Kingdom 167\r\nSweden 165\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nAustralia, Bhutan, Burundi, Chile, China, El\r\nSalvador, Finland, Ghana, Guatemala, Hungary,\r\nIndia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Qatar, the\r\nRussian Federation, Sweden, Ukraine, the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\r\nand Zimbabwe were elected members of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council for a three-year\r\nterm of office beginning on 1 January 2002.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and allocation of items\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/56/250/Add.1)\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof representatives to the second report of the General\r\nCommittee (A/56/250/Add.1), concerning a request by\r\na number of Member States for the inclusion of an\r\nadditional item in the agenda. In the report, the General\r\nCommittee decided to recommend to the General\r\nAssembly that an additional item, entitled “United\r\nNations Year of Cultural Heritage 2002”, be included\r\nin the agenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto include this additional item in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee further\r\ndecided to recommend to the General Assembly that\r\nthe additional item be considered directly in plenary\r\nmeeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto consider this item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 13\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\n(A/56/4)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/456)\r\nThe President: The report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice covering the period from 1 August\r\n2000 to 31 July 2001 is contained in document A/56/4.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes\r\nnote of the report of the International Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Gilbert\r\nGuillaume, President of the International Court of\r\nJustice.\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nMr. Guillaume (International Court of Justice)\r\n(spoke in French): It is an honour for me to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the second time on the occasion\r\nof its examination of the report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice — in this case, for the period 1 August\r\n2000 to 31 July 2001.\r\nThe fact that the Assembly has for more than a\r\ndecade invited the President of the Court to address it\r\nis evidence of the interest it takes in the Court as the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, and its\r\nrespect for the role played by the Court in the\r\nsettlement of disputes between States and in the\r\ndevelopment of international law. We are extremely\r\ngrateful to the Assembly for this.\r\nI am particularly pleased to address the Assembly\r\ntoday under the presidency of Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic\r\nof Korea, to whom I offer my warm congratulations on\r\nhis election. He has my sincerest wishes for every\r\nsuccess in his distinguished office.\r\nThe Court has, as usual, transmitted its annual\r\nreport to the Assembly; this report has been circulated,\r\nand the Assembly has taken note of it. The report\r\nshows that the Court’s docket is still extremely full and\r\nthat it continues to work at an unflagging pace. At this\r\ntime, the Court has 22 cases before it for consideration.\r\nThese cases come from every continent and touch\r\non an extremely wide range of issues. Three of them\r\nconcern territorial disputes between neighbouring\r\nStates: Cameroon and Nigeria, Indonesia and Malaysia,\r\nNicaragua and Honduras. These are complex disputes\r\nin which the Court has played and will continue to play\r\na prominent role, thereby contributing to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAnother classic type of dispute involves cases\r\nbetween States concerning the treatment of foreign\r\nnationals. There are two cases in this category: the first\r\nbetween Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, and the second between Liechtenstein and\r\nGermany.\r\nFinally, there are other cases linked more directly\r\nto events that the Assembly or the Security Council has\r\nhad to examine, such as the destruction of Iranian oil\r\nplatforms by the United States in 1987 and 1988; the\r\nconsequences of the explosion of an American civil\r\naircraft over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1992; the crises in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo; and the situation\r\nin the African Great Lakes region.\r\nIn the course of the past year the Court has made\r\nparticular efforts to address this increase in the number\r\nof disputes before it. In all, it has succeeded in\r\nconcluding four cases, while three new cases were\r\nbrought before it. On those occasions it delivered\r\nimportant decisions, about which I should now like to\r\nspeak for a few moments.\r\nIn a judgment rendered on 16 March 2001, the\r\nCourt began by adjudicating on the merits of a\r\nterritorial dispute between Qatar and Bahrain. That\r\njudgment brought to a conclusion lengthy proceedings\r\ninvolving the filing by the parties of more than 6,000\r\npages of written pleadings, five weeks of oral hearings\r\nand deliberations that were commensurate with the\r\ndifficulties that the Court encountered.\r\nThe Court found that the State of Bahrain has\r\nsovereignty over the Hawar Islands and the island of\r\nQit’at Jaradah. It recognized the sovereignty of the\r\nState of Qatar over Zubarah, Janan Island and the low-\r\ntide elevation of Fasht al Dibal. In the light of these\r\ndecisions, it fixed the boundaries of the different\r\nmaritime zones appertaining to Bahrain and Qatar and\r\nrestated the law applicable in this field. It also\r\nexplained the influence that islands, islets and low-tide\r\nelevations may have on maritime delimitations.\r\nThe judgment thus handed down brought an end\r\nto a long-standing dispute that had given rise to serious\r\ntension between the parties. Both of them thanked the\r\nCourt for this contribution to peace in the region and to\r\nthe restoration of friendly relations between two\r\nneighbouring States. The Court took particular pleasure\r\nin this and hopes that the wisdom that the two countries\r\ndisplayed in this instance will serve as an example to\r\nothers.\r\nIn the judicial year which has just come to a\r\nclose, a second judgment was handed down on 27 June\r\n2001, settling the merits of a dispute between Germany\r\nand the United States of America following the\r\nexecution in the United States of two German\r\nnationals. In its decision, the Court had occasion to\r\nclarify certain provisions of the Vienna Convention on\r\nConsular Relations of 24 April 1963. Further, for the\r\nfirst time in its history, the Court took the opportunity\r\nto give a clear ruling on the effect of the provisional\r\nmeasures which it has the power to indicate to parties\r\npursuant to article 41 of its Statute.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nThis issue — a delicate one — had been the\r\nsubject of lively controversy in the literature as to\r\nwhether or not a provisional measure is binding.\r\nBy a very large majority, the Court answered this\r\nquestion in the affirmative. It held that:\r\n“The object and purpose of the Statute is to\r\nenable the Court to fulfil the functions provided\r\nfor therein, and, in particular, the basic function\r\nof judicial settlement of international disputes by\r\nbinding decisions in accordance with article 59 of\r\nthe Statute. The context in which article 41 has to\r\nbe seen within the Statute is to prevent the Court\r\nfrom being hampered in the exercise of its\r\nfunctions because the respective rights of the\r\nparties to a dispute before the Court are not\r\npreserved. It follows from the object and purpose\r\nof the Statute, as well as from the terms of article\r\n41 when read in their context, that the power to\r\nindicate provisional measures entails that such\r\nmeasures should be binding.”\r\nThus there is no longer any room for doubt. The\r\nprovisional measures indicated as a matter of urgency\r\nby the Court for the purpose of safeguarding the rights\r\nof the parties are binding on them. The Court\r\nanticipates that in future these measures will, as a\r\nresult, be better executed than when the matter was\r\nsubject to doubt. We hope that the Court’s contribution\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nwill thereby be enhanced.\r\nHaving analysed the two most important rulings\r\nhanded down by the Court over the last year, I will not\r\ngo into detail on the other rulings handed down or on\r\nthe 32 orders, ranging widely in content, that have been\r\nissued.\r\nHowever, I should add that, since the drafting of\r\nthe report — concluded on 1 July 2001 — the Court\r\nhas dealt with three further cases. First, on 23 October,\r\nit delivered a ruling rejecting an application by the\r\nPhilippines for permission to intervene in a territorial\r\ndispute between Malaysia and Indonesia, while at the\r\nsame time taking formal note of the Philippine\r\nposition.\r\nSecondly, it commenced consideration of a\r\ncounterclaim submitted by Uganda against the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Thirdly, it held a\r\npublic hearing in a case between the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Belgium concerning the\r\nlegality of an international arrest warrant issued a year\r\nago by a Belgian investigating judge against the then\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Congo. Finally, at\r\nthe beginning of next year it will commence\r\nconsideration of the dispute between Cameroon and\r\nNigeria, devoting five weeks of public hearings to the\r\ncase.\r\nDespite these efforts, the Court’s docket remains\r\noverburdened. Several cases are ready to be heard\r\nduring 2002, and solutions will have to be found in\r\norder to avoid excessive delays in examining these\r\ncases.\r\nThe Court has attempted to meet this challenge\r\nby rationalizing work within the Registry and by\r\nmodernizing its working and communication methods.\r\nMajor progress has been made, notably with regard to\r\npublications and communications, Intranet and\r\nInternet. However, further progress is needed, for\r\nexample, in modernizing the Court’s archives, and the\r\nRegistry has taken this matter in hand.\r\nThe Court has also made efforts to improve its\r\nprocedures. As regards the preparation of cases, it has\r\nsought increased cooperation from the parties in the\r\nfunctioning of justice. In particular, it has again\r\ninformed them of its desire to see a decrease in the\r\nnumber of pleadings exchanged, in the volume of\r\nannexes to pleadings and in the length of oral\r\narguments. The Court’s comments have had the desired\r\neffect in the new cases brought before it. Thus, in the\r\ncase between the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nand Belgium, the parties agreed to exchange only one\r\nseries of written pleadings and to limit their oral\r\narguments to one week. However, old habits die hard,\r\nand it has been necessary in other cases to impose\r\ncertain restrictions on the parties in their own interest.\r\nSince 1997, the Court has taken several measures\r\nwith a view to speeding up its deliberations — a fact to\r\nwhich I drew the Assembly’s attention last year. It has\r\ncontinued these efforts. The days when our\r\npredecessors dealt with cases one at a time are long\r\ngone. In the week of 15 October, for example, the\r\nCourt deliberated on two cases while holding hearings\r\nin a third.\r\nFinally, the Court has recently taken various\r\ndecisions to improve its procedural rules. By amending\r\nrule 79 of its rules, it has reduced the time-limit within\r\nwhich preliminary objections may be raised. It has\r\nrevised rule 80 of its rules in respect of counter-claims\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nand amended rule 52, paragraph 3, concerning the\r\nprinting of pleadings. It proposes amending rule 56\r\nconcerning the production of new documents after the\r\nclosure of written proceedings. It has carried out a\r\ndetailed study of the practical issues involved in\r\nhearing a large number of witnesses. Finally, it has\r\ndecided to convert various indications formerly given\r\nto parties into true practice directions and has\r\nimplemented a procedure for reviewing those\r\ndirections at regular intervals.\r\nHowever, these various efforts, both\r\nadministrative and procedural, would not be sufficient\r\nin themselves to redress the situation. Accordingly, last\r\nyear, I appealed to the Assembly to ensure that the\r\nCourt might in future have the necessary financial and\r\nhuman resources to perform its duties properly.\r\nBeing well aware of the financial difficulties of\r\nthe United Nations, the Court has requested for the\r\ncoming biennium only a moderate increase in\r\nresources. The Advisory Committee on Administrative\r\nand Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) has considered our\r\nproposals sympathetically. While it has not agreed to\r\nall our requests, it has nonetheless recommended to the\r\nGeneral Assembly a significant increase in our budget\r\nfrom $20,606,700 for the biennium 2000-2001 to\r\n$22,873,500 for the coming biennium: an increase of\r\n11 per cent. The Court is grateful to the Advisory\r\nCommittee and hopes that these proposals will meet\r\nwith your agreement.\r\nIf that is the case, the staff in the Registry of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice would be increased to 91\r\npersons. This figure is still modest, but the increase\r\nwill certainly enable the Court to work under better\r\nconditions and achieve improved results in the coming\r\nyear. In the light of experience, the Court will\r\ndetermine whether these resources, particularly in\r\nrespect of the translation service and law clerks, are\r\nsufficient. In any event, the Assembly can rest assured\r\nthat, with the new resources at its disposal, the Court\r\nwill do its utmost to adjudicate the current cases as\r\nexpeditiously as possible, while maintaining the quality\r\nof its jurisprudence.\r\nThe Member States of the United Nations have\r\nundertaken, pursuant to Article 33 of the Charter, to\r\nseek by peaceful means the solution to any dispute the\r\ncontinuance of which is likely to endanger the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Article\r\n36, paragraph 3, provides that legal disputes should be\r\nreferred by the parties to the International Court of\r\nJustice in accordance with the provisions of the Statute\r\nof the Court. The Court thus has a prominent role to\r\nplay in the solution of legal disputes and hence in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nHowever, the progress noted in this respect in\r\nrecent years should not lead us to harbour the illusion\r\nthat peace between nations can be assured by methods\r\nappropriate for the settlement of legal disputes, or even\r\nthat it is for the Court to prevent and put an end to\r\narmed conflicts. The Court cannot be the sole guarantor\r\nof peace. That is a task which depends on action taken\r\nby the General Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nFurthermore, in addition to these various mechanisms,\r\nwe should always remain conscious of the fact that war\r\nis, first and foremost, the creation of the human spirit\r\nand that security can be achieved only through human\r\nendeavour.\r\nNevertheless, the International Court of Justice\r\ncan play an important role in preventing conflicts,\r\nparticularly territorial conflicts, as the experience\r\ngained by the Court in all continents demonstrates. In\r\nthis light, I would particularly wish to encourage States\r\nwhich have such disputes to refer those disputes to the\r\nCourt by way of special agreement. The Court is aware\r\nthat certain States in Africa, in Europe and in Asia are\r\nconsidering such action at the present time, and it\r\nwelcomes that fact.\r\nIn this connection, I would moreover call your\r\nattention to the special fund established by the\r\nSecretary-General in 1989 to assist States unable to\r\nmeet the expenses incurred in submitting a dispute to\r\nthe Court. While addressing the Assembly from this\r\nvery rostrum, my predecessors were concerned to\r\nemphasize the importance of such a fund for countries\r\nwith limited financial resources. They also encouraged\r\nthose States which are able to make more generous\r\ncontributions to this fund to do so by increasing the\r\nresources at its disposal. With the permission of the\r\nAssembly, I should like to add my voice to theirs and\r\nto reiterate this appeal to all Member States and call\r\nupon them to support this fund financially with a view\r\nto enabling the poorest States to have easier access to\r\nthe Court. Access to international justice should not be\r\nimpeded by financial inequality.\r\nThe nineteenth century was the century that saw\r\nthe development of international law and arbitration.\r\nInternational judicial settlement was born in the\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\ntwentieth century with the Permanent Court of\r\nInternational Justice, which in 1945 became the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. Since then, international\r\ntribunals have proliferated.\r\nThis phenomenon reflects greater confidence in\r\njustice and makes it possible for international law to\r\ndevelop in ever more varied spheres. However, it also\r\nraises the risk of parties competing for courts —\r\nsometimes referred to as “forum shopping” — and\r\nconflicting jurisprudence. Each year, for the last six\r\nyears, successive presidents of the Court have called\r\nthe Assembly’s attention to these risks which on\r\nseveral occasions have since been realized.\r\nI am bound to do so again. The proliferation of\r\ninternational courts may jeopardize the unity of\r\ninternational law and, as a consequence, its role in\r\ninter-State relations.\r\nNo new international court should be created\r\nwithout first questioning whether the duties which the\r\ninternational legislator intends to confer on it could not\r\nbe better performed by an existing court. International\r\ncourts should be aware of the dangers involved in the\r\nfragmentation of the law and take efforts to avoid such\r\ndangers. However, those efforts may not be enough,\r\nand the International Court of Justice, the only judicial\r\nbody vested with universal and general jurisdiction, has\r\na role to play in this area. For the purpose of\r\nmaintaining the unity of the law, the various existing\r\ncourts or those yet to be created could, in my opinion,\r\nbe empowered in certain cases — indeed\r\nencouraged — to request advisory opinions from the\r\nInternational Court of Justice through the intermediary\r\nof the Security Council or through the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nInternational society needs peace. International\r\nsociety needs judges to watch over the law. To that end,\r\nthe Assembly can rest assured that the International\r\nCourt of Justice will continue to perform the duties it\r\ncurrently bears, and that it is ready to fulfil other duties\r\nthat may be entrusted to it. The Court expresses its\r\ngratitude for any assistance the Assembly may be able\r\nto give it.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for his statement.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): As the\r\nfirst speaker, and having personally known Mr. Kittani,\r\nallow me to say that I was witness to his great\r\ndiplomatic and human abilities, as well as his services\r\nto the international community. I would therefore like\r\nto extend the deepest sympathy of the delegation of\r\nPeru to his family and to the delegation of Iraq.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Judge Gilbert\r\nGuillaume, President of the International Court of\r\nJustice, for his clear statement on the work of the Court\r\nfor the period from August 2000 through July 2001.\r\nAlthough my country has a long tradition of\r\nrespect for the law, in recent times Peruvians were able\r\nto experience up close how an elected Government\r\ntried to destroy democratic institutions and the rule of\r\nlaw and to subjugate the political rights of its citizens.\r\nFortunately, that sombre episode has been overcome\r\nwith the re-establishment of genuine democracy and\r\nthe rule of law in Peru. However, the unpleasant\r\nexperience of seeing an elected Government destroy\r\ndemocratic institutions has served to strengthen our\r\nbelief in the need to observe the rule of law and justice\r\nas necessary conditions for social harmony and\r\neconomic development.\r\nThis conviction is also applicable to the\r\ninternational scene. The viability of the international\r\ncommunity depends on a genuine commitment by\r\nStates to respect international law and to seek solutions\r\nto their disputes through juridical means. In this\r\nconnection, the International Court of Justice has a\r\ngreat task to accomplish in the twenty-first century, not\r\nonly with regard to resolving various differences but\r\nalso in producing the precedents that are a valuable\r\nelement in the process of the progressive codifying of\r\ninternational law and in the preventive character\r\nimplicit in the law. The same also applies to the various\r\nadvisory opinions that have been issued by the Court.\r\nIt is in that context that the annual report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice takes on special\r\nimportance, especially as we have witnessed in shock\r\nthe disastrous consequences of the lack of peaceful\r\nsolutions to the disputes on the current international\r\nscene. We are therefore pleased that during the period\r\nunder consideration 26 cases were submitted to the\r\njurisdiction of the Court.\r\nWe welcome the settlement of the long-standing\r\nterritorial and maritime dispute between Qatar and\r\nBahrain regarding sovereignty over the Hawar Islands,\r\nsovereignty rights over the Dibal and Qit’at Jaradah\r\nshoals, and the delimitation of the maritime areas of the\r\ntwo States. In addition to resolving the dispute, the\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\ndecision has established important legal precedents\r\nwith regard to innocent passage, emerging insular\r\nsurfaces and maritime delimitation.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nThe Court also issued a decision regarding a\r\nsubstantive issue between Germany and the United\r\nStates on the execution of the LaGrand brothers. That\r\ndecision also produced valuable legal precedents on the\r\njuridical effects of the provisional measures provided\r\nfor in article 41 of the Court’s Statute. We hope that the\r\n22 contentious cases still pending will also find a\r\ndefinitive solution soon.\r\nWe very much appreciate the efforts of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice to rationalize its work, as\r\nwell as its growing use of information technology to\r\nthat end. The web site established by the Court several\r\nyears ago continues to compile information of value to\r\nlaw students, persons working in the legal field,\r\ndiplomats, legislators and the general public. We also\r\nwelcome the review of the Court’s rules to make them\r\nmore efficient and flexible. It is important not only to\r\nprovide justice; it must be done in a timely manner.\r\nHowever, despite the important administrative\r\nefforts made by the Court, there is a significant\r\nlogistical problem, namely, the lack of necessary\r\nbudgetary resources for a growing procedural load.\r\nThis situation must be duly remedied to be in line with\r\nthe privileged position conferred upon the Court by\r\nArticle 92 of the Charter as the “principal judicial\r\norgan of the United Nations”, and to ensure the Court’s\r\nproper role in the new century.\r\nThe review of the Court’s regulations, which is\r\naimed at making legal proceedings more streamlined\r\nand expeditious, may also provide a good opportunity\r\nto incorporate changes designed to make judicial\r\nproceedings less onerous for both the Court and the\r\nparties before it, without affecting the right of parties\r\nto due process.\r\nThe actual reach of the Court is limited by its\r\nStatute, in that States can chose whether or not to place\r\nthemselves under its jurisdiction. All necessary efforts\r\nmust be made to ensure that its contentious jurisdiction\r\nis extended — ratione persone. To date only 63 States\r\nhave made declarations acknowledging the mandatory\r\njurisdiction of the Court, in accordance with article 36,\r\nparagraphs 2 and 5, of the Statute. The International\r\nCourt of Justice will be universal only if the Member\r\nStates maintain the genuine will that it be universal in\r\nscope. The effectiveness of international law will\r\ndepend to a considerable extent on the degree of\r\neffective commitment to the obligatory binding nature\r\nof the Court’s findings.\r\nPeru, which has resolved its disputes peacefully\r\nand has resorted to the Court’s jurisdiction twice,\r\nreiterates its appreciation for the International Court of\r\nJustice’s fundamental task of preserving peace, and it\r\nratifies its commitment to respect law and justice in its\r\ninternational relations for the sake of harmonious\r\nrelations in the world.\r\nMr. Niehaus (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me at the outset to thank the International Court\r\nof Justice for the valuable report we are now\r\nconsidering and its President, Judge Gilbert Guillaume,\r\nfor his statement. We note with satisfaction the\r\nsubstantial improvements in this document, which\r\nallows us to appreciate in depth the invaluable work of\r\nthis judicial organ to the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes. I would also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Judge Nabil Elaraby of Egypt on his\r\nrecent well-deserved election to this high tribunal.\r\nThe International Court of Justice has become an\r\nengine of peaceful relations among nations. We have\r\nseen how in some cases legal disputes can deteriorate\r\ninto real threats to peace or international security\r\nbecause of their unnecessary and irresponsible\r\npoliticization. Land disputes in particular can easily\r\nlead to military escalation. The peaceful resolution of\r\ndisputes in those cases through the International Court\r\nof Justice reduces tension and resolves definitively\r\ndisputes among States. Therefore, my delegation very\r\nmuch appreciates the contribution of the International\r\nCourt of Justice to world stability.\r\nFurthermore, as the main judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, the International Court of Justice plays\r\na central role in the progressive development of\r\ncontemporary international law. Not only does it settle\r\ndisputes among States peacefully, it also has a\r\ndeclaratory role in defining international law applicable\r\nto all nations. Its jurisprudence in contentious cases\r\nand advisory opinions not only determines the rights\r\nand the obligations of the parties to a conflict, but also\r\nclarifies obscure or controversial areas of law for other\r\nStates. We recall and admire the many times the Court\r\nhas taken progressive stances that have promoted and\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nconsolidated the development of the international legal\r\norder.\r\nIn this context, I wish to mention the extremely\r\nimportant findings of the Court in the LaGrand case,\r\nhanded down on 27 June 2001. We consider its\r\ninterpretation of the Vienna Convention on Consular\r\nRelations very appropriate because it recognizes that\r\nthat international instrument establishes individual\r\nrights which all Member States must respect. We also\r\nnote with satisfaction its decision that provisional\r\nmeasures dictated by the Court impose an obligation of\r\ncompliance.\r\nCosta Rica believes that the substantial increase\r\nin the number of cases on the Court docket is a positive\r\nindication of States’ will to submit to legal principles\r\nin the conduct of their international relations.\r\nAccepting the mandatory jurisdiction of the Court\r\nthrough optional declarations clearly demonstrates\r\ngood will. In this regard, we congratulate the\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Lesotho on its\r\ndeclaration of this kind made during the period under\r\nreview.\r\nSimilarly, we must note our concern about the\r\nexistence and the presentation of new reservations on\r\nvoluntary acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction. We\r\ncall on all States that have not yet done so to\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to the basic principles\r\nof international law and the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes by accepting the Court’s mandatory\r\njurisdiction and withdrawing the reservations they may\r\nhave interjected.\r\nMy delegation is also aware of the practical\r\ndifficulties that the Court has experienced in recent\r\nyears as a result of the unexpected increase in the\r\nnumber of cases. Undoubtedly, we must provide the\r\nCourt with the necessary resources and staff to enable\r\nit to discharge obligations arising from this increase in\r\nthe number of cases. In this context, we cannot forget\r\nthat its budget pales in comparison to the budget of the\r\nad hoc tribunals established by the Security Council.\r\nThat is why we welcome the decision of the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions to authorize an increase in the number of\r\nstaff and the budget of the Court. My delegation is\r\nprepared to support this decision and to view positively\r\nall additional requests the Court may make in the\r\nfuture.\r\nMy country appreciates the excellent\r\ndissemination that the Court achieves through its\r\nInternet web site. It is an invaluable service for\r\ndeveloping countries that sometimes experience\r\ndifficulties accessing the most recent jurisprudence. We\r\ntrust that in the future the Court will expand its Internet\r\nweb site by including the full text of all its findings and\r\nsentences handed down since its inception. Eventually\r\nthe Court may wish to include jurisprudence from the\r\nformer Permanent Court of International Justice.\r\nThe international community is going through a\r\ndifficult period. It has never been more necessary to\r\nreaffirm the rule of law and the pre-eminence of\r\ninternational law. Today we must restate our resolute\r\nand unconditional commitment to the peaceful\r\nresolution of disputes.\r\nToday we must reject unilateral action in order to\r\nresolve disputes, while embracing negotiation,\r\ndialogue, mediation and the legal resolution of\r\ndisputes. This is the only way that we will be able to\r\nbuild a more just and peaceful world for the well-being\r\nof all peoples. That is why Costa Rica supports and has\r\nfull confidence in the excellent work of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation wishes to thank Judge Gilbert Guillaume,\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for his\r\npresentation of the report of the Court contained in\r\ndocument A/56/4. The comprehensive report contains a\r\nwealth of information about the work of the Court.\r\nThis is extremely useful to Member States in\r\nappreciating the complexity of the issues handled by\r\nthe Court. Judge Guillaume’s oral presentation this\r\nmorning was most illuminating and has given us food\r\nfor thought. My delegation would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to extend our felicitations to Judge Nabil\r\nElaraby on his recent election.\r\nMy delegation would like to pay a tribute to the\r\nCourt for its contribution to the peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational disputes, in furtherance of the first\r\npurpose of the United Nations enshrined in Article 1 of\r\nthe Charter, namely:\r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in\r\nconformity with the principles of justice and\r\ninternational law, adjustment or settlement of\r\ninternational disputes … which might lead to a\r\nbreach of the peace”.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nUndeniably, as the principal judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, the International Court of Justice has a\r\ntremendous influence on the promotion of peace and\r\nharmony between nations and peoples of the world\r\nthrough the rule of law. The importance of its role in\r\nsettling, in accordance with international law, legal\r\ndisputes submitted by States and giving advisory\r\nopinions on legal questions referred to it by duly\r\nauthorized international organs and agencies is not to\r\nbe taken lightly.\r\nSince 1946 the Court has delivered 72 judgments\r\non disputes concerning, inter alia, land frontiers and\r\nmaritime boundaries, territorial sovereignty, the non-\r\nuse of force, non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates, diplomatic relations, the right of asylum,\r\nnationality, guardianship, rights of passage and\r\neconomic rights. In the same period it has also given\r\n24 advisory opinions concerning, inter alia, admission\r\nto United Nations membership, reparation for injuries\r\nsuffered in the service of the United Nations, the\r\nterritorial status of South-West Africa — now\r\nNamibia — and Western Sahara, judgements rendered\r\nby international administrative tribunals, expenses of\r\ncertain United Nations operations, applicability of the\r\nUnited Nations Headquarters Agreement, the status of\r\nhuman rights rapporteurs and the legality of the threat\r\nor use of nuclear weapons. Indeed, the wisdom and\r\nfairness of this body is evident from the excellent\r\nquality of the judgments and opinions that it has\r\nhanded down and their acceptance by the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\nIt is this confidence in the International Court of\r\nJustice that strengthens Malaysia’s belief that the Court\r\nis the most appropriate forum for the peaceful and final\r\nresolution of disputes when all efforts of diplomacy\r\nhave been exhausted in vain. To this end, Malaysia, in\r\nmutual agreement with Indonesia, decided to submit\r\nthe territorial dispute between them for adjudication by\r\nthe Court. This dispute, which relates to the\r\nsovereignty over two islands — namely, Pulau Ligitan\r\nand Pulau Sipadan — is currently before the Court. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the decision of the Court,\r\ndelivered on 23 October 2001, regarding the request by\r\nour neighbour the Philippines to intervene in the case.\r\nWe trust that the Court’s decision will be fully\r\nrespected, thereby enhancing the Court’s stature and\r\nprestige among Member States, This is important in\r\ninculcating a culture of respect for international law in\r\nrelations among States.\r\nMy delegation notes with interest that there has\r\nbeen increasing recourse to the Court by Member\r\nStates over the years. This clearly demonstrates the\r\ngrowing confidence in the decisions of the Court and\r\nreliance on the settlement of disputes through\r\nadjudication rather than by use of force. The significant\r\nincrease of cases in the Court’s docket — from 9 to 13\r\ncases between 1990 and 1997 to the current 22 cases —\r\naugurs well for the progressive development of\r\ninternational law and the role of the Court as a dispute\r\nsettlement mechanism. It is also heartening to note that\r\n63 States have declared the acceptance of the Court’s\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction in accordance with article 36,\r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute. Also noteworthy is the\r\nincreasing trend of referring treaties, whether bilateral\r\nor multilateral, to the Court for jurisdiction in the\r\nresolution of disputes arising out of their application or\r\ninterpretation.\r\nIn light of the increase in the Court’s workload,\r\nmy delegation strongly believes that there is an urgent\r\nneed to strengthen the Court’s capacity to efficiently\r\ndispose of the cases before it, as well as to undertake\r\nthe additional administrative responsibilities arising\r\ntherefrom. In this respect, we hope the financial\r\nresources allocated to the Court will correspond to its\r\nneeds in dealing with the increased workload. On its\r\npart, the Court has continued to implement the various\r\nmeasures that it had initiated to overcome the severe\r\nstrain caused by reductions in human and financial\r\nresources since 1997. It has gone to great lengths to\r\nrationalize the work of the Registry, to make greater\r\nuse of information technology, to improve its own\r\nworking methods and to secure greater collaboration\r\nfrom parties in relation to its procedures. We are\r\npleased to note that the Court has taken steps to shorten\r\nand simplify proceedings and is continuing its revision\r\nof the Rules of the Court.\r\nWe are also pleased to note that the General\r\nAssembly had approved a supplementary budget for the\r\nyear 2001 which made possible the enhancement of the\r\nCourt’s Department of Linguistic Matters with the\r\ncreation of the much-needed posts of translators and\r\nsecretarial staff. However, this is not sufficient to\r\novercome the budgetary problems faced by the Court.\r\nFor the biennium 2002-2003, the Court has found itself\r\nobliged to request substantial appropriations which are\r\nrequired to enhance the capacity of other departments\r\nof the Court and to provide assistance for the judges.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that this request has\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nbeen considered favourably by the Advisory\r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions\r\n(ACABQ) and hopes that it will be approved by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It is essential that the Court\r\ncontinue to be afforded the resources to enable it to\r\nwork as intensively and expeditiously as its increasing\r\nworkload demands.\r\nMy delegation commends the Court’s efforts to\r\nincrease public awareness and understanding of its\r\nwork in the judicial settlement of disputes and its\r\nadvisory functions through its publications and lectures\r\nby members of the Court. In this regard, we commend\r\nthe steps taken by the Court to update and modernize\r\nthe methods of disseminating information concerning\r\nits work by utilizing the electronic media and the\r\nconstruction of a web site. Indeed, the Court’s web site\r\nis well utilized by students, academicians, diplomats\r\nand interested members of the public. It is an extremely\r\nuseful source of public access to the Court’s judgments\r\nand the most recent developments in international case\r\nlaw.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation believes that, like\r\nother organs within the United Nations system, the\r\nInternational Court of Justice should also benefit from\r\nthe ongoing reform undertaken by the United Nations.\r\nA revitalized International Court of Justice would\r\ncertainly contribute to its efficiency and enhance its\r\nrole in the promotion of justice under international law.\r\nMr. Chik (Singapore): My delegation would like\r\nto congratulate the International Court of Justice for its\r\ncontinued good work in enforcing the rule of law in the\r\npast year. From the size and diversity of cases\r\nsubmitted to the Court, the increase in volume and\r\ncomplexity and the sustained activity in dealing with\r\nits cases, my delegation is truly impressed by the\r\nCourt’s ability to deal with its increased workload\r\nunder very tight budgetary constraints. The\r\ninternational community spends only about $11 million\r\na year on the International Court of Justice, while it\r\nspends about $206 million on the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\r\nWith 190 parties to the Statute of the Court, 63\r\nStates recognizing the Court’s jurisdiction as\r\ncompulsory and an ever expanding list of multilateral\r\nand bilateral conventions providing for the Court’s\r\njurisdiction, the Court’s role is as vital as ever.\r\nThe past year has seen cases before the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on a myriad of\r\ninternational law topics, including the use of force,\r\nmaritime and land boundary, diplomatic protection,\r\nstate responsibility and the law of treaties. The\r\ndecisions of the Court also have an even wider-ranging\r\neffect with implications for other areas of law.\r\nFor example, in the Gabčikovo case, the Court\r\nhas gone a considerable distance towards achieving\r\nmilestones in the areas of environmental and\r\nwatercourses law, even though the judgment was not\r\nprimarily based on those areas of law. It was the first\r\nreal case dealing with substantive water law issues,\r\nestablishing reasonable and equitable use as the\r\ngoverning principle, and also gave increased\r\njurisprudence into the principles and standards of\r\ninternational environmental law. It was also the\r\nGabčikovo case which affirmed the law of\r\ncountermeasures and influenced the retention of article\r\n22 in the final text on state responsibility for\r\ninternationally wrongful acts developed by the\r\nInternational Law Commission.\r\nSimilarly, in the LaGrand case, questions of\r\nassurances and guarantees of non-repetition were\r\nraised as central issues, leading the International Law\r\nCommission to decide on a review of the principle of\r\ncessation and other related articles. These are some\r\nillustrations of the ongoing cooperation and exchange\r\nof views between the Court and other lawmaking and\r\ncodification forums, which is so integral a part of the\r\nprocess of developing a coherent body of law.\r\nReferring back to the Gabčikovo case, for example, we\r\nalso note the Court’s flexibility in setting and defining\r\nthe fundamental legal parameters for negotiations\r\nbetween parties, which could help forge results that\r\nwould be mutually acceptable, rather than provide one-\r\nsided solutions.\r\nSimilarly, in the case between Qatar and Bahrain,\r\nthe decision was uncommonly satisfactory to both\r\nparties. We hope to see more decisions of this kind in\r\nthe future, which will contribute to good relations\r\nbetween States.\r\nSingapore continues to fully support the work of\r\nthe International Court of Justice and follows with\r\ninterest every decision and advisory opinion produced\r\nby the Court. In these uncertain times, especially\r\nhaving witnessed the atrocious and lawless events\r\nwhich transpired in September, upholding and\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nenforcing the law in all its symbolism and reality is\r\nmore vital than ever. The Court plays a key role in\r\nfurthering international peace and security by\r\nimpartially and fairly adjudicating matters involving,\r\nfor example, the application of the genocide\r\nConvention in complaints of violations and the United\r\nNations Charter on issues regarding the legitimate use\r\nof force, in some of the Court’s cases.\r\nFrom the substantive treatment of the law to\r\nprocedural methodology, my delegation is pleased to\r\nnote how the Court has striven to keep up with the\r\ntimes. The Registry, under the capable leadership of\r\nMr. Philippe Couvreur and Mr. Jean-Jacques Arnaldez,\r\nhas instituted improvements in the use of information\r\ntechnology. We appreciate the Court’s constant efforts\r\nto improve its working methods and to remain\r\nefficient. This adaptability of the Court and its Registry\r\nis highly commendable.\r\nWe note in particular the Court’s steps to shorten\r\nand simplify pleadings and proceedings, notably article\r\n79 relating to preliminary objections and article 80\r\nrelating to counter-claims. These measures will\r\ncertainly shorten the time of proceedings, clarify the\r\nrules and adapt them to reality.\r\nWe note, however, that the Computerization\r\nDivision is particularly small. Despite its efficiency,\r\ngiven the current allocation of resources, my delegation\r\nis concerned that the Court may not be in a position to\r\ntake advantage of some of the advancements in global\r\ntechnology for streamlining and simplifying its\r\nprocedures, such as the use of electronic filing and the\r\ndigital submission of pleadings and submissions. We\r\nrecognize that training and the implementation of such\r\nimprovements are intrinsically linked to the question of\r\nfunding and resources, which the Court has time and\r\nagain appealed for.\r\nIndeed, it is disturbing that the Court has to\r\nconstantly appeal for funding for work so important\r\nand vital to the enunciation and development of\r\ninternational jurisprudence. If States are seriously\r\ncommitted to the development and maintenance of\r\ninternational law, there must be a meeting of\r\ncommitments by the paying up of arrears and the\r\nfurther dedication of greater funding.\r\nSingapore places great emphasis on the rule of\r\nlaw, both domestic and international. Our Government\r\nwill continue to regard with interest the decisions of\r\nthe International Court of Justice and to support the\r\nCourt’s work in whatever way we can.\r\nMr. Robledo (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): It is\r\nan honour for my delegation, as it has been every year\r\nin the past, to address this Assembly on the item\r\n“Report of the International Court of Justice”. I am\r\ngrateful to Judge Gilbert Guillaume, President of the\r\nCourt, for presenting the report and for his comments.\r\nHis words are always illuminating and they always\r\nstimulate our thinking.\r\nThe presentation of the report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice is always an invaluable opportunity to\r\nstrengthen dialogue and the ties between the General\r\nAssembly and our highest judicial organ. It also\r\ninforms us in greater detail of the Court’s activities\r\nover the past year.\r\nReading the document before the Assembly was\r\nvery encouraging to my delegation. The quantity of\r\ninformation it contains has improved our knowledge of\r\nthe way in which the Court works, the challenges it\r\nfaces and possible ways of helping it to overcome its\r\ndifficulties. We are grateful to the Court for having\r\nintroduced some improvements to its reports and hope\r\nthat it will continue to do so. The more we understand\r\nthe difficulties it encounters, the easier it will be to find\r\nsolutions to them.\r\nThe number of cases brought before the Court\r\ncontinues to grow. It is currently seized with an\r\nextensive list of cases originating in all regions of the\r\nworld and covering the most diverse topics. This\r\ndemonstrates the great confidence that the members of\r\nthe international community place in the machinery for\r\nthe judicial resolution of disputes and will henceforth\r\ncontribute to strengthening international law.\r\nSpeaking of the Court’s workload, we cannot fail\r\nto recognize the very responsible and timely action of\r\nthe Court to confront its growing number of cases. In\r\nthis respect, the consideration of the item on\r\nstrengthening the International Court of Justice,\r\npromoted by Mexico in the Sixth Committee,\r\nundoubtedly contributed to increasing the resources\r\nallocated to the Court. Nevertheless, offering greater\r\nfinancial resources is not the only way to facilitate the\r\nprocessing of cases before the Court. We must also\r\nadopt measures to strengthen and streamline the\r\nhandling of procedures.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nAware of this need, the Court has adopted a series\r\nof measures to review and continuously upgrade its\r\nworking methods. We encourage it to pursue that path.\r\nWe note once again that, whenever all the parties\r\ninvolved in a case cooperate to streamline proceedings,\r\nthe time required to resolve it is reduced.\r\nWe note that, in the period covered by the report,\r\ntwo contentious cases were resolved. These were the\r\ndelimitation dispute between Qatar and Bahrain and the\r\nLaGrand case between Germany and the United States.\r\nIn both cases, the Court has made significant\r\ncontributions to international law and towards the\r\nobjective of facilitating the future implementation of\r\ninternational legal norms. We are grateful to the Court\r\nfor those two decisions.\r\nBecause of the importance that Mexico attaches\r\nto the matters considered by the Court in the LaGrand\r\ncase, we would like to avail ourselves of this\r\nopportunity to highlight some of the conclusions of the\r\nCourt.\r\nThe Court resolved a long-standing debate by\r\ndetermining that the provisional measures set forth in\r\nits decisions, in conformity with article 41 of its\r\nStatute, are binding and create a legal obligation for the\r\nStates to which they are addressed. We believe that this\r\nrelevant conclusion is also valid for measures decreed\r\nby other tribunals similar to the Court, especially for\r\nregional courts that have jurisdiction in matters of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nSecondly, as regards the obligations contained in\r\narticle 36, paragraph 1, of the Vienna Convention on\r\nConsular Relations, the Court determined that that\r\narticle confers individual rights as well as rights of\r\nStates. Mexico supports this conclusion. At the same\r\ntime, we would have preferred the Court to pronounce\r\nitself on all the questions presented for its\r\nconsideration on this topic and to determine\r\nunambiguously that the rights contained in article 36,\r\nparagraph 1, of that Vienna Convention are of the same\r\nnature as human rights. This question has been\r\nexamined in other forums, including by the Inter-\r\nAmerican Court of Human Rights in its advisory\r\nopinion OC-16. There are strong elements in\r\ninternational law that allow us to reaffirm this\r\nconclusion. A pronouncement by the Court on this\r\ntopic would have been very relevant. However, the fact\r\nthat the Court did not go into this discussion does not\r\nin any way change the human rights character that\r\nother organs have attributed to article 36, paragraph 1,\r\nof the Vienna Convention.\r\nFinally, as regards compensation for violations of\r\nthe rights conferred upon individuals under article 36\r\nof the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the\r\nCourt found that an apology is inadequate in cases in\r\nwhich persons have been detained for extended periods\r\nor found guilty and sentenced to severe punishments.\r\nIn these situations, the State that commits the violation\r\nshould allow the review and reconsideration of the\r\nsentence and punishment, taking into account the\r\nviolation of the rights conferred by the Vienna\r\nConvention. As in all the cases resolved by the Court,\r\nwe are convinced that its decision in the LaGrand case\r\nwill contribute to the effective implementation of\r\ninstruments such as the Vienna Convention on\r\nConsular Relations, and will help States resolve\r\npotential future disputes.\r\nThere is no question about the importance of the\r\ndecisions of the Court and its influence on the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of the standards of\r\ninternational law. We are convinced that to facilitate\r\nthe work of our supreme judicial organ, States must\r\naccompany their expressions of support with the\r\nadoption of concrete measures that will strengthen\r\ncompliance. In the Fifth Committee Mexico will\r\nsupport the granting of greater resources to the Court\r\nand will continue to see to it that it has the necessary\r\ntools to fulfil its lofty mandate in the same effective\r\nand professional manner as it has done thus far.\r\nMr. Kamara (Sierra Leone): On behalf of the\r\nSierra Leone delegation, I would like to express my\r\nappreciation to the President of the International Court\r\nof Justice, Mr. Gilbert Guillaume, for his introduction\r\nof the comprehensive and very interesting report on the\r\nwork of the Court. His presence here to apprise the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the activities of the Court is an\r\naffirmation of the symbiotic relationship which exists\r\nbetween the two organs of this world body in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes. Today, the International Court is\r\nrecognized as a symbol of international justice and the\r\nrule of law throughout the world. That this is so is in\r\nno small measure attributable to the President of the\r\nCourt for the wise leadership which he has continued to\r\nprovide it.\r\nSierra Leone attaches great importance to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and all that it stands for.\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nBy virtue of its being the principal judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, of its permanent nature and of the wide\r\nrange of legal disputes which are submitted to it for\r\njudicial settlement, the Court is today making a major\r\ncontribution to a more peaceful world.\r\nAccording to the report for the year under\r\nconsideration, the Court’s docket has continued to\r\nexpand as more and more disputes are referred to it\r\nfrom the various regions of the world. This is a\r\nwelcome development. It attests to the confidence\r\nwhich the Court now enjoys on the part of the\r\ninternational community that it can render impartial\r\nand just decisions in the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes. In this regard, my delegation has taken\r\nparticular cognizance of the role of the Court in\r\nadjudicating disputes between African States and, in so\r\ndoing, helping to decrease tension in the region, as well\r\nas contributing to the advancement of States and to\r\nregional peace and stability.\r\nWe have also noted the efforts of the Court to\r\nmodernize and improve its methods of work, both with\r\nrespect to its procedures and with a view to reaching\r\nthe public through its publications and the Internet. In\r\nthis connection, we find the report itself very useful\r\nand comprehensive. My delegation welcomes these\r\ndevelopments and believes they can contribute to the\r\nproper and effective administration of justice and the\r\nwider appreciation of the role of the Court.\r\nWithout a doubt, if the Court is to continue to\r\noperate as a modern institution and render justice\r\nspeedily and efficiently, it should be provided with the\r\nnecessary resources to make adjudication as\r\nexpeditious as possible, while maintaining the quality\r\nof jurisprudence. The Court has demonstrated that it is\r\ncost-effective. My delegation will support the request\r\nfor modestly increased resources to be made available\r\nto it.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to join the\r\nappeal for an increase in monetary contributions to\r\nreplenish or augment the Secretary-General’s Trust\r\nFund to assist States, in particular, developing States,\r\nto settle their disputes through the Court. The fund has\r\nalready justified its existence by encouraging States to\r\nbring their disputes before the Court instead of\r\nresorting to armed conflict. This not only represents a\r\npeaceful way to resolve a conflict, but is also far more\r\neconomical. The appeal is therefore worthy of our\r\nsupport.\r\nMr. Onobu (Nigeria): My delegation commends\r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice,\r\nJudge Gilbert Guillaume, for his lucid introduction of\r\nthe report of the Court for the period 1 August 2000 to\r\n31 July 2001 (A/56/4). The report contains a\r\ncomprehensive account of the Court’s activities during\r\nthe period under review.\r\nAs we all know, the International Court of Justice\r\nis the only court with a universal character and general\r\njurisdiction. It plays a pivotal role in the pacific\r\nsettlement of disputes between Member States and in\r\nthe development of international law. States, in\r\nexercise of their sovereignty, voluntarily submit\r\ndisputes to the Court for arbitration. It is therefore\r\nsignificant that, as at 31 July 2001, 63 States had\r\ndeposited with the Secretary-General declarations of\r\nacceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction\r\nunder article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute. It is the\r\nview of my delegation that action along those lines by\r\nStates which have yet to take such action would further\r\nstrengthen the arbitration function of the Court in\r\ndisputes between Member States.\r\nThere has been an enormous increase in the\r\nworkload of the Court. Without doubt, that is a\r\nreflection of the increasing recognition of the Court’s\r\njurisdiction. It is worthy of note that, whereas in the\r\n1970s the Court had only one or two cases on its\r\ndocket at any one time, the number of cases increased\r\ndramatically between 1990 and 1997, and that as at 31\r\nJuly 2001 it stood at 22. The subject matter of these\r\ncases includes a wide variety of issues, ranging from\r\ndisputes over land and maritime boundaries and\r\nsovereignty over particular areas to questions on the\r\nlegality of the use of force and the expropriation of\r\nforeign property. We note with appreciation that the\r\nCourt was able during the judicial year under review to\r\ndispose of some of the cases before it and to issue 32\r\norders concerning the organization of proceedings in\r\ncurrent cases.\r\nIt is clear from the report that the Court has been\r\nable to make significant progress in its assignment as a\r\nresult of various measures it embarked upon aimed at\r\nimproving its working methods. My delegation is\r\nhappy to note that those measures, which started in\r\n1997, have continued. Nigeria believes that with more\r\naccess to information technology the Court is poised to\r\nachieve even greater success in the future.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nIt must be noted, however, that the increased\r\nworkload will of necessity require an increased\r\nfinancial allocation to the Court. It is our view that, for\r\nthe Court to cope with its increased workload and to\r\nsustain the high standard for which it has a worldwide\r\nreputation, more resources must be allocated to it. In\r\nthat regard, I note with satisfaction that the General\r\nAssembly approved in December 2000 a\r\nsupplementary budget for the Court to enable it to meet\r\nthe cost of needed additional personnel. For the\r\nbiennium 2002-2003, the Court has requested\r\nsubstantial appropriations. My delegation supports the\r\nallocation of more resources to the Court to enable it\r\neffectively to discharge its statutory functions and\r\nobligations.\r\nMy delegation values the various publications of\r\nthe International Court of Justice. Those publications\r\ninclude reports of judgments, advisory opinions and\r\norders issued by the Court. We regret the backlog in the\r\npublication of those vital documents, which are\r\ninvaluable to the development and codification of\r\ninternational law. We believe that easy access to those\r\npublications, especially by developing countries, would\r\ncreate greater awareness and understanding among\r\nthem of the work of the Court and of international law.\r\nWe therefore welcome the new volumes published\r\nwithin the period under review. We urge the Court to\r\nexpedite action on the publication of its various\r\ndocuments as soon as more resources are made\r\navailable to it.\r\nMy delegation shares the view expressed in the\r\nreport that, during the period 2000-2001, the Court\r\ncarried out its judicial task with care and\r\ndetermination. We welcome the increased confidence\r\nwhich States have shown in the Court’s ability to\r\nresolve disputes peacefully. We believe that the ideal of\r\nthe primacy of the law in inter-State relations\r\nconstitutes the Court’s raison d’être. We urge that\r\nrelations between States continue to be founded on\r\nmutual respect, desire for peace and the rule of law.\r\nMy delegation is only too aware that the task of\r\nthe Court is not an easy one, considering the political\r\ncoloration of some of the disputes referred to it. That\r\nnotwithstanding, the Court has played its role well, as\r\nreflected in its rulings, orders and judgments. I\r\ntherefore believe that it is in the interest of Member\r\nStates to assist the Court to maintain the high standard\r\nof arbitration that it has set in the pacific settlement of\r\ndisputes between States parties to its Statute.\r\nMs. Xue Hanqin (China) (spoke in Chinese): At\r\nthe outset, I wish on behalf of the Chinese delegation\r\nto express our sincere thanks to Judge Gilbert\r\nGuillaume, President of the International Court of\r\nJustice, for his concise and excellent report on the work\r\nof the Court (A/56/4).\r\nThe International Court of Justice is not only one\r\nof the principal organs of the United Nations; it is also\r\na world-renowned international judicial body. It has\r\nbeen playing an active and important role in the\r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes. Through\r\nits judgments on contentious cases and its advisory\r\nopinions, the Court contributes greatly to the\r\napplication and development of international law. It has\r\nalso had a far-reaching impact on international\r\nrelations and on the forging of a new international\r\norder. The Court’s caseload continues to grow\r\nconsiderably, which shows that the international\r\ncommunity has high expectations of the Court and that\r\nthe Court’s work is outstanding and highly effective.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of international disputes\r\nis one of the basic principles of international law. The\r\nCourt’s judicial independence and impartiality, the high\r\nqualifications of its judges and its universal\r\nrepresentation of the main forms of civilization and of\r\nthe world’s principal legal systems all mean that the\r\nInternational Court of Justice is bound to play an ever\r\nmore important role in the peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational disputes. We have noted that, with the\r\nsteady increase in the number of cases brought before\r\nthe Court, the difficulties faced by the Court in terms\r\nof human and financial resources have become more\r\npalpable and more acute. We call upon the international\r\ncommunity, especially the United Nations and the\r\nparties to the Statute of the Court, to devote greater\r\nattention to this situation and to do their utmost to\r\nenable the Court properly to fulfil its mandate and to\r\nplay its proper role to the fullest.\r\nChina has a history that stretches back 5,000\r\nyears, a magnificent civilization and one of the\r\nprincipal legal systems of the world. We believe that\r\nrepresentation, among the body of judges on the Court,\r\nof the main forms of civilization and of the principal\r\nlegal systems of the world is essential if we are to\r\npreserve the authority and ensure the fairness of the\r\nCourt. The Chinese Government is prepared to\r\ncontinue to contribute in this regard. The Chinese\r\nGovernment attaches great importance to the role of\r\nthe Court in the peaceful settlement of international\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\ndisputes, and has always believed that disputes\r\nbetween States should be resolved through peaceful\r\nmeans, including through negotiation and adjudication.\r\nAs always, the Chinese Government will support the\r\nwork of the International Court of Justice and work\r\ntirelessly to promote the rule of law at the international\r\nlevel and to safeguard world peace.\r\nMr. Perez Giralda (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): It\r\nis an honour for me to address the General Assembly\r\non behalf of the Kingdom of Spain to thank the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for its report and, in\r\nparticular, the President of the Court, Judge Gilbert\r\nGuillaume, for his statement, as well as to reaffirm the\r\ntrust that Spain places in the International Court of\r\nJustice, the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy Government is convinced that it is essential\r\nfor States to place their trust in that lofty tribunal if it\r\nis to be able effectively to discharge its mission in\r\nsettling international disputes, as well as in\r\ncontributing to peacemaking through deciding on\r\nissues of international law. Spain has demonstrated\r\nsuch trust by accepting the mandatory jurisdiction of\r\nthe Court and by undertaking, on an ongoing basis,\r\nactivities that demonstrate this acknowledgement, the\r\nmost recent of which was a visit by His Majesty King\r\nDon Juan Carlos to the Peace Palace on 23 October.\r\nOn that occasion, in addition to discussing other\r\nrelevant issues, His Majesty emphasized the\r\nimportance of the International Court of Justice as the\r\ninternational tribunal par excellence because of its\r\nuniversal and general jurisdiction and its recognized\r\nauthority. It is important here to reaffirm those words\r\nof appreciation, in the context of the concern expressed\r\nby the President of the Court about the proliferation of\r\ninternational tribunals and the dangers of legal overlap\r\nor contradiction that that might entail. It should be\r\nrecalled that on previous occasions, the President of the\r\nCourt highlighted the need for a dialogue among\r\njurisdictions in order to try to avoid the potentially\r\nharmful effects of the fragmentation of international\r\nlaw. Spain believes that the International Court of\r\nJustice is the most appropriate institution to channel\r\nsuch a dialogue, as long as the international community\r\nputs its trust in the Court and endows it with the means\r\nof discharging that function. We should also remember\r\nthat both the current President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice and his predecessor referred to\r\nadvisory opinions as representing a possible means of\r\nestablishing such a dialogue and thereby of ensuring\r\nthat the International Court of Justice speaks with an\r\nauthoritative voice.\r\nJudge Guillaume’s comments that Member States\r\nmake frequent use of the International Court of Justice\r\nwere also very encouraging. The universal character of\r\nthe Court is reflected in the diversity of the parties that\r\nparticipate in the cases before it, as well as in the\r\nmultiplicity of the complex issues with which it deals.\r\nThe report of the Court to the General Assembly\r\nprovides a great deal of information about different\r\ncases and other details; there is no need me to refer to\r\nthem here.\r\nSpain is, of course, fully aware of the difficulties\r\nregarding the funding of the International Court of\r\nJustice and of the negative impact that that is having.\r\nHuman and material resources are scarce — although\r\nthe excellent work done by the Court makes that fact\r\nseem irrelevant. Spain therefore hopes that proposals to\r\nincrease the budget of the Court will elicit a favourable\r\nresponse from the relevant bodies.\r\nThe excellent results to which we referred can be\r\nseen in every aspect of the work of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, but we would like in particular to\r\nhighlight its efforts to improve its internal working\r\nmethods by rationalizing the work of its secretariat,\r\nusing new information technology and improving the\r\npractices of the Court itself, as well as its methods of\r\ncooperating with the parties on procedural matters.\r\nFurthermore, its efforts to disseminate information and\r\nnews relating to the Court through its Web site are also\r\nvery useful.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that Spain\r\nhas full confidence in the present and future work of\r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Oe (Japan): It is a great pleasure and honour\r\nfor me to address the Assembly on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Japan. My delegation would like to\r\nthank President Guillaume for his lucid report on the\r\ncurrent situation of the International Court of Justice.\r\nThere is no doubt that the importance of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, given its long history\r\nand solid jurisprudence, and the confidence that States\r\nplace in it, remains unchanged in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Although concerns about the possible\r\nfragmentation of international law due to the\r\nproliferation of international courts have been\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nexpressed in statements made by President Guillaume\r\nand his predecessors in recent years, the International\r\nCourt of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, has no equal with regard to the\r\nimportant role it plays in the development of\r\ninternational law.\r\nAs a State that strongly believes in the rule of law\r\nand firmly upholds the principle of the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, Japan greatly appreciates the\r\nstrenuous efforts and work of the International Court of\r\nJustice. Japan fully supports the spirit of the Court in\r\nstriving to make further contributions to strengthening\r\nthe rule of law and preventing and resolving\r\ninternational crises.\r\nFor its part, to show its firm adherence to the\r\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes, Japan\r\nhas been contributing annually over the past decade to\r\nthe Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to Assist States in\r\nthe Settlement of Disputes through the International\r\nCourt of Justice. Its contributions to the Fund to date\r\namount to $252,000. Judging from past and current\r\nbiannual documents and the proposed biennium\r\nprogramme budgets, the Fund seems to be\r\nunderutilized. In accordance with the belief that a\r\ndispute is better resolved through litigation than\r\nthrough armed conflict, a State that is in urgent need of\r\nresolving a dispute but without proper legal expertise\r\nor assistance would be encouraged to seek recourse to\r\nthe Court by utilizing this Fund.\r\nJapan’s commitment to the Court may also be\r\nseen in the context of its long history of providing\r\nhighly qualified jurists to serve as judges. Indeed,\r\nduring the Permanent Court of International Justice\r\nperiod, three Japanese lawyers served as judges. After\r\nthe creation of the International Court of Justice, Judge\r\nTanaka served from 1961 to 1970, and currently Judge\r\nOda is serving as the most senior judge in the Court.\r\nJudge Oda has indicated his intention to retire after\r\nfinishing his current term, which ends in February\r\n2003. The Government of Japan has decided to present\r\na new candidate for election to the Court in the year\r\n2002. In this way, Japan sincerely hopes to continue\r\ncontributing to the International Court of Justice,\r\nwhose noble mission will be all the more important in\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nBefore concluding my statement, I wish, on\r\nbehalf of the Government of Japan — which is the\r\nsecond largest contributor to the United Nations\r\nbudget — to take this opportunity to touch upon the\r\nissue of the Court’s budget and its appeal for an\r\nincrease for the coming biennium.\r\nJapan is fully aware of the situation in the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. Its workload has grown\r\nsignificantly in recent years, while the resources\r\navailable to it remain limited. The General Assembly,\r\nwhich attaches great importance to the work of the\r\nCourt, in 1999 granted it four additional posts. In\r\naddition, last December, the General Assembly\r\napproved the establishment of 12 translator posts, 2\r\nGeneral Service posts and temporary assistance in the\r\nadditional programme budget of the Court for the\r\nbiennium 2000-2001, despite the tight budgetary\r\nconstraints of the United Nations, which are forcing\r\nmany other bodies to cut their budgets.\r\nAlso, I would like to point out that the Advisory\r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions, with respect to the next biennium\r\nprogramme budget of the Court, recommended the\r\napproval of the 16 additional posts requested by the\r\nCourt. In view of United Nations budgetary constraints,\r\nthe Court should not take lightly such favourable\r\ntreatment by the General Assembly or the possible\r\napproval of future additional posts, although such a\r\nrequest may not be fully granted.\r\nWith that in mind, every State having recourse to\r\nthe International Court of Justice should try its best to\r\nfacilitate the efficient functioning of the Court. In\r\nresponse to the Court’s appeal, an applicant State can\r\nreduce the burden it places on the Court and expedite\r\nthe proceedings, for instance, by keeping to the\r\nminimum necessary the volume of its written pleadings\r\nand the length of oral arguments. We look forward to\r\nthe Court’s continuing efforts to improve, rationalize\r\nand update the practices and procedures in question in\r\norder to ensure the continued support of Member States\r\nand their taxpayers for its activities.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress once again\r\nJapan’s willingness to contribute to the strengthening\r\nof the International Court of Justice to enable it\r\nefficiently to accomplish the mission expected of it in\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nMr. Tarabrin (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Let me begin by thanking the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Guillaume, for\r\npresenting the report of the body over which he\r\npresides.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nThe Russian Federation is convinced that the\r\nInternational Court has a leading part to play in\r\ndefending the norms and principles of international\r\nlaw, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nin particular the principle of the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes between States. Although Article 33 of the\r\nCharter provides States with a broad range of means to\r\nresolve disputes arising between them, experience has\r\nshown that the Court is the most authoritative body to\r\nwhich a State can have recourse for a solution to the\r\nthorniest of problems. We also see the Court as being\r\nvery important in the field of the prevention of the\r\nunlawful use of force in international relations.\r\nAs the primary judicial organ of the United\r\nNations, the International Court of Justice has a central\r\nrole in the development of jurisprudential practice in\r\nthe field of international law. In this respect, we call for\r\na broader use of mechanisms for judicial supervision of\r\nthe provision of guarantees that violations of the norms\r\nof international law will not be permitted.\r\nThe role of the Court in interpreting the norms of\r\ninternational law is also a major one. In fact, it would\r\nbe difficult to imagine any progressive development of\r\ninternational law without the Court.\r\nThe radical changes we have seen in the nature of\r\ninternational relations over the last 10 years have led to\r\nan increasing interest by States in the International\r\nCourt of Justice as a means of settling their disputes. A\r\nclear sign of this is the great increase in the number of\r\ncases before it and also the broad geographical spread\r\nof the countries bringing cases before the Court.\r\nWe see this trend as positive, and we hope that it\r\nwill continue into the foreseeable future. However, this\r\ndoes place an additional burden of responsibility both\r\non the Court itself and on the United Nations as a\r\nwhole. We welcome the steps that have already been\r\ntaken by the Court to increase its efficiency and\r\nenhance its methods of work, which have allowed\r\ncases to be heard a little more quickly. However, the\r\npace — with a few exceptions — remains too slow. We\r\ntherefore would like to recommend that the Court\r\nshould further reflect on how it could increase its\r\nproductivity within the framework of the Statute,\r\nwithout prejudice to the quality of its judgments and\r\nadvisory opinions.\r\nOn the other hand, it is equally clear that if it is\r\neffectively to fulfil its functions in a changed world,\r\nthe Court need adequate resources. We cannot fail to\r\nnote, in this respect, that in recent years the Court’s\r\nfinancing has been a cause for concern. Indeed, the\r\nbudget of the highest organ in the United Nations\r\nsystem is several times lower than that of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which\r\nseems, in our view, to be unjustified.\r\nIt looks as though the situation will improve in\r\nthe coming biennium. We support the proposal to\r\nincrease the Court’s budget and also allow for a modest\r\nincrease in its staff, but on the understanding that this\r\nwill not affect the level of the United Nations regular\r\nbudget for the biennium 2002-2003.\r\nOne of the clearest of recent trends — and this is\r\nvery closely connected with the confirmation of the\r\nsupremacy of law in international relations — is the\r\nincreasing number of international judicial organs that\r\nare being established — the International Tribunal for\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, the International Tribunal for\r\nRwanda, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea and the special court that is being set up for Sierra\r\nLeone — not to mention the upcoming entry into force\r\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nThis trend is of course positive, but it also has a\r\nnegative side because it increases the risk of\r\nundermining the unity of international law and\r\nencouraging the emergence of legal precedents that\r\nmight contradict one another. That in turn could lead to\r\na situation where States succumb to the temptation of\r\napplying to whichever court they consider to be the\r\nmost convenient one available. In that light, we should\r\nthink about developing procedures so that, when\r\nnecessary, contentious issues of international law\r\narising in the course of the activities of any\r\ninternational judicial organ could be submitted to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for an advisory opinion.\r\nIn conclusion, may I express our confidence that\r\nthe Assembly’s discussion of the report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice will help to draw the\r\ninternational community’s attention to the Court’s\r\nactivities and serve the cause of improving\r\ncoordination among the work of the main United\r\nNations organs in pursuing the Organization’s core\r\ngoals.\r\nMr. Kim Eun-soo (Republic of Korea): It is an\r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly on the\r\noccasion of the examination of the annual report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nThis morning Judge Gilbert Guillaume, the\r\nPresident of the Court, has delivered his statement on\r\nthe overall situation of this principal judicial organ of\r\nthe United Nations. His remarks summarized the\r\nCourt’s work and activities, which have been\r\nremarkable over the past year. My delegation would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to commend President\r\nGuillaume on his superb leadership since his\r\ninauguration in February of last year and his success in\r\ncarrying out the important missions entrusted to the\r\nCourt.\r\nSome of the Court’s achievements deserve our\r\nparticular attention. This year, the Court put an end to a\r\nlong-standing dispute between Qatar and Bahrain by\r\nvirtue of its judgment of 16 March in the case\r\nconcerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial\r\nQuestions between Qatar and Bahrain. Due to the\r\ncomplicated nature of this case combining questions of\r\nboth the territorial sovereignty of islands and maritime\r\ndelimitation, it took the Court 10 years to reach its\r\nfinal decision. It is my delegation’s view that the\r\njudgment, given its insightful reasoning and analysis,\r\nwill be recorded and referred to as one of the most\r\nimportant judicial decisions in the Court’s history in\r\nthe field of territorial disputes and maritime boundary\r\ndelimitations.\r\nFrom a methodological point of view, my\r\ndelegation wishes to note one particular point in the\r\njudgment of the International Court of Justice. In\r\ndrawing the single maritime boundary line between\r\nQatar and Bahrain, the Court began by provisionally\r\nestablishing the median line and proceeded to make\r\nadjustments in order to achieve an equitable result. The\r\nmethod adopted in this case seems to be well in line\r\nwith the approach taken by the Court in previous,\r\nsimilar cases. My delegation is of the view that the\r\ncontinued application of this approach in the future\r\nwould be desirable for the sake of uniformity and\r\nconsistency in the international jurisprudence of\r\nmaritime boundary delimitation.\r\nAs pointed out by previous speakers, another\r\nlandmark judgment of the Court was that of the\r\nLaGrand case. In its ruling, the Court recognized for\r\nthe first time the binding nature of its orders for the\r\nindication of provisional measures under article 41 of\r\nthe Statute. Given the ambiguity of the legal effect of\r\nprovisional measures prior to this case, my delegation\r\nfeels that the LaGrand judgment will serve to\r\nstrengthen the role and authority of the Court and also\r\nencourage States to make use of it more frequently.\r\nThe number of cases coming before the Court has\r\nrisen substantially during the last decade, significantly\r\nincreasing its workload. The current number of cases\r\non the Court’s docket attests to this. While this\r\ndevelopment reflects the inclination of more States to\r\nseek settlement of disputes by judicial means, it has\r\noverburdened the Court and made it difficult to handle\r\ncases in a timely fashion. These problems were pointed\r\nout in last year’s report of the Joint Inspection Unit on\r\nthe International Court of Justice, which made several\r\nuseful recommendations to help deal with this new\r\nchallenge. A great deal of effort has been made so far\r\nto enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the\r\nCourt, and the outcome has generally been successful.\r\nAccordingly, my delegation welcomes the resolution of\r\nthe General Assembly of 22 June, in which the\r\nAssembly noted that problems in the management of\r\nthe Registry of the Court had been resolved to a large\r\nextent.\r\nFor the purpose of improving efficiency, last\r\nDecember the Court took an important step towards\r\nsimplifying its procedures by amending two relevant\r\narticles concerning preliminary objections and counter-\r\nclaims. The amendments aim to shorten the duration of\r\nthe Court’s proceedings, to clarify the existing rules\r\nand to adapt them to reflect more closely the practice\r\ndeveloped by the Court. These measures are part of a\r\nseries of endeavours undertaken since 1997 to\r\nrationalize the work of the Court. My country fully\r\nsupports these initiatives and hopes that the Court will\r\ncontinue its efforts to improve efficiency, in order to\r\nprovide the international community with even better\r\nlegal service.\r\nAs the only international judicial institution, the\r\nInternational Court of Justice is now being called upon\r\nto play a more active role in promoting world peace\r\nbased upon the rule of law. This can indeed be made\r\npossible through the increased use of the Court on the\r\npart of States and unreserved cooperation and support\r\nfrom the international community as a whole.\r\nHowever, a considerable increase in the Court’s budget\r\nseems to be necessary in order for it to deal with its\r\nheavy workload and overcome the difficulties in its\r\nadministration and management. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation is of the view that President Guillaume’s\r\nproposed budget for the next biennium should receive\r\nfavourable consideration. A revitalized and more\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nefficient Court with sufficient funding, we believe,\r\nwould be a great benefit to all members of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn concluding, my delegation would like to\r\nreaffirm its full confidence in, and its support for, the\r\ninvaluable work of the International Court of Justice in\r\nthe development and promotion of the role of law in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nMr. Kamto (Cameroon) (spoke in French): It is\r\nalways a great pleasure and honour for the delegation\r\nof Cameroon to hear the traditional statement by the\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice on the\r\nactivities of the Court. I thank the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for the clarity of his\r\nstatement. I also take this opportunity to extend our\r\ncongratulations not only to President Gilbert\r\nGuillaume, but also to all the members of the Court.\r\nMy delegation would like to encourage the Court’s\r\ntangible contribution to the maintenance of peace\r\nbetween nations through the law. We also commend the\r\nCourt’s remarkable efforts to deal with the various\r\ncases before it in the shortest time possible. The fact\r\nthat there are many more cases on the Court’s docket is\r\na clear sign of the increasing confidence of States in\r\nthe authority of the highest court in the world. This is\r\nsomething we should welcome. Let us hope that the\r\ntrend continues, for the sake of international peace.\r\nTwo points in the President’s statement were of\r\nparticular interest to my delegation. The first concerned\r\nthe LaGrand affair. The decisions handed down in this\r\ncase indeed constitute a high point in the legal history\r\nof the Court, for at least three reasons. The first is the\r\nfact that the decisions are a very clear indication of the\r\nCourt’s sensitivity to the right to life. This is evident in\r\nthe order dated 3 March 1999 containing provisional\r\nmeasures, which was handed down with unprecedented\r\nspeed — in fact, in just 24 hours, as the case went\r\nbefore the Court on 2 March. The firm language of the\r\norder is a sign of the Court’s keenness to save the lives\r\nof the two LaGrand brothers, who had not yet been\r\nexecuted. The Court demanded that Mr. Walter\r\nLaGrand not be executed until a final decision had\r\nbeen handed down, and that the respondent State report\r\nback to the Court all the measures it would take to\r\ncomply with the order.\r\nThere was also the judgment of 27 June 2001, in\r\nwhich the Court pronounced itself on the substance of\r\nthe case. This contributed to strengthening consular\r\nlaw as part of international law. The Court decided that\r\nthe rules of domestic law — and in particular the rules\r\ngoverning legal proceedings under domestic law —\r\ncould not be allowed to undermine the rules of\r\ninternational law, to which this particular State had\r\nsubscribed. The Court affirmed that when applying its\r\nown domestic law — which prevented Karl and Walter\r\nLaGrand from putting their claims forward under the\r\nVienna Convention on Consular Relations, of 24 April\r\n1963 — the respondent State had violated its\r\ninternational obligations under the Convention.\r\nFinally, what is particularly important is that the\r\nCourt’s ruling in the LaGrand case decides a question\r\nthat has long been at the fore in debate on doctrine: the\r\nlegal force of orders for the indication of provisional\r\nmeasures given by the highest court in the world. Last\r\nyear Cameroon became one of those countries\r\nadvocating making such orders binding upon those to\r\nwhom they are addressed. Cameroon is not so foolish\r\nas to imagine that its view in any way influenced the\r\ndecision of the Court in the LaGrand case, but we note\r\nwith satisfaction that the Court decided that these\r\norders are binding. The Court was absolutely\r\nunambiguous on this, saying:\r\n“by failing to take all measures at its disposal to\r\nensure that Walter LaGrand was not executed\r\npending the final decision of the International\r\nCourt of Justice in the case, the United States of\r\nAmerica breached the obligation incumbent upon\r\nit under the Order indicating provisional\r\nmeasures issued by the Court on 3 March 1999”.\r\n(A/56/4, p. 43)\r\nThe delegation of Cameroon welcomes this dictum of\r\nthe judgment of 27 June 2001, which fully justifies the\r\nprocedure of provisional measures before the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nThe second matter in the report that drew my\r\ndelegation’s attention was the amendment of articles 79\r\nand 80 of the Rules of Court, and the modification of\r\nthe note containing recommendations to the parties.\r\nThe delegation of Cameroon welcomes these changes,\r\nwhich have a single goal — to accelerate proceedings\r\non preliminary objections and requests for counter-\r\nclaims, thus preventing such procedural matters from\r\nparalysing the Court’s activities and preventing States\r\nparties to a case before the Court from feeling as if\r\nthey have been put through the mill before their cases\r\nare heard.\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.32\r\nThe high cost of Court proceedings and the hope\r\nfor a speedy and definitive Court decision which\r\ninspires every applicant State are incompatible with the\r\nslow progress allowed by the provisions before they\r\nwere amended. Through these amendments, the Court\r\nforces parties to a dispute to assume their\r\nresponsibilities, while giving the Court’s legal\r\nprocesses the ability to remain in control of the\r\nproceedings. International justice is bound to be more\r\neffective as a result.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Acting President: Before calling on the next\r\nspeaker, I should now like to draw members’ attention\r\nto the announcement in today’s Journal concerning\r\nagenda item 49, “Question of equitable representation\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and related matters”, the third item to be taken\r\nup this afternoon. For this agenda item there is no\r\ndocumentation at this time.\r\nFollowing the practice of previous sessions, the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to the Security Council will report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly next year, after having concluded its\r\nwork at the fifty-sixth session.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof the members to two draft resolutions, under the\r\nsymbols A/56/L.6 and A/56/L.7, that have been\r\ndistributed to delegations this morning.\r\nDraft resolution A/56/L.6 contains the new dates\r\nfor consideration by the General Assembly of agenda\r\nitem 25, entitled “United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations”, originally scheduled for 3 and 4\r\nDecember 2001, in accordance with Assembly\r\nresolution 55/23 of 13 November 2000.\r\nDraft resolution A/56/L.7, under agenda item 26,\r\ncontains the new dates for the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on children, originally scheduled for\r\n19 to 24 September 2001, in accordance with Assembly\r\nresolution 55/26 of 20 November 2000.\r\nTo facilitate planning for delegations, the General\r\nAssembly will take up agenda item 25 this afternoon as\r\nthe first item, for the purpose of considering draft\r\nresolution A/56/L.6, followed by agenda item 26, for\r\nthe purpose of considering draft resolution A/56/L.7.\r\nThereafter, the Assembly will consider agenda item 49,\r\nas announced in the Journal today.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n"
